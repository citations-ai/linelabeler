2:33:1749:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We provide empirical support for the conventional wisdom that there are times when optimistic investors
2:34:1852:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tend to build their hopes into castles in the air, and pay a large premium over intrinsic value for stocks
2:35:1958:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of firms in the early stages of their life cycles with perceived growth opportunities. We use industry
2:36:2060:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:IPO waves containing a set of firms in the same industry that went public at about the same time in
2:37:2159:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a cluster to identify those time periods and firms that are relatively homogenous and in the same early
2:38:2262:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:growth stages of their life cycles. We find that three years after an industry IPO wave ends, among
2:39:2361:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the firms in the wave with relatively high historical sales growth rates, those with low gross margins
2:40:2463:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are over-valued relative to firms with high gross margins. They under-perform their industry IPO wave
2:41:2564:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:peers by 0.92% per month, or about 12% per year, during the subsequent four-year period after adjusting
2:42:2667:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for risk and firm characteristics differentials. Further, the average future returns on these firms are
2:43:2770:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:even below the corresponding risk-free returns. Our findings contribute to the literature on inefficient
2:44:2874:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital markets by identifying situations when prices of some stocks are likely to be affected by bounded
2:45:2979:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rationality or biases in the way investors make decisions, and agency issues limit the ability of more
2:46:3081:14:14:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sophisticated arbitrageurs who have to rely on other people’s money from exploiting any resultant
2:47:3178:14:42:72:168:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:profit opportunities.

3:66:3600:0:37:264:350:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:I. Introduction 
3:67:3615:37:27:72:543:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Firms  in  the  early  stages  of  their  lifecycle  are  typically  resource  constrained  and  face  a 
3:68:3720:27:28:72:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fundamental strategic tradeoff. They can focus their efforts on a growth  strategy that involves 
3:69:3817:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increasing sales at a rapid rate based on the view that the resultant increased market share will 
3:70:3915:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:give a permanent competitive advantage due to economies of scale. Alternatively, they can focus 
3:71:4011:27:28:72:542:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on a margin strategy that involves improving profit margins assuming that higher margins reflect 
3:72:4108:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increased customer satisfaction, leading to sustainable profitable growth over the long run. The 
3:73:4205:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:former choice becomes more attractive during periods when optimistic investors “tend to build 
3:74:4299:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their  hopes  into  castles  in  the  air”1 and  are  willing  to  pay  a  large  premium  for  stocks  with 
3:75:4408:28:37:72:228:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:perceived growth opportunities. 
3:76:4440:37:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:   Aghion and Stein (2008) analyze such a tradeoff in a theoretical model that allows two-way 
3:77:4534:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:feedback  between  firms’  strategies  and  the  market’s  pricing  rule. They  show  that  at  times 
3:78:4636:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors may pay too much for growth opportunities thereby encouraging managers to focus on 
3:79:4729:28:28:72:542:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sales growth, and some may do so even at the expense of margins.2 They refer to those times as 
3:80:4824:28:27:72:542:302:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f2:growth equilibrium.  In the bounded rationality version of their model where investors follow a 
3:81:4920:27:28:72:542:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simple linear forecasting rule, they make the following prediction: “... in a growth equilibrium 
3:82:5017:28:28:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the  market  fully  impounds  all  growth-related  information,  but  ignores  margins-related 
3:83:5112:28:76:72:503:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:information. ... firms with weak profit margins will be overvalued (page 1051 op. cit.).” 3

3:86:5279:12:16:72:535:124:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2 The 'catering' by managers to market sentiment could be common if managers are interested in boosting short-run 
3:87:5393:16:11:72:524:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:share prices. See Polk and Sapienza (2008) for the evidence on managers' deviation from optimal investments in 
3:88:5504:11:7:72:304:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:response to investors' sentiment and mispricing in shares. 
3:89:5563:7:16:72:522:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3 Hong, Stein and Yu (2007) discuss various reasons why investors sometime may oversimplify the information 
3:90:5671:16:0:72:326:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:structure and rely on simple univariate models for forecasting.  
4:91:5738:0:28:90:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Testing such a prediction is challenging: among other things, it requires the identification of 
4:92:5834:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a group of similar firms and time periods when the stock market is in a growth equilibrium and 
4:93:5929:28:27:72:542:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over-fixated on sales growth numbers. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on a 
4:94:6025:27:28:72:542:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:set of firms in the same industry that went public at about the same time in a cluster, commonly 
4:95:6122:28:37:72:378:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:referred to as an industry IPO wave, for the following reasons.  
4:96:6187:37:28:90:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(a)  Firms  that  went  public  at  about  the  same  time  in  the  same  industry  are  likely  to  be 
4:97:6292:28:38:72:441:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively homogeneous in the same early growth stage of their life cycles.    
4:98:6371:38:27:90:547:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(b )  According to the  popular Boston Consulting Group Model (BCG, 1968), a firm should 
4:99:6460:27:28:72:543:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximize sales growth and market share early in its life cycle in order to create permanent cost 
4:100:6557:28:27:72:542:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and customer relationship related advantages over their competitors.4 Hence there are a priori 
4:101:6652:27:28:72:546:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reasons to believe that firms in an industry IPO wave are likely to focus on gaining market share.  
4:102:6752:28:28:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Chemmanur and He (2011) argue that gaining market share is an important reason why these 
4:103:6841:28:37:72:325:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms go public together in an industry IPO wave.     
4:104:6894:37:28:90:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(c) There is ample anecdotal evidence that over-emphasis on market share may lead some 
4:105:6981:28:27:72:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managers to focus excessively on short-term sales growth in their early life cycle stage without 
4:106:7078:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regard to costs and benefits, especially when facing intense product market competition.  For 
4:107:7172:28:28:72:543:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:example, Adizes (1988) in his classical book on corporate life cycles mentions: “... the selling 
4:108:7269:28:27:72:542:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:orientation  becomes  addictive,  with more  meaning better...  However,  as  they  expand 
4:109:7360:27:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uncontrollably, their cost accounting becomes useless. Eventually, they might be selling more, 
4:110:7455:28:68:72:493:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:but instead of making more profits, they might be losing money (page 35-36 op. cit.).”  
4:111:7543:68:8:216:219:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
4:112:7591:8:0:72:466:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:4 See Spence 1977, 1979, and 1981 for related discussions in the industrial organization literature. 
5:113:7694:0:28:90:547:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(d )  Industry  IPO  waves  often  coincide  with  increasing  valuation  uncertainty  (Pastor  and 
5:114:7794:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Veronesi,  2005).  Given  the  likely  large  dispersion  in  the  prior  beliefs  of  investors  regarding 
5:115:7902:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which firms will be market leaders in an emerging industry, each firm is likely to develop a 
5:116:7995:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:clientele of optimistic investors who  are  fixated  on the reported sales  growth and ignore the 
5:117:8093:28:37:72:322:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated costs and sustainability of that growth.5   
5:118:8148:37:28:90:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(e) Since firms can time when they go public, industry IPO waves are more likely to occur 
5:119:8238:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:when investors are optimistic and the market is in the Aghion and Stein (2008) type growth 
5:120:8329:28:37:72:381:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equilibrium with some managers following the growth strategy. 
5:121:8391:37:28:90:543:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(f)  An  industry  IPO  wave  is  likely  triggered  by  major  technological  or  demand  shocks 
5:122:8489:28:27:72:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:affecting that industry as a whole and these shocks may take several  years to play out, with 
5:123:8583:27:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:optimistic views prevailing for a long period of time. Hence the limits to arbitrage arguments in 
5:124:8681:28:28:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Shleifer and Vishny (1997) are more likely to apply, and prevent arbitrageurs from correcting 
5:125:8775:28:37:72:192:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mispricing immediately. 
5:126:8799:37:28:90:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our empirical results provide strong support for the Aghion and Stein (2008) prediction that 
5:127:8892:28:27:72:542:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms with weak margins will be overpriced in a bounded-rationality growth equilibrium. We 
5:128:8983:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:confirm that a low gross margin is a leading indicator of an industry IPO wave firm’s poor future 
5:129:9081:28:38:72:194:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stock price performance. 
5:130:9106:38:27:90:545:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ANSYS (NASDAQ: ANSS) and CSG System (NASDAQ: CSGS) help illustrate our findings. 
5:131:9187:27:29:72:543:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:They both went public in 1996 during an IPO wave in the computer software industry that started 
5:132:9283:29:7:216:219:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
5:133:9331:7:16:72:542:136:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:5 Optimism is  what leads to innovations and doing the impossible. For example, it is believed that Lord Kelvin 
5:134:9443:16:12:72:542:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(President of the Royal Society) declared in 1895 that heavier than air flying machines are impossible -- but a mere 
5:135:9560:12:11:72:543:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:eight years later, the Wright brothers flew their machine in 1903! History is full of such examples. But not for the 
5:136:9677:11:12:72:542:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Dot  Com  bubble  we  may  not  have  eBay,  Amazon,  and  Google.  However,  while  humanity  benefits  from  such 
5:137:9793:12:11:72:542:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:endeavors, an average investor may not, which is consistent with the findings in Ritter (2012) that per capita GDP 
5:138:9908:11:0:72:341:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:growth is negatively correlated with stock returns across countries. 
6:139:9978:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in March 1995  and ended in January 1997. They  differed in one important dimension: gross 
6:140:10069:28:28:72:551:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin. During the fiscal years 1998 and  1999, ANSYS had an average gross margin of 87% and 
6:141:10162:28:27:72:542:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:its sales grew annually at 14% on average. While CSG achieved a much higher average growth 
6:142:10253:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate of 33% per year, its average gross margin was only 51%. The future stock price path of the 
6:143:10349:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two firms diverged. While ANSYS returned about 470% in the next four years, CSG lost more 
6:144:10439:27:38:72:325:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 60% of its market value over the same period.   
6:145:10492:38:28:90:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:When we trace all U.S. IPOs in industry IPO waves from 1980 through their initial firm life 
6:146:10584:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cycle   stages,  we  find  that  firms  like  CSG,  i.e.,  those  with relatively  high  sales  growth  but 
6:147:10692:27:28:72:543:478:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f2:relatively low gross margins, are associated with poor future stock price performance on average. 
6:148:10790:28:27:72:542:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For each industry IPO wave, at the end of event year 3, where event year 0 denotes the year in 
6:149:10885:27:28:72:542:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which the industry IPO wave ended, we do a two-by-two sequential sort of firms based on their 
6:150:10979:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:book-to-market equity ratios (BM) and the average gross margins (GM) in fiscal years 1 and 2.6 
6:151:11073:28:27:72:542:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We find that low-BM-low-GM IPO firms underperform their industry peers by more than 30% in 
6:152:11164:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the subsequent four years on average, translating to a loss of market capitalization of more than 
6:153:11262:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$200 million per firm. In contrast, low-BM-high-GM IPO firms, while having an average initial 
6:154:11356:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sales growth rate (45% per year in the fiscal years 1 and 2) and an average initial  BM ratio (0.28 
6:155:11456:28:28:72:542:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at the end of event year 3) that are about the same as their low-GM peers, do not underperform. 
6:156:11552:28:27:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This  event-time  comparison  delivers  two  key  observations  that  are  consistent  with  the 
6:157:11649:27:28:72:543:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:predictions in Aghion and Stein (2008): (1) IPO firms with high initial sales growth rates have 
6:158:11745:28:54:72:543:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high market valuations (lower BMs) on average regardless of their initial GMs; (2) IPO firms 
6:159:11838:54:7:216:219:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
6:160:11886:7:16:72:542:113:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:6 We allow for a minimum of 3-month lag for book values to be available after the end of the fiscal year. We use the 
6:161:12003:16:12:72:542:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stock prices corresponding to the last day of the last calendar month in event year 3. We check the robustness of our 
6:162:12121:12:11:72:542:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conclusions by allowing for a minimum of 12-month lag for book values to be available after the end of the fiscal 
6:163:12235:11:0:72:94:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:year. 
7:164:12243:0:28:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with low GMs but similarly high valuations (lower BMs) are initially over-valued in the market, 
7:165:12339:28:37:72:260:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:leading to long-run underperformance. 
7:166:12377:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We confirm our findings in the event-time analysis using both calendar-time analysis and 
7:167:12466:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:panel regressions. Calendar-time analysis suggests that, after risk adjustment, low-BM-low-GM 
7:168:12560:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO firms underperform their industry benchmarks by more than 1% per month on average. This 
7:169:12652:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underperformance is robust to various modifications to the empirical design of trading strategies 
7:170:12750:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such as sample period, portfolio formation time, holding horizon, and the definition of industry 
7:171:12847:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO waves. While replacing GM with  other profitability measures such as profit margin and 
7:172:12938:27:28:72:542:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:return on assets  produces  qualitatively similar results,  which is  not  surprising  given the high 
7:173:13040:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correlations among different measures, GM performs the best in separating the future losers from 
7:174:13137:27:28:72:546:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their peers among low -BM IPO firms. Further, using sales growth rate instead of BM to identify 
7:175:13233:28:28:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth  firms  produces  very  similar  underperformance  (78  bps  per  month)  of  low-GM-high-
7:176:13330:28:37:72:166:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth IPO firms.  
7:177:13349:37:28:90:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Additional analysis reveals three more interesting observations that are consistent with the 
7:178:13442:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:predictions of Aghion and Stein (2008). First, it is crucial to condition our analysis on “industry 
7:179:13542:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO  waves”  that  control  for  an  IPO  firm's  industry  peers  in  the  same  growth  equilibrium. 
7:180:13645:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Grouping  all  IPOs  in  the  same  industry  simply  by  calendar  years  generates  a  much  weaker 
7:181:13747:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underperformance  of  low-BM-low-GM  IPO  firms  (only  29  bps  per  month).  When  all 
7:182:13836:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CRSP/COMPUSTAT  stocks  are  examined,  the  underperformance  is  almost  economically 
7:183:13924:28:27:72:544:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:insignificant, a mere 6 bps per month. Second, we find the underperformance of low-BM-low -
7:184:14015:27:28:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM  stocks  to  be  much  stronger  among  industries  and  during  times  with  more  competitive 
7:185:14114:28:0:72:542:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:product markets. Finally, we confirm that the stock price response for low-BM-low-GM IPO 
8:186:14205:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms to changes in sales growth rates is much stronger, even after controlling for changes in 
8:187:14300:28:37:72:410:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earnings, but only during the first two years after the end of the wave. 
8:188:14373:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consistent  with  the  bounded-rationality  equilibrium  of  Aghion  and  Stein  (2008),  we  find 
8:189:14472:28:28:72:546:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence  supporting  the  view  that  the  investors  of  low-BM-low -GM  IPO  firms  were  too 
8:190:14569:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:optimistic about the long-run growth prospects of the firms. That may be due to the use of simple 
8:191:14667:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:linear models for forecasting as in Aghion and Stein (2008) without recognizing that high past 
8:192:14762:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth rates do not persist for very long into the future, especially when the firm is financially 
8:193:14861:28:27:72:547:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:weak as evidenced by relatively low gross margins. We find that the low-BM-low -GM IPO firms 
8:194:14954:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:do not achieve higher market share and improved profitability in the long run. Using analyst 
8:195:15047:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:forecasts, we find that their stock underperformance from event year 4 to 7 is primarily driven by 
8:196:15146:27:38:72:474:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:downward revisions in expectations about long-run earnings beyond event year 13. 
8:197:15227:38:27:90:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We find that low-BM-low-GM IPO firms are associated with greater uncertainty about their 
8:198:15316:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:future.  Their  earnings  forecasts  are  associated  with  significantly  higher  dispersions.  Their 
8:199:15419:28:28:72:542:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic volatilities are also higher. When conducting textual analysis of the Risk Factor 
8:200:15515:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sections in the IPO prospectus available for a subset of IPO firms in our sample, we find that 
8:201:15610:27:28:72:542:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-BM-low-GM IPOs indeed witness more mentions of “Cost(s)” and “Profitability” in their 
8:202:15700:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Risk Factors sections. In addition, we find that on average, low-BM-low-GM IPO stocks are held 
8:203:15795:27:28:72:542:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significantly  less  by  corporate  insiders  and  mutual  funds  compared  to  their  high-GM 
8:204:15890:28:28:72:542:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:counterparts.  Overall,  greater  uncertainties  and  lower  ownership  by  sophisticated,  better 
8:205:15989:28:27:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:informed investors, in the presence of limits-to-arbitrage, may explain why the prices of such 
8:206:16084:27:28:72:546:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks continue to fall over three to four years in the future. Limits-to-arbitrage may arise due to  
8:207:16186:28:0:72:543:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:direct as well as indirect short-selling costs, agency issues that make it difficult to access capital 
9:208:16291:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:markets  during  margin  calls,  and  high  idiosyncratic  risk  that  makes  it less  attractive  to  risk-
9:209:16399:28:37:72:268:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:averse arbitrageurs with limited capital.  
9:210:16442:37:28:90:542:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In a related paper, Novy-Marx (2012) shows that firms with high gross-profit-to-asset ratio 
9:211:16534:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(GPA) earn higher returns going forward, even after controlling for their book-to-market ratios. 
9:212:16631:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since GPA is the product of gross margin (GM) and asset turnover (AT, i.e., sales / total assets), 
9:213:16730:27:28:72:542:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:keeping valuation and AT fixed, one should also expect GM to be positively related to average 
9:214:16824:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns in the cross-section. Our paper goes further in two important ways. First, we show that 
9:215:16920:28:27:72:542:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM is the key predictor of future returns among firms in their early life-cycle stages that initially 
9:216:17022:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:receive high valuations. Second and more importantly, while Brav, Geczy, and Gompers (2000) 
9:217:17114:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Brav, Michaely, Roberts, and Zarutskie (2009) argue that lower post-equity-issuance stock 
9:218:17208:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns could reflect lower risks, we find that average future returns on these low-BM-low-GM 
9:219:17302:28:28:72:542:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms  are  even  below  the  corresponding  risk-free  returns.7 Such  a  low  return  is  difficult  to 
9:220:17408:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reconcile  with  a  positive  risk  premium  for  bearing  economy-wide  systematic  risk  in  an 
9:221:17506:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:informationally efficient market unless one can argue that realized returns were influenced by 
9:222:17601:28:37:72:189:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unforeseen rare events.  
9:223:17626:37:28:90:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The findings in our paper are related to but different from those in the voluminous literature 
9:224:17721:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on IPO long-run underperformance (see Ritter (1991), Loughran and Ritter (1995), Brav, Geczy, 
9:225:17815:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Gompers (2000) among many others). One key distinction is the horizon over which IPO 
9:226:17904:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:performance is measured. While the IPO long-run underperformance literature mostly focuses on 
9:227:17998:28:27:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the first three to five years immediately after the offering date, we focus on the horizon from 
9:228:18094:27:40:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:event years 4 to 7 after the ending year of an industry IPO wave. For example, using a clever 
9:229:18188:40:7:216:219:97:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
9:230:18236:7:16:72:538:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7 In the event time, the buy-and-hold excess return over the risk-free rate during the 4-year holding period is -6.24% 
9:231:18355:16:0:72:215:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for the low-BM-low-GM portfolio. 
10:232:18390:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:empirical design, Purnanandam and Swaminathan (2004) find that IPOs, especially those with 
10:233:18481:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high sales growth forecasts and lower profitability measures, are systematically overvalued at the 
10:234:18580:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:offer price relative to their valuations based on industry peer multiples, and the overvalued IPOs 
10:235:18679:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provide  high  first  day  returns  but  low  long-run  (over  the  five  years  following  the  IPO)  risk 
10:236:18787:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted  returns.  In  contrast,  we  study  the  overvaluation  of  stocks  three  years  after  the  IPO 
10:237:18895:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fueled by their high post-IPO sales growth rates, and the overvalued IPOs underperform their 
10:238:18988:28:28:72:543:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry IPO wave peers over the following four years. We find that both the gross margin and 
10:239:19082:28:27:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the conditioning on industry IPO waves are important for detecting future underperformance. 
10:240:19174:27:28:72:543:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Pastor and Veronesi (2003) argue that the uncertainty associated with the IPO firms could result 
10:241:19271:28:27:72:542:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in high initial valuation and the subsequent learning about profitability reduces the uncertainty 
10:242:19369:27:28:72:543:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and valuation, thereby providing a rational explanation for  the long-run underperformance of 
10:243:19463:28:28:72:542:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPOs. While such a learning mechanism is consistent with the long-run underperformance of 
10:244:19553:28:27:72:565:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPOs as a group, it should not drive the relative underperformance of low-BM-low-   GM IPOs 
10:245:19645:27:28:72:543:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:within an industry IPO wave as we do not observe a greater reduction in uncertainty measures 
10:246:19738:28:37:72:428:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over time on these low-GM firms relative to their high-GM counterparts.  
10:247:19811:37:28:90:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our paper also contributes to the broader literature on firm life cycle that includes Anthony 
10:248:19905:28:28:72:543:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Ramesh (1992), Berger and Udell (1998), DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Stulz (2006, 2010), and 
10:249:19997:28:27:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Dickinson (2011). One challenge in studying firm life cycle arises from the fact that there is no 
10:250:20095:27:28:72:543:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:easy  and  objective  way  to  classify  firms  into  different  life  cycle  stages.  We  get  around  this 
10:251:20204:28:27:72:543:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:problem  by  focusing  on  industry  IPO  waves,  which  presents  a  model-free  way  to  identify  a 
10:252:20307:27:28:72:543:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sizable cohort of similar firms in the same initial growth stage of their life cycles. Over-fixation 
10:253:20408:28:28:72:543:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on sales growth seems to drive the overvaluation of the growth firms during the initial growth 
10:254:20503:28:0:72:543:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stage of their life cycle. Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), La Porta (1996), La Porta, 
11:255:20601:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997), and Sloan (1996) also mention extrapolation of past 
11:256:20694:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:performance and earnings fixation to explain the difference in returns between growth and value 
11:257:20790:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks.  Piotroski  and  So  (2012)  show  that  the  predictable  value/growth  return  spreads 
11:258:20887:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:concentrate  among  firms  with  ex  ante  identifiable  errors  in  expectations  about  future 
11:259:20984:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fundamental  performance.  We  find  over-fixation  on  sales  growth  and  errors  in  expectations 
11:260:21085:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about future growth and profitability are particularly prevalent for firms in the initial growth 
11:261:21182:28:38:72:186:543:12:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stage of their life cycle. 
11:262:21208:38:27:90:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The rest of our paper is organized as follows: Section II describes our sample of industry IPO 
11:263:21303:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:waves, Section III presents the evidence of the underperformance of growth firms with low gross 
11:264:21399:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin, Section IV reports the results of additional analyses about potential driving forces, and 
11:265:21497:27:38:72:246:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finally Section V briefly concludes. 
11:266:21534:38:38:284:330:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:II. Data 
11:267:21541:38:27:90:543:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our sample consists of firms that went public in the same industry at about the same time. 
11:268:21632:27:28:72:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We collect the data for U.S. IPOs covering the period 1970 to 2010 from Thomson Financial 
11:269:21722:28:27:72:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Security Data Corporation (SDC) and keep only IPOs of only common shares with no attached 
11:270:21812:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:units (warrants) and no accompanying issue of other types of securities. We classify IPOs into 
11:271:21907:28:28:72:543:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fama  and  French  (1997)  49  industries  and  drop  the  unclassified  ones  (those  with  missing 
11:272:22008:28:27:72:542:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry classification) and those classified into the 49th industry.8 We follow the procedure in 
11:273:22106:27:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Chemmanur and He (2011) to identify industry IPO waves based on how clustered the IPOs are 
11:274:22197:28:27:72:542:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in an industry. Specifically, for each industry i and each month t, we count the number of IPOs in 
11:275:22295:27:41:72:543:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 3-month window from t-1 to t+1. We then define an IPO hot month for industry i as one with 
11:276:22390:41:8:216:219:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
11:277:22438:8:0:72:404:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8 We use the updated industry classifications obtained from Ken French’s website. 
12:278:22523:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the 3-month number of IPOs in the top quartile among all months from 1970 to 2010 with at 
12:279:22613:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:least  one  IPO  in  industry i.  Finally, we  classify  IPOs  in  those  consecutive  hot  months  for 
12:280:22717:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry i as an industry IPO wave. We define the beginning month and the ending month of an 
12:281:22810:27:28:72:542:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry IPO wave, for industry i, as the first month and the last month in an unbroken sequence 
12:282:22907:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of hot months for industry i. To avoid standalone IPOs being erroneously classified as a wave, 
12:283:23002:27:38:72:538:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we require a minimum of 5 IPOs in total and 1 IPO every month on average in the wave period.  
12:284:23096:38:28:90:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For each industry IPO wave, the calendar year in which the wave ends is denoted as event 
12:285:23185:28:27:72:539:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year 0. We form portfolios within the wave at the end of event year 3, based on the book-to-
12:286:23277:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market equity ratio at the end of event  year 3 (BM) and the average of gross margins (GM) 
12:287:23368:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during  the  two  fiscal  years  after  event  year  0.9 Figure  I  plots  the  timeline  of  our  portfolio 
12:288:23477:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:formation procedure. This procedure imposes additional filters. For an IPO firm to enter our final 
12:289:23576:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample, it has to: (1) exist in CRSP at the end of event year 3; (2) have positive book value at the 
12:290:23677:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end  of  event  year  3;  and  (3)  have  the  necessary  accounting  information  in  COMPUSTAT 
12:291:23774:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:available during the two fiscal years after event year 0. In addition, we require at least 8 firms in 
12:292:23876:28:27:72:542:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:an industry IPO wave at the end of event year 3 to make sure that our portfolio-level result is not 
12:293:23976:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:driven by a single firm.10 These filters are based on information available by the end of event 
12:294:24072:28:28:72:543:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year 3 and thus do not introduce look-ahead bias. In the end, 1425 IPOs going public during 68 
12:295:24167:28:51:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry  IPO waves from 1980 to 2006 satisfy our portfolio formation requirements. In other 
12:296:24260:51:8:216:219:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
12:297:24308:8:16:72:526:170:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:9 The market equity is measured at the end of event year 3, and the book equity is measured from the most recent 
12:298:24421:16:11:72:527:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fiscal year ending at least 3 months before the end of event year 3. We also do a robustness check by defining the 
12:299:24536:11:12:72:528:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:book-to-market equity ratio as the book equity at the end of fiscal year 2 scaled by the market equity at the end of 
12:300:24653:12:11:72:531:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:event year 3. As can be seen from Panel B of Table IV, the results for calendar-time analysis using this alternative 
12:301:24770:11:12:72:535:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:BM measure are stronger than those in our baseline case. For gross margin, we do not use the number in fiscal year 
12:302:24885:12:7:72:447:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3 since it may not be available yet at the time of portfolio formation, the end of event year 3.  
12:303:24983:7:16:72:533:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:10 To further avoid the undue influence of outliers, we value weight stocks within each portfolio for each wave and 
12:304:25099:16:11:72:526:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:then weight the portfolios across waves based on the number of IPOs at the end of event year 3. We also confirm 
12:305:25211:11:0:72:509:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that equal-weighing stocks within each portfolio and/or across waves do not change our results qualitatively. 
13:306:25324:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:words, our final sample effectively covers the period from 1980 to 2010, including the portfolio 
13:307:25421:28:37:72:148:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:holding period. 
13:308:25437:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Panel A of Table I reports summary statistics for IPOs and industry IPO waves during the 
13:309:25526:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period 1980-2006. We start with 9,898 IPOs. Among them, 3,618 IPOs belong to industry IPO 
13:310:25616:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:waves (on-the-wave). When we require IPOs to appear in COMPUSTAT until the end of event 
13:311:25704:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year 3, the number of IPOs drops to 8,751, and 3,069 of them are on-the-wave, among which 
13:312:25794:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1,425 IPOs in 68 industry IPO waves enter our final sample. As shown in Panel B, the various 
13:313:25887:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:characteristics of the 68 industry IPO waves in our sample are comparable to those from a larger 
13:314:25984:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sample reported in Chemmanur and He (2011).11 The top 5 industries contribute 26 industry IPO 
13:315:26078:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:waves to our sample. Panel C further shows the five biggest industry IPO waves in our sample, 
13:316:26172:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coming from computer software, trading, and business services industries. Altogether, 895 firms 
13:317:26268:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:went public in these top 5 waves, among which 383 IPOs pass various portfolio formation filters 
13:318:26364:28:37:72:324:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and account for about 27% of our final IPO sample. 
13:319:26415:37:28:90:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure II documents the various characteristics of the industry IPO waves. In the first two 
13:320:26507:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sub-plots, we plot the number of IPO waves  and the  fraction of stocks in the sample  for all 
13:321:26602:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fama-French industries and all calendar years with IPO waves in our sample respectively. There 
13:322:26697:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are significant variations across both industries and years in terms of their representativeness in 
13:323:26797:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:our sample, but no single industry or year dominates our sample. In the next sub-plot, we present 
13:324:26895:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the histogram of the number of IPOs in our sample for 68 industry IPO waves. The minimum 
13:325:26984:28:27:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:number  of  IPOs  in  a  wave  is  8  as  required  for  forming  portfolios  within  a  wave,  and  the 
13:326:27089:27:28:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximum number of IPOs in a wave is 102. Most industry IPO waves (40 out of 68 waves) have

13:328:27228:8:16:72:532:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:11 We identify a total of 184 industry IPO waves using our wave identification procedure for all IPOs in SDC from 
13:329:27342:16:11:72:524:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:1970 to 2006. The statistics of these waves, such as IPO volume and duration, are very close to those reported in 
13:330:27456:11:0:72:352:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Chemmanur and He (2011). More details are available upon request.  
14:331:27526:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fewer than 16 IPOs included in our sample. In the final sub-plot, we present the histogram of the 
14:332:27624:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wave duration. Five industry IPO waves in our sample lasted for as short as 2 months, while one 
14:333:27720:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wave lasted for as long as 25 months. Most industry IPO waves (54 out of 68 waves) lasted for 
14:334:27814:27:38:72:502:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:Times New Roman:less than 1 year, with the most common wave duration of 6 months (14 out of 68 waves).

14:336:27922:27:38:72:197:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:III.A. Event-time analysis 
14:337:27948:38:28:90:542:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our analysis is first conducted in event time. In other words, we take a particular industry 
14:338:28041:28:27:72:543:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO wave at a time and trace the performance of this cohort of IPO firms over time. It is well 
14:339:28136:27:28:72:543:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:recognized in the literature that the statistical inference based on event-time analysis is fraught 
14:340:28236:28:27:72:542:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with difficulty and unreliability.12  Therefore in the next section (Section III.B) we will verify the 
14:341:28339:27:28:72:542:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistical  validity  of  our  conclusions  based  on  event  time  analysis by  using  calendar-time 
14:342:28442:28:38:72:120:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analysis.  
14:343:28453:38:27:90:543:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The year in which the industry IPO wave ended is denoted as event year 0.  At the end of 
14:344:28542:27:28:72:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:event year 3, we sort the remaining IPO firms in the wave first based on their book-to-market 
14:345:28636:28:27:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equity ratios (BM) into high-BM and low-BM portfolios. The BM is computed using the year-
14:346:28725:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end market capitalization and the book value for the most recent fiscal year that ends at least 
14:347:28821:28:28:72:543:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three  months  before.  Within  each  of  the  two  portfolios,  we  further  sort  the  firms  into  two 
14:348:28927:28:27:72:543:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolios based on their average gross margins (GM) during the fiscal years 1 and 2. We do not 
14:349:29023:27:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:use the GM in fiscal year 3 since such accounting information is not available yet at the end of 
14:350:29120:28:34:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:event year 3 for many firms when we form the portfolios. Once we construct the four portfolios, 
14:351:29216:34:7:216:219:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:

15:356:29670:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we then examine their buy-and-hold abnormal returns, in excess of the value-weighted industry 
15:357:29764:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio returns, over holding horizons ranging from one year (event year 4) to four years (event 
15:358:29863:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years 4 to 7). Stocks returns are value-weighted in each portfolio and proceeds from delisting are 
15:359:29962:27:38:72:238:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reinvested in the same portfolio.13 
15:360:29997:38:27:90:542:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table II reports the abnormal buy-and-hold returns for each of the four portfolios, averaged 
15:361:30090:27:28:72:542:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across all industry  IPO  waves.  The average returns and their t-statistics are computed  across 
15:362:30188:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different industry IPO waves using the number of IPOs at the end of event year 3 in each wave 
15:363:30282:28:27:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as  the  weight.  We  follow  the  approach  in  Jegadeesh  and  Karceski  (2009)  to  estimate  the  t-
15:364:30386:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistics  of  the  average  returns  from  the  time-series  of  event-time  portfolio  returns.  This 
15:365:30491:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:approach  allows  for  both  heteroskedasticity  and  correlations  in  long-horizon  buy-and-hold 
15:366:30590:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns  across event  firms,  and is  recommended  as  probably  “the most appropriate to  reduce 
15:367:30689:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:misspecification in tests of long-horizon event studies” by Kothari and Warner (2006) in their 
15:368:30784:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:survey paper. However, we call for caution in making inferences from these t-statistics because 
15:369:30880:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of  their  unknown  small  sample  distribution  and  lack  of  power  as  noted  in  Jegadeesh  and 
15:370:30981:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Karceski (2009). Finally, we will repeat our analysis in calendar time since inference based on 
15:371:31077:27:38:72:269:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:calendar time analysis is more robust. 14  
15:372:31119:38:27:90:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consistent with initial overvaluation, IPOs that achieved high valuation (low BM) at the end 
15:373:31212:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of event year 3 with low gross margin (low GM) underperform in the next four years relative to 
15:374:31307:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their industry benchmark. The cumulative underperformance from event year 4 to event year 7 is 
15:375:31402:28:21:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more than -30% with a t-value of -1.87. The underperformance is most pronounced during the 
15:376:31493:21:7:216:219:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
15:377:31541:7:16:72:532:136:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:13 We obtain the proceeds from delisting from CRSP monthly delisting file. If the delisting payment information is 
15:378:31656:16:12:72:518:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not available, for performance-related delisting (delisting code in 500-599), we assume a delisting return as the 
15:379:31770:12:11:72:535:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:average delisting return for all performance-related delistings of the listed exchange (NYSE/AMEX or NASDAQ), 
15:380:31880:11:12:72:530:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:following the recommendation in Shumway (1997) and Shumway and Warther (1999). For delistings due to other 
15:381:31987:12:7:72:471:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:reasons, we assume a zero delisting return when the delisting payment information is not available. 
15:382:32087:7:0:72:475:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:14 See Fama (1998), Mitchell and Stafford (2000), Schultz (2003) and Viswanathan and Wei (2008). 
16:383:32187:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:first year after portfolio formation (event year 4). It is more than -16% with a t-value of -2.28. In 
16:384:32289:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contrast,  low-BM-high-GM  stocks  do  not  underperform,  thus  driving  a  considerable  wedge 
16:385:32386:28:27:72:542:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between the future performances of these two portfolios of growth stocks. Table II also reports 
16:386:32482:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the stock performance of these two portfolios of growth stocks prior to the portfolio formation. 
16:387:32579:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Low-GM and High-GM growth stocks performed similarly both from the IPO date and from the 
16:388:32668:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end of event  year 0, suggesting that the market was treating them similarly during the initial 
16:389:32764:28:28:72:543:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years  after  IPO.  Since  the  number  of  firms  declines  as  we  increase  the  holding  period,  the 
16:390:32870:28:37:72:439:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:statistical reliability of these observations may be low for longer horizons.15 
16:391:32949:37:28:90:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:When  we  look  at  the  other  half  of  our  sample,  we  find  both  high-BM  portfolios  to 
16:392:33045:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:outperform the industry benchmark from even year 4 to event year 7. This outperformance is 
16:393:33136:27:28:72:542:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stronger  for  the  high-BM-low-GM  portfolio.  Importantly,  we  do  not  see  a  significant  wedge 
16:394:33238:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between the future performances of these two high-BM portfolios. Overall, event-time analysis 
16:395:33332:28:27:72:542:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suggests that only low-BM-low-GM IPO firms are associated with underperformance in the long 
16:396:33424:27:38:72:94:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:run. 
16:397:33429:38:27:90:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table III reports various portfolio-level characteristics of the four portfolios during the IPO 
16:398:33525:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Panel A) and during the formation period (Panel B). When we examine the IPO characteristics 
16:399:33618:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Panel A, we do not see much difference between the low-GM and high-GM growth stocks 
16:400:33705:27:19:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(see the last column for the significance test of differences). Green and Hwang (2012) document

16:402:33849:8:16:72:520:193:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:15 Occasionally, there are some extreme values associated with the buy-and-hold excess returns, especially over 
16:403:33961:16:11:72:506:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:longer horizons. For example, in the low-BM-high-GM group, AMGEN Inc. (exchange ticker: AMGN) and 
16:404:34059:11:12:72:522:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Surgical Care Affiliates Inc. (exchange ticker: SCAF) returned more than 14 times and 32 times over the 4-year 
16:405:34170:12:11:72:536:154:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:holding period. However, our results are robust to the winsorization of buy-and-hold returns on individual stocks at 
16:406:34287:11:12:72:520:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the top and bottom 1 percentile values within each BM/GM group. For example, the weighted average industry-
16:407:34394:12:11:72:531:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adjusted buy-and-hold return from the end of event year 3 to the end of event year 7 is -33.01% (t-stat = -1.79) for 
16:408:34511:11:12:72:535:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:low-   BM-low-GM stocks, 12.88% (t-stat = 0.68) for low-BM-high-GM stocks,  30.88% (t-stat = 1.19) for high-BM-
16:409:34622:12:11:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:low-GM stocks, and 29.07% (t-stat = 0.90) for high-BM-high-GM stocks. Finally, the point estimates change little if 
16:410:34738:11:12:72:535:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we further drop those penny stocks with the price below $1 at the time of portfolio formation, the end of event year 
16:411:34855:12:11:72:527:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3. For example, the point estimate of 4-year industry-adjusted buy-and-hold return remains almost identical, with 
16:412:34969:11:0:72:512:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:only changes in decimals, for all groups except for high-BM-high-GM group (Mean = 25.73%, t-stat = 0.85). 
17:413:35078:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that lottery-like payoff  associated with  an  IPO can contribute to  its  high first-day  return and 
17:414:35180:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:long-run  underperformance,  but  low-GM  and  high-GM  growth  stocks  have  similar  first-day 
17:415:35277:28:27:72:542:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns. Brav and Gompers (1997, 2003) find that IPOs underperforming in the long run are 
17:416:35367:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more  likely  not  backed  by  venture  capital  and  with  lockup  restrictions.  There  is  some  weak 
17:417:35472:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence that low-GM growth stocks are more likely to have lockup restrictions in place. The 
17:418:35565:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only  significant  difference,  however,  is  that  low-GM  growth  firms  sold  more  new  shares 
17:419:35664:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(primary shares) during the IPO than high-GM growth firms, though the average offer prices are 
17:420:35759:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not statistically different. This is consistent with the view that existing owners of the low-GM 
17:421:35856:27:28:72:543:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth firms are less optimistic about the future prospects of their firms and are willing to dilute 
17:422:35957:28:37:72:409:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their ownership more at the offer price (see Myers and Majluf, 1984). 
17:423:36027:37:28:90:542:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We then examine in Panel B price-related variables measured at the formation date (the end 
17:424:36118:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of event year 3) and other variables measured using information during the first three event years 
17:425:36217:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that is available at the formation date. Comparing the high-GM growth stocks to their low-GM 
17:426:36310:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:counterparts, the high-GM stocks not surprisingly are larger in terms of market capitalization but 
17:427:36409:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:do not have significantly lower BMs. By construction, they have higher gross margins, and since 
17:428:36505:27:28:72:542:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gross margins  are correlated with  profitability, they  also  have significantly higher returns on 
17:429:36605:28:37:72:406:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assets (ROA) in the first two fiscal years after the wave ending year.  
17:430:36677:37:28:90:542:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO firms in our sample in general have high sales growth rates (39%) during the first two 
17:431:36768:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fiscal years after the wave ending year. Among them, those classified as growth firms at the end 
17:432:36865:28:27:72:542:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of event year 3 are indeed associated with even higher sales growth rates in the first two years. 
17:433:36963:27:28:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Interestingly, low-GM and high-GM growth firms have similarly high initial sales growth rates 
17:434:37057:28:28:72:543:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(46% vs. 45%). These sales numbers help to make three observations: (1) an industry IPO wave 
17:435:37150:28:0:72:543:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contains similar firms in their initial growth stage of their life cycle; (2) market assigns high 
18:436:37251:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:valuations (low BMs) to firms with high sales growth rate on average; (3) IPO firms with low 
18:437:37344:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GMs are “rewarded” with the same high valuations (low BMs) as otherwise similar IPO firms 
18:438:37434:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with  high  GMs,  as  long  as  they  also  achieved  high  initial  sales  growth  rates.  All  three 
18:439:37537:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:observations  are  consistent  with  the  predictions  from  the  growth  equilibrium  under  bounded 
18:440:37639:28:37:72:262:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rationality in Aghion and Stein (2008). 
18:441:37679:37:38:75:221:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:Times New Roman: III.B.  Calendar-time analysis 
18:442:37709:38:28:90:543:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  repeat  our  analysis  using  calendar  time  methods  in  order  to  adequately  control  for 
18:443:37808:28:27:72:543:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differences in systematic risk exposures and endogeneity of the firms’ decisions to go public 
18:444:37902:27:38:72:385:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussed in Schultz (2003) and Viswanathan and Wei (2008).16  
18:445:37965:38:27:90:543:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in the event-time analysis, for a particular industry IPO wave, we sequentially sort stocks 
18:446:38060:27:28:72:543:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the wave into four groups at the end of event year 3, based on BM at that time first and then 
18:447:38157:28:28:72:543:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the average GM in the first two fiscal years after the wave ending year. Four value-weighted 
18:448:38250:28:27:72:543:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:BM/GM wave portfolios are formed within the wave and then held during the next four years.17 
18:449:38342:27:28:72:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In each calendar year t, we form the four composite BM/GM portfolios at the beginning of the 
18:450:38435:28:27:72:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year by aggregating the corresponding BM/GM wave portfolios across all industry IPO waves 
18:451:38525:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ending in the period year t-7 to year t-4 and using the number of surviving IPOs in an industry 
18:452:38621:28:28:72:543:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO wave at the end of event year 3 as the weight for BM/GM wave portfolios in that wave. The 
18:453:38715:28:27:72:543:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:four composite BM/GM portfolios are rebalanced at the beginning of every year t by adding 
18:454:38805:27:73:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks in  industry  IPO  waves  ending  in  year t-4 and dropping  stocks in industry  IPO waves 
18:455:38903:73:8:216:219:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
18:456:38951:8:16:72:502:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:16 Fama (1998) and Mitchell and Stafford (2000) also recommend the use of calendar portfolio approach to 
18:457:39056:16:7:72:538:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adequately control for systematic risk exposures and address econometric issues underlying long-run event studies.  
18:458:39172:7:0:72:452:78:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:17 In the case of delisting, the proceeds from delisting are reinvested in the affiliated portfolio.  
19:459:39277:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ending in  year t-8. We compute the monthly returns of these four portfolios in excess of the 
19:460:39371:28:37:72:295:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns on the industry benchmark portfolio.18 
19:461:39417:37:28:90:542:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  then  regress  the  monthly  excess  returns  on  the  Fama-French  three  factors  (MKTRF, 
19:462:39513:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:SMB, and HML) and the Carhart’s momentum factor (UMD). The three Fama-French factors 
19:463:39598:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:represent economy wide pervasive risk.  We use the Carhart factor in addition, to ensure that any 
19:464:39696:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mispricing  according  to  the  Fama-French  three  factor  model  is  not  due  to  the  well  known 
19:465:39798:28:28:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:momentum anomaly.  Panel A of Table IV reports the regression results for the four calendar-
19:466:39890:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time BM/GM double sorted portfolios. Confirming the results from event-time analysis, we find 
19:467:39984:27:28:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-BM-low-GM  stocks  to  significantly  underperform  their  industry  benchmarks  on  a  risk-
19:468:40081:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted basis during the four-year holding period by more than 1% per month with a t-value of 
19:469:40176:27:28:72:542:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.36. Interestingly, none of the other three portfolios is associated with abnormal returns after 
19:470:40274:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk adjustment. As a result, we see a significant risk-adjusted spread between the high-GM and 
19:471:40370:28:37:72:446:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-GM growth stocks, but not between high-GM and low-GM value stocks. 
19:472:40441:37:28:90:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As we follow Chemmanur and He (2011) to define IPO waves based on the full-sample IPO 
19:473:40527:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distribution,  our  calendar-time  portfolios  are  not  tradable  in  real  time.  Though  having  a 
19:474:40629:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:profitable trading strategy is not the main objective of our study, we also examine an alternative 
19:475:40728:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:approach to form portfolios using only the IPO information available at the time of portfolio 
19:476:40822:27:28:72:542:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:formation. Specifically, for each industry i and each year y, we define a month t in that year as an 
19:477:40923:28:83:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO hot  month if the number of  IPOs in  the 3-month window from t-1  to t+1  is  in  the top 
19:478:41018:83:8:216:219:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
19:479:41066:8:16:72:540:101:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:18 For BM/GM wave portfolios in an industry IPO wave, we use the returns on the value-weighted industry portfolio 
19:480:41180:16:11:72:530:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as the return benchmark. We use the same weighting scheme across industry IPO waves in forming the composite 
19:481:41289:11:0:72:515:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:BM/GM portfolios to aggregate corresponding industry benchmark returns for individual industry IPO waves. 
20:482:41398:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quartile among all months from 1970 to year y+3 with at least one IPO in industry i.19 We then 
20:483:41493:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:classify IPOs in those consecutive hot months for industry i as an industry IPO wave. We define 
20:484:41589:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the beginning month and the ending month of an industry IPO wave, for industry  i, as the first 
20:485:41685:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:month and the last month  with  at least  one IPO  in  an unbroken sequence of hot  months  for 
20:486:41781:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry i.  To  avoid  standalone  IPOs  being  erroneously  classified  as  a  wave,  we  require  a 
20:487:41884:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:minimum of 5 IPOs in total and 1 IPO every month on average in the wave period. Finally, once 
20:488:41978:28:28:72:543:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we identify an industry IPO wave ending in year y, we follow our baseline trading strategy to 
20:489:42072:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:form and hold portfolios of stocks in this newly-defined industry IPO wave at the end of year 
20:490:42166:27:28:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:y+3.20 The untablulated results are almost identical to those reported in Table IV. Only low-BM-
20:491:42262:28:27:72:543:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-GM stocks significantly underperform their industry benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis 
20:492:42354:27:28:72:543:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during the four-year holding period (alpha = -1% per month with a t-value of -4.11). Further, 
20:493:42448:28:28:72:543:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:there  is  a  significant  risk-adjusted  spread  between  the  high-GM  and  low-GM  growth  stocks 
20:494:42549:28:27:72:543:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(alpha = 0.83% per month with a t-value of 2.84), but not between high-GM and low-GM value 
20:495:42640:27:28:72:543:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks.  Since the results from our baseline portfolio construction do not seem to be driven by 
20:496:42736:28:37:72:524:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:any forward-looking bias, we continue to rely on the baseline strategy in the rest of the paper. 
20:497:42833:37:28:90:542:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Next  we  focus  on  IPO  firms  with  high  initial  valuation  and  low  gross  margins  that  are 
20:498:42934:28:28:72:542:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated with poor long-run performance.  In our first set of additional analyses, we conduct a 
20:499:43032:28:27:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:battery of robustness checks to examine whether our main finding is driven by specific time 
20:500:43124:27:28:72:543:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:periods or the specific way we form and hold our portfolios. We report our findings in Panel B of 
20:501:43222:28:19:72:552:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table IV. First, when we divide the time series of portfolio returns into  two halves: 1985-1997 
20:502:43319:19:8:216:219:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
20:503:43367:8:16:72:529:147:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:19 We require a minimum of 10-year data and a minimum of 12 months with IPOs to obtain the distribution of the 
20:504:43478:16:11:72:531:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:number of IPOs. We also exclude the December in year y+3 from the estimation of distribution to avoid the use of 
20:505:43591:11:7:72:235:120:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:IPO information in January of year y+4. 
20:506:43631:7:16:72:536:113:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:20 The only minor modification is that for industry IPO waves ending exactly in December, year y, we treat them as 
20:507:43746:16:12:72:529:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:ending in year y +1 and start to include stocks in these waves in portfolios since year y +5 to avoid the look-ahead 
20:508:43863:12:11:72:529:85:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:bias. Knowing these waves actually ending in year y requires the knowledge of January, year y +1 not being a hot 
20:509:43976:11:0:72:317:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:month, which requires the information of IPOs in year y +4.  
21:510:44040:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and 1998-2010, we find significant underperformance for the low-BM-low-GM IPOs in both 
21:511:44127:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sub-periods. The underperformance is slightly stronger in the first half (-1.14% with a t-value of 
21:512:44226:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:-3.33) than in the second half (-0.87% with a t-value of -2.59). This sub-period analysis further 
21:513:44324:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:confirms that our findings are not driven by a few big industry IPO waves. As is shown in figure 
21:514:44421:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:II.2, the second sub-period witnesses more industry IPO waves than the first one. Panel C of 
21:515:44514:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table I also shows that that the top five industry IPO waves in our sample all ended in years after 
21:516:44614:28:38:72:354:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1994 with the holding periods starting in years after 1998. 
21:517:44674:38:27:90:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second,  we  value  weight  all  stocks  both  within  and  across  waves  to  make  sure  that  our 
21:518:44775:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results are not driven by penny or micro-cap stocks and those thin waves with very few stocks. 
21:519:44870:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We continue to find a significant underperformance of low-BM-low-GM stocks relative to both 
21:520:44962:27:28:72:542:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their industry benchmarks and their low-BM-high-GM peers.21 Third, when we vary the holding 
21:521:45054:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:horizon from one year (event year 4) to seven years (event years 4 to 10), the underperformance 
21:522:45150:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of low-BM-low-GM stocks is significant in all holding horizons. For simplicity we only report 
21:523:45244:27:28:72:542:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the results of 1-year and 7-year holding horizons. The underperformance is stronger in the first 
21:524:45341:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year after portfolio formation. Fourth, when we change the portfolio formation date to the end of 
21:525:45439:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:event year 2 or 4, the results do not change significantly. Fifth, when we combine waves in the 
21:526:45535:28:28:72:543:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:same industry with a gap less than 6 months in between into one wave, this coarser definition of 
21:527:45632:28:27:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry IPO waves does not change our main finding.22 Finally, to make sure that our sorting 
21:528:45726:27:28:72:542:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variables  do  not  introduce  look-ahead  bias,  we  measure  the  book-to-market  equity  ratio 
21:529:45824:28:42:72:543:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:alternatively as the ratio of book equity at the end of fiscal year 2 to the market equity at the end 
21:530:45926:42:8:216:219:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                 
21:531:45974:8:16:72:515:124:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:21 When we weight all stocks equally both within and across waves, the alpha of low-BM-low-GM portfolio is 
21:532:46081:16:11:72:531:108:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:actually smaller (alpha = -0.61%, t-stat = -2.27), which provides further evidence that our results are not driven by 
21:533:46199:11:7:72:242:97:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:penny or micro-cap stocks or thin waves.  
21:534:46241:7:16:72:535:90:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:22 We also tried to combine waves with a shorter gap (3-month) or a longer gap (12-month). The underperformance 
21:535:46353:16:0:72:545:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is presented in both analyses, though further longer gaps produce less precise industry IPO waves and weaker results. 
22:536:46474:0:28:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of event year 3, and then form portfolios accordingly. The underperformance of low-BM-low-
22:537:46564:28:37:72:360:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM stocks is even stronger than that in our baseline case.    
22:538:46626:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  the  second  set  of  additional  analyses  reported  in  Panel  A  of  Table  V,  we  repeat  our 
22:539:46729:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio  formation  procedures  and  the  calendar-time  trading  strategies  but  base  on  firm 
22:540:46829:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:characteristics  other  than  BM  and  GM.  We  first  replace  GM  with  other  measures  related  to 
22:541:46932:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:profitability such as profit margin (PM), asset turnover (AT), gross-profit to-asset ratio (GPA), 
22:542:47030:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:return  on  assets  (ROA),  and  return  on  equity  (ROE).  Given  that  low  gross  margin  is  highly 
22:543:47135:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correlated with  low profitability, it is  not  surprising  that  low-BM-low-profitability firms  also 
22:544:47238:27:28:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:significantly  underperform  their  industry  benchmarks.  However,  when  we  examine  the  risk-
22:545:47336:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted return spreads between high- and low-profitability growth stocks, we find them to be 
22:546:47430:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:much smaller and less significant compared to that between high- and low-GM growth stocks. In 
22:547:47524:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other words, if we want to separate out future losers from their peers among the current growth 
22:548:47620:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO  firms,  the  recent  gross  margin  seems  to  be  a  better  predictor  than  other  measures  of 
22:549:47724:27:38:72:135:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:profitability. 
22:550:47739:38:27:90:542:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In a related paper, Novy-Marx (2012) shows that firms with high gross-profit-to-asset ratio 
22:551:47831:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(GPA) earn higher returns going forward, even after controlling for their book-to-market ratios. 
22:552:47928:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since GPA is the product of gross margin (GM) and asset turnover (AT), the results in Panel A 
22:553:48022:27:28:72:542:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:show that a lower GM, not a lower AT, is driving the future underperformance of firms that 
22:554:48113:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:initially  received  high  valuations  in  their  early  life-cycle  stage.  More  importantly,  our  paper 
22:555:48221:28:27:72:542:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differs from Novy-Marx (2012) in that we find average future returns on low-BM-low-   GM firms 
22:556:48316:27:28:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  be  even below  risk-free rates, but  positive  loadings  on the three Fama-French factors that 
22:557:48416:28:28:72:542:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capture economy wide pervasive risk. In the calendar time, the average excess return over the 
22:558:48510:28:0:72:547:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk-free rate during the 4-year holding period is -29 bps per month for the low-BM-low -GM 
23:559:48605:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio. Such a low return is difficult to reconcile with a positive risk premium for bearing 
23:560:48701:28:37:72:224:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy-wide systematic risk. 
23:561:48731:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Instead,  our  finding  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  that  low-margin-induced  high  sales 
23:562:48832:28:28:72:542:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth fuels higher initial valuation under investor bounded rationality as in Aghion and Stein 
23:563:48928:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2008), resulting in long-run underperformance. As a direct check, we conduct a sales growth / 
23:564:49023:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM double sort instead of the usual BM / GM double sort. As shown in the bottom of Table V 
23:565:49114:28:28:72:542:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Panel  A,  we  again  observe a  significant  future  underperformance  (from  event  years  4  to  7) 
23:566:49217:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:among stocks that experienced high sale growth but low gross margin during the first two fiscal 
23:567:49313:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years after event year 0. The underperformance is 78 bps per month with a t-value of -2.88. The 
23:568:49409:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:smaller magnitude in underperformance is to be expected since we did not control for market 
23:569:49501:27:38:72:203:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:valuation (BM) explicitly.  
23:570:49529:38:27:90:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our hypothesis posits that some firms, in the face of product market competition, are induced 
23:571:49623:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to sell their products at a lower margin in order to keep up the high sales growth rates. Naturally, 
23:572:49724:28:28:72:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:one  would  expect  to  see  a  bigger  effect  among  industries  with  more  intense  product  market 
23:573:49828:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:competition. We use two proxies for the degree of product market competition: Herfindahl index 
23:574:49923:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of sales and the advertisement intensity in an industry. Herfindahl index of sales is the sum of 
23:575:50020:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:squared market shares across all firms in an industry. Industries with a lower Herfindahl index of 
23:576:50119:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sales  are  generally  viewed  as  being  more  competitive  because  market  shares  are  less 
23:577:50215:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:concentrated.  Advertisement  intensity  is  measured  as  the  industry  total  advertising  expenses 
23:578:50318:28:27:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:scaled by the industry total sales. Industries with higher advertisement intensity are normally 
23:579:50414:27:0:72:489:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expected to be more competitive as their products are more likely to be homogeneous. 
24:580:50502:0:28:90:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In our third set of additional analyses, we partition all industry IPO waves in our sample into 
24:581:50598:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two groups based on the median value of the average industry competition measure in the first 
24:582:50692:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two fiscal years after the industry IPO wave ending year. Waves with above-median competition 
24:583:50786:27:28:72:542:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measures  are  classified  into  the  High-group.  For  each  of  the  two  competition  measures,  we 
24:584:50889:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:repeat the calendar-time portfolio analysis for the High- and Low-groups separately and report 
24:585:50984:27:28:72:542:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the results in Panel B of Table V. Indeed we find the magnitude of future underperformance of 
24:586:51078:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the low-BM-low-GM stocks to be much stronger in more competitive industries, as indicated by 
24:587:51171:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a  lower  Herfindahl  index  of  sales  and  a  higher  advertisement  intensity.  Further,  the 
24:588:51268:27:28:72:542:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underperformance  of  low-BM-low-GM  stocks  also  exists  among  industry  IPO  waves  in  less 
24:589:51365:28:37:72:333:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:competitive industries, albeit in a smaller magnitude.  
24:590:51421:37:28:90:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our hypothesis applies to a cohort of similar firms in the same initial growth stage that are 
24:591:51515:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:facing product market competition. Industry IPO wave is a particularly useful way to identify 
24:592:51609:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such firm cohorts since product market competition is one important driving force behind why 
24:593:51702:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these firms went public together in the first place (Chemmanur and He, 2011). As a result, we 
24:594:51796:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conjecture that if we do not condition our analysis on industry IPO waves, we should expect to 
24:595:51891:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:find weaker or no results. This is the fourth set of additional analyses whose results are reported 
24:596:51991:28:37:72:183:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Panel C of Table V. 
24:597:52014:37:28:90:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:If we define industry IPO waves by simply grouping IPOs in the same industry and the same 
24:598:52104:28:28:72:543:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:calendar year and repeat our portfolio formation procedures and calendar-time trading strategies, 
24:599:52202:28:27:72:542:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we find a much weaker underperformance among low-BM-low-GM stocks. Under such a pseudo 
24:600:52289:27:28:72:547:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry IPO wave definition, low-BM-low -GM IPO stocks underperform less than 30 bps per 
24:601:52379:28:28:72:543:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:month, a significant drop from 103 bps per month in the case where we use a more  precise 
24:602:52469:28:0:72:543:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:procedure to identify industry IPO waves (Table IV, Panel A). Moreover, when we repeat our 
25:603:52563:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio formation procedures and calendar-time trading strategies for all CRSP/COMPUSTAT 
25:604:52654:28:28:72:547:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks, the underperformance of low-BM-low -GM stocks becomes economically insignificant, at 
25:605:52747:28:37:72:191:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a mere 6 bps per month. 
25:606:52771:37:28:90:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Overall, using both event-time and calendar-time analyses, we find strong empirical support 
25:607:52863:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for  our  hypothesis  that  low-margin-induced  high  initial  sales  growth  fuels  optimism  among 
25:608:52964:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors, resulting in overpricing of some growth firms in the initial growth stage of their life 
25:609:53063:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cycle and leading to the long-run underperformance of these firms. We find that this key result is 
25:610:53162:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:robust to various modifications to our empirical design and that conditioning on industry IPO 
25:611:53256:27:38:72:397:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:waves is crucial to identify similar firms in an initial growth stage.

25:615:53555:28:38:72:330:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:could potentially explain the abnormal performance.

25:624:54241:16:0:72:223:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:produce qualitatively similar results.

26:627:54473:28:27:72:532:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM as the average gross margin in the first two fiscal years after the industry IPO wave ending

26:629:54666:28:27:72:528:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:an industry IPO wave on GM within each BM group at the end of event year 3. Our dependent 
26:630:54756:27:28:72:534:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variables are annual industry-adjusted stock returns in percentage points during event years 4 to 
26:631:54854:28:38:72:87:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:7.  
26:632:54857:38:27:90:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the first regression (Model 1), we control for annual stock characteristics such as size, BM, 
26:633:54954:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:past return, and turnover that have been shown to have predictive power about future returns in 
26:634:55050:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the literature. Size is measured as the log market capitalization at the end of the previous year, 
26:635:55149:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and BM is the ratio of book equity to market capitalization at the end of the previous year, where 
26:636:55248:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:book equity precedes the year end by at least 3 months. Turnover is the sum of monthly share 
26:637:55341:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:turnover in the previous year. We find a positive and significant coefficient on BMLow* GMHigh 
26:638:55435:27:28:72:547:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(7.62  with a t-value of 2.03), suggesting that among growth IPO stocks, those with a low gross 
26:639:55531:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:margin in the initial years after IPO subsequently underperform their high gross margin peers by 
26:640:55628:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:7.62% per annum in the period event years 4 to 7, consistent with our hypothesis. Interestingly, 
26:641:55725:28:28:72:542:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM has no predictive power among IPO firms with relatively high book-to-market equity ratios 
26:642:55818:28:27:72:542:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the initial years after IPOs, consistent with earlier results in both event-time and calendar-time 
26:643:55920:27:38:72:163:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolio analyses. 
26:644:55940:38:27:90:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the second regression (Model 2), we further control for a list of IPO characteristics that 
26:645:56034:27:28:72:543:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may predict long-run IPO performance, including the IPO first-day return, a dummy variable that 
26:646:56130:28:28:72:539:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equals 1 if the IPO has venture capital backing, a dummy variable that equals 1 if there is a lock-
26:647:56229:28:0:72:543:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:up condition, and the percent of primary (new) shares sold in the IPO. Consistent with Brav and 
27:648:56328:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gompers (2003), IPOs with lockup restrictions are associated with significantly lower long-run 
27:649:56423:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:excess returns. There is very weak evidence that IPOs backed by venture capital are associated 
27:650:56518:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with  better  long-run  performance,  which  is  also  consistent  with  Brav  and  Gompers  (1997) 
27:651:56618:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:although  the  coefficient  is  not  statistically  significant.  After  controlling  for  these  IPO 
27:652:56720:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:characteristics, the coefficient on BMLow*GMHigh is almost unchanged and still significant. To 
27:653:56815:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conclude, the panel regressions confirm that the underperformance of the low-BM-low-GM IPO 
27:654:56906:28:38:72:338:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms is significant both economically and statistically. 
27:655:56964:38:27:90:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  the  third  regression  (Model  3),  we  interact  the  BM  dummies  with  a  dummy  variable 
27:656:57062:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indicating  high  asset  turnover  (AT)  instead  of  GM.  Interestingly,  while  higher  AT  predicts 
27:657:57165:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher future performance, this predictive power is stronger among high-BM IPOs, although the 
27:658:57259:27:38:72:435:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regression coefficient on neither interaction term is statistically significant. 
27:659:57340:38:27:90:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Finally, in the fourth regression (Model 4), we interact the BM dummies with both high GM 
27:660:57430:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and high AT dummy variables. The regression highlights the differential roles played by GM and 
27:661:57525:28:28:72:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:AT. AT is  a significant  predictor of future performance among high-BM  IPOs.  This  relation 
27:662:57620:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:could be mechanical. To the extent that high-BM firms are associated with less growth options, 
27:663:57715:27:28:72:542:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the utilization rate of their current assets, as measured by AT, is a good indicator of their future 
27:664:57816:28:28:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cash flows. Holding valuation ratio (BM) constant, firms with higher ATs (thus higher future 
27:665:57909:28:37:72:398:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cash flows) should then be associated with higher expected returns. 
27:666:57977:37:28:90:542:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In contrast, lower GM is a stronger indicator of poor future performance among low-BM 
27:667:58063:28:27:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPOs. This result is unlikely to be mechanical. Untabulated results suggest that low-BM-low-GM 
27:668:58158:27:28:72:542:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks have future average raw returns close to or even below the risk-free rates. Such a low 
27:669:58252:28:0:72:543:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:average return is difficult to reconcile with a positive risk premium for bearing economy-wide 
28:670:58350:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:systematic risk. Instead, a low GM could be associated with a risky pricing strategy for gaining 
28:671:58447:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market share in the initial growth stage of a firm’s life cycle. Our findings thus suggest that the 
28:672:58547:28:37:72:445:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:Times New Roman:prices of such firms may reflect the unfulfilled optimistic views of investors.  
28:673:58627:37:38:247:367:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:IV. Additional analysis 
28:674:58650:38:27:90:543:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:So  far  we  have  provided  strong  evidence  supporting  the  prediction  of  Aghion  and  Stein 
28:675:58749:27:28:72:543:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2008) that low-GM firms in a growth equilibrium were initially overpriced and underperform in 
28:676:58844:28:28:72:543:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the long run. In this section, we investigate a comprehensive list of characteristics on these firms 
28:677:58945:28:27:72:543:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  their  high-GM  counterparts  over  time  since  IPO,  aiming  to  shed  further  light  on  the 
28:678:59047:27:28:72:543:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underlying economic mechanism that generated the initial overpricing. These analyses also help 
28:679:59142:28:37:72:352:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to rule out several alternative explanations for our results. 
28:680:59204:37:38:72:255:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:IV.A. Price sensitivity to sales growth 
28:681:59244:38:28:90:543:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A key ingredient to the growth equilibrium in Aghion and Stein (2008) is a market pricing 
28:682:59334:28:27:72:542:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rule that over-fixates on sales growth numbers. We provide direct supporting evidence for such a 
28:683:59431:27:28:72:543:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pricing rule by examining the market price response to surprises in earnings and sales growth. 
28:684:59526:28:38:72:491:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically, we run the following regressions following Anthony and Ramesh (1992): 
28:685:59610:38:39:383:539:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:                                               ,                       (2) 
28:686:59681:39:28:72:543:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where ExRetq is the quarterly industry-adjusted return over the 3-month period from the end of 
28:687:59776:28:27:72:543:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the first calendar month of quarter q to the end of the first calendar month of quarter q+1. ΔSGq 
28:688:59873:27:28:72:543:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the change in sales growth rate from calendar quarter q-1 to q, where the sales growth rate in 
28:689:59971:28:27:72:543:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quarter  q  is  calculated  as  (Salesq  -  Salesq-4)/  Salesq-4.  ΔIBq  is  the  year-over-year  change  in 
28:690:60080:27:0:72:543:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quarterly  earnings,  calculated  as  (IBq  -   IBq-4)/  MVq-4,  where  IBq  is  the  income  before 
29:691:60184:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:extraordinary items in quarter q and MVq is the market capitalization at the end of quarter q. 
29:692:60279:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ΔCAPXq is the year-over-year change in quarterly capital expenditure, calculated as (CAPXq - 
29:693:60372:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CAPXq-4)/  MVq-4,  where  CAPXq  is  the  capital  expenditure  in  quarter  q.  The  regression 
29:694:60469:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specification is for evaluating whether stock prices are responding to sales growth news after 
29:695:60564:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:controlling for earnings news and investment news. We run the regressions separately for each 
29:696:60658:27:28:72:542:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:BM/GM portfolio in each year during the 7 years after event year 0. Our hypothesis is that the 
29:697:60753:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:slope coefficient    should be positive and larger for low-BM-low-GM stocks when compared to 
29:698:60843:28:28:72:542:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-   BM-h igh-GM stocks in the initial years after IPO as the investors who follow those stocks 
29:699:60941:28:37:72:297:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are more likely to over-fixate on sales growth. 
29:700:60989:37:28:90:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In Table VII, we report these sales growth response coefficients, which are the regression 
29:701:61080:28:28:72:542:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coefficients on ΔSGq, and associated t-statistics. We also report the difference in the coefficients 
29:702:61181:28:27:72:543:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between high and low GM groups and the associated t-statistics. All t-statistics are calculated 
29:703:61277:27:28:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:based on the standard errors clustered by industry. To obtain the industry benchmark of the sales 
29:704:61375:28:27:72:543:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:response coefficient, we run similar regressions for a sample of all stocks in the industry which 
29:705:61473:27:38:72:479:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were listed at least 3 years before the ending year of the current industry IPO wave.  
29:706:61560:38:27:90:543:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consistent with the market’s over-fixation on sales, stock prices react significantly to sales 
29:707:61655:27:28:72:542:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth rates among all industry IPO wave stocks during the first two years after the wave ending 
29:708:61752:28:28:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year, even after controlling for contemporaneous earnings surprises. This is more so for the low-
29:709:61849:28:27:72:543:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM stocks. In the first year after the industry IPO wave, a 1% increase in quarterly sales growth 
29:710:61947:27:28:72:543:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate translates to 8 basis points in the quarterly stock return. Interestingly, after event year 3, the 
29:711:62051:28:28:72:543:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-GM stocks no longer have significant sales growth response coefficients, which is consistent 
29:712:62148:28:27:72:543:108:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the notion that the market starts to notice the overpricing among the low-GM stocks and the 
29:713:62245:27:0:72:258:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market price adjusts itself downward.  
30:714:62287:0:38:72:332:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:IV.B. Factors driving the long-run underperformance 
30:715:62339:38:27:90:543:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Aghion and Stein (2008) models investor bounded rationality by assuming that they follow a 
30:716:62430:27:28:72:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simple linear rule in forecasting future valuation relevant variables. Observing the initial high 
30:717:62528:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sales growth rates on the low-GM firms, investors might over-estimate the firm’s earnings power 
30:718:62624:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the future. This optimism is likely amplified by the two-way feedback mechanism between 
30:719:62715:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms’  strategies  and  the  market’s  pricing  rule,  causing  large  initial  overpricing.  Over  time, 
30:720:62822:28:28:72:542:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correction in these errors-in-expectation leads to long-run underperformance. In this subsection, 
30:721:62920:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we provide direct evidence for the initial investor optimism and detailed analysis of the price 
30:722:63016:27:38:72:166:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correction process. 
30:723:63036:38:27:90:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table VIII shows additional portfolio-level characteristics over years after the industry IPO 
30:724:63130:27:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wave ending  year for the high-GM and low-GM growth portfolios, their differences, and the 
30:725:63221:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:same  characteristics  for  the  industry  benchmark.  Panel  A  reports  the  post-formation  annual 
30:726:63323:27:28:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:frequencies for performance-related delisting. Consistent with the return results, low-BM-low-
30:727:63417:28:28:72:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:GM IPO firms experience significantly more delisting than their high-GM counterparts. More 
30:728:63508:28:27:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 18% of them were delisted by the end of event year 7 whereas less than 9% of the low-BM-
30:729:63601:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high-GM  firms  were  delisted  during  the  same  period,  confirming  that  growing  sales  at  the 
30:730:63703:28:38:72:360:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expense of profitability is indeed not a sustainable strategy. 
30:731:63766:38:27:90:542:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Firms may deliberately keep prices and GM low in the early stages of their life cycle with the 
30:732:63861:27:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expectation  that  it  will  help  them  gain  market  share  and  greater  future  profits  via  increased 
30:733:63969:28:27:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pricing power and/or permanent cost advantages arising from economies of scale. Our findings 
30:734:64062:27:28:72:549:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suggest that such expectations, if they were there to start with, were not fulfilled in our sample.   
30:735:64164:28:0:72:542:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In Panel B, when we examine the market share of low-BM-low-GM IPO firms, it only grows 
31:736:64254:0:28:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from 0.12 to 0.17 from event year 3 to 7. In contrast, the low-BM-high-GM IPO firms actually 
31:737:64347:28:28:72:542:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:grow their market share faster in the same period from 0.14 to 0.23. The lower market share, 
31:738:64440:28:27:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coupled with a low GM, not surprisingly leads to a subpar operating performance of low-BM-
31:739:64530:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-GM IPO firms. Return on assets (ROA) of low-BM-low-GM firms is significantly worse 
31:740:64617:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than  their  high-GM  peers  throughout  the  seven  event  years  after  the  IPO  wave  ending  year. 
31:741:64721:27:28:72:547:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Overall, evidence in Panels A and B suggests that low-BM-low -GM firms have deteriorating 
31:742:64811:28:28:72:542:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:operating performance in the long-run relative to low-BM-    high-GM firms, and investors who use 
31:743:64909:28:37:72:502:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simple linear extrapolation in forecasting, are likely to be too optimistic at the beginning. 
31:744:65003:37:28:90:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Stock returns are driven by revisions in future cash flow expectations rather the cash flow 
31:745:65095:28:27:72:543:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:realizations  themselves.  In  what  follows,  we  use  analyst  forecasts  to  examine  cash  flow 
31:746:65195:27:28:72:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:expectations for various horizons at the portfolio formation date (the end of event year 3) and 
31:747:65291:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trace the revisions in these forecasts over time from event year 3 to event year 7. This analysis 
31:748:65389:28:27:72:542:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provides additional  insights  on  the  exact  source  of  error-in-expectation  that  drives  the  initial 
31:749:65497:27:38:72:133:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:overpricing. 
31:750:65510:38:27:90:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Specifically, we proceed in the following steps to estimate the expectations of future cash 
31:751:65602:27:38:72:232:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:flows at the end of event year 3.  
31:752:65637:38:28:90:542:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the first step, we forecast future earnings of the value-weighted portfolio of all stocks in a 
31:753:65735:28:27:72:543:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:BM/GM portfolio in an industry IPO wave based on IBES forecasts of earnings and earnings 
31:754:65824:27:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth rate. The forecasted earnings for the first two years (event years 4 and 5) are taken from 
31:755:65922:28:27:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IBES consensus (mean) earnings forecasts. Earnings are then assumed to grow in the next three 
31:756:66016:27:28:72:543:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years (event years 6 to 8) at the IBES consensus (mean) long-term growth rate forecasts (LTG). 
31:757:66111:28:0:72:543:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We take the value-weighted average of LTGs of all stocks in a portfolio to form the portfolio's 
32:758:66210:0:28:72:547:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:LTG. Finally, earnings growth rate is assumed to converge linearly to a steady growth rate (SGR) 
32:759:66307:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the next 10 years (event years 9 to 18). We use the median value of all long-term earnings 
32:760:66401:28:37:72:345:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth rate forecasts in IBES as the steady growth rate.  
32:761:66459:37:28:90:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the second step, we forecast the book equity values in future years. We first assume a 
32:762:66549:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant dividend payout ratio (DPR) relative to the cum-dividend book equity value, i.e., Dt = 
32:763:66645:27:28:72:542:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(BEt- 1 + Et)*DPR, where Dt is the estimated dividend in year t, BEt- 1 is the estimated book equity 
32:764:66746:28:28:72:542:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:value in year t-1, and Et is the estimated earnings in year t. For simplicity, we assume a 5% value 
32:765:66846:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for DPR based on the historical average values of all firms in COMPUSTAT. We then calculate 
32:766:66938:27:38:72:536:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the forecasted book equity values assuming the clean surplus relation, i.e., BEt = BEt- 1 + Et -  Dt.  
32:767:67041:38:27:90:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the third step, we calculate the forecasted ROEs for all future years. Based on forecasted 
32:768:67135:27:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earnings  and  book  equity  values  in  the  next  15  years  (event  years  4  to  18),  we  calculate 
32:769:67240:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:forecasted ROEs in these years, FROEt = Et / BEt-1. Forecasted ROE for all years in the steady 
32:770:67335:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:state (SROE), i.e., those years after event year 18, is calculated as (1+SGR)/(1-DPR) - 1, based 
32:771:67432:28:38:72:474:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the equilibrium relationship among these parameters in the steady growth state.  
32:772:67516:38:29:90:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the final step, following Da and Warachka (2009), we form the future cash flow estimate 
32:773:67607:29:29:72:543:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as  the  discounted  sum  of  all  future  log  ROEs,       ∑                   .  Following 
32:774:67696:29:29:72:543:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Vuolteenaho (2002) and Campbell and Vuolneenaho (2004), we assume a constant value, 0.95, 
32:775:67786:29:28:72:542:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for , which is estimated from the historical values of market and book dividend yields of all 
32:776:67881:28:38:72:232:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stocks in CRSP/COMPUSTAT.  
32:777:67908:38:27:90:542:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:At the end of event  year 7, we update the cash flow estimate (ESUM) for each BM/GM 
32:778:67992:27:0:72:543:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:group in each industry IPO wave. Forecasted ROEs in event years 4 to 7 are replaced with the 
33:779:68088:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:realized values. For all other years after event year 7, the forecasted ROEs are updated, following 
33:780:68188:28:37:72:311:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the same forecasting procedure described above.  
33:781:68237:37:28:90:543:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We then compute the change in cash flow estimate (∆ESUM) from event year 3 to event year 
33:782:68326:28:28:72:543:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:7 for each BM/GM group in each industry IPO wave. Finally, we use the number of IPOs at the 
33:783:68418:28:27:72:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:end of event  year 3 in a wave to  weight across all  industry  IPO waves to estimate the final 
33:784:68514:27:29:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:statistics of each BM/GM group. We also break down ∆ESUM into three components: ∆ESUM4-
33:785:68601:29:27:72:543:532:8:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:7 which is due to errors in short-run forecasted ROEs of event years 4 to 7, ∆ESUM8- 12 which is 
33:786:68698:27:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:due to revision in medium-run forecasted ROEs of event years 8 to 12, and ∆ESUM13-inf which is 
33:787:68793:27:38:72:445:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:due to revision in long-run forecasted ROEs from event year 13 and beyond.  
33:788:68868:38:27:90:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The results are reported in Panel C of Table VIII. For each BM/GM portfolio, we report the 
33:789:68959:27:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:weighted mean and the t-statistics for ∆ESUMs. We also report the difference in the mean and 
33:790:69052:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the associated statistics  between high and low  GM groups  for ∆ESUMs.  We also  obtain the 
33:791:69145:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry benchmarks of ∆ESUMs in the following steps. First, for each industry IPO wave, we 
33:792:69237:28:28:72:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:select all stocks in the same industry as those in the wave which were listed at least 3 years 
33:793:69332:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:before event year 0 to form the value-weighted control portfolio. Second, we estimate ∆ESUMs 
33:794:69425:27:28:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for  each  wave  control  portfolio,  following  the  same  procedure  for  the  industry  IPO  wave 
33:795:69526:28:27:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:portfolios. Finally, we use the number of IPOs at the end of event year 3 in the corresponding 
33:796:69621:27:28:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry IPO wave to weight across all wave control portfolios to estimate the final statistics of 
33:797:69720:28:38:72:191:192:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the industry benchmark. 
33:798:69744:38:27:90:543:154:11:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: When we compare the low-GM firms to the high-GM firms in Panel C, we find that although 
33:799:69832:27:28:72:543:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:both groups experience downward revisions in cash flow expectations from event year 3 to event 
33:800:69927:28:0:72:543:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year 7, the downward revisions are larger (in absolute term) for low-GM firms. In other words, 
34:801:70025:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:low-GM  firms  experience  more  negative  cash  flow  news,  which  explains  their  relative 
34:802:70120:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underperformance. Most interestingly, when we look at different cash flow forecast horizons, we 
34:803:70216:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:find that the revisions in cash flow forecasts for the very long-run horizon (event year 13 and 
34:804:70312:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:onwards) are significantly more negative for the low-GM firms. This result suggests that the 
34:805:70405:28:27:72:543:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative initial overpricing of low-GM firms is likely a result of optimism associated with the 
34:806:70501:27:28:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm earnings power in the very long run. This result also partly explains why the overpricing 
34:807:70596:28:38:72:298:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:takes so long (almost 4 years) to be corrected.  
34:808:70645:38:37:72:209:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:IV.C. Uncertainty measures 
34:809:70672:37:28:72:543:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:   We  have  argued  that  industry  IPO  waves  are  a  great  setting  for  studying  the  growth 
34:810:70772:28:27:72:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equilibrium in Aghion and Stein (2008). IPO firms have short tracking records to offer but are 
34:811:70867:27:28:72:543:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated with high potential growth rates at the same time. Due to the resulting uncertainty 
34:812:70962:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated  with  their  future  earning  power,  investors  are  more  likely  to  over-fixate  on  sales 
34:813:71069:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:numbers in valuation at least initially, thus satisfying the key assumption in Aghion and Stein 
34:814:71165:28:38:72:110:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2008). 
34:815:71173:38:27:90:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To test this key assumption we first examine the cash flow uncertainty associated with IPO 
34:816:71264:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms using textual analysis of the Risk Factors sections of the IPO prospectus. According to 
34:817:71358:28:28:72:543:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Hanley and Hoberg (2010), “the Risk Factors section ... is the only section that has significant 
34:818:71455:28:27:72:543:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:loadings on both positive and negative tone. This is consistent with its role in describing the 
34:819:71551:27:28:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f2:second  moment  of  the  outcomes  (high  and  low), as its namesake suggests it should (pg 2857, 
34:820:71649:28:27:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:italics added).” Thus, more frequent occurrence of words related to “cost(s)” or “profitability” 
34:821:71746:27:28:72:542:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may signal higher expected cash flow uncertainty in the future. Loughran and McDonald (2011) 
34:822:71839:28:0:72:542:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carefully  construct  word  lists  that  are  particularly  powerful  in  financial  applications  and 
35:823:71945:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Loughran and McDonald (2013) update their lists for the IPO sample and show them to be useful 
35:824:72039:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in explaining IPO first-day return and subsequent volatilities. As we are focusing on measuring 
35:825:72135:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cash flow uncertainty within a specific section of IPO prospectuses, we do not use the more 
35:826:72227:27:38:72:377:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:general-purpose word lists in Loughran and McDonald (2013). 
35:827:72287:38:27:90:543:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  obtain  IPO  prospectuses  from  SEC  Edgar  for  stocks  in  industry  IPO  waves  with  an 
35:828:72384:27:28:72:543:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:offering date after 1994. For each IPO, we keep only the most recent filing during the window 
35:829:72478:28:28:72:543:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from 1095 days before the IPO filing date to 30 days after the IPO filing date. Panel A of Table 
35:830:72575:28:27:72:543:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IX reports preliminary results from the IPO prospectus for the four portfolios of industry IPO 
35:831:72670:27:28:72:543:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wave stocks. More than half of our sample stocks have valid IPO prospectus and associated Risk 
35:832:72765:28:37:72:507:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Factor sections. The coverage is similar across the four portfolios sorted on BM and GM.  
35:833:72855:37:28:90:564:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Overall, low-BM-low-   GM IPOs are indeed associated with more mentions of “Cost(s)” and 
35:834:72944:28:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“Profitability” in their Risk Factors sections.  While this is consistent with expected cash flow 
35:835:73042:27:28:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uncertainty  being  higher  among  these  IPOs,  we  need  to  keep  in  mind  the  limited  precision 
35:836:73145:28:28:72:543:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:associated with these findings due to the fact that we were able to examine the prospectuses for 
35:837:73242:28:27:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only  a  small  subset  of  the  IPOs.  Higher  cash  flow  uncertainty  could  lead  to  higher  return 
35:838:73347:27:28:72:542:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic volatility in the face of intense product market competition (see Irvine and Pontiff 
35:839:73446:28:28:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2009)), thus making it less attractive to risk-averse arbitrageurs to  arbitrage away the initial 
35:840:73545:28:37:72:144:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:overvaluation. 
35:841:73560:37:28:72:543:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:   We further examine two additional measures of uncertainty using the analyst forecasts and 
35:842:73653:28:27:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stock prices after the IPO. Diether, Malloy and Scherbina (2002) find that stocks with higher 
35:843:73747:27:28:72:543:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analyst forecast dispersion are likely to underperform in the future, compared with their peers 
35:844:73843:28:0:72:543:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with  lower  forecast  dispersion.  They  interpret  their  results  as  consistent  with  the  argument 
36:845:73951:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:proposed  in  Miller  (1977)  that  higher  difference-of-opinion,  combined  with  short-sales 
36:846:74047:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constraints, could lead to temporary overvaluation. In light of the recent finding in Cheong and 
36:847:74144:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Thomas  (2011)  that  analyst  forecast  dispersion  does  not  vary  with  scale,  we  measure  the 
36:848:74245:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dispersion as the standard deviation of analyst forecasts of current fiscal year's earnings per share 
36:849:74347:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as reported by IBES. In Panel B of Table IX, we report the statistics on the measure of analyst 
36:850:74443:27:28:72:546:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earnings  forecast  dispersion.  Low-BM-low -GM  IPO  firms  are  consistently  associated  with 
36:851:74540:28:28:72:543:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:greater dispersion  in  their earnings  forecasts, especially during the  early  years after the  IPO, 
36:852:74643:28:27:72:543:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which is consistent with the notion that the significant degree of uncertainty concerning these 
36:853:74739:27:28:72:543:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth firms could acerbate the initial overvaluation for firms pursuing unsustainable business 
36:854:74835:28:37:72:123:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strategies. 
36:855:74847:37:28:90:543:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  also  report  the  idiosyncratic  volatility  of  firms  in  Panel  B.  To  estimate  a  firm's 
36:856:74947:28:28:72:543:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic  volatility  in  year  t,  following  Ang,  Hodrick,  Xing  and  Zhang  (2006),  we  first 
36:857:75052:28:27:72:543:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regress its daily stock returns in year t on Fama-French three factors (MKTRF, SMB and HML) 
36:858:75144:27:28:72:543:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  Carhart's  momentum  factor  (UMD),  and  then  calculate  the  standard  deviation  of  the 
36:859:75242:28:27:72:543:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:residuals. To mitigate the skewness in the distribution, we take the natural log of the estimated 
36:860:75340:27:28:72:543:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic  volatility.  Overall,  low-GM  growth  firms  are  associated  with  much  higher 
36:861:75437:28:28:72:543:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic volatilities and these volatilities gradually decline over time after the IPO. Pastor 
36:862:75537:28:27:72:543:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Veronesi (2003) argue that the uncertainty associated with the IPO firms could result in high 
36:863:75635:27:28:72:543:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:initial  valuation  and  the  subsequent  learning  about  profitability  reduces  the  uncertainty  and 
36:864:75740:28:27:72:543:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:valuation,  explaining  the  IPO  long-run  underperformance.  While  such  a  learning  mechanism 
36:865:75839:27:28:72:543:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:could be consistent with the long-run underperformance of IPOs as a group, it should not drive

37:874:76589:28:27:72:543:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IPO  stocks  are  held  significantly  less  by  insiders  and  mutual  funds  (including  those  with  a 
37:875:76695:27:28:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:growth-style) when compared to their high-GM peers, especially during earlier years.25 The low-
37:876:76790:28:27:72:543:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:BM-low-GM growth IPO firms seem to have developed a clientele for relatively  more naïve 
37:877:76879:27:38:72:435:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investors who are more likely to suffer from over-reliance on sales growth.

37:880:77154:27:28:72:543:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constraints and high idiosyncratic risk, may explain why it takes three to four years for the initial 
37:881:77256:28:27:72:543:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over-valuation to disappear. Our findings are consistent with Stambaugh, Yu and Yuan (2012) 
37:882:77348:27:28:72:543:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:who find that asset pricing anomalies are generally stronger following high levels of investor 
37:883:77443:28:28:72:542:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sentiment, and in long-short strategies that exploit anomalies, the short leg of the strategies is 
37:884:77542:28:38:72:318:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:more profitable following high investor sentiment.

37:889:77815:7:16:72:509:124:6:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:25 We obtain the holdings of corporate insiders via Thomson Reuters Insiders Filing database and include the

38:895:78363:41:28:90:543:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The predictability of stock returns based on valuation ratios, like E/P, P/B, and C/P etc., is 
38:896:78458:28:27:72:543:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:well documented in the literature.  In a recent paper, Novy-Marx (2012) shows that firms with 
38:897:78552:27:28:72:542:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high gross-profit-to-asset ratio (GPA) earn higher returns going forward, even after controlling 
38:898:78649:28:27:72:542:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for their book-to-market equity ratios. However the debate as to whether such predictability is 
38:899:78745:27:28:72:543:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence  against  market  efficiency  in  economically  important  ways  has  been  the  subject  of 
38:900:78847:28:28:72:543:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:continuing debate. Investors may well be aware of such predictability and still agree with the 
38:901:78942:28:27:72:543:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market that the prices are right; the higher than average predicted returns on some stocks may be 
38:902:79040:27:28:72:543:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compensation for risks that investors care about and may be difficult to identify using historical 
38:903:79139:28:41:72:101:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data.  
38:904:79146:41:28:90:543:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The papers in the more recent literature support the view that some (could be a small part) of 
38:905:79241:28:28:72:543:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the predictability may reflect psychological biases built into the way investors make decisions, 
38:906:79338:28:27:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and agency issues limit the ability of more sophisticated arbitrageurs who have to rely on other 
38:907:79435:27:28:72:543:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:people’s  money  from  exploiting  any  profit  opportunities  that  may  arise  from  such 
38:908:79527:28:27:72:543:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:predictability.  Our findings contribute to this literature by identifying situations when prices of 
38:909:79628:27:28:72:542:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some stocks are likely to be affected by bounded rationality or biases in the way investors make 
38:910:79725:28:42:72:123:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decisions. 
38:911:79736:42:27:90:543:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our findings support the hypothesis in Aghion and Stein (2008) that there are time periods 
38:912:79827:27:28:72:543:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:when market conditions are more favorable to growth firms, and during those times firms with 
38:913:79920:28:27:72:543:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strong growth but weak margins will be overvalued. Taking advantage of industry IPO waves as 
38:914:80013:27:28:72:543:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a natural setting for studying a homogenous group of firms in the same growth stage of their life 
38:915:80111:28:0:72:543:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cycles,  we  find  that  among  firms  that  went  public  during  an  industry  IPO  wave,  those  with 
39:916:80219:0:28:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively high valuations and historical sales growth rates, but low gross margins during the first 
39:917:80320:28:28:72:543:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three years after the wave under-perform their industry peers by more than 1% per month during 
39:918:80415:28:27:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the subsequent four-year period, after adjusting for risk differentials. Greater uncertainties and 
39:919:80514:27:28:72:543:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lower ownership by sophisticated, better informed investors associated with these firms, in the 
39:920:80610:28:27:72:542:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:presence  of  limits-to-arbitrage  such  as  direct  or  indirect  short-selling  constraints  and  high 
39:921:80715:27:0:72:543:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic risk, may explain why it takes so long for the initial over-valuation to disappear.

43:1058:90151:13:13:72:723:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We follow the procedure in Chemmanur and He (2011) to identify industry IPO waves based on how clustered the IPOs are in an industry. For 
43:1059:90289:13:13:72:722:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each industry IPO wave, the calendar year in which the wave ended is denoted as event year 0. We form portfolios within the wave at the end of 
43:1060:90432:13:12:72:723:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:event year 3, based on the book-to-market equity ratio (market price at the end of event year 3 and book equity preceding the market price by at

43:1062:90720:13:13:72:723:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information is not yet available at the end of event year 3 for many firms when we form the portfolios. In addition, we require at least 8 firms in an

46:1190:93398:12:13:72:723:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note: This table presents the descriptive statistics of industry IPO waves. We define industry IPO waves by Fama-French 49 industries based on 
46:1191:93541:13:13:72:723:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:how clustered the IPOs are in an industry. For each industry i and month t, we count the number of IPOs in the 3-month window from t-1 to t+1. 
46:1192:93684:13:12:72:723:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then define a hot IPO month as a month with the 3-month number of IPOs in the top quartile of all IPO months from 1970 to 2010 in the 
46:1193:93821:12:13:72:723:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry. Finally, we classify IPOs in those consecutive hot months as a wave. We define the beginning month and the ending month of a wave as 
46:1194:93964:13:13:72:723:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the first month and the last month with IPOs in that wave. To avoid the problem that standalone IPOs are erroneously classified as a wave, we 
46:1195:94106:13:12:72:723:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:require a minimum of 5  IPOs in total and 1 IPO every  month  on average in the wave period. Our empirical analyses involve forming four 
46:1196:94243:12:13:72:723:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:portfolios within each industry IPO wave three years after the wave ending year (event year 0), based on the book-to-market equity ratio at the end 
46:1197:94391:13:12:72:723:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of event year 3 and the average profitability in the first two fiscal years after event year 0. We require a minimum of 8 IPOs with non-missing 
46:1198:94535:12:13:72:723:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sorting variables at the portfolio formation time for a meaningful sort. After imposing these filters, 1425 IPOs going public during 68 industry IPO 
46:1199:94684:13:13:72:300:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:waves in the period 1980 to 2006 enter our sample. 
46:1200:94735:13:12:90:725:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel A presents the distribution of IPOs on and off waves during our sample period. Columns 2-4 present the distribution for all IPOs in SDC,

46:1202:95022:13:13:72:722:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:appearing in COMPUSTAT within 3 years after the listing year. And the final column presents the number of IPOs in our sample. Panel B 
46:1203:95156:13:12:72:723:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presents the distribution of 68 industry IPO waves in our sample across Fama   -French 49 industries, and the  summary statistics for some wave

47:1259:96514:12:13:90:525:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stocks in industry IPO waves in 7 years after the wave ending year (denoted as event year 0). For 
47:1260:96612:13:13:90:524:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each industry IPO wave, we conduct a two-by-two sequential sort for IPOs in the wave on the 
47:1261:96704:13:12:90:524:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:book-to-market equity ratio (BM) at the end of event year 3 and the average gross margin (GM) 
47:1262:96798:12:13:90:525:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in fiscal years 1 and 2. Four event-time BM-GM portfolios are formed across all industry IPO 
47:1263:96891:13:13:90:525:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:waves. We first calculate buy-and-hold returns for each IPO stock in both the portfolio formation 
47:1264:96989:13:12:90:525:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:period and the portfolio holding period, then calculate the value-weighted average returns within 
47:1265:97087:12:13:90:525:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a  wave,  and  finally  obtain  the  wave-size-weighted  average  returns  across  all  waves.  For 
47:1266:97187:13:12:90:524:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consistency of comparison, we use the market capitalization of individual stocks and the number 
47:1267:97283:12:13:90:525:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of IPOs in a wave at the time of portfolio formation, the end of event year 3, as weights for 
47:1268:97377:13:13:90:525:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual  stocks  and  waves  respectively.  The  industry  adjusted  buy-and-hold  returns  are 
47:1269:97476:13:12:90:525:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculated  as  the  buy-and-hold  returns  in  excess  of  the  buy-and-hold  value-weighted  average 
47:1270:97579:12:13:90:525:209:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry  returns  over  the corresponding  horizon.  We  report the average  returns  (%)  and  their

51:1437:102267:13:13:90:525:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stocks in industry IPO waves in the holding period, event years 4 to 7, after the wave ending year 
51:1438:102366:13:12:90:525:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(event year 0). For each industry IPO wave, at the end of event year 3, we do a two-by-two 
51:1439:102457:12:13:90:524:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sequential sort for IPOs in the wave on the book-to-market equity ratio (BM) at that time and the

51:1441:102648:13:12:90:525:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsequent four years. In each calendar year t, four calendar-time BM-GM portfolios are formed 
51:1442:102743:12:13:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the beginning of the year across all industry IPO waves ending in years t-7 to t-4. Within each 
51:1443:102842:13:13:90:525:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:BM-GM portfolio, stocks in the same industry IPO wave are value-weighted first to form the 
51:1444:102933:13:12:90:524:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wave portfolio, and then wave portfolios are weighted by the number of IPOs at the end of event 
51:1445:103029:12:13:90:524:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year 3 for all waves entering into the trading strategy. The portfolios are rebalanced annually at 
51:1446:103128:13:13:90:212:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the beginning of each year. 
51:1447:103156:13:12:108:525:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In panel A, we report the average monthly industry-adjusted returns, the slope coefficients

51:1457:104122:13:13:90:525:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fiscal years 1 to 3; 5) combining those waves in the same industry with a gap less than 6 months 
51:1458:104219:13:12:90:524:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in between to form a bigger wave, and then forming portfolios based on our baseline trading 
51:1459:104311:12:13:90:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy with the re-defined waves; and 6) measuring BM alternatively as the ratio of book equity 
51:1460:104409:13:14:90:412:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the end of fiscal year 2 to the market equity at the end of event year 3.

53:1505:106008:13:12:90:524:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:portfolios of growth stocks among our industry IPO wave sample based on alternative sorting 
53:1506:106100:12:13:90:525:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables. The first five sub-panels present the results of two-by-two sequential sorts on BM at the 
53:1507:106201:13:13:90:524:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:end of event year 3 and the average value of other operating performance measures, such as profit 
53:1508:106299:13:12:90:525:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:margin (PM), asset turnover (AT), gross-profit-to-asset (GPA), return on assets (ROA) and return

53:1510:106493:13:13:90:524:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sequential sort on the average sales growth rate and the average gross margin in fiscal years 1 and 
53:1511:106593:13:12:90:525:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2. Similar to our baseline trading strategy, all these trading strategies form portfolios at the end of 
53:1512:106697:12:13:90:331:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:event year 3 and hold them during the next four years. 
53:1513:106752:13:13:108:524:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  panel  B,  we  partition  the  industry  IPO  waves  into  two  groups  based  on  competition 
53:1514:106851:13:12:90:525:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures of their affiliated industries. For each selected industry competition variable, we take 
53:1515:106949:12:13:90:524:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the average value of the variable in the first two fiscal years after event year 0 as the proxy of 
53:1516:107048:13:13:90:525:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry competition. The High-group (Low-group) refers to industry IPO waves with the value 
53:1517:107141:13:12:90:525:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the industry competition measure above (below) the median value of the measure across all 
53:1518:107234:12:13:90:525:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:waves  in  our  sample.  We  then  form  BM-GM  portfolios  separately  among  IPOs  in  these  two 
53:1519:107334:13:13:90:524:507:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups of industry IPO waves, following the method in our baseline trading strategy. Herfindahl 
53:1520:107430:13:12:90:524:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index of sales is the sum of squared market shares across all firms in an industry. Advertisement 
53:1521:107528:12:13:90:520:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intensity is measured as the industry total advertising expenses scaled by the industry total sales.  
53:1522:107630:13:12:108:525:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Panel C, we form BM-GM portfolios among non-IPO-wave samples, following methods 
53:1523:107713:12:13:90:525:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar  to  that  in  the  baseline  trading  strategy  on  our  IPO  wave  sample.  The  first  sub-panel 
53:1524:107821:13:13:90:524:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presents the results of forming portfolios among all IPOs in the same industry which were listed 
53:1525:107918:13:12:90:525:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the same year. First, IPOs in an industry-year IPO cohort are assigned into four groups at the 
53:1526:108016:12:13:90:525:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:end of the third year after the offering year based on a two-by-two sequential sort on the most 
53:1527:108112:13:13:90:524:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recent BM and the average GM in the first two fiscal years after the offering year. Then in each 
53:1528:108209:13:12:90:522:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calendar year t, we form four BM-GM portfolios at the beginning of the year across all industry-
53:1529:108305:12:13:90:524:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year IPO cohorts going public in years t-7 to year t-4. We first value-weight stocks within an 
53:1530:108400:13:13:90:525:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry-year IPO cohort to form cohort portfolios and then weight cohort portfolios across all 
53:1531:108496:13:12:90:524:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry-year IPO cohorts by the number of IPOs in each IPO cohort at the end of the third year 
53:1532:108592:12:13:90:525:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after the offering year. The portfolios are rebalanced annually at the beginning of each year. The 
53:1533:108691:13:13:90:525:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second  sub-panel  presents  the  results  of  forming  portfolios  among  all  stocks  in 
53:1534:108782:13:12:90:525:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CRSP/COMPUSTAT in the same industry. First, at the end of each year t, we do a two-by-two 
53:1535:108872:12:13:90:524:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sequential sort within each industry based on the most recent BM and the average GM in the 
53:1536:108963:13:13:90:522:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previous  two  fiscal  years. Then  we  form  four  BM-GM  portfolios  across  all  industries,  value-
53:1537:109066:13:12:90:524:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weighting  stocks  within  each  industry  to  form  industry  portfolios  and  weighting  industry 
53:1538:109166:12:13:90:524:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:portfolios  across  all  industries  by  the  number  of  stocks  in  each  industry,  and  hold  portfolios 
53:1539:109275:13:13:90:525:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during the next four years. Each month in the holding period, the overlapping BM-GM portfolios 
53:1540:109370:13:13:90:504:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formed in the previous four years are equally weighted to calculate the final portfolio returns.

58:1749:116588:13:12:108:524:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel A reports the fraction of stocks delisted due to poor performance, as indicated by the 
58:1750:116681:12:13:90:525:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:delisting  code  between  500  and  599  in  CRSP.  Panel  B  reports  the  operating  performance 
58:1751:116780:13:13:90:524:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures including market share and return on assets (ROA). A firm's market share in year t is 
58:1752:116875:13:12:90:524:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculated as its sales divided by the industry's total sales in year t. A firm's ROA in year t is 
58:1753:116974:12:13:90:524:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculated as its operating income after depreciation and amortization (OIADP) in year t divided 
58:1754:117071:13:12:90:525:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the average of total assets (AT) in years t and t-1. For each variable, we report its mean and 
58:1755:117169:12:13:90:525:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standard  deviation  for  low-GM  and  high-GM  growth  firms.  We  also  report  the  difference 
58:1756:117267:13:13:90:525:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between high and low GM groups and its t-statistics. We also report the industry benchmark for 
58:1757:117362:13:12:90:524:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each variable. For each industry IPO wave, we select those stocks in the industry which were 
58:1758:117455:12:13:90:525:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:listed at least 3 years before the ending year of the current industry IPO wave, and then take the 
58:1759:117554:13:13:90:524:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean value of a specific variable among these firms as the industry benchmark for stocks in the 
58:1760:117650:13:12:90:525:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wave. We then weight these industry benchmarks by the number of IPOs in the corresponding 
58:1761:117740:12:13:90:421:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry IPO waves, and report the weighted mean and standard deviation. 
58:1762:117813:13:13:108:524:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel C reports the summary statistics of the change in future cash flow forecasts from event 
58:1763:117907:13:12:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year  3 to  event  year 7.  For  each  BM/GM  group  of  stocks  in  an  industry  IPO  wave,  we first 
58:1764:118011:12:13:90:423:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forecast future cash flows at the end of event year 3 in the following steps.  
58:1765:118090:13:13:108:525:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the first step, we forecast future earnings of the value-weighted portfolio of all stocks in 
58:1766:118186:13:12:90:524:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the group based on IBES forecasts of earnings and earnings growth rate. The forecasted earnings 
58:1767:118282:12:13:90:524:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the first two years (event years 4 and 5) are taken from IBES consensus (mean) earnings 
58:1768:118374:13:13:90:525:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forecasts. Earnings are then assumed to grow in the next three years (event years 6 to 8) at the 
58:1769:118471:13:12:90:525:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:IBES  consensus  (mean)  long-term  growth  rate  forecasts  (LTG).  We  take  the  value-weighted 
58:1770:118570:12:13:90:524:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average of LTGs of all stocks in a portfolio to form the portfolio's LTG. Finally, earnings growth 
58:1771:118669:13:13:90:525:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate is assumed to converge linearly to a steady growth rate (SGR) in the next 10 years (event 
58:1772:118764:13:12:90:525:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:years 9 to 18). We use the median value of all long-term earnings growth rate forecasts in IBES 
58:1773:118860:12:13:90:208:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as the steady growth rate.  
58:1774:118888:13:12:108:525:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the second step, we forecast the book equity values in future years. We first assume a 
58:1775:118978:12:13:90:525:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constant dividend payout ratio (DPR) relative to the cum-dividend book equity value, i.e., Dt = 
58:1776:119074:13:13:90:525:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(BEt-1 + Et)*DPR, where Dt is the estimated dividend in year t, BEt-1 is the estimated book equity 
58:1777:119173:13:12:90:524:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value in year t-1, and Et is the estimated earnings in year t. For simplicity, we assume a 5% value 
58:1778:119273:12:13:90:525:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for DPR based on the historical average values of all firms in COMPUSTAT. We then calculate 
58:1779:119365:13:45:90:514:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the forecasted book equity values assuming the clean surplus relation, i.e., BEt = BEt-1 + Et - Dt.  
59:1780:119465:45:0:300:315:51:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:58 
59:1781:119468:0:13:108:524:710:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the third step, we calculate the forecasted ROEs for all future years. Based on forecasted 
59:1782:119562:13:13:90:525:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings and book equity values in the next 15 years (event years 4 to 18), we calculate forecasted 
59:1783:119662:13:12:90:524:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ROEs in these years, FROEt = Et / BEt-1. Forecasted ROE for all years in the steady state (SROE), 
59:1784:119759:12:13:90:525:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:i.e.,  those  years  after  event  year  18,  is  calculated  as  (1+SGR)/(1-DPR)-1,  based  on  the 
59:1785:119860:13:13:90:428:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equilibrium relationship among these parameters in the steady growth state.  
59:1786:119937:13:13:108:525:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the final step, following Da and Warachka (2009), we form the future cash flow estimate 
59:1787:120028:13:15:90:524:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as  the  discounted  sum  of  all  future  log  ROEs,        ∑                   .  Following 
59:1788:120118:15:13:90:524:618:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Vuolteenaho (2002) and Campbell and Vuolneenaho (2004), we assume a constant value, 0.95, 
59:1789:120208:13:13:90:480:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for , which is estimated from the historical values of market and book dividend yields.  
59:1790:120298:13:13:108:525:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the end of event year 7, we update the cash flow estimate (ESUM) for each BM/GM group 
59:1791:120387:13:12:90:524:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in each industry IPO wave. Forecasted ROEs in event years 4 to 7 are replaced with the realized 
59:1792:120483:12:13:90:524:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:values. For all other years after event year 7, the forecasted ROEs are updated, following the 
59:1793:120578:13:12:90:293:554:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same forecasting procedure described above.  
59:1794:120623:12:13:108:525:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then compute the change in cash flow estimate (∆ESUM) from event year 3 to event year 
59:1795:120712:13:13:90:524:529:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:7 for each BM/GM group in each industry IPO wave. Finally, we use the number of IPOs at the 
59:1796:120804:13:12:90:524:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:end  of  event  year  3  in  a wave  to  weight  across  all  industry  IPO  waves  to  estimate  the  final 
59:1797:120913:12:13:90:525:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistics of each BM/GM group. We also break down ∆ESUM into three components: ∆ESUM4-7 
59:1798:121001:13:13:90:525:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is due to errors in short-run forecasted ROEs of event years 4 to 7, ∆ESUM8-12 which is 
59:1799:121095:13:12:90:524:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to revision in medium-run forecasted ROEs of event years 8 to 12, and ∆ESUM13-inf which is 
59:1800:121190:12:13:90:415:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to revision in long-run forecasted ROEs of years after event year 13.  
59:1801:121265:13:13:108:525:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For each BM/GM portfolio, we report the weighted mean and the t-statistics for ∆ESUMs. 
59:1802:121352:13:12:90:525:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also report the difference between high and low GM groups and its t-statistics. We also obtain 
59:1803:121450:12:13:90:525:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the industry benchmarks of ∆ESUMs in the following steps. First, for each industry IPO wave, 
59:1804:121543:13:13:90:525:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we select all stocks in the same industry as those in the wave which were listed at least 3 years 
59:1805:121641:13:12:90:524:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before event year 0 to form the value-weighted control portfolio. Second, we estimate ∆ESUMs 
59:1806:121734:12:13:90:525:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  each  wave  control  portfolio,  following  the  same  procedure  for  the  industry  IPO  wave 
59:1807:121835:13:13:90:524:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:portfolios. Finally, we use the number of IPOs at the end of event year 3 in the corresponding 
59:1808:121930:13:12:90:524:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry IPO wave to weight across all wave control portfolios to estimate the final statistics of 
59:1809:122029:12:13:90:199:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the industry benchmark.

61:1933:124742:13:12:108:525:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel  B  reports  other  uncertainty  measures  including  the  dispersion  of  analyst  earnings 
61:1934:124841:12:13:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forecasts and idiosyncratic volatility by event years in the 7-year period after the wave ending 
61:1935:124938:13:12:90:525:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year (event year 0). The dispersion of analyst earnings forecasts for a firm in year t is measured as 
61:1936:125040:12:13:90:525:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the average value of the standard deviation of annual earnings per share forecasts reported in

62:1943:125606:13:13:90:525:697:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and its t-statistics. We also report the industry benchmark for each variable. For each industry 
62:1944:125703:13:12:90:524:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:IPO wave, we select those stocks in the industry which were listed at least 3 years before the 
62:1945:125798:12:13:90:525:672:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ending year of the current industry IPO wave, and then take the mean value of a specific variable 
62:1946:125896:13:13:90:524:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:among  these  firms  as  the  industry  benchmark  for  stocks  in  the  wave.  We  then  weight  these 
62:1947:126000:13:12:90:525:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industry benchmarks by the number of IPOs in the corresponding industry IPO waves, and report
