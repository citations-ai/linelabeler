3:58:1340:14:14:71:74:624:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
3:59:1340:14:14:71:537:610:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Physical resources such as land, labour and livestock, and nonphysical resources such 
3:60:1426:14:14:71:540:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:as indigenous knowledge and  institutions of producers in the grain surplus and deficit regions of 
3:61:1525:14:14:71:517:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the Central Highlands of Ethiopia are examined under situation of environmental and policy 
3:62:1616:14:14:71:523:568:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:risks. Frequency distribution and comparative statistical analysis of the grain-surplus regions  
3:63:1713:14:14:71:515:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:suggest that in situations where all producers are subjected to a common source of risk (e.g. 
3:64:1807:14:14:71:519:540:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rainfall): I) institutional resources become less effective, and ii) combination of land, labour, 
3:65:1905:14:14:71:527:526:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:knowledge and other complementary resources form the basis for adjustment mechanisms and 
3:66:1994:14:14:71:524:512:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sequential or strategic decisions. On the other hand, when essential resources such as land are 
3:67:2090:14:14:71:527:498:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:government owned and household decisions are shared by the state, local institutions or social 
3:68:2185:14:14:71:540:484:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:networks become an effective means to maintain reproduction of the farm and producers through 
3:69:2279:14:14:71:286:470:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:providing access to or sharing of resources.  
3:70:2325:14:14:71:74:456:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
3:71:2325:14:14:71:512:442:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: In the extreme case of environmental degradation (e.g., drought), farmers follow 
3:72:2406:14:13:71:515:428:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sequential decision-making. This sequence of decision-making begins with minimization of 
3:73:2495:13:14:71:532:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:expenditure, selling of resources that are intended to stabilize farm income, selling of resources 
3:74:2594:14:14:71:540:401:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:essential to farming and depletion of household items, and finally evacuation. The ability of such 
3:75:2693:14:14:71:531:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:farming system to regenerate, however, greatly depends not only on the availability of physical 
3:76:2789:14:14:71:522:373:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:resources but most importantly by the potential of knowledge and institutions of producers to 
3:77:2883:14:14:71:533:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:adjust to environmental changes, and support from governmental or non-governmental sources.

4:84:3104:14:14:71:74:652:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
4:85:3104:14:28:71:519:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The major cause of environmental or resource degradation is human activity. This 
4:86:3185:28:28:71:509:610:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:activity is greatly influenced by inappropriate government policies and increases in human 
4:87:3276:28:28:71:505:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:population. These factors coupled with climatic variability have contributed to severe and 
4:88:3367:28:28:71:539:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sometimes irreversible loss of resources, including humans in less developed countries (LDCs).   
4:89:3464:28:28:71:505:526:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Development experts have argued that sustainability of the environment can be 
4:90:3542:28:28:71:534:498:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:insured by targeting strategies to minimize the misuse of resources and ameliorate the effects of 
4:91:3640:28:28:71:517:470:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:inappropriate government policies. Strategies that were implemented in  this respect include 
4:92:3733:28:28:71:510:442:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:projects to increase food production because poverty and malnutrition are considered to be 
4:93:3824:28:28:71:491:414:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:factors contributing to resource degradation. Other strategies involve subsidies, grants, 
4:94:3914:28:27:71:519:386:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:preferential loans and bilateral agreements to relax stringent policies (Wilber, 1988; Schultz, 
4:95:4010:27:28:71:540:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1978, 1980; Hyden, 1986). Nonetheless,  projects that were intended to increase food production 
4:96:4106:28:28:71:519:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:have resulted in I) unequal distribution of wealth,  ii) changes in social organization within a 
4:97:4203:28:28:71:531:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:society, iii) eviction of small holders, iv) psychological damages by moving people to different 
4:98:4300:28:28:71:535:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:agro-ecological system, and  v) disturbed the agro-ecological balance (Chambers, 1983; Hyden, 
4:99:4394:28:28:71:529:247:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1986; Richards, 1985).  It is only recently that a multidisciplinary approach was adopted in the 
4:100:4491:28:28:71:480:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:design, implementation and assessment of development projects (Shaner et al. 1982; 
4:101:4574:28:0:71:330:191:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Dommen,1988; Richards, 1985; Warren et al.  1989). 
5:102:4626:0:28:72:537:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Adoption of multidisciplinary approach as a paradigm  may be challenged for reasons 
5:103:4710:28:28:72:518:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:such as cost-effectiveness, and requirements of  an in-depth knowledge regarding the social, 
5:104:4803:28:27:72:525:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:economic, cultural and environmental constraints facing the poor in LDCs. Most importantly, 
5:105:4895:27:28:72:516:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:however, the present study argues that the definition of resource as utilized by development 
5:106:4988:28:28:72:540:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:projects includes only those with physical attributes.  Such a definition can be viewed as narrow, 
5:107:5087:28:28:72:527:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and precludes the involvement of non-physical or social scientists in the evolution of practical 
5:108:5184:28:28:72:413:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:approaches to the design of environmentally sustainable development. 
5:109:5253:28:28:72:498:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The study in Ethiopia adopts a more general definition of resource. Misuse of 
5:110:5331:28:28:72:520:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:resources, environmental variability and inappropriate government policies are ubiquitous in 
5:111:5424:28:28:72:543:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:LDCs. Underlying these conditions, the study examines two issues. Firstly, the study investigates 
5:112:5522:28:28:72:508:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the importance of non-physical resources when I) rainfall and availability of resources are 
5:113:5614:28:28:72:529:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:uncertain, and  ii) producers are confronted with inappropriate government policies. Secondly, 
5:114:5709:28:28:72:525:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the study examines the manner in which households respond to drought caused by inadequate 
5:115:5799:28:28:72:460:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rainfall, shortages of physical resources and inappropriate government policies.

5:119:5881:14:28:72:142:261:144:Times:144:g_d0_f6:The Problem 
5:120:5892:28:28:71:504:233:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Several studies define resource as an entity that is characterized by its physical 
5:121:5975:28:28:71:518:205:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attributes (Tietenberg, 1988; Stevenson, 1991). The present study departs from these studies 
5:122:6068:28:28:72:466:177:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:because it relies on the following comprehensive working definition of resource:  
5:123:6150:28:14:122:540:149:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:" a source of supply, wealth, information or expertise, and ability to meet and handle a 
5:124:6239:14:14:122:352:135:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:situation."(Webster's college dictionary, 1991). 
5:125:6288:14:14:72:75:121:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
5:126:6288:14:0:72:526:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:According to this definition, resource refer not only to objects with physical but also with non-
6:127:6386:0:28:72:491:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:physical attributes. Examples of such resources that are examined in this study include 
6:128:6474:28:28:72:287:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:indigenous knowledge (IK) and institutions. 
6:129:6518:28:27:72:510:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Knowledge is the entire collection of meaningful-action oriented experience. IK 
6:130:6598:27:28:72:536:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:exhibits a sigmoid curve with increases in age, holding other factors such as schooling constant. 
6:131:6696:28:28:72:519:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This knowledge is often referred as "cultural traditions" because it co-evolved with the local 
6:132:6791:28:28:72:524:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:environment. While knowledge can be individuated, it also has a social character. Hence, one 
6:133:6884:28:28:72:521:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:can argue that IK is a social wealth, especially in organic societies (Weber, 1947; Durkheim, 
6:134:6978:28:28:72:110:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1947).1 
6:135:6985:28:28:72:538:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Experience is endless, so does is knowledge. As new ways of doing or undoing things 
6:136:7069:28:28:72:543:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:emerge, the old way is partly or totally replaced. The dynamics of adjustment in culture, farming, 
6:137:7168:28:28:72:531:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and agro-ecological environment lies within IK. IK is always in dynamic [dis]equilibrium with 
6:138:7262:28:28:72:429:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the environment and influenced by interventions from within and outside. 
6:139:7335:28:28:72:528:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Food production is possible through "rational" combination of knowledge, physical, 
6:140:7418:28:28:72:534:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:institutional and environmental factors. The processes of combining these factors determine the 
6:141:7514:28:28:72:535:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:chances of reproduction of the farming unit and producers. While mis-use of physical resources 
6:142:7609:28:28:72:535:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is identified as the major cause of environmental degradation, the importance of knowledge and

7:152:8456:28:28:72:542:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:household decision-making. These differences are reflected by the ability of producers to survive 
7:153:8554:28:27:72:366:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:under harsh environments and levels of production realized.  
7:154:8615:27:28:72:517:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:        Farmers comprise the majority of the population of LDCs. They depend on a system of 
7:155:8707:28:28:72:499:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:extended families and institutions to seek for help when there is a need. They are able to 
7:156:8798:28:28:72:522:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:maintain autonomy through the dynamics of what Hyden called "exit" option (Hyden, 1986). 
7:157:8887:28:28:72:507:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:These options help producers escape efforts of the state to impose policies on the system.  
7:158:8979:28:28:72:533:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The carrying capacity of the eco-system declines with losses of not only physical but 
7:159:9065:28:28:72:512:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:also non-physical resources (e.g. knowledge and institutions). When people are moved to a

7:163:9439:28:28:71:541:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sustainable development, therefore, investment should give equal emphasis to both physical (e.g. 
7:164:9536:28:28:71:304:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:land) and non-physical resources (Berry, 1988). 
7:165:9584:28:28:71:495:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Several studies have examined the response of producers to new intervention 
7:166:9660:28:28:71:532:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:strategies and their consequences under normal agro-ecological situations (Hayami and Ruttan,

7:168:9850:28:28:71:414:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(e.g., drought), the ability of producers to respond wisely deteriorates.

7:172:10075:19:14:72:522:128:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:power. This may probably lead to severe cognitive consequences. Such cases are observed in 
7:173:10166:14:14:72:513:114:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:situations where farmers are forced to resettle in different agro-ecological zones or become

8:182:10748:27:28:72:528:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Two studies were carried out in the central Ethiopian highlands. The first study was 
8:183:10833:28:28:71:534:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conducted in 1986/87 in the grain deficit districts of Ankober and Seladengay in northern Shoa, 
8:184:10929:28:28:71:526:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Ethiopia. The second study was carried out in 1990/91 in the grain surplus regions of Ada and 
8:185:11023:28:28:71:503:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Selale, northern and eastern Shoa province, Ethiopia. The study sites belong to the cereal-
8:186:11114:28:28:71:272:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:livestock or mixed farming system zone.  
8:187:11155:28:28:71:523:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Selale is representative of the high altitude zone (more than 2000 meters above sea 
8:188:11239:28:28:71:532:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:level) of the country. Ada represents the country's large middle-altitude cropping zone (1500 to 
8:189:11336:28:28:71:520:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:2000 meters above sea level). The major crops grown in these areas include oat, teff,  barley, 
8:190:11431:28:28:71:527:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wheat, chickpeas, horse beans and field peas. The average farm size is 3.1 and 2.6 hectares for 
8:191:11527:28:28:71:521:247:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Selale and Ada regions respectively (FINNIDA, 1989). Most households in the Selale region 
8:192:11617:28:28:71:528:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:belong to the Oromo ethnic group, while that of Ada farmers to the Amhara and Oromo ethnic 
8:193:11708:28:28:71:528:191:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:groups (Gryseels and Anderson, 1983; Belay, 1977). Farmers in the Selale region specialize in 
8:194:11802:28:28:71:539:163:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:livestock production while Ada farmers concentrate in crop production.  A sample of 217 and 54 
8:195:11897:28:28:71:529:135:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:farmers from Selale and Ada regions were systematically selected as a part of larger study (see 
8:196:11993:28:0:71:528:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Kebede, 1993). Frequency and percentage analysis of responses to open-ended questions were 
9:197:12085:0:28:72:389:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:performed to examine the importance of non-physical resources.3 
9:198:12148:28:28:72:527:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Seladengay is located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters above sea level while 
9:199:12232:28:27:72:540:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Ankober includes low-lying areas located at about 1800 meters above sea level. The major crops 
9:200:12327:27:28:72:539:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:grown include maize, wheat, teff, sorghum, beans, peas, chickpeas and barley. The average farm 
9:201:12422:28:28:72:539:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:size in Ankober and Selale regions is  1.03 and 1.25 hectares respectively (see Kebede, 1988). A 
9:202:12519:28:28:72:521:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sample of 80 farmers were randomly selected from drought affected areas of Seladengay and

9:218:13590:8:19:72:536:129:64:Helvetica:144:g_d0_f6:3      To assess and measure indigenous production knowledge, problem solving tests were 
9:219:13679:19:14:71:527:110:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:administered. The tests were intended to examine the kinds of solutions households provide to 
9:220:13773:14:0:71:364:96:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:crop and livestock production problems (see Kebede, 1993). 
10:221:13833:0:28:72:140:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mechanisms.  
10:222:13846:28:28:72:527:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: It has been pointed out that producers follow sequential decision-making process to 
10:223:13930:28:27:72:536:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the recurrent crises in the Ethiopian highlands (ILCA, 1986). The reaction length could be short 
10:224:14027:27:28:72:497:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:or long depending on the amount of wealth or asset holdings and related socioeconomic 
10:225:14113:28:28:72:498:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:characteristics of households. This study hypothesizes that decision-making patterns are 
10:226:14202:28:28:72:504:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sequential (see also Feder et al. 1985; W.Mariam, 1984). The sequential decision-making 
10:227:14290:28:28:72:540:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:process follows the sell out or eating of the final food stock, seed, different class of livestock and 
10:228:14393:28:28:72:513:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:assets before evacuation. Each time an asset is sold it is used to buy grain and its value will 
10:229:14489:28:28:72:497:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:influence  future decisions. Data regarding cropping patterns under situations of rainfall

13:296:18315:28:28:72:530:624:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:farmers of Selale and Ada regions, this pattern starts with reducing expenses, selling livestock, 
13:297:18413:28:27:72:523:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:search for off-farm work such as trade and wage labour, reducing consumption and selling of

19:455:28057:28:28:72:519:624:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Producers may be faced with crop failure when farming is rain-fed. In this kind of 
19:456:28140:28:28:72:544:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:farming system, production, consumption and other kinds of decisions depend on expectations of  
19:457:28236:28:28:72:506:568:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the amount and distribution of rainfall. Based on group discussion with the study farmers, 
19:458:28327:28:28:72:540:540:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:responses or expectations were classified into two: certain and uncertain rainfall. While there are 
19:459:28427:28:27:72:538:512:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:other categories of expectations, these two categories of expectations greatly influence decisions 
19:460:28526:27:28:72:530:485:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of farmers in the study area. Expectation of crop failures lead to adjustments such as saving on 
19:461:28623:28:28:72:496:457:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:current consumption and sale, changing cropping patterns and other strategic decisions.

19:466:29080:28:28:71:261:317:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and uncertain are presented in Table 7. 
19:467:29120:28:28:71:519:289:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Seladengay is an area with relatively stable rainfall pattern, where as Ankober has 
19:468:29204:28:28:71:534:261:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variable rainfall and intermittent drought. As a result, the number of plots in the low lying areas 
19:469:29304:28:28:71:530:233:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:when rainfall is uncertain is high for Ankober than for Seladengay (Table, 8). Low lying areas, 
19:470:29400:28:28:71:536:205:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:depending on the soil type, conserve moisture. Seladengay area doesn't not seem to have greater

21:531:31189:14:28:72:527:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: It is hypothesized that the older a farmer is the more asset and grain stock or wealth 
21:532:31276:28:27:72:535:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:he/she owns. The larger the family size, the larger the consuming units, and hence the lesser the 
21:533:31374:27:28:72:524:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:grain stock available as a security in case of drought. The more educated a farmer is the more 
21:534:31469:28:28:72:479:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:likely she/he anticipates the severity of drought and make decisions to save on grain 
21:535:31555:28:28:72:529:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:consumption and sale. Similarly, the more asset households posses at the time of marriage, the 
21:536:31650:28:28:72:540:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more likely that they will posses greater asset and grain stock at the time of drought than farmers 
21:537:31750:28:28:72:535:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:who are not married or posses few assets when married. The result of this study suggest that the 
21:538:31847:28:28:72:434:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of most of the variables conform to the above hypotheses (Table 9).  
21:539:31923:28:28:72:543:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The decision to sale sheep is expected to be negatively influenced by all variables. The 
21:540:32012:28:28:72:516:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reasons being that sheep are susceptible to water stress and lamb spoils quickly under warm 
21:541:32104:28:28:72:533:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:temperature even when preserved using traditional techniques. As a result, the price of sheep at 
21:542:32201:28:28:72:529:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:time of drought is extremely low. The choices or decision strategies are either to kill the sheep

23:587:36404:28:28:72:509:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:relatively higher price those who are older and educated would be more willing to sell and 
23:588:36495:28:27:72:350:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:purchase grain than consuming the meat of goat at home. 
23:589:36551:27:28:72:520:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The sale of donkey, mule and horse is expected to be positively correlated with all 
23:590:36635:28:28:72:541:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variables because they are mainly used as means of transport (Table 9). Since there are relatively 
23:591:36734:28:28:72:519:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:few items to be transported at time of drought, these animals are not needed at home. On the 
23:592:36827:28:28:72:523:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:other hand, people who want to evacuate may need these animals. The result suggest positive 
23:593:36919:28:28:72:531:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:association of all variables with the sale of draft animals except the sale of sheep and goat. The 
23:594:37018:28:28:72:541:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:higher the value of sheep and goat sold or the more the number of days the meat of these animals 
23:595:37115:28:28:72:535:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:feed the family, the less the demand for money to purchase food grain. Hence, households may  
23:596:37209:28:28:72:536:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decide to wait a little longer before selling draft animals. The less the price offered to sheep and 
23:597:37310:28:28:72:348:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goat, the more likely that farmers will sale draft animals. 
23:598:37370:28:28:72:502:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  Heifer or steer are important stock to start animal husbandry. In addition, farmers 
23:599:37456:28:28:72:529:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:associate cattle with their very existence. Losing cattle is, therefore, considered as losing one's 
23:600:37556:28:28:72:537:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:identity. Economically, it is these class of animals that are at the root of the theory of "exchange 
23:601:37657:28:28:72:534:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:entitlement" (Sen, 1984). The sale of this class of livestock represent half way in the severity of 
23:602:37757:28:28:72:537:247:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the drought, and these  animals don't with stand water and feed shortages. The sale of heifer and 
23:603:37855:28:28:72:533:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:steer is expected to be positively correlated with education, age, and family size, but negatively 
23:604:37954:28:28:72:534:191:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:affected by asset, grain stock and previous sale of animals. Households who are educated, older 
23:605:38050:28:28:72:535:163:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and support larger family size are more likely to  sale these animals rather than letting them die. 
23:606:38150:28:28:72:543:135:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:On the other hand, the more asset and grain stock households posses, the less likely that they will 
23:607:38250:28:0:72:528:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sale heifer and steer. As expected most variables exert statistically significant influence on the 
24:608:38351:0:28:72:506:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decision to sale steer or heifer (Table 10). Previous decisions negatively influence current 
24:609:38444:28:28:72:542:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decisions. That is, the more grain households can buy from previous sale, the less likely they will 
24:610:38544:28:27:72:211:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sale existing cattle or assets. 
24:611:38576:27:28:72:533:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  The sale of a cow and an ox represent critical stage in the life cycle of a farming system 
24:612:38669:28:28:72:504:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:undergoing crisis. Among farmers in the Ethiopian highlands, a cow is symbolized as the 
24:613:38757:28:28:72:525:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:"mother" of the farming system, of the self, and of children. That is, a cow or an ox serve as a 
24:614:38854:28:28:72:536:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:source and means of food production. Therefore, the sale of these animals represent the severity 
24:615:38951:28:28:72:524:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drought and households will be ready to evacuate. The sale of these animals is expected to be 
24:616:39045:28:28:72:517:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:influenced positively by all variables except by the preceding decision. Households who are 
24:617:39137:28:28:72:518:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:educated, older and support large family size are more likely to anticipate the severity of the 
24:618:39233:28:28:72:518:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drought and willing to sale these animals. The result support this hypothesis (Table 10). The 
24:619:39327:28:28:72:534:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:grain purchased from previous sales decisions except the sale of heifers/steer and cow is almost 
24:620:39424:28:28:72:521:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:used up. Thus, previous sales encourage the sale of existing animals or stock to replace grain 
24:621:39519:28:28:72:439:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stock or extend the length of time that households can stay in their village.   
24:622:39599:28:28:72:539:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  The decision sale of household equipments and remaining assets represent the final stage 
24:623:39690:28:28:72:542:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of liquidation. Most past decisions will have little impact on current decisions because food grain 
24:624:39790:28:28:72:536:247:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:purchased from the sale of sheep, goat, draft animals, steer and heifer is used-up. Thus, only the 
24:625:39889:28:28:72:502:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sale of cow and ox (recent decisions) are negatively and significantly associated with the 
24:626:39980:28:28:72:333:191:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decision to liquidate the remaining households assets. 
24:627:40035:28:28:72:472:163:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  Finally, it was hypothesized that producers decisions, even in a situation of 
24:628:40115:28:28:72:538:135:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:environmental crises, are sequential or recursive. The larger the income or grain purchased from 
24:629:40212:28:0:72:530:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:liquidation of assets, the more the number of days that households stay in their village, and the 
25:630:40312:0:28:72:535:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:less the need the sale or kill the next animal or household items. This hypothesis is supported in 
25:631:40411:28:28:72:164:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:Times:all the regressions. 
25:632:40431:28:28:72:75:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
25:633:40431:28:28:72:140:610:144:Times:144:g_d0_f6:Conclusions  
25:634:40443:28:28:72:517:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  When producers are subjected to a common source of risk (e.g. rainfall) institutional 
25:635:40531:28:27:72:526:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:resources become less effective and combination of physical and non-physical resources form 
25:636:40623:27:28:72:519:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the basis for adjustment mechanisms. When essential resources such as land are government 
25:637:40713:28:28:72:490:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:owned and household decisions are shared by the state (e.g. marketing of grain ), local 
25:638:40801:28:28:72:511:471:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:institutions become an effective means to maintain reproduction of the farm and producers 
25:639:40891:28:28:72:520:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:through providing access to or sharing of resources. Losses of resources are the result of mis-
25:640:40986:28:28:72:491:415:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:management or the outcome of knowledge-directed actions of decision makers and the 
25:641:41069:28:28:72:350:387:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:infrastructure that permits these actions (i.e. institutions). 
25:642:41132:28:28:72:507:359:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:        The result of empirical analysis of drought adjustment strategies indicate that I) 
25:643:41223:28:28:72:505:331:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:current food stock is negatively and significantly influenced by family size, ii) as drought 
25:644:41316:28:28:72:535:303:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:progress, decisions to sale different classes of livestock are positively influenced by age, family 
25:645:41416:28:28:72:533:275:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:size, education, grain stock and assets, and iii) current sale of livestock is negatively influenced 
25:646:41517:28:28:72:534:247:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:by previous sale. That is, the higher the value of livestock or asset sold, the less willing farmers 
25:647:41618:28:28:72:293:219:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are to sale the next class of livestock or asset. 
25:648:41668:28:28:72:524:191:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:  Unlike previous studies in peasant economies that relay on the importance of physical 
25:649:41756:28:28:72:520:163:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:resources as key variables contributing to increases in food production, the present study has 
25:650:41851:28:28:72:517:135:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:demonstrated the vital role that indigenous knowledge and institutions play both in resource 
25:651:41944:28:0:72:536:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:abundant and scare regions. The ability of humans to act and act wisely is shaped by knowledge 
26:652:42041:0:28:72:494:694:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and experience they posses. In turn, their actions are given meaning by the institutional 
26:653:42131:28:28:72:512:666:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:framework. Development in its broadest sense and avoidance of environmental or resource 
26:654:42219:28:27:72:522:638:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:degradation  can be attained if non-physical resources (knowledge and institutions) are given 
26:655:42313:27:28:72:521:611:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:appropriate consideration in the design and implementation of intervention strategies. Proper 
26:656:42407:28:28:72:479:583:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:analysis and integration of knowledge and institutions of peasants in the planning of 
26:657:42493:28:28:72:503:555:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:development strategies will help minimize misuse of resources, ensures increases in food 
26:658:42582:28:0:72:373:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:production and minimizes the danger of environmental crises.
