2:28:1430:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:This paper studies the nature and impact of credit constraints in the market for human capital. We
2:29:1528:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:derive endogenous constraints from the design of government student loan programs and from the
2:30:1622:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:limited repayment incentives in private lending markets. These constraints imply cross-sectional patterns
2:31:1727:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:for schooling, ability, and family income that are consistent with U.S. data. This contrasts with the
2:32:1828:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:standard exogenous constraint model, which predicts a counterfactual negative ability -- schooling
2:33:1926:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:relationship for low-income youth. We show that the rising empirical importance of familial wealth
2:34:2024:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:and income in determining college attendance (Belley and Lochner  2007) is consistent with increasingly
2:35:2127:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:binding credit constraints in the face of rising tuition costs and returns to schooling. Our framework
2:36:2229:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:also explains the recent increase in private credit for college as a market response to the rising returns
2:37:2335:14:42:72:119:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:to school.

3:52:2640:0:30:72:208:775:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:53:2655:30:18:72:540:745:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Borrowing constraints have a long history in the literature on schooling and human capital
3:54:2745:18:18:72:540:727:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment. Because human capital cannot be repossessed in response to default, it makes
3:55:2833:18:18:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for poor collateral. Since investing in human capital is most efficient when individuals are
3:56:2925:18:18:72:540:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:young, most students have not established a credit reputation or accumulated other forms
3:57:3013:18:18:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of collateral. As a result, private financial institutions have historically offered little credit
3:58:3111:18:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to finance higher education.1Even when governments have stepped in with public student
3:59:3197:18:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lending programs, the credit offered through these programs has been quite limited, and
3:60:3284:18:18:72:484:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit constraints may still play an important role in higher education decisions.
3:61:3366:18:18:89:539:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As pointed out by Becker (1975), youth with few family resources under-invest in their
3:62:3452:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:human capital if they cannot obtain adequate credit.  This observation has motivated a
3:63:3538:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:voluminous literature examining the relationship between family income (or wealth) and
3:64:3624:18:17:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:college attendance (e.g. Manski and Wise 1983, Cameron and Heckman 1998, 2001, Ellwood
3:65:3710:17:18:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Kane 2000, Carneiro and Heckman 2002, Belley and Lochner 2007). Using U.S. data
3:66:3793:18:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79
3:67:3876:18:18:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and NLSY97, respectively) and controlling for individual differences in ability and family
3:68:3966:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:background, Belley and Lochner (2007) estimate a weak family income – college attendance
3:69:4054:18:18:72:539:458:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:relationship in the early 1980s but a much stronger positive relationship in the early 2000s.2
3:70:4148:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This seems to suggest that borrowing constraints had little effect on schooling decisions in the
3:71:4244:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:early 1980s, but that their effects have grown more important in recent years. Consistent with
3:72:4338:18:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this hypothesis, recent U.S. Department of Education studies (Berkner 2000 and Titus 2002)
3:73:4428:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:report that the fraction of undergraduate student borrowers who borrowed the maximum
3:74:4512:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allowable amount from federal student loan programs nearly tripled from 18% in 1989-90
3:75:4598:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to 52% in 1999-2000. At the same time, however, student borrowing from private lending
3:76:4684:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:institutions increased from negligible amounts in the mid-1990s to $14 billion, almost 20%
3:77:4774:18:18:72:539:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:of all student loans distributed, in the 2004-05 academic year (College Board 2005).Ceteris
3:78:4865:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:paribus, this expansion in private lending should have helped alleviate the tight constraints
3:79:4958:18:17:72:351:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imposed by government student loan (GSL) programs.
3:80:5008:17:18:89:539:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We study these patterns of college attendance and borrowing in a human capital invest-
3:81:5094:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment model that incorporates limited borrowing opportunities from both GSL programs and
3:82:5181:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:private lenders. Our analysis suggests that all of these trends can be explained by the rising
3:83:5275:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:returns to schooling (Katz and Autor 1999, Heckman, Lochner and Todd 2008), rising costs
3:84:5363:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of attendance at U.S. colleges and universities (College Board 2006), and fairly stable real
3:85:5455:18:19:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing limits associated with GSL programs (Kane 2007) over the last few decades. As
3:86:5542:19:12:85:326:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:A:1This has changed in recent years, as we discuss below.
3:87:5597:12:15:85:539:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2Using a variety of empirical approaches and data from the NLSY79, a number of researchers have
3:88:5692:15:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:concluded that borrowing constraints had little effect on college-going behavior in the early 1980s. Ellwood
3:89:5800:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Kane (2000) also estimate that family income has become a more important determinant of college-going
3:90:5905:12:0:72:313:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:since 1980. See Section 3 for a review of this literature.
4:91:5964:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss further below, our model also implies cross-sectional correlations between ability
4:92:6057:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and investment that are more in line with U.S. data than does the traditional model with
4:93:6145:18:18:72:242:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exogenous borrowing constraints.
4:94:6177:18:18:89:539:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The human capital literature has paid little attention to the nature of borrowing con-
4:95:6263:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:straints. Existing models typically assume that either interest rates increase with the amount
4:96:6357:18:18:72:539:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowed or that there is a fixed maximum amount that individuals can borrow.3Both ap-
4:97:6443:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proaches neglect the link between borrowing opportunities and investment decisions that
4:98:6530:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plays a key role in both GSL programs and private lending as we describe below. We show
4:99:6617:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that without this link, the canonical model of exogenous borrowing constraints predicts
4:100:6704:18:18:72:539:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:anegativerelationship between ability and human capital investment among constrained
4:101:6788:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers when the consumption intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) is less than
4:102:6878:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one. This is troubling, since most empirical estimates of the IES are below one (Browning,
4:103:6968:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hansen, and Heckman 1999) and a strong positive ability – college attendance relationship
4:104:7057:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exists for all family income (or wealth) levels in both the NLSY79 and NLSY97 (as we show
4:105:7146:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 3). Additionally, models with exogenous borrowing constraints offer no insights
4:106:7236:17:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regarding the recent rise in private student lending, the interaction between private and pub-
4:107:7330:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lic lending, or how lending opportunities respond to important economic and policy changes.
4:108:7421:18:18:72:335:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our framework offers insights on all of these issues.
4:109:7474:18:18:89:539:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:GSL programs directly tie student credit to the level of investment — students can
4:110:7556:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrow to help finance college-related expenses only if they are enrolled in school. We show
4:111:7648:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that private lenders, facing limited repayment incentives from borrowers, will also link credit
4:112:7743:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limits to the level of investment, as well as observable individual characteristics that affect the
4:113:7842:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:returns to investment. These features of endogenously determined (or variable) borrowing
4:114:7930:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limits help generate a positive relationship between ability and investment (even when the
4:115:8020:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:IES is less than one) while still predicting a positive relationship between family resources
4:116:8113:18:18:72:290:326:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:and investment among constrained youth.4
4:117:8153:18:18:89:539:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:GSL programs have two distinct forms of limits: (i) a pre-specified maximum loan limit
4:118:8239:18:18:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(denote this bydmax), and (ii) an endogenous limit that restricts students from borrowing
4:119:8328:18:18:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than they spend on their education.5As we show, youth that would like to borrow
4:120:8412:18:17:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than they spend on their schooling (i.e. those constrained by the second limit) invest
4:121:8503:17:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the same amount in their human capital as if they were completely unconstrained. When
4:122:8588:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit is tied directly to investment, there is no tradeoff between additional investment and
4:123:8681:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption while in school — every additional dollar of investment can be borrowed (as

4:126:8978:12:8:72:534:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(2007), Caucutt and Kumar (2003), Hanushek, Leung, and Yilmaz (2003), and Keane and Wolpin (2001).
4:127:9076:8:16:85:539:147:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4We refer to these borrowing limits as ‘endogenous’, because they are a function of the borrower’s invest-
4:128:9182:16:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ment behavior. We do not model the determination of these limits in the GSL system; however, borrowing
4:129:9284:12:8:72:498:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:limits set by private lenders are optimally determined from the incentives of borrowers to default.
4:130:9383:8:16:85:539:111:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5Under the Stafford Loan Program, students face a cumulative loan limit as well as annual borrowing
4:131:9482:16:0:72:366:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:limits which increase somewhat with year of post-secondary school.

5:133:9634:18:18:72:539:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:severely distorted even when schooling and investment decisions are not.6Among youth who
5:134:9722:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would like to invest more than the GSL maximum loan limitdmax, investment is increasing in
5:135:9812:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:family income (or wealth) as has been observed for recent student cohorts. Most importantly,
5:136:9904:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:introducing the restriction that borrowing cannot exceed investment substantially reduces
5:137:9993:18:18:72:501:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the set of individuals for which there is a negative ability – investment relationship.
5:138:10080:18:18:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The recent rise in private lending highlights the importance of studying how private
5:139:10164:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lenders determine student credit levels. Even if human capital cannot be directly repossessed
5:140:10257:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by lenders, creditors can punish defaulting borrowers in a number of ways (e.g. lowering credit
5:141:10352:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:scores, seizing assets, garnisheeing a fraction of labor earnings), which tend to have a greater
5:142:10448:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:impact on debtors with higher post-school earnings. In our lifecycle model, these mechanisms
5:143:10540:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectively link private borrowing limits for students to their abilities and human capital
5:144:10631:18:18:72:539:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investments.7Higher ability students who invest more through education will be offered
5:145:10717:18:18:71:539:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more credit by private lenders, because they can credibly commit to re-pay more given the
5:146:10806:18:17:71:539:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:punishments they face upon default. The dependence of credit limits on investment and
5:147:10891:17:18:71:539:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:ability generates a positive ability – investment relationship forall constrained borrowers
5:148:10982:18:18:72:322:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:under standard parameterizations of preferences.
5:149:11030:18:18:89:539:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our framework incorporates the lending opportunities provided by both GSL programs
5:150:11112:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and private lenders. This not only provides new insights about human capital investment
5:151:11199:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behavior, but it also enables us to better understand the changing role played by private
5:152:11288:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial markets.  In particular, the recent emergence and expansion of private student
5:153:11376:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lending can be explained by the stability of government student loan limits over the last few
5:154:11469:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decades and the recent rise in student demand for credit if: (i) GSL maximum borrowing
5:155:11555:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limits were high enough to finance unrestricted levels of investment in the early 1980s, (ii)
5:156:11648:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these limits are too low to cover the higher levels of investment desired today, and (iii)
5:157:11738:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:current students can credibly commit to re-pay more than these limits allow. The evidence
5:158:11827:18:18:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on family income – college attendance patterns in the NLSY79 and NLSY97 is consistent
5:159:11912:18:18:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the first two conditions. The higher earnings potential of recent graduates, coupled with
5:160:12006:18:17:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher costs of schooling, can explain why more college students are bunching up against
5:161:12094:17:16:85:539:255:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6Thus, evidence that family resources do not affect educational attainment or financial returns does not
5:162:12198:16:12:72:540:239:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:necessarily imply that credit constraints are non-binding. Standard empirical tests for borrowing constraints
5:163:12307:12:12:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:that rely on differences in educational attainment or marginal rates of return on investment by family
5:164:12409:12:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:income (or other categories used to differentiate the ‘constrained’ from ‘unconstrained’) will under-estimate
5:165:12518:12:8:72:533:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the fraction of the population that is constrained as well as the adverse impacts of constraints on welfare.
5:166:12626:8:16:85:539:195:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7Our model of private lending is related to the literature on endogenous credit constraints, which has
5:167:12728:16:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:generally focused on implications for risk-sharing and asset prices in endowment economies (e.g. Alvarez
5:168:12832:12:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Jermann 2000, Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger 2004, Krueger and Perri 2002, Kehoe and Levine
5:169:12929:12:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1993, and Kocherlakota 1996) or firm dynamics (e.g. Albuquerque and Hopenhayn 2004, Monge-Naranjo
5:170:13026:12:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2008). Our assumed punishments for default are similar to those employed by Livshits, MacGee, and Tertilt
5:171:13131:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(2007) in their analysis of bankruptcy over the lifecycle. Andolfatto and Gervais (2006) study human capital
5:172:13239:12:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:accumulation with limited commitment, but they focus on the optimal set of intergenerational transfers and
5:173:13345:12:0:72:290:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:not on cross-sectional implications for investment.
6:174:13397:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:GSL maximum borrowing limits (Berkner 2000 and Titus 2002). This creates new demand
6:175:13480:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for private lenders to step in, offering more credit to those who can credibly commit to
6:176:13568:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:repay. With rising returns to schooling, commitments to repay become credible for more
6:177:13654:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and more college students, suggesting that condition (iii) is likely to be met. Our lifecycle
6:178:13747:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model calibrated to U.S. data generates these patterns in response to a rise in both the
6:179:13835:18:18:72:214:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:returns and costs of college.
6:180:13864:18:18:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we describe borrowing
6:181:13949:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:opportunities from U.S. GSL programs and the recent emergence of private lenders.  In
6:182:14034:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the third section, we discuss evidence on the relationship between ability, family income
6:183:14123:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and college attendance in the U.S. and briefly survey the literature on the prevalence of
6:184:14212:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit constraints. In Section 4, we develop a simple two-period human capital investment
6:185:14301:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model to analytically compare the cross-sectional implications for borrowing and investment
6:186:14392:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:under alternative assumptions about credit markets. Section 5 extends our framework to
6:187:14478:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a lifecycle model that incorporates government subsidies for education. Qualitative results
6:188:14569:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:derived for the two-period model carry over to this environment. We calibrate this model
6:189:14657:17:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using U.S. data on schooling, ability, government subsidies, and post-school earnings. This
6:190:14748:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative analysis shows that our model with both public and private lending does a good
6:191:14839:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:job reproducing observed cross-sectional human capital investment patterns for the early
6:192:14927:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1980s and 2000s. The model with exogenous constraints does not. Our model of endogenous
6:193:15014:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraints also explains both the increased effects of family income on college-going and the
6:194:15108:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rising importance of private lending for recent cohorts as optimal responses to the increased
6:195:15201:18:40:72:482:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs of and financial returns to human capital investment. Section 6 concludes.
6:196:15281:40:30:72:333:358:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:2  Available Sources of Credit
6:197:15311:30:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section briefly reviews the primary sources of borrowing used for human capital invest-
6:198:15403:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment in the U.S. We first describe key institutional features of GSL programs, which we
6:199:15490:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incorporate in our endogenous constraint models below. Then, we discuss the rise of private
6:200:15581:18:34:72:261:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lending for post-secondary schooling.
6:201:15618:34:26:72:370:240:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2.1  Government Student Loan Programs
6:202:15655:26:18:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Federal student loans are an important source of finance for higher education in the U.S., ac-
6:203:15749:18:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:counting for 71% of the federal student aid disbursed in 2003-04.8Most of these government-
6:204:15840:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:backed loans are provided through the Stafford Loan program, which awarded nearly $50
6:205:15925:18:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:billion to students in the 2003-04 academic year, compared to the disbursement of $1.6 billion
6:206:16019:18:17:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through the Perkins Loan program. Slightly more than $7 billion was awarded to parents of
6:207:16108:17:0:85:433:125:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:A:8Many other countries have similar types of government student loan programs.
7:208:16186:0:18:72:537:775:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:undergraduate students in the form of Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS).9
7:209:16272:18:18:89:539:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:GSL programs generally have three important features. First, lending is directly tied to
7:210:16360:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment. Students (or parents) can only borrow up to the total cost of college (including
7:211:16452:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tuition, room, board, books, supplies, transportation, computers, and other expenses directly
7:212:16545:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related to schooling) less any other financial aid they receive in the forms of grants or
7:213:16634:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:scholarships. Thus, students cannot borrow from GSL programs to finance non-schooling
7:214:16719:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related consumption goods or activities. Second, student loan programs set fixed upper limits
7:215:16812:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the total amount of credit available for each student. Students face both cumulative and
7:216:16903:18:18:72:539:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:annual loan limits for U.S. federal loan programs.10Third, loans covered by GSL programs
7:217:16991:18:18:72:481:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:typically have extended enforcement rules compared to unsecured private loans.
7:218:17069:18:18:89:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Historically, private lenders have provided the capital to student borrowers (and their
7:219:17156:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parents) under the Stafford and PLUS programs, the government guaranteeing those loans
7:220:17242:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a promise to cover any unpaid amounts. Since the 1994-95 academic year, the federal
7:221:17330:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:government has begun to directly provide these loans to some students under the same rules
7:222:17420:18:17:72:539:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and terms.11While Stafford loans are disbursed to students, PLUS loans can be taken out by
7:223:17510:17:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parents to help cover the costs of their children’s schooling. Another major federal student
7:224:17602:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan program, the Perkins Loan Program, provides an additional source of government funds
7:225:17691:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to students most in need; however, its loan offerings depend on the level of program funding
7:226:17783:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at the post-secondary institution attended by a student. In practice, Perkins loans make up
7:227:17874:18:18:72:350:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a small fraction of federal student loan disbursements.
7:228:17929:18:18:89:539:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 1 reports loan limits (based on the dependency status and class level of each
7:229:18012:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:student) for Stafford and Perkins student loan programs for the period 1993-2007.12In recent
7:230:18104:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:years, dependent students could borrow up to $23,000 from the Stafford Loan Program over
7:231:18192:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the course of their undergraduate careers. Independent students could borrow roughly twice
7:232:18282:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that amount, although most traditional undergraduates would not fall into this category.

7:239:18926:16:8:72:516:226:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:still cannot borrow more than the total cost of college less other financial aid received by the student.
7:240:19031:8:16:81:539:218:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11The Stafford program offers both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The government covers the interest
7:241:19135:16:12:72:540:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:on subsidized loans while students are enrolled. Unsubsidized loans accrue interest over this period; however,

7:243:19354:11:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:students must demonstrate financial need on the basis of family income, dependency status, and the cost of
7:244:19460:12:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the school attended. Most students under age 24 are considered dependent, and their parents’ income is an
7:245:19565:12:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:important determinant of their financial need. Prior to the introduction of unsubsidized Stafford Loans in
7:246:19671:12:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the early 1990s, Supplemental Loans to Students (SLS) were an alternative source of unsubsidized federal

9:320:23552:12:12:72:540:209:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:in real terms from 1986–87 to 2006–07, roughly the time our NLSY respondents would have began attending

10:326:23992:26:18:72:540:749:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Until the mid-1990s, few private lenders offered loans to students outside the GSL programs.
10:327:24084:18:18:72:540:731:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In 1995-96, total non-federal student loans amounted to $1.3 billion.  By 2004-05, that
10:328:24171:18:18:72:540:713:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:amount had risen to almost $14 billion (nearly 20% of all student loans distributed).19Private
10:329:24265:18:18:72:540:695:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:student loans generally charge higher interest rates than Stafford or Perkins loans and are,
10:330:24357:18:18:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore, typically taken after exhausting available credit from GSL programs. Thus, the
10:331:24446:18:18:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rise in borrowing from private lenders outside the Stafford and Perkins Loan Programs
10:332:24531:18:18:72:540:641:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that the GSL limits are no longer enough to satisfy many students’ demands for
10:333:24618:18:18:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit. Private loans are most prevalent among graduate students (especially in professional
10:334:24710:18:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schools) and undergraduates at high-cost private universities (Wegmann, Cunningham and
10:335:24796:18:17:72:154:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Merisotis 2003).
10:336:24812:17:18:89:539:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:While many private student lending programs are loosely structured like the federal GSL
10:337:24899:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:programs (i.e. many limit borrowing to the cost of schooling less financial aid or a fixed upper
10:338:24995:18:18:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limit on total borrowing), they vary substantially in their terms and eligibility requirements.
10:339:25090:18:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Private lending programs typically use a broader concept of schooling costs than do GSL
10:340:25177:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:programs, often allowing students to borrow against previous educational expenses or ex-
10:341:25265:18:18:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:penses for study abroad. Specified maximum loan limits are generally quite high, especially
10:342:25356:18:18:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for students in professional schools (e.g. law, medical, or business schools); however, actual
10:343:25450:18:18:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:amounts offered to students vary depending on their creditworthiness, institution attended,
10:344:25541:18:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and area of study. A cosigner with a good credit history tends to improve the terms of any
10:345:25631:18:40:72:395:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans and can affect whether a loan is offered in the first place.

10:351:26112:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:student cohorts, there is a much stronger relationship between family income (or wealth) and
10:352:26204:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:college attendance. Third, in both the early 1980s and the early 2000s, there is a strong
10:353:26293:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positive relationship between college attendance and cognitive ability or achievement (as
10:354:26382:18:18:72:421:213:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:measured by scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, AFQT).20
10:355:26446:18:18:89:539:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Many empirical studies using NLSY79 data conclude that borrowing constraints played
10:356:26529:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:little role in college attendance decisions in the U.S. during the early 1980s.  Cameron
10:357:26617:18:15:81:539:159:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:19These figures do not include student borrowing on credit cards, which has also increased considerably
10:358:26720:15:9:72:260:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:over this period. See College Board (2005).
10:359:26763:9:15:81:539:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:20This evidence is largely based on the NLSY79 and NLSY97. AFQT scores are widely used as measures
10:360:26861:15:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of cognitive achievement by social scientists and are strongly correlated with post-school earnings conditional
10:361:26972:12:0:72:499:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:on educational attainment. See, e.g., Cawley,et al.2000. Appendix A provides additional details.
11:362:27069:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Heckman (1998, 1999) find that after controlling for family background, AFQT scores,
11:363:27157:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and unobserved heterogeneity, family income has little effect on college enrollment rates.
11:364:27247:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Carneiro and Heckman (2002) also estimate small differences in college enrollment rates
11:365:27334:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other college-going outcomes by family income after accounting for differences in family
11:366:27426:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:background and AFQT. Cameron and Taber (2004) find little evidence of differential returns
11:367:27516:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to school that would be consistent with borrowing constraints. Keane and Wolpin (2001)
11:368:27602:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate a structural model of schooling and work that incorporates constraints on borrowing
11:369:27694:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and parental transfers that may depend on child schooling decisions. While they estimate
11:370:27782:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:very tight borrowing limits (much more stringent than federal student loan limits), they find
11:371:27875:18:18:72:397:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:little effect of borrowing constraints on educational attainment.
11:372:27940:18:18:89:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Much has changed since the early 1980s, when the NLSY79 respondents made their
11:373:28018:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:college attendance decisions. Financial returns to schooling have risen dramatically (Katz
11:374:28108:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Autor 1999, Heckman, Lochner, and Todd 2008) as have the costs of tuition, fees, room,
11:375:28198:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and board at U.S. colleges and universities (College Board 2005). At the same time, real
11:376:28286:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing limits associated with government student loan programs have remained stable
11:377:28372:17:18:72:206:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or declined (see Figure 1).
11:378:28399:18:18:89:539:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:These trends appear to have increased the importance of borrowing constraints. Indeed,

11:380:28569:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:federal Stafford Student Loan Program went up from only 18% in 1989-90 to 52% in 1999-
11:381:28655:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2000. Among dependent undergraduates, the fraction increases to nearly 70% of all borrowers
11:382:28746:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in 1999-2000 (Berkner 2000 and Titus 2002). Moreover, Belley and Lochner (2007) show
11:383:28830:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that family income has become a much more important determinant of college attendance
11:384:28915:18:18:72:539:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for college-going decisions in the early 2000s.21Youth from high income families in the
11:385:29002:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:NLSY97 are sixteen percentage points more likely to attend college than are youth from
11:386:29088:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:low income families, conditional on AFQT scores, family composition, parental age and
11:387:29173:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:education, race/ethnicity, and urban/rural residence. This is nearly twice the effect observed
11:388:29267:18:18:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the NLSY79. The combined effects of family income and wealth are even more dramatic
11:389:29353:18:18:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the NLSY97. Comparing youth from the highest family income and wealth quartiles to
11:390:29438:18:18:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:those from the lowest quartiles yields an estimated difference in college attendance rates of
11:391:29531:18:17:72:478:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nearly 30 percentage points after controlling for ability and family background.
11:392:29611:17:18:89:539:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we examine the effects of ability (as measured by AFQT scores) on college atten-

11:394:29784:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and NLSY97. (See Appendix A for a detailed description of the data and variables used

11:396:29970:16:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:coming more important by the early 1990s. Using data on youth of college-ages in the 1970s, 1980s, and
11:397:30072:12:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1990s (from the Health and Retirement Survey), Brown, Seshadri, and Scholz (2007) estimate that borrowing
11:398:30177:12:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:constraints limit college-going; however, they do not examine whether constraints have become more limit-
11:399:30282:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ing in recent years. While Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2007) find little effect of borrowing constraints
11:400:30391:12:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(defined by the self-reported desire to borrow more for school) on overall college dropout rates for a recent
11:401:30500:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:cohort of students at Berea College, they find substantial differences in dropout rates between those who are
11:402:30609:12:0:72:535:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:constrained and those who are not. They do not study the effects of borrowing constraints on attendance.
12:403:30714:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:here.) Figure 2 shows college attendance rates by AFQT quartiles and either family income
12:404:30803:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or family wealth quartiles in the NLSY79 and NLSY97. For all family income or wealth cat-
12:405:30892:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:egories in both NLSY samples, we observe substantial increases in college attendance with
12:406:30981:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:AFQT. The difference in attendance rates between the highest and lowest ability quartiles
12:407:31070:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:range from .47 to .68 depending on the family income or wealth quartile. Most importantly
12:408:31159:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for our theoretical analysis below, there is no indication that the effects of ability are negative
12:409:31258:18:18:72:526:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for lower income youth who are most likely to be constrained, especially in the NLSY97.
12:410:31345:18:18:89:539:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Of course, AFQT scores may be correlated with other family background variables that
12:411:31429:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:influence college attendance decisions conditional on family resources. We, therefore, control
12:412:31523:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for a host of other family background measures in addition to AFQT quartiles using ordinary
12:413:31614:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:least squares. Table 2 reports the estimated effects of AFQT (these estimates reflect the
12:414:31703:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference in attendance rates between the reported AFQT quartile and AFQT quartile 1)
12:415:31789:18:18:72:539:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on college attendance after controlling for family background characteristics.22Results are

12:417:31972:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the general patterns observed in Figure 2:  ability has strong positive effects on college
12:418:32062:17:40:72:469:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:attendance for all family income and wealth quartiles in both NLSY samples.

12:420:32177:30:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We now develop a simple two-period model to study the impact of credit constraints on
12:421:32262:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment in human capital. We allow for some generality in preferences and skill production
12:422:32355:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and derive the qualitative investment – wealth and investment – ability relationships implied
12:423:32448:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by alternative forms of credit constraints. We show that these relationships depend crucially
12:424:32541:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the nature of credit constraints and evaluate the empirical relevance of the different

16:555:38043:25:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:At least since Becker (1975), economists have introduced financial market imperfections in
16:556:38133:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models of human capital. With imperfect access to credit, Becker shows that youth from
16:557:38219:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:poor families will invest less (and have higher marginal returns on schooling) than otherwise
16:558:38312:18:18:72:272:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identical youth from wealthier families.
16:559:38352:18:18:89:539:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Credit constraints are typically introduced by imposing a fixed and exogenous upper
16:560:38435:18:18:72:539:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound on the amount of debt.23Following this approach, assume that borrowing is restricted
16:561:38525:18:18:72:218:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the exogenous constraint:

16:614:39717:12:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:assumes that individuals face an increasing interest rate schedule as a function of their investment. Becker’s
16:615:39827:12:0:72:340:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:formulation yields similar predictions to those discussed here.

17:649:41248:18:18:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We highlight three important results. First, constrained investment never exceeds un-
17:650:41333:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constrained investment, i.e.hX(a, w)≤hU(a). This result holds for all forms of constraints
17:651:41423:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:considered in the paper.  Second, constrained investment is strictly increasing in wealth.
17:652:41513:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Third, constrained investment may be increasing or decreasing in ability depending on the

17:663:42055:30:18:89:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results (i), (ii) and (iii) are well-known and already discussed in Becker (1975). They
17:664:42142:18:18:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are central to the empirical literature on credit constraints.  For instance, Cameron and
17:665:42231:18:18:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Heckman (1998, 1999), Ellwood and Kane (2000), Carneiro and Heckman (2002), and Belley
17:666:42317:18:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Lochner (2007) empirically examine if youth from lower income families acquire less
17:667:42404:18:18:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schooling, conditional on family background and ability.  Lang (1993), Card (1995), and
17:668:42491:18:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Cameron and Taber (2004) explore the prediction that the marginal return on human capital
17:669:42580:18:18:72:325:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment exceeds the return on financial assets.
17:670:42630:18:18:89:539:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The more interesting and novel result is (iv). It reveals a serious shortcoming of this
17:671:42717:18:0:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model that the literature has not recognized. The model predicts anegativerelationship
18:672:42805:0:18:72:539:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between ability and investment for an IES below one.24This is a serious problem, because
18:673:42893:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most estimates of the IES are less than one (see Browning, Hansen, Heckman 1999) and a
18:674:42979:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positive relationship between ability and investment is a robust empirical regularity. The
18:675:43069:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between ability and investment for constrained youth derives from two opposing
18:676:43160:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects. On the one hand, an increase in ability raises the financial returns to investment,
18:677:43252:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which encourages investment.  On the other hand, ability raises lifetime income, which
18:678:43338:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:encourages early consumption. Since constrained youth can only increase early consumption
18:679:43427:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by investing less, strong preferences for smoothing (i.e. IES≤1) imply that the second effect
18:680:43520:18:35:72:127:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dominates.

18:686:43775:24:18:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the absence of other sources of credit, (TIC) is equivalent toc0≥w. This constraint is
18:687:43864:18:18:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:endogenous in the sense that borrowing limits depend on the amount of investment under-
18:688:43951:18:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f11:B:taken by an individual. Second, borrowing is constrained by an upper limit 0< dmax<∞
18:689:44035:18:18:72:253:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the total credit to each student:

18:691:44082:25:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This second constraint is effectively the same as the exogenous constraint above. The overall
18:692:44175:18:29:72:295:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit limits induced by GSL programs are:

18:695:44305:18:18:89:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To see the implications of (TIC), first assume that it is the only constraint.25In this
18:696:44392:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, individuals are unconstrained if their desired investment exceeds desired borrowing, i.e.
18:697:44487:18:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:hU(a)≥dU(a, w). These are individuals who hold wealth that exceeds the finite threshold
18:698:44574:18:18:74:539:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: ̃wmin(a), which is increasing in abilityabut at a slower rate thanwXmin(a), as shown in
18:699:44662:18:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Appendix B. In comparison to exogenous constraint models, (TIC) is more (less) stringent
18:700:44750:18:18:72:539:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:B:than (EXC) for low (high) ability individuals in the sense that  ̃wmin(a)> wXmin(a) ifhU(a)<

18:702:44882:18:16:81:539:175:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:24AnIES≤1 is only a sufficient condition for a negative ability – investment relationship. More generally,
18:703:44988:16:12:72:540:159:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the model may predict a negative relationship for IES values greater than one. While the model formally
18:704:45091:12:12:72:540:147:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:abstracts from foregone earnings, it is isomorphic to one in which foregone earnings for any given investment,
18:705:45201:12:12:72:539:135:10:g_d0_f20:10:g_d0_f6:F:h, are independent of ability. Result (iv) holds more generally in a model with foregone earnings as long as
18:706:45309:12:8:72:307:123:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:youth wage rates are not strictly decreasing in ability.
18:707:45365:8:16:81:539:115:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:25This is the most appropriate model when upper borrowing limits are non-existent or set very high (e.g.
18:708:45469:16:0:72:237:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:PLUS program for students’ parents).
19:709:45507:0:18:89:539:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:If (TIC) is the only binding condition, thend=handc0=w. As such, the maximization

19:714:45628:23:18:72:539:716:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which is equivalent to maximizing late consumption,c1=af(h)−Rh. In this case, optimal
19:715:45713:18:18:72:337:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment equals the unconstrained amounthU(a).
19:716:45761:18:18:89:539:680:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Tying borrowing to investment removes the conflict between smoothing consumption and
19:717:45845:18:18:72:540:662:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:maximizing net lifetime resources. If (TIC) is the only constraint on credit, everyone ends up
19:718:45939:18:18:72:539:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investing the unconstrained amount,hU(a), regardless of initial wealth. Only consumption
19:719:46027:18:18:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decisions are distorted by the constraint. Empirical tests based on investment differences
19:720:46117:18:18:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by family resources would always conclude that borrowing constraints are non-binding, even
19:721:46207:18:18:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:when consumption allocations are distorted.Empirical tests must use measures of consump-
19:722:46295:18:18:72:273:572:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:tion over time to detect this constraint.
19:723:46336:18:18:89:539:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consider now the full GSL constraint (GSLC).  For ease of exposition, assume that
19:724:46417:18:18:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:dmax=d0, so (EXC) coincides with (7). In this case, unconstrained individuals are those
19:725:46504:18:18:72:539:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whose wealth exceeds the thresholdwGmin(a)≡max{wXmin(a), ̃wmin(a)}, which increases with
19:726:46592:18:17:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:abilitya, because bothwXmin(a) and  ̃wmin(a) do. Let  ̄adenote the highest ability for which
19:727:46684:17:18:72:496:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the unconstrained investment can be financed by the GSL alone, i.e.hU( ̄a) =dmax.
19:728:46765:18:18:89:539:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We now examine the relationship between investment, ability and wealth under a GSL
19:729:46847:18:18:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:program. Of course, those with wealthw≥wGmin(a) are unconstrained and investhU(a).
19:730:46929:18:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:They are able to smooth consumption optimally. There are three potential groups of con-
19:731:47016:18:18:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:strained individuals withw < wGmin(a). The first group is composed of lower ability persons
19:732:47107:18:18:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:witha < ̄awho are constrained by (TIC) only. They invest the unrestricted levelhU(a)
19:733:47191:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but would like to borrow more for consumption purposes. The second and third groups are
19:734:47278:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:composed of more able individuals witha > ̄a.  The second group is constrained by (7)
19:735:47363:18:18:71:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only. These individuals borrowdmaxand invest more than this using some of their initial
19:736:47450:18:18:72:539:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assetswto help finance schooling. For them, the GSL and exogenous constraint models are
19:737:47537:18:18:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equivalent. Investment coincides withhX(a, w), because (TIC) is slack. The third group of
19:738:47626:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:very poor high ability youth is constrained by both (7) and (TIC). They borrow and invest
19:739:47715:18:18:72:217:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the maximum amount,dmax.
19:740:47739:18:27:89:415:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The previous discussion can be formally summarized as follows:
19:741:47801:27:18:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f4:F:Proposition 2Assume thatu(·)has IES≤1. Letdmax=d0>0, andhG(a, w),hX(a, w),

20:753:48282:0:18:89:539:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Regardless of the IES,hG(a, w) always has a region in which it is increasing in ability,a,
20:754:48372:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and independent of initial wealth,w, and may have another region in which it is constant and
20:755:48464:18:18:72:539:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equal todmax.26If utility has an IES less than or equal to 1, there is a region (of middle-high
20:756:48559:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:abilities) in which investment decreases with ability as in the exogenous constraint model,
20:757:48650:18:18:72:355:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but the additional constraint (TIC) shrinks this region.
20:758:48706:18:18:89:539:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the behavior ofhG(a, w),hX(a, w), andhU(a) for the empirically
20:759:48795:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relevant case of IES≤1. These figures also display unconstrained borrowing as a function
20:760:48883:18:18:72:539:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of ability for different levels of wealth. (Recall that  ̄ais the ability level satisfyinghU( ̄a) =

20:762:49075:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constrained.)  Figure 3 displays investment and borrowing behavior for two low levels of
20:763:49163:18:18:72:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wealth,  ̄wand a lower levelwL< ̄w.  The figure reveals that under the GSL, all low-
20:764:49247:18:18:72:539:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wealth individuals with ability below  ̄ainvest the unrestricted levelhU(a), while those with

20:766:49432:18:18:72:539:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constant in ability and independent of wealth (for any wealthw≤ ̄w). Contrast this with
20:767:49519:18:17:72:539:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the behavior ofhX(a, wL), which is increasing inwand decreasing inaabovea2, the point at

20:769:49691:18:18:72:131:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraints.
20:770:49703:18:18:89:539:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 illustrates investment behavior for a higher level of wealthwH> ̄w. In this
20:771:49787:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, optimal investment is the same under the GSL and exogenous constraints up to ability
20:772:49877:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:levela4. Hence, it first coincides withhU(a) untildU(a, wH) reachesdmaxat abilitya3; then
20:773:49966:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it decreases in ability througha4. Above this point, more able individuals are constrained
20:774:50056:18:18:71:539:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to investdmaxby (TIC). Without this constraint, these individuals would invest less than
20:775:50144:18:18:71:291:380:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:dmaxas in the exogenous constraint model.
20:776:50185:18:18:89:539:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Three points about investment under the GSL are worth highlighting.  First, invest-
20:777:50268:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment under the GSL equals the unconstrained level for a larger range of middle ability
20:778:50354:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and low/middle wealth individuals than under exogenous constraints (e.g. individuals with
20:779:50443:18:18:72:539:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wealthwLand abilitya∈(a2, ̄a] in Figure 3). While constraint (TIC) increases the number
20:780:50530:18:18:71:539:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of constrained agents, it also encourages investment for those who would like to borrow more
20:781:50622:18:18:71:539:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than they spend on schooling. This implies a positive relationship between investment and
20:782:50711:18:17:71:539:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ability and no relationship between investment and wealth for a broader range of ability
20:783:50799:17:18:71:539:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and wealth levels. Second, among higher ability and middle/high wealth individuals, the
20:784:50886:18:18:71:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(TIC) restriction ensures that investment never falls belowdmax. With an IES less than one,
20:785:50977:18:18:71:539:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this shrinks the range of abilities for which investment is negatively related to ability (e.g.
20:786:51072:18:18:71:539:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individuals with abilitya > a4in Figure 4). Third, among high ability types, investment
20:787:51159:18:19:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is weakly increasing in initial assets (e.g. individuals with abilitya∈(a3, a4) in Figure 4).
20:788:51252:19:15:81:540:146:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:26IfhX(a, w) is always increasing ina(e.g. for an IES sufficiently greater than one), thenhG(a, w) is
20:789:51353:15:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:globally increasing in both arguments. The characterization is as follows:hG(a, w) =hU(a), fora≤ ̄aor

22:812:52094:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dividuals whose investment declines with ability is smaller than in the traditional exogenous

22:823:52936:29:18:89:539:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:On one hand, the addition of (TIC) reduces the feasible set and hence attainable utility
22:824:53024:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:levels. On the other hand, it relieves the tension between income maximization and con-

22:826:53202:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important for those who would like to borrow more than they want to invest. The GSL
22:827:53285:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces these individuals to invest more than they would otherwise choose and can dramati-

22:832:53645:18:17:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Most often, however, the nature of credit limits that arise from these incentive problems
22:833:53734:17:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is left unexplored. In this subsection, we consider constraints that arise from the limited
22:834:53825:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:commitment of borrowers to repay loans. In the following subsection, we consider the coex-
22:835:53915:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:istence of private lenders that face limited commitment from borrowers with a GSL program
22:836:54004:18:18:72:203:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that is perfectly enforced.
22:837:54031:18:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A rational borrower repays his loans if and only if the cost of repaying is lower than
22:838:54117:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the cost of defaulting. The incentive to repay can be foreseen by rational lenders who, in
22:839:54207:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:response, limit their supply of credit.27Since penalties for default impose a larger monetary
22:840:54300:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost for borrowers with higher earnings and assets — only so much can be taken from someone
22:841:54391:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with little to take — the credit offered to an individual is directly related to his perceived
22:842:54485:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:future earnings. Since earnings are determined by ability and investment, credit limits and
22:843:54576:18:17:72:347:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investments will be jointly determined in equilibrium.

23:845:54727:0:18:89:539:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To examine human capital in this environment, we first characterize the credit con-

23:847:54897:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that lenders can punish defaulting borrowers by garnisheeing a fraction  ̃κ∈(0,1) of their
23:848:54987:18:18:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earnings.28In Section 5.5, we incorporate additional punishments for default in a richer

23:852:55269:18:25:72:343:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Foreseeing this, lenders choose to limit borrowing to:

23:865:55938:18:18:71:370:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:may reduce the likelihood that an individual is constrained.

23:869:56246:18:18:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:late consumption. However, this is not true at higher levels, where the marginal returns to

24:928:59188:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:programs have much stronger punishments at their disposal than we observe for private

24:937:59598:19:16:81:539:172:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:29Alternatively, consider the other extreme in which loans from the GSL face the same limited repayment
24:938:59701:16:12:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:incentives as private loans. In this case, the presence of the GSL program can only make a difference with

24:943:60234:12:0:71:358:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the allocations coincide with the model with only private lending.

25:947:60419:18:18:89:539:697:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As with the previous models, for each ability levela, there is a finite threshold level

25:956:60845:18:18:89:539:607:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We first compare our model with both private and government lending with our model
25:957:60927:18:18:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with only private lending. The introduction of a GSL program that fully enforces investments

25:960:61190:18:18:72:539:535:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment ofdmax. This investment ensures the repayment of at leastκaf[dmax] in private
25:961:61278:18:17:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans, which private lenders are willing to provide. The availability of extra resources allows
25:962:61373:17:18:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for additional investment, which further increases the credit available from private sources.
25:963:61466:18:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Individuals for whomwG+Lmin(a)< w < wLmin(a) invest more under private lenders and the

25:965:61587:18:18:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We now compare our model with both private and government lending to the GSL

25:976:62190:18:18:72:539:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and investment. For those withwG+Lmin(a)< w < wGmin(a), investment is higher with private

25:985:62903:31:18:89:539:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The implied relationship between human capital investment, ability, and wealth is as
25:986:62987:18:18:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follows. If ability is low (i.e.a < ̄a), investment equals the unconstrained amount for any
25:987:63078:18:0:71:539:97:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:w. Among more able agents witha≥ ̄a, those withw≥wG+Lmin(a) are unconstrained and
26:988:63161:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the rest are constrained. For the latter,hL+G(a, w) is less thanhU(a) and increases with
26:989:63249:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wealth,w. Under the conditions of Proposition 3,hL+G(a, w) is increasing in ability, and
26:990:63337:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model with both private lenders and the GSL is qualitatively consistent with investment
26:991:63428:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:patterns in the data. The existence of the GSL ensures the unconstrained optimal amount
26:992:63515:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of investment for a broader range of ability and wealth levels, while the existence of private
26:993:63609:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lenders delivers the empirically observed positive ability – investment relationship over the
26:994:63702:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:full distribution of abilities and wealth levels. Both sources of credit play an important role
26:995:63797:18:18:72:209:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in determining investment.
26:996:63823:18:18:89:539:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our preferred model for studying human capital formation includes both public and
26:997:63904:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:private sources of lending. First, both sources provide significant credit for higher education
26:998:63999:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the U.S. Second, incorporating the combined constraints of GSL programs and private
26:999:64085:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lenders in our model produces patterns for investment, ability, and family resources that are
26:1000:64178:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualitatively consistent with U.S. data. Moreover, as we now show, a calibrated model with
26:1001:64268:18:40:72:333:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both sources of credit performs well quantitatively.
26:1002:64320:40:29:72:288:501:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5  A Quantitative Model
26:1003:64343:29:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we extend our framework to a multi-period setting and incorporate education
26:1004:64435:18:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subsidies in order to explore the quantitative implications of alternative forms of borrow-
26:1005:64526:18:18:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing constraints. After calibrating the model to match the U.S. economy, we compare the
26:1006:64612:18:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predicted cross-sectional patterns for investment, ability, and wealth under different assump-
26:1007:64706:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions about credit constraints. We also simulate an increase in both the returns to and costs
26:1008:64799:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of schooling (as observed over the 1980s and 1990s in the U.S.) in order to see whether our
26:1009:64890:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model with public and private lending can explain the rising importance of family resources

26:1011:65073:18:34:72:452:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well when compared against the empirical patterns discussed in Section 3.

27:1032:65914:18:18:71:261:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determine the returns on investment.
27:1033:65950:18:18:89:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For simplicity, we assume that the market interest rate equalsρ, so individuals prefer

27:1056:67291:18:17:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regarding the timing of investment, we assume thatgs=ρ. This allows us to focus on the
27:1057:67377:17:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:total stock of investment,h, while ignoring the particular investment sequence that lead to
27:1058:67468:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:h. The constantμ≡ρ/[eρ−1] is introduced as a normalization to simplify some of the

27:1061:67686:18:15:81:539:230:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:30For simplicity of exposition, we will assume that human capital is produced from goods rather than
27:1062:67786:15:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:time inputs. We could equivalently assume that human capital investment only requires time inputs and
27:1063:67887:12:12:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:that an individual’s total ‘initial wealth’,w, reflects family transfers plus the total discounted value of
27:1064:67994:12:12:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:earnings he could receive if he worked (rather than attended school) full-time during “youth”. In this case,
27:1065:68102:12:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:private investment costs reflect any earnings foregone for school. Our calibration below implicitly assumes
27:1066:68209:12:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:both goods and time investments are perfectly substitutable and combines these costs to determine total

27:1069:68415:12:16:81:539:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:32Given our assumptions below, the timing of ‘free’ investment will be irrelevant – only the total discounted

29:1201:72836:18:34:72:244:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holds. See details in Appendix C.

29:1203:72913:26:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Now, consider private loans for schooling that are subject to limited enforcement. As in the
29:1204:73005:18:0:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two-period model, loans are repaid if and only if the cost of defaulting is higher than the
30:1205:73098:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost of repaying. The incentives to repay at datest≥1 define the amount of credit lenders
30:1206:73187:18:18:72:325:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are willing to supply during the schooling period.
30:1207:73237:18:18:89:539:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We consider two penalties for default. First, defaulting borrowers are reported to credit
30:1208:73326:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bureaus, an action that is assumed to prevent the borrower from accessing formal credit
30:1209:73413:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markets for some period. This penalty does not reduce earnings, but it disrupts the ability
30:1210:73504:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to smooth consumption and can be quite costly if labor earnings grow quickly with age or
30:1211:73592:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if the IES is low. Second, the borrower forfeits a fractionγ∈[0,1) of his labor earnings.
30:1212:73681:18:18:72:539:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The fractionγencompasses direct garnishments from lenders as well as the costs of actions
30:1213:73770:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:taken by the borrower to avoid direct penalties (e.g. working in the informal sector, renting
30:1214:73863:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instead of owning a house, etc.). We assume that both penalties are active for an interval of
30:1215:73956:18:18:72:415:595:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:length 0< π < P−1 that starts the moment default takes place.34
30:1216:74019:18:18:89:539:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consistent with our earlier assumptions about post-investment credit markets, we assume
30:1217:74106:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that loans contracted after schooling are fully enforceable and that loans contracted while
30:1218:74197:18:18:72:539:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in school can only be defaulted on at aget= 1. We explicitly focus on credit constraints
30:1219:74285:18:17:72:309:523:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:directly related to the financing of schooling.35
30:1220:74334:17:18:89:539:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The amount of debt that a person can credibly commit to repay depends on the discounted
30:1221:74421:18:18:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:utility associated with default. Consider a person with abilityaand human capitalhthat

30:1223:74593:18:18:72:539:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaults would be on the entire debt. During the punishment period [1,1 +π], consumption
30:1224:74681:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:isc(t) = (1−γ)μ−1ahαeg(t−1). Fromt= 1 +πonwards, a fresh start allows the person
30:1225:74761:18:18:72:539:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to fully smooth consumption, including the time after retirement. The maximizedt= 1

30:1243:75447:18:18:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions to consumption profiles. Notice that credit limits are proportional to labor earnings,
30:1244:75539:18:18:72:539:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:just as we imposed in the two-period model. However, in this model, the value ofκis deter-
30:1245:75629:18:18:72:539:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mined by preferences (ρ, σ) and institutions (γ, π). Below we show thatκcan be large even
30:1246:75718:18:16:72:270:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if wage garnishments,γ, are negligible.

31:1250:75974:0:18:89:539:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Some aspects of the determination ofκare worth mentioning. First,κis increasing in
31:1251:76056:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:γandπ. The option to default is less tempting with harsher punishments. Second,κ >0
31:1252:76139:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as long asπ >0, even ifγ= 0.  The exclusion from financial markets alone suffices to
31:1253:76223:18:18:72:539:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sustain lending. Third, ifπ= 0, the model boils down to an exogenous constraint model
31:1254:76308:18:18:72:444:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:withd0= 0, since no lending can be sustained in equilibrium, i.e.κ= 0.
31:1255:76378:18:18:89:539:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:With credit limits determined by limited commitment, a person chooses investment,
31:1256:76459:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption and borrowing (x≥0,c0≥0 andd) to maximizeU(c0, x, d;a) subject to (18)

31:1271:77191:30:18:89:539:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This proposition is central to our quantitative analysis of credit constraints, given its
31:1272:77280:18:18:72:241:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:empirically verifiable predictions.
31:1273:77315:18:18:89:539:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Recall from our discussion in Section 4.3 that strong preferences for smooth consumption
31:1274:77403:18:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(i.e. a highσor low IES) generate a negative ability – investment relationship when credit
31:1275:77493:18:18:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraints are exogenously fixed. This tendency also exists when constraints are endogenous
31:1276:77585:18:18:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since∂κ(σ)/∂σ≥0, which implies that a stronger link between investment and credit
31:1277:77666:18:18:71:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limits (i.e. a largerκ) is needed to generate a positive ability – investment relationship as
31:1278:77759:18:18:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:preferences for smooth consumption become stronger.  However, a greater preference for
31:1279:77845:18:18:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smooth consumption profiles also makes the default punishment of exclusion from credit
31:1280:77931:18:18:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markets more painful.  Private lenders will be willing to offer more credit if the cost of
31:1281:78021:18:18:71:540:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaulting is higher. Thus,κis also increasing inσunder limited commitment. Below, we
31:1282:78106:18:18:71:540:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:show that for empirically plausible punishment parameters (γ, π) the effect ofσonκoften
31:1283:78193:18:18:72:539:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dominates its effect onκ(σ), and a higher value ofσ(or lower IES) makes it more rather
31:1284:78279:18:17:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than less likely that condition (iii) of this proposition holds. Most importantly, we show
31:1285:78369:17:18:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thatκ > κ(σ) for empirically plausible parameters, so that the model implies a positive
31:1286:78456:18:35:72:495:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between investment and ability for all ability and initial wealth levels.

31:1288:78578:26:18:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we consider the coexistence of a GSL program with private lenders.  As before,
31:1289:78665:18:18:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we assume that the repayment of loans from the GSL program is fully enforced. As noted
31:1290:78751:18:17:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earlier, this assumption is in line with the fact that GSL programs in the U.S. are better
31:1291:78841:17:0:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:protected against default than private unsecured loans. First, private loans can be cleared
32:1292:78934:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in bankruptcy proceedings while GSL loans cannot. This implies a longer (potentially un-
32:1293:79022:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limited) punishment period for government loans. Second, wage garnishments of up to 15%
32:1294:79109:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are explicitly incorporated in GSL programs, whereas no explicit rate exists for private un-
32:1295:79201:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:secured loans.  Third, GSL programs include a wide array of additional punishments for
32:1296:79287:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:those who default that have no counterpart in the private sector (e.g. governments can seize
32:1297:79379:18:18:72:405:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income tax returns for those defaulting on a GSL program loan).

32:1306:79922:18:18:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and fewer people are constrained than under the GSL alone or under private markets alone.

32:1309:80094:26:18:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We now calibrate parameter values to explore the quantitative implications of the model.
32:1310:80182:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Some of the parameters are estimated using data on earnings and educational attainment
32:1311:80268:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the random sample of males in the NLSY79. Other parameter values are calibrated
32:1312:80352:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to replicate features of the U.S. economy. We use AFQT quartiles to measure ability. All
32:1313:80440:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dollar amounts are denominated in 1999 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).
32:1314:80526:18:18:72:461:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table 3 reports the value of all parameters used in our baseline simulations.
32:1315:80603:18:17:89:539:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that youth (investment period) begins at age 16 and ends at age 24. Maturity
32:1316:80689:17:18:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(labor market participation period) runs from age 24 until age 65. Retirement runs from
32:1317:80776:18:18:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:age 65 until death at age 80. Since youth lasts one period in the model, each interval of
32:1318:80865:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unit length corresponds to 8 years of life. Dates for retirement and death are, respectively,
32:1319:80958:18:18:72:338:239:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:P= (65−16)/8 = 6.125, andT= (80−16)/8 = 8.
32:1320:81000:18:18:89:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To match an annual interest rate of 4%, we setρ= 8×ln(1.04) = 0.319 for the value of
32:1321:81084:18:18:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the discount rate in the model. We setσ= 2 as our baseline value to match an IES of 0.5,
32:1322:81172:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an intermediate value in the estimates in Browning, Hansen, and Heckman (1999). Values

32:1324:81311:18:18:89:540:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Based on U.S. bankruptcy regulations, we setπ= 7/8 = 0.875 (7 year penalty period)
32:1325:81393:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as the baseline length of penalties. Also, we setγ= 0.1 for the fraction of lost earnings for
32:1326:81486:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individuals who default. Under the GSL program guidelines, defaulting borrowers face an

34:1369:84759:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates are included in our estimates of total schooling expenditures and are reported in

34:1371:84875:18:18:89:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We calibrate the government subsidy ratesas follows.  We assume that the private
34:1372:84955:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:costs of investment are foregone earnings plus a fraction of post-secondary tuition and other
34:1373:85048:18:18:72:539:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:direct costs. Table 333 of theDigest of Education Statistics (2003)reports that tuition and
34:1374:85139:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fees accounted for 20% of total current-fund revenue for degree-granting higher education

34:1378:85493:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schooling. As our baseline, we use a subsidy rate of 54% (i.e.s= 1.19) based on the average
34:1379:85584:18:18:71:539:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:government subsidy rate for individuals completing 2 years of college; however, our results
34:1380:85675:18:18:71:345:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are very similar when we use other reasonable values.

34:1395:86725:18:18:72:488:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the most able are on average about 50% more productive than are the least able.
34:1396:86804:18:18:89:539:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Ideally, we would like to specify a joint distribution of wealth and ability to simulate our
34:1397:86896:18:17:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model and compute the distribution of investment in the economy. Unfortunately, this is
34:1398:86983:17:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not feasible. We do not directly observe the assets available to youth, because they not only
34:1399:87076:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depend on their parents net worth and income but also on intra-family transfers, which are
34:1400:87166:18:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not always observed. Modelling these transfers is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we
34:1401:87259:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analyze investment behavior for our estimated ability types and a range of potential wealth
34:1402:87350:18:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:levels. While we cannot compare moments for investment implied by the model with those
34:1403:87436:22:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:completed schooling when they were ages 16-24 and no longer enrolled in school. Potential work experience
34:1404:87541:12:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:is measured as age - years of completed schooling - 6. The estimates (available upon request) suggest that
34:1405:87647:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:earnings for these young workers are generally increasing in years of completed schooling and increasing and
34:1406:87755:12:0:72:235:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:concave in potential work experience.
35:1407:87794:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observed in the data, we can explore whether investment is increasing in ability and wealth
35:1408:87885:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over reasonable ranges of wealth, how investment behavior depends on the type of constraints
35:1409:87977:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we assume, and how investment and borrowing (as functions of ability and wealth) respond
35:1410:88065:18:18:72:210:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to changes in the economy.
35:1411:88091:18:18:89:539:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because foregone earnings are an important part of investment expenditures in our cal-
35:1412:88177:18:18:72:539:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ibration, an individual’s initial wealth,w, includes at least the amount he could earn if he
35:1413:88269:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:left school after grade 9 and began working. This amount depends on ability, since foregone
35:1414:88360:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earnings depend on ability (see Appendix Table D1). The relevant range of initial wealth,
35:1415:88449:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:therefore, begins at $52,000 for the least able, $74,000 for AFQT quartile 2, and $80–84,000
35:1416:88541:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the top two quartiles. Any wealth levels above these amounts must come from parents
35:1417:88628:18:34:72:197:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or other outside sources.

35:1419:88678:26:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We are primarily interested in the implied cross-sectional relationship between ability, wealth,
35:1420:88774:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and investment in our model with both the GSL and private lenders.  We begin with a

35:1423:89030:18:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model implies a positive relationship between investment and ability given our values for

35:1428:89459:18:17:72:539:373:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:κ≥κ(σ), investment is increasing in ability. Notice,κexceedsκ(σ) for any value ofσunder
35:1429:89546:17:18:71:539:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our baseline parameters.  This is also true if the only penalty for default is a seven-year
35:1430:89637:18:18:71:540:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exclusion from financial markets (π= 7/8, γ= 0) or if the exclusion period lasts only one
35:1431:89726:18:18:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year (π= 1/8) andγ= 0.1. When no penalties for default exist (i.e.π=γ= 0), the limited
35:1432:89812:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:commitment model is equivalent to an exogenous constraint model withd0= 0, and there
35:1433:89896:18:18:72:508:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is only a positive relationship between ability and investment if 0≤σ <1 (IES>1).
35:1434:89977:18:18:89:539:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As discussed earlier, bothκandκ(σ) are increasing inσ. Over most of the empirically

35:1436:90146:18:18:72:487:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the condition in Proposition 6 is met and investment is increasing in ability.
35:1437:90229:18:18:89:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 6 shows the implied borrowing constraints as a function of individual investment

36:1465:91481:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:source is exhausted, they may borrow from private lenders. As one can see, our calibrated
36:1466:91570:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model implies that private borrowing should be negligible during the baseline period (i.e. for
36:1467:91664:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:NLSY79 cohorts). As noted earlier, initial assets for all individuals are at least as high as the
36:1468:91761:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:potential earnings they would receive if they quit school after grade 9: $52,000 for the lowest

38:1528:93596:26:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We now simulate the effects of an increase in the costs of and returns to schooling — two
38:1529:93685:18:17:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:major economic changes that took place between the early 1980s and early 2000s.  We
38:1530:93768:17:18:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aim to see whether the model can reproduce the observed rise in private lending as well
38:1531:93855:18:18:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as the increased effects of family income on educational attainment. We also compare the
38:1532:93943:18:18:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment and consumption allocations under different assumptions about credit markets.
38:1533:94031:18:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This sheds light on the importance of a GSL program for investment, as well as the role
38:1534:94118:18:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:played by private lenders today. We also compare these environments with the standard
38:1535:94203:18:18:72:378:535:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model, which assumes borrowing constraints are exogenous.
38:1536:94260:18:18:89:539:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We model an increase in the wage returns to education by assuming thatαincreases
38:1537:94340:18:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by 0.02 (from the baseline estimate of 0.432).  This change produces a modest increase
38:1538:94426:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the college – high school log wage differential. We model the rise in net tuition costs by
38:1539:94519:18:18:72:539:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assuming that the government subsidy rate,s, falls from 1.19 to 1.05. This reduction reflects
38:1540:94612:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the increased importance of tuition and fees as a fraction of total current-fund revenue for
38:1541:94704:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:public and private universities in the U.S. Finally, we incorporate the stability of maximum
38:1542:94796:18:18:72:435:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:GSL loan limits by assuming thatdmaxremains unchanged at $35,000.
38:1543:94861:18:18:89:539:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 8 graphs the new private lending limits against the unchanged GSL limits. For
38:1544:94945:18:17:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all investment and ability levels, private credit limits increase by at least $3,000 over the
38:1545:95038:17:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline amounts, with much larger increases at higher investment amounts. This increase
38:1546:95126:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is entirely driven by the increased return to investment, which raises the monetary costs of
38:1547:95218:18:18:72:407:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default and, therefore, the amount students can commit to repay.
38:1548:95282:18:18:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Youth wish to borrow more in response to increases in the costs and returns to investment.
38:1549:95372:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:With no increase in credit available from the GSL, private lenders must cover the increased
38:1550:95463:18:18:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand for credit. Indeed, Figure 9 shows that private lending increases substantially. While
38:1551:95556:18:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the least able youth still do not borrow from private lenders, high ability youth with low
38:1552:95646:18:18:72:298:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset levels now borrow as much as $50,000.

38:1560:96257:12:0:72:375:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ranging from $88,000 for the least able to $178,000 for the most able.

40:1616:97564:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:private lending alone, while panel (c) considers the GSL program alone.  In both cases,
40:1617:97651:18:18:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individuals from a much broader range of initial assets and abilities are constrained and
40:1618:97740:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:invest less than in panel (a) when both sources are present. For most initial asset and ability
40:1619:97835:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:levels, the private lending market and GSL yield fairly similar investment levels; however,
40:1620:97926:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this is not true for those with very low initial assets (amounts below potential school-period
40:1621:98020:17:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earnings). Under the GSL, these youth would invest the maximum amount they can borrow,
40:1622:98106:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:$35,000, above the publicly provided amount. Investing less does not provide them with any
40:1623:98196:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more consumption while in school, since they would also be required to borrow less. Private
40:1624:98287:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lenders do not impose this tight restriction, so very poor youth would invest less even though
40:1625:98381:18:18:72:354:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they may be able to borrow more than under the GSL.
40:1626:98432:18:18:89:539:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Notice that both models which incorporate private lending (panels a and b) imply a posi-
40:1627:98520:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tive relationship between ability and investment for all levels of assets; although, investment
40:1628:98615:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is quite similar across ability types for very low asset levels (below potential school-period
40:1629:98709:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earnings). This is not the case for the GSL alone (panel c), since the upper limit on borrow-
40:1630:98802:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing is the binding constraint for a broad range of initial asset levels and ability types. The
40:1631:98896:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:perverse relationship between ability and optimal investment is even worse for the exogenous
40:1632:98988:18:18:72:275:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint model as shown in panel (d).
40:1633:99027:18:18:89:539:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we show consumption during the investment period under all four credit market
40:1634:99113:18:18:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assumptions in Figure 11. Consumption is substantially higher when both the GSL and pri-
40:1635:99201:18:17:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vate lending markets are available than when either is not. As expected from our discussion
40:1636:99292:17:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the GSL program in Section 4, consumption while in school is quite low for those with
40:1637:99380:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:low initial assets. The fact that borrowing cannot be used to finance consumption under the
40:1638:99471:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:GSL can be quite costly for the poor in the absence of private lending. All other forms of
40:1639:99561:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit constraints allow for more intertemporal consumption smoothing, even if it is at the
40:1640:99652:18:0:72:218:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expense of lower investment.

43:1795:100871:30:18:72:540:745:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This paper develops a lifecycle human capital investment model that incorporates the bor-
43:1796:100960:18:18:72:540:727:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rowing opportunities of GSL programs and private lenders who face limited commitment by
43:1797:101047:18:18:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers. Both types of lenders directly link credit to investment behavior, with private
43:1798:101137:18:18:72:540:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lenders further linking credit to observable borrower characteristics that determine invest-
43:1799:101229:18:18:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment productivity. These links are absent in previous models and we show that they play a
43:1800:101318:18:18:72:396:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:central role in determining human capital investment behavior.
43:1801:101380:18:18:89:539:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We draw three broad lessons. First, our model with endogenous borrowing constraints is
43:1802:101466:18:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with empirical studies in that it implies positive effects of both family income and
43:1803:101561:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ability on schooling attainment among constrained borrowers. In contrast, under empirically
43:1804:101652:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plausible assumptions, a standard exogenous constraint model predicts a negative ability –
43:1805:101742:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schooling relationship for constrained borrowers. Second, the direct link between credit and
43:1806:101834:18:17:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment inherent in GSL programs breaks the tradeoff between income maximization and
43:1807:101921:17:18:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption smoothing for some constrained borrowers. As a result, students constrained
43:1808:102008:18:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by GSL limits from borrowing more then they invest will choose to invest the unconstrained
43:1809:102098:18:18:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:optimal amount.  Previous empirical tests based only on educational attainment (or the
43:1810:102184:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal returns on investment) cannot detect this constraint. Third, our model is able to
43:1811:102274:18:18:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reproduce the increased effect of family income on college attendance, the increased fraction
43:1812:102367:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of students borrowing the maximum amount from GSL programs, and the increased student
43:1813:102452:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing from private lenders over the last few decades as an equilibrium response to rising
43:1814:102545:18:18:72:201:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:college costs and returns.
43:1815:102571:18:18:89:539:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It is important to consider both GSL programs and private lenders when modelling hu-
43:1816:102655:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:man capital investment decisions. The features of GSL programs allow for the possibility
43:1817:102743:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that some student borrowers invest the optimal unconstrained amount even if they are con-
43:1818:102832:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:strained. For them, the existence of a private loan market allows for better smoothing of
43:1819:102921:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumption over time. The presence of private lending generates a positive relationship
43:1820:103009:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between ability and investment for individuals from all income backgrounds – a robust em-
43:1821:103098:18:17:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pirical pattern. The co-existence of private and public sources of credit yields some important
43:1822:103193:17:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interactions. First and foremost, investment is higher when both sources are available than
43:1823:103284:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when only one or the other exists. Our quantitative analysis suggests that many more per-
43:1824:103373:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sons would be constrained in the absence of either GSL programs or a private student loan
43:1825:103462:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:market. We also show that private loan limits should depend positively on the better en-
43:1826:103550:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forced GSL credit limits. An increase in GSL loan limits may crowd out some borrowing
43:1827:103635:18:18:72:463:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from private lenders, but it will not cause private lenders to offer less credit.
43:1828:103716:18:18:89:539:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We use an analytically tractable model to show that the main features of GSL programs
43:1829:103801:18:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and private lending under limited commitment are important for explaining observed in-
43:1830:103887:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vestment patterns. An obvious next step is to introduce uncertainty about the returns to
43:1831:103975:18:0:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment. While we do not expect such an extension to alter our predictions about the
44:1832:104064:0:18:72:540:775:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between investment, ability and family resources in any important way, incor-
44:1833:104154:18:18:72:540:757:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:porating uncertainty opens new and interesting areas of inquiry. With uncertainty about
44:1834:104241:18:18:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:labor market success, the option of default provides insurance against adverse outcomes.
44:1835:104329:18:18:72:540:721:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Private lenders and governments must strike a balance between providing this insurance to
44:1836:104418:18:18:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers and enforcing repayment. This defines an interesting optimal lending and enforce-
44:1837:104509:18:18:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment policy, which may be complicated by the fact that students possess private information
44:1838:104600:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about their own abilities or willingness to study. Additionally, the existence of labor market
44:1839:104694:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:uncertainty generally implies default by some agents in equilibrium. This makes it possible
44:1840:104785:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to study which agents are most likely to default and how economic changes and public poli-
44:1841:104875:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cies affect default behavior. We view our framework as a natural starting point for these
44:1842:104964:18:18:72:160:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:types of analysis.
44:1843:104982:18:18:89:539:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We also suggest that future empirical efforts to estimate school-choice models consider
44:1844:105069:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the types of endogenous constraints and punishments we emphasize here.  With reliable
44:1845:105154:18:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data on schooling, borrowing, earnings, and loan repayment (an admittedly tall order),
44:1846:105240:18:17:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:structural estimation may be able to identify more general punishment strategies than we
44:1847:105328:17:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have assumed in this paper. Such an analysis would provide important new insights about
44:1848:105415:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the role of borrowing constraints, who is likely to be constrained, and how higher education
44:1849:105507:18:0:72:439:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policies and economic changes affect schooling and borrowing decisions.

45:1855:105899:16:16:72:165:667:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:21 in both samples.
45:1856:105918:16:16:89:539:651:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:Individuals are considered to have attended college if theyattendedat least 13 years of school

45:1864:106665:16:16:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:during their teenage years as part of the survey process. We categorize individuals according to
45:1865:106761:16:16:72:462:508:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f3:F:their family income, family net wealth (in NLSY97), and AFQT score quartiles.45

45:1867:106935:16:16:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:we control for maternal education by categorizing mothers as high school dropouts, those who
45:1868:107027:16:16:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:completed high school or more, and those who completed at least one year of college. We account
45:1869:107122:16:16:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:for family structure in the NLSY79 by controlling for the number of siblings the youth reported in
45:1870:107220:16:16:72:540:428:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:1979. For the NLSY97, we control for the number of household members under the age of 18 as of
