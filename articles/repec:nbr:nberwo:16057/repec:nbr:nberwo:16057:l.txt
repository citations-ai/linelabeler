2:33:1777:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Segregation has been a recurring social concern throughout human history.  While much progress
2:34:1871:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:has been made to our understanding of the mechanisms driving segregation, work to date has ignored
2:35:1969:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:the role played by location-specific amenities.  Nonetheless, policy remedies for reducing group inequity
2:36:2074:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:often involve place-based investments in minority communities.  In this paper, we introduce an exogenous
2:37:2178:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:location-specific public good into a model of group segregation.  We characterize the equilibria of
2:38:2277:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:the model and derive the comparative statics of improvements to the local public goods.  We show
2:39:2373:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:that the dynamics of neighborhood tipping depend on the levels of public goods.  We also show that
2:40:2471:14:42:72:453:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:investments in low-public good communities can actually increase segregation.

3:68:3441:27:20:72:538:509:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Racial segregation of one form or another has been a recurring social concern throughout human 
3:69:3536:20:21:72:533:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:history.  In the United States, much has changed since Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka 
3:70:3629:21:21:72:540:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended de jure racial segregation.  But despite the improvements 
3:71:3726:21:21:72:534:447:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in black educational achievement, the narrowing of black-white income gaps, and even the elec-
3:72:3820:21:20:72:526:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tion of the first African-American President, de facto racial segregation continues to be one of 
3:73:3917:20:27:72:278:406:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the country’s most prevalent social issues. 
3:74:3961:27:21:108:541:379:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Addressing this important topic, economists have explored the social mechanisms driving 
3:75:4049:21:20:72:540:358:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:segregation.  Schelling (1969, 1971) and Pancs and Vriend (2007) have shown that the dynamics 
3:76:4143:20:21:72:526:338:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of neighborhood "tipping" can force segregated outcomes even when there are tastes for some 
3:77:4235:21:21:72:533:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:degree of integration.  More recently, Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008) have shown that, empiri-
3:78:4330:21:20:72:536:296:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cally, white households flee neighborhoods once they become 5-20% minority.  Consistent with 
3:79:4423:20:21:72:533:276:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:this phenomenon, Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor (1999) and Kiel and Zabel (1996) find that white 
3:80:4517:21:21:72:512:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:communities do command a price premium in part precisely because of their whiteness.  In 
3:81:4606:21:21:72:527:234:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:related work, Hoff and Sen (2005) and Sethi and Somanathan (2004) show how positive exter-
3:82:4696:21:20:72:542:213:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nalities from the activities of richer households can impact community composition.  At the same 
3:83:4793:20:21:72:529:193:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:time, Bayer, Fang, and McMillan (2005) and Sethi and Somanathan (2004) show that reducing 
3:84:4883:21:21:72:525:172:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:income inequality between groups can actually increase group segregation, because richer mi-
3:85:4975:21:26:72:418:151:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:norities need no longer join whites to live in high-income communities. 
3:86:5047:26:21:108:529:125:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:While this rich literature has made significant contributions to our understanding of the 
3:87:5137:21:0:72:537:104:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:equilibrium properties of segregation, it has almost completely ignored the role played by public 
4:88:5237:0:20:71:518:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:goods and/or location-specific amenities in the process of segregation.1  This is an important 
4:89:5332:20:21:72:540:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:shortcoming because, as the above epigraph illustrates, many of the policy remedies for reducing 
4:90:5429:21:21:72:529:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:group inequity focus specifically on investments in minority communities.  Investments in edu-
4:91:5523:21:20:72:531:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cation are only one example.  In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
4:92:5615:20:21:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ment (HUD) provides Community Development Block Grants (totaling $125B since 1974); the 
4:93:5703:21:21:72:514:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:US EPA's Superfund and Brownfields programs clean up contaminated sites and encourage 
4:94:5789:21:20:72:517:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:redevelopment; enterprise zones provide tax incentives for businesses; and the 1992 Federal 
4:95:5881:20:21:72:535:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act steers Fannie and Freddie investments 
4:96:5974:21:21:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to low-income and minority communities.  Clearly, such place-based interventions play a central 
4:97:6070:21:27:71:405:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:role in efforts to address social concerns associated with segregation. 
4:98:6142:27:20:107:522:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:In this paper, we advance the literature by introducing an exogenous location-specific 
4:99:6229:20:21:72:515:475:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public good (to be manipulated by public policy) into a model of group segregation.  In this 
4:100:6322:21:21:71:536:454:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sense, we combine features of the segregation and public goods literatures.2  First, following the 
4:101:6421:21:20:72:524:433:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tradition of Schelling (1969, 1971), we consider preferences for the endogenous demographic 
4:102:6513:20:21:71:514:413:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:make-up of the community.3  Second, following the tradition of Tiebout (1956), we include 
4:103:6603:21:21:72:535:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:heterogeneity in willingness to pay for public goods.  In particular, we adapt a model of vertical-
4:104:6702:21:20:72:521:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ly differentiated communities from Epple, Filimon, and Romer (1984), a model used in other 
4:105:6793:20:27:72:463:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:recent and related work (Banzhaf and Walsh 2008, Sethi and Somanathan 2004). 
4:106:6870:27:21:108:531:324:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We combine these two traditions into a general equilibrium model in which households 
4:107:6955:21:20:72:543:303:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:choose a community based on both its endogenous demographics and its exogenous public good.  
4:108:7048:20:29:72:534:283:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We then characterize the equilibria of such a model and derive the comparative statics of policy 
4:109:7145:29:13:216:219:254:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
4:110:7193:13:16:72:528:241:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:1 An important exception is Becker and Murphy (2000).  Using several compelling examples, they point out how, 
4:111:7303:16:12:72:529:225:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:even in a very simple model, the presence of an exogenous amenity can radically change the demographic sorting 
4:112:7414:12:11:72:531:213:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:dynamics.  In this paper, we extend that theme, characterizing the way exogenous public goods and demographics 
4:113:7525:11:13:72:231:202:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:interact under more general conditions. 
4:114:7565:13:16:72:523:189:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:2 Glaeser and Scheinkman (2003) show how these two models can be nested in a more general social interaction 
4:115:7674:16:13:71:101:173:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:model. 
4:116:7681:13:16:72:532:160:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:3 Throughout our analysis a fundamental assumption is that individuals of a given type tend toward living together 
4:117:7796:16:12:71:512:144:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:due to preferences to live with individuals of their own type.  We note, though, that identical results would be 
4:118:7909:12:11:71:537:132:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:obtained if the model assumed that concentrations of individuals of a given type lead to social spillovers that dispro-
4:119:8028:11:12:71:536:121:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:portionately benefit that type (i.e. concentrations of businesses, community networks, restaurants, non-profit servic-
4:120:8146:12:0:71:107:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:es, etc.). 
5:121:8159:0:20:71:532:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:shocks to the local public goods.  The model generates several results regarding the importance 
5:122:8255:20:21:71:528:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of place-based amenities.  First, we establish that, even when sorting is driven by tastes for the 
5:123:8354:21:21:71:533:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:exogenous public good and not by demographic tastes, some racial segregation will result, with 
5:124:8449:21:20:71:523:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the richer group enjoying higher levels of the public good.  Second, we show that introducing 
5:125:8543:20:21:71:529:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tastes for endogenous demographic composition can drive further segregation, as suggested by 
5:126:8636:21:21:71:533:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Schelling's "tipping model."  By the same token, we show that differences in public good levels 
5:127:8732:21:20:71:526:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:can alter the responses to demographic composition.  Such dynamics may explain some of the 
5:128:8823:20:21:71:519:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:variation that Card, Mas and Rothstein (2008) observe in their empirical estimates of tipping 
5:129:8917:21:21:71:523:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:points in U.S. Cities.  As a pragmatic matter, this increased segregation is likely to further the 
5:130:9016:21:21:71:537:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differences in the average level of the public good enjoyed by the two groups.  Finally, we show 
5:131:9113:21:20:71:511:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that place-based interventions that improve the public good in a low-quality, high-minority 
5:132:9205:20:21:71:514:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:community may actually increase group segregation, as richer minorities are more likely to 
5:133:9296:21:21:71:537:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:migrate into the community following the improvement.  Essentially, when differences in public 
5:134:9391:21:20:71:531:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:goods become less important, group-based sorting begins to dominate income-based sorting on 
5:135:9483:20:27:71:152:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the public good. 
5:136:9500:27:21:107:531:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:In the final section of the paper, we use large changes in the distribution of air pollution 
5:137:9593:21:20:71:513:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:from industrial facilities that occurred in California between 1990 and 2000 to illustrate the 
5:138:9688:20:21:71:527:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:predictions of the model.  Consistent with our model’s predictions, we find that large scale im-

5:142:9920:26:21:71:534:256:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:In this section, we develop a model of the links between race, demographic composition, public 
5:143:10015:21:21:71:537:235:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:goods, and location choice.  In the recent literature, the model is most similar to work by Becker 
5:144:10114:21:20:71:525:214:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and Murphy (2000), Sethi and Somanathan (2004) and Banzhaf and Walsh (2008), but differs 
5:145:10203:20:21:71:514:194:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:from these papers in several important respects.  It resembles Becker and Murphy (2000) in 
5:146:10294:21:21:71:523:173:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:combining preferences for an exogenous public good with the endogenous demographic com-
5:147:10381:21:20:71:522:152:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:munity, but differs in going beyond their simple 2-person model to incorporate continuous in-
5:148:10474:20:21:71:534:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:come distributions and heterogeneity in the willingness to pay for amenities.  Generalizing their 
5:149:10572:21:0:71:522:111:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:model in this way is crucial for evaluating income-based segregation.  Our model also differs 
6:150:10668:0:20:71:520:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:from theirs in that each group prefers to be with their own type, rather than a particular "high 
6:151:10765:20:21:71:526:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type."  At the same time, our model resembles Sethi and Somanathan (2004) and Banzhaf and 
6:152:10855:21:21:71:528:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Walsh (2008) in adapting the vertically differentiated framework of Epple et al. (1984).  But it 
6:153:10952:21:20:71:521:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differs from Banzhaf and Walsh (2008), who only consider the exogenous good, in including 
6:154:11042:20:21:71:539:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:racial groups and demographic preferences.  And it differs from Sethi and Somanathan (2004) in 
6:155:11137:21:21:71:526:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:including an exogenous public good.4  Including this public good is obviously essential to ana-

6:157:11291:27:27:72:162:557:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:2.1  Model Basics 
6:158:11309:27:21:108:535:530:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We consider a model with two communities, j  {C1, C2}, each composed of an identic-
6:159:11392:21:22:72:525:509:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:al set of fixed-size housing stock with measure 0.5.  The price of this fixed housing unit is Pj.  
6:160:11491:22:21:72:525:487:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Residents of these communities comprise two demographic types, r  {b, w}.  Type b, the mi-
6:161:11581:21:21:72:527:466:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nority, has measure β < 0.5 and type w has measure (1-β).  One obvious interpretation of these 
6:162:11676:21:20:72:499:445:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:types is as racial groups (w for white and b for blacks). However, in principle they could 
6:163:11767:20:27:72:394:425:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:represent any pair of groups with the minority group being poorer. 
6:164:11834:27:21:108:517:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:There is heterogeneity in income Y within each type, which is described by the conti-
6:165:11919:21:20:72:522:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nuous distribution functions Fr(Y).  We impose the following two assumptions on the income 
6:166:12010:20:33:72:271:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:distributions of type b and w individuals:

6:174:12167:40:21:72:541:216:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The first condition requires that the population of type-w individuals is richer than the population 
6:175:12268:21:21:71:516:195:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of type-b individuals in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.  The second condition 
6:176:12362:21:35:71:534:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:limits the difference in income distributions between the two groups.  In particular, it states that 
6:177:12463:35:14:216:219:139:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
6:178:12511:14:16:72:541:125:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:4 We also provide a more general characterization of the equilibria of our model, including integrated and segregated 
6:179:12629:16:0:71:361:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:equilibria.  Sethi and Somanathan (2004) focus on integrated equilibria. 
7:180:12704:0:26:71:513:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:some positive measure of each group falls in the top half of the pooled income distribution. 
7:181:12797:26:21:108:537:682:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Each individual is assumed to consume one unit of housing and to have preferences over 
7:182:12884:21:21:71:540:661:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:a numeraire good x (with a price set to unity), an exogenous community public good level Gj and 
7:183:12980:21:23:71:519:640:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:endogenous community demographic composition.  Tastes for demographic composition are 
7:184:13066:23:22:71:538:617:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:captured by ܦ௥௝ܦൌ௥ܱܴܲܲ൫௥௝൯, where ܱܴܲܲ௥௝ is the proportion of residents in community j who 
7:185:13156:22:21:72:530:595:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:are of type r.  Individuals of each type experience the same service flow from the public good.  
7:186:13253:21:20:71:534:574:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:However, they view the demographic composition differently, so D is indexed by type r as well

7:189:13454:21:34:72:166:506:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:en by equation (3):

7:191:13514:35:23:72:533:437:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The function U(·) is continuous and increasing at a decreasing rate in both of its arguments, and

7:193:13704:22:21:72:539:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:simply income net of housing costs.  We impose the Inada condition that ܷ௫՜∞ as ՜0ݔ.  We 
7:194:13793:21:27:71:281:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:also impose the following condition on ܦ௥:

7:198:13911:27:21:72:517:263:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:This condition guarantees that when ܩଵܩൌଶ, for any feasible sorting, each type prefers the 
7:199:14002:21:20:72:543:242:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:community with more of its own type.  For example, if β=0.25, the condition requires that type-w 
7:200:14098:20:21:72:534:222:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:individuals prefer an all-w community to a community with less than 50% w and type-b individ-
7:201:14191:21:21:72:522:201:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:uals prefer a community that is more than 50% type b to an all-w community.  This condition 
7:202:14283:21:21:72:522:180:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:does not imply that preferences are monotonic.  To the contrary, in general this assumption is 
7:203:14378:21:23:72:527:159:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:consistent with a wide range of preferences including for example any symmetric "bliss point"

7:205:14553:21:0:72:535:115:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:this restriction is not necessary for solving the model, we restrict the preference domain to these 
8:206:14655:0:20:71:524:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cases because they are consistent with US racial preferences previously estimated in the litera-

8:210:14940:21:21:72:538:619:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:we are working with an assignment model, to close the model we normalize the price of housing

8:226:15823:26:21:108:531:291:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The structure of the model allows us to simplify the characterization of the sorting of in-

8:229:16104:22:23:72:523:227:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:housing, implies that within each type preferences satisfy the "single crossing" property in ܲ௝

8:232:16345:13:16:72:530:160:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:5 In particular, the survey literature suggests that the appropriate levels for ρw and ρb are around 0.9 and 0.5 respec-

9:248:17793:27:21:107:535:424:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To provide intuition about the equilibrium properties of the model, we begin by working 
9:249:17881:21:20:71:533:403:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:through a four-step process for evaluating the potential for different demographic sortings to be 
9:250:17979:20:21:71:517:383:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:supported as equilibria.  In this section, we also build intuition by working with one specific 
9:251:18075:21:27:71:118:362:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:example. 
9:252:18084:27:21:107:529:335:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:In the first step, we note that the entire demographic profile of a given sorting of house-
9:253:18175:21:21:71:528:314:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:holds can be expressed solely as a function of ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ, the proportion of Community 1 that is 
9:254:18269:21:21:72:536:293:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type w.  In particular, if one knows the proportion of Community 1 that is type w, the proportion

10:271:19220:34:20:72:541:635:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We graph these relationships in Panel 1 of Figure 1.  Given the requirement that housing markets

10:278:19789:21:23:72:531:472:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:point preferences over demographic composition.  In particular, the figure illustrates results for

10:280:19985:21:21:72:522:428:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and G, and D is defined by a quadratic function around a bliss point ρ, with type w preferring 
10:281:20080:21:21:72:534:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:more segregation.  (As noted above, this parameterization of Dr is consistent with previous find-
10:282:20177:21:20:71:526:386:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ings for racial attitudes and in the US.)  The utility function U(·) is Cobb-Douglas in consump-

10:286:20464:27:21:108:537:297:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The figure shows that, for this example, the utility received by type w in C1 is increasing 
10:287:20556:21:21:72:519:276:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ up to the bliss point at 0.9, at which point it begins to fall.  Type-w's utility in C2 
10:288:20654:21:21:72:529:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:likewise is increasing in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ up to the same bliss point, but this is mapped in the figure as 
10:289:20752:21:22:72:541:234:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f3:B:being decreasing in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ up to the bliss point where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.6 (which is where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ 
10:290:20845:22:21:71:526:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:= 0.9).  On the other hand, type-b utility in C1 is decreasing in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ while type-b utility in 
10:291:20943:21:21:72:542:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:B:C2 is increasing in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ.  In this example, since β=0.25, type b is always below its bliss point 
10:292:21043:21:20:72:535:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of 0.5.  Note that even with these bliss point preferences, both types always prefer the communi-

10:294:21234:21:21:71:522:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:graphic preferences and the set of feasible profiles identified in Panel 1.  Finally, note that be-

11:296:21426:0:27:71:317:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:are identical, which occurs where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.75. 
11:297:21475:27:21:108:541:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:In the third step, we identify the boundary incomes associated with the sorting implied by 
11:298:21566:21:21:72:540:660:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:each value of ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ.  These boundary incomes are a function of the utility values computed in 
11:299:21662:21:22:71:522:639:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the previous step and the income distributions.  For example, suppose β=0.25 and ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ is 
11:300:21754:22:21:71:530:617:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:0.6.  By Equation 5, ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ is 0.9.  In turn, it follows that 2/5 of type w are in Community 1.  
11:301:21852:21:25:72:525:596:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Suppose further that with ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.6, the values of Gj imply that type w individuals prefer

11:366:22464:53:20:108:519:158:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Panel 3 shows, for our example, the boundary incomes as a function of ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ.  Be-
11:367:22547:20:22:71:504:138:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cause this example uses uniform income distributions, the boundary incomes are linear in

12:369:22729:0:20:71:530:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:single-crossing implies that they will sort such that the richest type-w individuals locate in C2.  
12:370:22829:20:21:71:532:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Consequently, the boundary income is that of the poorest type-w individual in C2 (alternatively

12:372:23022:21:21:72:530:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type-w individuals living in C2 must decrease.  Thus, the boundary income must increase.  But

12:375:23302:21:20:72:515:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Because in this example the community switch occurs where type-w individuals are equally 
12:376:23391:20:21:71:522:562:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:distributed between the two communities, the boundary income function is continuous with a

12:380:23712:26:21:108:538:472:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:While the boundary income function for type b looks similar to that of the type w, the un-
12:381:23802:21:21:72:530:451:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:derlying process is different.  When ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ is below 1-β, type-b individuals prefer Communi-

12:383:23989:21:21:71:503:409:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:individual in C1 (alternatively the richest type-b individual in C2).  At the extreme, when

12:385:24157:27:27:108:469:361:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Based on the discussion to this point, we make the following observations. 
12:386:24232:27:13:108:536:334:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Observation 1.  Some type-w individuals always live in both communities.  This must be 
12:387:24319:13:14:107:541:321:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:the case because the measure of type-w individuals is greater than 0.5.  More specifically, 
12:388:24411:14:14:108:529:307:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:the share of type w in any community can never fall below 1-2β.  In contrast, all type-b 
12:389:24499:14:26:108:392:293:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:individuals can reside in only one of the two communities. 
12:390:24558:26:15:108:527:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Observation 2.  When VwC1 ≠ VwC2, there is some ܻത௪ at which type-w individuals are in-
12:391:24643:15:14:108:530:252:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:different.  All type-w individuals with income higher than ܻത௪ will reside in the more de-
12:392:24733:14:14:108:530:238:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:sirable (to w) community and poorer type-w individuals will live in the community that 
12:393:24820:14:14:108:471:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:type-w individuals find less desirable.  Moreover, ܻത௪ can never drop below

12:396:24990:26:14:108:533:169:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Observation 3.  The community that type w perceives as more desirable will be more ex-
12:397:25076:14:14:108:533:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:pensive:  VwC2 ≥ VwC1 ↔ PC2 ≥ 0.  This relationship must hold.  Otherwise, every type w 
12:398:25158:14:14:108:537:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:individual would prefer to live in the community with higher Vw and lower price, and the 
12:399:25247:14:0:108:514:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:demand for housing would exceed supply in that community.  Further, PC2 = ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ. 
13:400:25332:0:20:71:513:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:These observations are general to the model and do not depend on the specific assumptions 
13:401:25422:20:27:71:290:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:underlying the example depicted in Figure 1. 
13:402:25467:27:21:107:533:661:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:As noted in Observation 1, because β<0.5, it is possible for all type-b individuals to live 
13:403:25559:21:20:71:537:640:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in the same community.  We will refer to equilibria where all type-b individuals live in the same 
13:404:25657:20:21:71:533:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:community as "segregated" and equilibria where some type-b individuals live in both communi-
13:405:25749:21:27:71:460:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ties as "integrated."  We make the following observations about these two cases. 
13:406:25830:27:14:107:531:572:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Observation 4.  For segregation of types with all type-b individuals locating in C1 to be 
13:407:25920:14:15:108:520:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:supportable as an equilibrium, it must be the case that ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ ≤ ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ.  (Otherwise, if

13:409:26092:16:16:108:538:527:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:individual for housing in C2.)  In particular, if VbC2 > VbC1 and VwC2 > VwC1, then ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ ≥ 
13:410:26183:16:16:108:528:511:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f3:A:݀݅ܤ௒ത್ > 0.  If VbC1 > VbC2 and VwC2 > VwC1 then ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ > 0 > ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  And if VbC1 > VbC2 
13:411:26271:16:17:107:539:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:and VwC1 > VwC2, then 0 > ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ ≥ ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  Note also that if VbC1 > VbC2, then ܻത௕ = ܻ௕M୧୬ = 
13:412:26363:17:14:108:541:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:0.  Otherwise, ܻത௕ = ܻ௕Mୟ୶.  The opposite and symmetric cases hold for equilibria where all 
13:413:26455:14:26:108:261:464:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:type-b individuals locate in C2. 
13:414:26488:26:14:108:535:438:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Observation 5.  In any integrated equilibrium, both types must agree on which communi-
13:415:26574:14:16:108:540:424:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:ty is more desirable, and ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ = ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  Additionally, some members of each type must 
13:416:26663:16:17:107:512:408:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:be willing to pay to live in the more desirable community (ܻ௕M୧୬ < ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ = ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ <

13:418:26755:26:20:108:534:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The upshot of these observations is that equilibria can be identified by an analysis of the 
13:419:26847:20:22:72:530:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bids of individuals at the boundary incomes.  We use the term "boundary income bid function" 
13:420:26940:22:20:72:521:323:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:for the mapping from ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ to these bids.  Note that the boundary income bid function for 
13:421:27032:20:21:72:530:303:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type r is not the willingness to pay function for a specific individual, but a bid function over an 
13:422:27132:21:27:72:454:282:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:endogenous income level (the boundary incomes associated with each sorting). 
13:423:27209:27:21:107:530:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:If at any integrated allocation the two groups' boundary income bid functions are equal, 
13:424:27298:21:23:72:542:234:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f1:B:݀݅ܤ௒തೢ = ݀݅ܤ௒ത್, then that integrated allocation can be supported as an equilibrium.  Alternatively,

14:446:27979:21:22:72:540:606:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:expression shows two effects.  The first term inside the brackets captures the effect of the change

14:448:28173:20:22:72:515:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the brackets captures the effect of changes in the V(·) function that are associated with an in-
14:449:28269:22:26:71:165:542:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:crease in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ. 
14:450:28288:26:21:108:538:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Panel 4 of Figure 1 plots the boundary income bid functions associated with the previous-
14:451:28377:21:21:72:532:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ly defined example.  Recall from the second step that, because the G's are equal in the two com-
14:452:28473:21:21:72:517:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:munities, when ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.75 the demographic compositions are identical as well, so both 
14:453:28563:21:21:71:531:453:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:groups are indifferent between communities at that point.  Accordingly, Panel 4 shows that, for 
14:454:28659:21:28:72:434:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:each type, the boundary income bid function is zero when ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.75. 
14:455:28732:28:21:108:539:404:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Type-w individuals prefer Community 2 when ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ < 0.75, so the bid function is pos-
14:456:28818:21:21:71:523:383:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:itive.  Conversely, when ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ > 0.75, type-w individuals prefer Community 1 and the bid 
14:457:28909:21:21:72:541:362:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:function is negative.  Using Equation (10), we find that the type-w boundary income bid function 
14:458:29006:21:21:72:526:341:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:is monotonically decreasing in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ for this example.  This relationship arises because the 
14:459:29101:21:21:71:534:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:utility effect of changes in ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ, shown in the second term of Equation (10), is negative and 
14:460:29198:21:21:72:538:299:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:always dominates the boundary income effect, shown in the first term of Equation (10), which is 
14:461:29294:21:26:71:115:278:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:positive. 
14:462:29304:26:22:107:530:252:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:For type-b individuals, preferences for the communities are the reverse of those of type-
14:463:29393:22:20:72:528:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:B:w.  The bid function is always negative for ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ < 0.75 and always positive for ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ > 
14:464:29486:20:22:71:528:210:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:0.75.  In terms of the slope of the bid function, the basic dynamics are the same as with type-w 
14:465:29582:22:20:71:530:188:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:individuals, except that for very low or very high levels of ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ the change associated with 
14:466:29678:20:22:72:529:168:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the boundary income dominates the change associated with closing the gap in V(·).  This result 
14:467:29773:22:20:72:523:146:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differs from that for type-w individuals because of the steeper slope of ܻ݀ത௕/ܱܴܲܲ݀ ௪஼ଵ, which 
14:468:29868:20:0:72:355:126:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:arises from the fact that there are fewer type-b individuals. 
15:469:29933:0:20:107:527:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Evaluating the figure, we can see that this example has three equilibria.  At the far left, 
15:470:30025:20:21:71:535:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type-w individuals are willing to pay to live in Community 2, type-b individuals are not, and C2 
15:471:30121:21:21:71:526:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:is all-w.  At the far right is the opposite and symmetric segregated equilibrium.  In the middle, 
15:472:30219:21:20:71:539:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:there is an integrated equilibrium in which the two communities have the same composition, and 
15:473:30314:20:27:71:430:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:all individuals of both types are indifferent between the two communities. 
15:474:30389:27:27:71:384:599:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:2.3  Characterizing the equilibria and their comparative statics 
15:475:30454:27:20:107:534:572:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We now characterize the equilibria and comparative statics of the model.  We first estab-
15:476:30543:20:27:71:285:552:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:lish the existence of equilibria in the model. 
15:477:30590:27:14:107:181:525:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Proposition 1. 
15:478:30605:14:14:107:539:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:For preference functions and income distributions satisfying conditions (1) through (3) in 
15:479:30696:14:20:107:539:497:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Section 2.1, there is at least one allocation that satisfies equilibrium conditions E.1 to E3. 
15:480:30791:20:14:107:148:477:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:A:Proof.   
15:481:30800:14:14:107:532:463:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Consider the sorting at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β.  (This is the point where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ = 1 and is de-
15:482:30888:14:16:108:538:449:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:picted as the left-hand side of Panel 4 in Figure 1).  At this point either ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ ≤ ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ or 
15:483:30981:16:16:108:521:433:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f1:A:݀݅ܤ௒ത್ > ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ.  In the former case this point represents a segregated equilibrium and 
15:484:31069:16:14:108:527:417:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:thus existence is trivial.  Consider now the sorting at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1.  Again, at this point 
15:485:31160:14:15:108:503:403:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:either ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ ≤ ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ or ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ > ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  And again, in the former case, this point 
15:486:31244:15:14:108:506:388:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:represents a segregated equilibrium.  Finally, we must consider the possibility that 
15:487:31329:14:16:108:531:374:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f1:A:݀݅ܤ௒ത್ > ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β and ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ > ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1.  But in this case, 
15:488:31418:16:14:107:504:358:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:by continuity, the boundary income bid functions must cross at some point, where 
15:489:31499:14:27:107:328:344:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f1:A:݀݅ܤ௒തೢ = ݀݅ܤ௒ത್, which is also an equilibrium. 
15:490:31546:27:21:108:519:317:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:In addition to the existence of such equilibria, we are also concerned with stability of 
15:491:31635:21:27:72:377:296:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:equilibria.  We adopt the following definition of local stability.

15:498:31887:32:14:108:522:186:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:An equilibrium is locally stable if there exists a ,ߜ such that for any 4-tuple of epsilon

16:502:32204:21:21:108:529:671:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Essentially, this definition requires that when a small set of "almost indifferent" type-w 
16:503:32294:21:20:71:532:650:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:individuals in one community switch with a small set of "almost indifferent" type-b individuals 
16:504:32390:20:21:71:510:630:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in the other community, they prefer to switch back.  It insures that individuals moved from 
16:505:32482:21:21:71:537:609:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Community 2 will outbid the individuals moved from Community 1; thus reversing the perturba-
16:506:32574:21:20:71:510:588:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tion and restoring the initial equilibrium.  When this condition is not met, an equilibrium is 
16:507:32669:20:21:71:515:568:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:unstable and the perturbation causes the communities to tip toward segregation (or toward a 
16:508:32761:21:27:71:232:547:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:different integrated equilibrium). 
16:509:32796:27:21:107:530:520:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:As discussed above, equilibria occur either at corners (the case of segregation) or in the 
16:510:32887:21:20:71:529:499:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:interior (the case of integration).  Whenever corner equilibria exist, they will be locally stable.  
16:511:32988:20:21:71:528:479:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:For interior solutions, it is straightforward to demonstrate that the local stability conditions are 
16:512:33089:21:21:71:541:458:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:satisfied whenever the type-b boundary income bid function crosses the type-w boundary income

16:526:33754:14:16:72:536:251:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:9 The proof follows the logic of Proposition 1, and we sketch it briefly.  Consider the sorting at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β and 
16:527:33872:16:13:72:529:235:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:consider two cases.  In case 1, ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ ≤ ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ and this is a stable equilibrium (with C2 all-w).  Consider three sub-
16:528:33988:13:11:72:538:222:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:cases.  (1a) If the bid functions never cross, then this is the only equilibrium.  (1b) If the bid functions cross an even 
16:529:34111:11:12:72:524:211:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:number of times, there is only the one segregated equilibrium plus the even integrated equilibria, totaling an odd 
16:530:34226:12:11:72:531:199:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:number of equilibria.  In addition, half the integrated equilibria will occur with type-b's boundary income bid func-
16:531:34343:11:12:72:527:188:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:tion cutting type-w's from above, indicating stability.  Thus, (n+1)/2  are stable.  (1c) If the bid functions cross an 
16:532:34463:12:13:72:529:176:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:odd number of times, there will be a second segregated equilibrium at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1, with ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ ≤ ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  That is, 
16:533:34576:13:12:71:512:163:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:there will be an odd number of integrated equilibria plus two segregated equilibria, totaling an odd number of 
16:534:34687:12:11:71:541:151:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:equilibria.  In addition, if there are m integrated equilibria, (m-1)/2 will be stable.  With ൅2݉ൌ݊, this means there 
16:535:34805:11:12:71:541:140:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:will be (n+1)/2 stable equilibria again.  Though we omit them for brevity, these sub-cases can be repeated for case 2, 
16:536:34924:12:13:71:333:128:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:where ݀݅ܤ௒ത್൐ ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ at ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β, to complete the proof. 
16:537:34986:13:12:71:534:115:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:     Note here the importance of the notion of the "regular" economy.  Without it, there may be additional equilibria 
16:538:35104:12:0:71:522:103:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:where the two groups' boundary income bid functions are just tangent, or even an interval of equilibria.  Debreu

17:541:35408:21:27:71:464:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:satisfying the general preferences in Section 2.1, the following proposition holds. 
17:542:35492:27:14:107:182:640:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:A:Proposition 2. 
17:543:35506:14:14:107:519:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Whenever ܩ஼ଵܩൌ஼ଶ, there will be three equilibria:  two stable segregated equilibria 
17:544:35590:14:14:108:531:612:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:with ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ  = 1 and ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β, respectively, and one unstable integrated equili-

17:546:35702:26:26:107:234:572:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Proof:  See the appendix. 
17:547:35727:26:20:71:540:546:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:When there are no differences in the public good, individuals sort solely based on demographics, 
17:548:35824:20:27:71:190:526:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:resulting in segregation. 
17:549:35850:27:21:107:539:499:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We now turn to an analysis of cases where public good levels differ across communities.  
17:550:35939:21:20:71:537:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:To build intuition for how relationships change when public goods differ, Figure 2 replicates the 
17:551:36037:20:21:71:543:458:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:example from Figure 1 but now for a case with unequal public good levels (GC1=0.9 and GC2=1).  
17:552:36132:21:21:71:532:437:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Because the set of feasible demographic compositions is independent of public good levels, the 
17:553:36227:21:21:71:540:416:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:first panel of Figure 2 is identical to Figure 1.  Comparing Panel 2 in Figure 2 to Figure 1 reveals 
17:554:36328:21:21:71:515:395:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that when ܩ஼ଵ falls, ܸ௥஼ଵ shifts down for both types.  As a result, type-b individuals are now 
17:555:36423:21:22:71:540:374:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:indifferent between the two communities when ܱܴܲܲ ௪஼ଵ = 0.65 (instead of at .75 in the previous 
17:556:36519:22:20:72:540:352:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:case where ܩ஼ଵܩൌ஼ଶ).  For type-w individuals the indifference point is now at ܱܴܲܲ ௪஼ଵ = 0.92 
17:557:36613:20:27:71:238:332:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(versus 0.90 in the previous case). 
17:558:36649:27:21:107:529:305:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Panel 3 shows the impact of the differential public good levels on the boundary income 
17:559:36736:21:21:71:534:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:functions.  When public goods were equated across communities, both types were indifferent at 
17:560:36830:21:21:71:538:263:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the point where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ.  As a result, even though relative preferences for communi-
17:561:36924:21:21:72:538:242:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ties switch at this point, reversing the income sorting, the boundary income functions were conti-
17:562:37022:21:20:72:517:221:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nuous (though kinked) at the indifference point.  Differential public good levels separate the 
17:563:37117:20:39:72:526:201:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:indifference point for the two types moving them away from equal sorting.  Consequently, the

17:565:37366:18:12:72:529:144:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:(1970) shows that the equilibria in an Arrow-Debreu economy are regular "almost everywhere" in the set of prefe-
17:566:37478:12:11:72:523:132:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:rence parameters and income distributions.  Although a proof is beyond the scope of this paper, reasoning analo-
17:567:37590:11:12:72:515:121:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:gously it seems likely that the set of parameters that would generate irregular sorting have measure zero in the 
17:568:37703:12:0:72:415:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:parameter space.  Certainly, we have never found an example with irregular sortings. 
18:569:37791:0:26:71:488:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:boundary income functions now have a discontinuity at each type's indifference point. 
18:570:37877:26:21:107:525:682:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Finally, Panel 4 of Figure 2 presents the boundary income bid functions under the new 
18:571:37963:21:21:71:524:661:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public good levels.  In spite of the discontinuity in boundary incomes, The boundary bid func-
18:572:38057:21:20:71:526:640:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tions are continuous at this point.  This continuity, which will always hold, occurs because the 
18:573:38154:20:21:71:534:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bid function at the point of indifference is by definition equal to zero and approaches zero conti-
18:574:38253:21:21:71:537:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nuously from both sides. In terms of potential equilibria, the model remains qualitatively similar 
18:575:38352:21:20:71:535:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to the case where the public good levels were equal.  There are still two stable segregated equili-
18:576:38451:20:22:71:529:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bria and one unstable integrated equilibrium, with the location of the unstable integrated equili-
18:577:38549:22:20:71:531:536:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:brium now shifted slightly to the right to where ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 0.76.  Thus, for small differences in 
18:578:38646:20:21:72:531:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public good levels, it is possible to support a segregated equilibrium with all type-b individuals 
18:579:38745:21:21:72:536:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in the high public good community.  However, comparison of the bid functions in Figures 1 and 
18:580:38839:21:21:72:536:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:2 suggest that, at least for this example, if the public good gap were to increase further, then this 
18:581:38941:21:26:72:517:453:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:equilibrium will no longer be supported.  As we shall see below, this result holds in general. 
18:582:39036:26:21:107:536:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:As the public good gap increases, it becomes difficult to make general statements regard-
18:583:39125:21:21:71:538:406:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ing the character of equilibria.  As is clear from an examination of Equation 10, the slopes of the 
18:584:39225:21:20:71:528:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bid functions are highly sensitive to local variations in the density of the income functions and 
18:585:39323:20:21:71:520:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the relative curvatures of the utility functions.  For instance, it is relatively straightforward to 
18:586:39424:21:21:71:525:344:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:generate examples with multiple segregated and multiple stable and unstable integrated equili-
18:587:39518:21:26:72:363:323:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bria when the public good differentials are moderate in size. 
18:588:39580:26:21:108:520:297:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Nevertheless, the model does provide sharp predictions regarding equilibria for cases 
18:589:39666:21:21:72:526:276:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with "small" or "large" differences in public goods, and a comparison of these two polar cases 
18:590:39761:21:21:72:532:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:provides important policy insights.  We begin by considering the case with small differences in 
18:591:39857:21:20:71:527:234:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the public goods levels.  As stated in Proposition 2, the case where the level of public goods is 
18:592:39955:20:22:72:536:214:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the same in each community always has one unstable integrated equilibrium and two symmetric 
18:593:40047:22:21:72:523:192:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:stable segregated equilibria.  This proposition extends to a measure of ܩ௝ as stated in Proposi-
18:594:40143:21:26:72:106:171:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tion 3.

18:596:40165:15:0:108:518:130:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:A:For any given level of ܩ஼ଶ, there exists ܩ෨஼ଵ < ܩ஼ଶ such that for all ܩ෨஼ଵ < ܩ஼ଵ < ܩ஼ଶ 
19:597:40254:0:13:107:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:there will be exactly three equilibria, two symmetric stable segregated equilibria and one 
19:598:40345:13:26:107:265:695:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:A:unstable integrated equilibrium. 
19:599:40377:26:26:107:234:669:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Proof:  See the appendix. 
19:600:40402:26:21:71:516:643:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Proposition 3 addresses the case where differences between the public good levels are small 
19:601:40494:21:20:71:531:622:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enough that demographic preferences dominate in the determination of equilibria.  It states that 
19:602:40591:20:27:71:395:602:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in this range, the stable equilibria are characterized by segregation. 
19:603:40662:27:21:107:534:575:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We also note that while difficult to formalize because of the complexity of the boundary

19:605:40851:20:21:71:527:534:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:rizations of the model that we have evaluated, the equilibrium with the lower income minority 
19:606:40945:21:21:71:517:513:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:group in the low public good community is stable over a much broader range of public good 
19:607:41035:21:21:71:542:492:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differences than is the equilibrium with this lower income minority group in the high public good 
19:608:41133:21:26:71:135:471:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:community.  
19:609:41145:26:21:107:538:445:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Consider now the opposite extreme, where differences in public goods are very large and 
19:610:41233:21:21:71:542:424:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effectively drive the sorting behavior, swamping any effect of the demographics.  Intuitively, this 
19:611:41333:21:20:71:525:403:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:case will resemble earlier results from Epple et al. (1984) and other related papers with only a 
19:612:41430:20:21:71:534:383:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public goods component.  In particular, individuals will be stratified by income instead of segre-

19:614:41543:27:21:107:479:335:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To operationalize this intuition in our model, assume that, for given levels of

19:616:41707:21:20:72:528:293:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:functions are equal to the boundary incomes themselves, and both types view Community 2 as 
19:617:41798:20:22:71:521:273:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:more desirable regardless of demographic sorting.  By construction (Condition 2), the richest 
19:618:41892:22:21:72:525:251:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:type-b individual is richer than the boundary type-w individual when ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ = 1-2β, and the

19:622:42272:27:14:216:219:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
19:623:42320:14:16:72:533:148:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:10 This condition essentially says that the public good is a necessity.  For example, while there may be great hetero-

19:625:42547:11:12:72:526:121:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:would suffocate.  While this condition is sufficient for the emergence of a single integrated equilibrium as public 
19:626:42663:12:0:72:293:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:good differences increase, it is by no means necessary. 
20:627:42722:0:20:71:538:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and integrated, with all individuals with income above the population median income locating in 
20:628:42818:20:27:71:321:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Community 2.  Proposition 4 formalizes this result. 
20:629:42870:27:14:107:179:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f4:A:Proposition 4 
20:630:42883:14:15:107:526:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Assume that, for given levels of ܩ஼ଶܦ,௥஼ଵܦ ݀݊ܽ,௥஼ଶݕ݀݅ܤ,௥ܩ ݏܽ ܻ՜஼ଵ՜െ∞.  Then,

20:632:43048:14:14:108:216:618:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:integrated and stable. 
20:633:43071:14:25:108:234:604:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Proof:  See the appendix. 
20:634:43096:25:21:71:530:579:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:That is, when public good differences are sufficiently large, the communities will be integrated 
20:635:43193:21:21:72:515:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:by group but stratified by income.  In general, how "large" the differences in G must be will 
20:636:43287:21:27:72:325:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:depend on the preferences and income distributions. 
20:637:43339:27:20:108:518:510:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Even with perfect stratification by income, the high public good community will still 
20:638:43425:20:27:72:331:490:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:have a higher proportion of type-w residents than C1: 
20:639:43479:27:14:108:179:463:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f1:A:Proposition 5 
20:640:43492:14:14:108:517:449:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Under the conditions of Proposition 4, for sufficiently low GC1, ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଶ > ܱܴܲܲ௪஼ଵ. 
20:641:43576:14:26:108:234:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Proof:  See the appendix. 
20:642:43601:26:21:71:528:409:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The proof of Proposition 5 follows intuitively from Condition (1), first-order stochastic domin-
20:643:43697:21:20:71:530:388:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ance in the income distributions.  Essentially, since type-w are richer on average, when there is 
20:644:43795:20:21:71:533:368:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:perfect stratification by income then the richer community also has a higher share of type w.  In 
20:645:43893:21:21:71:520:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:this way, our model captures as a special case the earlier insights from McGuire (1974), who 
20:646:43986:21:20:71:533:326:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:showed how segregation can be driven by group differences in the willingness to pay for public 
20:647:44081:20:21:71:510:306:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:goods.  It also speaks to important policy issues.  For example, the "environmental justice" 
20:648:44174:21:21:71:524:285:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:movement has shown that minorities are disproportionately exposed to pollution (e.g. Bullard 
20:649:44267:21:20:71:533:264:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:2000).  Thus, our model formalizes the idea that discrimination (at least in pollution patterns) is 
20:650:44367:20:21:71:521:244:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:not necessary to drive observed correlations in the consumption of public goods such as envi-
20:651:44460:21:21:71:527:223:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ronmental quality.  Those correlations may be driven by differences in incomes and sorting on 
20:652:44554:21:27:71:226:202:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:amenities (see also Been 1994). 
20:653:44586:27:20:107:537:175:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To summarize the discussion so far, when public good levels in the two communities are 
20:654:44673:20:21:71:539:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relatively similar, all equilibria are segregated.  At intermediate differences in public good levels 
20:655:44775:21:21:71:536:134:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:it is difficult to make general statements about equilibria.  However, the stable segregated equili-
20:656:44875:21:0:71:532:113:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bria with all type-b individuals in Community 1 will exist over at least part of this range.  Final-
21:657:44978:0:20:71:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ly, when differences in public good levels are high there will be a single stable equilibrium with 
21:658:45077:20:27:71:129:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:integration. 
21:659:45090:27:21:107:523:661:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To further illustrate the implications of Propositions 3 and 4, Figure 3 displays the bid 
21:660:45180:21:20:71:525:640:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:functions for the specification of Figures 1 and 2—fixing the level of GC2 at 1 and varying the 
21:661:45276:20:21:72:539:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:level of GC1 from 0.25 to 1.  When GC1=0.25 the public goods difference is large enough that the 
21:662:45373:21:21:72:531:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:outcome resembles the limiting notion of Proposition 4 where the bid functions equal the boun-
21:663:45467:21:20:72:530:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:dary income functions.  When GC1=0.25 there is a single stable integrated equilibrium.  As GC1 
21:664:45561:20:21:71:535:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:increases to 0.5, the bid functions no longer track the boundary income functions as closely, but 
21:665:45659:21:21:71:513:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:there is still a single stable and integrated equilibrium.  When GC1=0.7, the bid functions no 
21:666:45754:21:21:72:537:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:longer cross and the only equilibrium is a stable segregated equilibria with all type-b individuals 
21:667:45854:21:20:72:527:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:located in the low public good community.  In other words, closing the gap in public goods by 
21:668:45948:20:21:71:539:475:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:improving the public good level in Community 1 causes a change from integrated equilibrium to 
21:669:46042:21:21:72:517:454:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:segregated equilibrium.  This stable segregated equilibrium exists in this example for all 1 ≥ 
21:670:46136:21:20:71:540:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:B:GC1 > 0.6.  When GC1=0.8, this stable segregated equilibrium continues to exist.  In addition, two 
21:671:46235:20:21:72:526:413:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:new equilibria appear, an unstable and a stable integrated equilibrium.  Finally, once GC1=0.9, 
21:672:46331:21:21:71:532:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:we are in the realm of Proposition 3 with two stable segregated equilibria and one unstable inte-
21:673:46428:21:20:71:518:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:grated equilibrium.  The figure illustrates the results of Propositions 3 and 4.  Namely, when 
21:674:46523:20:21:71:539:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public good differences are large, integrated equilibria (with income stratification) are especially 
21:675:46624:21:27:71:505:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:salient.  When public good differences shrink, segregated equilibria are especially salient. 
21:676:46717:27:20:107:536:303:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Figure 4 shows how the equilibria evolve as GC1 improves.  On the vertical axis it shows 
21:677:46806:20:21:72:511:283:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:levels of PCTwC1 that are sustainable as equilibria for different levels of GC1, shown on the 
21:678:46900:21:21:72:538:262:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:horizontal axis.  The figure continues to illustrate the example shown in Figure 3.  The far left of 
21:679:47001:21:21:72:512:241:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the figure, at very low levels of GC1, has a single integrated equilibrium.  As GC1 improves, 
21:680:47095:21:20:72:504:220:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:B:PCTwC1 decreases slightly as richer minorities migrate into C1.  Then a "tipping point" is 
21:681:47186:20:21:72:527:200:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reached, with type w "fleeing" C1 to the full extent possible in equilibrium, with the communi-
21:682:47281:21:21:71:527:179:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ties becoming completely segregated.  Eventually, as GC1 improves to the point that it is better 
21:683:47378:21:20:71:517:158:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:than GC2, rich whites begin to move in and the process slowly reverses, until another tipping 
21:684:47472:20:21:72:518:138:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:point is reached and "gentrification" leads to the community becoming all-w.  Finally, as the 
21:685:47566:21:0:72:514:117:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public good gap between C1 and C2 gets “large” we return to income sorting (now with the 
22:686:47658:0:26:71:237:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:richest households locating in C1. 
22:687:47693:26:27:71:149:682:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:2.4  Discussion 
22:688:47709:27:21:107:545:655:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:These results speak to at least three important policy and empirical issues in the literature.  
22:689:47805:21:20:71:513:634:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The first and most central to our application are policy concerns centered on the correlation 
22:690:47899:20:21:71:539:614:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:between low-income and/or minority populations and the levels of local public goods like public 
22:691:47995:21:21:71:526:593:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:school quality, public safety, parks and green space, and environmental quality.  The "environ-
22:692:48090:21:20:71:535:572:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:mental justice movement," for example, has highlighted such correlations with air pollution and 
22:693:48186:20:21:71:528:552:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:local toxic facilities (see e.g. Been 1994, Bullard 2000).  Our model confirms the intuition that 
22:694:48284:21:21:71:524:531:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:such sorting can be the outcome of sorting by income when there are substantial income diffe-
22:695:48377:21:21:71:534:510:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:rentials between groups.  More interestingly, racial preferences can strengthen this result, direct-
22:696:48477:21:20:71:519:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ly and indirectly.  First, with the high-G community mostly white, it will be less attractive to 
22:697:48574:20:21:71:539:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minorities.  Second, it will also be more expensive simply because of its whiteness.  Both factors 
22:698:48673:21:21:71:531:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:will tend to drive even fairly rich minorities into the minority district (a theme raised in the law 
22:699:48774:21:26:71:218:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:literature by, e.g., Ford 1994). 
22:700:48807:26:21:107:536:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:However, both advocates and analysts have raised concerns that improving public goods 
22:701:48893:21:21:71:521:380:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in low-quality neighborhoods may drive gentrification (Sieg et al. 2004, Banzhaf and McCor-

22:703:49078:20:21:71:512:339:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:unlikely that public good improvements will lead to large turnovers in racial or other group 
22:704:49171:21:21:71:537:318:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:compositions.  To the contrary, Propositions 3 and 4 together imply that improvements in public 
22:705:49267:21:20:71:532:297:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:goods may increase segregation.11  This theoretical result is generally consistent with empirical 
22:706:49365:20:21:72:514:277:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:studies of gentrifying neighborhoods that find little evidence of differential displacement of 
22:707:49460:21:21:72:535:256:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minority groups.12  Perhaps most relevant on this point is the recent empirical finding of McKin-

22:709:49658:21:36:72:528:214:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Of course, the link is not as direct as one might hope given that this literature remains mute on

22:711:49804:13:16:72:526:165:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:11 This of course depends on which of the two stable equilibria obtain.  However, a move to the stable segregated 
22:712:49918:16:11:72:533:149:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:equilibria with all type-b individuals in the high public good community would require a much larger shift in popu-

23:717:50347:26:21:107:535:682:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:A second application of our model is to the recent revival of interest in "tipping models"

23:722:50814:21:20:71:514:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:behavior in US Cities.  They identify tipping points using tract-level data, looking for break 
23:723:50909:20:21:71:531:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:points in the change in the white population as a flexible function of the baseline minority com-
23:724:51006:21:21:71:539:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:position of the tract.  They assume tipping points are identical for all tracts within a metropolitan 
23:725:51108:21:21:71:528:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:area.  However, our model suggests this is unlikely to be the case.  When two tracts have large 
23:726:51204:21:20:71:515:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differences in locational amenities, integration is supportable even with large proportions of 
23:727:51299:20:21:71:534:475:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minorities.  Conversely, when two tracts have small differences in amenities, only low levels of 
23:728:51396:21:27:71:324:454:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:integration can be supported before tipping occurs.   
23:729:51450:27:20:107:541:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Figure 5 illustrates this point.  The first panel in the figure corresponds to the last panel in 
23:730:51547:20:21:71:528:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Figure 3 (i.e., the case where G1=G2=1), but with the x-axis re-normalized to represent the pro-
23:731:51643:21:21:71:526:386:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:portion of a community's residents who are type-b rather than type-w.  In this symmetric case, 
23:732:51738:21:20:71:511:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:both communities have a tipping point where the proportion of type-b equals 0.25.  "White 
23:733:51828:20:21:71:531:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:flight" occurs where PROPb exceeds 0.25.  The second and third panels in Figure 5 correspond 
23:734:51920:21:21:72:528:324:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to the fourth panel in Figure 3 (i.e., the case where G1=0.8 and G2=1).  Panel two depicts Com-
23:735:52015:21:20:72:541:303:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:munity 1.  With these values of G, C1 experiences white flight whenever PROPb exceeds 0.21.13  
23:736:52110:20:21:71:511:283:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Comparing the first and second panels, we are essentially decreasing G from 1 to 0.8 while 
23:737:52201:21:21:71:515:262:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:holding G in the relevant substitute community constant at 1.  This is sufficient to lower the 
23:738:52296:21:27:71:347:241:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tipping point from a proportion of type-b of 0.25 to 0.21. 
23:739:52355:27:20:107:536:214:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The third panel of Figure 5 depicts Community 2 in the same "city" as the second panel.  
23:740:52444:20:21:71:540:194:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Here, tipping occurs whenever PROPb exceeds 0.29.  Comparing the first and third panels of this 
23:741:52540:21:23:72:527:173:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:figure, we hold constant the value of the public goods in Community 2 at G=1.  But in panel 1 
23:742:52634:23:13:216:219:150:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
23:743:52682:13:16:72:527:137:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:13 There is also a stable integrated equilibrium where PROPb=0.11, but as this is a stable equilibrium increases in

23:745:52912:12:0:71:169:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:0.21 in this community. 
24:746:52939:0:20:71:540:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the substitute community has G=1 while in panel 3 the substitute community has G=0.8.  This is 
24:747:53034:20:21:71:531:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sufficient to move the tipping point from a proportion of type-b of 0.25 to 0.29.  Thus, not only 
24:748:53132:21:21:71:526:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:does the level of public goods in a community determine the tipping point, but so too does the 
24:749:53227:21:26:71:374:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:level of the public goods in the relevant substitute community. 
24:750:53291:26:21:107:521:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:This sensitivity of the tipping point to public goods may be one reason more noise ap-
24:751:53377:21:21:71:518:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:pears in Card, Mas and Rothstein’s predictions about demographic changes around their esti-
24:752:53468:21:20:71:530:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:mated tipping point (see their Figure 4).  Our model suggests more precise estimates of tipping 
24:753:53564:20:21:71:542:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:points could be obtained by adjusting for differences in public goods using multiple regression or 
24:754:53663:21:27:71:145:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:other methods. 
24:755:53678:27:21:107:525:510:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Third, our results may help explain recent empirical puzzles about the demographic ef-
24:756:53764:21:20:71:534:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fects of environmental cleanup.  As noted above, the environmental justice literature shows that 
24:757:53861:20:21:71:540:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the presence of minority households is correlated with undesirable facilities like hazardous waste 
24:758:53960:21:21:71:527:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sites.  But recently, using difference-in-difference methods, Cameron and McConnaha (2006), 
24:759:54052:21:20:71:541:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Greenstone and Gallagher (2008), and Vigdor (2009) have found that improvements to such sites 
24:760:54146:20:21:71:520:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:do not appear to reduce these correlations.  They suggest this may be because of long-lasting 
24:761:54240:21:21:71:535:386:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:"stigma" of the sites or the ineffectualness of cleanup.  Our results suggest another explanation:  
24:762:54340:21:20:71:533:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the reduced form relationship may change after a cleanup, so that the correlation between pollu-
24:763:54436:20:21:71:533:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tion and race becomes even stronger, not weaker as supposed in the literature.  To illustrate this 
24:764:54535:21:23:72:538:324:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:point, consider the difference-in-difference relationships that come out of the previous example.  
24:765:54634:23:22:72:538:301:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Figure 6 plots the relationship between Gj and ܱܴܲܲ௕௝ for our two communities, with GC2=1 and

24:767:54823:21:21:72:521:258:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:shows the cross-sectional relationships for each value of GC1.  The lines illustrating the cross-
24:768:54920:21:20:72:539:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sectional relationships become successively steeper as GC1 improves, consistent with our finding 
24:769:55017:20:21:71:536:217:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that racial correlations strengthen with improving GC1, as sorting on race becomes more salient.  
24:770:55115:21:21:72:536:196:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The top panel shows difference-in-differences for each successive improvement in GC1.  Togeth-
24:771:55209:21:20:72:512:175:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:er, the two panels clearly show that while the cross-sectional differences have the expected 
24:772:55302:20:27:71:405:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:negative slope, the difference-in-differences have the opposite slope. 
24:773:55373:27:21:107:539:128:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:One way to think about this problem is in terms of a mis-specification of the standard dif-
24:774:55464:21:0:71:517:107:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ference-in-differences regression.  Our model suggests that the correlation between race and 
25:775:55560:0:20:71:541:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public goods increases as the low public good community sees increases in its public good level.

25:787:56416:21:20:72:523:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:baseline pollution levels is suggested as a control.  Although this kind of Oaxaca procedure is 
25:788:56512:20:21:72:524:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:common in the labor literature, the literature on local public goods has tended to ignore its im-
25:789:56609:21:21:72:523:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:portance.  Our model shows why it is important to take account of the changes in the reduced

25:791:56722:27:26:72:190:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:C:3.  Empirical Example 
25:792:56744:26:21:72:525:277:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:In essence, our model predicts that an exogenous improvement in public goods that closes the 
25:793:56837:21:21:72:534:256:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public goods gap across neighborhoods will change locational equilibria in such a way as to put 
25:794:56933:21:20:72:535:235:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:more emphasis on sorting by race.14  As discussed above, the model's theoretical predictions are 
25:795:57030:20:21:72:524:215:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:generally consistent with recent empirical results on gentrification and the impacts of environ-
25:796:57126:21:32:72:541:194:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:mental remediation.  However, these empirical results are rather weak evidence as to the model’s 
25:797:57223:32:14:216:219:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
25:798:57271:14:16:72:538:148:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:14 It might seem equally true that it should put less emphasis on sorting by income.  However, this is not necessarily 
25:799:57390:16:11:72:523:132:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:so.  The reason can be seen in the logic of Figure 6.  As GC1 rises and PCTwC1 falls, both effects lead to a higher 
25:800:57506:11:12:71:541:121:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:absolute value of the slope in the cross-sectional relationship between race and G.  In contrast, as GC1 rises and mean 
25:801:57626:12:0:72:517:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:income rises in C1, there are two offsetting effects on the cross-sectional relationship between income and G.   
26:802:57742:0:20:71:540:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:empirical relevance.  Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no extant work that bears directly 
26:803:57841:20:21:71:527:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:on this question.  As an initial attempt to fill this gap, we consider the demographic shifts asso-
26:804:57940:21:21:71:532:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ciated with large reductions in localized toxic air emissions that occurred in California between 
26:805:58038:21:26:71:482:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:1990 and 2000, using a data set previously assembled by Banzhaf and Walsh (2008). 
26:806:58120:26:21:107:536:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:At the core of the data are 25,166 "communities" defined by a set of tangent half-mile di-

26:808:58307:21:20:71:523:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the virtue of establishing equally sized communities with randomly drawn boundaries, in con-

26:810:58489:21:21:71:538:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:matched to the presence of large industrial emitters of air pollution and their emissions levels, as 
26:811:58590:21:21:71:542:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:recorded in the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), in each year from 1990 to 2000.  TRI releases are

26:816:59061:20:21:72:526:413:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:usual case, this is likely to have a "conservative" effect on our results, biasing them to zero, as

26:831:60313:16:0:72:414:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:over time, we have limited the data to the common set of chemicals used since 1988.

27:833:60490:20:21:71:524:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:exposed in 1988-1990) losing their exposure by 1998-2000.  Figure 7 shows the link between 
27:834:60581:21:21:71:542:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:baseline TRI exposure and the 10-year change in emissions.  The figure clearly demonstrates that 
27:835:60678:21:20:71:541:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the largest pollution reductions occurred in the communities with the highest baseline emissions.  
27:836:60777:20:21:71:514:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Thus, these improvements are consistent with the "large" improvements in low-public good 
27:837:60866:21:27:71:220:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:communities discussed above.

27:849:61740:21:21:72:531:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:spatial amenities is to employ in Lj successively more stringent time-invariant spatial variables, 
27:850:61839:21:21:71:539:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:including controls for latitude and distance from the coast, school district dummies, and zip code 
27:851:61938:21:20:71:538:273:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:dummies.  These effects should capture unobserved public goods that vary on a spatial scale that 
27:852:62035:20:21:71:528:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:exceeds that of the pollution impacts from TRI facilities.  School district fixed effects have the 
27:853:62134:21:21:71:533:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:advantage of mapping directly into an important but difficult-to-measure local public good, and 
27:854:62230:21:20:72:521:211:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:zip code fixed effects control for locational amenities that vary on spatial scale much smaller 
27:855:62326:20:27:71:217:191:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:than that of a school district.

28:879:62581:42:20:72:533:625:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The table clearly shows that as the public goods gap shrinks from 1990 to 2000, sorting on race 
28:880:62677:20:21:72:533:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:increased—precisely the predictions in the model.  As the time-invariant locational controls get 
28:881:62774:21:21:72:535:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:more local, the estimated levels of the cross-sectional sorting parameter shrink, perhaps because 
28:882:62872:21:20:72:541:563:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of unobservables or perhaps simply because less variation remains for estimating the model.  But 
28:883:62969:20:21:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in all cases, the estimated change in the relationship is consistently around 3 percentage points 
28:884:63067:21:21:72:538:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and highly significant.  That is, the effect of a "typical" polluting plant was associated with more 
28:885:63168:21:21:72:532:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minorities in both years, but in 2000 the typical plant was associated with an increase in nearby 
28:886:63266:21:26:72:435:480:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minorities 3 percentage points more than was the same sized plant in 1990. 
28:887:63341:26:21:108:539:454:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Moreover, these results are robust to a number of alternative specifications of the model.  
28:888:63433:21:21:72:526:433:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:In particular, we estimated the model on only the extensive margin of proximity to a polluting 
28:889:63528:21:20:72:525:412:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:facility as well as only the intensive margin of logged emissions.  The results are qualitatively 
28:890:63626:20:21:72:516:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:similar for these variants of the model.  We also estimated the model separately on the eight 
28:891:63720:21:21:72:518:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:metropolitan statistical areas in California with populations above 1 million.  Again, the city-
28:892:63816:21:20:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:specific results are qualitatively similar to the pooled results, though naturally somewhat less 
28:893:63913:20:21:72:540:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:precise.18  Finally, the effects are qualitatively similar if we consider the effect of an average size 
28:894:64017:21:27:72:223:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:plant in 2000 rather than 1990. 
28:895:64049:27:27:72:152:282:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:C:4.  Conclusions 
28:896:64065:27:20:72:516:255:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Our model suggests that any analysis of the distribution of spatially delineated public goods 
28:897:64159:20:21:71:533:235:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:across demographic groups must account for endogenous sorting on those demographics, while 
28:898:64250:21:23:71:539:214:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:at the same time studies of spatial patterns in demographics must account for public goods.  That

28:900:64396:14:17:72:481:177:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:17 Similar results are obtained by using the average of 2000 emissions as an alternative normalization. 
28:901:64500:17:16:72:535:160:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:18 In particular, for all three specifications of the spatial controls, the effect of the normalized level of pollution was 
28:902:64624:16:12:72:534:144:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:greater in 2000 than in 1990 for six of the eight metropolitan statistical areas, with the difference being statistically 
28:903:64746:12:11:71:524:132:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:significant in four or five of these cities, depending on the model.  The estimated effect of pollution was actually 
28:904:64863:11:12:71:526:121:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:smaller in 2000 than in 1990 for two of the eight cities, but the difference is not statistically significant.  Detailed 
28:905:64984:12:0:71:224:109:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:F:results are available from the authors. 
29:906:65027:0:20:71:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:is, sorting models in the tradition of Tiebout (1956) and tipping models in the tradition of Schel-
29:907:65126:20:21:71:527:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ling (1969) are fundamentally connected.  We show that when sorting includes demographics, 
29:908:65217:21:21:71:519:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:changes in public goods can lead to counter-intuitive results.  In particular, improving public 
29:909:65313:21:26:71:444:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:good levels in disadvantaged communities can actually increase segregation. 
29:910:65389:26:21:107:533:620:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Schelling's (1969, 1971) original insight into these issues was that complete segregation 
29:911:65479:21:21:71:517:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:can result even with ubiquitous tastes for some positive level of integration, a result recently 
29:912:65576:21:20:71:535:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:extended by Pancs and Vriend (2007).  Consequently, modest changes in preferences are unlike-
29:913:65669:20:21:71:528:558:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ly to reduce segregation.  More recently, Bayer et al. (2005) and Sethi and Somanathan (2004) 
29:914:65763:21:21:71:525:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:find that increasing the number of high socio-economic status minorities in a city actually can 
29:915:65859:21:21:71:529:516:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:increase segregation.  They find that such people-based policies have this effect because richer 
29:916:65956:21:26:71:456:495:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:minorities now have enough mass to form their own high-income communities. 
29:917:66031:26:21:107:530:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Our results suggest that place-based policies pose the same dilemma, but for a different 
29:918:66120:21:21:71:522:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reason:  group-based sorting becomes more salient when there is less reason to sort on the ex-
29:919:66214:21:20:71:529:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:ogenous public good.  Taken in the context of the existing literature, our results contribute to a 
29:920:66313:20:21:71:525:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:theme that now appears to be growing by accretion.  Apparently, neither changes in tastes nor 
29:921:66407:21:21:71:536:386:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:changes in income distributions nor changes in the spatial distribution of public goods are likely 
29:922:66506:21:20:71:520:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to reduce the level of segregation in a society.  Little wonder, then, that segregation has been

41:1208:78009:26:26:71:363:635:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We begin by noting that when public good levels are equal:

41:1212:78186:28:20:72:541:550:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(a) is true because Drj is highest in the community with more of type j.  With GC1=GC2, it follows 
41:1213:78285:20:21:72:540:530:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that Vrj is also higher in that community.  (b) follows by the symmetric logic.  (c) also follows by 
41:1214:78386:21:21:72:511:509:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:similar logic:  in this case, DrC1=DrC2 so VC1=VC2.  Observation 4 shows that (a) and (b) are 
41:1215:78480:21:20:72:517:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:associated with segregated equilibria.  As already noted, all segregated equilibria are stable.  
41:1216:78577:20:21:72:532:468:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Observation 5 shows that (c) is associated with an integrated equilibrium.  However, this equili-
41:1217:78674:21:21:72:517:447:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:brium is unstable because as soon as a single type-w individual in C1 switches with a type-b 
41:1218:78766:21:21:72:532:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:individual in C2, then PCTwC1 < 1-β and we are in case (a).  Likewise, if a type-w individual in 
41:1219:78863:21:26:72:374:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f1:B:C2 switches with a type-b individual in C1, we are in case (b).

41:1221:78950:27:21:72:538:352:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The proposition follows directly from Proposition 2 together with the continuity of the boundary

41:1227:79415:27:27:72:265:216:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We prove this proposition in four steps.

42:1277:80176:32:22:72:528:307:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Again, since Bidy → y, it follows that ݀݅ܤ௒ത್=ܻ௕ெ௔௫ and ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ=ܨ௪ିଵሺ1െ2ߚሻ.  Using Equation

42:1285:80539:27:23:72:529:146:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We now combine parts (i) to (iii).  By part (ii), we have that at PCTwC1=1-2β, ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ > ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ.  
42:1286:80636:23:22:71:535:123:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:By part (i), we know ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ is monotonically decreasing in PCTwC1 and ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ is monotonically 
42:1287:80730:22:0:72:524:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:increasing.  By part (iii) we have that at PCTwC1=1, ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ < ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ.  Therefore, the two boun-
43:1288:80828:0:22:71:528:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:dary income bid functions cross once, with ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ crossing ݀݅ܤ௒ത್ from above.  This is a stable 
43:1289:80924:22:21:72:515:686:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:integrated equilibrium.  Moreover, as noted above the segregated equilibria are ruled out by 
43:1290:81017:21:27:72:152:665:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Observation 4.   
43:1291:81034:27:27:72:407:638:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Therefore, a single equilibrium exists, it is integrated, and it is stable. 
43:1292:81110:27:26:72:191:611:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:C:Proof of Proposition 5. 
43:1293:81134:26:23:72:541:585:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:By Observation (5), in an integrated equilibrium ݀݅ܤ௒തೢ = ݀݅ܤ௒ത್.  Since BidYr → Y as GC1→-∞, it 
43:1294:81229:23:27:71:467:562:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:follows that ܻത௪ܻൌത௕=ܻ ത.  By first order stochastic dominance, F(ܻത௕ሻ/F(ܻത௪ሻ ≥ 1.
