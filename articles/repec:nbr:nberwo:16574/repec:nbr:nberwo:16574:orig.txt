2:32:1631:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper estimates the effect of corporate governance provisions on shareholder value and long-term
2:33:1732:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:outcomes in S&P1500 firms. We apply a regression discontinuity design to shareholder votes on governance
2:34:1836:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:proposals in annual meetings. A close-call vote around the majority threshold is akin to a random outcome,
2:35:1942:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:allowing us to deal with prior expectations and the endogeneity of internal governance rules. Passing
2:36:2043:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:a corporate governance provision generates a 1.3% abnormal return on the day of the vote with an
2:37:2139:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:implied market value per provision of 2.8%. We also find evidence of changes in investment behavior
2:38:2238:14:42:72:278:504:12:Times:12:Times:and long-term performance improvements.

3:58:2673:0:33:54:190:739:301:g_d0_f1:301:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:59:2688:33:22:54:558:706:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The agency problem — the conflict created by the misalignment of incentives between owners and
3:60:2782:22:22:54:558:684:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:managers — is at the heart of our understanding of howfirms work (Berle and Means, 1932; Jensen
3:61:2877:22:21:54:557:662:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Meckling, 1976); and the corporate governance structure of thefirm should be designed to
3:62:2969:21:22:54:557:641:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:minimize the costs created by that conflict.  Yet, a critical element of corporate governance in
3:63:3065:22:22:53:557:619:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:modern corporations are provisions that protect managers from the external discipline of takeovers
3:64:3163:22:21:53:557:597:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(such as poison pills, staggered boards or golden parachutes) and statutes that insulate them from
3:65:3261:21:22:54:558:576:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the monitoring and control of shareholders (Gompers, Ishii and Metrick, 2003; Bebchuck, Cohen
3:66:3354:22:22:54:558:554:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Ferrell, 2004). It may be appropriate to protect managers in this way if excessive shareholder
3:67:3452:22:21:54:558:532:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:oversight is disruptive or encourages them to focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term
3:68:3551:21:22:54:558:511:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:performance (Comment and Schwert, 1995; Stein, 1988). Some have argued, however, that boards
3:69:3643:22:22:54:557:489:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of directors are not sufficiently independent from management and that shareholder activism may
3:70:3738:22:21:54:557:467:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:have limited ability to bring about effective control.  As a result, current corporate governance
3:71:3835:21:22:54:558:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:arrangements may not result from an optimal decision by shareholders; but rather they may reflect
3:72:3932:22:22:54:558:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:imperfections in thefirm’s political process and the excessive power of constituencies with other
3:73:4029:22:21:54:554:402:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:goals (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001 and 2003;Perez-Gonzalez, 2006; Bennedsen et al., 2007).
3:74:4123:21:22:71:558:381:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Establishing empirically how increasing shareholder rights affects shareholder value, and what
3:75:4217:22:22:53:558:359:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:type of shareholder rights have bigger effects, is essential for our understanding of the internal
3:76:4315:22:21:53:557:337:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance offirms.  It also has clear implications for the debate on shareholder oversight and
3:77:4410:21:22:53:557:316:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:regulatory reform of corporate governance. Prior research has shown that legislative changes that
3:78:4507:22:22:53:558:294:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:affect external governance measures, such as state-levelanti-takeover legislation, increase managerial
3:79:4609:22:21:53:557:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:slack and reduce performance (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Garvey and Hanka, 1999; Giroud
3:80:4702:21:22:53:557:251:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Mueller, forthcoming).  Internal governance arrangements, the ones developed by thefirm
3:81:4793:22:22:53:557:229:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:itself, have been the subject of much research, but the evidence provided in these papers is mixed
3:82:4891:22:22:53:557:207:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and, most importantly, based on correlations rather than causal estimates.1This paper provides
3:83:4985:22:21:53:557:185:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a causal estimate of the effect of changes in thefirm’s internal corporate governance structure —
3:84:5082:21:22:54:558:164:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:resulting from shareholder governance proposals at annual meetings —, on shareholder value and
3:85:5176:22:21:54:156:142:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:managers’ behavior.
3:86:5195:21:18:71:557:121:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In practice, it is generally difficult tofindasettingwhereafirm’s governance structure changes
3:87:5289:18:16:67:558:103:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1See the surveys by Shleifer and Vishny (1997), and Becht, Bolton and Röell (2005). In their influential paper,
3:88:5400:16:12:54:558:87:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003) found that, in the 1990s, a trading strategy that boughtfirms with better gover-
3:89:5514:12:12:54:558:75:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:nance and sold those with worse governance achieved an 8.5% annual excess return. However, others have questioned
3:90:5627:12:12:54:557:63:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:whether there could be any systematic long-run excess returns since these should be incorporated immediately in
3:91:5738:12:0:54:255:51:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:stock prices (Core, Guay and Rusticus, 2006).
4:92:5784:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:exogenously such that we can estimate a causal effect. We argue that a regression discontinuity
4:93:5879:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:design on the outcomes of shareholder proposals in annual meetings provides us with this ideal
4:94:5973:21:22:54:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:quasi-experimental setting (Cellini, Ferreira and Rothstein, 2010). It also allows us to overcome two
4:95:6074:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:important limitations of any analysis based on a regression of stock-market returns on the presence of
4:96:6176:22:21:54:558:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance provisions. First, the choice of governance structure and the type of provisions adopted
4:97:6275:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:byfirms is arguably endogenous and correlated with otherfirm characteristics; thus, comparing
4:98:6368:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the returns offirms with different governance structures is likely to capture the effect of those
4:99:6465:22:21:54:557:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unobserved characteristics, rather than the effect of governance. Second, if investors know about
4:100:6562:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the superior performance of better-governedfirms, their knowledge should be incorporated into
4:101:6655:22:22:54:558:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:prices, and we should not observe any systematic differences in abnormal returns (as emphasized
4:102:6750:22:21:54:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by Core, et al., 2006). To overcome these limitations, we need a setting in which governance rules
4:103:6848:21:22:54:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are exogenously or "randomly" adopted and, at the same time, one in which their adoption is not
4:104:6943:22:22:54:329:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:foreseen by the market and incorporated into returns.
4:105:6996:22:21:71:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In their annual meetings, shareholders propose and vote on a large number of governance-
4:106:7084:21:22:54:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:related provisions.2Our approach is to use a regression discontinuity design that compares the
4:107:7178:22:22:53:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reaction of the stock market to shareholder-sponsored governance proposals that pass by a small
4:108:7273:22:21:53:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:margin to the reaction to those that fail by a small margin. We show that, even though these
4:109:7365:21:22:53:557:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals are not binding, passing a proposal by a small margin discretely increases its probability
4:110:7465:22:22:53:557:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of implementation. For these close-call proposals, passing is akin to an independent random event
4:111:7562:22:21:53:558:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(it is "locally" exogenous) and, therefore, uncorrelated withfirm characteristics. This approach is
4:112:7661:21:22:53:558:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:immune, by construction, to any observed or unobserved confounding factors as long as their effect
4:113:7759:22:22:53:557:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is continuous around the threshold. We show that indeed, for votes around the majority threshold,
4:114:7856:22:21:53:558:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing is uncorrelated with observedfirm and meeting characteristics, such that by focusing on
4:115:7951:21:22:53:558:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:these proposals we can estimate a causal effect.  In addition, it is precisely for these close-call
4:116:8050:22:22:53:557:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals that the vote contains substantial information —switching from an unpredictable outcome
4:117:8147:22:21:53:557:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to either pass or fail— that is not already fully incorporated in prices. We present an analytical
4:118:8245:21:22:53:557:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:framework that shows how stock prices should react for each observed vote outcome; this allows us
4:119:8342:22:22:53:557:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to recover the value of passing a provision from the outcome of votes around the majority threshold.
4:120:8442:22:21:53:557:132:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We also discuss how the observed reaction varies with the probability of implementing a proposal and
4:121:8542:21:22:53:557:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:other information that may be contained in the vote outcome. This is, in a nutshell, the regression
4:122:8641:22:18:53:558:89:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discontinuity design that provides us with causal estimates of the effect of shareholder-sponsored
4:123:8739:18:15:67:557:71:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2These include provisions that lower takeover barriers, regulate the independence of the board from management,
4:124:8850:15:0:54:459:56:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:define the voting rules in annual meetings, and decide on executive and board compensation.

5:126:8952:22:21:71:557:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Our dataset includes all shareholder-sponsored governance proposals voted on in U.S.firms in

5:130:9328:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by selective withdrawal around the discontinuity (see Listokin, 2008 and section 4).3Given the
5:131:9422:22:22:53:557:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:structure of our data, we adopt the empirical dynamic regression discontinuity model proposed
5:132:9515:22:21:53:557:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by Cellini, Ferreira and Rothstein (2010), and we allow the result of the vote in any given annual
5:133:9613:21:22:53:557:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:meeting to affect future outcomes and the votes in future meetings. We also adapt this methodology
5:134:9711:22:22:53:273:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to deal with multiple votes in one meeting.
5:135:9754:22:21:71:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The results show that, on the day of the vote, a shareholder governance proposal that passes
5:136:9846:21:22:53:557:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:yields an abnormal return of 1.3% relative to one that fails; there are no significant additional
5:137:9943:22:22:53:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:returns on subsequent days. This price reaction is more pronounced for the set of anti-takeover
5:138:10038:22:21:53:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provisions included in the G-index developed by Gompers et al.  (2003), suggesting that these
5:139:10131:21:22:53:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are important for governance (since Jensen, 1986, it has been argued that takeover threats are an
5:140:10228:22:22:53:558:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:important form of managerial discipline).4In particular, the effect is largely driven by proposals
5:141:10326:22:21:54:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to eliminate classified boards and poison pills, which represent 68% of G-Index proposals that fall
5:142:10425:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:around the majority threshold. We alsofind that other proposals, such as those increasing board
5:143:10520:22:22:54:558:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:independence, have a positive, but weaker, effect on returns. Finally, wefind that the effect is
5:144:10616:22:21:54:558:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:stronger amongfirms with concentrated ownership, for those with a large number of anti-takeover
5:145:10711:21:22:54:378:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provisions in place, and for those with high R&D expenditures.
5:146:10773:22:22:71:557:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Since the outcome of these votes is not binding, the price reaction is likely to underestimate the
5:147:10871:22:21:54:558:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:full value of implementing these proposals. In addition, passing a proposal may affect the probability
5:148:10973:21:22:54:558:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that other provisions are submitted and passed in the future. To estimate the value of implementing
5:149:11072:22:22:54:558:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a proposal, we need to take this information into account. We estimate that passing a proposal
5:150:11166:22:21:54:558:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:around the discontinuity leads to a discrete 31% increase in the probability of implementation (we
5:151:11264:21:22:54:558:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:measure implementation as the change in the number of anti-takeover provisions thefirm has in
5:152:11357:22:22:54:558:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:place) and to an increase in the probability of proposing and passing proposals in future meetings.
5:153:11456:22:17:54:558:132:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Using these probabilities, we calculate that, for the S&P 1500firms in our sample, adopting a
5:154:11549:17:16:67:557:115:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:3This yields almost 4,000 proposals. We restrict ourselves to these shareholder-sponsored proposals given that
5:155:11659:16:12:54:557:99:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(unlike management-sponsored ones) shareholder proposals cannot be removed by the management of thefirm, and
5:156:11767:12:12:54:558:87:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:their vote distribution is not affected by strategic withdrawal around the discontinuity (see Listokin, 2008 and section
5:157:11887:12:8:54:66:75:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f2:4).
5:158:11890:8:0:67:404:67:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:4The G-index is the number of anti-takeover provisions thefirm has in place.
6:159:11967:0:22:54:505:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance proposal increases shareholder value by 2.8%. This is a non-negligible effect.
6:160:12056:22:21:71:557:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The estimated stock-price reaction may reflect the expectation of changes in performance from
6:161:12149:21:22:54:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance improvements, as well as the implied reduction in agency costs, but it may also reflect
6:162:12247:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a pure takeover premium (if a takeover is more likely under the new governance arrangement). To
6:163:12342:22:21:54:557:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:explore these two possible explanations, we examine the real effects beyond the stock-price reaction
6:164:12442:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on the day of the vote. The regression discontinuity design allows us to study the effect of the new
6:165:12542:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance arrangements on variables such as acquisitions and capital expenditures, which have
6:166:12636:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:been used as proxies for empire building and potentially inefficient behavior (e.g., Gompers et al.,
6:167:12736:21:22:53:557:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:2003; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2003). Wefind that acquisitions and capital expenditures fall
6:168:12829:22:22:53:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as a result of passing corporate governance proposals. We alsofind evidence thatfirm value —as
6:169:12923:22:21:53:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reflected by Tobin’s Q, book-to-market value of thefirm— increases in the years following the vote.
6:170:13022:21:22:53:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We interpret these results as evidence thatfirms are operated differently as a result of their improved
6:171:13125:22:22:53:558:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:corporate governance structure, reflecting changes in managers’ behavior. Finally, the effect that
6:172:13223:22:21:53:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:we identify is, by definition, only forfirms that have observations around the discontinuity, and this
6:173:13325:21:22:53:558:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:determines how much one can extrapolate the results of our analysis to otherfirms. However, we
6:174:13419:22:22:53:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:show thatfirms that have observations falling around the threshold are not very different from other
6:175:13519:22:21:54:557:392:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firms that are targets, and that 35% of the G-index proposals fall within ten percentage points of
6:176:13617:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the majority threshold. This suggests that our results can be directly generalizable to a sizeable set

6:178:13746:22:21:71:557:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The next section describes the data and presents an analytical framework of how the informa-
6:179:13838:21:22:54:557:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tion on the stock-price reaction to the outcome ofgovernance votes that fall around the majority
6:180:13934:22:22:54:557:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:threshold allows us to recover the effect of governance proposals. Section III presents the empirical
6:181:14035:22:21:54:558:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model used to identify this effect. Section IV provides evidence on the regression discontinuity in
6:182:14134:21:51:54:557:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shareholder votes as a quasi-experiment. SectionV presents the results, and Section VI concludes.

6:186:14393:22:18:54:558:100:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals from 1997 until 2007.5Our sample includes all 3,984 shareholder proposals Riskmetrics

7:195:15310:21:22:53:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as a recommendation to the board of directors —that is, the outcome of the vote is non-binding.
7:196:15405:22:22:53:557:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Ertimur, Ferri and Stubben (forthcoming) show that 31.1% of the shareholder proposals that pass
7:197:15500:22:21:53:433:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are implemented, while only 3.2% of those not approved are implemented.
7:198:15571:21:22:71:557:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Riskmetrics classifies the proposals into 72 distinct types. While the effect of the different types
7:199:15671:22:22:53:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of proposals is probably heterogeneous, we bundle them into broader categories due to the lim-
7:200:15765:22:21:53:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ited number of observations in each group. For descriptive purposes, we group these governance
7:201:15859:21:22:53:557:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals into six categories widely used in the literature: anti-takeover proposals (G-index), com-
7:202:15959:22:22:53:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:pensation, voting, auditors, board structure and other (see Appendix A). Panel A of Table 1 displays
7:203:16059:22:21:53:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the frequency of governance proposals, the percent approved and the average support over time.
7:204:16153:21:22:53:558:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:From 2003 onwards, there is a significant increase in the number of proposals, over 400 cases per
7:205:16250:22:22:53:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:year, and around 30% of those are approved. Panel B also shows that G-index proposals obtained
7:206:16344:22:21:53:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the highest levels of shareholder support and were approved in 53% of the cases. Compensation
7:207:16437:21:22:53:557:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals were approved only in 4.2% of the cases, board structure in 8.8% and voting proposals
7:208:16532:22:22:53:558:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in 3.3%. For the empirical analysis, the difference in approval rates means that we have very few
7:209:16629:22:21:54:558:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:observations on compensation, board structure or voting around the discontinuity, so we will have to
7:210:16729:21:22:54:558:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:further pool all those proposals and analyze them together. Appendix A shows the number of pro-
7:211:16824:22:22:54:558:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:posals of each type falling around the majority threshold. Among the 523 G-Index proposals within
7:212:16921:22:21:54:557:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:5 percentage points of the discontinuity, 219 (42 percent) are proposals to repeal classified boards,
7:213:17022:21:22:53:557:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and 132 (25 percent) are proposals to eliminate poison pills. Among the 387 Other (non-Gindex)
7:214:17116:22:22:53:557:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:kinds of proposals around the discontinuity, 115 (or 30 percent) are proposals to elect directors
7:215:17213:22:21:53:557:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:through a majority vote, and 68 (18 percent) are proposals to expense stock options. Throughout
7:216:17308:21:22:53:527:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the paper, we analyze two sets of proposals (G-index vs. Other) both pooled and separately.
7:217:17399:22:21:71:557:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:For the 948firmsthatconstituteourfinal sample, we obtained additional information from a
7:218:17487:21:9:54:338:133:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:year, and continue to own them through the date of the meeting.
7:219:17550:9:15:67:557:124:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:6We checked that all the proposals go in the direction of increasing shareholder rights and control, or improving
7:220:17663:15:12:54:557:109:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:alignment. We also used a second Riskmetrics dataset with information on whether majority is computed out of
7:221:17771:12:12:54:557:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:votes cast or outstanding, and on the majority threshold. Most proposals have a 50% majority threshold, three had
7:222:17884:12:12:54:558:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:a 66.7% threshold, three had a 70% threshold and four had an 80% threshold. We also used this dataset to check
7:223:17994:12:12:54:557:73:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that the vote was correctly recorded. In the cases where wefound discrepancies between the two datasets, we looked

8:229:18472:56:22:54:558:596:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In this section, we present an analytical framework that shows how to recover the value of a
8:230:18564:22:21:54:558:574:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:governance provision by focusing on close votes in shareholder-sponsored governance proposals.

8:237:19205:21:22:54:558:423:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:empirical analysis is to estimateW, the value of implementing a governance proposal, which is not
8:238:19302:22:22:53:557:401:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:directly observable. As the day of the vote approaches, investors use all the available information
8:239:19401:22:22:53:557:379:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to form an expectation of the probability that the proposal will succeed, and this expectation is
8:240:19498:22:21:53:557:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:incorporated in stock prices. Therefore, the price reaction —the abnormal return— that we observe

8:245:19950:22:22:53:558:249:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for votes that have a vote sharevclose to zero, the market had already assigned a low probability
8:246:20047:22:21:53:558:227:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that they would pass, and, therefore,E(W|v)is close to zero. Similarly, for votes around 100%,
8:247:20141:21:22:53:558:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the market assigned a high probability of passing andE(W|v)is close toW. In contrast, around
8:248:20233:22:22:54:558:184:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the threshold, the market had assigned a roughly 50% probability that the vote would pass and
8:249:20326:22:21:54:173:162:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:E(W|v)is close to12W.
8:250:20347:21:22:71:558:141:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:SinceE(W|v)is a continuous function ofv,butW(v)is discontinuous at the majority threshold,
8:251:20437:22:15:53:557:119:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the abnormal return that one observes when the outcome of the vote is known is also discontinuous
8:252:20534:15:16:67:558:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:7Most of these datasets are recorded at the end of thefiscal year. To determine what is thefirst observation after
8:253:20648:16:12:53:557:88:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:a vote, we require that the end of thefiscal year is at least six months after the meeting where the vote is recorded.
8:254:20766:12:8:53:503:76:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:If it is less than six months, then we use the following year available as thefirst year after the meeting.
8:255:20873:8:0:67:409:68:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f10:8See supplemental Appendix for details on how to deriveE(W|v)analytically.
9:256:20948:0:22:54:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f5:at the majority threshold. In fact, the difference in abnormal returns at the majority threshold —Z
9:257:21047:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in Figure 1— between a vote that barely fails and one that barely passes is exactly the value of the
9:258:21147:21:22:54:559:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f5:proposal. Under the set of assumptions outlined earlier:Z=(W−E(W|v))−(0−E(W|v)) =W.
9:259:21230:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Therefore, one can recover the value of the proposal from the difference in abnormal returns of
9:260:21325:22:21:54:334:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:close-call votes or, in other words, at the discontinuity.
9:261:21383:21:22:71:558:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The earlier example made a number of assumptions that may not necessarily hold in reality.
9:262:21473:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In practice, shareholder proposals are typically not binding.  A proposal may pass but not be
9:263:21566:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implemented; thusW(v)will be below the effective value of the proposal to the right of the threshold,
9:264:21667:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and the market reaction to proposals that pass by a close margin will be less positive than if the vote
9:265:21770:22:22:54:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:were binding. Similarly, if management feels that a proposal that fails to pass by a few votes should
9:266:21871:22:21:54:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:still be implemented,W(v)will be slightly positive to the left of the threshold and the market
9:267:21965:21:22:54:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reaction will be less negative. Furthermore,W(v)may incorporate the probability that the current
9:268:22061:22:22:54:558:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:vote will trigger another proposal in the future that, in turn, may or may not pass. As a result,
9:269:22158:22:21:54:557:457:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:E(W|v)and abnormal returns are not necessarily symmetric around the threshold, as in our simple
9:270:22253:21:22:54:558:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:example in Figure 1. Still, providedE(W|v)is continuous and the probability of implementation
9:271:22346:22:22:54:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discontinuous around the threshold, thenZcan be used to measure the value of the proposal to the
9:272:22442:22:21:54:558:392:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firm. In this case, the value estimated at the discontinuity,Z,isnotequaltoW, as in the previous
9:273:22538:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:example (Supplemental Appendix Figure SA5 illustrates this case). In order to recover the value of
9:274:22636:22:22:54:558:349:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:Wfrom our estimateZ, we need to consider that, around the discontinuity, the market is updating
9:275:22731:22:21:54:558:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:both the probability of implementation and the chances of proposing and passing future proposals.
9:276:22828:21:22:71:557:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Note that our identification strategy does not require proposals to be binding. As discussed in
9:277:22923:22:22:54:558:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Lee and Lemieux (forthcoming), the identification strategy is still valid as long as there is a discrete
9:278:23027:22:21:54:558:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:jump in the probability of implementation at the majority threshold (this is the "fuzzy" regression

9:285:23627:21:19:53:557:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of two elements: the value associated with the current proposal being implemented, (pIWf), plus
9:286:23722:19:16:67:557:92:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:9In Ertimur, Ferri and Stubben (forthcoming), the change in the probability of implementation at the major-
9:287:23829:16:12:54:557:76:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:ity threshold can be inferred to be around of 20.7%; and insection 5.1.3, we estimate a discrete change in the
9:288:23939:12:0:53:516:64:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:implementation probability of 30.1% within two years for the subset of proposals that affect the G-index .

10:302:24304:37:22:71:557:615:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:One important question that arises when trying to infer the value of a proposal from the abnormal
10:303:24401:22:21:54:557:593:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:returns at the discontinuity is whether we should expect any effect at all of votes that barely pass
10:304:24501:21:22:54:558:572:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:or fail. Shareholder votes should reflect a value-maximizing decision. If all shareholders were trying
10:305:24603:22:22:54:558:550:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to maximize shareholder value, and in the absence of transaction costs, then they should all vote
10:306:24700:22:21:54:558:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the same way, in favor of or against a proposal. If shareholders are identical but have different
10:307:24800:21:22:54:558:507:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:information on the value of a proposal, then some votes would fall around the discontinuity, and
10:308:24896:22:22:54:558:485:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:those would correspond to proposals whose value to thefirm is neutral or uncertain. However, when
10:309:24993:22:21:54:558:463:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the objective of some shareholders is not to maximize shareholder’s value (say, in the presence
10:310:25088:21:22:54:557:442:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of other private benefits), then the outcome of the vote will depend on the distribution of their
10:311:25185:22:22:54:557:420:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:preferences.In this sense, it is well-documented that different types of shareholders vote differently
10:312:25287:22:21:54:557:398:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:because they are heterogeneous in their objectives, and may have other stakes in thefirm. For
10:313:25380:21:22:54:558:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:example, it has been shown that banks and insurance companies tend to side with management
10:314:25470:22:22:54:558:355:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by voting against the proposals, while mutual funds, unions, advisors and pension funds tend to
10:315:25565:22:21:54:557:333:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:support the proposals (Brickley, Lease and Smith, 1988; Agrawal, 2008). The fact that wefind
10:316:25657:21:22:54:558:312:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:positive abnormal returns at the discontinuity suggests that there are decisions that maximize
10:317:25751:22:44:54:480:290:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shareholder value but are hard to implement given the ownership patterns offirms.

10:322:26092:21:22:54:558:147:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:factors and the momentum factor from Carhart (1997).10It is the empirical counterpart of Figure
10:323:26187:22:18:54:558:125:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:1, although note that since, in practice, vote outcomes are not binding and may trigger future
10:324:26281:18:15:63:557:107:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:10These three factors are standard in the literature and adjust for different sources of risk that should affect daily
10:325:26399:15:12:53:557:92:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:returns, including the market factor (excess market return), a size factor, and a factor that accounts for the security

10:327:26630:12:12:53:557:68:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:date; the length of the estimation period is 200 trading days, and we impose at least 15 days with returns to make
10:328:26744:12:0:53:133:56:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:it into the sample.
11:329:26764:0:22:54:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals, this can make the effects non-symmetric around zero. The graph plots the average daily

11:332:27050:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the vote, proposals that pass by a small margin have positive abnormal returns, and comparing

11:334:27246:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:returns. Notice that proposals that pass by more than a 5% margin display zero abnormal returns,
11:335:27342:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:which is consistent with the fact that the market can forecast with some accuracy the probability
11:336:27439:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of passing a proposal, and this is incorporated in prices. Mostfirms disclose vote outcomes on the

11:346:28279:33:22:54:557:330:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This section describes how we can estimate the causal effect of shareholder governance proposals
11:347:28375:22:44:54:509:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on shareholder returns and other outcomes using a regression discontinuity (RD) setting.
11:348:28463:44:29:54:410:264:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:3.1  Regression discontinuity in shareholder votes
11:349:28513:29:22:54:557:235:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Suppose that shareholders offirmfvote on a shareholder proposal at timet,the meeting date,
11:350:28603:22:21:54:557:213:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and that this proposal gets a total vote share (percentage of votes in favor)vft.Ifvftis larger
11:351:28698:21:22:53:557:192:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:than the majority thresholdv∗, then this proposal passes and we code the indicator for pass as
11:352:28792:22:22:53:150:170:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f5:Dft=1(vft>v∗).
11:353:28806:22:21:71:557:148:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f5:We are interested in the effect that passing a certain proposal has on an outcome variableyft.
11:354:28900:21:44:53:155:127:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Then, we can write:
11:355:28919:44:31:251:558:83:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:yft=κ+Dftθ+uft,(2)
11:356:28937:31:0:54:558:52:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:where the coefficientθwe are interested in is the effect of passing a proposal in a shareholder
12:357:29034:0:22:54:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:meeting on the outcome variableyft—say, abnormal returns, or the probability of future proposals
12:358:29130:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing— anduftrepresents all other determinants of the outcome (E(uft)=0). The problem with
12:359:29222:21:22:54:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimating a regression such as (2) directly is that the passage of a proposal is a highly endogenous
12:360:29323:22:22:54:557:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcome, andDftis unlikely to be independent of the error term [E(Dft,uft)6=0], such that the
12:361:29416:22:21:54:196:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimate ofbθwill be biased.
12:362:29444:21:22:71:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:To get a consistent estimate, we would ideally want "passing" a proposal to be a randomly
12:363:29533:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:assigned variable. The regression discontinuityframework that exploits the vote shares helps us
12:364:29628:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:approximate this ideal setup because in an arbitrarily small interval around the discontinuity (the
12:365:29727:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:thresholdv∗), whether the proposal passed or failed is random (e.g., whether a proposal passes
12:366:29821:22:22:53:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by 50.1% or fails by 49.9% is random).  Lee (2008) formally shows that, as long as there is a
12:367:29914:22:21:53:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:random component to the vote, the assignment into "treatment" (pass andDft=1) and "control"
12:368:30005:21:22:54:557:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f5:groups (fails andDft=0) is random around the threshold.11This implies that our estimate ofbθ
12:369:30097:22:22:53:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:using the regression discontinuity design is immune to bias from omitted variables —such asfirm
12:370:30192:22:21:53:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:announcements— even if they are correlated with the vote, as long as their effect is continuous
12:371:30287:21:22:53:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:around the threshold. Therefore, by comparing the outcomeyftof votes that barely passed to the
12:372:30381:22:22:54:558:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcome of votes that barely failed, we get a consistent estimate of the value of a new governance
12:373:30479:22:21:54:77:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rule.
12:374:30484:21:22:71:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In order to use all our data and improve efficiency, we follow the standard approach (see Lee and
12:375:30581:22:22:53:557:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Lemieux, forthcoming) and assume that we can approximate the underlying relationship between
12:376:30673:22:21:53:558:327:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:yftandvft,with a polynomial in the vote share. This polynomialflexibly captures the underlying
12:377:30767:21:22:54:558:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:relationship between the vote share and the outcome variable, such that any discontinuous jump at
12:378:30864:22:22:54:558:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the threshold is captured byθ.Allowing for a different polynomial for observations on the right-hand
12:379:30964:22:43:54:516:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:side of the thresholdPr(vft,γr)and on the left-hand side of the thresholdPl(vft,γl)gives:
12:380:31053:43:31:197:558:219:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:yft=Dftθ+Pr(vft,γr)+Pl(vft,γl)+uft.(3)
12:381:31091:31:22:71:558:188:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f13:This estimate,bθ, is precisely the estimate ofZfrom section 2.2 (Figure 1). Therefore, whenyft
12:382:31185:22:18:54:516:166:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are abnormal returns, the regression discontinuity model yields a consistent estimate ofZ.

12:384:31386:15:0:54:338:133:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:be large for our purposes, given that we perform a local analysis.

14:416:34153:21:22:53:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:during the event window). Information is mostly released on the day of the vote, but, in any case,
14:417:34251:22:44:53:402:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:this dynamic structure would capture any effect in subsequent days.

14:419:34340:29:22:54:558:601:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Next, we need tofind a way to aggregate all votes for a givenfirm and meeting date. To illustrate
14:420:34437:22:21:53:558:579:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:how we do this, wefirst ignore dynamics and use the simple (non-dynamic) equation (3). Imagine
14:421:34531:21:22:53:558:558:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that thefirm could vote on two issues, A and B, on any given date. Then, we would extend equation
14:422:34628:22:61:53:344:536:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f6:(3) to allow for two different kinds of votes to affectyft:

14:425:34864:21:22:54:558:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is that there are not just two types of governance proposals but 72 (see Appendix A). Given that
14:426:34960:22:22:54:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:we identify effects only around the discontinuity, the number of observations limits how much we
14:427:35056:22:21:54:557:370:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f6:can separate out the effects. However, under the assumption that for allAandB:θA=θB=θ;

15:461:36410:22:50:54:558:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mental Appendix, Table A shows that our results are robust to the use of higher-order polynomials).
15:462:36509:50:33:54:558:581:301:g_d0_f1:301:g_d0_f1:4  Election votes as a quasi-experiment: vote distribution
15:463:36567:33:34:83:314:548:301:g_d0_f1:301:g_d0_f1:and pre-existing differences
15:464:36595:34:21:54:558:514:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The basic assumption of the regression discontinuity design is that around the threshold, passing a
15:465:36694:21:22:54:558:493:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal is as good as random assignment. Here, we provide a standard test of this assumption that
15:466:36792:22:22:54:558:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:consists in evaluating whether thedistribution of votes is continuous around the majority threshold.
15:467:36892:22:21:54:558:449:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Figure 3 shows the distribution of the vote share (the percentage of votes in favor) for all votes
15:468:36990:21:22:54:558:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in our sample. If there were sharp changes in that distribution around the threshold, this would
15:469:37086:22:22:54:558:406:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:indicate that the probability of falling on either side of the threshold is discontinuous and that
15:470:37184:22:21:54:557:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the main identification assumption is likely not to hold (McCrary, 2008). Figures 4 and 5 show
15:471:37278:21:22:54:558:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the distribution of votes separately for proposals to remove anti-takeover provisions (those included
15:472:37379:22:22:54:558:341:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the G-index), and Other proposals to increase shareholder control (including compensation,
15:473:37472:22:21:54:558:319:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:board-related and auditor-related proposals). In these, we also see that the distribution is smooth
15:474:37571:21:22:54:558:298:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:around the threshold.13Listokin (2008) also reports a smooth distribution of shareholder-sponsored
15:475:37669:22:22:53:557:276:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposals around the majority threshold as evidence of lack of strategic behavior. In contrast, he
15:476:37767:22:22:53:557:254:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shows that management proposals (which are excluded from our analysis) display a very sharp
15:477:37858:22:21:53:557:232:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discontinuity in the density of votes at the majority threshold; essentially, these rarely fail to pass,
15:478:37962:21:22:53:450:211:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as management strategically withdraws those proposals that are likely to fail.
15:479:38040:22:21:71:557:189:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Figures 4 and 5 also show that anti-takeover proposals are more likely to fall around the dis-
15:480:38134:21:22:53:558:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:continuity. Since our estimates are identified only from observations around the discontinuity, this
15:481:38234:22:22:53:557:146:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implies that most of the effect we estimate comes from the passage of anti-takeover provisions. It
15:482:38332:22:21:53:557:124:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:also limits the extent to which we can try to identify the effects of different subgroups since we do
15:483:38433:21:18:54:319:103:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:not have enough observations around the threshold.
15:484:38483:18:16:63:558:85:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:13We performed the density test for smoothness of the vote share suggested in McCrary (2008) and could not
15:485:38589:16:0:53:493:69:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reject smoothness around the majority threshold. [See Supplemental Appendix Figures SA2 to SA4].
16:486:38687:0:22:71:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A second standard test of the regression discontinuity design consists in evaluating whether
16:487:38779:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:prior to the day of the vote, there were systematic differences in the characteristics offirms that
16:488:38878:21:22:54:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fall on either side of the threshold. If one found systematic differences in characteristics offirms
16:489:38978:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that just pass, relative to those that just fail to pass a proposal, then the main assumption of the
16:490:39078:22:21:54:557:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:design is likely to be violated. Thefirst column in each panel of Table 3 looks atfirms where a
16:491:39173:21:22:54:558:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal passes and those where a proposal fails and evaluates whether there is a difference in a
16:492:39270:22:22:54:557:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:number offirm characteristics in the period before the meeting. The regressions in column 1 do

16:495:39546:22:22:54:562:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on either side of the threshold, so that they estimate the effectatthediscontinuity. Weseethat
16:496:39640:22:21:54:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:there is no significant difference in abnormal returns on the day before the meeting (Panel A) or in

16:498:39839:22:22:54:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(Panel B). There is no difference in the growth rates of those variables, on average (column 3), and
16:499:39939:22:21:54:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:most importantly for our identification, around the discontinuity (column 4), which indicates the
16:500:40036:21:22:54:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:absence of pre-existing differences. Panel C examines two acquisitions variables (number and value
16:501:40134:22:22:54:445:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of acquisitions), and neither has significant differences around the threshold.
16:502:40213:22:21:71:558:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Next, we examine differences in ownership concentration for institutional owners (Panel E). As
16:503:40307:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mentioned, the presence of institutional owners is likely to be a determinant of the outcome of
16:504:40402:22:22:54:558:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the vote. In column 1, Panel E, wefind that, indeed, a proposal is more likely to pass infirms
16:505:40496:22:21:54:558:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:with a high reported concentration of institutional owners (measured as the sum of institutional
16:506:40592:21:22:54:558:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ownership for the topfive shareholders in the lastfiscal quarter before the meeting) or with more
16:507:40689:22:22:54:558:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:institutional owners that report to own at least 5% of shares outstanding.14This confirms the fact
16:508:40787:22:21:54:557:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that one cannot directly comparefirms with or without governance provisions in place since these
16:509:40883:21:22:54:558:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are different kinds offirms. However, once we include the polynomial in the vote share in column 2
16:510:40981:22:22:54:557:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of Panel D, we see that there is no significant difference around the threshold, which lends support
16:511:41081:22:21:54:209:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to our identifying assumption.
16:512:41111:21:22:71:558:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Similarly, one expects thatfirms with different levels of shareholder rights, as measured by the
16:513:41207:22:22:54:557:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:G-index, have different propensities to pass shareholders’ governance proposals. Column 1 of Panel
16:514:41305:22:21:54:557:132:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Eshowsthatfirms with a higher G-index (more anti-takeover provisions in place) are more likely to
16:515:41402:21:22:54:558:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:pass the shareholder proposals. However,firms around the vicinity of the discontinuity do not differ
16:516:41502:22:18:54:558:89:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:along this dimension, which further supports the paper’s basic identifying assumption.  Finally,
16:517:41598:18:0:63:535:71:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:14These two variables are computed using SEC Form 13F quarterlyfilings, provided by Thomson Financial.
17:518:41702:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:we also examine a number of additional meeting characteristics such as the number of proposals,
17:519:41797:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the number of withdrawn proposals prior to the annual meeting and the identity of the proponent
17:520:41892:21:22:54:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:andfind no evidence of pre-existing differences at the discontinuity (see Table B in Supplemental
17:521:41989:22:22:54:111:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Appendix).
17:522:41999:22:21:71:557:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Overall, our results show that there is no evidence of selection into either side of the discontinuity,
17:523:42102:21:51:54:208:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:based on observable variables.

17:527:42256:30:21:53:557:482:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Table 4 shows estimates of the difference in abnormal returns between proposals that pass and

17:530:42541:22:21:53:558:417:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and wefind that, as expected, there is no difference, on average, between those passing and those
17:531:42638:21:22:53:557:396:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:failing (a highly insignificant estimate of 0.0009) since the market incorporates the expectation in
17:532:42738:22:22:53:557:374:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the prices. Column 2 restricts the sample to within ten percentage points of the threshold, and
17:533:42833:22:21:53:557:352:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:here we begin to see a higher estimate (0.002— i.e., 0.2% daily abnormal return) and a smaller
17:534:42927:21:22:53:557:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:standard error. For votes withinfive percentage points of the threshold, the abnormal return is
17:535:43022:22:22:53:558:309:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:0.76% higher for those that passed (and this is significant at 1%), and as we narrow the window even
17:536:43122:22:21:53:557:287:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:further to two percentage points (column 4) and one percentage point (column 5), the abnormal
17:537:43215:21:22:53:557:266:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:return of passing increases to 1.05% and 1.39%, respectively. These are still significant, even though
17:538:43317:22:22:53:557:244:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the number of observations falls as we narrow the window. Panels B and C of Table 4 show the
17:539:43409:22:21:53:557:222:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:same set of regressions for anti-takeover provisions and all other proposals pooled, respectively.
17:540:43507:21:22:53:557:201:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Wefind a similar pattern, with most of the effect being driven by anti-takeover provisions. This
17:541:43603:22:22:54:558:179:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is partly because there are more G-index proposals that fall around the discontinuity, so we can
17:542:43699:22:21:54:557:157:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimate them more precisely.It also reflects the fact that G-index proposals are thought to have a
17:543:43798:21:22:54:558:136:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:potentially more important impact in insulating managers to pursue their private goals. Within one
17:544:43896:22:22:54:558:114:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:percentage point of the interval, passing an anti-takeover provision yields a 2.2% abnormal return
17:545:43994:22:21:54:171:92:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on the day of the vote.
17:546:44017:21:22:71:558:71:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Finally, column 6 makes use of all the data in the sample (as described in section 3.1) and
17:547:44108:22:0:54:558:49:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:introduces two polynomials of order four in the vote share, one on each side of the threshold (as in
18:548:44210:0:22:54:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equation (3) above). Using this model, we estimate that the effect of passing a proposal is 1.3%,
18:549:44307:22:21:54:477:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:which is very close to the results of the unrestricted models of the earlier columns.
18:550:44392:21:22:71:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Figure 6 shows the day-by-day difference in abnormal returns betweenfirms where a proposal
18:551:44482:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passes or fails withinfive percentage points on either side of the majority threshold. We observe a
18:552:44581:22:21:54:557:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:clear peak in the difference in returns betweenfirmsthatpassandfirms that do not pass a proposal

18:554:44759:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:For other days around the annual meeting, there are no clear spikes or discernible pattern. This
18:555:44855:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shows that the market incorporates the outcome of the vote on the day of the vote itself —when the
18:556:44953:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcome is known— and not before. It also seems that there are no further additional returns on

18:559:45165:21:22:54:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that several proposals can be voted on in one day; that the effect of the vote could potentially
18:560:45261:22:22:54:558:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:persist over more than one day; or that the returns are likely to be correlated over time, given that
18:561:45362:22:21:54:558:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:they respond to the same events. In order to incorporate these characteristics of the data, we use
18:562:45460:21:22:54:558:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the full model described in equation (7). The results are shown in Table 5. Column 1 displays
18:563:45553:22:22:54:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the effect of passing a proposal on the meeting date (t), the day after(t+1)and the cumulative
18:564:45647:22:21:54:558:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect fromt+2tot+7.Wefind that most of the effect (1.3% abnormal return) is on the day
18:565:45734:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the vote, when the surprise around the threshold occurs. The following days yield around 0.2%
18:566:45830:22:22:54:558:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:daily abnormal returns, but these are insignificant. Column 2 shows similar results using a different
18:567:45931:22:21:54:557:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model to compute the daily abnormal returns (a standard one-factor market model instead of the
18:568:46025:21:22:54:476:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:three-factor Fama-French with momentum that we use in the rest of the analysis).
18:569:46105:22:22:71:557:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Overall, wefind that most of the effect on prices occurs on the day of the vote. In column 3,
18:570:46198:22:21:54:557:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:we explore further what happens on that day by allowing for a moreflexible specification of the
18:571:46293:21:22:54:558:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect of the number of votes on daily returns (recall that the model in equation (7) sums over the
18:572:46392:22:22:54:557:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:votes of the day to aggregate over all the different outcomes). Here, we allow for different dummy
18:573:46490:22:21:54:558:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:variables for the number of proposals that passed, with a maximum of six proposals passing in a
18:574:46585:21:22:54:558:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:given meeting day. Wefind that the effect is monotonically increasing and approximately linear in
18:575:46682:22:22:54:557:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the number of proposals, such that the model in Section 3.3 is appropriate (the effect of passing one
18:576:46783:22:21:54:558:132:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal is 1.3%, similar to our baseline estimate; passing two proposals yields a 2.2% abnormal
18:577:46879:21:22:54:557:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:return; three and four proposals yield a total of 4.6% returns, etc.). Columns 4 and 5 allow for
18:578:46975:22:22:54:557:89:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:adifferent effect of the two kinds of proposals: the set of anti-takeover provisions included in the
18:579:47075:22:0:54:558:67:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:G-index and the set of Other proposals. Among these Other (non G-index) proposals, the ones that
19:580:47173:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fall more frequently around the discontinuity are proposals to increase board independence from
19:581:47268:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:management and proposals to expense stock options (see Appendix A). We confirm that most of the
19:582:47363:21:22:53:558:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect is driven by anti-takeover proposals —in particular, by proposals to repeal a classified board
19:583:47464:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and to eliminate poison pills (see Appendix A). However, we alsofind positive, albeit somewhat
19:584:47558:22:21:53:557:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:smaller and less precisely estimated effects of other kinds of proposals, which have received less
19:585:47656:21:22:54:189:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:attention in the literature.
19:586:47684:22:22:71:557:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In sum, wefind that there is a significant 1.3% average price reaction to proposals that pass
19:587:47777:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by a small margin relative to those that fail by a small margin.15We argue that the regression
19:588:47871:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discontinuity design allows us to obtain a causal estimate, that is not driven by omitted variables,
19:589:47971:22:22:54:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unobservedfirm characteristics or other events. The positive price reaction on the day of the vote
19:590:48069:22:21:54:558:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:may reflect the idea that the governance improvement will lead to lower agency costs and higher
19:591:48164:21:22:54:558:501:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firm value; or it could also reflect a takeover premium. In Section 5.3 below, we study the long-term
19:592:48265:22:22:54:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effects of these votes to assess the evidence on these different possible explanations for the positive
19:593:48368:22:38:54:127:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:price reaction.

19:595:48435:29:22:53:558:390:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:It is likely thatfirms with different characteristics may have different quantitative responses to
19:596:48533:22:22:53:557:368:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing a governance proposal. To further investigate this potential heterogeneity in responses, we
19:597:48632:22:21:53:558:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:study the effect of governance proposals in different subsets of the data. In particular, we analyze
19:598:48732:21:22:54:557:325:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the differential response infirms according to the level of concentration of the topfive institutional
19:599:48834:22:22:53:557:303:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:owners, the intensity of anti-takeover protection in place at the time of the meeting (G-index), and
19:600:48934:22:21:53:295:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:whether thefirms had high R&D expenditures.
19:601:48977:21:22:71:557:260:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Wefind thatfirms with a higher concentration of large institutional owners respond more to
19:602:49067:22:22:53:557:238:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing a provision than dofirms with more-dispersed ownership. In particular, column 1 of Table
19:603:49163:22:21:53:557:216:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:6, shows that passing a shareholder proposal in concentrated-ownershipfirms elicits a 2% abnormal
19:604:49260:21:22:53:557:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:return on the day of the meeting, with a further cumulative 2.3% in the seven days after the meeting
19:605:49360:22:22:53:557:173:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(for G-index proposals —column 4— the cumulative return over seven days is 3.6% in concentrated-
19:606:49456:22:21:53:557:151:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ownershipfirms). This may reflect that thesefirms are more closely monitored and, therefore, the
19:607:49552:21:22:53:557:130:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal is more likely to be implemented, or that the value of these provisions is higher for these
19:608:49652:22:22:53:557:108:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firms —and that governance proposals and monitoring are complements in the governance structure.
19:609:49748:22:18:53:557:86:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We alsofind thatfirms with many anti-takeover provisions benefit more from the removal of takeover
19:610:49846:18:15:63:558:68:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:15This is a large and significant effect in contrast with the generally small or insignificant results found when using

20:613:50142:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing a G-index shareholder proposal yields a 1.9% abnormal return on the day of the vote and
20:614:50237:21:22:54:332:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a further 2.4% in the following seven days (column 5).
20:615:50291:22:22:71:557:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The previous analysis shows that, on average, passing a proposal that improves shareholder
20:616:50381:22:21:54:558:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rights increases shareholder value. However, it is possible that having excessive shareholder rights
20:617:50481:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in place can be detrimental tofirms if that leads managers to focus excessively on the short run at
20:618:50580:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the expense of the long run (Stein, 1988). If this were true,firms in which long-run investments
20:619:50676:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are important might respond negatively to these governance proposals. We proxy the long-term
20:620:50768:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nature offirms’ investment by their R&D expenditures. Columns 3 and 6 estimate our basic model
20:621:50862:22:22:54:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:forfirms with above-median R&D-to-assets ratio prior to the meeting. Wefind, in fact, that the
20:622:50956:22:21:54:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect for thesefirms (1.6%) is very similar to the result for the whole sample (1.3%), indicating
20:623:51054:21:22:54:557:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that there is no different response, at least along this dimension of long-run investment needs, and
20:624:51154:22:22:54:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that the change in abnormal returns from changes in the governance structure is also positive for
20:625:51251:22:21:54:112:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:thesefirms.
20:626:51262:21:22:71:558:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Finally, the regression discontinuity estimate is, by construction, the weighted average effect

20:628:51443:22:21:54:558:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expected (Lee and Lemieux, forthcoming). In our case, as mentioned, the elimination of staggered
20:629:51539:21:22:54:558:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:boards and poison pills represent 68% of G-index proposals falling around the discontinuity, implying

20:631:51686:22:21:71:557:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In terms of how much one can extrapolate the results of our analysis to otherfirms, one must
20:632:51778:21:22:54:558:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:take into account that, within listedfirms, those that are larger, less profitable and have a higher
20:633:51878:22:22:54:558:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f4:level of institutional ownership tend to be targeted by shareholder proposals more often (Karpoff
20:634:51975:22:21:54:557:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:et al., 1996; Romano, 2001). However, within the set offirms that are the target of a proposal, we
20:635:52073:21:22:54:557:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:know from Section 4 that there are no systematic differences betweenfirms on either side of the
20:636:52168:22:22:54:558:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:threshold which means there is no evidence of selection into treatment. We also can see in Figure
20:637:52265:22:21:54:557:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:4 that the mass of G-Index proposals actually is around the majority threshold. Still,firms with
20:638:52361:21:22:54:557:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:votes around the threshold may be different from otherfirms in our sample. In order to have a sense

20:643:52823:22:0:54:558:67:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:show thatfirms with vote shares around the discontinuity fall roughly in betweenfirms in the other
21:644:52923:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:two groups (e.g., the distribution of institutional ownership for proposals in the G-index is between
21:645:53024:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the other two groups, and so is the distributionof Tobin’s Q —Figure 7). Even though one cannot
21:646:53119:21:22:54:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:immediately generalize our results to allfirms, the evidence suggests thatfirms that fall around the
21:647:53219:22:38:54:526:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discontinuity are not "extreme" observations, but, rather,firms with average characteristics.

21:649:53381:30:21:54:558:606:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:While we do not have information on whether each proposal in our data was implemented, we know
21:650:53475:21:22:54:557:585:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:how the value of the G-index changes over time for mostfirms in our sample. The G-index is the
21:651:53569:22:22:54:558:563:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:number of anti-takeover provisions in place at a point in time. We can evaluate how it responds to
21:652:53667:22:21:54:558:541:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the passage of a provision at the discontinuity. This serves as a proxy for implementation. Column 1
21:653:53767:21:22:54:557:520:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of Table 7 shows the effect of passing a governance proposal on the G-index. The index is available
21:654:53866:22:22:54:562:498:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:only every two years, so thefirst coefficient is the effect on thefirstyearavailableafterthefocal
21:655:53963:22:21:54:558:476:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:meeting (this can be between one and two years after the meeting, depending on when the vote
21:656:54055:21:22:54:557:455:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:occurred relative to the G-index years), and the second coefficient is two years later, etc. Wefind
21:657:54154:22:22:53:558:433:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that the probability of implementation increasesdiscretelyaround the discontinuity; thus, proposals
21:658:54253:22:21:53:557:411:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that pass by a small margin are substantially more likely to be implemented relative to those that
21:659:54351:21:22:53:557:390:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fail. Passing a proposal reduces the G-index by 0.313, which we interpret as a 31.3% probability of
21:660:54450:22:22:53:557:368:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:removing an anti-takeover provision within two years. That number grows in subsequent years, and
21:661:54546:22:21:53:557:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:within four years, the probability is 50%. This indicates, in part that when a proposal is passed
21:662:54643:21:22:53:557:325:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:but not implemented, shareholders are likely to propose it again. Our estimates are consistent with
21:663:54742:22:22:53:274:303:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the results in Ertimur et al. (forthcoming).
21:664:54786:22:21:71:558:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Passing a governance proposal in a given meeting is also likely to affect the probability of
21:665:54878:21:22:53:557:260:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:submitting and passing other proposals in the future. Ex-ante, it is unclear whether it will increase,
21:666:54980:22:22:53:557:238:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:decrease or have no effect on those future probabilities. We assess these dynamic effects in our data
21:667:55081:22:21:54:558:216:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:using equation (8) and, as the dependent variable, the number of proposals that are submitted and
21:668:55178:21:22:54:558:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passed in each year. The variable is zero if there are no shareholder governance proposals, or if
21:669:55275:22:22:54:558:173:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:these do not pass. Table 8 shows the results. Column 1 includes the polynomial in the vote share
21:670:55371:22:21:54:558:151:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and shows that, around the discontinuity, passing a G-index proposal leads to 0.325 more proposals
21:671:55469:21:22:54:558:130:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:being passed the following year and 0.119 more two years later, and the positive effect declines and
21:672:55569:22:22:54:557:108:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:becomes insignificant after year four. The effect for other proposals is generally insignificant, or
21:673:55669:22:21:54:558:86:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:negative. The dependent variable in column 2 is the number of G-index proposals passed in each
21:674:55763:21:0:54:557:65:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:year, and the results indicate that the effect in column 1 is driven mainly by G-index proposals. This
22:675:55867:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is an important set of results that shows there is a substantial dynamic element to these proposals,
22:676:55967:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:with passing G-index proposals making it more likely that other proposals will be passed in the
22:677:56062:21:44:54:88:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:future.
22:678:56069:44:29:54:340:652:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:5.2  The value of a governance proposal
22:679:56108:29:22:54:558:623:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In the previous section, we found that passing a provision increased shareholders’ returns on the
22:680:56205:22:22:54:558:601:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:day of the vote by 1.3%. This is our estimate ofZ,asdefined in Section 2.2. However, we know that
22:681:56302:22:21:54:558:579:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the observed abnormal return is not the full expected increase in value from implementation. It is
22:682:56400:21:22:54:558:558:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:an expectation that accounts for the probability that the proposal will be implemented, plus further
22:683:56500:22:22:54:557:536:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effects of submitting and implementing governance proposals in the future. In order to recover the
22:684:56598:22:21:54:557:514:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:actual value of a proposal,W, using equation (2), we need to know (i) the probability that the
22:685:56692:21:22:54:558:493:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provision is implemented if passed, and (ii) the probability that other proposals will be passed and
22:686:56792:22:22:54:191:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implemented in the future.
22:687:56818:22:21:71:558:449:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We obtain estimates for these probabilities in two different ways. Thefirst is using the results
22:688:56914:21:22:54:558:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:from Table 7 with the G-index as a proxy for implementation. In the previous section, we showed
22:689:57009:22:22:54:558:406:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that passing a proposal reduces the number of G-index provisions by 0.31. We also found that
22:690:57101:22:21:54:557:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:two years later, the probability of implementationis 0.016 higher (0.329-0.313), and two years after
22:691:57201:21:22:54:558:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that, it is 0.174 higher (0.503-0.329), etc. With these probabilities in hand and assuming a discount
22:692:57302:22:22:54:557:341:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rate of 5%, we can use equation (1) to recover the value of a provision to thefirm. We estimate
22:693:57397:22:21:54:274:319:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that to be a2.8%increase in market value.
22:694:57438:21:22:71:557:298:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:As a second way to determine the value of a provision, we use different sources for the estimated
22:695:57535:22:22:54:558:276:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:probabilities that feed into equation (1). Ertimur et al. (forthcoming)find a 20.7% discrete change
22:696:57634:22:21:54:557:254:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the probability of implementation at the threshold (pI).16The probability that a proposal will
22:697:57731:21:22:53:558:233:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:beimplementedinthefuture(ppt+i) is equal to the probability that it will pass in the future times
22:698:57828:22:22:54:558:211:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the probability that it will be implemented conditional on passing. The average probability that a
22:699:57926:22:21:54:558:189:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal that passes will be implemented is 31.1% (Ertimur et al., forthcoming). And the estimated
22:700:58024:21:22:54:558:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:probability of passing a proposal in the future, given that a proposal was passed this year, is shown
22:701:58125:22:22:54:558:146:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in column 2 of Table 8. Using these probabilities in equation (2), we estimate that the value of
22:702:58221:22:21:54:396:124:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implementing a provision leads to a2.7%increase in market value.
22:703:58285:21:18:71:557:103:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Therefore, in our data, adopting a governance provision increases shareholder value by between
22:704:58379:18:16:63:557:85:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:16They estimate that the probability of implementation from proposals that obtain 50% to 60% of the vote in
22:705:58486:16:12:54:558:69:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:favor is 23.9%. The probability that a proposal that failed will be implemented is 3.2%. We obtain 20.7% as the
22:706:58597:12:0:54:477:57:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:difference between the two. See Table 1, Panel D and footnote 9 in Ertimur et al. (forthcoming).
23:707:58695:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f6:145:g_d0_f2:2.7%and2.8%,depending on how we compute the estimate.  This translates to an increase in

23:709:58872:21:22:54:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is US$22,400 million in 1996 US$) per proposal. This is an economically sizeable effect, especially
23:710:58971:22:22:54:557:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:when we consider thatfirms often drop several provisions in subsequent meetings. Dropping 2.5
23:711:59064:22:21:54:558:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provisions (one standard deviation of the G-index in the sample) translates into a predicted increase
23:712:59165:21:22:54:558:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in market value of 7%, implying that the economic consequences of poor governance arrangements
23:713:59259:22:44:54:148:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are non-negligible.
23:714:59278:44:29:54:306:565:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:5.3  Long-run effects of governance
23:715:59313:29:22:54:557:536:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In thisfinal section, we evaluate the effect of passing a governance proposal on long-termfirm
23:716:59407:22:21:54:557:514:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcomes. Evaluating these real effects is important for determining why thefirm’s market value
23:717:59502:21:22:54:558:493:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:increases following the improvement in shareholder rights and, in particular, following the removal
23:718:59601:22:22:54:558:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of anti-takeover provisions. The increase in market value could simply reflect that the increased
23:719:59698:22:21:53:557:449:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:probability of a takeover may lead to a takeover premium. It could also result from an improvement
23:720:59796:21:22:53:557:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in internal governance and managerial discipline. This would be the case if weak shareholder rights
23:721:59895:22:22:53:557:406:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provided substantial protective power to standing managers (e.g., by insulating them from the
23:722:59988:22:21:53:557:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:takeover market), causing additional agency costs in the form of inefficient investments, reduced
23:723:60085:21:22:53:298:363:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:operational efficiency, and/or private benefits.17
23:724:60135:22:22:71:558:341:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:All regressions in Table9use the empirical model in equation (7) to estimate the effect of
23:725:60225:22:21:54:558:319:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:passing a governance proposal on a number of long-term outcomes and, distinguish between the
23:726:60317:21:22:54:557:298:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect of anti-takeover and Other proposals.18Since we are looking at effects up to 4 years after
23:727:60414:22:22:54:557:276:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the vote, for proposals at the end of the sample we cannot estimate the long-run effects. This is
23:728:60511:22:21:54:558:254:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:particularly problematic for Other proposals because they are more frequent towards the end of the
23:729:60609:21:22:54:558:233:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:sample (only 47 observations fall close to the discontinuity prior to 2004), so one should interpret
23:730:60709:22:22:54:558:211:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the long-run results for those with caution, especially at long durations. All regressions include
23:731:60807:22:21:54:557:189:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firm-meetingfixed effects, and cluster standard errors byfirm. In addition, our identification comes
23:732:60907:21:18:54:557:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:from the different response of afirm that passes a proposal by a small margin, relative to one that
23:733:61006:18:16:63:557:150:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:17Previous studies found that the presence of weak shareholders’ rights was correlated with higher levels of acqui-
23:734:61121:16:12:54:558:134:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:sitions and capital expenditures (as proxies for agency costs), lower valuation (as measured by Tobin’s Q and book
23:735:61235:12:12:54:557:122:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to market) and mixed results regarding accounting returns (return on equity and return on assets) (e.g., Gompers
23:736:61347:12:8:54:286:110:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:et al., 2003; Bebchuck et al., 2004; Core et al., 2006).
23:737:61403:8:16:63:558:102:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:18Financial ratios and other dependent variables used in Table 9 typically have significant outliers. To avoid the
23:738:61517:16:11:54:557:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:effect of influential observations, for each column of Table 9 we restrict the sample tofirm/votes that do not have
23:739:61632:11:12:53:557:75:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:any observation in the top or bottom 5% of the distribution of the dependent variable. The results are not sensitive
23:740:61748:12:0:53:389:63:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to this particular outlier cut-off, but are sensitive to the inclusion of outliers.
24:741:61833:0:22:54:557:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fails to pass a proposal by a small margin. This very demanding identification in terms of data
24:742:61928:22:21:54:329:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:requirements is bound to yield larger standard errors.
24:743:61982:21:22:71:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Columns 1 and 2 examine, respectively, whether the number and the value of acquisitions made
24:744:62074:22:22:54:558:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by afirm change significantly in the years following the improvement in shareholder rights. Column

24:746:62267:21:22:54:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:they have also been associated with empire-building incentives and excess of free cash-flow problems
24:747:62367:22:22:54:557:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that do not necessarily maximize shareholders’ value.19Some also argue that management entrench-
24:748:62463:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ment can lead to overinvestment or increases in corporate slack (Garvey and Hanka, 1999; Bertrand
24:749:62560:21:22:54:558:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Mullainathan, 2003; Giroud and Mueller, 2007). Therefore, one way in which improved gover-
24:750:62654:22:22:54:558:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nance can affect performance is through the reduction in unnecessary acquisitions, investments and
24:751:62752:22:21:54:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:capital-expenditures growth. We compute the number and value offirm acquisitions from the SDC
24:752:62845:21:22:54:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:database, which records all transactions of at least 5% of market value. The number of acquisitions
24:753:62944:22:22:54:558:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is defined as the count of acquisitions made in a year, and the value is computed as the sum of all
24:754:63043:22:21:54:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:acquisition prices paid, divided by the average market capitalization on thefirst and last day of the
24:755:63144:21:22:54:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:year.20Wefind that removing an anti-takeover provision reduces the number of acquisitions made
24:756:63238:22:22:53:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the years following the vote (column 1). The number falls by 0.03 the year after the vote, 0.17
24:757:63336:22:21:53:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:two years later and 0.18 three years later (only this last coefficient is significant, though). Wefind
24:758:63438:21:22:53:557:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a similar pattern for the value of these acquisitions (column 2). Column 3 shows that the growth
24:759:63534:22:22:53:557:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of capital expenditures also seems to decline after a vote to eliminate G-index provisions. For other
24:760:63635:22:21:53:557:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:types of provisions, the effect is reversed, and capital expenditures actually increase a few years
24:761:63734:21:22:53:557:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:after the vote, but this is subject to the limitations of the data for those proposals at long durations
24:762:63838:22:22:53:145:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mentioned earlier.

24:765:64040:22:22:54:563:219:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:measures of long-term valuation and performance.  Column4ofTable9showsthatTobin’sQ
24:766:64122:22:21:54:557:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:increases significantly as a result of passing the governance proposals (both G-index and Other).

24:770:64521:8:12:63:313:134:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:20We use the same measures as in Gompers et al. (2003).
24:771:64576:12:16:63:557:122:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:21Tobin’s Q is defined as the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets, where the market
24:772:64682:16:12:54:558:106:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:value of assets is computed as book value of assets (Compustat item: AT) plus the market value of common stock

24:775:65009:12:12:54:558:71:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:combined with the market value of common equity at the calendar end of year t. Book-to-market ratio is the ratio

25:777:65234:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is significant for both types of proposals. We alsofind evidence that return on equity (column6)
25:778:65330:22:21:54:380:717:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:increases, but this is not significant for the G-index proposals.22
25:779:65397:21:22:71:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Overall, wefind that, as a result of the removal of anti-takeover provisions, acquisitions and
25:780:65491:22:22:54:557:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:capital expenditures fall,firm valuation increases in the long-run, but there is little effect on earnings.
25:781:65598:22:21:54:558:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:While some of these effects are imprecisely estimated, taken as a whole, the above results indicate
25:782:65697:21:22:54:558:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that acquisitions and capital expenditures fall as a result of the removal of anti-takeover provisions,
25:783:65800:22:22:54:558:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and thatfirm valuation increases in the long run. This suggests that the abnormal returns that
25:784:65894:22:21:54:558:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:we identified in earlier sections as a result of governance improvements lead to actual changes
25:785:65989:21:22:53:557:566:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in managers’ actions. Further, if one is willing to interpret the marginal acquisitions and capital
25:786:66088:22:22:53:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expenditures as value-destroying, and a way in which managers extract private benefits (e.g., though
25:787:66188:22:21:53:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:empire-building), then our evidence suggests that corporate governance proposals that remove anti-
25:788:66286:21:22:53:557:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:takeover provisions increases shareholder value through the disciplining of management and the
25:789:66380:22:51:53:185:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reduction in agency costs.
25:790:66406:51:33:54:195:428:301:g_d0_f1:301:g_d0_f1:6Conclusion
25:791:66417:33:22:54:558:395:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we present novel evidence on the causal effect of corporate governance provisions on
25:792:66516:22:22:54:558:373:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:thefirms’ market value and long-term performance. We use a regression discontinuity model on
25:793:66608:22:21:54:558:351:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the outcomes of votes on governance proposals in shareholder meetings. Firms that pass a proposal
25:794:66705:21:22:54:558:330:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by a close margin are ex-ante similar to those that reject it by a close margin, so that passing a
25:795:66803:22:22:54:558:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provision is "locally" exogenous, leading to a discrete increase in the probability of implementation.
25:796:66905:22:21:54:558:286:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Therefore, this approach provides a causal estimate and overcomes the endogeneity problems that
25:797:67000:21:22:54:558:265:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:have affected the literature thus far. Our empirical strategy allows us to recover an estimate of the
25:798:67101:22:22:54:558:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:effect of governance even if, prior to the vote, the market had already incorporated the probability
25:799:67201:22:21:54:558:221:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of passing the shareholder proposal into stock prices. This is because proposals that fell around
25:800:67298:21:22:54:558:200:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the majority threshold were ex-ante the most uncertain, such that investors could not perfectly
25:801:67393:22:22:54:558:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:predict whether or not they would pass. It is for these proposals that we are able to observe a price
25:802:67494:22:21:54:98:156:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reaction.
25:803:67503:21:22:71:557:135:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We show that, on average, the market reacts to the passage of a governance-related shareholder
25:804:67597:22:21:54:557:113:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:proposal with positive abnormal returns around 1.3% on the day of the vote.  This reflects an
25:805:67690:21:9:54:454:92:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:year). Book value of common equity is the sum of book common equity and deferred taxes.
25:806:67777:9:15:63:558:83:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:22Return on Equity (ROE) is defined as net income (NI) divided by the book value of common stock (CEQ) plus
25:807:67884:15:0:54:347:68:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:balance sheet deferred taxes and Investment tax credit (TXDITC).
26:808:67950:0:22:54:558:739:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:increase in market value of between 2.7% and a 2.8% per implemented proposal. We identify some
26:809:68044:22:21:54:558:717:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity of this reaction, with the effect being more pronounced amongfirms with concentrated
26:810:68142:21:22:53:557:696:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ownership, high pre-existing anti-takeover provisions and high R&D expenditures. Firm behavior
26:811:68236:22:22:53:557:674:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:also changes with the new governance structure: Dropping anti-takeover provisions leads to lower
26:812:68332:22:21:53:558:652:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:investments and fewer acquisitions. Finally, the long-term performance of thefirm, measured as
26:813:68426:21:22:53:557:631:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Tobin’s Q or book-to-market ratios, improves after two or three years when anti-takeover provisions
26:814:68525:22:22:53:449:609:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are dropped; but wefind modest results with respect to the return on equity.
26:815:68601:22:21:71:557:587:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:As a whole, our results suggest that changing the internal corporate governance in targeted
26:816:68692:21:22:53:558:566:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:firms is rewarded by the market —with more pronounced effects for proposals to remove anti-takeover
26:817:68791:22:22:53:557:544:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:provisions—, and yields performance improvements in the long run. Our results also suggest that the
26:818:68890:22:21:53:557:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:channels behind these improvements include more conservative investment and acquisition policies.
26:819:68987:21:22:71:558:501:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Overall, our results provide causal evidence that the costs of the agency problem for modern
26:820:69079:22:22:53:557:479:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:corporations are non-negligible. A better understanding of the effect of governance provisions, and
26:821:69178:22:21:53:557:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the magnitude of the agency problem is crucial to guiding the public debate on the adequacy of
26:822:69272:21:22:53:557:436:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:implementing and regulating corporate governance. It is also important to understand the potential
26:823:69370:22:22:53:557:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:role of shareholder activism in improving the governance offirms and creating value. Only causal
26:824:69466:22:21:53:557:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimates can be used to infer the impact of changing internal governance structures, such as the
26:825:69563:21:22:53:557:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:level of protection from takeover, compensation arrangements or board independence. This paper is
26:826:69660:22:34:53:558:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:an important step towards a better understanding of the effects of current governance arrangements.

33:1016:78951:13:13:104:454:660:99:Times:99:Times:held firms. The threshold for approval is 50% for all but ten observations. We take into 
33:1017:79040:13:12:104:433:647:99:Times:99:Times:account the different threshold rules across proposals and firms for computing the

34:1045:79972:14:12:74:516:698:100:Times:100:Times:Our sample of 3,984 proposals corresponds to 2,205 firm-year observations. Abnormal Returns are computed 
34:1046:80077:12:13:74:515:686:100:Times:100:Times:from CRSP. G-index is the number of anti-takeover provisions in place at the firm (Source: Riskmetrics). All 
34:1047:80186:13:13:74:532:673:100:Times:100:Times:accounting variables are obtained from Compustat: Total assets (AT), Market Value (mkvalt_f), Capital expenses 
34:1048:80297:13:12:74:518:660:100:Times:100:Times:(CAPX). Tobin's Q is defined as the market value of assets (AT+mkvalt_f-CEQ) divided by the book value of 
34:1049:80403:12:13:74:532:648:100:Times:100:Times:assets (AT), and balance sheet Deferred Taxes and Investment Tax Credit (TXDITC). Book-to-market is the ratio 
34:1050:80513:13:13:74:504:635:100:Times:100:Times:of book value of common equity (previous fiscal year) to market value of common equity (end of previous 
34:1051:80617:13:12:74:487:622:100:Times:100:Times:calendar year). Ownership by Top 5 Shareholders is the sum of institutional ownership for the top five 
34:1052:80720:12:13:74:520:610:100:Times:100:Times:shareholders in the last fiscal quarter before the meeting, and Institutional Shareholders that own at least 5% is 
34:1053:80835:13:13:74:486:597:100:Times:100:Times:the number of shareholders that own at least 5% of the firm’s stock (Source: Thomson 13F Database). 
34:1054:80935:13:12:74:533:584:100:Times:100:Times:Acquisitions Count is the number of acquisitions made in a year, Acquisitions Ratio is computed as the sum of all 
34:1055:81049:12:13:74:525:572:100:Times:100:Times:acquisition prices paid divided by the average market capitalization on the first and last day of the year (Source: 
34:1056:81165:13:13:74:522:559:100:Times:100:Times:SDC). All monetary values are in 1996 US$.  Note that the number of observations may change due to missing 
34:1057:81272:13:518:74:200:546:100:Times:100:Times:values in some of the variables.

35:1089:82027:14:12:52:501:698:100:Times:100:Times:Table 3 tests whether passing a vote on the meeting date is systematically related to firm characteristics prior to 
35:1090:82143:12:13:52:502:686:100:Times:100:Times:the meeting. Note that in Panel A t refers to days, while for the rest, t refers to years. Each row corresponds to a 
35:1091:82260:13:13:52:505:673:100:Times:100:Times:different dependent variable and each entry comes from a separate regression. Each entry in the table reports the 
35:1092:82374:13:12:52:490:660:100:Times:100:Times:coefficient on whether a proposal passed.  Columns 1 and 2 (3 and 4) report the estimated effect of passing a 
35:1093:82484:12:13:52:509:648:100:Times:100:Times:vote on outcome variable levels (changes) the year before the annual meeting, t-1 (between t-2 and t-1). Columns 
35:1094:82597:13:13:52:484:635:100:Times:100:Times:1 and 3 present estimates without controlling for a polynomial in the vote share and, therefore, estimate the 
35:1095:82707:13:12:52:493:622:100:Times:100:Times:average effect of passing relative to not passing. Columns 2 and 4 include the polynomial in the vote share of 
35:1096:82818:12:13:52:508:610:100:Times:100:Times:order 4 on each side of the threshold such that it effectively estimates the effect at the discontinuity.  All columns 
35:1097:82937:13:13:52:500:597:100:Times:100:Times:control for year fixed effects and standard errors (in parenthesis) are clustered at the firm level.  Significance at

36:1129:84175:13:13:96:469:686:99:Times:99:Times:the proposal passed.  Abnormal returns are computed using the Fama French and momentum 
36:1130:84262:13:12:96:462:673:99:Times:99:Times:factors from Carhart (1997). Column 1 estimates are based on the whole sample. Column 2 
36:1131:84350:12:13:96:486:661:99:Times:99:Times:restricts the sample to observations with a vote share within ten points of the threshold, column 3 
36:1132:84450:13:13:96:479:648:99:Times:99:Times:to five points and so forth. Column 6 introduces polynomial in the vote share of order 4, one on 
36:1133:84547:13:12:96:474:635:99:Times:99:Times:each side of the threshold, and uses the full sample. All columns control for year fixed effects;

39:1249:89098:27:13:122:456:680:99:Times:99:Times:Column 1 shows the effect of passing a governance proposal on the number of anti-
39:1250:89179:13:12:122:441:667:99:Times:99:Times:takeover provisions in place at the firm (the G-index). The index is provided by 
39:1251:89260:12:13:122:448:655:99:Times:99:Times:Riskmetrics every two years. The first coefficient (Year of vote, t) is the effect of 
39:1252:89346:13:13:122:453:642:99:Times:99:Times:passing a proposal on the G-index for the first year available in Riskmetrics that is 
39:1253:89432:13:12:122:451:629:99:Times:99:Times:at least six months after the meeting; the second coefficient is the effect two years 
39:1254:89518:12:13:122:436:617:99:Times:99:Times:after that, etc. Column 2 allows for 6 different dummy variables to capture the 
39:1255:89598:13:13:122:440:604:99:Times:99:Times:number of proposals (1 to 6) that passed at the meeting. The specification in all 
39:1256:89680:13:13:122:442:591:99:Times:99:Times:columns is given by equation 8. All columns control for year fixed effects, firm-

43:1377:97283:36:30:72:483:669:209:g_d0_f48:209:g_d0_f48:1  Derivation of the Price reaction on the day of the vote
43:1378:97341:30:20:72:504:639:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:In this Appendix we show how to calculate the average price expectation formed in the market prior
43:1379:97439:20:20:72:503:619:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:to observing a given vote outcomeE(W|v).Note that an explicit calculation of this function is not
43:1380:97536:20:19:72:503:599:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:necessary for our identification strategy; we only need it to be a continuous function around the vote
43:1381:97638:19:20:72:115:580:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:threshold.
43:1382:97648:20:20:86:503:560:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:The market reaction on the day of the vote, given that we observe a votev,is the difference
43:1383:97739:20:20:72:504:540:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:between the market value of thefirm after the vote and the average expected value before the vote
43:1384:97836:20:20:72:503:520:100:g_d0_f49:100:g_d0_f47:W(v)−E(W|v).If the market expected a votexbut the realized vote wasvwe can denote the
43:1385:97921:20:20:72:504:500:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:market expectation on that day asE(W|E(v)=x)and this event has a density probability function
43:1386:98014:20:20:72:504:480:100:g_d0_f49:100:g_d0_f47:f(v|E(v)=x).To calculateE(W|v)we need to take into account that a given realized vote outcome
43:1387:98107:20:19:71:503:460:100:g_d0_f49:100:g_d0_f47:vmay correspond to different prior expectations. ThereforeE(W|v)should take into account all
43:1388:98199:19:50:71:388:441:100:g_d0_f47:100:g_d0_f47:the possible combinations of prior expectations that may have lead tov:

46:1491:101495:23:13:74:504:705:99:Times:99:Times:This table presents regressions of the abnormal returns on t=0 on whether the proposal passed, allowing for 
46:1492:101603:13:13:74:530:692:99:Times:99:Times:polynomials of different order on the right hand side.  Abnormal returns are computed using the Fama French and 
46:1493:101715:13:12:74:537:679:99:Times:99:Times:momentum factors from Carhart (1997).  Columns 1-6 use two polynomials of increasing order in the vote share, v, 
46:1494:101828:12:13:74:548:667:99:Times:99:Times:one on each side of the threshold (right and left). Column 8 displays a unique polynomial of order 8. The specification 
46:1495:101948:13:13:74:518:654:99:Times:99:Times:is equation 8. All columns control for year fixed effects, firm-meeting fixed effects and distance to the election 
46:1496:102063:13:12:74:545:641:99:Times:99:Times:effects; standard errors in parentheses are clustered by firm. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are indicated

47:1527:102708:20:26:119:451:704:99:Times:99:Times: Pre-differences in Meeting Characteristics as a Function of the Vote Outcome
47:1528:102785:26:12:52:518:678:99:Times:99:Times:This table tests whether passing a vote on the meeting date is systematically related to meeting  characteristics. Each 
47:1529:102905:12:13:52:506:666:99:Times:99:Times:row corresponds to a different dependent variable and each entry comes from a separate regression. Each entry in 
47:1530:103018:13:13:52:491:653:99:Times:99:Times:the table reports the coefficient on whether a proposal passed.  Columns 1 and 2 report the estimated effect of 
47:1531:103130:13:12:52:513:640:99:Times:99:Times:passing a vote on outcome variable levels. Column 1 presents estimates without controlling for a polynomial in the 
47:1532:103245:12:13:52:497:628:99:Times:99:Times:vote share and, therefore, estimates the average effect of passing relative to not passing. Column 2 includes the 
47:1533:103359:13:13:52:476:615:99:Times:99:Times:polynomial in the vote share of order 4 on each side of the threshold such that it estimates the effect at the 
47:1534:103470:13:13:52:519:602:99:Times:99:Times:discontinuity.  All columns control for year fixed effects and standard errors (in parenthesis) are clustered at the firm 
47:1535:103592:13:81:52:431:589:99:Times:99:Times:level.  Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are indicated by *, **, and *** respectively.
