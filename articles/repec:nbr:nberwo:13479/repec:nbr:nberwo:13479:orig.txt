2:28:1441:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Obesity has been one of the fastest growing health concerns among children, particularly among disadvantaged
2:29:1549:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:children.  For children overall, obesity rates have tripled from 5% in the early 1970s to about 15%
2:30:1648:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:by the early 2000s.  For disadvantaged children, obesity rates are closer to 20%.  In this paper, we
2:31:1748:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:first examine the impact of various measures of disadvantage on children's weight outcomes over the
2:32:1847:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:past 30 years, finding that the disadvantaged have gained weight faster.  Over the same period, adult
2:33:1948:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:obesity rates have grown, and we expect parental obesity to be closely tied to children's obesity, for
2:34:2050:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:reasons of both nature and nurture.  Thus, examining changes in the parent-child correlation in BMI
2:35:2149:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:should give us some insight into the ways in which the environment that parents and children share
2:36:2247:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:has affected children's body mass, or into how the interaction of genes and environment has changed.
2:37:2347:14:14:72:539:462:12:Times:12:Times:We find that the elasticity between mothers' and children's BMI has increased since the 1970s, suggesting
2:38:2452:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:that shared genetic-environmental factors have become more important in determining obesity.  Despite
2:39:2553:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:the faster weight gain for the disadvantaged, there appears to be no clear difference for by disadvantaged
2:40:2659:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:group in either the parent-child elasticity or in identifiable environmental factors.  On average, the
2:41:2761:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:increases in parents' BMI between the early 1970s and the early 2000s can explain about 37 percent
2:42:2859:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:of the increase in children's BMI.  Although common environmental/genetic factors play a larger role
2:43:2959:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:now than in earlier time periods, child specific environments such as schools and day care play a potentially
2:44:3068:14:28:72:328:364:12:Times:12:Times:important role in determining children's health status.

3:65:3508:13:28:72:154:695:144:Times:144:Times:I.  Introduction 
3:66:3524:28:28:71:537:667:144:Times:144:Times: Obesity has been one of the fastest growing health concerns among children, particularly 
3:67:3613:28:27:72:535:639:144:Times:144:Times:among disadvantaged children.  Childhood obesity has risen starkly over the last three decades.  
3:68:3710:27:28:72:539:612:144:Times:144:Times:For children overall, obesity rates have tripled from 5% in the early 1970s to about 15% by early 
3:69:3808:28:27:72:519:584:144:Times:144:Times:2000s.  For disadvantaged children, the rates of obesity are even higher.  For example, in the 
3:70:3903:27:28:72:423:557:144:Times:144:Times:years 1999-2004, nearly 18% of low income children qualified as obese. 
3:71:3974:28:28:72:539:529:144:Times:144:Times: Obesity carries with it both short term and long term consequences.  Obese children have 
3:72:4063:28:27:72:532:501:144:Times:144:Times:higher incidences of type II diabetes, for example, and lower quality of life scores.  In addition, 
3:73:4163:27:28:72:526:474:144:Times:144:Times:obese children are much more likely than normal weight children to become obese adults, and 
3:74:4255:28:27:72:511:446:144:Times:144:Times:obese adults are more likely to suffer disability during their prime working years, and have 
3:75:4348:27:28:72:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:adverse health outcomes like hypertension, heart attack and cancer.  While the precise impact of 
3:76:4445:28:28:72:508:391:144:Times:144:Times:obesity on mortality remains a matter of debate, there is little debate that obesity increases 
3:77:4540:28:27:72:513:363:144:Times:144:Times:morbidity and its attendant health care costs.  Since disadvantaged children and adults have 
3:78:4633:27:28:72:533:336:144:Times:144:Times:higher rates of obesity than other segments of the population, they suffer more of the short term 
3:79:4731:28:27:72:295:308:144:Times:144:Times:and long term consequences of this condition. 
3:80:4777:27:28:72:539:281:144:Times:144:Times: Understanding the increase in childhood obesity is important for devising policies to deal 
3:81:4868:28:27:72:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:with this health problem.  Although recent research and policy activity surrounding this issue has 
3:82:4967:27:28:72:509:226:144:Times:144:Times:focused particularly on the food available to children through schools, there is a gap in our 
3:83:5061:28:28:72:536:198:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge when it comes to the impact of home environment on children’s obesity.  To address 
3:84:5154:28:27:72:535:170:144:Times:144:Times:this question, we ask, how does parental obesity relate to children’s obesity? Is this different for 
3:85:5255:27:28:72:529:143:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged families?  Have these relationships changed over time?  Parental obesity is very 
3:86:5350:28:27:72:531:115:144:Times:144:Times:closely tied to children’s obesity, for reasons of both nature and nurture.  First, there is a strong 
3:87:5452:27:0:72:473:88:144:Times:144:Times:genetic component to body composition.  Second, parents and children share many 
4:88:5533:0:27:72:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:environmental characteristics.  Additionally, parents have a great deal of influence over what 
4:89:5628:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:their children, particularly their young children, eat and how much energy they expend.  Since 
4:90:5723:28:27:72:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:genetics are unlikely to have changed dramatically over the past thirty years, if the correlation 
4:91:5821:27:28:72:492:626:144:Times:144:Times:between parents’ and children’s obesity has changed over time, then it is likely that the 
4:92:5911:28:28:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:environment and/or parental behavior has changed.  If the overall correlation has increased over 
4:93:6008:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:time, it suggests that something in the common environment (or decisions made by the family) is 
4:94:6104:27:28:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:affecting all family members. On the other hand, if the correlation has decreased over time, then 
4:95:6202:28:27:71:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:it suggests a larger role for something unique to the environment that children – but not their 
4:96:6298:27:28:72:408:488:144:Times:144:Times:parents – face, for example in child care settings and public schools.   
4:97:6371:28:28:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times: In addition, there may be important differences in the relationship between parents’ and 
4:98:6460:28:27:72:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:children’s obesity for disadvantaged children.  For example, if the parent-child correlation is 
4:99:6556:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:lower for the disadvantaged, then it suggests that the child-specific environmental factors may be 
4:100:6655:28:27:71:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:relatively more important for disadvantaged children.  Again, if the relationship is changing over 
4:101:6754:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:time, it provides clues as to changes in the environment that may be contributing to the changes 
4:102:6851:28:27:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:in obesity.  Thus, this paper focuses on a fundamental component of health status, obesity, for 
4:103:6947:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:which disadvantaged children have particularly poor outcomes.  It sheds light on how parents’ 
4:104:7041:28:28:72:486:267:144:Times:144:Times:health status is related to children’s health status, and how that relationship differs for 
4:105:7133:28:27:72:481:239:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged and advantaged children, and how the relationship changes over time. 
4:106:7216:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times: We find that the parent-child correlation in weight outcomes has increased substantially 
4:107:7305:28:27:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:since the early 1970s.  This suggests that the importance of the shared family environment or 
4:108:7399:27:28:72:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:genetic-environmental interactions has increased over time.  Despite the fact that disadvantaged 
4:109:7496:28:0:72:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:groups have higher obesity rates, parent-child weight outcomes are similar for advantaged and 
5:110:7591:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged groups.  On average, the observed increase in parents’ body-mass-index1 (BMI) 
5:111:7683:27:28:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:can explain about 37 percent of the increase in children’s BMI since the early 1970s.  Thus, for 
5:112:7780:28:27:71:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:advantaged and disadvantaged groups,  genetic tendencies toward obesity and how these 
5:113:7866:27:28:71:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:tendencies interact with the common environment are important, and increasingly so as obesity 
5:114:7960:28:28:71:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:rates have risen over time.  Nonetheless, for both advantaged and disadvantaged children there is 
5:115:8058:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:an important role in their health status is played by child-specific environments, which suggests 
5:116:8156:27:28:71:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:that policies affecting schools, day cares, playgrounds and the like may have an effect on 
5:117:8247:28:27:71:163:515:144:Times:144:Times:children’s obesity. 
5:118:8267:27:28:71:250:488:144:Times:144:Times:II. Previous Research in this Area  
5:119:8303:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times: Economic research on obesity has focused on changes in the (implicit) prices of food and 
5:120:8392:28:27:71:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:exercise that have increased caloric intake and reduced energy expenditure (Cutler, Glaeser and 
5:121:8488:27:28:71:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:Shapiro, 2003; Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002).  While this work is important, it is not clear 
5:122:8583:28:27:71:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:how well it applies to children, especially young children, who typically do not select the menu 
5:123:8680:27:28:71:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:of food presented to them, nor do they have complete control over how they spend their time.  
5:124:8774:28:27:71:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, work on childhood obesity has focused on changes in children’s environment that may 
5:125:8864:27:28:71:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:have tilted their energy balance toward consuming more calories and expending less energy.  For 
5:126:8960:28:28:71:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:example, work has focused on changes in maternal employment (Anderson, Butcher, Levine 
5:127:9047:28:27:71:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:2003), and changes in the food available to children through schools (Anderson and Butcher 
5:128:9138:27:28:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:2006b; Schanzenbach 2005), and how these changes in the two institutions, families and schools, 
5:129:9234:28:27:71:419:184:144:Times:144:Times:in which children spend most of their time, may have affected obesity.   
5:130:9307:27:28:71:541:157:144:Times:144:Times: There is, of course, a substantial literature outside economics on childhood obesity. Much 
5:131:9398:28:28:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:of this focuses on whether children who consume more of specific types of foods (e.g. fast food, 
5:132:9495:28:25:71:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:soda) or engage in particular activities (e.g. television watching, video game playing) are more

6:135:9710:0:27:72:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:likely to be obese (see Anderson and Butcher, 2006a for a summary of this literature).  In 
6:136:9801:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:addition, there is a large literature documenting that children from disadvantaged backgrounds 
6:137:9896:28:27:72:504:653:144:Times:144:Times:are more likely to have weight problems than others (see e.g. Strauss and Pollack, 2001).  
6:138:9987:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, there is a large literature documenting that there is an important genetic component of 
6:139:10084:28:28:72:265:598:144:Times:144:Times:obesity (see e.g. Stunkard et. al., 1990). 
6:140:10127:28:27:72:171:570:144:Times:144:Times:III. Our Approach 
6:141:10145:27:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times: What we believe is missing is a better understanding of whether the obesity epidemic in 
6:142:10233:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:children is simply part and parcel of the obesity epidemic in adults, or whether it represents a 
6:143:10330:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:related, but separate, phenomenon.  If we see a high correlation between children’s and parents’ 
6:144:10427:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:weight outcomes, then it suggests that increases in parents’ weight – or that the same factors that 
6:145:10527:28:27:72:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:led to parents’ weight gain -- can explain a large fraction of the increase in children’s weight.  
6:146:10626:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:This would be consistent with an explanation for the rise in children’s obesity where both parents 
6:147:10725:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:and children are faced with an adverse environment that leads to more obesity, or that parents 
6:148:10820:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:have always made determining choices about food and exercise that have affected their own and 
6:149:10914:28:27:72:477:322:144:Times:144:Times:their children’s weight – and in recent years these choices have been poor choices.   
6:150:11000:27:28:108:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:On the other hand, if we see that children’s weight outcomes are not highly correlated 
6:151:11087:28:28:72:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:with their parents, then it suggests that there are other, non-shared, factors that determine 
6:152:11181:28:27:72:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:children’s weight outcomes.  At any given point in time, there may be differences between 
6:153:11271:27:28:72:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:advantaged and disadvantaged children in how closely related children’s weight is to parents’ 
6:154:11365:28:27:72:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:weight.  For example, a parent who lives in a well-off neighborhood may walk to work for 
6:155:11454:27:28:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:exercise and may encourage her children to walk to school as well.  On the other hand, a parent 
6:156:11550:28:28:72:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:in a disadvantaged neighborhood may feel comfortable walking to work herself, but may be less 
6:157:11644:28:0:72:540:101:144:Times:144:Times:comfortable with her children walking to school due to safety concerns (traffic safety or criminal 
7:158:11744:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:activity, for example).  We would expect parents and children in the well-off neighborhood to 
7:159:11838:27:28:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:have more similar weight outcomes; while in the disadvantaged neighborhood parents and 
7:160:11925:28:27:71:536:653:144:Times:144:Times:children would have less closely linked weight outcomes.  Parent-child correlations may change 
7:161:12020:27:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:over time, and these changes may also differ between advantaged and disadvantaged children. 
7:162:12112:28:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:For both advantaged and disadvantaged children, we will discuss how much of the change in 
7:163:12202:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:children’s weight outcomes can be explained by parents’ weight outcomes, given the correlation 
7:164:12297:27:28:72:274:543:144:Times:144:Times:between the two in a given time period.    
7:165:12340:28:27:72:518:515:144:Times:144:Times: To address the question of how the parent-child correlation in BMI has changed over 
7:166:12424:27:28:72:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:time for disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged groups, we rely on data from the National Health 
7:167:12518:28:28:72:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  The nationally representative data were 
7:168:12602:28:27:71:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:collected in 1971-1974 (NHANES 1), 1976-1980 (NHANES 2), 1988-1994 (NHANES 3).  
7:169:12682:27:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:Beginning in 1999, the NHANES became a continuously running survey collected in 2-year 
7:170:12769:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:panels.  We pool the surveys from 1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 and refer to them (for 
7:171:12861:27:28:72:435:350:144:Times:144:Times:comparison’s sake) as “NHANES 4.” (See data appendix for more details). 
7:172:12933:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times: The NHANES are the most frequently used data for tracking obesity trends in the U.S. 
7:173:13018:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:population.  The data collection procedures include an examination component, so the children 
7:174:13112:28:28:72:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:in our sample were weighed and measured by trained personnel.  These measurements go into 
7:175:13202:28:27:72:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:our calculation of BMI for children.  For each of the first three NHANES, reported height and 
7:176:13296:27:28:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:weight is consistently available for the parents of examined children under age 12.  Thus, we 
7:177:13390:28:27:72:519:184:144:Times:144:Times:focus on children 2-11 years old.  In addition to the restrictions imposed by data availability, 
7:178:13487:27:28:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:questions about the impact of parental choices on children’s BMI may be particularly germane 
7:179:13580:28:28:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:for this group since adults are likely to have a greater influence over these children’s food and 
7:180:13678:28:0:72:538:101:144:Times:144:Times:exercise options than would be the case for teenagers.  In the fourth NHANES, reported parental 
8:181:13775:0:27:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:height and weight are not available, however, for both the third and fourth NHANES there are 
8:182:13868:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:enough children in the sample who have an adult household member who is also in the sample 
8:183:13959:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:that we can match children and adults within households and use measured heights and weights 
8:184:14052:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:for both children and adults.2  The Data Appendix describes more fully how we do the within-
8:185:14144:28:28:72:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:household matching and how this matched sample compares with the parental report sample in 
8:186:14235:28:27:72:259:570:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES 3, where both are available.

8:188:14271:28:27:72:243:515:144:Times:144:Times:IV. Changes in Obesity and BMI 
8:189:14302:27:28:72:189:488:144:Times:144:Times:A.  Measures of Obesity 
8:190:14325:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times: Obesity for adults is typically defined as having a BMI of 30 or above.  Children are 
8:191:14411:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:classified as obese if they have a BMI above the 95th percentile of an age-sex specific BMI 
8:192:14503:27:28:72:459:405:144:Times:144:Times:distribution (calculated with data that pre-dates the current increase in obesity).3 
8:193:14587:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times: One can also examine obesity using alternative measures of body composition.  BMI 
8:194:14669:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:does have drawbacks – in particular, muscular individuals may have a higher body-mass-index 
8:195:14761:28:27:71:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:than someone of the same build who is less muscular, and higher BMI in this case presumably 
8:196:14853:27:28:71:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:does not indicate a poor health outcome.  Ideally, one would like a measure of “fatness” that we 
8:197:14950:28:28:72:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:know is related to poorer health outcomes both within and across individuals.  Alternative 
8:198:15041:28:27:72:496:239:144:Times:144:Times:measures to BMI, for example, subscapular skin-fold measurements are available in the 
8:199:15127:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES.  While the levels of obesity sometimes differ by these different measures, the trends 
8:200:15221:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:in obesity over time show similar increases regardless of the measure chosen to define obesity 
8:201:15316:27:26:72:197:157:144:Times:144:Times:(Burkhauser et al., 2007). 
8:202:15343:26:7:72:219:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
8:203:15401:7:16:72:534:124:42:Times:100:Times:2 We can also match children to adults within the household in the first two waves of the NHANES, but this results 
8:204:15516:16:7:72:209:108:100:Times:100:Times:in losing about ¾ of our sample.   
8:205:15551:7:16:72:529:101:42:Times:100:Times:3 The nomenclature in the medical literature is different for children and adults. Children whose BMI is above the 
8:206:15666:16:0:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:95th percentile for their age-sex distribution are called “overweight” and those above the 85th percentile are called 
9:207:15785:0:27:72:489:708:144:Times:144:Times: Most researchers have chosen to focus on BMI since there tend to be very high 
9:208:15863:27:28:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:correlations between obesity rates as measured by any of the available outcomes, and BMI is 
9:209:15955:28:27:72:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:relatively easily measured in surveys.  A recent study on measuring obesity in children found no 
9:210:16052:27:28:72:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:additional information was gleaned from subscapular skinfold measurements once BMI was 
9:211:16139:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:accounted for (Mei, et. al., 2007).  Thus, we focus on BMI and obesity rates as defined by BMI 
9:212:16234:28:27:72:184:570:144:Times:144:Times:in our analysis below.4 
9:213:16257:27:28:72:220:543:144:Times:144:Times:B.  Measures of Disadvantage 
9:214:16286:28:27:90:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:Disadvantage is difficult to define, but has many correlates.  Our approach is to examine 
9:215:16376:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:BMI and obesity outcomes by several different potential measures of disadvantage.  We examine 
9:216:16470:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:differences in weight outcomes between race and ethnic groups, by educational attainment of 
9:217:16562:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:adults in the household, and by income-to-poverty line measures.  In general, these measures 
9:218:16655:27:28:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:give similar pictures of obesity levels and trends and the parent-child correlation in BMI for 
9:219:16750:28:27:72:273:377:144:Times:144:Times:advantaged and disadvantaged children.   
9:220:16791:27:28:72:180:350:144:Times:144:Times:C.  Trends in Obesity  
9:221:16814:28:27:90:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:Before turning to our investigation of children’s weight outcomes, it is worth establishing 
9:222:16906:27:28:71:516:295:144:Times:144:Times:how quickly adult obesity has been spreading throughout the United States.  Figure 1 shows 
9:223:16997:28:28:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:maps for 1990, 1995 and 2005 created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using 
9:224:17090:28:27:71:515:239:144:Times:144:Times:data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and 
9:225:17180:27:28:71:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:Prevention, 2007).  In 1990, in almost all states less than 15 percent of the adult population was 
9:226:17279:28:27:71:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:obese.  By 2005, many states have more than 25 percent of their adult population that is obese.  
9:227:17376:27:26:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:Given our interest in the role of disadvantage, it is important to note that states known to have a 
9:228:17476:26:12:72:542:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                           
9:229:17662:12:11:71:542:119:100:Times:100:Times:“at-risk-for-overweight.”  In order to simplify the discussion, we will use the adult terminology for both children and 
9:230:17782:11:7:71:102:108:100:Times:100:Times:adults.  
9:231:17791:7:16:72:516:101:42:Times:100:Times:4 We have also conducted many of our analyses using subscapular skinfold measurements and get very similar 
9:232:17898:16:0:71:423:85:100:Times:100:Times:results for the effect of disadvantage and for our parent-child correlations in outcomes.  
10:233:17990:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:relatively large poor population appear to be the leading edge of the obesity wave.  In 1990, it is 
10:234:18090:27:28:72:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:states such as West Virginia, Louisiana and Alabama that have over a 15% obesity rate.  
10:235:18178:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, by 2005, these same states, along with their neighboring states, have exceeded a 25% 
10:236:18274:27:28:72:136:626:144:Times:144:Times:obesity rate.  
10:237:18289:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times: Turning now to children, Figure 2 uses NHANES data to illustrate the differences across 
10:238:18377:28:27:72:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:time in obesity rates for children age 2 to 11 (the focus of our study), as well as demonstrating 
10:239:18475:27:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:the differences by the level of disadvantage for each time period.  Here we are using the income-
10:240:18572:28:27:72:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:to-poverty line ratio as our indicator of level of disadvantage, examining obesity rates for 
10:241:18665:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:children from families who fall into each quartile of the income-to-poverty-line ratio.5    This 
10:242:18762:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:figure clearly demonstrates the increase in obesity among children between 1971-1975 and 1999-
10:243:18856:28:27:72:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:2004.  As seen in the last set of bars, the overall percentage obese almost triples from 5 percent 
10:244:18955:27:28:72:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:in the earliest years to about 15 percent in the more recent years.  We can also see that this 
10:245:19050:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:increase over time applies to children in all family income groups.  Although children in each of 
10:246:19148:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:the family income groupings have increased their obesity rates, the gains have not all been the 
10:247:19244:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:same.  By the last period there is a clear gradient to children’s obesity, with the lowest family 
10:248:19342:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:income group having the highest fraction obese and children in the highest family income group 
10:249:19437:28:28:72:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:having the lowest fraction obese.  However, this gradient is not as clear in the earlier years. 
10:250:19533:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times: Focusing on the fraction obese may mask some important features of changes in obesity, 
10:251:19620:27:28:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:though. While an adult will be labeled as obese with a BMI greater than or equal to 30, it seems 
10:252:19717:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:unlikely that someone with a BMI of 30.1 will have much worse health outcomes than someone 
10:253:19808:27:26:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:with a BMI of 29.9.  Thus, if the increase in obesity is driven solely by small increases in BMI 
10:254:19905:26:7:72:219:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
10:255:19963:7:16:72:534:124:42:Times:100:Times:5 Information on family income itself is only available in bracketed form, but a continuous income-to-poverty ratio 
10:256:20079:16:12:71:533:108:100:Times:100:Times:measure is available in each year, which is a measure of reported family income relative to the poverty line.  Thus, 
10:257:20196:12:11:71:524:96:100:Times:100:Times:anything above 1 indicates the family’s income is above the poverty line for that time period, and as it increases, 
10:258:20312:11:0:71:162:85:100:Times:100:Times:families are better off. 
11:259:20339:0:27:72:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:that push individuals across a (somewhat) arbitrary threshold that labels obesity, then we might 
11:260:20436:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:not worry much about the future health consequences of these changes.  Since children’s obesity 
11:261:20532:28:27:72:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:status is determined by a similar comparison to a (in this case age and gender specific) threshold, 
11:262:20632:27:28:72:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:we want to examine what is happening to BMI among the obese, not just to the fraction of 
11:263:20721:28:28:72:275:598:144:Times:144:Times:children whose BMI is above the cutoff.   
11:264:20763:28:27:108:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:In fact, the obesity epidemic is generally characterized by an increase in weight among 
11:265:20851:27:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:those who are already heavy (Cutler et. al. 2003, Anderson et. al. 2003b).  Figure 3 shows how 
11:266:20946:28:27:71:506:515:144:Times:144:Times:average BMI among obese children has changed over time and by family income groups.  
11:267:21031:27:28:71:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:Average BMI among all obese children increased from 22.5 to 23.6 during this time period 
11:268:21120:28:28:71:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:(about a 5 percent increase).  In addition, by the later period we see a family income gradient 
11:269:21216:28:27:71:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:emerge in average BMI among the obese. In the first period, there is if anything a reverse 
11:270:21307:27:28:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:gradient – that is, the average BMI of the more advantaged obese children is higher than that of 
11:271:21404:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged obese children.  In the middle years, there is little systematic difference in the 
11:272:21501:27:28:72:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:BMI between advantaged and disadvantaged obese children.  By the later period, though, obese 
11:273:21594:28:27:72:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:children in the poorer families are heavier than obese children in wealthier families.  As 
11:274:21685:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:differences in BMI get larger between the obese and the non-obese, we expect that long term 
11:275:21777:28:28:72:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:health outcomes between them will also get larger.  It is important to keep in mind, however, that 
11:276:21876:28:27:72:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:differences in the age and sex composition across these groups and over time could be driving to 
11:277:21973:27:28:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:these changes in BMI levels.  In the next section we turn to regression analysis that allows us to 
11:278:22072:28:27:72:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:hold constant age and gender as we examine the changes in BMI by different measures of 
11:279:22159:27:28:72:147:157:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage.   
11:280:22175:28:0:72:371:129:144:Times:144:Times:D. Changes in BMI over Time by Measures of Disadvantage   
12:281:22234:0:27:72:501:708:144:Times:144:Times: We first present simple regressions of children’s log BMI on various measures of 
12:282:22315:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage for our four time periods.  These regressions control for a cubic in age, gender, and 
12:283:22414:28:27:72:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:interactions between these variables.6  This should account for the fact that as children age, we 
12:284:22512:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:expect their BMI to increase, and to increase at different rates for boys and girls.  We control for 
12:285:22613:28:28:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:age and gender in the regressions so that differences in BMI by measures of disadvantage will 
12:286:22707:28:27:72:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:not be due to differences in the age-sex composition across these groups.  Heteroskedasticity-
12:287:22801:27:28:72:433:543:144:Times:144:Times:robust standard errors are in parenthesis below the estimated coefficients.   
12:288:22879:28:27:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times: The top panel of Table 1 presents regressions of log BMI on racial and ethnic categories.   
12:289:22971:27:28:72:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:The second panel shows regressions of log BMI on the highest grade of the household reference 
12:290:23065:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:person.7  The third panel shows the results for the income-to-poverty ratio. The fourth panel 
12:291:23159:28:27:72:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:includes all measures of disadvantage simultaneously.  In all years, there is some evidence that 
12:292:23256:27:28:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged children are heavier, although the strength of that correlation varies with the 
12:293:23350:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:measure and the time period.  For example, black children do not have significantly higher BMIs 
12:294:23446:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:than white children prior to 1999, although in the 1988-1994 wave of the NHANES the point 
12:295:23536:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:estimate implies black children have an almost 1.0 percent higher BMI.  By the 1999-2004 wave, 
12:296:23631:27:28:72:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:that difference had increased to 2.1 percent and was statistically significant.  Currently, the 
12:297:23727:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:median 8-year-old girl stands at 4’2” and weighs 56 pounds, so we would expect her to be 1.2 
12:298:23820:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:pounds heavier if she were black. Hispanic children have significantly higher BMIs than white 
12:299:23914:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:non-Hispanic children in all but the first time period, and in the time periods when the difference 
12:300:24014:28:27:72:525:184:144:Times:144:Times:is statistically significant it is stable at about 3.5 percent.  For the same median 8-year-old girl 
12:301:24115:27:26:72:446:157:144:Times:144:Times:then, we would expect her to be about 2 pounds heavier if she were Hispanic. 
12:302:24192:26:7:72:219:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
12:303:24250:7:16:72:516:124:42:Times:100:Times:6 Note that sample sizes do not match those from later tables, as for these regressions we use all possible data.  
12:304:24365:16:7:71:446:108:100:Times:100:Times:Regressions run on consistent samples are not substantively different from those shown here. 
12:305:24458:7:16:72:534:101:42:Times:100:Times:7 For NHANES 4, we define the reference person as the father, if present, otherwise, it is the mother.  For the other 
12:306:24576:16:0:71:504:85:100:Times:100:Times:three panels, the reference person is defined within the NHANES.  See the Data Appendix for more details. 
13:307:24684:0:27:108:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:Being from a household where the reference person has a higher level of education is 
13:308:24769:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significantly negatively correlated with BMI in all four time periods, increasing from 
13:309:24870:28:27:72:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:a 0.2 percent lower BMI for each additional year of parental education in the early 1970s to a 
13:310:24965:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:0.6 percent reduction for each additional year by the early 2000s.   Prior to 1980, children from 
13:311:25063:28:28:72:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:families with higher income-to-poverty ratios did not have significantly lower BMIs.  After 
13:312:25155:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:1988, however, that correlation is negative and statistically significantly different from zero, and 
13:313:25256:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:becoming steeper over time.  By the last period, a from a family with income at the poverty line 
13:314:25353:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:would be about 2.4 percent heavier than one with income three times the poverty line, compared 
13:315:25448:27:28:72:310:488:144:Times:144:Times:to just 1.8 percent heavier in the previous period. 
13:316:25500:28:28:108:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:When we include all measures of disadvantage simultaneously, we find that once the 
13:317:25583:28:27:72:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:income-to-poverty ratio and education are held constant, being black is no longer significantly 
13:318:25679:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:positively correlated with BMI in any of the years, but being Hispanic is still associated with a 
13:319:25777:28:27:72:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:higher BMI in all but the first period.  Each additional year of education of the household 
13:320:25869:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:reference person is associated with a 0.1 to 0.5 percent reduction in BMI, but the effect is no 
13:321:25965:28:27:72:547:322:144:Times:144:Times:longer increasing over time, and in fact is not significantly different from zero in the final period.   
13:322:26070:27:28:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, in all but the third wave, the income-to-poverty ratio is significantly correlated with 
13:323:26167:28:28:72:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:children’s BMI, however in the first two periods the effect is positive.  Overall, then, these 
13:324:26262:28:27:72:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:regressions show that disadvantaged children are generally heavier, using a variety of measures 
13:325:26358:27:28:72:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:of disadvantage.   Additionally, for most of these measures, the effect of disadvantage has been 
13:326:26455:28:28:72:193:184:144:Times:144:Times:growing over time.   
13:327:26476:28:27:72:308:156:144:Times:144:Times:V. Parent’s and Children’s Weight Outcomes 
13:328:26519:27:0:72:190:129:144:Times:144:Times:A. Mothers and Fathers 
14:329:26544:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times: Parents and children share common genetics, and, if they live together, share a common 
14:330:26631:27:28:71:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:environment.  Thus, we expect to see a strong correlation between the BMI of parents and 
14:331:26720:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:children.  Note that the literature on nature versus nurture typically uses the standard behavioral 
14:332:26820:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:genetics model to carry out a decomposition of these two effects by assuming that an outcome is 
14:333:26916:28:28:72:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:a linear combination of the independent effects of genetics, shared family environment, and 
14:334:27008:28:27:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:unexplained factors.  Given that, in fact, genetics and the shared environment are unlikely to be 
14:335:27106:27:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:independent, it is typical to interpret the genes component as incorporating both the direct effect 
14:336:27206:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:of genes and the effect of the gene-environment interaction (Sacerdote, 2007).  Thus, while we 
14:337:27301:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:do not expect that the underlying genetic predisposition toward obesity will have changed over 
14:338:27396:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:the twenty or so years that childhood obesity has been increasing, examining changes in the 
14:339:27488:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:parent-child correlation in BMI should give us insight into the ways in which the environment 
14:340:27582:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:that parents and children share has affected children’s body mass, or into how the interaction of 
14:341:27680:28:27:72:309:377:144:Times:144:Times:shared genes and the environment has changed.   
14:342:27728:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times: We investigate the parent-child correlation in BMI by running regressions of log(Child’s 
14:343:27817:28:27:72:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:BMI) on log(Parent’s BMI). The coefficient on log(Parent’s BMI) tells us the elasticity of 
14:344:27908:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:children’s BMI with respect to their parents – a one percent change in parent’s BMI is correlated 
14:345:28006:28:28:72:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:with what percent change in children’s BMI.   A larger elasticity implies a greater role for the 
14:346:28103:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:common environment and genes that parents and children share; a smaller elasticity implies a 
14:347:28196:27:28:72:430:212:144:Times:144:Times:greater role for environments that children do not share with their parents. 
14:348:28273:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times: Table 2 presents regressions of the log of child’s BMI on his or her mother’s log BMI 
14:349:28359:27:28:72:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:(column 1), his or her father’s BMI (column 2), and both simultaneously (column 3).  These 
14:350:28450:28:0:72:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:regressions control for race, ethnicity, education of the reference person, the family’s income-to-
15:351:28551:0:27:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:poverty ratio, and a cubic in the child’s age fully interacted with gender.8  The results in the first 
15:352:28654:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:panel show that a 10 percent increase in either mothers’ or fathers’ BMI is correlated with about 
15:353:28752:28:27:72:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:a 1.4 percent increase in child’s BMI.  When both parents’ BMI measures are in the regression 
15:354:28846:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:the individual coefficients decline somewhat – as is to be expected since mothers’ and fathers’ 
15:355:28942:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:BMI are correlated as well – but both are statistically significant.  If children, on average, shared 
15:356:29044:28:27:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:the same amount of common genetics with their mothers and their fathers, but shared more 
15:357:29133:27:28:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:common environment with their mothers we might expect that mothers’ BMI would be more 
15:358:29219:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:important in explaining children’s BMI than fathers’ – as mothers’ BMI would pick up both the 
15:359:29313:27:28:72:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:effect of common genetics and common environment.  These results suggest that the common 
15:360:29402:28:28:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:environment shared by mothers and their children and fathers and their children is similar.  One 
15:361:29499:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:caveat to this is that fathers’ reported BMI is more likely to be missing than mothers. Thus, one 
15:362:29597:27:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:might say that the parent-child correlation in BMI is about the same for fathers and mothers, 
15:363:29691:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:when the father is present.  Since including fathers’ BMI in the regression does not make much 
15:364:29786:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:difference to the estimated mother-child correlation in BMI and we lose observations when we 
15:365:29879:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:require non-missing father BMI data (and those children who are missing fathers’ BMI data are 
15:366:29973:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:more likely to be disadvantaged), we focus on mother-child BMI elasticities in the analyses that 
15:367:30070:28:28:72:109:267:144:Times:144:Times:follow. 
15:368:30078:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times: Looking down the panels in Table 2 we can see how the mother-child BMI elasticity has 
15:369:30164:27:28:72:508:212:144:Times:144:Times:changed over time.  Between the first and second wave of the NHANES, recall, children’s 
15:370:30252:28:27:71:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:obesity rates and BMIs do not change very much.  Here we see that the mother-child BMI 
15:371:30339:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity is nearly identical in these two periods as well, implying that a 10 percent increase in 
15:372:30439:28:28:71:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:mothers’ BMI is correlated with a 1.4 percent increase in children’s BMI.  In the third wave of 
15:373:30535:28:25:72:506:101:144:Times:144:Times:the NHANES, the mother-child elasticity has grown larger. Now, a 10 percent increase in 
15:374:30623:25:7:72:219:76:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
15:375:30681:7:0:72:416:69:42:Times:100:Times:8 Results look similar if the child’s own birth weight is included as a control variable. 
16:376:30773:0:27:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:mothers’ BMI is correlated with a 2.1 percent increase in children’s BMI.  In the fourth wave, 
16:377:30868:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:the mother-child elasticity remains larger than in the earlier periods, with a 10 percent increase in 
16:378:30970:28:27:72:468:653:144:Times:144:Times:mothers’ BMI being correlated with about a 2 percent increase in children’s BMI. 
16:379:31051:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times: We can use the parent-child elasticity to estimate how much of the increase in children’s 
16:380:31141:28:28:72:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:average BMI over time would be predicted, given the mothers’ average increase over the same 
16:381:31233:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:time.  We use the average BMI for mothers and children shown in Appendix Table 1 to calculate 
16:382:31327:27:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:the percentage change in children’s BMI and the percentage change in mothers BMI between the 
16:383:31420:28:27:71:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:first and fourth period.  Using the standard midpoint formula, this would imply that mothers’ 
16:384:31514:27:28:71:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:BMI grew 13.7 percent and the children’s BMI grew 7.3 percent.9  However, even using the 
16:385:31603:28:28:72:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:larger, later period, elasticity, the growth in mothers’ BMI would imply less than a 3 percent 
16:386:31698:28:27:72:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:growth in children’s BMI.10  The growth in mothers’ BMI can explain 37.5 percent of the 
16:387:31786:27:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:increase in children’s BMI between the beginning and the end periods. Clearly, there are other 
16:388:31881:28:27:71:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:factors besides the shared genetic-environmental factors of mothers and children that are driving 
16:389:31979:27:28:72:232:350:144:Times:144:Times:the increase in children’s BMI.    
16:390:32012:28:27:72:237:322:144:Times:144:Times:B. Interpreting the BMI Elasticity 
16:391:32047:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times: As noted above, the parent-child BMI elasticity cannot be used to isolate pure genetic and 
16:392:32138:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:pure environmental determinants of weight status. The observed increase in mother-child BMI 
16:393:32230:28:27:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity is best interpreted as reflecting an increase in the shared environment of mothers and 
16:394:32328:27:28:72:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:their children, or the effect of the interaction of shared genes with the environment.11   Using a 
16:395:32427:28:27:71:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:sample of adult adopted and genetic siblings collected in 2004, Sacerdote (2007) estimates that 
16:396:32523:27:26:71:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:the shared environment explains 30.8 percent of the variance in BMI, genes (and their correlation 
16:397:32621:26:7:72:219:131:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
16:398:32679:7:12:72:507:124:42:Times:100:Times:9 This is obtained by dividing the change between the first and last period by the average of the two periods. 
16:399:32790:12:0:72:521:112:42:Times:100:Times:10 Percentage change in children’s BMI = (elasticity* percentage change in mothers’ BMI) = (0.2*13.7 percent) 
17:400:32902:0:27:72:492:708:144:Times:144:Times:with the environment) explain 11.5 percent, and the rest (57.7 percent) is unexplained.  
17:401:32991:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:Interestingly, this decomposition is very close to the one he calculates for family income, even 
17:402:33088:28:27:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:though this is an outcome that  typically might not be considered to be as genetically determined 
17:403:33186:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:as BMI.  That said, the role of genetics in the mother-child BMI elasticity is made clear when 
17:404:33281:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:comparing estimates using the adopted children to those using the biological children.12  Running 
17:405:33379:28:27:71:519:570:144:Times:144:Times:a regression similar to that shown in column (1) of Table 2 using these data13, one obtains an 
17:406:33474:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity (standard error) for the biological children of 0.221 (0.045), but only 0.025 (0.025) for 
17:407:33575:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:the adoptees.  Thus, the elasticity for biological children for this sample is similar to our later 
17:408:33675:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:elasticities, but it is unlikely to reflect current shared environment.  The implication is that the 
17:409:33776:28:28:72:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:interaction of shared genes and the general, not just the intra-household, environment is likely 
17:410:33873:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:very important.  Thus, suppose that some parents and children are pre-disposed to eat too much 
17:411:33968:27:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:junk food, and vending machines go from being rare in the early period to being ubiquitously 
17:412:34061:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:available in the later period both at work and in schools.  We would observe an increase in BMI 
17:413:34157:27:28:71:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:in both parents and children for the genetically pre-disposed that we would attribute to shared 
17:414:34253:28:27:71:490:322:144:Times:144:Times:genetic-environmental factors. However, it is not necessarily the case that these shared 
17:415:34342:27:28:71:400:295:144:Times:144:Times:environmental factors are solely within the walls of the household.   
17:416:34412:28:28:71:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:   Finally, recall that although BMI has increased for everyone, the BMI for the obese has 
17:417:34503:28:27:71:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:increased more than for the median person, which corresponds to a model of obesity such that 
17:418:34596:27:26:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:there may be some people who are particularly susceptible to weight gain when the environment 
17:419:34690:26:7:72:542:186:100:Times:100:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                           
17:420:34876:7:16:72:525:179:42:Times:100:Times:11 One concern is whether the increase in elasticity is real, or an artifact of changes in measurement error in BMI 
17:421:34992:16:12:72:521:163:100:Times:100:Times:over  time.  We find that changes in measurement error would have to be implausibly large to be the underlying 
17:422:35103:12:7:72:540:151:100:Times:100:Times:driver of the observed increase in parent-child BMI elasticities.  See data appendix for a more detailed explanation.   
17:423:35223:7:16:72:529:144:42:Times:100:Times:12 Recall that these “children” are actually adults – the average age is 28 for the adoptees and 32 for the biological 
17:424:35342:16:7:71:477:128:100:Times:100:Times:children.  Thus, it is unlikely that mother and child are literally sharing an environment at this point.  
17:425:35449:7:0:72:333:121:42:Times:100:Times:13 We thank Bruce Sacerdote for making his data available to us. 
18:426:35516:0:27:72:505:708:144:Times:144:Times:is right, and in the last two decades, the environment has been right.14  Thus the impact of 
18:427:35609:27:28:71:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:common genetic and environmental factors may be different for children who occupy different 
18:428:35701:28:27:71:540:653:144:Times:144:Times:points in the BMI distribution.  Given that we have seen that disadvantaged kids are heavier, it is 
18:429:35801:27:28:71:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:important to investigate whether the mother-child elasticity is constant throughout the BMI 
18:430:35893:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:distribution or not.  Thus, we estimate models identical to column (1) from Table 2, but using 
18:431:35988:28:27:71:526:570:144:Times:144:Times:quantile regression rather than OLS.  We estimate elasticities that fit at each of 20 quantiles of 
18:432:36087:27:28:72:365:543:144:Times:144:Times:the BMI distribution (versus OLS, which fits at the mean).    
18:433:36149:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times: Figures 4-7 plot these quantile regression estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals 
18:434:36238:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:for the mother-child BMI elasticity for NHANES 1-4. First, we see that the elasticity is generally 
18:435:36337:28:28:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:higher at higher quantiles of the BMI distribution, suggesting that for heavier children, the shared 
18:436:36438:28:27:72:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:environmental-genetic component captured by mothers’ BMI is more important in determining 
18:437:36528:27:28:72:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:their BMI.  Second, this relationship seems to have gotten steeper over time.  That is, while the 
18:438:36626:28:27:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity is around 10 percent for the lowest quantiles in all periods, in the earlier periods it does 
18:439:36730:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:not rise much above that level until increasing sharply at about the 80th percentile.  By contrast, 
18:440:36830:28:27:71:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:in the later periods the elasticity rises smoothly throughout the quantiles. 15 The heavier the child, 
18:441:36933:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:the more important the common family genes and environment appear to be in determining her 
18:442:37024:28:28:72:163:267:144:Times:144:Times:weight outcomes.  
18:443:37042:28:27:72:431:239:144:Times:144:Times:C. Differences in Mother-Child Elasticities by Measures of Disadvantage  
18:444:37115:27:28:108:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:Since disadvantaged children are heavier, the results in the preceding section might lead 
18:445:37205:28:26:72:525:184:144:Times:144:Times:one to believe that parent-child elasticities would be higher for disadvantaged groups. Table 3 
18:446:37301:26:7:72:219:158:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
18:447:37359:7:16:72:509:151:42:Times:100:Times:14 Note that how this all works is far from settled science.  Recent evidence suggests that the obese may have 
18:448:37470:16:11:72:522:135:100:Times:100:Times:different body chemistry such that for a given number of calories ingested, their digestive tract can extract more 
18:449:37585:11:7:72:261:124:100:Times:100:Times:calories for use (Weill Medical Center, 2007).  
18:450:37633:7:16:72:520:117:42:Times:100:Times:15 Note, of course, that children at the middle quantiles in NHANES 3 and 4 have BMIs that would have placed 
18:451:37742:16:12:72:539:101:100:Times:100:Times:them farther up the quantile distribution in the earlier year, but since we are using ln(BMI) the shift is not as stark as 
18:452:37865:12:11:72:532:89:100:Times:100:Times:it would be in levels. Thus, across NHANES 2 and 3, median ln(BMI) only increases from 2.77 to 2.78, while 75th 
18:453:37976:11:0:72:264:78:100:Times:100:Times:percentile ln(BMI) increases from 2.85 to 2.88. 
19:454:38026:0:27:72:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:investigates whether the mother-child elasticity, which has increased on average, has changed in 
19:455:38123:27:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:similar ways for advantaged and disadvantaged groups.    The regressions control for a cubic in 
19:456:38219:28:27:72:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:age fully interacted with gender, and all measures of disadvantage.  Interactions between 
19:457:38309:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:mother’s log BMI and specific measures of disadvantage are entered separately. The top panel 
19:458:38401:28:28:72:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:shows the interaction of log of mothers’ BMI with race/ethnicity; the second panel shows the 
19:459:38494:28:27:72:505:570:144:Times:144:Times:interaction with the reference person’s highest grade completed; the third panel shows the 
19:460:38585:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:interaction with the income-to-poverty-line ratio.  The results for the different waves of the 
19:461:38680:28:27:71:289:515:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES are reported in the four columns.   
19:462:38723:27:28:71:498:488:144:Times:144:Times: Looking down the panels we see, in general, that there is little consistent role for 
19:463:38808:28:28:71:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage in terms of its effect on the mother-child elasticity.16  In the first panel, the majority 
19:464:38912:28:27:72:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:of the point estimates imply that the mother-child elasticity for blacks and for Hispanics is 
19:465:39006:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:smaller than for white non-Hispanics, but the estimates are not significantly different from zero 
19:466:39104:28:27:72:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:and are not consistently negative in all periods.  In the second panel, using the household 
19:467:39196:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:reference person’s education as a measure of disadvantage, there is again no real impact on the 
19:468:39292:28:27:72:493:322:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity.  In the final panel, when we use perhaps the most straightforward measure of 
19:469:39381:27:28:72:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage - the income-to-poverty-line ratio - the majority of the point estimates imply a 
19:470:39475:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:lower elasticity for the disadvantaged, but again the difference is not significantly different from 
19:471:39576:28:27:72:99:239:144:Times:144:Times:zero. 
19:472:39582:27:28:72:509:212:144:Times:144:Times: Nonetheless, Table 4 uses the point estimates from Table 3 to calculate the implied 
19:473:39666:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:mother-child BMI elasticity for different groups.  Doing this calculation makes clear that this 
19:474:39762:27:28:72:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity has increased over time for most groups, but indicates that it may have decreased 
19:475:39855:28:28:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:slightly (albeit not significantly) for the more advantaged groups in the last period.  Recall from 
19:476:39955:28:0:72:530:101:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 that the effect of disadvantage on children’s BMI was positive and growing over time.  
20:477:40052:0:27:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:That is, that the disadvantaged were increasingly heavier than the non-disadvantaged.   However, 
20:478:40149:27:28:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:it does not appear that this increasing effect of disadvantage can be attributed to differences in 
20:479:40248:28:27:72:443:653:144:Times:144:Times:the shared genetic-environmental factors of these mothers and their children. 
20:480:40326:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times: These results are somewhat puzzling when contrasted with the quantile regression results 
20:481:40415:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:in the previous section.  We expected that since heavier children show higher parent-child BMI 
20:482:40510:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:elasticities, and disadvantaged children tend to be heavier, that we would find higher parent child 
20:483:40610:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:elasticities for the disadvantaged.  However, the quantile regression results suggest that common 
20:484:40708:28:27:71:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:genetic-environment factors play a larger role for heavier children, and that this difference is 
20:485:40805:27:28:71:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:better captured by one’s place in the log BMI distribution itself than by coarse measures of 
20:486:40898:28:28:71:470:460:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage that are simply correlated with one’s place in the BMI distribution.

20:488:40983:27:28:72:334:405:144:Times:144:Times:VI. Common Parent-Child Environmental Factors 
20:489:41029:28:27:108:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:The above analysis suggests that, overall, common-parent child factors are becoming 
20:490:41113:27:28:71:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:increasingly important in determining weight outcomes. Ideally, we would like to be able to 
20:491:41205:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:observe the factors that determine BMI – caloric in-take and expenditure – and correlate these 
20:492:41300:27:28:71:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:underlying factors for both adults and children.  We would like to be able to do this for different 
20:493:41400:28:28:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:measures of disadvantage in order to see whether it is differences in food consumed or exercise 
20:494:41496:28:27:71:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:that determines differences in BMI across disadvantaged groups.  Further, we would ideally be 
20:495:41590:27:28:71:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:able to observe the environments in which the advantaged and disadvantaged live and examine 
20:496:41682:28:27:71:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:whether these differences affect caloric in-take or expenditure.  In this section, we present some 
20:497:41781:27:28:71:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:evidence on these environmental factors, while also discussing the many challenges in 
20:498:41867:28:28:71:295:129:144:Times:144:Times:examining these direct determinants of BMI.   
20:499:41913:28:25:71:245:101:144:Times:144:Times:A. Caloric In-take by Disadvantage 
20:500:41948:25:7:72:542:76:100:Times:100:Times:                                                                                                                                                                                           
20:501:42134:7:0:72:426:69:42:Times:100:Times:16 There continues to be no significant interaction effect when using quantile regression. 
21:502:42227:0:27:72:527:708:144:Times:144:Times: Since we know that BMI is higher for disadvantaged groups, it seems likely we should 
21:503:42312:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:find that caloric in-take is higher for these groups or energy expended is lower.  However, it is 
21:504:42410:28:27:72:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:very difficult to find evidence of these differences.  First, over time, relatively small caloric 
21:505:42508:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:imbalances can result in a relatively large amount of weight gain.  In fact, Cutler, Glaeser and 
21:506:42605:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:Shapiro (2003) estimate that the weight gain observed for the median adult male between the 
21:507:42697:28:27:72:498:570:144:Times:144:Times:early 1970s and the early 2000s can be entirely accounted for by just a daily 150-calorie 
21:508:42787:27:28:71:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:imbalance.  Thus, just one extra 12 ounce can of non-diet soda per day is sufficient to cause the 
21:509:42885:28:27:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:increase in the median man’s weight gain seen in recent years.  Even fewer excess calories can 
21:510:42980:27:28:72:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:explain the increase in obesity for children (Schanzenbach, 2005).  Second, good data on caloric 
21:511:43077:28:28:72:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:intake and expenditure are difficult to obtain.  While food diary data (as is available in the 
21:512:43172:28:27:72:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES), is generally considered fairly reliable, the caloric intake is still likely measured with 
21:513:43271:27:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:error.  Caloric expenditure data tends to be more problematic, since accurately describing the 
21:514:43366:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:intensity of exercise can be difficult.  As a result, analyses of caloric imbalance will likely have 
21:515:43467:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:difficulty precisely estimating differences in calorie intake that are as small as those required to 
21:516:43568:28:27:72:292:322:144:Times:144:Times:explain a great deal of weight gain over time. 
21:517:43615:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times: Nonetheless, we will use the food diary data from the NHANES to try to get a feel for 
21:518:43701:28:28:72:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:eating patterns over time and by disadvantage status.  We will investigate caloric intake overall, 
21:519:43800:28:27:72:502:239:144:Times:144:Times:and from a set of food types that may be markers of better or worse nutritional habits.  In 
21:520:43892:27:28:72:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:particular, we focus mainly on food away from home, fast food and fruits and vegetables.  
21:521:43982:28:27:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:Table 5 presents a regression of log(calories+1) for each of these food types on the income-to-
21:522:44077:27:28:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:poverty ratio along with a cubic in age fully interacted with gender.17  Thus, these models are 
21:523:44173:28:26:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:identical to those shown in the third panel of Table 1, but using calories instead of BMI in the 
21:524:44270:26:7:72:219:103:100:Times:100:Times:                                                           
21:525:44328:7:16:72:529:96:42:Times:100:Times:17 We add one to all of the calorie counts so as not to have to drop observations with no consumption in a specific 
21:526:44444:16:0:72:294:80:100:Times:100:Times:food group.  See the Data Appendix for further details. 
22:527:44502:0:27:72:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:dependent variable.  The regressions using total calories show an inconsistent pattern in the 
22:528:44596:27:28:72:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:correlation between the income-to-poverty line ratio and total calories. In the first wave, the 
22:529:44692:28:27:72:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:relationship is positive, but insignificant. In the second wave, it is positive and significant – 
22:530:44790:27:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:meaning that children from wealthier families report consuming more calories.  In the third wave 
22:531:44887:28:28:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:it is negative and insignificant; in the fourth, it is very small and insignificant.  Thus, if anything, 
22:532:44992:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:we observe a change between NHANES 2 and 3 in which disadvantage no longer implies fewer 
22:533:45081:27:28:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:calories, but rather more calories, but that in more recent years, all children have similar caloric 
22:534:45182:28:27:72:113:515:144:Times:144:Times:intake.   
22:535:45192:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times: While total calories (if well-measured) are what ought to matter for weight gain or loss, 
22:536:45282:28:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:we also examine calorie in-take from fruits and vegetables and calories consumed away from 
22:537:45373:28:27:72:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:home. Consumption of fruits and vegetables may be viewed as a “marker” of healthful eating 
22:538:45464:27:28:72:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:habits, and thus may give us some insight into how disadvantage may correlate with poor 
22:539:45552:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:nutrition. Similarly, we examine calories from food consumed away from home.  One popular 
22:540:45642:27:28:72:491:350:144:Times:144:Times:explanation for the rise in obesity is that consumption of food from fast food and other 
22:541:45731:28:27:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:restaurants has increased.  The notion is that with professionally prepared food individuals are 
22:542:45828:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:less aware of the calorie content of what they are eating, have less control over portion size, and 
22:543:45928:28:28:72:504:267:144:Times:144:Times:may find the food more palatable, than food prepared at home.  Note that French fries are 
22:544:46018:28:27:72:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:included in this measure of fruits and vegetables – for some of the years we can separate out 
22:545:46112:27:28:72:492:212:144:Times:144:Times:certain food types and food venders and we will do that when we examine parent-child 
22:546:46197:28:27:72:253:184:144:Times:144:Times:correlations in calorie consumption.   
22:547:46236:27:28:72:490:157:144:Times:144:Times: For now, note that the second column of Table 5 indicates that in the first three 
22:548:46318:28:28:72:492:129:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES, higher income is associated with significantly more calories from fruits and 
22:549:46403:28:0:72:518:101:144:Times:144:Times:vegetables.  In the last two NHANES, higher incomes are associated with significantly more 
23:550:46496:0:27:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:calories consumed away from home.  Thus, there is some evidence that advantaged and 
23:551:46580:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged children consume calories from different sources, and that these relationships may 
23:552:46677:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:have changed over time. However, with these broad measures of caloric in-take it is hard to see 
23:553:46773:27:28:72:302:626:144:Times:144:Times:how this may translate into differences in BMI. 
23:554:46821:28:28:72:244:598:144:Times:144:Times:B. Mother-Child Calorie Elasticies 
23:555:46856:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times: Having seen that the intra-household correlation in BMI has increased over time, but with 
23:556:46946:27:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:no real pattern by disadvantaged, we now turn to looking more closely at intra-household 
23:557:47035:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:correlations in eating patterns.  With NHANES 3 and 4, we have enough data to look at children 
23:558:47130:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:matched to an adult household member.  The matched data looks very similar to the total data 
23:559:47223:28:28:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:that are both available for NHANES 3.  Appendix Table 2 repeats the relevant panel of Table 5, 
23:560:47318:28:27:72:531:432:144:Times:144:Times:and then replicates it using the matched data.  Additionally, the more detailed food codes allow 
23:561:47415:27:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:us to remove French fries and potato chips from the fruit and vegetable category, and to identify 
23:562:47513:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:fast food consumption.  The final columns, then, reflect these two additional food groups.  Note 
23:563:47610:27:28:72:479:350:144:Times:144:Times:that without French fries and chips, the effect of disadvantage on fruit and vegetable 
23:564:47697:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:consumption becomes more important.  Similarly, while the more advantaged do eat more fast 
23:565:47788:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:food, the effect is much smaller than for the broader food-away-from-home category, and is not 
23:566:47883:28:28:72:238:267:144:Times:144:Times:significantly different from zero.   
23:567:47920:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times: Having seen that the matched data is similar to the full data, we now use NHANES 3 and 
23:568:48007:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:4 data to estimate intra-household calorie elasticities in a manner identical to those calculated for 
23:569:48109:28:27:72:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:BMI in Table 2. For each of the five food groups (i.e. total calories, fruit and vegetable calories, 
23:570:48210:27:28:72:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:calories away from home, fruit and vegetable calories without fries and chips, and fast food 
23:571:48303:28:28:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:calories), we regress the child’s log(calories+1) on first the mother’s log(calories+1), then the 
23:572:48401:28:0:72:539:101:144:Times:144:Times:father’s log (calories+1), and then both.  The results are in Table 6.  For total calories, the results 
24:573:48507:0:27:72:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:show patterns that are similar to the BMI estimates.  That is, both the mother and the father 
24:574:48601:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:matter; estimates are similar whether the parents are included together or separately; and there is 
24:575:48701:28:27:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:no significant difference between mother and father.  Additionally, unlike for the BMI elasticity, 
24:576:48800:27:28:72:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:the point estimate of the calorie elasticity increases somewhat between the two later periods. 
24:577:48895:28:28:108:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:For the specific food groups, the mother elasticity is always larger, and is sometimes 
24:578:48982:28:27:72:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:significantly different from the father elasticity when included together.  In the earlier period, 
24:579:49081:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:while mother is not significantly different from father for all fruits and vegetables, once we 
24:580:49176:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:remove French fries and chips there is a marginally statistically significant difference.   When 
24:581:49273:27:28:72:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:looking specifically at fast food, the maternal elasticity of 0.319 is twice the size of the paternal 
24:582:49375:28:28:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity of 0.151.  This finding is consistent with a story where fathers have opportunities to eat 
24:583:49477:28:27:72:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:fast food that do not include their children -- for example, lunch on a work day.   In the second 
24:584:49575:27:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:period, however, only the elasticity of calories from fast food shows a statistically significant 
24:585:49673:28:27:72:282:377:144:Times:144:Times:difference between the mother and father.   
24:586:49717:27:28:108:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:Some interesting patterns emerge when comparing the food subgroup results across 
24:587:49798:28:27:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:periods.  For the main markers of poor diet – food away from home and fast food, the calorie 
24:588:49891:27:28:72:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity increases over time, while for both measures of fruits and vegetables, the calorie 
24:589:49985:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity decreases, as does the total calorie elasticity.  This pattern holds for both the mothers 
24:590:50086:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:and the fathers.   Recall that the data with which we can calculate parent-child calorie elasticities 
24:591:50188:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:come from only the last two NHANES.  In these data, the parent-child BMI elasticity was higher 
24:592:50283:28:27:72:510:184:144:Times:144:Times:than in the earlier two periods, but about the same between these two years.  Thus, it is not 
24:593:50377:27:28:72:525:157:144:Times:144:Times:necessarily a conflict that we do not see an increase in, for example, the total calorie elasticity 
24:594:50477:28:0:72:207:129:144:Times:144:Times:between these two years.     
25:595:50508:0:27:108:507:708:144:Times:144:Times:While it appears that both mother’s and father’s eating patterns influence children, 
25:596:50593:27:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:mothers seem to play the dominant role.  Thus, as was the case with the BMI elasticities, we will 
25:597:50691:28:27:72:459:653:144:Times:144:Times:just focus on the maternal elasticity when investigating the role of disadvantage. 
25:598:50774:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times: Table 7 is parallel to the bottom panel of Table 3, in that it uses the income-to-poverty 
25:599:50864:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:ratio as the measure of disadvantage, and interacts it with the maternal log(calorie+1) measure.  
25:600:50962:28:27:72:501:570:144:Times:144:Times:Here, each column is a different food group.  Looking first at column (1), we see that the 
25:601:51053:27:28:72:501:543:144:Times:144:Times:elasticity of total calories is larger for the more disadvantaged, but this difference is only 
25:602:51148:28:27:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:marginally statistically significant in the last period. This point estimate may be due to the fact 
25:603:51248:27:28:72:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:that by this time period advantaged mothers are more likely to work (and work longer hours) 
25:604:51340:28:28:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:than disadvantaged mothers (Anderson et. al., 2003).  Advantaged mothers may thus be spending 
25:605:51434:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:more time away from their children than disadvantaged mothers, leading to a lower elasticity in 
25:606:51530:27:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:calories consumed.  Overall, though, as was the case with Table 3, there little evidence of a 
25:607:51624:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant difference in the mother-child calorie elasticity for the disadvantaged.  
25:608:51724:27:28:72:232:350:144:Times:144:Times:C. Other Environmental Factors 
25:609:51755:28:27:72:492:322:144:Times:144:Times: Above we examined reported caloric in-take patterns for insight into the shared 
25:610:51835:27:28:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:environment between mothers and their children that might affect their BMI.  This intake is 
25:611:51927:28:28:72:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:clearly a small subset of the complex environmental factors that affect body mass, however.  One 
25:612:52024:28:27:72:492:239:144:Times:144:Times:would clearly like information on calories expended as well as calories consumed. The 
25:613:52110:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:measurement problems that attend collecting information on calories consumed are increased for 
25:614:52205:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:calories expended – not only does one need information on the number of minutes spent running, 
25:615:52300:27:28:71:525:157:144:Times:144:Times:for example, but the intensity of that activity.  Carefully controlled medical studies are able to 
25:616:52399:28:0:71:531:129:144:Times:144:Times:document how calories expended and consumed affect BMI, however these necessarily give us 
26:617:52491:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:little insight into who chooses to participate in different caloric in-take and expenditure behavior 
26:618:52592:27:28:71:297:681:144:Times:144:Times:and why they make those different decisions.   
26:619:52639:28:27:71:536:653:144:Times:144:Times: In order to explain differences in body mass between the advantaged and disadvantaged, 
26:620:52726:27:28:71:482:626:144:Times:144:Times:many social science researchers have turned to documenting differences in the living 
26:621:52811:28:28:71:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:environment that each group faces.  We examined county business pattern data for 1980-1986  
26:622:52903:28:27:71:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:and 1988-1994 (years which roughly correspond to the second and third waves of the NHANES 
26:623:52993:27:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:data – the period when we see an initial jump in children’s obesity rates) in order to see whether 
26:624:53092:28:27:71:490:515:144:Times:144:Times:the environments in which the disadvantaged live have changed differentially from the 
26:625:53178:27:28:72:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:environments in which the advantaged live in ways that are likely to affect body mass.  The 
26:626:53270:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:results showed no consistent pattern between changes in the availability of restaurants, grocery 
26:627:53367:28:27:72:389:432:144:Times:144:Times:stores or recreation outlets and various measures of disadvantage. 
26:628:53434:27:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times: There are several problems with this approach. First, the establishment definitions are 
26:629:53522:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:coarse, for example many types of restaurants are grouped together.  Growth in the count of 
26:630:53614:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:restaurants in an advantaged area may represent growth in establishments that cater to a health 
26:631:53710:28:27:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:conscious crowd, while in a disadvantaged area it may represent growth in fast food restaurants.  
26:632:53808:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that we found no consistent pattern in changes in establishment 
26:633:53907:28:28:72:361:267:144:Times:144:Times:types over time by county level measures of disadvantage.   
26:634:53967:28:27:72:520:239:144:Times:144:Times: A second problem is more fundamental, and would be a problem even if we had very 
26:635:54048:27:28:72:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:detailed and accurate measures of establishment type linked to specific geographic areas.  
26:636:54139:28:27:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:Ideally, we would like to examine whether an exogenous increase in concentration of fast food 
26:637:54233:27:28:71:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:restaurants, for example, increases caloric in-take and increases body mass. Similarly, we would 
26:638:54330:28:28:72:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:like to know whether an exogenous increase in recreational space, for example, increases 
26:639:54419:28:0:72:527:101:144:Times:144:Times:exercise, and reduces weight.  Without that exogenous variation, it is very hard to say whether 
27:640:54517:0:27:72:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:fast food restaurants cause people to eat unhealthful foods, or whether restaurant owners simply 
27:641:54614:27:28:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:open franchises near where they perceive their customers to live – e.g., obese individuals would 
27:642:54711:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:likely consume fast food whether or not there is one around the corner, but franchise owners, in 
27:643:54808:27:28:72:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:an attempt to get customers into their particular store, may try to locate very close to the 
27:644:54901:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:customers.  Given the importance for policy purposes of understanding whether location of fast 
27:645:54996:28:27:71:502:570:144:Times:144:Times:food restaurants, for example, has a causal impact on obesity, research with a design that 
27:646:55087:27:28:71:311:543:144:Times:144:Times:credibly answers this question is a high priority.

27:648:55140:27:28:71:158:488:144:Times:144:Times:VII. Conclusion  
27:649:55157:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:  Designing good policies to affect childhood obesity will require an understanding of how 
27:650:55248:28:27:71:507:432:144:Times:144:Times:the environment that children face is related to their body mass.  Although our attempts to 
27:651:55340:27:28:71:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:directly measure changes in the food and exercise environments faced by advantaged and 
27:652:55427:28:27:71:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged children were not very fruitful, our earlier results on child-parent BMI elasticity 
27:653:55525:27:28:71:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:indirectly suggest that shared environment/genetics do play an important role.  In fact, we find 
27:654:55622:28:27:71:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:that the shared mother-child component of BMI became increasingly important over this time 
27:655:55713:27:28:71:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:period, reflected in the increase in the mother-child BMI elasticity.   However, if the only 
27:656:55806:28:28:71:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:determinants of children’s body mass were their genes and the environment they share with their 
27:657:55902:28:27:71:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:parents, we would expect to find that increases in parents’ BMI can go a long way toward 
27:658:55991:27:28:71:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:explaining the increases we have seen in children’s BMI over the last few decades.  Instead, on 
27:659:56087:28:27:71:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:average, based on our estimates of the mother-child BMI elasticity, the 13.7 percent increase in 
27:660:56184:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:mothers’ average BMI over the 30-year period we examine can explain at most 40 percent of the 
27:661:56278:28:0:72:309:129:144:Times:144:Times:7.3 percent increase in children’s average BMI.   
28:662:56330:0:27:108:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:The title of this paper asks whether in determining children’s obesity, “nurture” is 
28:663:56415:27:28:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:trumping “nature” and whether that is different for disadvantaged children.  While we find that 
28:664:56511:28:27:72:519:653:144:Times:144:Times:common parent-child factors are becoming more important in determining children’s weight 
28:665:56600:27:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes, this result is consistent with both an increasing role for “nurture” and an increasing 
28:666:56697:28:28:72:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:role for “nature.” For example, there is either an increasing role for the shared environments that 
28:667:56797:28:27:72:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:affect both parents’ and children’s body mass, or an increasing role of the overall environment 
28:668:56893:27:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:for certain genetic profiles (which may be shared by parents and their children).  The former 
28:669:56987:28:27:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:situation might fit what we loosely mean by “nurture” – parental choices that  involve such 
28:670:57079:27:28:72:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:things as increasingly sharing meals and snacks made up of unhealthful foods or sharing more 
28:671:57172:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:sedentary, rather than vigorous, activities.  The latter situation might fit what we loosely think of 
28:672:57274:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:as “nature”-- or at least how one’s natural susceptibility towards obesity interacts with one’s 
28:673:57370:27:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:environment --  and might include eating increasingly available unhealthful foods in separate 
28:674:57464:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:environments (say at school for children, at work for parents) that have similar effects on those 
28:675:57562:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:with the same genetic susceptibility to weight gain.  Note that Anderson and Butcher (2006b) 
28:676:57655:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:finds evidence for a different effect of “environment” on those with a genetic susceptibility 
28:677:57749:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:toward weight gain since that study finds that the availability of junk food in schools results in 
28:678:57848:28:28:72:435:267:144:Times:144:Times:higher weights only for those adolescents who have an overweight parent.   
28:679:57923:28:27:72:487:239:144:Times:144:Times: Overall, it appears that the parent-child elasticity is similar for advantaged and 
28:680:58006:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantaged children, for both it has increased over time,  but, as noted above, that changes in 
28:681:58105:28:27:72:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:parents’ BMI  still does not explain most of the change in children’s BMI.  Regardless of 
28:682:58195:27:28:72:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:whether one wants to interpret the finding that the elasticity has increased as evidence for 
28:683:58288:28:28:72:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:increasing importance of parental choices for children (“nurture”) or the increasing importance 
28:684:58384:28:0:72:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:of the environment for both children and parents who share a similar genetic susceptibility to 
29:685:58481:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:weight gain (“nature” interacting with the environment), there appear to be different factors that 
29:686:58580:27:28:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:affect parents’ and children’s body-mass. Child-specific environments like schools, childcare 
29:687:58674:28:27:72:494:653:144:Times:144:Times:facilities, and playgrounds may play an important role in determining children’s weight 
29:688:58762:27:28:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes.  This is an important implication since it suggests policies targeted at changing 
29:689:58854:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:children’s environment outside the family, rather than solely targeting parental choices, may be 
29:690:58951:28:0:72:303:570:144:Times:144:Times:an effective way to address childhood obesity.

32:746:61874:27:28:71:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:Survey (NHANES).  Most of these data are publicly available from the National Center for

32:748:62055:28:27:71:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).  We use four waves of this survey.  The first, known as 
32:749:62149:27:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES 1 was collected between 1971 and 1975, the second, NHANES 2, was collected 
32:750:62231:28:27:72:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:between 1976 and 1980 while the third, NHANES 3, was collected between 1988 and 1994.

32:755:62703:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:resident parents, along with basic demographics such as age, gender and race/ethnicity.  For an 
32:756:62799:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:adult household reference person, we also have completed education in years, and for the family 
32:757:62895:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:as a group we have the ratio of family income to the poverty line for a family of that size in that

32:759:63001:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times: Also publicly available for the children is information from a 24-hour recall food diary.  
32:760:63092:28:27:72:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:Each food item consumed is separately recorded, giving the food category, along with key 
32:761:63181:27:28:72:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:nutritional information such as calories.  The exact food codes used differ slightly over the 
32:762:63275:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:waves, but we can always identify whether the food item was consumed at home or away, and 
32:763:63365:27:28:72:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:the major food group (e.g. fruits and vegetables; dairy products, etc.).  For consistency across 
32:764:63462:28:28:72:508:129:144:Times:144:Times:waves, we choose to look at total calories, calories from the major category, “all fruits and 
32:765:63556:28:0:72:525:101:144:Times:144:Times:vegetables” and calories consumed away from home.  For each individual, then, we aggregate 
33:766:63649:0:27:72:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:the calories from food items in those categories to obtain a per-person measure of total calories 
33:767:63747:27:28:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:consumed, calories consumed from fruits and vegetables, and calories consumed away from 
33:768:63835:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:home.  We then add one to each of these aggregates.  While one calorie is fairly incidental in an 
33:769:63933:27:28:72:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:individual’s diet, this addition allows us to take logs of our calories subgroups, even if an 
33:770:64027:28:28:72:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:individual did not eat any calories from that group in the 24 hours captured by the diary.   
33:771:64120:28:27:72:527:570:144:Times:144:Times: The fourth wave is slightly different from the first three.  First, what we will refer to as 
33:772:64213:27:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:NHANES 4 is actually made up of 3 separate sub-waves named NHANES 1999-2000, NHANES 
33:773:64297:28:27:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:2001-2002 and NHANES 2003-2004.  These data can pooled and appropriate six-year sample 
33:774:64384:27:28:72:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:weights computed such that the data are also representative of the U.S. population at the 
33:775:64474:28:28:72:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:midpoint of the survey years.  As with the other waves, we extract publicly available data on 
33:776:64568:28:27:72:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:professionally measured BMI for children age 2 to 11, along with basic demographics such as 
33:777:64660:27:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:age, gender and race/ethnicity.  Also available for each child is the income-to-poverty line ratio 
33:778:64759:28:27:72:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:for the child’s family.  Unfortunately, the reported parental BMI is not available in these data.  
33:779:64858:27:28:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:As a result, we must create a “matched” data set using a confidential household identifier to 
33:780:64952:28:27:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:compute intra-household BMI elasticities.  Since NHANES 3 is also large enough to create a 
33:781:65043:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:similar matched data set (using the publicly available household identifier), we can evaluate the 
33:782:65141:28:28:72:257:267:144:Times:144:Times:importance of this alternate approach. 
33:783:65180:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times: Based on results from NHANES 3, which determined that 89 percent of households had 
33:784:65263:27:28:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:only one adult (age 20-50) male and 88 percent had only one adult female, we settled on a very 
33:785:65358:28:27:72:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:simple matching algorithm.  For each household, the adult females age 20-50, adult males age 
33:786:65451:27:28:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:20-50 and children age 2-11 were separated out and sorted by age.  The first adult female in the 
33:787:65548:28:28:72:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:household was then assigned to be the child’s “mother” and the first adult male was assigned to 
33:788:65644:28:0:72:537:101:144:Times:144:Times:be the “father.”  Based on the reported parental information in NHANES 3, it appeared that only 
34:789:65742:0:27:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:4 percent of the matched mothers had a BMI and age that were inappropriate.  As a result models 
34:790:65838:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:identical to those in Tables 2 and 3 run using the matched NHANES 3 data looked very much 
34:791:65928:28:27:72:431:653:144:Times:144:Times:like those presented using the larger data set with reported parental BMI.   
34:792:66005:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times: Unfortunately, with NHANES 4, we cannot make this same comparison, but again given 
34:793:66088:28:28:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:the large number of households with only one adult female or adult male, we feel confident that 
34:794:66184:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:the results are reliable.  A few other differences in NHANES 4 are potentially problematic.  First, 
34:795:66284:27:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:education was not reported for the household reference person.  Thus, we must use the matched 
34:796:66378:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:“mother” and “father” to determine the reference person’s education.  When we have education 
34:797:66471:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:for a “father” in the household, we choose that as the reference person’s education.  Otherwise, 
34:798:66568:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:we use the “mother” in the household.  Second, in NHANES 4, education is not recorded as 
34:799:66657:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:years completed, but rather is categorical – less than high school, high school graduate, beyond 
34:800:66754:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:high school.  To maintain consistency with the previous waves, we code these categories as 10 
34:801:66848:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:years of education, 12 years, and 14 years, respectively.  The results from this approximation to 
34:802:66946:27:28:72:496:350:144:Times:144:Times:continuous years of education do not differ substantively from including the categorical 
34:803:67035:28:27:72:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:dummies.  Appendix Table 1 presents summary statistics for the variables used in our main 
34:804:67125:27:28:72:289:295:144:Times:144:Times:analyses for all four waves of the NHANES. 
34:805:67168:28:28:72:514:267:144:Times:144:Times: As noted above, the 24-hour food recall diaries (used in our secondary analyses) are 
34:806:67253:28:27:72:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:available for everyone, making it possible to examine the effect of disadvantage on eating 
34:807:67344:27:28:72:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:patterns for all waves of the NHANES.  However, within-household correlations can only be 
34:808:67434:28:27:72:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:computed when children are matched to adults in the household.  While we can follow the 
34:809:67522:27:28:72:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:matching procedures outlined above for NHANES 1 and 2, the resulting sample sizes are too 
34:810:67612:28:28:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:small to provide useful estimates.  Thus, we limit our in-depth analysis of intra-household eating 
34:811:67711:28:0:72:245:101:144:Times:144:Times:behaviors to the NHANES 3 and 4. 
35:812:67746:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times: Across these two waves, we try to maintain as much consistency in the definition of food 
35:813:67835:27:28:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:groups as possible.  One area where this is not entirely possible is in the definition of fast food 
35:814:67935:28:27:72:517:653:144:Times:144:Times:calories.  In NHANES 3, calories are coded based on the item being described using a set of 
35:815:68027:27:28:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:detailed codes for branded products (e.g. Burger King Whopper, Wendy’s Frosty, etc.   Thus, 
35:816:68118:28:28:71:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:“fast food calories” implies having consumed any kind of food from a fast food restaurant, no 
35:817:68212:28:27:71:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:matter where it was consumed.  .In NHANES 1999-2000, we can identify that a food item was 
35:818:68302:27:28:71:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:eaten at a fast food establishment, but if it was brought home and eaten, it will not be coded as 
35:819:68400:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:“fast food.”  In NHANES 2003-2004, we can identify that a food item was obtained from a fast 
35:820:68493:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:food restaurant, no matter where it was consumed, while in NHANES 2001-2002 we cannot 
35:821:68579:28:28:72:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:identify fast food at all.  As a result, for NHANES 4, “fast food calories” implies calories from 
35:822:68677:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:food items that were either eaten at a fast food restaurant in the early years or obtained from a 
35:823:68775:27:28:72:253:405:144:Times:144:Times:fast food restaurant in the later years. 
35:824:68816:28:27:72:465:377:144:Times:144:Times:B. Implications for Estimated Elasticity of Changing Measurement Error in BMI  
35:825:68894:27:28:108:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:While it appears that between the 1971-1980 and 1988-2004 periods there was a marked 
35:826:68979:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:increase in the parent-child BMI elasticity, a concern with this conclusion may be that, in fact, 
35:827:69077:27:28:72:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:the true elasticity has not changed, but rather the amount of measurement error in BMI has 
35:828:69168:28:28:72:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:fallen, allowing us to estimate this true elasticity more precisely (e.g. the signal-to-noise ratio has 
35:829:69272:28:27:72:509:239:144:Times:144:Times:risen).  If one makes the assumption of a constant true elasticity, one can use the estimated 
35:830:69366:27:28:72:503:212:144:Times:144:Times:elasticities, along with the variance in log mothers’ BMI to estimate what combination of 
35:831:69456:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:constant elasticity and error variance would be consistent with these estimated elasticities.  The 
35:832:69555:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:result is an implausibly large error variance of 0.030 combined with a constant elasticity of 0.52.  
35:833:69656:28:28:71:513:129:144:Times:144:Times:Note that in NHANES 3, since we have both reported and measured maternal BMI, we can 
35:834:69741:28:0:71:504:101:144:Times:144:Times:calculate an alternate measure of the error variance (and thus of the true elasticity) from a 
36:835:69837:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:regression of the measured BMI on the reported BMI.  This exercise implies a true elasticity of 
36:836:69933:27:28:72:509:681:144:Times:144:Times:0.23, with an error variance of just 0.004 in NHANES 3.  Thus, we conclude that it is very 
36:837:70024:28:27:72:533:653:144:Times:144:Times:unlikely that a simple measurement error story is behind the increase in the estimated elasticity, 
36:838:70123:27:28:72:377:626:144:Times:144:Times:and that there has indeed been an increase in the true elasticity.
