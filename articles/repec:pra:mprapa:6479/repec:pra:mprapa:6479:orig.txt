2:20:691:15:14:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tion and labor income (wage) taxes.  We construct an environment in which individuals
2:21:776:14:15:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:make real labor-leisure choices and spend their earned income on real goods. We use this
2:22:864:15:14:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:experimental framework to test whether a labor income tax and an equivalent consumption
2:23:951:14:15:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tax lead to an identical labor-leisure allocation. Despite controlling for subjects’ work abil-
2:24:1046:15:14:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ity and inherent labor-leisure preferences and not allowing for saving, subjects reduce their
2:25:1139:14:15:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:labor supply significantly more in response to an income tax than they do in response to an
2:26:1230:15:14:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:equivalent consumption tax. We discuss the economic implications of a policy shift from an
2:27:1320:14:36:72:225:365:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:income to a consumption tax.

3:39:2205:0:36:72:208:739:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:1  Introduction
3:40:2220:36:23:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Since Hobbes (1651) and continuing with Mill (1871), the question of whether to tax con-
3:41:2308:23:23:72:540:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:sumption or income has occupied a central place in tax policy debate. In January 2005,
3:42:2394:23:24:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:President George W. Bush commissioned a panel to provide recommendations that would
3:43:2477:24:23:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:simplify the existing federal tax code and render it more equitable, efficient and conducive
3:44:2569:23:24:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to economic growth (President’s Advisory Panel on Tax Reform 2005). The panel consid-
3:45:2654:24:23:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ered numerous national sales tax plans to replace the entire income tax system as well as
3:46:2743:23:23:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a detailed value added tax program to allow for a reduction in individual and corporate
3:47:2830:23:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:income tax rates.  The complexity of replacing the current tax code with a broad-based
3:48:2916:24:23:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consumption tax system inhibited the panel from reaching a consensus. Notwithstanding,
3:49:3002:23:24:72:338:493:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:such a shift remains high on the tax reform agenda.
3:50:3053:24:23:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The classic Haig-Simons definition (according to which income equals consumption plus
3:51:3138:23:23:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:changes in wealth (savings)) highlights that the major distinction between an income tax (on
3:52:3230:23:24:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:all income sources) and a consumption tax is the former’s taxation of savings. The taxation
3:53:3321:24:23:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of savings distorts the taxpayer’s intertemporal consumption allocation, an often-invoked
3:54:3410:23:24:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:argument in favor of shifting to a consumption tax. In a second-best setting, redistributive
3:55:3502:24:23:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:goals may justify the taxation of savings despite its distortive effects. A long public finance
3:56:3597:23:24:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:literature beginning with Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) (AS) addresses the desirability of using
3:57:3692:24:23:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:commodity taxation for redistributive purposes as a supplement to an optimal labor income
3:58:3781:23:23:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(wage) tax. Using Mirrlees’ (1971) standard setting, AS show that when preferences over
3:59:3868:23:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the set of consumption goods are separable from leisure, the optimal commodity tax must
3:60:3955:24:23:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:be uniform; namely, all consumption goods are subject to the same tax rate. An implication
3:61:4045:23:24:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of this pioneering result is that future and present consumption should be taxed at the
3:62:4132:24:0:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:same rate. In other words, the taxation of savings is undesirable. AS and the subsequent
4:63:4221:0:24:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:literature1are premised on the equivalence between a wage tax and a consumption tax.2In
4:64:4308:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:fact, wage taxes can be thought as pre-paid consumption taxes, while consumption taxes like
4:65:4399:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the VAT and retail sales taxes are viewed as post-paid consumption taxes. In the absence
4:66:4487:24:23:72:516:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of behavioral evidence of any sort, the literature regards these two taxes as equivalent.
4:67:4576:23:23:89:539:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In this paper, we offer an experimental test of the equivalence between consumption
4:68:4659:23:24:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and wage taxes.  We hypothesize that the differential timing in the imposition of these
4:69:4746:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:two taxes leads to different labor-leisure choices, thereby violating the equivalence. Wage
4:70:4837:23:24:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:taxes are collected upon receipt of one’s labor market income, while consumption taxes are
4:71:4927:24:23:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:deferred until one spends this income. A behavioral literature on myopia and present-biased
4:72:5018:23:23:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:preferences (see, e.g., O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999; Angeletos et al. 2001) suggests that
4:73:5105:23:24:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:when the rewards from an activity are experienced immediately but the costs are borne later,
4:74:5197:24:23:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:individuals engage excessively in the activity. Overeating and the widespread phenomenon
4:75:5285:23:24:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of credit card debt funded consumption are two outcomes of such myopia. Similarly, we
4:76:5370:24:23:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:anticipate that individuals will work more when they derive a benefit early on (i.e., earned
4:77:5462:23:23:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:income) and only later incur a cost (i.e., tax levied on consumption) rather than when the
4:78:5552:23:24:72:539:388:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:cost is incurred simultaneously with the receipt of the benefit, as in the case of a wage tax.
4:79:5646:24:23:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We test whether the theoretical equivalence between labor income and consumption taxes
4:80:5732:23:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is upheld or whether our behavioral hypothesis regarding the differential timing of the taxes
4:81:5825:24:23:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:finds support. We introduce an incentivized, two-stage individual choice problem that re-
4:82:5914:23:23:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:quires subjects to allocate their time between leisure and a real-effort task. Their perfor-
4:83:6006:23:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:mance at the real-effort task earns them income, which they allocate in the second stage
4:84:6094:18:16:85:539:253:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:1Deaton (1979) shows that even when labor income tax is restricted to be linear (flat rate cum universal
4:85:6198:16:12:71:539:237:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:demo grant), separability and homotheticity of preferences render commodity taxation redundant. More

4:87:6400:12:12:71:539:213:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:demonstrates that commodity taxation may be redundant even when the labor income tax schedule is not
4:88:6500:12:8:71:158:201:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:set at the optimum.
4:89:6519:8:16:85:540:193:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:2In a neo-classical framework, any two tax schedules that yield the same choice set for a rational individual
4:90:6628:16:12:71:539:177:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:should have no impact on individual choice (nor on government fiscal considerations) and hence should be
4:91:6732:12:12:71:539:165:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:equivalent for tax design. The public finance literature demonstrates the equivalency of several other pairs
4:92:6840:12:12:71:540:153:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:of tax instruments that areprima faciedifferent. Notable examples include social security taxes levied on
4:93:6945:12:0:72:447:141:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:employees and employers and commodity taxes imposed on producers and consumers.
5:94:7025:0:24:72:539:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:between two consumption goods. We design equivalent labor income tax (IT) and consump-
5:95:7111:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tion tax (CT) treatments. InIT, a 50-percent flat wage tax is imposed on earned income.
5:96:7198:23:24:71:539:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:InCT, a 100-percent ad-valorem tax is levied on both consumption goods.  Notice that
5:97:7282:24:23:71:539:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:both tax regimes entail a 50-percent erosion in the individual’s purchasing power without
5:98:7371:23:23:71:539:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:changing the relative prices of the consumption goods. Controlling for differences in labor
5:99:7462:23:24:71:539:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:market productivity and inherent labor-leisure preferences using pre-tax treatments, we test
5:100:7554:24:23:71:515:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:whether these two equivalent tax regimes in fact lead to identical labor-leisure choices.
5:101:7643:23:24:89:539:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Our results reveal that the temporal separation between an individual’s labor market
5:102:7727:24:23:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:allocation and subsequent consumption decisions leads individuals to work longer when faced
5:103:7818:23:23:71:540:528:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:with a consumption tax than with an equivalent wage tax.3This differential labor supply
5:104:7905:23:24:71:539:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:response across tax treatments holds over the entire range of labor market abilities and
5:105:7993:24:23:71:539:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is persistent over time.  This finding bears major implications for tax policy design by
5:106:8081:23:24:71:426:458:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:establishing a novel argument for shifting to a consumption tax base.
5:107:8150:24:23:89:539:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:While ours is the first test of the equivalence between an income and a consumption

5:112:8583:24:23:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:gest that whether the economic incidence of a unit tax is, in fact, independent of the side

5:117:9076:12:12:72:540:237:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:that buyers systematically underestimate the tax burden of a tax levied on sellers and the consequences of
5:118:9182:12:12:72:540:225:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:this misperception for preferences for redistribution. Liebman and Zeckhauser (2004) and Feldman and Ka-
5:119:9286:12:12:72:540:213:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:tuscak (2006) focus on individuals’ misperception of the difference between marginal and average tax rates.
5:120:9393:12:12:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:Chetty et al. (2007) show that posting tax-inclusive prices reduces consumer demand. Our paper also relates
5:121:9500:12:12:72:540:189:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:to an underdeveloped experimental literature on the responsiveness of labor supply decisions to changes in
5:122:9606:12:12:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:the income tax system. Sillamaa (1999) shows that a top marginal income tax rate of zero increases work
5:123:9709:12:12:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:effort. Sutter and Weck-Hannemann (2003) find that tax revenues in a real-effort experiment support the
5:124:9812:12:0:72:189:153:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:existence of a Laffer curve.
6:125:9841:0:24:72:232:739:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:competitiveness of the market.4
6:126:9872:24:23:89:539:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section we detail the experimental
6:127:9963:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:design. Section 3 presents the main results. In section 4, we present a simple theoretical
6:128:10053:24:53:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:framework consistent with our findings and discuss policy implications. Section 5 concludes.
6:129:10145:53:35:72:417:615:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:2  Experimental Design and Procedures
6:130:10182:35:24:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:To test the equivalency between labor income and consumption taxes, we design two tax
6:131:10267:24:23:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:systems that yield identical after-tax budget lines, thereby creating identical labor-leisure in-
6:132:10364:23:24:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:centives. In a between-subjects design, we determine whether subjects indeed make the same
6:133:10454:24:23:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:labor-leisure allocation as predicted by the theory or whether, according to our alternative
6:134:10546:23:23:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:hypothesis, subjects choose to work more in the consumption-tax condition. This compari-
6:135:10634:23:24:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:son of labor-leisure choices in equivalent labor income tax and consumption tax treatments
6:136:10724:24:23:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is the third part of our three-part experiment. The first two parts of the experiment are
6:137:10813:23:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:designed to measure and control for subjects’ work ability and inherent labor-leisure pref-
6:138:10904:24:23:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:erences, respectively. We detail in turn each of these three parts below. The experimental
6:139:10994:23:46:72:355:369:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:instructions for all three parts appear in the Appendix.
6:140:11050:46:31:72:328:323:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:2.1  Three Parts of the Experiment
6:141:11084:31:23:72:235:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:a. Part One (Work Ability)
6:142:11110:23:24:89:539:269:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The common element to all three parts of the experiment is the real-effort work task: each
6:143:11200:24:23:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:subject solves by hand two-digit by two-digit multiplication questions. Part One serves to
6:144:11290:23:24:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:measure each subject’s innate ability or productivity at this task. Our objective is to create
6:145:11384:24:23:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a labor income tax and a theoretically equivalent consumption tax treatment balanced in
6:146:11471:23:18:72:238:175:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:terms of subjects’ work abilities.
6:147:11505:18:0:85:539:157:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:4KK represents the lone violation of the theory and their test uses a bilateral-monopoly market structure.
7:148:11612:0:24:89:539:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:To measure each subject’s work ability, subjects are asked to solve as many multiplication
7:149:11702:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:problems as they can in three minutes. To incentivize subjects, they are paid 0.5 shekel for
7:150:11794:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:each correctly answered question.5Throughout this and the other two parts, the subject
7:151:11880:24:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:may observe both his numbers of correctly and incorrectly answered multiplication questions
7:152:11971:23:23:72:486:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and his cumulative earnings. (See the screenshot for Part One in the Appendix.)
7:153:12050:23:24:89:539:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:At the completion of Part One, while subjects proceeded to Part Two, the software
7:154:12131:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ranked subjects according to the number of correctly solved multiplication questions. We
7:155:12219:23:24:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:applied the rank-sorting algorithm displayed in Table 1 to assign each subject to either the
7:156:12311:24:23:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:labor income tax or consumption tax treatment in Part Three. At the beginning of Part
7:157:12396:23:23:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Three, each subject receives the instructions only for the treatment to which he has been
7:158:12485:23:24:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:assigned. Subjects are not made aware of the ranking algorithm, their overall ranking or the
7:159:12577:24:36:72:409:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:existence of the other treatment in which they do not participate.
7:160:12643:36:37:254:356:445:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:[insert Table 1 here]
7:161:12664:37:23:89:539:408:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The algorithm balances the two tax treatments in terms of the rankings of subjects’
7:162:12747:23:23:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:work abilities. Table 1 indicates how this balance is achieved: the subjects with the highest
7:163:12840:23:24:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and fourth highest abilities are assigned to the consumption tax treatment (CT), while the
7:164:12930:24:23:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:second and third highest ranking subjects are assigned to the labor income tax treatment
7:165:13018:23:24:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(IT). This “snake” pattern of subject assignment continues until all subjects are exhausted.
7:166:13110:24:23:71:539:291:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The result is that if the number of subjects in a session is a multiple of four, the average
7:167:13202:23:23:71:539:268:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ability ranking of the two treatments is identical; otherwise, the average ranking differs by
7:168:13295:23:32:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a mere fraction for sessions with at least 17 subjects (applicable to all four of our sessions).
7:169:13391:32:27:71:313:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:b. Part Two (Labor-Leisure Preferences)
7:170:13430:27:18:89:539:186:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The second part of the experiment measures subjects’ (pre-tax) labor-leisure preferences.
7:171:13519:18:16:85:540:168:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:5One $USD equals about four Israeli shekels. To control for question difficulty across subjects, all subjects
7:172:13628:16:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:saw the same series of randomly chosen multiplication questions in the same order. To minimize the variance
7:173:13735:12:0:72:425:140:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:in question difficulty across questions, we excluded integers ending in “0” or “1”.
8:174:13819:0:24:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:This second part consists of a two-stage, full-information, individual choice problem. In the
8:175:13912:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:first labor-leisure-allocation stage, the individual decides how much of the available three
8:176:14004:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:minutes to devote to work in the form of solving multiplication problems. For each correctly
8:177:14096:24:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:answered question, the subject earns two points that may be exchanged for either of the
8:178:14183:23:23:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:two consumption goods in the second stage (as explained below). The subject may stop
8:179:14267:23:24:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:working at any time during the three-minute round by pressing the “Stop” button.  For
8:180:14352:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:each 15 seconds that the individual chooses not to work (leisure), he earns one unit of the
8:181:14443:23:24:72:539:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:leisure good (a voucher for a bottled soft drink).6(Fractions of 15 seconds left on the
8:182:14530:24:23:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:clock are worthless.) In the second, consumption stage of the round, the individual decides
8:183:14621:23:23:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:how to allocate the points earned from the labor task between the two consumption goods
8:184:14708:23:24:71:539:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(vouchers redeemable for falafel sandwiches or pizza slices). In this pre-tax treatment, each
8:185:14801:24:23:71:464:481:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:point earned can be exchanged for a half falafel sandwich or one pizza slice.7
8:186:14879:23:24:89:539:458:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Compared to Part One, this second part complicates the subject’s decision task in two
8:187:14964:24:23:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:respects: the subject must first decide how to allocate his three-minute endowment between
8:188:15054:23:23:71:539:411:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:labor and leisure, and he must subsequently decide how to allocate his earned income between
8:189:15146:23:24:71:539:388:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the two consumption goods.  Due to these additional complexities, we want to allow the
8:190:15232:24:23:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:subject to repeat Part Two.  At the same time, we recognize that solving multiplication
8:191:15319:23:24:71:539:341:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:questions is mentally fatiguing and that this part’s main purpose is really to provide a
8:192:15407:24:23:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:control for subjects’ preferences. We resolved these tradeoffs by having each subject play
8:193:15497:23:32:71:197:294:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:two rounds of Part Two.
8:194:15520:32:26:71:356:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:c. Part Three (Income tax or Consumption tax)
8:195:15565:26:24:89:539:236:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Part Three of the experiment is identical to Part Two, except that the subject now faces
8:196:15653:24:17:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:either a labor income tax or a consumption tax, depending on the treatment to which he is
8:197:15742:17:16:85:539:195:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:6Because subjects are confined to the lab for the duration of the experiment, the use of a leisure good
8:198:15845:16:8:72:387:179:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:ensures that they indeed derive utility from the time not spent working.
8:199:15917:8:16:85:539:171:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:7Pizza and falafel are the two most popular fast foods in Israel. Pizza is sold whole and by the slice;
8:200:16020:16:0:72:317:155:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:falafel sandwiches are served in a half or full pita bread.
9:201:16080:0:24:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:assigned (according to the sorting algorithm described in Part One). In the labor income
9:202:16168:24:23:72:539:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tax treatment (IT), a 50% wage tax is imposed on subjects’ earnings, meaning that for each
9:203:16258:23:24:72:539:692:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:correctly answered multiplication question the subject earns one point (instead of two).8
9:204:16347:24:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The prices of half falafel sandwiches and pizza slices remain the same as in the pre-tax
9:205:16435:23:23:72:250:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:treatment, namely, one point each.
9:206:16469:23:24:89:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Alternatively, in the consumption tax treatment (CT), a 100% consumption tax is im-
9:207:16552:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:posed on each of the two consumption goods, meaning that a half falafel sandwich and a slice
9:208:16644:23:24:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of pizza now each cost two points (instead of one point each). As in the pre-tax treatment,
9:209:16735:24:23:72:359:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the value of a correctly answered question is two points.
9:210:16792:23:23:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The key feature of these two tax treatments is that the subjects in each treatment face
9:211:16879:23:24:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the identical post-tax budget line: a half falafel sandwich and one pizza slice each cost one
9:212:16972:24:23:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:correctly answered multiplication question, while each soft drink costs 15 seconds not spent
9:213:17064:23:24:72:257:458:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:on solving multiplication questions.9
9:214:17101:24:23:89:539:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The decision complexity of Part Three suggests that allowing subjects to repeat it will
9:215:17188:23:23:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:provide us with more informed estimates of their preferences. At the same time, mental
9:216:17274:23:24:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:fatigue and the intensity associated with solving multiplication problems under time pressure
9:217:17367:24:23:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:severely limits the number of feasible repetitions. Given the centrality of this part of the
9:218:17459:23:18:72:386:341:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:experiment, we chose to have each subject play three rounds.
9:219:17519:18:16:85:539:323:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:8This treatment exemplifies the need to convert correct answers to smaller units. If we had paid subjects
9:220:17624:16:12:72:540:307:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:directly in correctly answered questions, a subject who answers an odd number of questions would be left
9:221:17728:12:8:72:281:295:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:with a fraction of a question after the wage tax.
9:222:17777:8:16:85:539:287:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:9To illustrate the equivalence, consider a subject who correctly answers five questions in 120 seconds,
9:223:17880:16:11:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:leaving 60 seconds on the clock. In bothITandCT, the 60 seconds not devoted to the work task earn the
9:224:17981:11:12:72:540:260:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:subject four units of the leisure good, bottled soft drinks. InIT, five questions pay five after-tax points,
9:225:18089:12:12:72:539:248:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:exchangeable for five half falafel sandwiches, five pizza slices or some combination thereof.  InCT, five
9:226:18194:12:12:71:539:236:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:questions pay ten points, but the 100% tax on consumption goods make them exchangeable also for five half
9:227:18299:12:0:71:351:224:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:falafel sandwiches, five pizza slices or some combination thereof.
10:228:18366:0:32:72:339:739:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:2.2  Logic underlying Design Choices
10:229:18402:32:23:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Our experimental design is non-standard in several respects. Perhaps the most distinctive
10:230:18491:23:23:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:feature of our design is the payment in kind, rather than in cash. We steered away from cash
10:231:18583:23:24:72:540:661:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:or cash equivalents such as cell-phone credit in the choice of goods in order to avoid a corner
10:232:18678:24:23:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:solution in subjects’ labor-leisure allocation. Put differently, if either the leisure good or one
10:233:18776:23:24:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of the consumption goods were overly attractive, subjects may have exclusively chosen this
10:234:18866:24:23:72:366:590:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:good and remained insensitive to the imposition of a tax.
10:235:18923:23:23:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We include two consumption goods along with the leisure good to capture in the simplest
10:236:19010:23:24:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:way the two typical tradeoffs faced by individuals: time allocation between labor and leisure
10:237:19103:24:23:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and earned-income allocation between commodities.  We selected in-kind goods that are
10:238:19188:23:24:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:similarly attractive to one another for a wide range of students, again to avoid a corner
10:239:19277:24:23:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:solution. Months prior to the experiment, we conducted a questionnaire to determine the
10:240:19364:23:23:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:set of goods to include in our design. The questionnaire elicits subjects’ preferences over
10:241:19455:23:24:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:different bundles of goods. The results revealed that falafel and pizza are equally well liked
10:242:19549:24:23:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:substitutes and neither is chosen to the exclusion of the leisure good, soft drinks, which
10:243:19639:23:24:72:202:380:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:serves as a complement.10
10:244:19664:24:23:89:539:356:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Payment according to subjects’ cumulative earnings across all rounds would invite sati-
10:245:19751:23:23:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ation, which would lead to different labor-leisure-consumption choices across rounds. This
10:246:19841:23:24:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:between-round variation is undesirable since it is an artifact of the payment calculation.
10:247:19931:24:23:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Accordingly, each subject was paid based on his results from one randomly chosen round
10:248:20017:23:24:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:from each of the second and third parts of the experiment. This payment method serves to
10:249:20105:24:23:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:avoid scenarios in which subjects concentrate their labor supply in one round and opt for
10:250:20194:23:18:72:332:216:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:leisure in the remaining round(s) of the treatment.
10:251:20245:18:16:81:540:198:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:10The questionnaire asked each subject to allocate a hypothetical income among three goods in each
10:252:20343:16:12:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:of the distinct bundles of goods. We conducted this questionnaire on 69 students at locations (Tel Aviv
10:253:20446:12:12:72:540:170:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:University and Sapir College) different from the site of our experiments (Ben-Gurion University) to avoid
10:254:20551:12:12:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:any subjects from participating in both the questionnaire and subsequent experiment. The detailed findings
10:255:20657:12:0:72:291:146:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:from the questionnaire are available upon request.
11:256:20708:0:24:89:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The first part allows us to balance the work-ability composition of theITandCTtreat-
11:257:20792:24:23:71:539:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:ments and to explain a subject’s labor-leisure choice as a function of his observed labor
11:258:20881:23:24:71:539:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:productivity.  The second part provides an own-subject control for inherent labor-leisure
11:259:20970:24:23:71:539:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:preferences. The time difference the subject devotes to the work task between the tax and
11:260:21059:23:46:71:418:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the pre-tax treatments will serve as one of our dependent measures.

11:262:21152:31:23:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:To ensure that our results are not attributable to subjects’ misunderstanding of the rules of
11:263:21245:23:24:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the experiment or the implications of the tax, we gave subjects a short quiz prior to beginning
11:264:21340:24:23:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Parts Two and Three to verify their knowledge of the prices of all goods.11(Appendix
11:265:21424:23:24:71:539:498:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A includes these quizzes for the referees.) More important for understanding, we limited
11:266:21512:24:23:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:participation to economics students. Eighty undergraduate majors in economics participated
11:267:21602:23:23:71:539:451:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in one of four sessions at Ben-Gurion University. The entire experiment took about one hour
11:268:21693:23:24:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and 45 minutes. The average cash payment from Part One was 3.0 NIS, while the average
11:269:21778:24:23:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:payments in vouchers based on one randomly chosen round from both Parts Two and Three
11:270:21863:23:24:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:were 7.7 bottled drinks, 6.3 half falafel sandwiches and 7.0 pizza slices. The vouchers were
11:271:21955:24:53:71:274:357:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:valid for redemption for up to one year.

11:274:22097:24:23:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:confirms the effectiveness of the ability-sorting algorithm in balancing the two tax treatments
11:275:22192:23:24:71:540:222:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:in terms of subjects’ abilities. The average ability inITis 5.87 questions compared to 5.60

11:278:22465:16:12:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:The fact that the answers change from the no-tax to the tax treatment highlights for the subject the effect

12:286:23009:24:23:72:540:572:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:respectively. These numbers reveal that on average the substitution effect dominates any
12:287:23097:23:24:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:possible positive income effect: subjects respond to the imposition of a tax by significantly
12:288:23190:24:23:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:reducing their labor supply in both treatments (p<0.01 for bothITandCT). Of greater
12:289:23273:23:23:72:539:502:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:interest, subjects reduce their labor supply by 1/3 or 44.5 seconds on average inITcompared
12:290:23364:23:24:72:539:479:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to the no-tax treatment, while inCTthe decrease is only about 15% of the no-tax amount or

12:293:23632:24:23:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(p =.03) show that subjects’ labor supply is significantly more responsive to the income tax
12:294:23724:23:23:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:than the consumption tax, as hypothesized. This differential response to the type of tax can
12:295:23816:23:24:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:be seen in the distribution of subjects’ average labor supply responses displayed in Figure

12:299:24047:36:23:89:539:242:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The figure also reveals that about a quarter of the subjects (21/80) curiously increase
12:300:24134:23:24:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:their time devoted to the work task following the introduction of the tax. Also in line with
12:301:24226:24:23:72:464:195:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:our hypothesis, 13 of these participated inCTcompared to only eight inIT.
12:302:24299:23:23:89:539:172:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We examined the two groups to determine whether observable differences may explain
12:303:24381:23:0:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:their differential reactions to the tax. Table 3 shows no significant differences in terms of

13:305:24565:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:those who lowered and those who raised their post-tax labor supply. The similarity of these
13:306:24656:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:two groups in terms of ability and labor supply contradicts the conventional depiction of the
13:307:24749:24:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:backward-bending portion of the labor supply curve as applicable to high-income individuals:
13:308:24841:23:34:72:490:645:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:there is nothing distinctive about the subjects with a negative income elasticity.12

13:321:25668:24:23:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:hypothesis: subjects reduce their labor supply by an additional 24 seconds on average in
13:322:25756:23:24:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:response to the income tax compared to the equivalent consumption tax. Repeating the
13:323:25840:24:23:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:exercise with the subject’s own ability as a control yields a similar result: the coefficient of

13:325:25984:18:16:81:540:190:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:12One explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior is that the subject aspires to a target income in
13:326:26090:16:12:72:540:174:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:order to purchase a specific number of falafel sandwiches or pizza slices. To achieve this, the subject works
13:327:26199:12:12:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:longer in the presence of the tax than in its absence. Camerer et al. (1997) found that New York City cab
13:328:26304:12:11:72:540:150:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:drivers – another not particularly high income group – set a daily earnings target, which led them to work
13:329:26410:11:0:72:324:139:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:longer hours on slow days and to quit early on busy days.
14:330:26469:0:24:89:539:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Let us now make use of the entire panel dataset for all 80 subjects, each of whom par-

14:334:26821:23:23:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:subjects reduce their labor supply by 39 seconds on average when exposed to the income tax,
14:335:26912:23:24:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:while those who face the consumption tax work 21 seconds less compared to their pre-tax
14:336:26999:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:labor supply. Both of these coefficients are significantly different from the (omitted) no-tax

14:343:27647:24:23:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:stitution effect would render the distortive effect of a tax more pronounced for high-ability
14:344:27740:23:23:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:individuals, with an income effect potentially offsetting this pattern to some extent. The

14:346:27923:24:23:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:fact, neither of the interaction terms (or their squared terms when included) is significant,
14:347:28016:23:24:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:while the gap in the labor supply between the two tax treatments remains highly significant
14:348:28107:24:31:72:122:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(p< .01).

14:350:28137:30:24:89:539:256:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Learning is a common phenomenon in individual choice experiments. With successive

14:353:28394:24:23:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:specific dummy variables are included in all of the above regressions in Table 5. However,
14:354:28484:23:23:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:since none of the round dummies is significant in any of the regressions, they are not reported.

15:358:28849:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:compared to (4) and the main conclusions remain the same: both coefficients continue to be

15:364:29354:24:23:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(45 of the total 400 rounds) are right-censored with subjects devoting all of their time to

15:372:30065:24:23:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:all leisure is revealed in 21 instances in which the subject stopped the clock between 1 and 6

15:376:30424:23:24:89:539:271:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Revealingly, 17 of the 21 instances in which the clock was stopped before 7 seconds

15:378:30593:23:24:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to consume all leisure in the no-tax treatment. Put another way, all instances of voluntary

16:385:31107:23:0:89:422:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f15:In Tobit regressions (7) and (8), the dependent variableworktime

16:389:31288:23:23:72:539:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the OLS regressions, the coefficients onITandCTcontinue to differ significantly from zero
16:390:31377:23:24:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and from one other at the 1% level. Again, none of the round dummy variables included (but
16:391:31467:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:not reported) in (7) is significant. Alternatively, we account for possible learning in Tobit
16:392:31560:23:24:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:(8) by excluding the first round in both the no-tax and the tax treatments, as we did in OLS
16:393:31652:24:23:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:regression (6). Labor supply in these later rounds of the tax treatments remain significantly

16:396:31863:54:35:72:326:451:17:g_d0_f6:17:g_d0_f6:4  A Theoretical Explanation
16:397:31891:35:24:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In this section, we present a simple behavioral model of myopic agents.  The model is
16:398:31976:24:23:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consistent with our main finding that individuals choose a higher labor supply under a
16:399:32062:23:23:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consumption tax than under an equivalent labor income tax.  We employ this model to
16:400:32145:23:24:72:513:346:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:demonstrate that a shift from an income to a consumption tax reduces excess burden.
16:401:32228:24:23:89:539:322:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Consider a standard labor supply model with a representative individual whose utility is
16:402:32316:23:24:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:given byU(c, `) =c−h(`), wherecdenotes consumption,`denotes labor andhis assumed
16:403:32396:24:23:72:305:275:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:to be strictly increasing and strictly convex.15
16:404:32444:23:18:89:539:252:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The production function employs labor only and exhibits constant returns to scale. We
16:405:32529:18:15:81:539:234:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:14The Tobit regressions are estimated using Gauss-Hermite quadrature with 12 points of evaluation
16:406:32626:15:12:72:540:219:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:(Stata’s default). As a robustness check, we estimate (7) and (8) based on both 8 and 16 quadrature points.
16:407:32733:12:12:72:539:207:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:The coefficients onITandCTchange by less than 1% and remain highly significant. Theabilityicoefficient
16:408:32835:12:12:72:540:195:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:is more sensitive, shrinking by as much as 40% for higher accuracy of 16 points and increasing up to 59% in
16:409:32942:12:9:72:327:183:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:(8) (but still insignificant) when accuracy falls to 8 points.
16:410:33004:9:15:81:540:174:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:15The quasi-linear specification (used by Diamond 1998, among others) is without loss in generality and
16:411:33107:15:0:72:203:159:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:is assumed for simplicity only.
17:412:33140:0:24:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:denote byw >0 the individual’s hourly productivity (hence the competitive wage rate).
17:413:33225:24:23:71:539:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We normalize the price of the consumption good to unity, with no loss in generality. The
17:414:33313:23:33:71:358:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:individual is faced with the following budget constraint:
17:415:33370:33:33:221:540:659:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f8:`·w·(1−t) +τ=c·(1 +α·s),(1)
17:416:33397:33:24:72:539:626:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:wheret <1 is the (flat) tax rate on labor income (wages),τdenotes a lump-sum transfer (a
17:417:33485:24:23:72:539:602:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tax if negative) andsis the tax rate on consumption. The parameter 0≤α≤1 measures the
17:418:33570:23:24:72:539:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:individual’s degree of myopia. Whenα= 1 the individual is fully rational and perceives the
17:419:33660:24:23:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consumption tax correctly, in accordance with neo-classical consumer theory. Whenα <1
17:420:33745:23:23:71:476:532:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:the individual underestimates the burden associated with a consumption tax.16
17:421:33822:23:24:89:539:509:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We now demonstrate that when the individual underestimates the consumption tax bur-
17:422:33905:24:23:71:539:485:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:den, levying a consumption tax entails a smaller excess burden than that associated with
17:423:33993:23:24:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:an equivalent wage tax (while the individual is indifferent between the two tax regimes).
17:424:34082:24:29:71:240:438:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Formally, we prove the following:
17:425:34115:29:23:71:539:409:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:Proposition:   Whenα <1, a shift from a wage tax to a consumption tax generates
17:426:34194:23:29:71:460:386:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:strictly higher tax revenues while leaving the individual’s utility unchanged.
17:427:34272:29:24:71:540:357:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:Proof:   Consider a wage tax regime (BW Tin Figure 2); that is, we sett >0 ands=τ= 0.
17:428:34357:24:23:71:539:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Denote the wage tax rate bytW T. Let`W TandUW Tdenote the individual’s choice of labor
17:429:34443:23:23:71:538:310:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f16:supply under the wage tax regime and his corresponding utility level, respectively. Let`NT
17:430:34533:23:24:71:540:287:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:be the individual’s choice of labor supply under a no-tax regime (i.e., settings=t=τ= 0,
17:431:34621:24:23:71:540:263:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:given byBNTin Figure 2). By virtue of our quasi-linear specification,`NTequals the choice
17:432:34710:23:24:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of labor supplied under a lump-sum tax regime (i.e., settingτ <0 ands=t= 0 ), which
17:433:34793:24:23:71:540:216:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:entails no deadweight loss.  Note further that`NT> `W T, since labor supply is strictly

18:440:35287:37:23:89:540:642:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:We first examine the simple caseα= 0. Consider a consumption tax regime (i.e.,s >0

18:444:35486:30:23:71:540:542:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:In words, the consumption tax rate is set such that the consumption-labor pair, (cNT, `NT),

18:446:35666:23:24:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:is oblivious to the tax), an individual faced with the consumption tax regime chooses to work

20:520:38884:36:23:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Two often-raised arguments in favor of a shift to a consumption tax are the administrative
20:521:38974:23:23:72:540:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:advantages it offers over an income tax (i.e., simplicity of measuring consumption versus la-
20:522:39067:23:24:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:bor income and ease of collection and enforcement) and the elimination of the inter-temporal
20:523:39159:24:23:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:distortion of consumption allocation caused by the taxation of capital income. Our paper
20:524:39247:23:24:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:uncovers evidence for an additional perceptual advantage: post-paid consumption taxes en-
20:525:39336:24:23:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:courage higher labor supply than equivalent pre-paid wage taxes.  This finding holds for
20:526:39424:23:23:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:both men and women and across the spectrum of labor market productivities. Consumption
20:527:39510:23:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:taxes also appear to reduce the likelihood of voluntary unemployment. Whether these con-
20:528:39598:24:23:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:clusions would hold over the longer run remains an open research question. For our part and
20:529:39689:23:24:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:constrained by the tiresome nature of our real-effort task, we permitted learning by having
20:530:39780:24:23:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:each subject repeat the same labor-leisure choice over several rounds. Over this horizon, the
20:531:39873:23:23:72:464:446:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:observed significantly higher labor supply under a consumption tax endures.
20:532:39948:23:24:89:539:423:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:The mechanism at work appears to be similar to behavioral explanations for overeating
20:533:40033:24:23:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and the excess credit card debt phenomenon. Myopic individuals underestimate the future
20:534:40120:23:24:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:costs of current consumption decisions. Similarly, we observe that taxpayers underestimate
20:535:40210:24:23:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the costs to be incurred from taxes levied on their deferred consumption when they make
20:536:40297:23:24:72:213:329:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f12:their labor-leisure choices.17
20:537:40327:24:23:89:539:305:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Myopia in our setting, as in the above-mentioned examples, harms the individual by
20:538:40409:23:23:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:leading to sub-optimal choices (overworking in our case).  This creates the potential for
20:539:40498:23:24:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:a welfare-improving government response. Indeed, our results bear major implications for
20:540:40586:24:23:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tax policy design. The public finance optimal tax literature is premised on the equivalence
20:541:40677:23:24:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:between a wage tax and a consumption tax. We demonstrate a major difference between
20:542:40760:24:17:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:two types of consumption tax: a pre-paid consumption tax such as the individual cash-flow
20:543:40849:17:16:81:539:171:7:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f10:17We submit that our findings (based on economics students) understate the extent to which labor income
20:544:40952:16:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:taxes hurt labor supply relative to consumption taxes. A population without economics training is likely to
20:545:41059:12:0:72:539:143:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:be even more susceptible to the myopia underlying the differential labor supply responses to the two taxes.
21:546:41168:0:24:72:540:739:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:tax (that could take the form of a traditional Section 408 Individual Retirement Account),
21:547:41258:24:23:72:540:715:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:which is essentially a wage tax, and a post-paid consumption tax (such as VAT). While
21:548:41343:23:24:72:540:692:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:much of the policy reform debate in the U.S. focuses on the former as a leading candidate
21:549:41432:24:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to replace income tax, our evidence makes a case for adopting the latter, since post-paid
21:550:41521:23:23:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:consumption taxes appear to mitigate labor disincentives, thereby enhancing the efficiency
21:551:41611:23:24:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of the tax system. In particular, we show that for any wage tax rate, one can appropriately
21:552:41702:24:23:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:choose a consumption tax rate below the theoretically equivalent level to achieve higher labor
21:553:41796:23:54:72:500:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:supply and therefore higher tax revenues, while maintaining the individual’s utility.

29:741:53267:14:14:73:521:647:12:Times:12:Times:Like  the  time-allocation  part  of  the  second  part,  you  are  given  three  minutes  during  which 
29:742:53372:14:13:73:521:633:12:Times:12:Times:time you must decide how much of the three minutes to devote to answering multiplication

29:745:53660:14:14:73:521:592:12:Times:12:Times:answered question earns you two points. But with the tax on the points you will keep half of
