2:31:1578:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This paper estimates the impact of income on the long-term care utilization of elderly Americans using
2:32:1680:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:a natural experiment that led otherwise similar retirees to receive significantly different Social Security
2:33:1787:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:payments based on their year of birth.  Using data from the 1993 and 1995 waves of the AHEAD,
2:34:1880:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:we estimate instrumental variables models and find that a positive permanent income shock lowers
2:35:1976:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:nursing home use but increases the utilization of paid home care services.  We find some suggestive
2:36:2075:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:evidence that the effects are due to substitution of home care for nursing home utilization.  The magnitude
2:37:2182:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of these estimates suggests that moderate reductions in post-retirement income would significantly
2:38:2280:14:42:72:368:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:alter long-term utilization patterns among elderly individuals.

3:60:2755:0:13:72:151:708:144:Times:144:Times:C:I. Introduction 
3:61:2771:13:28:108:538:695:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The financing of long-term care is an increasingly important issue for the elderly. Nearly 
3:62:2862:28:28:72:528:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:70% of individuals living to age 65 will require some long-term care assistance, with over one-
3:63:2957:28:27:72:542:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:third requiring some time in a nursing home (Kemper, Komisar, and Alecxih 2005).  On average, 
3:64:3051:27:28:72:541:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the present discounted value of lifetime long-term care expenditures is $47,000 (in 2005 dollars), 
3:65:3150:28:27:71:541:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but the distribution is heavily skewed with 16% of elderly individuals incurring over $100,000 in 
3:66:3248:27:28:71:541:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lifetime expenditures and 5% incurring over $250,000.  Although many individuals receive some 
3:67:3342:28:28:71:518:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long-term care coverage under Medicaid and a small number of individuals purchase private 
3:68:3432:28:27:71:530:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coverage, long-term care represents, on average, the largest source of out-of-pocket health care 
3:69:3529:27:28:71:233:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:spending for elderly individuals.  
3:70:3564:28:27:107:511:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In this context, future reductions in post-retirement income could dramatically alter 
3:71:3650:27:28:71:496:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elderly individuals’ patterns of long-term care service utilization. Moreover, individuals 
3:72:3741:28:28:72:542:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:generally prefer long-term care in the least restrictive, most home-like setting possible (Kane and 
3:73:3841:28:27:72:536:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Kane 2001), suggesting important welfare effects as individuals transition across long-term care 
3:74:3938:27:28:72:507:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:settings.  For example, Mattimore and colleagues (1997) found that 30% of elderly survey 
3:75:4027:28:27:72:522:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:respondents would rather die than enter a nursing home and an additional 26% indicated they 
3:76:4119:27:28:72:537:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were very unwilling to move to an institutional setting. Similarly, Grabowski and Gruber (2007) 
3:77:4215:28:27:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have shown that state Medicaid payment rules have no effect on overall nursing home utilization, 
3:78:4312:27:28:72:506:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggesting that demand for nursing home care is relatively inelastic with respect to public 
3:79:4404:28:28:72:175:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:program generosity.  
3:80:4425:28:27:108:541:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Surprisingly however, little is known about how income influences formal long-term care 
3:81:4513:27:28:72:512:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:utilization. Using data from the Channeling Demonstration, higher income was found to be 
3:82:4602:28:27:72:534:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:associated with a greater probability of formal care (Kemper 1992). Using National Long-Term 
3:83:4695:27:0:72:529:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Care Survey data, income did not have a statistically meaningful effect on nursing home entry, 
4:84:4791:0:27:72:500:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but it had a positive association with paid home care (Ettner 1994). However, a potential 
4:85:4881:27:28:71:536:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:problem with these earlier studies is that unobserved characteristics may be correlated with both 
4:86:4979:28:27:72:507:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:an individual’s income and the propensity to use long-term care services. For example, an 
4:87:5069:27:28:71:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individual in poorer health may have both lower income and higher long-term care utilization, or 
4:88:5166:28:28:71:541:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individuals with higher incomes may have unobservable preferences for living independently.  In 
4:89:5262:28:27:71:541:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this study, we address this issue of endogeneity by relying on a natural experiment that generated 
4:90:5361:27:28:71:532:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:large, plausibly exogenous variation in permanent Social Security income for otherwise similar 
4:91:5456:28:27:71:541:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individuals based on their year of birth.  The Social Security benefits “notch”, which is described 
4:92:5556:27:28:71:499:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in detail below, has been used by others to examine the effect of income on labor supply 
4:93:5645:28:28:71:533:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(Krueger and Pischke 1992), prescription drug use (Moran and Simon 2006), mortality (Snyder 
4:94:5737:28:27:71:542:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Evans 2006) and elderly living arrangements (Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry 2005). The goal 
4:95:5832:27:28:71:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in this study is to use the variation based on the notch to examine the effect of permanent income 
4:96:5931:28:27:71:287:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on long-term care utilization across settings. 
4:97:5978:27:28:107:516:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The conceptual framework for this paper is based on economic models of household 
4:98:6059:28:27:71:515:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decision-making in the care of a disabled individual (e.g., Pezzin, Kemper, and Reschovsky 
4:99:6150:27:28:71:489:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1996). In this model, utility is a function of private goods, leisure, the elderly person’s 
4:100:6242:28:28:71:519:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:functioning and the household’s preferences (e.g., for independence). Under this framework, 
4:101:6334:28:27:71:514:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:households jointly choose long-term care services and living arrangements. Households are 
4:102:6424:27:28:71:539:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assumed to maximize their utility subject to constraints on their budget and their time. The effect 
4:103:6524:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of income on overall long-term care utilization depends on how income influences the choice of 
4:104:6619:27:28:71:532:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long-term care services and living arrangement. That is, certain long-term care services may be 
4:105:6715:28:28:71:491:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:normal goods while others may be inferior, due, perhaps, to the levels of independence 
4:106:6802:28:0:71:541:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:associated with different types of services. Paid home care is typically considered a normal good, 
5:107:6902:0:27:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggesting higher household income is expected to increase the use of paid care use. However, 
5:108:6996:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:given the disutility associated with nursing home entry discussed above, nursing home care is 
5:109:7090:28:27:72:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:likely an inferior good, suggesting higher income will lead to less nursing home care, ceteris 
5:110:7185:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:paribus. Thus, we predict greater household income will increase the use of paid home care, but 
5:111:7281:28:28:72:258:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lead to less use of nursing home care.  
5:112:7321:28:27:108:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We develop estimates of the effect of a permanent shock in Social Security income on 
5:113:7406:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:formal long-term care utilization among households headed by beneficiaries with less than a high 
5:114:7503:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:school education, approximately 45 percent of our sample.  Using data from the 1993 and 1995 
5:115:7596:27:28:72:523:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:waves of the Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), our IV estimates 
5:116:7683:28:28:72:491:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that a permanent Social Security income shock had a moderate but statistically 
5:117:7770:28:27:71:385:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:insignificant effect on overall formal long-term care utilization.   
5:118:7839:27:28:107:522:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:However, we find this overall effect masks the effects of income on different types of 
5:119:7926:28:27:72:535:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long-term care utilization.  When we decompose the total effects, we find evidence that positive 
5:120:8023:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social Security income shocks had a negative effect on nursing home entry, but a positive effect 
5:121:8120:28:27:71:520:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on the use of paid home care. Specifically, a $1,000 (or 10 percent) increase in annual Social 
5:122:8215:27:28:71:514:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Security income for those in this low-education group would decrease the likelihood of any 
5:123:8306:28:28:72:527:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home use by 24%-34% (relative to mean) and increase the likelihood of receiving any 
5:124:8398:28:27:72:239:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:paid home care use by 15%-16%.  
5:125:8430:27:28:108:533:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Although several pathways may lead to the increased use of home care and lower use of 
5:126:8516:28:27:72:503:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home care, we find some support for the hypothesis that higher permanent Social 
5:127:8604:27:28:72:521:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Security income causes individuals to substitute home care for nursing home care rather than 
5:128:8697:28:0:72:535:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:inducing home care use among individuals who would not have otherwise used long-term care.  
6:129:8790:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The substitution hypothesis behind our findings appears more likely than explanations related to 
6:130:8887:27:28:72:481:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income-induced improvements in health or resulting changes in Medicaid eligibility. 
6:131:8971:28:27:107:521:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a brief description of the 
6:132:9060:27:28:71:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social Security benefits notch. In Section III, we describe our data and empirical strategy. In 
6:133:9156:28:28:71:490:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Section IV, we present our results, and in Section V, we test the hypothesis that higher 
6:134:9245:28:27:71:530:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:permanent Social Security income leads individuals to substitute different types of care for one 
6:135:9342:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:another.  In Section VI, we discuss the implications of our results for Social Security reform and 
6:136:9441:28:27:71:494:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other shocks to post-retirement permanent income.  Finally, Section VI provides a brief

6:140:9575:27:28:71:528:405:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: This section provides a brief overview of the Social Security benefits notch (see papers 
6:141:9664:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cited in the previous section for more detailed accounts). Social Security payments are based on 
6:142:9761:27:28:71:518:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lifetime earnings. Prior to 1972, neither lifetime earnings nor post-retirement payments were 
6:143:9855:28:27:71:532:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:indexed for inflation, but rather periodically adjusted by Congress. In 1972, Congress amended 
6:144:9950:27:28:71:527:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Social Security Act to provide automatic indexation of credited earnings for those workers 
6:145:10045:28:28:71:530:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:who had not yet retired, which created an unanticipated windfall for workers from certain birth 
6:146:10141:28:27:71:534:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts because of an error that led the prior earnings of these workers to be doubly indexed for 
6:147:10239:27:28:71:540:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:inflation. The high rate of inflation over the following years led to a large increase in benefits for 
6:148:10342:28:27:71:541:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the affected cohorts. In 1977, Congress passed another law to eliminate the double indexation for 
6:149:10440:27:28:71:536:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:future cohorts of retirees. This law change created a large reduction in Social Security payments 
6:150:10538:28:28:71:524:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for those cohorts born in 1917 or later relative to the preceding cohorts. Importantly however, 
6:151:10634:28:0:71:523:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts born prior to 1917 (near retirement in 1977) retained doubly indexed benefits under a 
7:152:10729:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:grandfather provision. Taken together, these law changes and the high rate of inflation over the 
7:153:10826:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mid 1970s created a large and permanent difference in Social Security payments across birth 
7:154:10918:28:27:72:516:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts, which came to be called the Social Security Benefits Notch. Because these benefits 
7:155:11010:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes were unanticipated and otherwise outside the control of retirees, they are a valid natural 
7:156:11109:28:28:72:439:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:experiment for examining income/wealth effects among elderly individuals. 
7:157:11183:28:27:71:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Figure 1 displays a measure of Social Security benefits that differ across birth cohort only 
7:158:11276:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:due to legislative changes in benefits rather than differences in observable characteristics by birth 
7:159:11378:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohort.  Each birth cohort’s benefits were computed with identical real earnings histories and the 
7:160:11477:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social Security Administration’s ANYPIA program as detailed in Engelhardt et al. (2005).  We 
7:161:11570:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:also depict the best fit line between birth cohort and average household Social Security benefits, 
7:162:11669:28:27:72:534:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:separately for low and high education groups.  For both high and low education individuals, the 
7:163:11765:27:28:72:524:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:figure clearly shows that beneficiaries who differed only in birth cohort received significantly 
7:164:11862:28:27:72:537:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:different levels of Social Security benefits due to these legislative changes to the Social Security 
7:165:11963:27:28:72:511:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Act.  The benefits for cohorts born between approximately 1911 and 1917 are significantly 
7:166:12053:28:27:72:516:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:above the trend line, designating beneficiaries who benefitted from the double indexation of 
7:167:12146:27:28:72:116:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:benefits. 
7:168:12156:28:28:108:523:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The 1977 law raised the covered earnings maximum such that the fraction of earnings 
7:169:12240:28:27:72:510:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:used to calculate Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) was greater for high-income 
7:170:12326:27:28:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:workers with no change in the AIME for low-income workers. This law introduced earnings-
7:171:12414:28:27:72:522:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level-by-year-of-birth variation in Social Security benefits.  This variation can be observed in 
7:172:12511:27:28:72:518:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 1 with the relatively large increase in average annual Social Security income for high 
7:173:12605:28:28:72:530:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:education individuals beginning with cohorts born after 1920. Indeed, individuals born in 1930 
7:174:12700:28:0:72:522:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have roughly equal Social Security income to the notch cohorts. Given this issue, the notch is 
8:175:12796:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:much more powerful for low-wage earners when including a broader set of birth cohorts (1900-
8:176:12888:27:28:72:490:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1930) in the sample.  We formally test the predictive power of the notch in Section III.

8:180:13018:28:27:72:508:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: The Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) is a longitudinal 
8:181:13095:27:28:72:501:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:survey of community-based elderly individuals born in 1923 or earlier and their spouses, 
8:182:13184:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regardless of age. The data that comprise the 1993 wave of the AHEAD survey were collected 
8:183:13275:27:28:72:539:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:between October 1993 and July 1994 on 8,223 individuals from 6,046 households for a response 
8:184:13368:28:28:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rate of just over 80%. African Americans, Mexican-Hispanics, and residents of the state of 
8:185:13459:28:27:72:522:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Florida were sampled at about 1.8 times the probability of the general population, but sample 
8:186:13553:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:weights are available to adjust for this and other non-representative aspects of the sample design. 
8:187:13653:28:27:72:518:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:A follow-up AHEAD survey was conducted in 1995, and exit interviews were conducted by 
8:188:13739:27:28:71:397:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:relatives of AHEAD respondents who died before the 1995 survey. 
8:189:13803:28:27:71:533:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Our primary reference period of analysis is between the 1993 and 1995 waves (Waves 1 
8:190:13888:27:28:71:528:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 2) of the AHEAD survey.1  We choose this time period for a number of reasons.  First, the 
8:191:13982:28:28:72:528:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:initial wave of the AHEAD survey sampled only community-dwelling individuals.  Therefore, 
8:192:14072:28:27:71:493:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:using only the 1993 wave would lead to a downward bias in the level of long-term care 
8:193:14158:27:28:72:523:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:utilization (particularly nursing home utilization) prior to the 1993 interview.  Second, we are 
8:194:14255:28:41:72:511:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unable to pool the 1993 and 1995 waves together because of variable concordance issues.2  
8:195:14345:41:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
8:196:14393:7:16:72:516:136:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:1 If a respondent died before the 1995 wave, the reference period is from the 1993 interview date to the date of 
8:197:14506:16:7:72:99:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:death. 
8:198:14513:7:16:72:534:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2 The 1993 wave asked about utilization over the prior 12 months, and subsequent AHEAD interviews asked about 
8:199:14623:16:12:72:521:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:utilization since the last interview.  AHEAD respondents were re-interviewed in 1995, and then merged into the 
8:200:14734:12:11:72:532:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:HRS sample in 1998.  Therefore, the length of the reference period is approximately 2 years for 1995 respondents, 
8:201:14848:11:0:72:214:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:and 3 years for 1998 respondents.   
9:202:14885:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, using only the 1995 wave would omit respondents who died between the two waves, a 
9:203:14976:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population that is perhaps more likely to use long-term care services.  Similar data limitations 
9:204:15073:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:inhibit the use of data collected on AHEAD cohorts after the survey was merged with the Health 
9:205:15168:27:28:72:232:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Retirement Study in 1998.3   
9:206:15201:28:28:108:531:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We are unable to measure informal care over this time period due to survey limitations; 
9:207:15289:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:however, we report the relationship between income and informal care utilization over the four 
9:208:15384:27:28:71:501:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:weeks prior to the 1993 survey in the appendix.4  Finally, because exit interviews among 
9:209:15473:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decedents who died in a nursing home did not ask about home care utilization, these individuals 
9:210:15569:27:28:72:540:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are not included in our sample when we examine paid home care use between the 1993 and 1995 
9:211:15661:28:28:72:504:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:waves.  Therefore, we also perform our analysis of paid home care use over the period 12 
9:212:15750:28:27:72:482:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:months prior to the 1993 interview.  These results are also reported in the appendix.

9:214:15859:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: Because the AHEAD collects information from both respondents and their spouses, we 
9:215:15942:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have multiple observations in certain households. The unit of observation in our analyses is the 
9:216:16039:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individual, but the key independent variable in our study, Social Security income, is measured at 
9:217:16137:27:28:72:494:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the level of the household based on the primary Social Security beneficiary. In terms of 
9:218:16226:28:28:72:513:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:constructing our benefits notch instrument, the key issue is the year of birth for the primary 
9:219:16321:28:27:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:beneficiary. Thus, we employed a series of rules for identifying the primary beneficiary (Moran 
9:220:16417:27:28:72:516:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Simon 2006; Snyder and Evans 2006). Because the majority of married women in these 
9:221:16504:28:18:72:535:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts qualified for benefits through their husband’s earnings history, the male member of two-

9:223:16648:7:16:72:537:159:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:3 In the HRS/AHEAD waves of 1998 and 2000, weak instrument bias becomes a serious concern due to diminished

9:225:16873:12:11:72:540:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:not strong enough to obtain reliable IV estimates.  We also encounter weak instrument problems in the 1995 wave if 
9:226:16988:11:12:72:529:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:we restrict the sample to those with forward-looking measures of long-term care utilization (i.e. between the 1995

9:228:17162:7:16:72:525:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:4 We are unable to use measures for informal care in 1995 because these questions were only asked of those who 
9:229:17273:16:11:72:538:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:screened in for disability, and the informal care questions excluded care from spouses (the most important source of 
9:230:17390:11:0:72:134:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:informal care). 
10:231:17407:0:27:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:person households was designated as the primary beneficiary and his birth year was used to 
10:232:17498:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assign individuals within those households to our treatment and control groups. In the case of 
10:233:17593:28:27:72:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:widowed/divorced females, the deceased or former husband was designated as the primary 
10:234:17680:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:beneficiary. However, because the AHEAD does not provide information on the birth year of 
10:235:17770:28:28:72:536:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:deceased/former husbands, we subtracted three years from the female’s year of birth to generate 
10:236:17866:28:27:72:494:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a birth year for the deceased/former husband.5 For never-married females, the female is 
10:237:17954:27:28:72:531:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:designated as the head of the household and her year of birth is used to establish whether she is 
10:238:18052:28:27:72:234:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in the treatment or control group. 
10:239:18087:27:28:72:531:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Following previous research, we also restricted our sample to individuals in households 
10:240:18175:28:28:72:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in which the primary Social Security beneficiary was born between 1901 and 1930 (Krueger and

10:242:18358:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:research, we excluded 380 individuals in households that report Social Security income below 
10:243:18451:28:27:72:527:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:$100 per month (in 1993/1994 dollars) and 1,101 individuals with Social Security income that 
10:244:18544:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:was imputed.6,7 Thus, these restrictions, along with other observations lost to missing data and 
10:245:18641:28:27:71:541:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:non-zero sampling weights, resulted in a sample of 5,305 individuals from 4,136 households.  As 
10:246:18737:27:28:72:526:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:described below, we also follow prior research in splitting our sample by household education

10:254:19305:7:16:72:530:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:6 The vast majority of household with Social Security income under $100 per month reported zero Social Security

10:258:19650:11:0:72:416:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:depress our first-stage estimates of the effect of the notch on Social Security income.

11:262:19963:28:27:72:534:621:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:controls, and ε is the residual. Following earlier studies examining the notch (Moran and Simon 
11:263:20059:27:28:72:521:594:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006; Snyder and Evans 2006), we use Social Security income rather than total income.  The 
11:264:20150:28:27:72:540:566:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:notch is expected to be more important in predicting Social Security income because it may have 
11:265:20246:27:28:72:529:539:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:led to other offsetting behavioral changes which affected total income, as noted by Snyder and 
11:266:20341:28:28:72:399:511:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Evans (2006).  We come back to this issue at the end of Section III. 
11:267:20410:28:27:72:529:483:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: In this study, long-term care utilization U is represented by several measures.   We first 
11:268:20501:27:28:72:519:456:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:examine the use of any formal long-term care services (including nursing home use and paid

11:270:20682:27:28:72:537:401:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from the core 1995 AHEAD survey about nursing home use and paid home care use since 1993, 
11:271:20772:28:28:72:535:373:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:along with responses from the 1995 exit interview for those who died between 1993 and 1995.   
11:272:20866:28:27:72:510:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: We then consider different types of long-term care use separately to investigate the 
11:273:20951:27:28:72:530:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:composition of long-term care services and how they changed for those with a positive income 
11:274:21044:28:27:72:531:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shock.  First, we created an indicator for whether the individual had any nursing home use over 
11:275:21140:27:28:72:540:263:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the two-year period between the first and second AHEAD waves.  Next, we created a measure of 
11:276:21233:28:27:72:489:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:any home care service use based on whether any medically-trained person assisted the 
11:277:21318:27:28:72:313:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:respondent at home between the AHEAD waves.  
11:278:21363:28:28:108:541:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Using the first wave of the AHEAD, we create two additional measures of long-term care 
11:279:21450:28:27:72:539:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:use for a set of secondary analyses (reported in the appendix). We first create an indicator for the 
11:280:21551:27:28:72:538:125:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:receipt of any informal (unpaid) care related to ADL/IADL limitations over the four weeks prior 
11:281:21647:28:0:72:536:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to the survey.  We also measure paid home care during the 12 months prior to the 1993 survey.   
12:282:21745:0:27:108:540:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:A series of exogenous variables X at the household level were included as controls in this 
12:283:21836:27:28:71:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:study. In particular, we included indicators for the type of household (male head—married or 
12:284:21929:28:27:71:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohabitating; male head—single; female head—never-married; female head—widowed; and 
12:285:22013:27:28:71:527:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:female head—divorced), age of the head, race of the head (white, African American or other), 
12:286:22106:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Hispanic ethnicity of the head, whether the household is located in a metropolitan statistical area, 
12:287:22207:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and location (indicators for each of the nine census regions).  Similar to our coding of the birth 
12:288:22306:27:28:72:497:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohort variable, we define education based on the education of the household head.  For 
12:289:22394:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:households of widowed or divorced women, we use survey information on the schooling of their 
12:290:22487:27:28:72:520:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:former husbands to assign the household education level.  Other potential covariates, such as 
12:291:22581:28:28:72:508:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physical functioning, work status or Medicaid coverage, were excluded because they were 
12:292:22669:28:27:72:535:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:thought to be endogenous to Social Security income. As such, our estimates of β can be thought 
12:293:22764:27:28:72:525:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of as the total effect of a positive income shock on long-term care utilization, including all the 
12:294:22863:28:27:72:435:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:behavioral changes following a shift in permanent Social Security income.  
12:295:22938:27:28:108:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We first estimate equation 1 using a probit model. However, this approach may suffer 
12:296:23023:28:27:72:535:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from bias due to the suspected endogeneity of permanent income and long-term care utilization. 
12:297:23118:27:28:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:As noted in the introduction, the error term in equation 1 is likely to include unobserved health 
12:298:23216:28:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:status or preferences for independent living that may be correlated with Social Security income. 
12:299:23313:28:27:72:530:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:As such, we next estimate equation 1 using an instrumental variables probit estimator. Assume 
12:300:23407:27:29:72:374:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that Social Security income I has the following reduced form:

12:302:23502:31:28:71:516:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:where X is the same set of variables that appeared in the utilization equation, N is a variable 
12:303:23598:28:29:71:523:124:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:correlated with income but not the error term in the utilization equation, and  is the residual. 
12:304:23696:29:0:71:532:95:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Our instrument N is an indicator variable that takes on the value of “one” for households with a 
13:305:23795:0:27:72:517:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:primary Social Security beneficiary who was born during the notch years of 1915-17, and  a

13:307:23981:28:27:71:519:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 1930. Following previous researchers (e.g., Moran and Simon 2006), we used the period 
13:308:24071:27:28:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1915-1917 because these years represent the peak of the benefits notch (see Figure 1).8 Thus, the 
13:309:24169:28:28:72:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:identifying assumption is that the benefits notch N is correlated with I, Social Security income, 
13:310:24267:28:27:72:494:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but is not correlated with ε, the error term in the utilization equation. The quality of our 
13:311:24360:27:28:72:228:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:instrument is discussed below.   
13:312:24393:28:27:72:528:515:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: Given our use of a single cross-section for the majority of our analyses, presence in the

13:315:24672:28:27:72:533:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006) or by exploiting variation in age by year of birth (Krueger and Pischke 1992; Engelhardt, 
13:316:24768:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Gruber, and Perry 2005). The AHEAD is a relatively small sample and we do not know the exact 
13:317:24861:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:birth date to exploit variation in age by birth year. As such, we follow the approach of Moran and 
13:318:24960:27:28:71:497:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Simon (2006) by presenting results based on different specifications of the age variable. 
13:319:25050:28:27:71:527:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Specifically, we enter age as a polynomial function with the order ranging from one (linear) to 
13:320:25146:27:28:71:138:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:three (cubic).

13:322:25240:28:27:72:518:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:weights. We adjust our standard errors for clustering based on year of birth of the household 
13:323:25334:27:28:71:519:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:head.  All of our instrumental variables probit models are estimated using Stata’s ivprobit.do

14:332:26045:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Approximately 21 percent of the full sample received any long-term care services between the

14:334:26233:28:28:72:542:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home.  Overall, almost 9 percent received paid home care over the 12 months prior to the 
14:335:26330:28:27:72:504:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:survey, and 16 percent received paid home care between the first and second waves.  The 
14:336:26418:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:proportion of the sample receiving informal care over the past four weeks before the survey is 
14:337:26513:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:higher, roughly 23 percent.  The average annual Social Security income is $10,926 (in 1993 
14:338:26604:27:28:72:515:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dollars) but this figure is higher for the high education group than the low education group.  
14:339:26699:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Overall, 19 percent of the respondents were born in the notch years of 1915-1917.  The average

14:344:27049:28:27:108:518:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Problems with weak instruments are well-known (Staiger and Stock 1997; Stock and 
14:345:27130:27:28:72:508:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Yogo 2005) and Bound and colleagues (1995) have argued that the use of instruments that 
14:346:27218:28:28:72:529:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:jointly explain little of the variation in the endogenous variables can do more harm than good.  
14:347:27315:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Previous research using the Social Security benefits notch as exogenous variation in permanent 
14:348:27410:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income has shown that the notch is a much more powerful instrument for low-income relative to 
14:349:27504:28:27:72:508:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:high-income beneficiaries (Engelhardt, Gruber, and Perry 2005; Moran and Simon 2006).  
14:350:27591:27:28:108:521:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:This point can be illustrated by splitting the sample based on those households whose 
14:351:27677:28:28:72:531:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:heads have less than high school education and those heads have at least a high school diploma 
14:352:27772:28:0:72:520:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(see Table 2).  For the low education group, the instrument meets the standard of Staiger and 
15:353:27868:0:27:72:525:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Stock, with the F-statistics ranging from 14.02 to 23.75 depending on the specification. These 
15:354:27963:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates suggest that beneficiaries born during the peak notch years had between $1,149 and 
15:355:28056:28:27:72:497:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:$1,448 higher annual Social Security income in 1993 dollars. Relative to a mean annual 
15:356:28143:27:28:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:household Social Security income of $9,993 for this group, this suggests roughly an 11-14 
15:357:28233:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percent increase in permanent Social Security income for the notch cohorts. By comparison, the 
15:358:28328:28:27:72:513:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:high education group has a relatively low F-statistic (less than 1), and presence in the notch 
15:359:28423:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohort only increased household Social Security income by between $0 and $284 (2.4 percent). 
15:360:28516:28:27:72:506:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Given these results, we focus our analyses on only those households in which the primary 
15:361:28605:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:beneficiary has less than a high school education, resulting in 2,283 individuals in our sample. 
15:362:28702:28:28:108:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the assumption regarding the instruments being strongly associated with the 
15:363:28793:28:27:72:518:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:endogenous variable, there is also the requirement that the instrument must not be correlated 
15:364:28887:27:28:72:491:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with the error term in the second stage of IV estimation. If it is still correlated, then the 
15:365:28981:28:27:72:516:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:instrumented variable will still be endogenous. Although it is impossible to confirm the null 
15:366:29075:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis that these instruments are uncorrelated with the error term in the utilization equation, 
15:367:29175:28:27:72:517:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a standard practice within the literature is to report whether the instrument is correlated with 
15:368:29272:27:28:72:526:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:those observable factors believed to be correlated with the unobservable factors that affect the 
15:369:29369:28:28:72:513:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:second-stage error term. Thus, Table 3 divides the variables used within this study by those 
15:370:29462:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:observations that are in the notch cohort and those that are not. Table 3 presents the means for 
15:371:29559:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social Security income, explanatory and utilization measures across these two groups for the low 
15:372:29656:28:27:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:education subsample.  As expected, Social Security income is $1,452 higher for the notch cohort. 
15:373:29753:27:28:72:505:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The table shows that there are statistically significant differences across the two groups in 
15:374:29847:28:0:72:518:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home use and informal care use. Correcting for the difference in ages across the two 
16:375:29942:0:27:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:groups, we find that the samples are more balanced.9  We also perform robustness checks using a 
16:376:30038:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:more extensive set of health controls to account for any health differences among the two groups 
16:377:30135:28:27:72:445:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not captured by age and other control variables (described in section IV.B.).   
16:378:30215:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: We also separately investigate the effect of the notch on non-Social Security income to 
16:379:30303:28:28:72:495:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:aid the interpretation of our results.  If a positive shock in Social Security income led to 
16:380:30396:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:offsetting behavioral responses on other sources of income, our results would have to be scaled 
16:381:30492:27:28:71:521:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:appropriately in order to be interpreted as shocks in total income.  Moreover, if the offsetting 
16:382:30589:28:27:71:515:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:response was large enough that it left total income unchanged, we would not expect to see a 
16:383:30681:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:response of long-term care utilization to positive Social Security income shocks.  We find that 
16:384:30777:28:28:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts born during the Benefits notch have slightly lower levels of non-Social Security income; 
16:385:30874:28:27:71:536:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:however, the magnitude of the effect is small and the relationship is not statistically significant.  
16:386:30976:27:28:71:521:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This result, namely that notch cohorts did not have detectable changes in non-Social Security 
16:387:31070:28:27:72:523:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income, is not surprising given the importance of Social Security income to individuals in the 
16:388:31165:27:28:72:496:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:low-education subsample:  on average, Social Security income is 68 percent of the total 
16:389:31253:28:27:72:529:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:household income for these respondents.  In addition, these results are consistent with Krueger 
16:390:31349:27:28:71:525:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Pischke (1992) which point to a negligible labor supply response to rising Social Security

17:401:32072:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:results are dramatically different across these two sets of models. Across all our outcomes, the 
17:402:32169:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:probit findings suggest a negative correlation between (endogenous) Social Security income and 
17:403:32264:27:28:72:525:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long-term care use, which is consistent with the idea that poorer health is correlated with both

17:405:32419:28:27:108:515:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We first examine the effect of positive Social Security income shocks on any formal

17:407:32593:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:variable, we find a statistically significant negative correlation between Social Security income 
17:408:32691:27:28:72:509:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and any formal long-term care use.  However, once we instrument for income, we obtain a 
17:409:32779:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:positive point estimate of the effect of Social Security income on formal long-term care use on 
17:410:32875:28:27:72:510:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the order of 5 percent of formal long-term care utilization, but this effect is not statistically

17:414:33159:28:27:72:527:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:investigate the effects of different types of care separately.  Treating income as exogenous, we 
17:415:33256:27:28:71:526:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:find a statistically significant negative effect of Social Security income on any paid home care

17:417:33445:28:27:71:531:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:we obtain a statistically significant positive effect of Social Security income on paid home care

18:429:34527:28:28:72:513:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentage points (or 24-34% of the mean).  These results, combined with those in Table 5, 
18:430:34618:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:indicate that while positive Social Security income shocks appear to have a weak positive effect 
18:431:34715:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on overall formal long-term care utilization, they have opposite effects on nursing home and 
18:432:34808:28:27:72:154:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:home care use.11 
18:433:34824:27:28:108:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:All of the above results evaluate long-term care utilization along the extensive margin 
18:434:34912:28:28:71:541:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(whether the individual used any long-term care), but utilization along the intensive margin (how 
18:435:35010:28:27:71:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:much care the individual used) may also be important. In order to assess this issue, we ran two-

18:437:35204:28:27:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income on number of nursing home days between waves 1 and 2 of the AHEAD.12  The results 
18:438:35293:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for all these models are available in the Appendix and were generally consistent with the results 
18:439:35391:28:27:72:539:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reported above in sign and suggested that an additional $1000 in Social Security income reduced 
18:440:35487:27:28:72:437:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:stays in nursing home by 4.3-5.7 days, but they lacked statistical precision.

18:442:35587:28:27:108:537:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Though we exclude covariates that are potentially endogenous to Social Security income 
18:443:35674:27:23:72:542:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:such as Medicaid eligibility and health status variables (i.e., number of ADLs; number of IADLs;

18:445:35819:7:16:72:540:182:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:11 When we analyzed informal care, the probit model indicates a negative and statistically significant effect of Social 
18:446:35939:16:12:71:527:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Security income on the likelihood of informal care use (see Table A1). However, once we instrument for income, 
18:447:36050:12:11:71:537:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:this result falls away in the quadratic age specification, and we obtain a positive effect of Social Security income on 
18:448:36170:11:12:71:521:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:informal care utilization, although this result is not statistically meaningful. Taken with the linear and cubic age 
18:449:36287:12:11:71:510:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:specification results, we cannot conclude that there is a causal effect of Social Security income shocks on the 
18:450:36399:11:12:71:519:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:likelihood of informal care use. However, a limitation is that we can only measure informal care by any unpaid 
18:451:36510:12:11:71:326:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:assistance for an ADL or IADL over the previous four weeks.

18:453:36572:7:16:72:535:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:12 The AHEAD did not ask about the amount of paid home care used after the baseline interview among decedents, 
18:454:36683:16:0:72:341:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:precluding us from estimating the analogous model for home care.

19:456:36850:27:28:72:531:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:problems), we perform robustness checks including these covariates and find that the signs and 
19:457:36945:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:magnitudes of the coefficients and marginal effects are very similar.  The results are also robust 
19:458:37044:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to eliminating spouses from the analysis and performing the analysis without the weights from 
19:459:37138:28:28:72:525:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the HRS.  Finally, our results are robust to including interactions between household structure 
19:460:37234:28:27:72:368:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and age and dropping non-white and Hispanic observations.   
19:461:37294:27:28:108:511:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, we perform robustness checks to various sample restrictions, following 
19:462:37378:28:27:72:521:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Moran and Simon (2006).  For instance, our method of imputing birth year for the household 
19:463:37469:27:28:72:515:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:head of widowed and divorced women may introduce measurement error into our analysis.  
19:464:37556:28:28:72:526:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Excluding these two groups provides results that are similar to those reported here, though the 
19:465:37652:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:magnitude of the home care utilization effects are smaller and no longer statistically significant.  
19:466:37753:27:28:72:514:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Our results are also not sensitive to whether we conduct our analyses at the household level 
19:467:37846:28:27:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(available upon request), where the dependent variables correspond to whether anyone in the 
19:468:37938:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:household used long-term care services (similar to Moran and Simon (2006)).  We also examine 
19:469:38031:28:27:72:538:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the sensitivity of our results to the specific birth cohorts included in our study.  First, we exclude 
19:470:38134:27:28:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cohorts born during the flu pandemic in 1918 and 1919.  Next, we limit the range of the cohorts 
19:471:38230:28:28:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:included in the study to those born between 1910 and 1920 due to possible cohort effects in long-
19:472:38327:28:27:72:525:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:term care utilization for reasons unrelated to differences in permanent income stemming from 
19:473:38420:27:28:72:521:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes in Social Security legislation.  In both of these cases, we find results (available upon 
19:474:38517:28:27:72:510:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:request) that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to our base results. Finally, we test 
19:475:38614:27:28:72:518:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whether our results are robust to the choice of functional form for Social Security income by 
19:476:38708:28:0:72:509:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimating our models using logged Social Security income.  These results (available upon 
20:477:38800:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:request) are also qualitatively similar to our base results and are estimated with even more

20:481:38942:28:28:108:526:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Our results indicate that a positive Social Security income shock would lead seniors to 
20:482:39030:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase their utilization of home care services, and reduce nursing home stays.  In this section, 
20:483:39129:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:we briefly explore several mechanisms which may underlie these findings.  One hypothesis is 
20:484:39221:28:27:72:521:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that increased Social Security income leads to substitution away from nursing home care and 
20:485:39313:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:towards home care use.  Another pathway that may lead to the results we observe is improved 
20:486:39405:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health.  That is, an increase in Social Security income will lead to better health which ultimately 
20:487:39505:28:27:72:537:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decreases the need for nursing home care.  A third explanation relates to Medicaid:  more Social 
20:488:39602:27:28:72:496:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Security income could lead to less reliance on Medicaid and therefore more home care.  
20:489:39689:28:27:72:541:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid is a means-tested program that requires individuals to meet income and asset eligibility 
20:490:39787:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:standards in order to qualify for coverage. During our period of study, Medicaid coverage was 
20:491:39881:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fairly biased in favor of institutional nursing home coverage. We visit each of these hypotheses 
20:492:39978:27:28:72:110:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in turn. 
20:493:39987:28:28:72:267:267:144:Times:144:Times:C:A.  Substitution between Types of Care 
20:494:40026:28:27:72:530:239:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: The results in the previous section suggest that a positive Social Security income shock 
20:495:40115:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decreases nursing home use but increases home care use.  However, the estimates do not clearly 
20:496:40210:28:27:72:527:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:indicate whether individuals substitute home care for nursing home care or whether those who 
20:497:40303:27:28:72:507:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would not have received long-term care are more likely to use home care.  To address this 
20:498:40393:28:28:72:515:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:question, we categorize individuals into one of four categories:  no long-term care use, only 
20:499:40487:28:0:72:539:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:home care use, only nursing home use, and both home care and nursing home care use.  We then 
21:500:40582:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:perform a multinomial logit regression while accounting for the endogeneity of Social Security 
21:501:40677:27:28:72:385:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income using the 2SRI method (Terza, Basu and Rathouz 2008). 
21:502:40738:28:27:72:535:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Table 7 summarizes our results.  We report both the estimated coefficients as well as the 
21:503:40828:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:marginal effects of an additional $1,000 of Social Security income on the predicted probabilities 
21:504:40926:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of being in each category, where no long-term care use is the base category.  The results provide 
21:505:41024:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:some support for the hypothesis that the increase in the use of home care due to higher Social 
21:506:41119:27:28:71:517:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Security income was a result of individuals substituting away from nursing home care.   The 
21:507:41211:28:27:71:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimated marginal effect for choosing home care use and no nursing home care use from an 
21:508:41301:27:28:71:499:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase in $1,000 in annual household Social Security income varies from a 3.1 to a 3.5 
21:509:41390:28:28:71:532:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentage point increase, while the marginal effect for choosing nursing home care use and no 
21:510:41485:28:27:71:521:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:home care use varies from a 0.6 to 0.7 percentage point decrease.  The marginal effect on the 
21:511:41579:27:28:71:510:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:predicted probability of using no long-term care varies from a 2.6 to a 2.9 percentage point 
21:512:41672:28:27:71:532:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decrease, while the marginal effects on using both nursing home and home care are negligible.  
21:513:41767:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Overall, the results suggest that while higher Social Security income does cause some individuals 
21:514:41865:28:27:71:534:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to use home care who would not have otherwise received long-term care, it does also lead some 
21:515:41959:27:28:71:364:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individuals to substitute home care for nursing home care.13  
21:516:42021:28:28:108:522:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:These results provide suggestive evidence that higher Social Security income reduces 
21:517:42106:28:27:72:540:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand for nursing home care when home care is an available substitute.  These results, together 
21:518:42203:27:28:72:504:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with the finding from Engelhardt and colleagues (2005) that greater income increased the 
21:519:42292:28:64:72:477:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood of elderly individuals living alone, are consistent with the idea that living 
21:520:42381:64:7:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
21:521:42429:7:16:72:532:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:13 Note the drop in sample size in Table 7 is due to skip patterns in the HRS that led to current residents of nursing 
21:522:42548:16:12:71:536:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:home not being asked questions about home care use.  We perform robustness checks that include these individuals 
21:523:42661:12:11:71:527:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:in either the “nursing home only” category and the “nursing home plus home care” category and get qualitatively 
21:524:42773:11:0:71:132:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:similar results. 
22:525:42792:0:27:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:independently is a valued good.  Given the preference for care in the least restrictive setting 
22:526:42888:27:28:72:308:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:possible, we find this hypothesis quite plausible.

22:529:42975:28:28:108:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:An alternate pathway of income leading to increased home care use and reduced nursing 
22:530:43061:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:home use might be through improved health. That is, an increase in Social Security income could 
22:531:43157:27:28:72:497:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lead to better health and a less severe need for long-term care which may be more easily

22:533:43339:27:28:72:513:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:plausible due to the evidence of the causal link between income or wealth and health which 
22:534:43430:28:28:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggests modest effects (e.g., Meer, Miller, and Rosen 2003; Lindahl 2005; Adda, Banks, and 
22:535:43522:28:27:72:496:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:von Gaudecker 2009), or even negative effects (Snyder and Evans 2006).  However, we 
22:536:43606:27:28:72:504:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:investigate this hypothesis by examining whether positive income shocks from the Social 
22:537:43694:28:27:72:528:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Security notch led to improvements in self-reported health status or declines in the presence of 
22:538:43791:27:28:72:189:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ADL/IADL limitations. 
22:539:43813:28:27:108:533:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Table 8 reports our results.  Although higher Social Security income is correlated with a 
22:540:43903:27:28:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lower probability of disability in the probit results, positive Social Security income shocks have 
22:541:44002:28:28:72:526:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:no clear statistically powerful effects on either ADL or IADL limitations.  The same pattern is 
22:542:44098:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:visible in self-reported health status.  Moreover, the direction of the results is generally opposite 
22:543:44200:27:28:72:533:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the intuition that higher income would improve health outcomes.  These results, combined with 
22:544:44294:28:27:72:502:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our earlier finding that our estimates were insensitive to including extensive health status 
22:545:44387:27:28:72:540:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:covariates, make it unlikely that the results we see in the Section IV were due to improved health 
22:546:44486:28:28:72:176:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:or reduced disability.

23:548:44561:0:27:108:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we acknowledge the possibility that our results may work through Medicaid in 
23:549:44647:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that more income will lead to less reliance on Medicaid and therefore result in more home care. 
23:550:44743:28:27:72:512:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Although state Medicaid programs have increased their coverage of home- and community-
23:551:44829:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:based services in recent years, the coverage of these services was relatively minimal during our 
23:552:44926:28:28:72:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:study period. Thus, the strong institutional bias in the Medicaid benefit during the early-to-mid 
23:553:45024:28:27:72:520:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1990s may be part of the explanation for how greater income led to less nursing home care.   
23:554:45117:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, given that the majority of states have a “medically needy” program with no restrictions 
23:555:45214:28:27:72:520:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on income for eligibility, we believe this explanation is less likely because assets, rather than 
23:556:45312:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income, generally present the biggest barrier to Medicaid eligibility (Norton 1995).  In models 
23:557:45408:28:28:72:518:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:where Medicaid enrollment was the dependent variable, we found no statistically significant 
23:558:45500:28:27:72:530:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effect of the notch.14  Combined with our robustness checks that included Medicaid enrollment 
23:559:45594:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in our models which did not alter our main results on long-term care utilization, we conclude that 
23:560:45693:28:27:71:512:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid eligibility is unlikely to be an important mechanism for explaining our findings.

23:563:45815:27:28:71:534:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: In order to examine the effects of a change in Social Security benefits on long-term care 
23:564:45905:28:28:71:528:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:utilization, we first convert our preferred coefficient estimates from Table 5 and Table 6 of the

23:568:46280:27:28:72:517:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our estimates suggest that a $1,000 increase in annual household Social Security benefits (in

24:574:46692:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:term care system have changed since the early waves of the AHEAD survey, our results suggest 
24:575:46785:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that a moderate change in annual retirement income would still have important effects on long-
24:576:46879:27:28:72:175:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:term care utilization. 
24:577:46902:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:  A key issue is the plausibility of the magnitude of these estimates. For comparison, Van 
24:578:46992:28:27:72:521:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Houtven and Norton (2004) find that a 10 percent increase in hours of informal care lead to a 
24:579:47086:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:0.77 percentage point reduction in the probability of home care use and a 0.83 percentage point 
24:580:47182:28:27:72:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in the probability of nursing home use after taking into account the endogeneity of 
24:581:47276:27:28:72:518:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:informal caregiving.  However, a key point in interpreting our estimates is that the $1,000 in 
24:582:47371:28:28:72:514:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:additional Social Security income is an annual amount. Using our first stage estimates from 
24:583:47463:28:27:71:542:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Table 2 coupled with Social Security data, we can calculate the present discounted value of being 
24:584:47561:27:28:72:534:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in the notch cohort for an individual at age 65. The annuity value for a 65 year old born in 1916 
24:585:47659:28:27:72:523:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is 10.91 for males and 13.33 for females.16   Thus, a $1,200 annual increase (from Table 2) in 
24:586:47754:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social Security income amounts to a $13,092 lump sum for men and a $15,996 lump sum for 
24:587:47842:28:27:72:517:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:women.  Because Social Security pays 100% of the primary earner's benefit to the surviving 
24:588:47933:27:28:72:512:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:spouse, the correct annuity value is a joint, second-to-die annuity that pays until the second 
24:589:48028:28:28:71:516:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:death.  Thus, $16,000 is a good estimate of the present discounted value for a 65-year old of 
24:590:48122:28:27:71:522:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:being in the notch cohort. As a benchmark, the average present discounted value of projected 
24:591:48215:27:28:71:503:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lifetime out-of-pocket long-term care expenditures for individuals turning 65 in 2005 was

24:593:48401:27:28:71:527:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:context, the magnitude of our estimates of the effect of income on long-term care utilization is 
24:594:48498:28:32:71:147:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:quite plausible.

25:600:48748:28:27:108:517:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:This study exploits an arguably exogenous change in income that led retirees born in 
25:601:48833:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:different years to receive significantly different amounts of income to determine the effect of 
25:602:48929:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income on long-term care utilization and its composition.  Our results indicate that while overall 
25:603:49028:28:27:72:516:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:formal long-term care use is only weakly higher, a positive shock in Social Security income 
25:604:49120:27:28:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would lead seniors to significantly increase their utilization of home care services and reduce 
25:605:49216:28:27:72:503:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home stays.  We explore several mechanisms which may underlie these findings, 
25:606:49302:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:including substitution from nursing home care to home care, changes in health, and changes in 
25:607:49396:28:28:72:524:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Medicaid eligibility.  Our findings suggest that the most likely explanation for these effects is 
25:608:49494:28:27:72:516:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that independence is a valued good which leads elderly individuals to choose less restrictive 
25:609:49588:27:28:72:406:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:settings for long-term care services when afforded by higher income. 
25:610:49657:28:27:72:541:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: An important caveat is that our results pertain only to low-wage workers. Due to the 1977 
25:611:49747:27:28:72:530:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:law raising the covered earnings maximum, the notch is relatively weak for high wage workers 
25:612:49840:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:when using a wider set of birth cohorts (1900-1930). Unfortunately, the AHEAD survey does not 
25:613:49934:27:28:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have large enough sample directly around the notch to isolate the effect of the notch for high-
25:614:50029:28:28:72:510:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:wage workers. Presumably, a different set of mechanisms may be important for high-wage 
25:615:50116:28:27:72:510:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:earners such as the role of private long-term care insurance.  Future research using a larger 
25:616:50210:27:28:72:495:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sample may also investigate whether the effects we observe are heterogenous by family 
25:617:50296:28:27:72:530:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:structure.  Engelhardt and colleagues (2005) found that the effect of Social Security income on 
25:618:50392:27:28:72:530:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:independent living was strongest among unmarried households, and it is thus plausible that our 
25:619:50487:28:0:72:478:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:results on long-term care utilization may be strongest among unmarried households. 
26:620:50572:0:27:72:505:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: In addition, data limitations prohibit our analysis from disentangling the effects of 
26:621:50658:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income on long-term care from post-acute rehabilitative care.  Because a positive income shock 
26:622:50753:28:27:72:530:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may have different effects on post-acute care (which is often covered by Medicare), examining 
26:623:50847:27:28:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:claims data is a fruitful area for future research.  Such data could also estimate the effects of 
26:624:50945:28:28:72:508:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:income on payer-specific expenditures on long-term care, an important public policy issue 
26:625:51035:28:27:72:529:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:because of the major role of Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, Medicare, in financing long-term 
26:626:51131:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:care.  Finally, future research may investigate whether more income also leads to more use of 
26:627:51225:28:27:72:512:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assisted-living services which allow for greater independence than nursing homes and have 
26:628:51315:27:28:72:326:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:grown in prominence since the period that we study. 
26:629:51367:28:28:72:535:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Nevertheless, we have found an important effect of income on long-term care utilization 
26:630:51455:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for low wage workers. These findings suggest that Social Security benefit cuts could have a large 
26:631:51553:27:28:72:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact of the utilization of long-term care services, leading more individuals to stay in nursing
