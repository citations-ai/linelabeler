2:30:1669:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:This   paper   describes   the   optimal   level   of   government   purchases   in   the   presence   of 
2:31:1775:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment. The  theoretical  framework  is  a  general-equilibrium  matching  model  in  which 
2:32:1872:14:14:71:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:government  purchases are  valuable.  When  the  unemployment  gap  is  zero,  the  conventional 
2:33:1968:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:Samuelson   formula   is   valid.   Otherwise, optimal   government   spending   deviates   from   the 
2:34:2070:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:Samuelson  level  to  fill  the  unemployment  gap  partially. Hence,  with  a  positive  unemployment 
2:35:2172:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:multiplier   (so   that   increasing   government   purchases   reduces unemployment),   government 
2:36:2271:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:spending should be higher than the Samuelson level when unemployment is inefficiently high and 
2:37:2365:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:lower  when  unemployment  is  inefficiently  low.  We  characterize  the  optimal level  of  stimulus 
2:38:2467:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:spending.  We  find  that  stimulus  spending  is  largest  for  a  moderate  unemployment multiplier. 
2:39:2569:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:With larger multipliers, stimulus spending is smaller because less spending is required to fill the 
2:40:2668:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment gap. With smaller multipliers, stimulus spending is smaller because there is more 
2:41:2762:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:crowding  out  of  private  spending  by  public  spending.  We  also  find  that  stimulus  spending 
2:42:2864:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:increases with the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption. With a zero 
2:43:2961:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:elasticity (so that additional public workers dig and fill holes), stimulus spending is zero. With an 
2:44:3062:14:14:71:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:infinite elasticity (so that private and public workers are perfect substitute), stimulus spending is 
2:45:3163:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:large enough to fill the unemployment gap completely. Finally, the results hold whether taxes are 
2:46:3260:14:42:71:231:364:12:Times:12:Times:nondistortionary or distortionary.

3:59:3551:0:34:254:357:701:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1.  Introduction
3:60:3567:34:22:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:At the onset of the Great Recession governments responded to rising unemployment rates as they
3:61:3661:22:21:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:always  do:  by  lowering  interest  rates.   But  the  zero  lower  bound  on  the  nominal  interest  rate
3:62:3769:21:22:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rapidly became an issue, prompting governments to look for alternative stabilization policies. One
3:63:3867:22:22:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:policy that had been used before and was considered again, was adjusting government purchases.
3:64:3961:22:21:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:However, as most modern research on stabilization had focused on monetary policy, policymakers
3:65:4055:21:22:72:365:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:had to base their decisions on fragmentary theoretical results.
3:66:4118:22:22:89:539:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this paper we revisit and expand existing results on the optimal use of government purchases
3:67:4213:22:21:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for stabilization.  The theoretical framework is a general-equilibrium matching model.1Govern-
3:68:4307:21:22:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment purchases are valuable and financed by taxes that keep the government budget balanced. We
3:69:4401:22:22:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:formulate the optimal policy with three sufficient statistics:  (1) the unemployment gap, which is
3:70:4499:22:21:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the difference between the current unemployment rate and the efficient unemployment rate;  (2)
3:71:4593:21:22:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment multiplier, which measures the reduction in unemployment rate caused by an
3:72:4684:22:22:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increase in public consumption; and (3) the elasticity of substitution between public and private
3:73:4781:22:21:72:431:385:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:consumption, which describes the value of additional public consumption.2
3:74:4854:21:22:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our  starting  point  is  the  standard  public-economics  result  that  when  productive  efficiency
3:75:4955:22:22:71:539:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:holds, public goods should be provided to the point where the marginal rate of substitution between
3:76:5054:22:21:71:540:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public and private consumption equals the marginal rate of transformation (Samuelson 1954).3The
3:77:5149:21:22:71:494:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Samuelson formula remains valid in our model when the unemployment rate is efficient.
3:78:5234:22:22:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:However, when unemployment is inefficiently high, productive efficiency fails and the Samuel-
3:79:5327:22:21:71:539:255:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:son formula does not apply.   Macroeconomics offers a basic insight for these situations:  if the
3:80:5424:21:22:71:539:234:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output multiplier (the effect on output of an increase in government purchases) is larger than one,
3:81:5523:22:22:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government spending should increase.  The logic is simple.  With a multiplier above one, higher
3:82:5618:22:21:71:539:190:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government spending leads not only to higher public consumption but also to higher private con-
3:83:5713:21:19:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sumption, so it is desirable.  During the Great Recession, this logic lead to a spurt of empirical

4:90:6357:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:research to determine whether the output multiplier was above or below one.  But the logic is in-
4:91:6454:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:complete. If more public spending yields more public consumption and more private consumption,
4:92:6548:22:21:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public spending should increase forevermore, or until the multiplier falls below one.4Assuming
4:93:6642:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that the multiplier becomes less than one at some point, a key question remains: now that there is
4:94:6740:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a tradeoff between public and private consumption, what should the government do?  This is also
4:95:6835:22:21:72:340:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the question if the multiplier is below one to begin with.
4:96:6893:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To address this question,Mankiw and Weinzierl(2011) use a disequilibrium model. They find
4:97:6982:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that government purchases should be above the Samuelson level to completely fill the output gap.
4:98:7078:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:However, the disequilibrium model is special.  Its output multiplier is exactly one, so an increase
4:99:7177:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in government activity does not affect private activity. There is no crowding out of private activity
4:100:7278:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by government spending when government spending rises and no shift of resources back to private
4:101:7373:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:activity when government spending falls. This property has strong implications. For example, the
4:102:7469:21:22:72:485:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:social value of public spending is irrelevant for the optimal level of stimulus spending.
4:103:7558:22:22:89:539:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Using a matching model allows us to analyze optimal government spending when unemploy-
4:104:7644:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment is inefficiently high and there is an actual tradeoff between public and private consumption.
4:105:7742:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The tradeoff exists because public consumption crowds out private consumption.  When the gov-
4:106:7835:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ernment increases its purchases, it increases the length of the queues to purchase goods and services
4:107:7936:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and thus discourages household purchases, generating crowding out. The amount of crowding out
4:108:8029:21:22:72:344:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:may vary with the unemployment rate (Michaillat 2014).
4:109:8083:22:22:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find that when the unemployment rate is inefficiently high or low, government purchases
4:110:8173:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should deviate from the Samuelson level to partially fill the unemployment gap.   Hence,  when
4:111:8267:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment multiplier is positive—such that an increase in government purchases reduces
4:112:8360:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment rate—optimal public spending is above the Samuelson level whenever unem-
4:113:8449:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ployment is inefficiently high.   To understand the result,  imagine that public consumption is at
4:114:8547:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the Samuelson level, the unemployment multiplier is positive, and unemployment is inefficiently
4:115:8642:21:19:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:high.  Keeping total consumption constant, increasing public consumption by 1 unit reduces pri-
4:116:8737:19:15:85:539:147:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:4Robert Barro has made this point: “If the multiplier is greater than one, as is apparently assumed by Team Obama,
4:117:8851:15:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the process is even more wonderful. In this case, real GDP rises by more than the increase in government purchases.
4:118:8966:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Thus, in addition to the free airplane or bridge, we also have more goods and services left over to raise private consump-
4:119:9088:12:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:tion or investment. In this scenario, the added government spending is a good idea even if the bridge goes to nowhere,
4:120:9206:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:or if public employees are just filling useless holes.  Of course, if this mechanism is genuine, one might ask why the
4:121:9324:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:government should stop with only $1 trillion of added purchases.” See Robert J. Barro, “Government Spending Is No

5:123:9547:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:vate consumption by 1 unit.  At the Samuelson level, the marginal utilities of public and private
5:124:9644:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption are equalized.  Hence, the increase in public consumption has no first-order effect
5:125:9739:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on welfare so far.  Since the unemployment multiplier is positive, increasing public consumption
5:126:9835:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lowers unemployment.  Since unemployment is inefficiently high, reducing unemployment raises
5:127:9927:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:total consumption.  Now the increase in public consumption has a positive effect on welfare: it is
5:128:10025:22:21:72:275:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:therefore optimal to raise public spending.
5:129:10068:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Next, we study how much of the unemployment gap should be filled, and how much stimulus
5:130:10155:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending—the deviation of government spending from the Samuelson level—is required to achieve
5:131:10248:22:21:72:174:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this desired outcome.
5:132:10269:21:22:89:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:First, we examine how the optimal level of stimulus spending depends on the size of the unem-
5:133:10362:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ployment multiplier. Nakamura and Steinsson (2014, pp.787–788) consider this question in a New
5:134:10456:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Keynesian model. They obtain a formula that implicitly characterizes optimal government spend-
5:135:10550:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing, and they infer that stimulus spending should be larger when the multiplier is larger. However,
5:136:10649:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this bang-for-the-buck logic is incomplete because it omits the response of output to government
5:137:10745:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending in the implicit formula. To address this typical limitation of implicit formulas, we develop
5:138:10846:21:22:72:517:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:an explicit formula that describes optimal stimulus spending as a function of fixed quantities.
5:139:10941:22:22:89:539:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our explicit formula shows that the optimal level of stimulus spending is increasing in the
5:140:11032:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier for small multipliers, is maximized for a moderate multiplier, and is decreasing in the
5:141:11130:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier for large multipliers.  When the unemployment multiplier is small, the response of un-
5:142:11227:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:employment to public spending is small, so the bang-for-the-buck logic holds. However, when the
5:143:11322:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier becomes large, the response of unemployment to public spending becomes important
5:144:11413:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the logic breaks down. As the multiplier becomes large, crowding out of private consumption
5:145:11508:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by public consumption becomes small, and optimal stimulus spending fills the unemployment gap
5:146:11601:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nearly entirely.  As less spending is required to fill the unemployment gap when the multiplier is
5:147:11699:22:21:72:435:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:larger, the optimal level of stimulus spending is decreasing in the multiplier.
5:148:11778:21:22:89:539:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Then, we examine how the optimal level of stimulus spending depends on the usefulness of ad-
5:149:11870:22:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ditional public spending. We find that both the optimal level of stimulus spending and the fraction
5:150:11969:22:21:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the unemployment gap that should be filled are increasing in the elasticity of substitution be-
5:151:12067:21:22:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tween public and private consumption. There are two interesting limit cases. With a zero elasticity
5:152:12166:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of substitution—new public workers dig and fill holes—public consumption beyond the Samuel-
6:153:12258:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:son level is useless. Since public consumption crowds out private consumption, it is never optimal
6:154:12356:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to provide public consumption beyond the Samuelson level.   With an infinite elasticity of sub-
6:155:12451:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stitution, public and private consumption are interchangeable, so it is optimal to maximize total
6:156:12548:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption, irrespective of its composition.  Accordingly, it is optimal to fill the unemployment
6:157:12646:22:22:72:148:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gap completely.
6:158:12661:22:21:89:539:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, we examine how taxation affects the results.  The results are initially derived with a
6:159:12756:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fixed labor supply, and thus nondistortionary taxes.  But a prevalent concern is that when govern-
6:160:12854:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment purchases are financed by distortionary taxes, the output multiplier could be negative as a
6:161:12950:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:result of the fall in labor supply caused by tax distortions, thus overturning the benefits of stimu-
6:162:13051:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lus spending in slumps.  In fact, empirical evidence for the United States suggests that the output
6:163:13150:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier is negative once tax distortions are taken into account (Barro and Redlick 2011).  We
6:164:13246:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:therefore introduce endogenous labor supply and distortionary taxation. We find that all the results
6:165:13346:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:carry over.  We also find that the unemployment multiplier equals the output multiplier net of the
6:166:13444:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:labor-supply response due to distortionary taxation.  Since the labor-supply response is negative,
6:167:13542:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment multiplier is larger than the output multiplier.  With a strong negative labor-
6:168:13638:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:supply response, a negative output multiplier can coexist with a positive unemployment multiplier.
6:169:13736:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Hence, we cannot use the sign of the output multiplier to infer the sign of the unemployment mul-
6:170:13833:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tiplier and determine whether stimulus spending is desirable in slumps.   In fact,  a reduction in
6:171:13931:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:labor supply leads to lower output but higher tightness and lower unemployment in the matching
6:172:14025:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model (Michaillat and Saez 2015). Therefore, the unemployment multiplier is larger once tax dis-
6:173:14121:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tortions are taken into account. This implies that if stimulus spending is desirable in slumps under
6:174:14221:21:22:72:423:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nondistortionary taxation, it is also desirable under distortionary taxation.
6:175:14298:22:22:89:539:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this paper we limit ourselves to static considerations and skirt around dynamic considera-
6:176:14391:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tions.5However, to gain a more complete understanding of how public spending can be used for
6:177:14483:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stabilization, it would be useful to enrich our static analysis with dynamic elements.  Several dy-
6:178:14582:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:namic elements seem important: the intertemporal smoothing of distortionary taxes and the use of
6:179:14678:22:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:debt, as in Barro (1979); the distinction between temporary and permanent changes in government
6:180:14773:18:16:85:539:126:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:5In the data the transitional dynamics of unemployment are extremely fast and inflation displays a large amount of
6:181:14887:16:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:inertia. Given these observations, we opt to abstract from the transitional dynamics of unemployment and from price
6:182:15002:12:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:dynamics. As a result, our dynamic model immediately converges to steady state from any initial condition. Thus, the
6:183:15118:12:0:72:323:86:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:analysis is essentially static even though the model is dynamic.
7:184:15183:0:22:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending, as in Barro(1981); the dynamic response of inflation to public spending, especially in
7:185:15279:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a liquidity trap,  as inWoodford(2011) andWerning(2012);  government investment on infras-
7:186:15369:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tructure projects, as inBaxter and King(1993); and the political process leading to the design of
7:187:15466:21:45:72:326:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stimulus packages, as inBattaglini and Coate(2016).

7:189:15578:34:22:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This section presents the matching model used for the analysis of optimal government purchases.
7:190:15673:22:21:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The model is dynamic and set in continuous time. There are two goods: private services, purchased
7:191:15770:21:22:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by households, and public services, purchased by the government. Government purchases are valu-
7:192:15865:22:22:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:able to households, as inSamuelson(1954). Government purchases contribute to macroeconomic
7:193:15955:22:21:72:313:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stabilization by influencing the aggregate demand.
7:194:16005:21:22:89:539:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The supply structure of the model is borrowed fromMichaillat and Saez(2015).  Services are
7:195:16095:22:22:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:produced by self-employed households and traded on a matching market.  Not all the available
7:196:16187:22:21:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services are sold at any point in time, so there is always some unemployment. Whereas the supply
7:197:16283:21:22:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:structure is specific,  the demand structure and price mechanism are generic.   FollowingChetty
7:198:16378:22:22:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2006,2008),  we will express the formula with sufficient statistics that summarize the relevant
7:199:16474:22:43:72:334:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:features of the demand structure and price mechanism.
7:200:16527:43:30:72:228:304:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:2.1.    The Supply Structure
7:201:16555:30:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The economy consists of a government and a measure 1 of identical households.  Households are
7:202:16648:21:22:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:self-employed,  producing  and selling  services  on a  matching  market.6There  are two  types  of
7:203:16747:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services:  private services and public services.  Public and private services are produced using the
7:204:16847:22:21:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:same technology.   The government purchases public services and households purchases private
7:205:16939:21:22:72:397:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services. All services are sold on the same market at the same price.
7:206:17008:22:22:89:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Each household has a fixed productive capacityk; the productive capacity indicates the max-
7:207:17099:22:21:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:imum amount of services that a household could sell at any point in time.  Households sellC(t)
7:208:17193:21:19:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services to other households andG(t)services to the government.  The output of services is the
7:209:17287:19:16:85:539:104:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:6We assume that households cannot consume their own labor services. For simplicity, we abstract from firms and
7:210:17397:16:12:72:539:88:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:assume that all production directly takes place within households.Michaillat and Saez(2015) show how the model
7:211:17507:12:0:72:531:76:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:can be modified to include firms hiring workers on a labor market and selling their production on a product market.
8:212:17623:0:40:72:341:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sum of household purchases and government purchases:
8:213:17675:40:40:258:352:668:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f7:Y(t) =C(t)+G(t).
8:214:17691:40:21:72:496:628:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The matching process prevents households from selling their entire capacity soY(t)<k.
8:215:17776:21:22:89:540:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The services are sold through long-term relationships. The relationships separate at rates>0.
8:216:17869:22:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:SinceY(t)services are committed to existing relationships, households’ idle capacity isk−Y(t).
8:217:17963:22:21:72:515:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The unemployment rate is the share of households’ capacity that is idle:u(t) = (k−Y(t))/k.

8:219:18143:22:40:72:519:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which new long-term relationships are formed is given by a Cobb-Douglas matching function
8:220:18232:40:39:230:381:480:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f7:h(t) =ω·(k−Y(t))η·v(t)1−η,
8:221:18258:39:22:72:448:441:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whereη∈(0,1)is the matching elasticity, andω>0 is the matching efficacy.
8:222:18330:22:22:89:539:419:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:The market tightnessx(t)is the ratio of the two arguments in the matching function:x(t)≡
8:223:18418:22:21:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:v(t)/(k−Y(t)).   With  constant  returns  to  scale  in  matching,  the  tightness  determines  the  rates
8:224:18524:21:22:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:at which sellers and buyers enter into new long-term trading relationships.  Each of thek−Y(t)
8:225:18618:22:22:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:units of idle capacity is sold at ratef(x(t)) =h(t)/(k−Y(t)) =ω·x(t)1−ηand each of thev(t)
8:226:18708:22:21:71:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:vacancies is filled at rateq(x(t)) =h(t)/v(t) =ω·x(t)−η.  The selling ratef(x)is increasing in

8:228:18899:22:22:71:405:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services but harder to buy them. A useful result is thatf(x) =q(x)·x.

8:238:19397:21:22:72:540:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:out the paper, we therefore simplify the analysis by modeling output as a jump variable equal to

9:252:20243:21:22:89:539:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Advertising vacancies is costly. Posting one vacancy costsρ>0 services per unit time. Hence,

9:255:20529:21:22:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These resources devoted to matching are not consumed by households in that they do not enter
9:256:20621:22:22:71:539:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:their utility function. Hence, households’ consumption of private services, denoted byc(t), equals

9:262:21138:22:22:89:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:Equation (1) and the definition of the market tightness imply thats·Y(t) =f(x(t))·(k−Y(t)) =

10:276:22023:21:22:71:539:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is more difficult to match with a seller so the matching wedge is higher. The elasticity ofτ(x)with

10:278:22146:22:39:89:410:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We write total consumption as a function of tightness and capacity:

10:283:22239:40:22:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This functiony(x,k)plays a central role in the analysis because it gives the amount of services that
10:284:22339:22:21:71:539:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:can be allocated to consumption for a given tightness. The expression (4) shows that consumption
10:285:22435:21:22:71:540:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is below the capacitykbecause some services are not sold (u(x)>0) and some services are used

11:347:24611:29:22:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In developing the demand structure of the model, we have two objectives. The first is to develop an
11:348:24710:22:22:71:539:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:aggregate demand rich enough to capture the different possible effects of government purchases,
11:349:24805:22:21:71:539:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:such as the stimulus of aggregate demand by government purchases or the crowding out of private
11:350:24900:21:22:71:248:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption by public consumption.
11:351:24934:22:22:89:539:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These effects are not necessarily present in macroeconomic models. Typical matching models
11:352:25024:22:21:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are an example.  In these models,  a free-entry condition determines equilibrium tightness.  The
11:353:25120:21:22:71:539:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:free-entry condition is independent of government purchases so an increase in government pur-
11:354:25213:22:22:71:540:177:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:chases has no effect on tightness and total consumption. As discussed inMichaillat(2014), public
11:355:25309:22:21:71:539:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption therefore crowds out private consumption one-for-one.  To allow for less-than-full
11:356:25403:21:22:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:crowding out, we allow the aggregate demand to be less than perfectly tightness elastic.  Typical
11:357:25500:22:22:71:539:112:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:disequilibrium models are another example: the demand for private consumption is unaffected by
11:358:25594:22:0:71:539:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public consumption so there is no crowding out and the multiplier is exactly one (for example,
12:359:25690:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mankiw and Weinzierl 2011).  The the multiplier also is exactly one in typical New Keynesian
12:360:25782:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:models when monetary policy is held constant (Woodford 2011). To allow for some crowding out,
12:361:25875:22:21:72:331:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we allow the aggregate demand to be tightness elastic.
12:362:25929:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The advantage of a rich demand structure is to accommodate a wide range of multipliers. This
12:363:26021:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:facilitates the mapping between the model and the data. If the price of services does not respond to
12:364:26121:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases, utility is separable in private and public consumption, and taxation is lump
12:365:26219:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sum, the output multiplier would be one in a disequilibrium model and zero in a matching model.
12:366:26314:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In our model, the output multiplier can be anywhere between zero and one because the aggregate
12:367:26408:22:21:72:441:534:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:demand is neither perfectly tightness inelastic nor perfectly tightness elastic.8
12:368:26489:21:22:89:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The second objective is to develop an aggregate demand that is nondegenerate such that aggre-
12:369:26582:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gate demand and supply intersect to give the equilibrium level of tightness.  To avoid degeneracy,
12:370:26680:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the aggregate demand curve needs to involve the tightness and price of services. This requirement
12:371:26777:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on the aggregate demand is equivalent to preventing the demand and supply curves of a Walrasian
12:372:26872:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:market to be both price inelastic.  Indeed, if both demand and supply are perfectly price inelastic
12:373:26971:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(vertical in a standard price-quantity diagram), the equilibrium exists only if the two curves overlap
12:374:27073:21:22:72:536:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the intersection of the two curves does not determine a price. We want to avoid this problem.
12:375:27170:22:22:89:539:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To generate an aggregate demand satisfying the requirements, we introduce an asset in fixed
12:376:27261:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:supply and assume that households derive utility from holding this asset. Households spend part of
12:377:27359:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:their labor income on services and save part of it using the asset. Household hold the asset because
12:378:27459:22:39:72:507:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:they desire to smooth consumption over time and they derive utility from holding the asset.
12:379:27550:39:21:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:An  Example  with  Land.The  asset  that  we  introduce  is  land.   Households  derive  utility  from
12:380:27652:21:22:72:539:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:holdingl(t)units of land. This utility captures for instance the housing services provided by land.
12:381:27751:22:22:72:539:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Land is traded on a perfectly competitive market. The supply of land is fixed atl0. In equilibrium,
12:382:27850:22:21:71:539:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the land market clears sol(t) =l0. This demand structure is similar to the structure found in models
12:383:27950:21:22:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that study the role of land and land prices in causing or propagating business cycles. For instance,
12:384:28050:22:22:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:models by Iacoviello (2005), Liu, Wang and Zha (2013), and Kocherlakota (2013) assume that
12:385:28140:22:21:71:536:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:land enters the utility function, is traded on a perfectly competitive market, and is in fixed supply.

12:387:28337:19:15:85:539:87:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:8If the price of services responds to government purchases, utility is not separable, and taxation is distortionary,
12:388:28453:15:0:72:293:72:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the output multiplier can be negative or larger than one.
13:389:28512:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:itive, the price would be determined such that the supply and demand of services are equal.  On
13:390:28607:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a matching market things are different; we specify a general price mechanism that determines the
13:391:28703:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:price of services:p(t) =p(g(t)).  Given the price of services, tightness adjusts such that supply
13:392:28800:21:22:72:273:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equals demand on the market for services.
13:393:28841:22:22:89:539:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The government balances its budget at all times using a lump-sum taxT(t) =G(t)levied on

13:409:29742:39:40:72:551:250:12:g_d0_f25:12:g_d0_f6:H(t,c(t),l(t)) =U(c(t),g(t))+V(l(t))+λ(t)[p(t)(1−u(x(t)))k−p(t)(1+τ(x(t)))c(t)−T(t)]
13:410:29826:40:22:72:539:210:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with control variablec(t), state variablel(t), and current-value costate variableλ(t).  The first-
13:411:29924:22:21:72:539:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:order conditions for an interior solution to the maximization problem are∂H/∂c=0,∂H/∂l=

14:418:30234:22:22:89:539:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We now describe the equilibrium for a given public consumption,g.  An equilibrium consists

14:421:30518:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the equality of supply and demand on the market for services, the third is the equality of supply and
14:422:30619:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:demand on the market for land, the fourth is the price mechanism on the market for services, and

14:424:30814:22:22:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The equilibrium can be represented as a dynamical system of dimension 1.  The only variable
14:425:30905:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the system is the costate variableλ(t). All the other variables can be recovered fromλ(t). The
14:426:31002:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variableλ(t)satisfies the differential equation ̇λ(t) =δ·λ(t)−V′(l0). The steady-state value of
14:427:31097:22:22:71:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the costate variable isλ=V′(l0)/δ>0.  Sinceδ>0, we infer that the dynamical system is a
14:428:31184:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:source.  As there is no state variable, the system immediately jumps to the steady state from any
14:429:31281:21:22:71:150:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:initial condition.
14:430:31299:22:22:89:540:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For a giveng, the equilibrium is always in steady state.  The welfare associated with the equi-
14:431:31394:22:21:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:librium therefore is the instantaneous welfare,U(c,g) +V(l0).  For the policy analysis, we need
14:432:31489:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to relatectog; asc=y(x,k)−g, we need to relatextog. We can do that using the property that

14:444:31939:21:22:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:implies that at the margin the household is indifferent between purchasing one unit of land and
14:445:32034:22:22:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending the same amount on private services.  The equation determines the aggregate demand,

14:447:32222:21:22:71:539:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time discount rate,δ; with higher marginal utility of land or lower time discount rate, households
14:448:32320:22:0:71:427:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:desire to save more and consume less, which depresses aggregate demand.

15:454:32770:21:22:72:420:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:three examples yield the same equilibrium structure as the land example.

15:456:32937:22:21:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equilibrium, tightness is a function of the provision of public services:x=x(g).  The tightness
15:457:33032:21:22:71:540:482:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:functionx(g)is determined by households’ utility function, the price mechanism, and the supply

15:467:33940:22:22:71:513:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are useful to stabilize the economy—that is, bring unemployment closer to its efficient level.
15:468:34034:22:21:89:539:243:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In our theory, we take as given all other potential policies that could affect economic activity.
15:469:34131:21:22:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These other policies could fully stabilize the economy.  Our analysis would trivially apply in that
15:470:34230:22:22:71:539:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:case. But these policies may not be able to keep unemployment at its efficient level.9Our analysis
15:471:34328:22:21:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentrates on these cases. In our example with bonds, monetary policy could adjust the nominal

15:473:34526:22:18:71:539:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:monetary policy to achieve this goal perfectly.  In the other examples taxes could affect relative

16:481:35293:34:21:71:539:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This section describes the optimal level of government purchases in the model of Section 2.  We

16:484:35581:22:21:71:192:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and private consumption.
16:485:35605:21:22:89:539:521:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The rest of the paper will complement this section in several ways.  Section 4shows that the

16:487:35787:22:21:71:540:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:supply and distortionary taxation.  Section5 explains the relationship between the unemployment
16:488:35882:21:22:71:539:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier used in our formulas and the output multiplier commonly used in academic and policy

16:490:36074:22:21:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The application shows how to calibrate the formulas and provides orders of magnitude for the

18:583:40057:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:completely obvious.   This result suggests that the Samuelson formula is robust:  it applies to a
18:584:40154:22:21:71:364:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:broad range of models as long as productive efficiency holds.
18:585:40215:21:22:89:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:An implication of the formula is that the provision of public services is sometimes justified
18:586:40308:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:even if public services are not as valuable as private services.  Imagine that one public service is
18:587:40408:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:never as valuable as one private service:∂U/∂g<∂U/∂corMRSgc<1 for any(c,g).  In that
18:588:40492:21:22:71:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:case the Samuelson formula indicates that no public services should be provided:g=0.  But in a
18:589:40586:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:matching model, it may be optimal to provide some public services for stabilization. This happens
18:590:40683:22:21:71:424:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when the correction term evaluated atg=0 is greater than 1−MRSgc(0).
18:591:40751:21:22:89:539:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Formula (12) remains abstract, so we rework it to express it with sufficient statistics.  We start

19:617:41785:40:21:89:540:628:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The Samuelson level is the level ofG/Cthat satisfies the Samuelson formula.  WhenG/Cis
19:618:41871:21:22:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:at the Samuelson level, the marginal values from public and private consumption are equal. Since
19:619:41967:22:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:MRSgc(0)≥1 andMRSgcis decreasing inG/C, the Samuelson level is always well defined.  The
19:620:42055:22:21:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Samuelson level is determined by households’ preferences,  so it does not depend on economic
19:621:42147:21:22:72:125:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:conditions.
19:622:42158:22:22:89:547:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption measures how the marginal
19:623:42253:22:21:72:539:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rate of substitution between public and private consumption varies withG/C. SinceMRSgcis de-
19:624:42345:21:22:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:creasing inG/C, the elasticity of substitution is positive. A lower elasticity of substitution implies
19:625:42447:22:22:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that the marginal value of public consumption, measured relative to the marginal value of private
19:626:42544:22:21:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption, decreases faster withG/C.  The elasticity of substitution has two interesting limits.
19:627:42642:21:22:72:539:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Whenε→0, public and private consumption are perfect complement.13This means that a certain
19:628:42732:22:22:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of public services are needed for a given economy, but beyond that number, additional
19:629:42824:22:21:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public services have zero value—additional public workers dig and fill holes.   In that case,  the
19:630:42922:21:22:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:marginal rate of substitution falls to zero as soon the required number of public services is pro-
19:631:43020:22:22:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:vided.  Whenε→+∞, the public and private consumption are perfect substitute.14This means
19:632:43108:22:21:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that households are equally happy to consume a unit of private or public services. In that case, the
19:633:43208:21:22:72:284:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:marginal rate of substitution is constant at 1.
19:634:43255:22:22:89:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The unemployment multiplier measures the percent increase in employment, 1−u, when pub-
19:635:43342:22:21:72:539:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:lic  consumption  increases  by  1  percent  of  total  consumption.   In  practice,  1−u≈1  som≈
19:636:43439:21:22:72:539:217:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:−du/(dg/y).  Hence, the unemployment multiplier approximately gives the decrease of the un-
19:637:43530:22:22:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:employment rate, measured in percentage points, when public consumption increases by 1 percent
19:638:43624:22:21:72:174:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of total consumption.
19:639:43645:21:22:89:539:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The Samuelson level and the elasticity of substitution reflect the value that society places on
19:640:43740:22:22:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public services.  We will not estimate them, but treat them as an input for policy design.  On the
19:641:43838:22:18:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other hand, we will obtain estimates of the unemployment multiplier from the empirical literature.

21:738:45438:39:31:72:284:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We obtain (18) by rearranging this equation.
21:739:45482:31:22:89:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Equation (16) shows that 1−MRSgcdepends on the deviation ofG/Cfrom the Samuelson

21:741:45660:21:22:72:391:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:directly follows from the definition of the elasticity of substitution.
21:742:45731:22:22:89:539:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Equation (17) shows that the elasticity of total consumption with respect to tightness is ap-
21:743:45824:22:21:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:proximately equal to the unemployment gap (as 1−u∗≈1).  Hence, the unemployment gap is
21:744:45910:21:22:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a precise measure of productive inefficiency.  Imagine tightness increases by 20 percent.  If the
21:745:46007:22:22:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment gap is 10 percentage points total consumption increases by 2 percent;  but if the
21:746:46101:22:21:72:523:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment gap is only 5 percentage points, total consumption only increases by 1 percent.
21:747:46193:21:22:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Last, equation (18) relates the unemployment multiplier to the effect of public consumption
21:748:46284:22:22:72:539:381:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on tightness (dx/dg). This equation directly follows from the relationship between unemployment

21:768:47113:22:0:72:539:76:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ployment gap (u−u∗).  The formula allows us to derive several qualitative properties of optimal
22:769:47210:0:22:72:182:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases.
22:770:47231:22:22:89:539:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The formula shows that the welfare-maximizing level of government purchases depends on
22:771:47317:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a government-spending multiplier, confirming an intuition that macroeconomists have had for a
22:772:47410:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:long time. Academic and policy discussions about government spending, however, usually revolve
22:773:47504:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:around the output multiplier,  not the unemployment multiplier.   The output and unemployment
22:774:47597:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multipliers are closely related, as we will show in Section 5.  But the unemployment multiplier
22:775:47692:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:has an advantage over the output multiplier: it remains a valid sufficient statistics when taxation is
22:776:47794:22:22:72:354:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distortionary, which is not the case of the output multiplier.
22:777:47856:22:21:89:539:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:However,  the  multiplier  is  not  sufficient  to  measure  the  effect  of  government  purchases  on
22:778:47959:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:welfare because an increase in government purchases also affects the composition of households’
22:779:48054:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption.  This is why of substitution between public and private consumption also enters the
22:780:48150:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:formula.  The elasticity matters because it determines how quickly the marginal value of public
22:781:48245:21:22:72:322:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services fades when government purchases increase.
22:782:48295:22:22:89:539:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Formula (19) allows us to determine under which conditions public spending should be higher
22:783:48386:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than the Samuelson level.  We find that when the unemployment multiplier is positive—such that
22:784:48480:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:an increase in government purchases reduces the unemployment rate—optimal public spending is
22:785:48572:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:above the Samuelson level whenever unemployment is inefficiently high. On the other hand, when
22:786:48666:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment multiplier is negative—such that an increase in government purchases raises
22:787:48758:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment rate—optimal public spending is above the Samuelson level whenever unem-
22:788:48847:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ployment is inefficiently low.  It is only if the unemployment multiplier is zero that government
22:789:48944:22:21:72:517:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases should always be at the Samuelson level. These results are summarized in Table 1.
22:790:49035:21:22:89:539:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To understand these results, imagine that public consumption is at the Samuelson level, the
22:791:49126:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment multiplier is positive, and unemployment is inefficiently high.  Keeping total con-
22:792:49222:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sumption  constant,  increasing  public  consumption  by  1  unit  reduces  private  consumption  by  1
22:793:49325:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unit.  At the Samuelson level, the marginal utilities of public and private consumption are equal-
22:794:49423:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ized.  Hence, the increase in public consumption has no first-order effect on welfare so far.  Since
22:795:49523:22:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment multiplier is positive,  increasing public consumption lowers unemployment.
22:796:49615:22:21:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Since unemployment is inefficiently high, reducing unemployment raises total consumption. Once
22:797:49709:21:22:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the effect on government purchases on unemployment is accounted for, the increase in public con-
22:798:49805:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sumption has a positive effect on welfare.  Thus, it is optimal to raise public spending above the

23:811:50532:21:22:71:539:465:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:US data.  This empirical result, combined with our theoretical analysis, suggests that government
23:812:50629:22:22:71:539:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases should be countercyclical if the unemployment multiplier is positive,  acyclical if the
23:813:50726:22:21:71:516:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment multiplier is zero, and procyclical if the unemployment multiplier is negative.
23:814:50818:21:22:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Formula (19) implies that the unemployment rate is inefficiently high or low, optimal govern-

23:816:51001:22:21:71:539:356:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases should fill the unemployment gap only partially, not completely. Indeed, if

23:822:51483:21:22:71:539:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:hand-side of the formula is endogenous to the policy, we cannot read the optimal level ofG/C
23:823:51575:22:22:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:off the formula. This means that we cannot use the formula to answer quantitative questions such
23:824:51671:22:21:71:539:153:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as  “How  much  should  government  purchases  increase  if  the  unemployment  rate  rises  to  9%?”
23:825:51772:21:22:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and “How does the amplitude of the increase depend on the multiplier or the value of new public
23:826:51867:22:22:71:539:110:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:services?”.  This is a typical limitation of the sufficient-statistics approach, for which it has often
23:827:51970:22:0:71:539:88:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:been criticized (Chetty 2009).  Here we develop an explicit formula that addresses this limitation
24:828:52070:0:22:72:414:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and provides quantitative insights about optimal government purchases.

24:855:52970:22:21:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inefficient.  Sinceu06=u∗, the optimalG/Cdeparts from(G/C)∗.  In (19), the multipliermand

24:857:53141:22:22:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and we cannot read the optimalG/Coff the formula. In this proof, we derive a formula giving the
24:858:53236:22:21:71:289:288:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:optimalG/Cas a function of fixed quantities.
24:859:53280:21:22:89:540:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:First, we express the equilibrium values of all variables as functions of[u,G/C].  Lemma1

24:864:53688:22:21:89:539:158:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Of course not all pairs[u,G/C]describe an equilibrium:  the only pairs describing an equi-

24:867:53959:22:22:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rium condition defines the unemployment rate as an implicit functionu(G/C)ofG/C.  The pairs
24:868:54050:22:0:71:540:71:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:describing an equilibrium therefore are the pairs[u(G/C),G/C]for anyG/C>0.   These pairs

26:977:56957:31:22:89:539:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Formula (20) links the departure of the optimal government purchases from the Samuelson

26:981:57328:22:21:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mula is explicit because the right-hand side is not endogenous to the policy. Formula (21) links the

26:983:57516:22:22:89:539:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The multiplier in the formula (m0) is the multiplier when the unemployment rate isu0.  If the

26:985:57695:21:22:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average unemployment multiplier over the business cycle. However, a growing body of empirical
26:986:57788:22:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evidence suggests that the unemployment multiplier could be higher when the unemployment rate
27:987:57883:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is higher and output lower.15Hence, to obtain accurate measures ofm0, the empirical estimation
27:988:57977:22:22:72:482:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should probably allow the multiplier to depend on the underlying unemployment rate.
27:989:58060:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Formulas (20) and (21) confirm that optimal government purchases deviate from the Samuel-
27:990:58149:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:son level to partially fill the initial unemployment gap.  The formulas also show that the optimal
27:991:58247:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases and the unemployment gap under the optimal policy crucially depend on

28:1039:59786:31:21:89:539:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For concreteness the proposition considers positive unemployment multipliers and unemploy-
28:1040:59876:21:22:72:329:604:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:ment gaps, so optimal stimulus spending is positive.16
28:1041:59930:22:22:89:539:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The first part of the proposition studies how the optimal level of stimulus spending depends on
28:1042:60025:22:21:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the size of the unemployment multiplier. There is a presumption that stimulus spending should be
28:1043:60121:21:22:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:larger when the unemployment multiplier is larger.  At first glance, formula (19) seems to justify
28:1044:60219:22:22:72:539:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this  bang-for-the-buck  logic:  for  a  givenu−u∗,  a  largermseems  to  indicate  that  the  optimal

28:1046:60408:21:22:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:similar to (19) in a new Keynesian model and conclude that “the extent of extra desirable spending
28:1047:60506:22:22:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:will depend on the size of the multiplier,  with a larger multiplier implying that more spending
28:1048:60602:22:21:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is desirable.”  However, this bang-for-the-buck logic is incomplete because it omits the response
28:1049:60699:21:22:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of unemployment to government spending in formula (19).  The multiplier also determines how
28:1050:60790:22:22:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:strongly unemployment responds to government purchases, and the link between the size of the
28:1051:60882:22:21:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier and the optimal level of stimulus spending is more complicated than suggested by the

28:1056:61279:22:22:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ployment multiplier:  the optimal level of stimulus spending is increasing in the multiplier until a
28:1057:61379:22:21:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:threshold, and decreasing in the multiplier after that. The multiplier that calls for the highest level
28:1058:61482:21:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of stimulus spending is given by (27).  The highest level of stimulus spending a given unemploy-
28:1059:61578:22:22:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment gap is given by (28). We infer that the bang-for-the-buck logic applies when the multiplier is
28:1060:61677:22:21:72:328:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:below (27), but not when the multiplier is above (27).
28:1061:61731:21:22:89:539:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There is a simple intuition behind this result. First, consider a small multiplier. We can neglect
28:1062:61829:22:22:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the feedback of government spending on unemployment because the multiplier is small. So in (19)
28:1063:61924:22:18:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we can setu=u0, and it becomes clear thatG/Cincreases with the multiplier. Intuitively, for small
28:1064:62021:18:15:82:539:87:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:16We consider a positive unemployment multiplier because this case is the most empirically relevant, as discussed
28:1065:62134:15:0:72:417:72:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in Section 6. We could derive similar results with a negative unemployment multiplier.
29:1066:62222:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multipliers, the optimal level of government purchases is determined by the level of crowding out of
29:1067:62322:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:private consumption by public consumption. A higher multiplier means that there is less crowding
29:1068:62418:22:21:72:356:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:out and thus that government purchases are more desirable.
29:1069:62476:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Next,  consider a large multiplier.  Government purchases is such a potent policy that it can
29:1070:62569:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:close the unemployment gap without distorting much the allocation of output between public and
29:1071:62663:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:private consumption.  Hence, the optimal policy broadly is to fill the unemployment gapu0−u∗.
29:1072:62756:21:22:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In fact, unemployment under the optimal policy converges to efficient as the multiplier becomes
29:1073:62851:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:large, indicating that the unemployment gap is converging to zero. As the unemployment multiplier
29:1074:62948:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rises, fewer government purchases are required to fill this unemployment gap, so the optimal level
29:1075:63046:21:22:71:314:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of stimulus spending decreases with the multiplier.
29:1076:63097:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The proposition also shows that a higher elasticity of substitution between public and private
29:1077:63191:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption entails a stronger response of government purchases to fluctuations in unemployment.
29:1078:63287:21:22:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Both the optimal level of stimulus spending and the share of the unemployment gap filled under
29:1079:63381:22:22:71:378:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the optimal policy are increasing in the elasticity of substitution.
29:1080:63449:22:21:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There  are  two  interesting  special  cases.   The  first  special  case  isε→0.   In  this  situation,
29:1081:63553:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:additional public services have zero value, so additional public workers dig and fill holes.  In that
29:1082:63654:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:case, the optimal stimulus spending is zero, irrespective of the unemployment rate and multiplier.
29:1083:63752:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Intuitively, public consumption beyond the Samuelson level is useless. Since public consumption
29:1084:63847:21:22:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:always crowds out private consumption, it is never optimal to provide more public consumption
29:1085:63940:22:22:71:221:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than in the Samuelson formula.
29:1086:63970:22:21:89:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The second special case isε→+∞. In this situation, the public services provided by the gov-
29:1087:64061:21:22:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ernment perfectly substitute for the private services purchased by households. In that case, optimal
29:1088:64161:22:22:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stimulus spending completely fills the unemployment gap such thatu=u∗. This result holds even
29:1089:64254:22:22:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if the multiplier is very small and government purchases severely crowd out household purchases.
29:1090:64350:22:21:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Intuitively, public and private consumption are interchangeable, so it is optimal to maximize to-
29:1091:64447:21:22:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tal consumption, irrespective of its composition.  Accordingly, it is optimal to completely fill the
29:1092:64547:22:22:71:166:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment gap.
29:1093:64564:22:21:89:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f10:The result that government purchases should be used to fill the unemployment gap whenε→∞
29:1094:64652:21:22:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is reminiscent of the Keynesian result that government purchases should be used to fill the output
29:1095:64750:22:0:71:539:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gap.   Mankiw and Weinzierl(2011) formally derive the Keynesian result with a disequilibrium
30:1096:64844:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model. In their model, there is no crowding out of household purchases by government purchases.
30:1097:64939:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If government purchases have some value,  government purchases should be increased until the
30:1098:65031:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f10:output gap is entirely filled. But the logics behind the Keynesian result and our result whenε→∞
30:1099:65127:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are completely different.  The Keynesian result arises because there is no crowding out of private
30:1100:65225:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption by public consumption.  In our model there is crowding out, but the composition of
30:1101:65319:22:21:72:496:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:total consumption does not matter whenε→∞, so the crowding out has no welfare cost.
30:1102:65402:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In reality, it is likely that public services have some value at the margin without being perfect
30:1103:65499:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:substitutes for private services; that is,ε>0 butε<+∞. In that case the optimal level of stimulus
30:1104:65596:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending  is  positive,  but  not  sufficient  to  completely  fill  the  unemployment  gap.   Hence,  even
30:1105:65703:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with optimal government purchases, the unemployment rate remains inefficient. This result arises
30:1106:65799:22:45:72:344:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:because government purchases are not a first-best policy.

30:1108:65919:34:21:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:So far we have abstracted from tax distortions. In this section we extend the model by introducing
30:1109:66017:21:22:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:an endogenous labor supply and a distortionary income tax. In this extended model, an increase in
30:1110:66114:22:22:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases affects the aggregate demand, as before, and the aggregate supply, because
30:1111:66209:22:21:72:395:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:it triggers an increase in taxes that affects households’ labor supply.
30:1112:66280:21:22:89:539:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We consider two types of taxes: a linear income tax, and a nonlinear income tax implemented
30:1113:66371:22:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:following the benefit principle. Using a linear income tax is the traditional approach in public eco-
30:1114:66472:22:21:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nomics and the standard approach in macroeconomics.  Using the benefit principle is the modern
30:1115:66566:21:44:72:479:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:approach in public economics. In both cases, the results from Section 3 remain valid.
30:1116:66651:44:29:72:325:217:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:4.1.    The Traditional Approach to Taxation
30:1117:66695:29:22:72:539:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The representative household supplies a productive capacityk(t)at some utility cost. The choice of
30:1118:66793:22:22:72:539:166:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f8:k(t)is akin to a labor-supply decision. The instantaneous utility function becomesU(c(t),g(t))−
30:1119:66888:22:21:72:539:144:12:g_d0_f25:12:g_d0_f4:W(k(t)) +V(b(t)), where the functionWis strictly increasing inkand convex.  Since timing is
30:1120:66979:21:22:72:389:123:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not ambiguous, we simplify notation by dropping the time indext.
30:1121:67043:22:22:89:539:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this subsection, the government uses a linear income tax at rateτLto finance government
30:1122:67133:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases. The household’s labor income becomes(1−τL)·Y(x,k) = (1−τL)·(1−u(x))·k. To
31:1123:67219:0:22:72:399:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:finance public consumptiong, the tax rate must beτL=G/Y=g/y.

31:1128:67563:22:39:71:519:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:combine this equation with the first-order condition with respect toc, given by (8). We obtain

31:1134:67776:22:21:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consumption. This equation describes households’ optimal labor supply. It says that the marginal
31:1135:67872:21:22:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rate  of  substitution  between  labor  and  consumption  has  to  be  equal  to  the  post-tax  real  wage.
31:1136:67980:22:22:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:Indeed, one unit of labor is only sold with probability 1−u. When it is sold, it only yields 1/(1+τ)
31:1137:68080:22:21:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:units of consumption. Hence, the effective real wage is(1−u)/(1+τ)and the post-tax real wage
31:1138:68172:21:22:72:206:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is(1−τL)·(1−u)/(1+τ).
31:1139:68193:22:22:89:539:354:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The supply decision is distorted by the income tax: a higherτLimplies a lowerk. In fact, equa-

32:1212:69489:21:22:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases formula can be written as the modified Samuelson formula plus a correc-

32:1215:69767:21:22:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the labor supply so it costs more to produce one public service than one private service.  Because
32:1216:69865:22:22:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the marginal cost of funds is greater than one,  the modified Samuelson formula recommends a
32:1217:69957:22:21:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower level of government purchases than the regular formula.  Although the Samuelson level of
32:1218:70051:21:22:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases is lower with a linear income tax, the correction to the Samuelson formula
32:1219:70146:22:22:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the same, so the deviation of optimal government purchases from the Samuelson level remains
32:1220:70240:22:31:72:465:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the same. In fact, the implicit formula (19) remains valid with a linear income tax:

32:1228:70825:20:15:82:540:118:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:17The modified Samuelson formula was developed byStiglitz and Dasgupta(1971) andAtkinson and Stern(1974)

33:1232:71215:0:22:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we  haveMRSgc((G/C)∗)−MRSgc(G/C) = (1/ε)·[(G/C−(G/C)∗)/(G/C)∗].   Moreover,  (17)
33:1233:71296:22:31:72:376:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and (18) remain valid. Combining these results, we obtain (19).
33:1234:71359:31:21:89:539:655:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The unemployment multiplier in formula (19) is a policy elasticity, in the sense ofHendren
33:1235:71449:21:22:71:539:634:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2015). It measures the change in unemployment for a change in government purchases accompa-

33:1237:71636:22:21:71:539:590:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distortionary, so the unemployment multiplier should be measured using a policy reform in which
33:1238:71731:21:22:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:taxes are nondistortionary.  Here taxes are distortionary, so the unemployment multiplier should
33:1239:71827:22:22:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be measured using a policy reform in which the tax change distorts the labor supply.  Moreover,
33:1240:71922:22:21:71:540:525:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Michaillat and Saez(2015) show that tightness rises and the unemployment rate falls in response
33:1241:72017:21:22:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to a reduction in labor supply. Therefore, we expect unemployment multipliers to be larger under
33:1242:72113:22:22:71:354:482:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distortionary taxation than under nondistortionary taxation.

34:1288:73616:21:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is justified if the government values redistribution (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971). It is also justified
34:1289:73718:22:22:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if low-income workers are unable to pay a uniform lump-sum tax. These two reasons explain why
34:1290:73811:22:21:72:232:541:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:real tax systems are distortionary.
34:1291:73846:21:22:89:539:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To improve the realism of the analysis of Section3, we now assume that labor supply is en-
34:1292:73936:22:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dogenous and government purchases are financed by a distortionary income tax. However, because
34:1293:74030:22:21:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:households are homogenous in the model, our welfare analysis cannot capture the benefits of the
34:1294:74125:21:22:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distortionary income tax, such as higher redistribution. Our welfare analysis can only includes the
34:1295:74224:22:22:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost of the distortionary income tax: a deadweight loss proportional to the labor-supply response.
34:1296:74322:22:21:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Because it considers the cost but not the benefits of the distortionary income tax, our welfare anal-
34:1297:74423:21:22:72:198:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ysis is bound to be biased.
34:1298:74450:22:22:89:539:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To overcome this bias, we follow the modern approach to taxation developed in public eco-
34:1299:74539:22:21:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nomics.  This approach consists in using a nonlinear income tax scheduleT(k)and implementing
34:1300:74631:21:22:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tax reforms following the benefit principle.  With the income tax, the household’s disposable in-
34:1301:74728:22:22:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:come becomes(1−u(x))·(k−T(k)). Because the tax distortions exist for reasons unrelated to the
34:1302:74821:22:21:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:provision of public goods, the benefit principle argues that an increase in government purchases
34:1303:74917:21:22:72:539:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should be financed by a tax increase that does not alter labor-supply distortions.18More precisely,
34:1304:75016:22:22:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a change in government purchases is financed by a tax change designed to leave individual utility
34:1305:75113:22:21:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unchanged for any level of labor supply. As a consequence, the labor-supply decision is unaffected
34:1306:75211:21:22:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by the policy reform. Then, a Pareto improvement is possible if the reform generates a government
34:1307:75308:22:22:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:budget surplus or deficit. A surplus can be redistributed to households, creating a Pareto improve-
34:1308:75407:22:21:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment. With a deficit, the opposite of the reform generates a surplus, making a Pareto improvement
34:1309:75504:21:19:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:possible. Hence, the formula for optimal government purchases ensures that any reform leaves the

34:1312:75812:12:12:71:539:84:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:approach is closely related to the approach ofChristiansen(1981),Sandmo(1998),Coate(2000),Jacobs(2016), and
34:1313:75919:12:0:71:510:72:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:others, who study the optimal provision of public goods when taxes optimally satisfy redistributive objectives.
35:1314:76032:0:32:72:408:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government budget balanced. We find that formula (12) does just that:

36:1371:78469:33:22:71:539:401:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The results in Sections3 and4 are based on the unemployment multiplier. But academic and policy
36:1372:78564:22:21:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:discussions about government spending usually involve the output multiplier.  In this section, we

38:1515:82148:31:21:89:539:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The proposition establishes that the empirical unemployment multiplier is the output multiplier

38:1518:82429:22:21:71:539:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:income tax is distortionary, the supply-side response is negative and the unemployment multiplier
38:1519:82526:21:22:71:237:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is larger than the output multiplier.
38:1520:82563:22:22:89:539:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The unemployment multiplier is the correct sufficient statistic whether labor supply is exoge-

38:1522:82751:21:22:71:539:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or under the benefit principle, output and unemployment multipliers are the same so the output
38:1523:82845:22:22:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier matters for optimal government purchases exactly in the same way as the unemploy-
38:1524:82937:22:21:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment multiplier.  With distortionary taxation, things are different.  Optimal government purchases
38:1525:83035:21:22:71:539:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:depend on the unemployment multiplier, and the unemployment multiplier is equal to the output

39:1530:83448:22:21:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(around−0.6) once tax distortions are taken into account.  On the other hand,Monacelli, Perotti
39:1531:83543:21:22:72:539:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Trigari(2010) andRamey(2013) finds that the empirical unemployment multiplier is positive
39:1532:83636:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(around 0.5). One potential issue is that the unemployment multipliers are estimated using deficit-
39:1533:83735:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:financed increases in government purchases,  not balanced-budget increases (Barro and Redlick
39:1534:83828:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2011).  This issue is not very important here because unemployment multipliers are larger once
39:1535:83922:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the negative response of labor supply to distortionary taxes is taken into account.  This is because
39:1536:84022:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a reduction in labor supply leads to higher tightness and lower unemployment in the matching
39:1537:84114:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model (Michaillat and Saez 2015). Hence, 0.5 is a lower bound for the balanced-budget empirical
39:1538:84209:22:22:72:196:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment multiplier.
39:1539:84233:22:21:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Theory also shows that unemployment multiplier and output multiplier may have the opposite
39:1540:84323:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sign.  In the matching model,  the unemployment multiplier is necessarily positive,  whereas the
39:1541:84419:22:22:72:448:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output multiplier can be negative if labor-supply distortions are strong enough.
39:1542:84499:22:21:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When the output multiplier is negative and the unemployment multiplier is positive, govern-
39:1543:84590:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment purchases and the taxes used to finance them should be above the Samuelson level in slumps.
39:1544:84686:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This is surprising. How can lowering output through higher taxes be optimal when output is already
39:1545:84784:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inefficiently low? To understand this result, imagine that government purchases are the Samuelson
39:1546:84881:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level and that unemployment is inefficiently high.  A small increase in government purchases re-
39:1547:84977:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:duces unemployment, reduces labor supply, and increase public consumption, which are all good
39:1548:85070:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for welfare; but it reduces output and thus private consumption, which is bad for welfare.  At the
39:1549:85168:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Samuelson level, the cost of lower private consumption offsets the benefit of higher public con-
39:1550:85264:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sumption and lower labor supply; the only remaining effect on welfare is the positive effect from
39:1551:85361:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower unemployment. (When the unemployment rate is efficient, variations in unemployment have
39:1552:85454:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:no first-order effects on welfare so the Samuelson level is optimal.) Overall, the small increase in
39:1553:85554:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases raises welfare.  Hence, it is optimal to raise government purchases above
39:1554:85648:22:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the Samuelson level.   At the same time,  the increase in government spending and taxes lowers
39:1555:85742:22:21:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output because the reduction in output due to lower labor supply dominates the increase in output
39:1556:85839:21:22:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:due to lower unemployment.  But, because the reduction in output due to lower labor supply is
39:1557:85932:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:already internalized in the modified Samuelson formula, it is the increase in output due to lower
40:1558:86031:0:45:72:473:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment that determines the deviation from the modified Samuelson formula.

40:1560:86179:34:22:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this section we use our explicit formula, given by (20), to compute the optimal response of gov-
40:1561:86278:22:21:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ernment purchases to the increase in unemployment observed at the onset of the Great Recession
40:1562:86372:21:22:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the United States. We examine how the optimal policy response varies with the unemployment
40:1563:86465:22:22:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier and the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption.  The results
40:1564:86563:22:21:72:194:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are displayed in Figure 2.
40:1565:86589:21:22:89:539:521:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The starting point of the numerical application is 2008:Q3 in the United States.   Then,  the
40:1566:86682:22:22:72:539:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment rate wasu=6% and government purchases wereG/C=19.7%.19To simplify
40:1567:86760:22:21:72:539:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the analysis, we consider the unemployment rate in 2008:Q3 as efficient:u∗=6%.  This choice
40:1568:86851:21:22:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is reasonable as the unemployment rate in 2008:Q3 is close to its 25-year average, and there is
40:1569:86946:22:22:72:539:434:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a presumption, going back at least toOkun(1963), that the economy is efficient on average.  If
40:1570:87040:22:21:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment is efficient in 2008:Q3, it is optimal for the government to follow the Samuelson
40:1571:87134:21:22:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:formula. To simplify the analysis further, we therefore set the Samuelson level to the government
40:1572:87231:22:22:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases in 2008:Q3:(G/C)∗=19.7%.  This choice seems reasonable asG/Cin 2008:Q3 is
40:1573:87314:22:21:72:203:347:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:equal its 25-year average.20
40:1574:87342:21:22:89:539:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In 2008, a shock hit the US economy and unemployment started rising toward an inefficient

40:1576:87523:22:21:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment slowly rises tou0.   The challenge for policymakers is to forecastu0before that
40:1577:87615:21:22:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level is reached. In the winter 2008–2009, when the US government was designing their stimulus
40:1578:87709:22:22:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:package, they forecastedu0=9% (Romer and Bernstein 2009, Figure 1).  We therefore useu0=
40:1579:87797:22:21:72:232:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:9% for the numerical application.
40:1580:87830:21:22:89:539:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To apply formula (20), we need estimates of three statistics:  the elasticity of substitution be-

41:1592:88992:22:22:89:539:621:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:Last, we determine a plausible range for the multiplierm0. Since the theoretical multiplierm0
41:1593:89085:22:21:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:is difficult to observe, we report estimates of the empirical multiplierM0.22We then translateM0

41:1597:89445:21:40:71:337:513:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:τ=1.7%. So we setτ0=1.7%. Under this calibration,

41:1610:89996:22:22:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and sample periods considered give unemployment multipliers between 0.2 and 0.5, except one

41:1612:90181:21:22:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:one potential issue is that these multipliers are estimated using deficit-financed increases in gov-
41:1613:90281:22:22:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ernment purchases, not balanced-budget increases.  This issue is not very important here because
41:1614:90377:22:21:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment multipliers are larger once the negative response of labor supply to distortionary
41:1615:90472:21:22:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:taxes is taken into account.  This is because a reduction in labor supply leads to higher tightness
41:1616:90571:22:22:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and lower unemployment in the matching model (Michaillat and Saez 2015).  Hence, these esti-
41:1617:90663:22:18:72:432:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mates are a lower bound for the balanced-budget unemployment multiplier.
41:1618:90735:18:12:82:424:155:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:21The caseε=1 corresponds to a Cobb-Douglas utility function:U(c,g) =c1−γ·gγ.
41:1619:90812:12:16:82:540:143:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:22The theoretical multiplierm0is difficult to directly estimate because it measures the response to a change in

41:1621:91027:12:12:71:540:115:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:matching and therefore difficult to observe. The empirical multiplierM0is much easier to estimate because it measures
41:1622:91144:12:8:71:444:103:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the response to a change in government purchasesG, which are reported in national accounts.

42:1624:91320:0:22:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We  can  also  measure  the  unemployment  multiplierM0from  estimates  of  the  output  multi-
42:1625:91415:22:22:71:539:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:plier obtained under deficit financing.  Indeed, under the standard assumption that households are
42:1626:91513:22:21:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Ricardian, deficit financing is equivalent to lump-sum taxation.  Then, under the typical assump-
42:1627:91610:21:22:71:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion that the utility functionU(c,g)is separable, changes in government purchases financed with

42:1629:91798:22:21:71:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output multipliers are the same (Proposition10).24Ramey(2011, Table 1) reports that in aggre-
42:1630:91891:21:22:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gate analyses on postwar US data, deficit-financed output multipliers are between 0.6 and 1.6. This
42:1631:91990:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evidence indicates that when the tax changes used to finance changes in government purchases are
42:1632:92086:22:21:71:440:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nondistortionary, the unemployment multiplier could be in the 0.6–1.6 range.
42:1633:92162:21:22:89:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Overall, the average unemployment multiplier is likely to fall in the 0.2–1.6 range.  If multi-

42:1635:92353:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dependent multipliers on US data,M0could even be larger.25Given the uncertainty about the exact
42:1636:92448:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimate of the unemployment multiplier, we compute the optimal level of stimulus spending for
42:1637:92542:22:22:72:170:426:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:M0between 0 and 2.

42:1640:92757:22:22:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:constructed using (20).  Initially the unemployment rate isu0=9%, but with the optimal policy
42:1641:92850:22:21:72:539:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment rate falls below its initial level. The graph on the right in Figure2 displays the
42:1642:92949:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment rate that prevails once government purchases have been adjusted to their optimal
42:1643:93042:22:22:72:277:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level. This graph is constructed using (21).
42:1644:93086:22:21:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The numerical application illustrates all the theoretical results obtained in the previous sections.
42:1645:93186:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In addition, it provides orders of magnitude for the optimal response of government purchases to a
42:1646:93284:22:22:72:394:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:realistic increase in unemployment. Several observations stand out.
42:1647:93351:22:22:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A first observation is that even with a small multiplier of 0.2, government purchases should
42:1648:93443:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increase  significantly  above  the  Samuelson  level  in  response  to  the  increase  in  unemployment
42:1649:93547:21:22:72:539:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from 6% to 9%. Withε=0.5, government purchases should increase by 1.5 percentage points of
42:1650:93637:22:19:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:GDP toG/Y=18.0%.  Forε=1, they should increase by 2.8 points of GDP toG/Y=19.3%.
42:1651:93717:19:15:82:539:125:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:24If the utility function is not separable, the unemployment and output multipliers are not exactly the same because
42:1652:93833:15:9:72:501:110:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:dk/dg6=0 (see equation (29) withτL=0). But they are close as long as the effect of g on∂U/∂cis small.

43:1676:94371:14:12:72:540:512:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:Notes:In 2008:Q3 in the United States, the unemployment rate wasu=6% and government purchases wereG/Y=
43:1677:94473:12:12:72:539:500:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:16.5%. We consider that the labor market was efficient and government purchases were optimal in 2008:Q3. The Great
43:1678:94587:12:12:72:540:488:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Recession shock hit the US economy around that time. The unemployment rate was projected to increase to 9% after
43:1679:94699:12:12:72:540:476:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the shock. The graph on the left displays the optimal response of government purchases, expressed as a share of output,
43:1680:94818:12:12:72:540:464:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:after the shock. The optimal response is computed using (20),u∗=6%,(G/Y)∗=16.5%,u0=9%,η=0.6,εequal
43:1681:94916:12:12:71:539:452:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to 0.5, 1, and 2,M0between 0 and 2, and the facts thatM0andm0are linked by (36) andG/Y=G/C/(1+G/C). The
43:1682:95019:12:12:71:539:440:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:graph on the right displays the unemployment rate once government purchases are set optimally. The unemployment
43:1683:95130:12:34:71:285:428:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:rate is computed using (21) with the same calibration.
43:1684:95184:34:22:71:540:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:And forε=2, they should increase by 4.6 points of GDP toG/Y=21.1%.  Thus, the optimal
43:1685:95269:22:22:71:390:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level of stimulus spending is quite large even for small multipliers.
43:1686:95338:22:21:89:539:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A second observation is that the unemployment multiplier that warrants the largest increase in
43:1687:95432:21:22:71:540:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:government purchases is fairly modest. Withε=0.5, the largest increase is 2.6 percentage points
43:1688:95527:22:22:71:539:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of GDP and it occurs with a multiplier of 0.6. Withε=1, the largest increase is 3.6 points of GDP
43:1689:95624:22:21:71:540:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and it occurs with a multiplier of 0.4. And withε=2, the largest increase is 5 points of GDP and
43:1690:95720:21:22:71:228:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:it occurs with a multiplier of 0.3.
43:1691:95755:22:22:89:539:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A third observation is that optimal government purchases are the same for small and large mul-
43:1692:95849:22:21:71:540:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tipliers.  For instance, fixε=1.  The optimal increase in government purchases is the same for
43:1693:95943:21:22:71:539:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multipliers of 0.12 and 1.5—1.9 points of GDP. The optimal increase in government purchases is
43:1694:96037:22:22:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:also the same for multipliers of 0.08 and 2—1.3 points of GDP. Of course the resulting unemploy-
43:1695:96133:22:21:71:539:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment rates are very different. The optimal policy fills a much larger portion of the unemployment
43:1696:96230:21:22:71:200:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gap with a large multiplier.
43:1697:96258:22:22:89:539:112:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A fourth observation is that, even though government purchases increase significantly for small
43:1698:96353:22:0:71:539:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multipliers, the unemployment rate barely falls below its initial level of 9%.  With the multiplier
44:1699:96454:0:22:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of 0.2, the unemployment rate only falls to 8.7% withε=0.5, to 8.5% withε=1, and to 8.1%
44:1700:96542:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:withε=2. Unemployment does not fall much because government purchases have little effect on
44:1701:96633:22:21:72:283:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment when the multiplier is small.
44:1702:96675:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A fifth observation is that, with a multiplier above 1, the stabilization of the unemployment
44:1703:96768:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rate is almost perfect.  With a multiplier of 1, the unemployment rate achieved with the optimal
44:1704:96864:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:policy is below 6.8%, so the remaining unemployment gap is less than 0.8 percentage points. With
44:1705:96960:21:22:72:480:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a multiplier of 2, the remaining unemployment gap is less than 0.2 percentage points.
44:1706:97045:22:22:89:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A last observation is the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption,ε,
44:1707:97139:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:plays a significant role for small to medium multipliers but not for large multipliers. Consider first
44:1708:97241:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a multiplier to 0.4. Withε=0.5, government purchases should increase by 2.4 percentage points
44:1709:97334:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of GDP. Withε=1, government purchases should increase by an additional 1.2 points of GDP.
44:1710:97423:22:21:71:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:And withε=2, government purchases should increase by yet another 1.2 points of GDP. Hence,
44:1711:97513:21:22:71:540:448:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:εsignificantly influences the optimal response of government purchases to unemployment fluctu-
44:1712:97607:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ations.  On the other hand, for a multiplier above 1, the optimal levels of government purchases
44:1713:97703:22:21:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:forε=0.5,ε=1, andε=2 are nearly indistinguishable.  This is because the optimal policy is
44:1714:97792:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:broadly to fill the unemployment gap for large multipliers, so the elasticity of substitution has little
44:1715:97896:22:45:71:267:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:influence on the optimal policy response.

44:1717:97952:34:21:71:539:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This section simulates the matching model with land described in Section2.  The model is cal-
44:1718:98045:21:22:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ibrated to US data.  The section serves several purposes.  First, it relates the sufficient statistics
44:1719:98147:22:22:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the formulas, especially the unemployment multiplier, to parameters of the model.  Second, it
44:1720:98243:22:21:71:539:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:demonstrates that the matching model provides a good description of the business cycle:  in re-
44:1721:98338:21:22:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sponse to aggregate demand shocks, the model generates realistic countercyclical fluctuations in
44:1722:98434:22:22:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the unemployment rate and unemployment multiplier. Third, it confirms that the explicit formula,
44:1723:98530:22:21:71:419:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:given by (20), is accurate even for sizable fluctuations in unemployment.
44:1724:98603:21:0:89:539:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We begin by specifying the utility function and price mechanism used in the simulations.  We

45:1739:98978:22:22:89:539:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We use a price mechanism that extends the efficient price mechanism to match empirical evi-
45:1740:99069:22:21:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dence on unemployment fluctuations and the unemployment multiplier. The efficient price mech-

47:1841:103661:14:12:72:540:344:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f4:Notes:The simulation model is a general-equilibrium matching model with land, described in Section7. The model is
47:1842:103774:12:12:72:539:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:calibrated inAppendix E. The business cycle is generated by varying the level of aggregate demand. A low aggregate
47:1843:103888:12:12:72:540:320:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:demand level means a high marginal utility of holding land or a low time discount factor. The simulations compare an
47:1844:104004:12:12:72:539:308:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:economy where government purchases are constant atG/Y=16.5% to an economy where government purchases are
47:1845:104108:12:12:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:set optimally using formula (12). In the top right graph, the unemployment multiplier is the empirical unemployment
47:1846:104223:12:12:72:540:284:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:multiplier defined by (32).  In the bottom right graph, the solid green line displays the government purchases given
47:1847:104339:12:34:72:277:272:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:by (20) and the dashed red line those given by (12).
47:1848:104391:34:21:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capacity so the matching process is congested by sellers of services.  Hence, an increase in gov-
47:1849:104488:21:22:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ernment purchases has very little effect on other buyers of services.  Crowding out of household
47:1850:104584:22:22:72:461:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases by government purchases is therefore weak, and the multiplier is large.
47:1851:104665:22:21:89:539:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The model is calibrated so that the unemployment rate is efficient whenα=1.  Hence, the
47:1852:104752:21:22:71:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unemployment rate is inefficiently high whenα<1 and inefficiently low whenα>1.   Since
47:1853:104838:22:22:71:539:130:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f8:the unemployment multiplier is positive, the government purchases ratio should be above(G/Y)∗
47:1854:104931:22:21:71:539:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whenα<1 and below whenα>1. Indeed, optimal government purchases is markedly counter-
47:1855:105015:21:0:71:522:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cyclical, decreasing fromG/Y=20.4% toG/Y=13.7% whenαincreases from 0.97 to 1.03.
48:1856:105097:0:22:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Unemployment  responds  to  the  adjustment  of  government  purchases  to  their  optimal  level.
48:1857:105195:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Whenα<1, optimal government purchases are higher thanG/Y=16.5% so unemployment is
48:1858:105276:22:21:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:below its original level.  For instance, atα=0.97 the unemployment rate falls by 3.8 percentage
48:1859:105371:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:points from 11.0% to 7.2%. Whenα>1, optimal government purchases are belowG/Y=16.5%
48:1860:105454:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:so unemployment is above its original level.  For instance,  atα=1.03 the unemployment rate
48:1861:105545:22:21:72:328:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increases by 0.8 percentage point from 4.4% to 5.2%.
48:1862:105597:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, the simulations show that the explicit formula, given by (20), is quite accurate.  For-
48:1863:105693:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mula (20) is valid up to a second-order remainder.  Since the unemployment rate displays large
48:1864:105787:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fluctuations, there is a risk that the remainder is large and the approximation given by the formula
48:1865:105887:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inaccurate. In our simulations, however, this does not happen. The government purchases obtained
48:1866:105983:22:22:72:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with the approximate explicit formula and the exact formula are close. Atα=1, the two formulas
48:1867:106077:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gives the sameG/Y. Whenαis further away from 1, the approximation remains satisfactory. The
48:1868:106168:21:22:71:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:deviation between exact and explicit formula is always below one percentage point: atα=1.03,
48:1869:106260:22:22:71:540:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the exact formula givesG/Y=13.7% while the explicit formula givesG/Y=14.6%; atα=0.97,

48:1872:106434:33:22:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This paper presents a simplified theory of optimal government purchases.  The theory clarifies a
48:1873:106530:22:22:72:456:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of existing ideas about the use of government spending for stabilization.
48:1874:106610:22:21:89:539:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A first idea is that stimulus spending in slumps is desirable if the output multiplier is above one
48:1875:106709:21:22:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(as in traditional Keynesian models). Indeed, with an output multiplier above one, public consump-
48:1876:106807:22:22:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion crowds in private consumption, so additional public consumption improves welfare.  While
48:1877:106900:22:21:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:crowding in is obviously a sufficient condition to justify stimulus spending, it is absolutely not a
48:1878:107000:21:22:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:necessary condition.  In our theory, public consumption always crowds out private consumption;
48:1879:107094:22:22:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nevertheless, stimulus spending is desirable in slumps whenever the unemployment multiplier is
48:1880:107188:22:21:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive—so that an increase in government spending reduces the unemployment rate. This result
48:1881:107282:21:22:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:holds both whether taxes are distortionary or not.  Since available estimates of the unemployment
48:1882:107379:22:22:72:436:109:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier are positive, stimulus spending is likely to be desirable in slumps.
48:1883:107458:22:0:89:539:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A concern of stimulus skeptics is that multipliers are estimated using deficit-financed increases
49:1884:107557:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in  government  purchases,  not  balanced-budget  increases,  and  that  balanced-budget  and  deficit-
49:1885:107660:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:financed multipliers may have opposite sign.  For instance, Barro and Redlick (2011) find in US
49:1886:107755:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:data that the deficit-financed output multiplier is positive but the balanced-budget output multi-
49:1887:107853:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:plier is negative. The mechanism is that higher government purchases require higher distortionary
49:1888:107950:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:taxes, which depress output through negative labor-supply responses.  Our theory alleviates this
49:1889:108046:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concern, however.  It is not the output multiplier but the unemployment multiplier that should be
49:1890:108143:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:used to design optimal stimulus spending. While the output multiplier is smaller and can become
49:1891:108238:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:negative once tax distortions are taken into account, the unemployment multiplier is larger once
49:1892:108334:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tax distortions are taken into account.  This is because a reduction in labor supply leads to lower
49:1893:108433:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output but higher tightness and lower unemployment in the matching model (Michaillat and Saez
49:1894:108526:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2015).  In fact, the unemployment multiplier equals the output multiplier net of the labor-supply
49:1895:108623:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:responses due to distortionary taxation.  With strong negative labor-supply responses, a negative
49:1896:108720:21:22:72:409:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:output multiplier can coexist with a positive unemployment multiplier.
49:1897:108790:22:22:89:539:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our theory also links the optimal level of stimulus spending to the size of the unemployment
49:1898:108882:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier.  Stimulus skeptics usually believe in small multipliers and infer that stimulus spending
49:1899:108982:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should be small or zero in slumps. On the other hand, stimulus advocates usually believe in large
49:1900:109079:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multipliers and infer that stimulus spending should be large in slumps.  In fact, our theory shows
49:1901:109177:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that the relationship between the optimal level of stimulus spending and the size of the unemploy-
49:1902:109275:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment multiplier is hump-shaped. In a US calibration, the relationship peaks for an unemployment
49:1903:109370:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:multiplier of 0.4. So a multiplier of 0.4 calls for the highest level of stimulus spending. Higher and
49:1904:109472:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower multipliers warrant smaller levels, such that the optimal level of stimulus spending is similar
49:1905:109573:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for small and large multipliers.  For instance, in our US calibration, the optimal level of stimulus
49:1906:109673:22:22:72:390:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spending is the same for unemployment multipliers of 0.1 and 1.8.
49:1907:109738:22:22:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Next, our theory links the optimal level of stimulus spending to the usefulness of additional
49:1908:109831:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public spending.  A concern of stimulus skeptics is that additional government spending could be
49:1909:109927:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:wasteful.   Our theory develops this argument.   It is true that when the elasticity of substitution
49:1910:110027:22:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between  public  and  private  consumption  is  zero,  so  that  additional  public  workers  dig  and  fill
49:1911:110135:22:21:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:holes in the ground, government purchases should remain at the Samuelson level and not be used
49:1912:110229:21:22:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for stabilization. But in the more realistic case where the elasticity of substitution is positive, some
49:1913:110333:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stimulus spending is desirable in slumps.  We also qualify the view of stimulus advocates in the
50:1914:110431:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Keynesian tradition who argue that government purchases should entirely fill the unemployment
50:1915:110524:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gap, irrespective of the usefulness of additional public spending. It is true that when the elasticity
50:1916:110626:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of substitution is infinite, so that public and private consumption are perfect substitute, government
50:1917:110728:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:purchases should completely fill the unemployment gap.  But in the more realistic case where the
50:1918:110824:22:22:72:517:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:elasticity is finite, government purchases fill the unemployment gap partially, not completely.
50:1919:110919:22:21:89:539:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Overall,  government  purchases  could  contribute  to  stabilization  whenever  monetary  policy
50:1920:111016:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is constrained.   This situation arises when the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate is
50:1921:111113:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:binding—for instance, in the United States, Japan, and the European Union in the aftermath of the
50:1922:111210:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Great Recession. This situation also applies to members of a monetary union, which have no con-
50:1923:111305:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trol over monetary policy but can tailor government purchases and taxes to local conditions—for
50:1924:111400:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:instance, a country in the eurozone or a state in the United States. Furthermore, since it focuses on
50:1925:111501:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:budget-balanced government purchases, our theory is particularly appropriate for US states, which
50:1926:111598:21:36:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cannot run budget deficits, and eurozone countries, which face strict limits on their budget deficits.

54:2070:121586:26:15:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the analysis, we abstract from transitional dynamics for the unemployment rate and output.  In
54:2071:121683:15:14:72:540:666:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this appendix we use labor market data for the US to validate this approximation.  We show that
54:2072:121778:14:15:72:389:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the transitional dynamics of the unemployment rate are negligible.
54:2073:121844:15:14:89:540:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We begin by constructing a time series for the selling rateft.  We measure one unit of service
54:2074:121938:14:15:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by one job, so that the selling rate is a job-finding rate. We assume that unemployed workers find a
54:2075:122038:15:14:72:539:608:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:job according to a Poisson process with arrival rateft. Thus, the monthly job-finding rate satisfies
54:2076:122138:14:14:73:539:594:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:ft=−ln(1−Ft), whereFtis the monthly job-finding probability.  We construct a time series for
54:2077:122230:14:33:72:444:580:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:Ftfollowing the method developed by Shimer (2012). We use the relationship

54:2087:122777:15:14:72:159:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and is procyclical.
54:2088:122796:14:15:89:539:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Next, we construct the separation rate following the method developed byShimer(2012). The

54:2101:123242:14:15:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Panel B, displays the monthly separation rate for 1951–2014.  The separation rate averages 3.3%
54:2102:123337:15:14:71:197:295:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:and is broadly acyclical.27

54:2108:123465:32:14:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The two series, displayed in Panel C of Figure A1, are almost identical.  This finding implies that
54:2109:123564:14:37:71:431:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the transitional dynamics of the actual unemployment rate are unimportant.
54:2110:123638:37:15:82:539:169:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:27One concern is that increases in government purchases cannot be undone because jobs created by the government
54:2111:123749:15:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:are effectively permanent.  It is true that government jobs separate more slowly than private jobs.  Using data con-
54:2112:123865:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:structed by the BLS from the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey for 2000–2014, we find that the average monthly
54:2113:123979:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:separation rate is 3.9% for private jobs and 1.4% for government jobs.  Nevertheless, the separation rate for govern-
54:2114:124096:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ment jobs remains sizable. If no new jobs were created by the government, the level of government purchases would
54:2115:124209:12:12:72:539:106:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:rapidly decrease. Indeed, with a hiring freeze, US government employment would fall by 1−exp(−0.014·12) =15%
54:2116:124317:12:0:72:118:94:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in one year.

55:2146:125029:12:12:71:539:197:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:rate is the quarterly average of the seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate constructed by the BLS from the

55:2148:125252:12:12:71:539:173:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Panel C is similar to Figure 1 inHall(2005).  Although we use different measures of the job-finding and separation
55:2149:125366:12:12:71:539:161:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:rates  and  a  longer  time  period,  Hall’s  conclusion  remains  valid:  transitional  dynamics  are  irrelevant  on  the  labor

55:2151:125601:35:27:80:531:114:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:Appendix B.  Demand Structure and Price Mechanism: Other Examples
55:2152:125666:27:14:71:539:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this appendix we present three other examples of demand structure and price mechanism for the
55:2153:125762:14:0:71:540:73:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:matching model of Section2. These examples yield the same equilibrium structure as the example
56:2154:125858:0:15:72:229:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with land described in Section 2.
56:2155:125891:15:14:89:539:693:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:First, the variablel(t)in the land model can be interpreted as a generic unproduced good, as in
56:2156:125986:14:15:71:477:679:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Hart (1982). It could also be interpreted as a specific unproduced good, such as gold.
56:2157:126072:15:14:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Second, the land model could be slightly modified by replacing land by money and assuming
56:2158:126161:14:15:71:539:650:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that households derive utility from holding real money balances.  Introducing money in the utility
56:2159:126259:15:14:71:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function is a classical way to generate an aggregate demand.  FollowingSidrauski(1967), a large
56:2160:126354:14:15:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of business-cycle models with money in the utility function have been developed.  Two
56:2161:126446:15:14:72:539:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:prominent examples areBarro and Grossman(1971) andBlanchard and Kiyotaki(1987).  Money
56:2162:126532:14:14:72:531:592:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is introduced in the utility function to capture the fact that money helps conducting transactions.
56:2163:126631:14:15:89:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the money model, a household holdsM(t)units of money and the supply of money is fixed
56:2164:126719:15:14:71:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:atM0.  In equilibrium, the money market clears andM(t) =M0.  The price of services in terms of
56:2165:126813:14:15:72:539:549:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:money isp(t). We specify a general price mechanism that determines the price of services:p(t) =
56:2166:126908:15:14:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:p(g(t)).   The household’s instantaneous utility function isU(c(t),g(t)) +V(M(t)/p(t)).   The
56:2167:127001:14:15:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:law of motion of the household’s real money balancesm(t)≡M(t)/p(t)is   ̇m(t) = (1−u(x(t)))·
56:2168:127092:15:14:71:540:505:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:k−(1+τ(x(t)))·c(t)−π(t)·m(t)−T(t), whereπ(t)≡ ̇p(t)/p(t)is the inflation rate.  In steady
56:2169:127181:14:15:72:539:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:state,gand thuspare fixed so inflation is zero. The equilibrium immediately converges to steady
56:2170:127276:15:14:72:539:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:state.  In steady state the desired private consumptionc(x,p,g)is given by∂U/∂c= (1+τ(x))·
56:2171:127366:14:14:72:512:462:12:g_d0_f25:12:g_d0_f4:V′(M0/p)/δ. Equilibrium tightnessx(g)is implicitly defined byc(x,g,p(g))+g=y(x,k).
56:2172:127448:14:15:89:539:448:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Third,  the  land  model  could  be  slightly  modified  by  replacing  land  by  nominal  bonds  and
56:2173:127549:15:14:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assuming that households derive utility from holding real bonds.  Introducing bonds in the utility
56:2174:127647:14:15:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function is a simple way to generate an aggregate demand in a dynamic economy. It is especially
56:2175:127742:15:14:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:adapted to modern, cashless macroeconomic models. The assumption that wealth enters the utility
56:2176:127837:14:15:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:function has been used in growth models (Kurz 1968;Zou 1994), microeconomic models (Robson
56:2177:127927:15:14:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:1992;Cole, Mailath and Postlewaite 1995), life-cycle models (Carroll 2000;Francis 2009), asset-
56:2178:128022:14:15:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:pricing models (Bakshi and Chen 1996;Gong and Zou 2002), business-cycle models (Michaillat
56:2179:128112:15:14:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Saez 2014;Ono and Yamada 2014), and public-economics models (Saez and Stantcheva 2016).
56:2180:128203:14:14:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Wealth is introduced in the utility function to capture the fact that people care about wealth not

56:2182:128398:15:14:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:wealth provides high social status; high wealth provides political power; people value frugality and
56:2183:128498:14:15:72:514:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:asceticism and thus dignify the accumulation of wealth; or people value bequeathing wealth.
56:2184:128589:15:14:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the bond model, bonds are issued and purchased by households, and they have a price of 1
56:2185:128680:14:15:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in terms of money. Money only plays the role of a unit of account. A household holdsB(t)bonds
56:2186:128773:15:14:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and bonds are in zero net supply.  In equilibrium, the bond market clears andB(t) =0.  The rate
56:2187:128868:14:15:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of return on bonds is the nominal interest ratei(t). The nominal interest rate is determined by the
56:2188:128967:15:14:72:539:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:central bank, which sets an interest ratei(t) =i(g(t)).  We allow the interest rate to depend on
56:2189:129063:14:15:72:468:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:public consumption to allow for an interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.
56:2190:129145:15:14:89:539:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The price of services in terms of money isp(t).   The inflation rate isπ(t)≡ ̇p(t)/p(t).   In
56:2191:129238:14:14:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the economy there are two goods—services and bonds—and hence one relative price (public and
56:2192:129329:14:15:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:private services have the same price). The price of bonds relative to services is determined by the
56:2193:129428:15:14:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:real interest rate,i(t)−π(t). Since the nominal interest rate is determined by the central bank, it is
56:2194:129530:14:15:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the inflation rate that determines the real interest rate. The inflation rate is determined by a general
56:2195:129634:15:14:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:price mechanism:π(t) =π(g(t)).  Given the inflation rate, the price of services moves according
56:2196:129729:14:15:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to   ̇p(t) =π(t)·p(t).  The initial pricep(0)is given.  Given the inflation rate and nominal interest
56:2197:129830:15:14:72:460:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rate, tightness adjusts such that supply equals demand on the market for services.
56:2198:129912:14:0:89:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The household’s instantaneous utility function isU(c(t),g(t)) +V(B(t)/p(t)).  The law of

57:2201:130184:14:15:72:539:679:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:In  steady  state,  the  desired  amount  of  private  consumptionc(x,i,π,g)is  given  by∂U/∂c=

57:2205:130564:14:15:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The equation implies that at the margin, the household is indifferent between consuming and hold-

59:2435:134086:26:15:71:540:362:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this appendix we calibrate the simulation model of Section7 based on empirical evidence for
59:2436:134180:15:14:71:489:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the United States. The values of the calibrated parameters are summarized in TableA1.
59:2437:134265:14:15:89:539:333:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We begin by calibrating the utility function.   We arbitrarily set the elasticity of substitution
59:2438:134362:15:14:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f9:between public and private consumption toε=1.  As showed inAppendix C, the parameterγ
59:2439:134447:14:15:71:539:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:determines the Samuelson level of government purchases:(G/C)∗=γ/(1−γ).  We assume that
59:2440:134533:15:14:71:539:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the Samuelson level of government purchases is the average level of government purchases in the
59:2441:134628:14:15:71:505:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:United States for 1990–2014:(G/C)∗=19.7% (see Section6). We therefore setγ=0.16.
59:2442:134708:15:14:89:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Then  we  calibrate  the  matching  parameters.   We  use  the  estimates  ofsandηobtained  by
59:2443:134802:14:14:71:539:246:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Landais, Michaillat and Saez(2015) using US labor market data for 1990–2014:s=2.8% and
59:2444:134888:14:15:71:539:232:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:η=0.6. To calibrate the matching efficacy, we exploit the relationshipu·f(x) =s·(1−u), which
59:2445:134980:15:14:71:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:impliesω=s·xη−1·(1−u)/u. The average unemployment rate and tightness in US labor market
59:2446:135067:14:15:71:540:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:data for 1990–2014 areu=6.1% andx=0.43 (Landais, Michaillat and Saez 2015). Using these
59:2447:135154:15:14:71:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average values, we obtainω=0.60.  To calibrate the matching cost, we exploit the relationship
59:2448:135247:14:15:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:τ=ρ·s/[ω·x−η−ρ·s], which impliesρ=ω·x−η·τ/[s·(1+τ)].  This relationship holds for
59:2449:135328:15:14:71:540:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:anyτandx, in particular when tightness is efficient sox=x∗andτ=τ∗.  We assume that the
59:2450:135414:14:15:71:539:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:efficient unemployment rate and tightness are the average US unemployment rate and tightness
59:2451:135506:15:14:71:540:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for 1990–2014:u∗=6.1% andx∗=0.43.   When tightness is efficient,τ∗=u∗·(1−η)/ηso
59:2452:135585:14:14:71:503:116:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:τ∗=4.1%. Pluggingx∗=0.43 andτ∗=4.1% in the expression forρ, we obtainρ=1.4.
59:2453:135660:14:15:89:539:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Last, we calibrate the price mechanism. The empirical evidence suggest that on average in the
59:2454:135753:15:14:71:540:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:United States the unemployment multiplier isM=0.5 (see Section6).  Relying on (38), we set
59:2455:135843:14:0:71:539:73:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:r1=0.46 to matchM=0.5.  We calibrate the price level such that when the aggregate demand
60:2456:135933:0:15:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:parameter,α≡δ/V′(l0), equals 1 andG/C= (G/C)∗=19.7%, thenu=u∗=6.1%. Using (37),
60:2457:136012:15:36:72:182:693:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we find thatp0=0.78.
