2:28:1255:29:14:71:538:573:12:Times:12:Times:F:There has been a widespread displacement of coal by natural gas as space heating and cooking 
2:29:1348:14:14:71:538:559:12:Times:12:Times:F:technology in  Turkey  in  the  last  two  decades,  triggered  by  the  deployment  of  natural  gas 
2:30:1449:14:14:71:538:545:12:Times:12:Times:F:networks. In this paper, we examine the impact of this development on mortality among adults 
2:31:1541:14:14:71:538:531:12:Times:12:Times:F:and the elderly. Our research design exploits the variation in the timing of the deployment and 
2:32:1636:14:14:71:538:517:12:Times:12:Times:F:the intensity of expansion of natural gas networks at the provincial level using data from 2001 to 
2:33:1734:14:14:71:538:503:12:Times:12:Times:F:2014.  The  results  indicate  that  the  expansion of  natural  gas  services  has  caused  significant 
2:34:1838:14:14:71:538:489:12:Times:12:Times:F:reductions in both the adult and the elderly mortality rates. According to our point estimates, a 
2:35:1935:14:14:71:538:475:12:Times:12:Times:F:one-percentage point increase in the rate of subscriptions to natural gas services would lower the 
2:36:2033:14:14:71:538:461:12:Times:12:Times:F:overall  mortality  rate  by  1.4  percent,  the  adult  mortality  rate by  1.9  percent,  and  the  elderly 
2:37:2142:14:14:71:538:447:12:Times:12:Times:F:mortality  rate  by  1.2  percent.  These  findings  are  supported  by  our  auxiliary analysis,  which 
2:38:2246:14:14:71:538:433:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:F:demonstrates  that  the  expansion  of  natural  gas  networks  has  indeed  led  to  a  significant 
2:39:2346:14:14:71:538:419:12:Times:12:Times:F:improvement in air quality. Furthermore, we show that the mortality gains for both the adult and 
2:40:2443:14:14:71:538:405:12:Times:12:Times:F:the elderly  populations  are  primarily  driven  by  reductions  in  cardio-respiratory  deaths,  which 
2:41:2547:14:14:71:538:391:12:Times:12:Times:F:are  more likely  to  be  due  to  conditions  caused  or  exacerbated  by  air  pollution.  Finally,  our 
2:42:2653:14:14:71:538:377:12:Times:12:Times:F:analysis does not reveal any important gender differences in the estimated relationship between 
2:43:2748:14:47:71:331:363:12:Times:12:Times:F:the deployment of natural gas networks and mortality.

3:65:3192:0:27:72:148:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:I. Introduction
3:66:3207:27:27:108:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:C:The recent emergence of natural gas as an abundant, efficient, and relatively inexpensive 
3:67:3297:27:28:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:source of fuel has been transforming the world energy landscape. The new discoveries of large 
3:68:3391:28:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas fields and technological innovations in drilling, such as hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), 
3:69:3490:28:27:72:496:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:are unlocking massive reserves of natural gas and threatening the position of coal as the 
3:70:3580:27:28:72:524:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:dominant source of energy in many parts of the world. Natural gas is now the fastest-growing 
3:71:3673:28:28:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:fossil fuel, with an annual growth rate of 1.9 percent, while coal is the slowest-growing fuel and 
3:72:3772:28:27:72:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:is projected to be surpassed by natural gas by 2030 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 
3:73:3865:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:2016). As a result of these developments, the average carbon intensity (CO2 per unit of energy) 
3:74:3961:28:27:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the global energy supply has started to decline as CO2 emissions from the combustion of 
3:75:4052:27:28:72:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas are about half as much as those from the burning of coal.1 In fact, the combustion of 
3:76:4150:28:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas results in much lower emissions of nearly all types of pollutants (Knittel et al., 
3:77:4245:28:27:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:2015).2 Furthermore, natural gas requires limited processing to prepare it for end use, which 
3:78:4339:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:makes it ideal for the purposes of domestic and commercial space heating.  As a result of these 
3:79:4435:28:27:72:500:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:qualities, some experts view the ongoing replacement of coal by natural gas as a positive 
3:80:4525:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:development, which could be leveraged as a common sense approach to address the problem of 
3:81:4616:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:global carbon emissions in the near- to mid-term, even if it cannot be the sole basis for efforts to 
3:82:4717:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:achieving a completely renewable future long-term energy landscape (Brown et al., 2009; Center 
3:83:4812:27:61:72:428:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2013; Levi, 2013; Moniz et al., 2011).  
3:84:4886:61:16:72:526:151:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 It is important to note that total CO2 emissions continue to rise despite the decrease in carbon intensity. But it is 
3:85:5006:16:12:72:518:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:projected that the share of coal in overall fuel consumption would fall from 28 percent in 2012 to 22 percent in 
3:86:5119:12:11:72:532:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:2040, while that of natural gas would rise from 23 percent to 26 percent (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 
3:87:5233:11:7:72:99:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:2016). 
3:88:5239:7:16:72:520:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 For example, natural gas virtually emits no sulfur oxides and particulates, and it releases about one-fifth of the 
3:89:5356:16:0:72:415:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:nitrogen oxides released by coal. See http://www.c2es.org/energy/source/natural-g as. 
4:90:5442:0:28:108:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:C:While many developed countries have enacted environmental policies and regulations, 
4:91:5526:28:27:72:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and established effective monitoring systems to reduce carbon emissions, the progress in the 
4:92:5619:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing world has been relatively stagnant because there are barriers to effective enforcement 
4:93:5717:28:28:71:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of regulations due to weak governance and corruption (Cesur et al., 2016; Greenstone and 
4:94:5806:28:27:71:509:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hanna, 2014; Jayachandran, 2009). Environmental concerns are also overshadowed by the 
4:95:5892:27:28:71:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressure that governments in these countries are facing in order to maintain robust economic 
4:96:5985:28:28:71:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth.  As a result, heavy reliance on coal continues and a full-scale transition to cost-effective, 
4:97:6087:28:27:71:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:carbon-free energy alternatives are unlikely to develop in the near-term. Therefore, the potential 
4:98:6186:27:28:71:501:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:for natural gas to mitigate climate change and reduce air pollution could particularly be a 
4:99:6278:28:27:71:307:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:promising prospect for the developing countries. 
4:100:6327:27:28:107:511:433:144:Times:144:Times:C:Against this backdrop, an important question to consider is whether a technological 
4:101:6411:28:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:development that led to a displacement of coal by natural gas would have an influence on public 
4:102:6507:28:27:71:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:health. If natural gas indeed possesses the aforementioned qualities, then it is plausible to ask 
4:103:6605:27:28:71:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether policies facilitating the expansion of natural gas infrastructure for commercial and 
4:104:6698:28:27:71:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:residential applications translate into subsequent improvements in public health. This is a 
4:105:6790:27:28:71:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:critically important question because ambient air pollution caused by carbon emissions is 
4:106:6880:28:28:71:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:recognized as the most serious environmental risk to public health causing 3.7 million deaths 
4:107:6974:28:27:71:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:worldwide – 6.7 percent of all deaths – annually.3 It is estimated that about 16 percent of the 
4:108:7070:27:28:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:lung cancer deaths, 11 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease deaths, more than 20 
4:109:7163:28:27:72:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of ischemic heart disease and stroke deaths, and about 13 percent of respiratory infection 
4:110:7262:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:deaths are caused by air pollution. Therefore, it is important to understand whether the expanded 
4:111:7360:28:28:71:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:use of natural gas as a replacement to coal could save some of these lives, at least until carbon-

5:114:7583:0:28:72:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:free energy alternatives become widely available. This paper seeks to inform this question by 
5:115:7677:28:27:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessing the impact of a large scale deployment of natural gas networks on public health in the 
5:116:7774:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:context of a developing country, namely Turkey. Turkey has begun investing in the development 
5:117:7868:28:28:72:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of a natural gas infrastructure in 1980s by expanding a grid of pipelines originating in its 
5:118:7961:28:27:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:neighbours, including Azerbaijan, Iran, and Russia. These investments have led to a widespread 
5:119:8056:27:28:72:524:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:displacement of coal by natural gas for residential and commercial space heating and cooking 
5:120:8149:28:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:purposes. Today, 71 of the 81 Turkish provinces has a natural gas infrastructure in place. By 
5:121:8243:28:27:72:535:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:exploiting the variation in the deployment of natural gas networks across Turkish provinces and 
5:122:8339:27:28:72:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time, this study provides insights into the impact of displacement of coal by natural gas on 
5:123:8437:28:27:72:205:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:adult and elderly mortality. 
5:124:8466:27:28:108:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:C:Despite all the attention paid to the natural gas revolution and its potentially profound 
5:125:8556:28:28:72:502:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications for air pollution, the influence of a nationwide adoption of natural gas as the 
5:126:8649:28:27:72:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary source of fuel on public health, particularly from the perspective of adults and the 
5:127:8742:27:28:72:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly is largely unknown. The only other investigation on this topic, Cesur et al. (2016), 
5:128:8835:28:27:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:demonstrates that a widespread displacement of coal by natural gas had a significant reduction in 
5:129:8933:27:28:71:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:infant mortality in Turkey. In the present study, we take the analysis in Cesur et al. (2016) a step 
5:130:9034:28:28:71:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:further by examining the efficacy of the deployment of natural gas networks on mortality rates 
5:131:9129:28:27:71:485:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:among adults and the elderly. This analysis is important because the potential role for 
5:132:9217:27:28:71:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments to enhance social welfare by either funding the construction of pipelines or 
5:133:9306:28:27:71:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:inducing household demand via subsidies requires a cost-benefit analysis that quantifies the 
5:134:9399:27:28:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:public health benefits associated with displacing coal by natural gas for all age groups, not only 
5:135:9498:28:28:71:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:infants. In this paper, we also assess whether any of the relationship between natural gas and 
5:136:9593:28:0:71:541:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality is gender or cause specific. There is epidemiological evidence to suggest that the health 
6:137:9694:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:risks posed by air pollution might differ by gender (e.g., Abbey et al.,1999; Chen et al., 2012; 
6:138:9791:28:27:71:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Clougherty, 2010; Dockery et al., 1993; Englert, 2004). Studies typically find effects that are 
6:139:9887:27:28:71:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:stronger for females than males, although there is no consensus in the literature. It is also unclear 
6:140:9989:28:28:71:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:to what extent these differing associations are attributable to socially-driven gender-specific 
6:141:10085:28:27:71:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences (e.g., activity patterns, smoking prevalence, and exposure) versus biological 
6:142:10175:27:28:71:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences (e.g., hormonal composition, reproductive organs, body size) (Clougherty, 2010; 
6:143:10267:28:28:71:151:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Krieger, 2003).  
6:144:10284:28:27:107:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:C:This paper also contributes to a small but growing literature on the impact of fuel 
6:145:10368:27:28:71:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:transitions and adoption of new fuel technologies. Most of the existing evidence pertaining to the 
6:146:10467:28:27:71:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of natural gas related technology adoption comes from studies that consider the potential 
6:147:10565:27:28:71:509:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact of fracking on public health outcomes of populations living near drilling sites (e.g., 
6:148:10659:28:28:71:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Adgate et al., 2014; Blamberger and Oswald, 2012; Colborn et al., 2012; Finkel and Hays, 2015; 
6:149:10754:28:27:71:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finkel and Law, 2011; Hill, 2012; Howarth et al., 2011; Osborn et al., 2011; Tuller, 2015).4 
6:150:10846:27:28:72:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, this effect is likely to be quite different from that of the displacement of coal by 
6:151:10940:28:27:72:494:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas. First and foremost, studies on fracking raise concerns over the technique of 
6:152:11030:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:extraction of natural gas and not over the choice between the combustion of natural gas versus 
6:153:11125:28:28:71:491:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:coal. To the extent that any fracking-induced decrease in the price of natural gas might 
6:154:11214:28:27:72:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially cause a reduction in coal consumption and concurrently improve overall air quality, 
6:155:11310:27:28:72:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the net health effect associated with fracking could actually be positive. Until these positive 
6:156:11406:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:externalities are fully considered, the debate over the net merit of fracking will not be settled. 
6:157:11505:27:22:72:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:Second, natural gas considered in the current context does not pose the same environmental risks 
6:158:11602:22:7:216:219:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
6:159:11655:7:16:72:529:128:42:Times:99:Times:F:4 Evidence from these studies raise the possibility of a potentially negative health impact of fracking in relation to 
6:160:11774:16:12:72:488:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:the chemicals used during the process, including seismic events, methane leaks, and underground water 
6:161:11876:12:11:72:523:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:contamination.  However, no consensus exists in the literature and there is a lack of credible evidence from well-
6:162:11990:11:0:72:356:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:designed investigations that properly account for confounding factors.  
7:163:12062:0:28:72:528:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:as in fracking because it is transmitted through pipelines that originate in wells located outside 
7:164:12161:28:27:71:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Turkey and drilled by the conventional vertical technique, which has a much smaller carbon 
7:165:12252:27:28:71:103:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:print.  
7:166:12260:28:28:107:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:C:One exception to the fracking studies that is also relevant for the present paper is a recent 
7:167:12354:28:27:71:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis by Barreca et al. (2014), who examine the effects of bituminous coal consumption for 
7:168:12448:27:28:71:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:home heating on infant and all age mortality rates in the United States during the mid-twentieth 
7:169:12545:28:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:century. The authors show that the reductions in the consumption of coal between 1945 and 1960 
7:170:12640:28:27:71:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly decreased both infant and all age mortality. The time frame considered in their 
7:171:12734:27:28:71:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis was also a period that coincides with a rapid switch away from coal towards oil and 
7:172:12827:28:27:71:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas.  This is important in terms of illustrating the potential role that a widespread 
7:173:12921:27:28:71:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:displacement of coal by cleaner sources of fuel might have played on public health in the United 
7:174:13018:28:27:71:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:States.5 While the United States and many developed countries have made inroads towards 
7:175:13106:27:28:72:501:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:cleaner fuels, the developing world continues to rely primarily on coal to meet its energy 
7:176:13197:28:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements.6 We believe that it is important to identify and highlight the impact of socially 
7:177:13293:28:27:72:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:desirable and economically viable public and market based approaches that would help natural 
7:178:13386:27:28:72:392:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas gain traction as an alternative to coal in developing countries.  
7:179:13456:28:28:108:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:C:This papers also extends the literature on the impact of air pollution on the health 
7:180:13540:28:27:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcomes of adults and the elderly. Research in economics and epidemiology has shown that 
7:181:13630:27:77:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:exposure to air pollution has adverse effects on health by causing conditions such as pulmonary 
7:182:13726:77:7:216:219:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
7:183:13779:7:16:72:522:128:42:Times:99:Times:F:5 In particular, while the share of coal as a fuel for heating purposes declined from 55 to 35 percent, the share of 
7:184:13896:16:7:72:389:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:natural gas increased by over 400 percent (see page 10 in Barreca et al., 2014). 
7:185:13976:7:16:72:538:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:6 See for example, http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/coal-is-still-integral- to-many-countries-and-regions-

8:187:14111:0:28:72:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:and systemic inflammation, accelerated atherosclerosis, heart arrhythmias, and pneumonia.7 One 
8:188:14206:28:27:72:499:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the most notable contribution of economists in this field has been the improvement of 
8:189:14295:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical strategies to obtain causal estimates of the impact of exposure to air pollution, which is 
8:190:14396:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:arguably endogenous. To highlight a few recent and notable examples, Chen et al. (2013) exploit 
8:191:14492:28:27:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Huai River policy experiment in China to examine the impact of long-term exposure to air 
8:192:14585:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:pollution on adult mortality. The authors first demonstrate that the policy, which provided free 
8:193:14682:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:coal to citizens living to the north of the Huai River but not to the south, caused a substantial rise 
8:194:14785:28:27:72:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:in total particulate matter (TSP) in the north relative to the south.  They then show that the 
8:195:14880:27:28:71:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in TSP was accompanied with a significant increase in adult mortality in the affected 
8:196:14974:28:27:71:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:regions due to the elevated rates of cardio-respiratory deaths. Anderson (2015) examines the 
8:197:15067:27:28:71:534:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact of long-term exposure to air pollution on mortality by exploiting quasi-random variation 
8:198:15163:28:28:71:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:in pollution levels generated by wind patterns near major highways in Los Angeles. He finds 
8:199:15255:28:27:72:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically and economically significant effects of downwind exposure to near-roadway 
8:200:15343:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:pollution on mortality amongst the elderly. Finally, Schlenker and Walker (2015) exploit the 
8:201:15436:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in air pollution caused by runway traffic congestion in California airports to show that 
8:202:15535:27:28:72:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased pollution levels in areas surrounding airports are associated with asthma, respiratory, 
8:203:15633:28:27:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:and heart related hospitalizations among infants, adults, and elderly population.8 It is important 
8:204:15732:27:28:72:542:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:to note that all these three papers provide estimates for the health impact of a rise in air pollution, 
8:205:15836:28:28:72:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:while the current paper considers the health effect of a development that results in a decrease in 
8:206:15934:28:37:72:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:air pollution. This distinction is important because the relationship between air pollution and 
8:207:16030:37:8:216:219:147:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
8:208:16083:8:16:72:536:139:42:Times:99:Times:F:7 For example, see Anderson (2015), Barreca et al. (2014), Chen et al. (2013), DelFino et al. (2005), Dockery et al., 
8:209:16201:16:7:72:389:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:1993; Lockwood (2012), Pope et al. (2004), and Schlenker and Walker (2015). 
8:210:16276:7:16:72:525:116:42:Times:99:Times:F:8 Both Chen et al. (2013) and Anderson (2015) focus on the health impact of long-term exposure to air pollution, 
8:211:16389:16:11:72:536:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:Schlenker and Walker (2015) consider day-to-day fluctuations, which results in estimates for the short-run effect of 
8:212:16506:11:0:71:339:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:air pollution on health rather than the long-run cumulative impact. 
9:213:16575:0:28:72:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality needs not be symmetrical. This is especially likely to be true for an outcome like 
9:214:16668:28:27:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality that is irreversible. Furthermore, health problems caused by air pollution usually 
9:215:16761:27:28:72:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:become chronic (e.g., heart and lung disease) and chronic conditions are not easily reversible 
9:216:16856:28:28:72:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:when air quality is improved. Additionally, any health benefits attributable to improved air 
9:217:16949:28:27:72:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality may be felt over time rather than being realized immediately, especially for adults and the 
9:218:17049:27:28:72:526:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly for whom most deaths are likely due to chronic conditions. In this paper, we recognize 
9:219:17144:28:28:72:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:this issue by specifying a treatment variable that captures a dose-effect relationship rather a 
9:220:17240:28:27:71:392:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:binary treatment approach adopted in most of the extant literature. 
9:221:17308:27:28:107:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:C:The research design in our study exploits the variation in the intensity of natural gas 
9:222:17396:28:27:71:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumption, as measured by the number of subscribers to natural gas services per 100 persons, 
9:223:17491:27:28:71:519:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:across Turkish provinces and over time. Our results indicate that the displacement of coal by 
9:224:17585:28:28:71:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas induced by the deployment of natural gas networks has resulted in a significant 
9:225:17677:28:27:72:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvement in air quality, which then caused mortality rate among adults and the elderly to 
9:226:17770:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:decrease significantly. According to our point estimates, a one-percentage point increase in the 
9:227:17867:28:27:72:504:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensity of natural gas consumption results in 1.9 and 1.2 percent decrease in the rates of 
9:228:17960:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality among adults and the elderly, respectively.  Furthermore, these mortality gains appear 
9:229:18056:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:to be almost exclusively driven by decreases in deaths due to cardio-respiratory conditions. This 
9:230:18154:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:is not surprising since adult and elderly deaths are closely related to chronic disease conditions, 
9:231:18254:27:28:72:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:which are likely to be exacerbated by air pollution. Finally, we find no evidence of meaningful 
9:232:18350:28:28:72:303:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:differential effects between males and females.

9:234:18399:27:0:72:154:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:II. Background 
10:235:18415:0:28:108:510:709:144:Times:144:Times:C: The developments that have led to the deployment of a natural gas infrastructure in 
10:236:18499:28:27:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Turkey have been discussed in detail in Cesur et al. (2016).  Essentially, the rationale behind the 
10:237:18599:27:28:72:520:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:country’s decision to make massive investments on a network of natural gas pipelines was to 
10:238:18691:28:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:diversify its energy portfolio and thereby reduce its vulnerability to global supply shortages in 
10:239:18789:28:27:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:oil.  Natural gas was identified as the most economically and technologically feasible candidate 
10:240:18886:27:28:72:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:to add to its energy mix, given Turkey’s close proximity to some of the world’s largest natural 
10:241:18982:28:28:72:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas producers such as Azerbaijan, Iran, and Russia. Importantly for the purpose of the present 
10:242:19077:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:study, there is no evidence that improving public health was among the factors that played a role 
10:243:19175:27:28:72:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the decision to deploy natural gas networks. First deployed in Ankara in 1988, natural gas 
10:244:19269:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks spread gradually across Turkey over time and reached to 71 of the 81 provinces by 
10:245:19360:27:28:72:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:2014. Natural gas is imported from Azerbaijan, Iran, and Russia through pipelines that are 
10:246:19451:28:27:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:operated by a state owned company called Botas.9 The gas is then transmitted to individual 
10:247:19542:27:28:72:510:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces by privately owned distribution companies that are responsible for providing the 
10:248:19633:28:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:public with clean burning natural gas by establishing and operating all infrastructural facilities 
10:249:19732:28:27:72:238:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the utilization of natural gas.10 
10:250:19769:27:28:108:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:C:The deployment of natural gas networks has led to a rapid increase in the consumption of 
10:251:19858:28:28:72:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas for domestic heating and cooking purposes, while the pace of increase in coal 
10:252:19948:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumption has been much slower.  For example, between the years of 2000 and 2010, the total 
10:253:20042:27:19:72:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumption of coal and peat increased from 11 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to 14 
10:254:20133:19:8:216:219:193:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
10:255:20186:8:16:72:539:185:42:Times:99:Times:F:9 Over 60 percent of the natural gas used in Turkey is exported from Russia, which arrives in Turkey via two routes, 
10:256:20303:16:11:72:521:169:99:Times:99:Times:F:first one coming through the Blue Stream pipeline that crosses the Black Sea and the other one traveling via the 
10:257:20416:11:12:72:522:158:99:Times:99:Times:F:West Gas Pipeline through Bulgaria. The capacity of these two pipelines is about 30 billion cubic meters (bcm). 
10:258:20528:12:11:72:524:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:Another pipeline with a capacity of 8.8 bcm is with Azerbaijan that travels through Georgia via the Baku-Tbilisi-
10:259:20641:11:12:72:525:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:Erzurum pipeline that was launched in 2007. The third connection is to Iran with a capacity of 10 bcm of natural 
10:260:20754:12:11:72:516:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:gas. About 79 percent of natural gas imports are transmitted through pipelines, while the remaining 21 percent 
10:261:20865:11:7:72:515:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:comes in liquefied form, mainly from Azerbaijan, Algeria, and Nigeria (International Energy Agency, 2011).   
10:262:20973:7:16:72:543:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:10  For  example,  the  companies  in  charge  of  distribution  in  the  three  largest  provinces,  Istanbul,  Ankara,  and  Izmir  
10:263:21107:16:0:71:274:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:are Igdas, Baskentgaz, and Izmirgaz, respectively. 
11:264:21158:0:28:72:537:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mtoe, while the natural gas consumption has nearly tripled from 4.9 Mtoe to 13.1 Mtoe.  During 
11:265:21253:28:27:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the same period, the share of natural gas in electricity production increased from 37 percent to 46 
11:266:21353:27:28:72:423:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent, while the share of coal decreased from 31 percent to 26 percent. 
11:267:21427:28:28:108:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:C: Since both the construction and operation of natural gas infrastructure at the provincial 
11:268:21517:28:27:72:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:level is handled by the private sector, the factors determining the timing and the rate of 
11:269:21608:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:expansion of natural gas networks are typically associated with the economic viability of costly 
11:270:21705:28:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments that are required to service provinces with natural gas. For example, the proximity to 
11:271:21804:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the main ports operated under the jurisdiction of the central government, the potential size of the 
11:272:21904:27:28:72:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:market (i.e., the number of housing and commercial units or the population size), weather 
11:273:21994:28:27:72:492:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions such as the average duration of the heating season, and the conditions of the 
11:274:22083:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:geographical terrain appear to be important factors (Aras and Aras, 2005; Cesur et al., 2016). 
11:275:22178:28:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Accordingly, it is no surprise that provinces such as Istanbul, Ankara, Bursa, and Eskisehir, that 
11:276:22277:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:are either highly populated, located within close proximity to main pipelines, or with long and 
11:277:22373:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:cold winters are among the early adopters, and provinces in remote regions with difficult access 
11:278:22470:28:27:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:(e.g., Hakkari and Sirnak) or mild climates (e.g., Antalya, Aydin, and Mersin) are either late 
11:279:22565:27:28:72:289:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:adopters or with no natural gas access yet.11

11:286:22699:8:16:72:533:139:42:Times:99:Times:F:11 Once a province is connected to a natural gas network, the decision about whether to switch from coal to natural 
11:287:22815:16:11:71:540:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:gas depends on the type of housing unit occupied by the household. For example, the decision is voluntary for single 
11:288:22932:11:12:71:509:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:family residential units. For residential buildings with multiple housing units, in which over 80 percent of all 
11:289:23045:12:11:71:532:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:households reside, a simple majority decision among the residential units is required to make the change from coal 
11:290:23160:11:0:71:130:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:to natural gas. 
12:291:23177:0:28:108:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:C:Data on natural gas have been obtained from the Turkish Natural Gas Journal (for the 
12:292:23262:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:period 2001 to 2012) and the Turkish Energy Market Regulatory Authority  (for years 2013 and 
12:293:23355:27:28:72:534:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:2014).12 We construct measures that capture the deployment of natural gas networks both in the 
12:294:23450:28:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensive and extensive margins. For the extensive margin, we create an indicator variable for 
12:295:23545:28:27:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether natural gas networks are present and functioning in a province in each year between 
12:296:23637:27:28:72:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:2001 and 2014, and for the intensive margin we create an intensity measure representing the 
12:297:23729:28:28:72:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization rate of natural gas as measured by the number of individual subscribers per 100 
12:298:23821:28:27:72:123:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:persons.13 
12:299:23831:27:28:108:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:C:There is considerable variation in both extensive and intensive dimensions of deployment 
12:300:23920:28:27:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of natural gas. For example, only 5 of the 81 Turkish provinces had access to a natural gas 
12:301:24012:27:28:72:540:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:network in 2001, but this figure has grown to 71 in 2014.14 During the period of our analysis, the 
12:302:24111:28:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas intensity has grown from 3.8 to 14.1 percent.  However, the rate of expansion varies 
12:303:24208:28:27:72:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:widely across provinces.  For example, the subscription rate for natural gas services is over 30 
12:304:24305:27:28:72:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent in Ankara, Eskisehir, and Istanbul, suggesting that the coverage is near universal if one 
12:305:24403:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumes between three to four individuals living per household.15 But then Antalya – a province 
12:306:24499:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:located on the Mediterranean coast with a warm climate – has a natural gas intensity of only 0.75 
12:307:24597:28:28:72:331:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent despite having a network in place since 2009.

12:309:24703:8:16:72:493:231:42:Times:99:Times:F:12 The Natural Gas Journal is published in Turkish under the name “Dogal Gaz Dergisi” and available at  
12:310:24807:16:11:71:533:215:99:Times:99:Times:F:http://www.dogalgaz.com.tr/. It provides data on natural gas on an annual basis until the end of 2012. Note that for 
12:311:24924:11:12:71:517:204:99:Times:99:Times:F:the period after 2012 the same data are also available from the Turkish Energy Market Regulatory Authority at 
12:312:25034:12:7:71:218:192:99:Times:99:Times:F:http://www.epdk.org.tr/tr/anasayfa.  
12:313:25071:7:16:72:542:185:42:Times:99:Times:F:13 An alternative approach could be to create the utilization rate per households instead of per persons. However, it is 
12:314:25192:16:11:71:521:169:99:Times:99:Times:F:not possible to generate this figure for every year since province level household numbers are only available for 
12:315:25306:11:12:71:529:158:99:Times:99:Times:F:2000 and 2011.  Following Cesur et al. (2016), we constructed an approximation to the number of households per 
12:316:25417:12:11:71:531:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:province assuming a linear growth rate.  Results from the analysis using this variable as the treatment measure did 
12:317:25533:11:7:71:364:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:not change any of the implications of the results presented in this paper.  
12:318:25609:7:16:72:520:128:42:Times:99:Times:F:14 Appendix Table 1 presents the list of provinces with natural gas infrastructure by 2014 along with the year of 
12:319:25723:16:7:71:258:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:adoption and natural gas intensity in that year. 
12:320:25771:7:16:72:516:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:15 The average household size in Turkey is 3.8 according to statistics from the Turkish Statistical Institute. See

13:322:25944:0:28:72:182:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Measures of Mortality 
13:323:25966:28:27:108:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:C:The data on mortality were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) for 
13:324:26056:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:the period between 2001-2014. We created age and gender specific mortality rates defined as the 
13:325:26152:28:28:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of deaths per 1,000 persons present in each category. We consider mortality rates for 
13:326:26245:28:27:72:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:males and females between ages 25 to 54 and ages 55 and older that represent the non-elderly 
13:327:26338:27:28:72:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:adult and the elderly mortality rates, respectively.16 As shown in Table 1A, the mortality rate 
13:328:26434:28:27:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:averages about one per 1,000 persons among those aged 25-54 and jumps to about 18 per 1,000 
13:329:26526:27:28:72:539:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:for those aged 55 and older.  Furthermore, the mortality rate is higher among males than females 
13:330:26623:28:28:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:for both adults and the elderly. Figures in columns 2 to 5 of Table 1A reveal that mortality rates 
13:331:26722:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:differ considerably between provinces with and without a natural gas network. For example, 
13:332:26813:27:28:72:519:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:province-year observations with a natural gas network (column 3) has almost twice as high a 
13:333:26905:28:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality rate as those without one (column 2) regardless of age category and gender. A similar 
13:334:27001:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:picture is drawn by columns 4 and 5, which show the means of mortality rates for provinces 
13:335:27092:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:which did not gain access to a natural gas network at any time during the period of our analysis 
13:336:27189:28:27:72:493:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:and those which did gain access to a network during the same period, respectively. The 
13:337:27276:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:information illustrated in Table 1A may lead one to conclude that mortality rates may be directly 
13:338:27373:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to natural gas. However, this would be misleading since it fails to account for potentially 
13:339:27473:28:27:72:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:important factors that may be correlated with both the deployment of gas networks and public 
13:340:27566:27:28:72:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:health at the provincial level. Below we elaborate more on some of the differences between 
13:341:27657:28:14:72:306:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces with and without natural gas network. 
13:342:27704:14:8:216:219:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
13:343:27757:8:16:72:538:162:42:Times:99:Times:F:16 Using alternative age cut-offs to define adult (e.g. 25 to 64) and elderly mortality rates (e.g., 65 and older) did not 
13:344:27880:16:11:71:507:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:cause any appreciable changes to our main findings. Although the focus of this paper is adult and the elderly 
13:345:27990:11:12:71:534:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:mortality, we also estimated models for infant mortality. The results from the analysis of infant mortality presented 
13:346:28108:12:11:71:526:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:in Appendix Table 2, basically provides a reassurance of the findings in Cesur et al. (2016), which performed the 
13:347:28222:11:12:71:537:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:same analysis using data for the period between 2001-2011. The results shown in Appendix Table 2 also reveal that 
13:348:28336:12:11:71:516:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:there is no difference in the estimated relationship between natural gas and infant mortality between males and 
13:349:28448:11:0:71:107:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:females. 
14:350:28458:0:28:72:268:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Time-variant Provincial Characteristics 
14:351:28498:28:27:108:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:C:In our analysis, we account for a set of time-variant characteristics at the provincial level. 
14:352:28593:27:28:72:541:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:These characteristics include number of hospitals and hospital beds per 100,000 persons, number 
14:353:28689:28:28:72:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of automobiles per 1,000 persons, number of physicians per 100,000 persons, an indicator 
14:354:28778:28:27:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable for whether the province has a Family Physician Program in place, and an indicator 
14:355:28870:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable for whether the elected mayor of the central district of the associated province has the 
14:356:28968:28:27:72:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:same political affiliation with the political party governing Turkey.17 We also account for 
14:357:29060:27:28:72:525:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in income per capita, unemployment rate, percentage of population holding a high 
14:358:29153:28:28:72:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:school degree, percentage of population holding a college degree, and number of pupils per 
14:359:29244:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:teacher in secondary schools at the sub-regional level.18 The information pertaining to presence 
14:360:29341:27:28:72:515:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Family Physician Program comes from the Ministry of Health, while all other control 
14:361:29432:28:27:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables are obtained from the TurkStat.19 We also construct dummy variables that equal unity 
14:362:29527:27:28:72:381:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:for observations with missing data on the explanatory variables. 
14:363:29591:28:28:108:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:C:Table 1B displays the means and standard deviations for these characteristics for the full 
14:364:29682:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample as well as by breakdowns of the presence of a natural gas network. As shown in the table, 
14:365:29779:27:28:72:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces with and without a natural gas network differ from each other in a number of 
14:366:29866:28:28:72:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:dimensions. For example, provinces with access to a natural gas network also have more

14:368:30005:8:16:72:537:231:42:Times:99:Times:F:17 Data on province populations are obtained from the TurkStat for years 2000 and 2007-2014 and from the Turkish 
14:369:30118:16:11:71:517:215:99:Times:99:Times:F:Ministry of Health between 2001 and 2006. Since no Census was conducted between years 2001 and 2006, the 
14:370:30223:11:12:71:513:204:99:Times:99:Times:F:province populations for the period of 2001-2006 are based on extrapolations implemented by the Ministry of 
14:371:30331:12:11:71:526:192:99:Times:99:Times:F:Health. Alternatively, we imputed the population figures between 2001 and 2006 using province-specific growth 
14:372:30441:11:12:71:531:181:99:Times:99:Times:F:rates. Using these values produce results that are nearly identical to those presented in this paper. These results are

14:374:30601:7:16:72:541:162:42:Times:99:Times:F:18 These variables are only available at the sub-regional level. According to the TurkStat, Turkey is classified into 12 
14:375:30722:16:11:71:533:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:regions, 26 sub-regions, and 81 provinces. These regions and sub-regions are made up of clusters of provinces that 
14:376:30837:11:7:71:456:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:are grouped together based on geographical proximity to each other and for statistical purposes. 
14:377:30933:7:16:72:533:128:42:Times:99:Times:F:19 The Family Physician Program in Turkey, which was introduced in 2005, has extended basic healthcare services 
14:378:31045:16:12:71:493:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:to the entire Turkish population under a free-of-charge and single-payer system that is fully financed and 
14:379:31152:12:11:71:536:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:administered by the central government.  Cesur et al. (2015) show that the program led to significant improvements 
14:380:31267:11:0:71:138:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:in public health. 
15:381:31286:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:automobiles, higher income, a larger number of hospital beds and physicians, better educated 
15:382:31379:28:27:72:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:populations, and a higher likelihood of having a Family Physician Program in place. These 
15:383:31469:27:28:72:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences suggest that natural gas expansion is more likely in provinces that are wealthier, 
15:384:31564:28:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:more urban, and with more educated populations. This is not surprising because the timing and 
15:385:31658:28:27:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensity of deployment of a natural gas network may be positively associated with demand for 
15:386:31752:27:28:72:516:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas services, which, in turn, is likely to be positively influenced by all these factors.  
15:387:31851:28:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, provinces with natural gas are more likely to have a central district mayor who is 
15:388:31943:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:affiliated with the ruling party. Again, this should not come as a surprise in a country where the 
15:389:32042:27:28:72:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions over resource allocation for local investment projects are controlled by the central 
15:390:32137:28:27:72:135:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:government.

15:393:32173:28:27:72:222:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Natural Gas and Air Pollution 
15:394:32203:27:28:108:486:350:144:Times:144:Times:C:In order for the deployment of natural gas networks to influence mortality, the 
15:395:32283:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:displacement of natural gas by coal induced by these networks should lead to an improvement in 
15:396:32378:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:air quality. There is already evidence, albeit descriptive, in support of a negative relationship 
15:397:32476:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the expansion of the natural gas infrastructure and air pollution (Kaygusuz, 2007).  In 
15:398:32572:28:27:72:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:order to fortify this assumption with more concrete evidence and also to set the stage for our 
15:399:32667:27:28:72:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:main analysis, we obtained data on province level yearly averages of particulate matter (PM10) 
15:400:32762:28:27:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the Turkish Ministry of Health.20 Then, we run regressions for 
15:401:32855:27:28:72:472:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:each of these measures on natural gas intensity controlling for a vector of province 
15:402:32940:28:17:72:525:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics along with province fixed effects, and region specific year dummies. The point 
15:403:33035:17:7:216:219:112:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
15:404:33088:7:16:72:531:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:20 Air pollution is measured by the provincial meteorology centres. The measurements are taken for a minimum of 
15:405:33200:16:0:71:266:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:21 days for each month for at least nine months. 
16:406:33250:0:28:72:530:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates on the measure of natural gas intensity from these regressions are -0.057 for PM10 (p-
16:407:33346:28:27:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:value< 0.05) and -0.022 for SO2 (p-value<0.01) suggesting that a one-percentage point increase 
16:408:33441:27:28:72:519:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the intensity of natural gas results in 5.7 and 2.2 percent decreases in these two pollutants, 
16:409:33539:28:28:72:486:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:respectively.21 Furthermore,  as indicated by p-values in parentheses the estimates are 
16:410:33627:28:27:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant at the 5- and 1-percent levels despite the significantly reduced sample 
16:411:33725:27:28:72:113:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:sizes.22

16:413:33761:27:28:108:501:516:144:Times:144:Times:C:In order to investigate the impact of natural gas networks on adult and the elderly 
16:414:33845:28:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality, we follow the strategy in Cesur et al. (2016) and begin with estimating models of the 
16:415:33942:28:27:72:101:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:form: 
16:416:33948:27:28:108:111:433:144:Times:144:Times:C: 
16:417:33948:28:27:108:449:405:144:Times:144:Times:C:log(MRpt) = Xpt βo + β1NGpt + ωp + λrt + τp t+ τpt2 + εpt,  (1) 
16:418:34007:27:28:72:75:378:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
16:419:34007:28:28:72:514:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:where MRpt represents one of the mortality outcomes for province p in year t. Xpt is a set of 
16:420:34101:28:27:72:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:exogenous determinants of mortality described above. The NGpt is either a binary indicator for 
16:421:34196:27:28:72:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the province p has a natural gas network in place or the intensity of natural gas as 
16:422:34289:28:28:72:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured by the number of subscribers to natural gas services per 100 persons in year t. The 
16:423:34382:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of subscribers is the total number of household and business units with access to natural 
16:424:34479:27:31:72:102:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas.23 
16:425:34485:31:7:216:219:181:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
16:426:34538:7:16:72:533:174:42:Times:99:Times:F:21 Note that data on SO2 the PM10 is available only for a subset of the observations between 2001 and 2014 and for 
16:427:34653:16:12:71:526:158:99:Times:99:Times:F:an unbalanced panel, which results in sample sizes of 772 and 766 year-province observations for SO2 and PM10, 
16:428:34764:12:11:71:536:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:respectively. The coefficients on air pollution measures from a specification with province specific linear trends are 
16:429:34883:11:7:71:299:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:imprecisely estimated likely due to reduced sample size. 
16:430:34939:7:16:72:516:128:42:Times:99:Times:F:22 In the interest of space, we only mention the point estimates on natural gas intensity here, but full results are 
16:431:35056:16:7:71:235:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:available from the authors upon request. 
16:432:35096:7:16:72:525:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:23 Since our unit of analysis is at the provincial level, we are not able to separately identify the private and public 
16:433:35216:16:14:71:540:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:health benefits associated with natural gas networks. However, by conducting the analysis at the provincial level, we 
16:434:35334:14:0:72:75:75:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C: 
17:435:35336:0:28:108:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:C:The causal interpretation of the coefficient β1 is complicated due to confounding variables 
17:436:35427:28:27:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are likely to be correlated with both the deployment of natural gas networks and mortality. 
17:437:35524:27:28:72:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:In order to control for the impact of these factors, we rely on the longitudinal nature of our data 
17:438:35624:28:28:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:and incorporate a series of fixed effects into equation (1). Specifically, the ωp represents province 
17:439:35726:28:27:72:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects accounting for differences across provinces such as poverty, geographic terrain, and 
17:440:35825:27:28:72:500:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:climate conditions, which are likely to remain time-invariant during our analysis period.  
17:441:35916:28:27:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Similarly, the λrt is a set of region-by-year fixed effects that would capture annual shocks to 
17:442:36012:27:28:72:523:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality at the regional level.24 The region-by-year fixed effects would also account for time 
17:443:36108:28:28:72:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends that are common across all provinces within a region.25 The specification in equation (1) 
17:444:36205:28:27:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:additionally allows for the trends in mortality rates to differ across provinces by accounting for 
17:445:36304:27:28:72:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:province-specific linear and quadratic trends. These trends, denoted by the terms, τpt and τpt2, 
17:446:36401:28:28:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:would capture the influence of difficult-to-measure time-varying differences or pre-existing 
17:447:36494:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends across provinces as well as the differences in the rate of growth in natural gas intensity 
17:448:36592:27:31:72:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsequent to the deployment of a natural gas network (Cesur et al., 2016).26 They would  
17:449:36682:31:12:540:543:319:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                                                                                                                                           
17:450:36852:12:11:72:527:307:99:Times:99:Times:F:are also able to avoid the difficulty of dealing with the endogeneity of individual decisions to switch from coal to 
17:451:36969:11:12:72:523:296:99:Times:99:Times:F:natural gas. In that sense, our estimates should be interpreted as the combined effect of natural gas on those who 
17:452:37084:12:7:72:401:284:99:Times:144:g_d0_f4:C:benefit from improved air quality both privately and publicly (Cesur et al., 2016). 
17:453:37167:7:16:72:542:277:42:Times:99:Times:F:24 As mentioned previously, regions in Turkey are clusters of provinces grouped together based on considerations of 
17:454:37283:16:11:72:544:261:99:Times:99:Times:F:geographical  proximity  to  each  other  and  statistical  purposes.  There  are  12  such  regions.  Since  the  province  of  
17:455:37412:11:12:72:543:250:99:Times:99:Times:F:Istanbul  constitutes  a  region  by  itself,  it  is  merged  with  the  neighboring  West  Marmara  region  for  computational  
17:456:37542:12:11:72:542:238:99:Times:99:Times:F:simplicity when we constructed the region-by-year fixed effects. However, treating Istanbul as a separate region or 
17:457:37658:11:12:71:539:227:99:Times:99:Times:F:dropping it from the sample produces nearly identical results. Note that year fixed effects are redundant once region-
17:458:37776:12:7:71:496:215:99:Times:99:Times:F:by-year fixed effects are included. Therefore, the latter would also gauge nationwide shocks to mortality.  
17:459:37883:7:16:72:515:208:42:Times:99:Times:F:25 Regions have clusters of provinces, which share common characteristics that are likely to be correlated with 
17:460:37995:16:11:71:528:192:99:Times:99:Times:F:mortality. Region-by-year fixed effects would account for these common factors. For example, East Marmara is a 
17:461:38106:11:12:71:512:181:99:Times:99:Times:F:region with major urban and industrial provinces like Bursa, and Kocaeli.  Furthermore, the heavier industrial 
17:462:38217:12:11:71:508:169:99:Times:99:Times:F:activity in these provinces may have spillover effects on all the other provinces within the region that are not 
17:463:38330:11:12:71:541:158:99:Times:99:Times:F:necessarily as industrial. For example, Bursa and Kocaeli are linked to each other through highly congested routes of 
17:464:38448:12:11:71:498:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:transportation that have to pass through Yalova, a smaller and less urban province within the same region. 
17:465:38555:11:12:71:520:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:Therefore, any air pollution, for example caused by the traffic congestion between Bursa and Kocaeli, may also 
17:466:38666:12:11:71:534:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:affect the air quality in Yalova. Controlling for region-by-year fixed effects would also mitigate concerns about the 
17:467:38784:11:7:71:211:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:aggregate impact of these factors.  
17:468:38820:7:16:72:543:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:26  This  application  is  similar  to  the  one  in  Wolfers  (2006),  who  examines  the  impact  of  unilateral  divorce  laws  on  
17:469:38955:16:0:71:128:89:99:Times:144:Times:B:divorce rates. 
18:470:38971:0:28:72:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:address the concern that changes in the access to natural gas over time might be correlated with 
18:471:39068:28:27:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:broader changes in public-health conditions or convergence across provinces as well (Barreca et 
18:472:39164:27:28:72:530:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:al., 2014). Finally, εpt represents a random error term. Standard errors are robust to any form of 
18:473:39263:28:28:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:heteroscedasticity and serial correlation as they are clustered at the province level to allow for 
18:474:39362:28:27:72:326:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation within a province (Bertrand et al., 2004). 
18:475:39417:27:28:108:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:C:As mentioned above, equation (1) can be estimated by using either a binary treatment 
18:476:39502:28:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable for the presence of a natural gas network or a continuous intensity measure, which 
18:477:39594:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:captures the extent to which natural gas networks are utilized by the public within a province. In 
18:478:39693:27:28:72:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:the former approach, the coefficient β1 would measure any permanent shift in the rate of 
18:479:39782:28:27:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality associated with the deployment of a natural gas network averaged over the period in 
18:480:39876:27:28:72:527:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:which a province has the network in place. This would be a measure independent of the actual 
18:481:39969:28:28:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of the intensity of natural gas utilization in a province. However, the deployment of a 
18:482:40063:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas network in a province and the adoption of natural gas by the residents of a province 
18:483:40160:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:for space heating and cooking purposes are two separate processes.  The latter is a process that 
18:484:40256:28:27:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:evolves over time and one that depends on a number of factors including the relative price of 
18:485:40350:27:28:72:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:coal to natural gas.  In the end, it is the actual displacement of coal by natural gas that would 
18:486:40448:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:have any bearing in terms of influencing public health. Unless the displacement rate of coal by 
18:487:40544:28:27:71:531:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas reaches a critical level that would have an effect on air pollution, a binary treatment 
18:488:40644:27:28:71:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:model would fail to register any impact on mortality even if all of the provinces have a natural 
18:489:40741:28:27:71:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas network deployed, leading to the misleading conclusion that there is no association between 
18:490:40837:27:33:71:511:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas and mortality.27 This problem may be particularly severe in the current context,

18:492:40983:8:16:72:539:116:42:Times:99:Times:F:27 For instance, consider the extreme case where a province has natural gas available for its citizens as an alternative 
18:493:41104:16:11:71:541:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:source of fuel, but nobody utilizes it. In this case, the effect of natural gas utilization on mortality should be zero, but 
18:494:41229:11:0:71:363:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:a specification with a binary treatment measure would fail to reveal that. 
19:495:41305:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:where there is considerable variation in the intensity of treatment exposure across provinces and 
19:496:41403:28:27:72:127:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time.  
19:497:41415:27:28:108:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:C:To see this more clearly, in Appendix Table 3 we present estimates of the impact of a 
19:498:41501:28:28:72:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:binary indicator of natural gas on the rate of mortality using the specification expressed in 
19:499:41595:28:27:72:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation (1).  The first column presents the raw correlations between the natural gas indicator 
19:500:41691:27:28:72:506:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the all age mortality rate (Panel A), mortality rate for those aged 25-54 (Panel B), and 
19:501:41784:28:28:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality rate for those aged 55 and older (Panel C), all in natural logarithms. As shown in the 
19:502:41881:28:27:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:table, all of these correlations are positive and significant, and remain so even after controlling 
19:503:41981:27:28:72:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:for region-by-year fixed effects.  Only after accounting for permanent differences across 
19:504:42071:28:27:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces in column 3 do these estimates become negative as consistent with the notion that the 
19:505:42167:27:28:72:526:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:displacement of coal by natural gas triggered by the deployment of natural gas networks had a 
19:506:42261:28:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality reducing influence. Moreover, the estimates change little in response to controlling for 
19:507:42360:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:province specific linear and quadratic trends and time-varying characteristics of provinces. They 
19:508:42458:27:28:72:427:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:are also small in size and statistically insignificant in these specifications. 
19:509:42537:28:27:107:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:C:In order to properly capture the dynamic nature of the treatment, we estimate equation (1) 
19:510:42628:27:28:71:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:using the intensity measure of natural gas utilization. This specification recognizes the fact that 
19:511:42728:28:28:71:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:the displacement of coal by natural gas is a process that occurs gradually and one that cannot be 
19:512:42826:28:27:71:538:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:captured using a binary treatment model. The intensity specification is also more relevant from a 
19:513:42924:27:28:71:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:public policy perspective when it comes to formulating policies to accomplish targeted levels of 
19:514:43021:28:27:71:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization of natural gas services.  By employing a treatment measure that captures the extent to 
19:515:43120:27:28:71:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:which natural gas services are deployed in a province, we essentially estimate a dose-effect 
19:516:43213:28:0:71:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship between natural gas networks and mortality.  In this framework, the coefficient β1 in 
20:517:43314:0:28:72:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation (1) using the continuous treatment measure would be interpreted as the impact of the 
20:518:43408:28:27:72:273:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate of natural gas intensity on mortality.  
20:519:43453:27:28:72:139:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:Identification 
20:520:43467:28:28:108:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:C:There is no evidence to suggest that the rationale for the deployment of natural gas 
20:521:43552:28:27:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks was to improve public health by reducing air pollution. Nevertheless, the descriptive 
20:522:43647:27:28:72:500:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics highlighted in Tables 1A and 1B clearly indicate that the pattern in which these 
20:523:43739:28:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks have expanded over time and across provinces has not followed a random pattern 
20:524:43827:28:27:72:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:either. As mentioned before, the provinces with natural gas networks are more likely to be urban, 
20:525:43925:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:industrial, and with more motor vehicles per capita. Therefore, these provinces may also have 
20:526:44019:28:27:72:477:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher mortality despite gaining access to a natural gas network. This can be further 
20:527:44105:27:28:72:501:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:demonstrated by a simple analysis in which time-varying characteristics of provinces are 
20:528:44194:28:28:71:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:regressed on a binary indicator for whether a province has a natural gas network in place. The 
20:529:44289:28:27:71:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:results from this analysis are shown in Appendix Table 4.  As shown in column 1, there are 
20:530:44380:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:strong correlations between observable province characteristics and the natural gas indicator – a 
20:531:44478:28:27:71:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern that has already been established in Table 1B.  As displayed in column 3 of Appendix 
20:532:44571:27:28:71:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 4, this pattern persists when we use the intensity measure instead. However, accounting for 
20:533:44669:28:28:71:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:permanent differences across provinces via fixed effects also causes these differences to become 
20:534:44766:28:27:71:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:much less nuanced, both in terms of size and statistical significance. Once we further control for 
20:535:44865:27:28:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:confounding factors through province-specific linear and quadratic time trends as well as region-
20:536:44962:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:by-year fixed effects, none of the characteristics considered in this analysis are related to either 
20:537:45063:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the natural gas measures (see columns 2 and 4). Importantly, none of the estimates reported in 
20:538:45161:28:0:71:374:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Appendix Table 4 are significant statistically or economically. 
21:539:45226:0:28:108:516:709:144:Times:144:Times:C:To gain further insights about the association between the deployment of natural gas 
21:540:45311:28:27:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks and province characteristics, we next run regressions of the measures of natural gas on 
21:541:45408:27:28:72:520:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:jointly specified time-varying factors listed in Table 1B.  As shown in Appendix Table 5, the 
21:542:45502:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates from this analysis lend further support to the notion that any of the association between 
21:543:45602:28:27:72:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:province characteristics and the pattern in which natural gas networks rolled out over time 
21:544:45693:27:28:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:appears to be exogenous to public health, once we control for year and province fixed effects 
21:545:45787:28:28:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:along with province-specific linear and quadratic trends, and region-by-year fixed effects.  This 
21:546:45885:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:conclusion is also supported by the F-statistics and the corresponding p-values reported at the 
21:547:45981:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:bottom of columns 2 and 4 of Appendix Table 5, which clearly confirm the joint in-significance 
21:548:46076:28:27:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of all these characteristics. Taken together, the evidence from Appendix Tables 4 and 5 lends 
21:549:46170:27:28:72:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:support to the notion that the provincial factors that might be associated with the pattern in which 
21:550:46271:28:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the natural gas networks are deployed become inconsequential once unobserved heterogeneity is 
21:551:46365:28:28:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounted for. We interpret this as strong evidence that any remaining variation in the expansion 
21:552:46463:28:28:72:509:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:of natural gas networks is plausibly exogenous to mortality outcomes (Cesur et al., 2016).  
21:553:46554:28:28:107:515:321:144:Times:144:Times:C:A relevant question to consider is whether there could be other province level policy 
21:554:46640:28:28:71:481:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:developments that might be correlated with the deployment of natural gas networks.  
21:555:46724:28:27:71:497:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alternatively, the deployment of natural gas networks could be part of a larger basket of 
21:556:46814:27:28:71:534:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments or development projects implemented at the provincial level. We could not identify 
21:557:46909:28:27:71:542:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:any such policy decisions that have been rolled out in conjunction with the deployment of natural 
21:558:47007:27:28:71:526:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas networks. It is important to remember that the authority to enact laws and execute policies 
21:559:47103:28:28:71:518:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:concerning energy and health are under the jurisdiction of the central government in Turkey. 
21:560:47196:28:0:71:489:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently, many of these law changes or policies are implemented in all provinces 
22:561:47283:0:28:72:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:concurrently, and thus are accounted for by year fixed effects.28 Furthermore, any differential 
22:562:47379:28:27:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments by the central government at the provincial level should be captured by province-
22:563:47472:27:28:72:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific linear and quadratic time trends alongside with the indicator variable for whether the 
22:564:47568:28:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:district mayor of the province is affiliated with the governing political party. Finally, region-by-
22:565:47668:28:27:72:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:year fixed effects would account for region specific unobserved heterogeneity such as any 
22:566:47758:27:28:72:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:regional investments carried out by the central government in an effort to reduce economic and 
22:567:47853:28:28:72:233:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:health disparities among regions. 
22:568:47886:28:27:108:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:C:If our identification strategy is valid, then natural gas networks should not have any 
22:569:47973:27:28:72:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact on mortality in provinces prior to the deployment of these networks. A violation of this 
22:570:48069:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:condition would suggest that any estimate of the relationship between natural gas networks and 
22:571:48164:27:28:72:497:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality may at least partially be spuriously driven by pre-existing differences between 
22:572:48254:28:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces with and without a natural gas network.  A formal testing of this assumption can be 
22:573:48348:28:27:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:performed by using an event-history analysis, which would enable us to trace out the trends in 
22:574:48443:27:28:72:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality rates year-by-year for the periods leading up to and following the deployment of a 
22:575:48536:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas network (Cesur et al., 2016).  In practice, we implement this analysis by augmenting 
22:576:48633:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation (1) to include interactions between each of the year indicators with the binary indicator 
22:577:48732:28:28:72:531:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the presence of a natural gas network.  The event-history estimates from a specification that 
22:578:48830:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls for province and region-by-year fixed effects are displayed in Figure 1 along with 95 
22:579:48925:27:19:72:486:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent confidence intervals. As shown in the figure, none of the interaction terms are 
22:580:49013:19:8:216:219:193:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
22:581:49066:8:16:72:519:185:42:Times:99:Times:F:28 It can also be argued that natural gas adoption and intensity may influence migration decisions of households 
22:582:49179:16:11:71:517:169:99:Times:99:Times:F:between provinces with and without a natural gas infrastructure. The internal migration decisions are primarily 
22:583:49291:11:12:71:516:158:99:Times:99:Times:F:determined by economic factors in Turkey and the flow of migration has been from rural to urban provinces in 
22:584:49400:12:11:71:529:146:99:Times:99:Times:F:recent decades. To the extent that families migrating into provinces with natural gas are from low socio-economic 
22:585:49514:11:12:71:537:135:99:Times:99:Times:F:status, our estimates would be a lower bound. Data on the proportion of migrants by province are available from the 
22:586:49630:12:11:71:541:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:TurkStat only for the period 2008-2014. We estimated models of migration as a function of natural gas adoption and 
22:587:49745:11:12:71:534:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:expansion along with other control variables. The coefficients on the two natural gas variables were both small and 
22:588:49861:12:11:71:530:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:imprecisely estimated, suggesting that migration decisions are unrelated to natural gas. These results are available 
22:589:49978:11:0:71:199:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:from the authors upon request.  
23:590:50012:0:28:72:520:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significantly different from zero in the years prior to deployment of a natural gas 
23:591:50110:28:27:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:network in a province.  It is assuring that there is no evidence of any systematic relationship 
23:592:50205:27:28:72:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the treatment and mortality measures in those years. As also illustrated in Figure 1, 
23:593:50299:28:28:72:483:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is a clear departure towards reduced mortality beginning with one year after the 
23:594:50386:28:27:72:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:deployment of a natural gas network.  Furthermore, the estimates on the interaction terms 
23:595:50476:27:28:72:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:gradually become more negative over time, which is a pattern consistent with the notion that the 
23:596:50573:28:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:presence of a natural gas network makes a difference in mortality only after the utilization of 
23:597:50669:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas services becomes widespread enough to have an influence on air quality. In fact, the 
23:598:50766:27:28:72:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates on the interaction terms reach statistical significance only in the fourth year of 
23:599:50859:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:deployment. Taken together, the evidence presented in Figure 1 supports the hypothesis that 
23:600:50951:27:28:72:424:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas networks in Turkey had a causal negative effect on mortality.

23:603:51034:27:28:108:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:C: Table 2 presents the estimates of the impact of natural gas intensity from equation (1) on 
23:604:51125:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures of mortality.29  Panel A shows estimates for all age mortality, while Panels B and C 
23:605:51219:27:28:72:509:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:show estimates for those aged 25-54 and 55 and older, respectively. In each panel, the first 
23:606:51312:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:column displays estimates from a specification with no controls, followed by specifications that 
23:607:51409:28:27:72:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:successively add region-by-year fixed effects, province fixed effects, linear and quadratic time 
23:608:51506:27:28:72:250:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends, and time-varying covariates.  
23:609:51544:28:27:108:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:C: The estimates shown in the first column represent raw correlations between natural gas 
23:610:51631:27:28:72:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensity and mortality.  As illustrated before, these correlations are positively signed reflecting 
23:611:51732:28:17:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the non-random nature of the deployment of natural gas networks. Though less pronounced, the

23:613:51878:7:16:72:543:105:42:Times:99:Times:F:29  We  also  estimated  weighted  regressions  using  the  mean  population  density  and  birth  density  as  weights.  These  
23:614:52007:16:0:71:510:89:99:Times:99:Times:F:estimations, shown in Appendix Table 6, did not cause any appreciable changes to the results presented here. 
24:615:52117:0:28:72:533:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:same pattern persists in column 2 of Table 2 when region-by-year fixed effects are added to the 
24:616:52213:28:27:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:specifications. This is also not surprising since region-by-year fixed effects only accounts for 
24:617:52310:27:28:72:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:time-varying unobservables that are at the national or regional level. It is the pre-existing 
24:618:52404:28:28:72:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences across provinces that are likely to be the source of endogeneity of natural gas 
24:619:52496:28:27:72:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks. Accordingly, when we account for permanent differences across provinces via 
24:620:52582:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:province fixed effects in column 3, the estimates switch sign and become negative as predicted. 
24:621:52677:28:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:In addition to permanent differences, specification in column 3 further accounts for any time-
24:622:52771:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:varying differences across provinces that may be trending either linearly or quadratically.  As 
24:623:52867:27:28:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:mentioned earlier, these trends are also likely to account for the differences in the rate of increase 
24:624:52970:28:27:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:in natural gas intensity in the post-deployment years of a natural gas network. Doing so causes 
24:625:53066:27:28:72:518:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:the estimates on the natural gas intensity to decrease by two to three folds.  According to the 
24:626:53162:28:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:point estimates, a one-percentage point increase in the natural gas intensity as measured by the 
24:627:53259:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of subscribers to natural gas services per 100 persons would reduce the all age mortality 
24:628:53356:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate by 1.4 percent, the adult mortality rate by 1.9 percent and the elderly mortality rate by 1.2 
24:629:53455:28:27:72:116:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent.  
24:630:53464:27:28:108:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:C:It is important to note that controlling observed time-variant characteristics of provinces 
24:631:53556:28:28:72:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:should not cause any appreciable changes to our estimates if our identification strategy is valid 
24:632:53654:28:27:72:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i.e., the remaining variation in natural gas intensity is exogenous to health outcomes once the 
24:633:53751:27:28:72:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:unobserved heterogeneity is captured by province fixed effects and province-specific time 
24:634:53841:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends). As displayed in column 5 of Table 2, all three estimates on natural gas intensity remain 
24:635:53939:27:28:72:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:unchanged. In particular, controlling for the eleven time-varying covariates listed in Table 1B 
24:636:54034:28:0:72:482:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:causes no change in the estimates of the impact of natural gas intensity on mortality.  
25:637:54124:0:28:108:530:709:144:Times:144:Times:C:To put these point estimates into context, we next conduct several back of the envelope 
25:638:54212:28:27:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculations for the number of lives saved as a result of the displacement of coal by natural gas.  
25:639:54312:27:28:72:485:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:As illustrated in Table 1A, the average mortality rate for all ages in our province-year 
25:640:54401:28:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations with a natural gas network is 5.18 per 1,000 individuals. Then, a point estimate of -
25:641:54499:28:27:71:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.014 translates into approximately 0.073 lives saved per every 1,000 persons in response to a 
25:642:54594:27:28:71:508:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:one percentage-point increase in the intensity of natural gas. The total number of deaths in 
25:643:54687:28:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Turkey was about 391,000 in 2014. Therefore, approximately 5,460 lives might have been saved, 
25:644:54781:28:27:71:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:had the intensity of natural gas been one-percentage point higher. Similarly, the approximate 
25:645:54875:27:28:71:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:numbers of lives saved among the non-elderly adults and the elderly are 0.027 and 0.292 per 
25:646:54967:28:27:71:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:1,000 individuals in these age groups, respectively. Taking the total number of deaths in these 
25:647:55063:27:28:71:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:age groups in 2014 as a base, these figures translate into a total of 846 lives saved among non-
25:648:55159:28:28:71:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly adults and 3,851 lives saved among the elderly with respect to a one-percentage point 
25:649:55253:28:27:71:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in the intensity of natural gas. It is important to recognize that the number of lives saved 
25:650:55355:27:28:71:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:among the elderly is  much higher than that among the adults even though the percentage effect is 
25:651:55453:28:27:71:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater for the adults than the elderly. This is not surprising because individuals aged 55 and 
25:652:55549:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:older have a much higher baseline mortality and they are also more susceptible to health hazards 
25:653:55646:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:of air pollution. For example, preexisting cardio-respiratory disorders are more common among 
25:654:55740:28:27:72:304:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the elderly than among the younger age groups. 
25:655:55787:27:28:108:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:C: Our empirical analysis essentially exploits the variation in the rate of displacement of 
25:656:55876:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:coal by natural gas across provinces and over time.  In other words, it is assumed that provinces 
25:657:55974:27:28:72:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:in which the displacement takes place at a faster pace than other provinces should have mortality 
25:658:56072:28:28:72:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates decreasing more rapidly in comparison to those of other provinces.  In fact, this is the 
25:659:56167:28:0:72:501:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:reason we refrain from using a binary treatment model as it would fail to capture the true 
26:660:56260:0:28:72:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in natural gas utilization. If our assumption is valid, then we should also observe the 
26:661:56358:28:27:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact of natural gas networks on mortality to increase over time as an increasing number of 
26:662:56451:27:28:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:households switch from coal to natural gas. To test this, we estimate the impact of dichotomous 
26:663:56547:28:28:72:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicators of the number of years since the adoption of natural gas network on measures of 
26:664:56638:28:27:72:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality. These results shown in Appendix Table 7 support the notion of a gradual but 
26:665:56725:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensifying pattern in the hypothesized relationship between natural gas networks and mortality.  
26:666:56824:28:28:72:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:More specifically, the point estimates, which are usually statistically significant, follow an 
26:667:56919:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing trend over time, i.e., the mortality gains associated with improved air quality are likely 
26:668:57021:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:to be increasing over time.  This is consistent with the notion that chronic health problems 
26:669:57114:28:27:72:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:exacerbated by air pollution are not usually reversible easily. Another scenario that is consistent 
26:670:57214:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the pattern obtained in Appendix Table 7 is that air pollution needs to be reduced below 
26:671:57308:28:28:72:432:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:certain inflection points before significant mortality gains can be realized.  
26:672:57387:28:27:108:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:C:Finally, we subject the results shown in Table 2 to additional scrutiny by performing two 
26:673:57477:27:28:72:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:robustness analyses. First, we test whether our results are sensitive to the exclusion of provinces 
26:674:57577:28:27:72:506:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:that never gained access to a natural gas network during our analysis period.  As shown in 
26:675:57668:27:28:72:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Appendix Table 8, estimating the model in equation (1) without these provinces produced 
26:676:57756:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates that are nearly identical to those in Table 2. Second, we exclude provinces that always 
26:677:57854:28:27:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:had a natural gas network during the time period of our analysis.  As presented in Appendix 
26:678:57946:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 9, these results are also indistinguishable from our main estimates. These analyses confirm 
26:679:58043:28:27:72:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:that our main results are not driven by the possibility that there is something fundamentally 
26:680:58137:27:0:72:233:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:different about those provinces.   
27:681:58174:0:28:72:196:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gender-Specific Analysis 
27:682:58198:28:27:108:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:C: To investigate the extent to which the relationship between natural gas intensity and 
27:683:58284:27:28:72:510:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality is gender-specific, we estimate equation (1) separately for males and females. As 
27:684:58376:28:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in Table 3, the evidence from this analysis yields no evidence of a clear distinction in the 
27:685:58475:28:27:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact of natural gas intensity on mortality by gender. Focusing on the most comprehensive 
27:686:58566:27:28:72:492:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification, the estimates are fairly close between males and females for all three age 
27:687:58656:28:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories. This finding is similar to Chen et al. (2013) which examines the mortality and life 
27:688:58752:28:27:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectancy consequences of air pollution using a policy experiment from China. Note that a 
27:689:58843:27:28:72:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure to detect any gender differences in the relationship between natural gas intensity and 
27:690:58938:28:27:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality does not necessarily mean that the number of lives saved as a result of the deployment 
27:691:59035:27:28:72:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:of natural gas networks is identical between males and females since mortality rates are higher 
27:692:59131:28:28:72:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:for males than females regardless of age. For example, the point estimates from the analysis of 
27:693:59227:28:27:72:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:all age mortality indicate that a one-percentage point increase in the intensity of natural gas 
27:694:59323:27:28:72:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:results in 0.080 male lives saved per 1,000 males and 0.060 females lives saved per 1,000 
27:695:59413:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:females. The corresponding figures are 0.036 males and 0.002 females among those aged 25-54, 
27:696:59506:27:28:72:419:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 0.607 males and 0.396 for females among those aged 55 and older.  
27:697:59575:28:28:72:190:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Cause-Specific Analysis 
27:698:59598:28:27:108:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:C: Finally, we examine whether mortality effects of natural gas networks differ between 
27:699:59683:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:deaths linked to cardio-respiratory causes and those linked to non-cardio-respiratory causes. The 
27:700:59781:28:27:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:cause-specific analysis is useful because it is important to understand which health conditions are 
27:701:59881:27:28:72:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:more responsive to improvements in air quality associated with the displacement of coal by 
27:702:59972:28:28:72:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural gas. This knowledge is particularly helpful for the purpose of an accurate cost-benefit 
27:703:60068:28:0:72:501:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis associated with any public policies designed to increase the usage of natural gas 
28:704:60161:0:28:72:518:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks such as a subsidy because the cost of end-of-life care differs greatly across various 
28:705:60256:28:27:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:health conditions.  A cause-specific examination would also serve as a valuable specification 
28:706:60350:27:28:71:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis if the results reveal that estimates are stronger for the type of conditions that are more 
28:707:60450:28:28:71:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly linked to ambient air pollution. A failure to find such a pattern would then cast serious 
28:708:60549:28:27:72:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:doubts on our identification strategy, suggesting that the deployment of natural networks is 
28:709:60642:27:28:72:441:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlated with other factors or developments associated with public health.  
28:710:60720:28:28:108:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:C: To answer these questions, we follow Chen et al. (2013) and classify deaths into two 
28:711:60805:28:27:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups: cardio-respiratory deaths and non-cardio-respiratory deaths. The information used to 
28:712:60898:27:28:71:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:categorize deaths into these two groups is obtained from the Causes of Death Statistics Database 
28:713:60995:28:27:71:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:published by the TurkStat.30 These statistics are based on underlying causes of deaths. We use 
28:714:61090:27:28:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes for the evaluation of main cause of 
28:715:61185:28:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:each death. The cardio-respiratory deaths are those that are linked to ambient air pollution and 
28:716:61282:28:27:71:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:include heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and respiratory illnesses. The non-cardio-respiratory 
28:717:61380:27:28:71:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:deaths include those causes that are unlikely to be related, at least directly, to air pollution and 
28:718:61481:28:27:71:448:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:include other cancers, accidental or violent deaths, various stomach ailments.  
28:719:61561:27:28:107:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:C: The results from this analysis are presented in Table 4.  Focusing on the last column in 
28:720:61650:28:28:71:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Panel A of the table, the estimate on the impact of natural gas intensity on mortality is negative 
28:721:61749:28:27:71:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:and statistically significant, suggesting that a one-percent increase in the intensity of natural gas 
28:722:61851:27:28:71:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:results in a 0.9 percent decrease in cardio-respiratory mortality rate.31 The point estimate is 
28:723:61947:28:26:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant at the five percent level despite likely measurement error in cause-specific 
28:724:62050:26:7:216:219:158:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:                                                      
28:725:62103:7:12:72:296:151:42:Times:99:Times:F:30 See http://www.tuik.gov.tr/PreTablo.do?alt_id=1083. 
28:726:62157:12:16:72:509:139:42:Times:99:Times:F:31 The Causes of Death Statistics Database covers all identifiable death cases detected by physicians from all 
28:727:62268:16:11:71:540:123:99:Times:99:Times:F:localities including provinces and sub-district centers. In comparison with the all age mortality data used in previous 
28:728:62388:11:12:71:535:112:99:Times:99:Times:F:estimations, it is less comprehensive particularly in years prior to 2009 and likely to suffer from measurement error 
28:729:62506:12:11:71:494:100:99:Times:99:Times:F:to a larger degree. The smaller magnitude of the estimated effect of natural gas is likely to be due to such 
28:730:62615:11:0:71:155:89:99:Times:144:g_d0_f4:C:measurement error.  
29:731:62636:0:28:72:508:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:death classifications. Furthermore, as expected, the estimates for non-respiratory mortality 
29:732:62729:28:27:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in Panel B fail to reveal any impact of natural gas intensity on these deaths.  In particular, 
29:733:62830:27:28:72:466:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:the estimate from the most comprehensive specification is -0.004 and statistically 
29:734:62913:28:28:72:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:indistinguishable from zero. In summary, these findings lend further support to our main 
29:735:63002:28:27:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis that the mortality gains caused by natural gas networks are attributable to reduced air 
29:736:63101:27:28:72:121:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:pollution.

29:738:63112:28:27:72:156:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:VI. Conclusions 
29:739:63128:27:28:108:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:C:In this paper, we examine the casual impact of the expansion of natural gas services for 
29:740:63217:28:27:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:residential and commercial use on adult and elderly mortality in Turkey.  The roll-out of natural 
29:741:63315:27:28:72:531:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:gas networks has led to a widespread displacement of coal by natural gas as the primary source 
29:742:63410:28:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fuel in Turkey.  Given that natural gas is a much cleaner source of fossil fuel than coal, 
29:743:63504:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially when it comes to concentrations of particulate matter, we assess whether any potential 
29:744:63602:27:28:72:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:reductions in the carbon intensity in the atmosphere led to improvements in adult and elderly 
29:745:63696:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:health as measured by their respective rates of mortality. To identify these impacts, we utilize the 
29:746:63797:27:28:72:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in the timing of deployment and intensity of expansion of natural gas networks across 
29:747:63893:28:28:72:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Turkish provinces between 2001 and 2014. Our results indicate that the expansion of natural gas 
29:748:63989:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:services has led to a significant reduction in the rate of overall mortality as well as both adult and 
29:749:64092:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly mortality rates. The estimates from our most comprehensive specification indicate that a 
29:750:64189:28:27:72:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:one-percentage point increase in the rate of subscriptions to natural gas services would cause the 
29:751:64288:27:28:72:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality rate to decrease by 1.4 percent (5,460 fewer deaths) among all age groups, 1.9 percent 
29:752:64385:28:28:72:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:(848 fewer deaths) among adults, and 1.2 percent (3,851 fewer deaths) among the elderly.  
29:753:64475:28:0:72:520:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the mortality gains for both age groups are primarily 
30:754:64572:0:28:72:515:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:driven by cardio-respiratory deaths, which are more likely to be due to conditions caused or 
30:755:64665:28:27:72:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:exacerbated by air pollution, such as pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerated 
30:756:64752:27:28:72:518:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:atherosclerosis, heart arrhythmias, and pneumonia.  Finally, our analysis does not reveal any 
30:757:64846:28:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:important gender differences in the estimated relationship between the deployment of natural gas 
30:758:64943:28:27:72:192:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:networks and mortality.  
30:759:64967:27:28:107:502:571:144:Times:144:Times:C:Taken together, our results highlight the health benefits of a nationwide transition 
30:760:65052:28:28:71:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:towards a type of fuel that is gaining popularity due to its abundance, relatively lower cost, and 
30:761:65151:28:27:72:490:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher efficiency. Due to challenges to getting developing countries to commit to legal 
30:762:65239:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:obligations and the ineffectiveness of regulations due to poor governance and corruption, any 
30:763:65333:28:27:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:meaningful reductions to carbon consumption in that part of the world, at least in the short-run, 
30:764:65431:27:28:72:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:would likely come from actions or developments that are voluntary and, more importantly, in the 
30:765:65527:28:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic interest of these countries. The findings of this paper suggest that the availability of 
30:766:65625:28:27:72:485:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:large reserves of natural gas coupled with technological innovations in extraction and 
30:767:65712:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:transmission in recent years has the potential to cause a real improvement in air quality and result 
30:768:65813:28:0:71:433:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:in nontrivial improvements in public health.
