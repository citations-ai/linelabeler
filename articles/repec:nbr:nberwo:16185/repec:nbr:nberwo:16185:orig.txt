2:29:1370:28:14:72:540:586:12:Times:12:Times:Many labor markets share three stylized facts: employers cannot give full attention to all candidates,
2:30:1472:14:14:72:540:572:12:Times:12:Times:candidates are ready to provide information about their preferences for particular employers, and employers
2:31:1579:14:14:72:540:558:12:Times:12:Times:value and are prepared to act on this information. In this paper we study how a signaling mechanism,
2:32:1679:14:14:72:540:544:12:Times:12:Times:where each worker can send a signal of interest to one employer, facilitates matches in such markets.
2:33:1780:14:14:72:540:530:12:Times:12:Times:We find that introducing a signaling mechanism increases the welfare of workers and the number of
2:34:1877:14:14:72:540:516:12:Times:12:Times:matches, while the change in firm welfare is ambiguous. A signaling mechanism adds the most value
2:35:1974:14:42:72:176:502:12:Times:12:Times:for balanced markets.

3:52:2330:0:30:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:53:2347:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Job  seekers  in  labor  markets  often  apply  for  many  positions,  as  there  is  a  low  cost  for
3:54:2450:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:applying  and  a  high  value  for  being  employed.   Consequently,  many  employers  face  the
3:55:2546:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:near impossible task of reviewing and evaluating hundreds of applications.  Moreover, since
3:56:2637:18:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pursuing  candidates  is  often  costly,  employers  may  need  to  assess  not  only  the  quality  of
3:57:2740:18:18:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an applicant, but also whether the applicant is attainable:  that is, whether the candidate
3:58:2831:18:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is likely to ultimately accept a job offer, should the employer make one.  In this paper we
3:59:2922:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:study a mechanism that aids employers in this evaluation process by allowing applicants to
3:60:3012:18:18:72:401:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credibly signal information about their preferences for positions.
3:61:3078:18:18:89:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In practice, in many markets that suffer from this form of application congestion, can-
3:62:3165:18:17:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:didates communicate special interest for a select number of places.  For example, in college
3:63:3257:17:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:admissions in the United States,  many universities have early admission programs,  where
3:64:3346:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high school seniors may apply to exactly one college before the general application period.
3:65:3437:18:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Evidence suggests that universities respond to such action in that it is easier to get into a
3:66:3530:18:18:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:college through early admission programs (Avery,  Fairbanks and Zeckhauser, 2003).1An-
3:67:3616:18:18:71:539:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  example  of  applicants  signaling  interest  can  be  found  in  the  market  for  entry-level
3:68:3718:18:18:71:539:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clinical psychologists, which in the early 1990’s was organized as a telephone-based market.
3:69:3810:18:18:71:539:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On “match day,” program directors called applicants to make offers, and candidates were,
3:70:3898:18:18:71:539:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at  any  moment,  allowed  to  hold  on  to  at  most  one  offer.   At  the  end  of  match  day,  all
3:71:4001:18:18:71:539:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-accepted offers were automatically declared as rejected.  Due in part to its limited time
3:72:4094:18:18:71:539:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:frame,  this market suffered from congestion,  and it was common for program directors to
3:73:4183:18:18:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make offers out of their preference order to applicants who credibly indicated they would
3:74:4272:18:18:71:341:301:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:accept an offer immediately (Roth and Xing, 1997).2
3:75:4323:18:18:89:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Some  markets  have  formal,  market-wide  mechanisms  that  allow  participants  to  signal
3:76:4415:18:17:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preferences, and the formal nature of the signals ensures credibility.  Since 2006, The Ameri-
3:77:4509:17:19:71:539:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can Economic Association (AEA) has operated a signaling service to facilitate the job search
3:78:4601:19:16:85:539:229:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:1Under single early application programs, universities often require that an applicant not apply early to
3:79:4706:16:12:72:540:213:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:other schools, and this is often enforced by high school guidance counselors.  In another example of colleges
3:80:4815:12:11:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:looking for signs of interest, many schools take great care to note whether applicants visit the campus, which
3:81:4925:11:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:presumably is costly for parents in terms of time and money.  This can also be taken into account when
3:82:5027:12:9:72:208:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:colleges decide whom to admit.
3:83:5057:9:15:85:539:169:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2Congestion in the telephone market was costly for program directors who worried that their offer would
3:84:5160:15:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:be  held  the  whole  match  day  and  then  rejected  in  the  last  moments,  leaving  them  to  fill  the  position  in
3:85:5282:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a hectic “aftermarket” with only a few leftover candidates.  As an example of offer strategy, the directors
3:86:5389:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of one internship program decided to make their first offers (for their five positions) to numbers 1, 2, 3, 5,
3:87:5499:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and 12 on their rank-order list of candidates, with the rationale that 3, 5, and 12 had indicated that they
3:88:5606:12:12:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:would accept immediately and that 1 and 2 were so attractive as to be worth taking chances on.  Anecdotal
3:89:5711:12:12:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:evidence suggests that promises to accept an offer were binding.  The market was relatively small, and as
3:90:5816:12:0:72:347:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:one program director mentioned:  “you see these people again.”
4:91:5879:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for economics graduate students.  Using this service, students can send signals to up to two
4:92:5971:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employers  to  indicate  their  interest  in  receiving  an  interview  at  the  annual  Allied  Social
4:93:6074:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Science Associations meeting.  Coles et al. (2010) provide suggestive evidence that sending a
4:94:6167:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signal of interest increases the chances of receiving an interview.  Since interviews take place
4:95:6263:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over a single weekend, departments typically interview about twenty candidates out of hun-
4:96:6353:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dreds of applicants, which suggests that most departments must strategically choose from
4:97:6441:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:among their candidates that are above the bar.3Though not labor markets,  some online
4:98:6526:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dating websites allow participants to send signals to potential partners.  For example in the
4:99:6619:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:matchmaking service of the website “Hot or Not,” participants can send each other virtual
4:100:6708:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flowers  that  purportedly  increase  the  chances  of  receiving  a  positive  response.4In  a  field
4:101:6810:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experiment on a major Korean online dating website, Lee et al. (2009) study the effect of a
4:102:6901:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:user attaching one of a limited number of “virtual roses” to a date request.  They find that
4:103:6993:18:18:71:530:492:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:users of both genders are more likely to accept a request when a virtual rose is attached.5
4:104:7084:18:17:89:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These examples all share three important features. First, in each case substantial frictions
4:105:7176:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lead to market congestion:  employers (or colleges or dating partners) are unable to give full
4:106:7270:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attention  to  all  possible  candidates  when  making  decisions.   Second,  applicants  are  ready
4:107:7370:18:18:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to provide information about their preferences over employers.  Third, employers value this
4:108:7461:18:18:71:342:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preference information and are prepared to act on it.
4:109:7514:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  employers  to  take  useful  action,  preference  signals  must  be  credible.   But  simply
4:110:7611:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:declaring one’s interest typically bears almost no cost, and job seekers have an incentive to
4:111:7704:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicate  particular  interest  to  many  employers,  regardless  of  how  strong  their  preferences
4:112:7805:18:18:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:towards these employers actually are.  Hence,  absent any credibility guarantee,  employers
4:113:7896:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may struggle to discern which preference information is sincere and which is simply cheap
4:114:7985:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:talk.   So  while  candidates  may  wish  to  signal  their  preferences,  and  employers  may  value
4:115:8086:18:15:85:539:277:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:3Similar  mechanisms  exist  for  non-academic  jobs.   For  example,  Skydeck360,  a  student-operated  com-
4:116:8195:15:12:72:540:262:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:pany at Harvard,  offers a signaling service for MBA students in their search for internships and full-time
4:117:8302:12:12:72:540:250:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:jobs.   Each  registered  student  can  send  up  to  ten  signals  to  employers  via  their  secure  website.   (See
4:118:8420:12:8:72:266:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:http://skydeck360.posterous.com for detail.)
4:119:8464:8:16:85:539:230:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:4In this case the number of flowers one may send is unlimited, but each flower is costly.  Signals of interest
4:120:8574:16:12:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:may be helpful in dating markets because pursuing partners is costly.  At the very least, each user may be
4:121:8680:12:12:72:540:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:limited  in  the  number  of  serious  dates  she  can  have  in  a  given  period.   “As  James  Hong  from  HotorNot
4:122:8798:12:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tells it, his virtual flower service has three components:  there’s the object itself represented by a graphical
4:123:8910:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:flower icon, there’s the gesture of someone sending the flower to their online crush, and finally, there’s the
4:124:9020:12:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:trophy  effect  of  everyone  else  being  able  to  see  that  you  got  a  flower.   People  on  HotorNot  are  paying

4:129:9551:16:12:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:dates.   Hence,  dates  may  be  perceived  as  particularly  costly,  so  users  must  decide  carefully  on  whom  to
4:130:9670:12:12:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:“spend” a date.  The study found that candidates of average attractiveness, who may worry that date offers
4:131:9776:12:0:72:420:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:are only “safety” offers, are particularly responsive to signals of special interest.

5:134:10012:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we investigate how asignaling mechanismthat limits the number of signals
5:135:10099:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a job seeker may send can overcome the credibility problem and improve the welfare of market
5:136:10191:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:participants.  We develop a model that can account for the three stylized facts mentioned
5:137:10280:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:above.  In our model, firms make offers to workers, but the number of offers they may make
5:138:10370:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is limited,  so that firms must carefully select the workers to whom they make offers.  We
5:139:10460:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:focus on the strategic question of offer choice and abstract away the question of acquiring
5:140:10551:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information that determines preferences.  Hence, we assume that each agent knows her own
5:141:10639:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preferences over agents on the other side of the market, but is uncertain of the preferences
5:142:10731:18:18:72:151:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of other agents.
5:143:10747:18:18:89:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the simplest version of our model, we assume that both worker and firm preferences
5:144:10832:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are idiosyncratic and uniformly distributed.  Workers have the opportunity to send a signal
5:145:10923:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to one firm, where each signal is binary in nature and does not transmit any further infor-
5:146:11014:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mation.  Firms observe their signals, but not the signals of other firms, and then each firm
5:147:11106:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simultaneously makes exactly one offer to a worker.  Finally, workers choose offers from those
5:148:11200:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:available to them.  We focus on symmetric equilibria in anonymous strategies to eliminate
5:149:11289:18:18:72:371:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any coordination devices beyond the signaling mechanism.
5:150:11345:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  show  that,  in  expectation,  introducing  a  signaling  mechanism  increases  both  the
5:151:11438:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number  of  matches  as  well  as  the  welfare  of  workers.   Intuitively,  when  firms  make  offers
5:152:11541:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to workers who send them signals, these offers are unlikely to overlap, leading to a higher
5:153:11632:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected number of matches.  Furthermore, workers are not only more likely to be matched,
5:154:11721:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but are also more likely to be matched to a firm they prefer the most.  On the other hand,
5:155:11811:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when a firm makes an offer to a worker who has signaled it, this creates strong competition
5:156:11902:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for firms who would like to make an offer to that same worker because, for example, they
5:157:11990:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rank that worker highest.  Hence, by responding to signals, that is, being more likely to make
5:158:12084:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offers to workers who have signaled them, firms may generate a negative spillover on other
5:159:12174:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.   Consequently,  the  effect  on  firm  welfare  from  introducing  a  signaling  mechanism
5:160:12272:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  ambiguous;  welfare  for  a  firm  depends  on  the  balance  between  individual  benefit  from
5:161:12372:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responding  to  signals  and  the  negative  spillover  generated  by  other  firms  responding  to
5:162:12471:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals.  Furthermore, we show that the degree to which a firm responds to signals is a case
5:163:12563:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of strategic complements.  When one firm responds more to signals, it becomes riskier for
5:164:12652:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms to make offers to workers who have not sent them signals.  Consequently, multiple
5:165:12745:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria, with varying responsiveness to signals, may exist.  These equilibria can be welfare
5:166:12840:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ranked:  workers prefer equilibria where firms respond more to signals, while firms prefer the
5:167:12934:18:0:72:249:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria where they respond less.
6:168:12970:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also study an extension in which workers have correlated preferences.  In this setting
6:169:13059:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a worker may not necessarily signal to her overall most preferred firm.  This implies that
6:170:13149:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms cannot be certain that an offer made to a worker who sent a signal will be accepted.
6:171:13239:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nonetheless, for a class of correlated preferences we show that the introduction of a signaling
6:172:13334:18:18:72:489:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism increases the expected number of matches and the welfare of workers.
6:173:13412:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand when a signaling mechanism might be most helpful, we compare perfor-
6:174:13494:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mance across market settings.  To do this, we focus on a simpler environment where agents
6:175:13583:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:care about getting a match,  but not the quality of the match.  Hence,  the value of intro-
6:176:13674:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ducing  a  signaling  mechanism  is  simply  the  expected  increase  in  the  number  of  matches.
6:177:13773:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For such an environment, we find that the value of a signaling mechanism is maximal for
6:178:13860:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:balanced markets; that is, markets where the number of firms and workers are of roughly the
6:179:13951:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:same magnitude.  We further show that the increase in the number of matches is roughly
6:180:14037:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:homogenous of degree one in the number of firms and workers.  That is, signaling mechanisms
6:181:14128:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are equally important for large and small markets in terms of the expected increase in the
6:182:14218:17:18:72:240:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fraction of matched participants.
6:183:14251:18:18:89:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  approach  is  related  to  several  strands  of  literature.   A  standard  interpretation  of
6:184:14350:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaling and its effectiveness is that applicants have private information that is pertinent
6:185:14443:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  how  valuable  an  employee  they  would  be.   For  example,  in  Spence’s  signaling  model
6:186:14540:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Spence,  1973),  applicants  use  wasteful  costly  signals,  such  as  education,  to  signal  their
6:187:14642:18:18:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:type, such as their ability.6More recently, Avery and Levin (2009) model early application
6:188:14732:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  US  college  admissions  as  a  way  for  students  to  signal  college-specific  quality,  such  as
6:189:14836:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enthusiasm  for  a  particular  college.   In  their  model,  colleges  explicitly  derive  more  utility
6:190:14941:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from having enthusiastic students in their freshman class than they do from other, equally
6:191:15031:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able students.  By contrast, in our model we abstract away from such motives and instead
6:192:15119:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:show how congestion, stemming from the explicit monetary or opportunity costs of making
6:193:15206:18:18:72:360:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offers, can generate room for useful preference signaling.
6:194:15264:18:17:89:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A more closely related strand of literature is that of strategic information transmission,
6:195:15354:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or “cheap talk,” between a sender and receiver, introduced in Crawford and Sobel (1982).
6:196:15442:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In our model,  however,  we consider a multi-stage game with many senders (workers) and
6:197:15529:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many receivers (firms), where the structure of allowable signals plays a distinctive role.  Each
6:198:15625:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sender must choose the receiver to whom she will send one of her limited, identical signals,
6:199:15717:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the scarcity of signals induces credibility.  Each receiver knows only whether a sender has
6:200:15812:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sent a signal to it or not, and receives no additional information.  While Crawford and Sobel
6:201:15905:18:16:85:539:116:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:6Hoppe, Moldovanu and Sela (2009) extend this idea to an environment where agents on both sides of the
6:202:16007:16:11:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:market may send signals.  Among other findings, they identify general conditions under which the potential
6:203:16113:11:0:72:498:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:increase in expected output due to the introduction of signaling is offset by the costs of signaling.
7:204:16215:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1982) study a coordination problem between the sender and receiver, our setting includes an
7:205:16307:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional coordination problem among receivers who must decide whom to make an offer.
7:206:16393:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nevertheless, some features of Crawford and Sobel persist in our model.  Signals are “cheap”
7:207:16485:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the sense that they do not have a direct influence on agent payoffs.  Each agent has only a
7:208:16579:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:limited number of signals, so there is an opportunity cost associated with sending a signal.
7:209:16671:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally,  in  our  model  there  always  exist  babbling  equilibria  where  agents  ignore  signals;
7:210:16772:18:18:72:512:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hence, the introduction of a signaling mechanism always enlarges the set of equilibria.
7:211:16859:18:18:89:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While to our knowledge we are the first to introduce preference signaling in decentralized
7:212:16949:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markets,  papers by Abdulkadiroglu,  Che and Yasuda (2008) and Lee and Schwarz (2007)
7:213:17034:18:18:72:460:546:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:deal with preference signaling in the presence of centralized clearinghouses.7
7:214:17112:18:18:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  summary,  our  paper  models  the  introduction  of  a  signaling  mechanism  in  markets
7:215:17205:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where interviews or offers are costly for firms, either in direct monetary terms or because of
7:216:17299:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:opportunity costs.  Our results suggest potentially large welfare gains for workers,  and an
7:217:17391:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase in the expected total number of matches.  Furthermore, as the experience with the
7:218:17481:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic job market shows, introducing a signaling mechanism can be a low cost, unintrusive
7:219:17572:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:means of improving maket outcomes.  As such we see our paper as part of the larger market
7:220:17661:18:18:72:248:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:design literature (c.f.  Roth, 2008).
7:221:17698:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 begins with a simple example, and Sections 3
7:222:17784:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 4 discuss the offer game with and without a signaling mechanism, respectively.  Section
7:223:17875:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5 considers the impact of introducing a signaling mechanism on the welfare of agents.  In
7:224:17964:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Section 6 we examine signaling in an environment with correlated agent preferences.  Section
7:225:18056:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:7 analyzes the robustness of the welfare results across various market structures.  Section 8
7:226:18149:18:45:72:124:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concludes.
7:227:18159:45:30:72:259:268:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:2    A Simple Example
7:228:18180:30:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this section we lay out a simple example that shows the effects of introducing a signaling
7:229:18273:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism  and  highlights  some  of  our  main  findings.   Consider  a  market  with  two  firms
7:230:18371:18:18:72:539:202:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:{f1,f2}and  two  workers{w1,w2}.   For  each  agent,  a  match  with  one’s  most  preferred
7:231:18463:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partner from the other side of the market yields payoff 1, while a match with one’s second
7:232:18553:18:18:72:432:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choice partner yieldsx∈(0,1).  Remaining unmatched yields payoff 0.
7:233:18620:18:16:85:539:148:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:7Abdulkadiroglu, Che and Yasuda (2008) show that the introduction of a signaling technology improves

7:235:18827:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:preference signaling in a match formation process between firms and workers that consists of three steps:
7:236:18932:12:11:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:preference signaling, investments in information acquisition, and formation of matches via a centralized clear-
7:237:19043:11:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:inghouse.  They construct a centralized mechanism where workers communicate their complete preferences
7:238:19145:12:0:72:508:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to an intermediary, and the intermediary recommends to each firm a subset of workers to interview.
8:239:19244:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Ex-ante, agent preferences are random, uniform and independent.  That is, for each firm
8:240:19331:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:f, the probability thatfprefers workerw1to workerw2is one half, as is the probability
8:241:19416:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thatfprefersw2tow1.  Worker preferences over firms are similarly symmetric.  Agents learn
8:242:19505:18:18:71:389:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their own preferences, but not the preferences of other agents.
8:243:19568:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We first examine behavior in a game where once agent preferences are realized, each firm
8:244:19656:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may  make  a  single  offer  to  a  worker.   Workers  then  accept  at  most  one  of  their  available
8:245:19760:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offers.   We  will  examine  sequential  equilibria,  which  guarantees  that  workers  accept  their
8:246:19861:18:18:71:170:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:best available offer.
8:247:19882:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the unique equilibrium of this game where firm strategies do not depend on the name
8:248:19968:18:18:71:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the worker,8each firm simply makes an offer to its most preferred worker.  This follows
8:249:20058:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because firms cannot discern which worker is more likely to accept an offer.  In this congested
8:250:20153:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market there is a fifty percent chance that both firms make an offer to the same worker, in
8:251:20244:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which case there will only be one match.  Hence, on average there are 1.5 matches, and the
8:252:20334:18:17:71:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected payoff for each firm is341 +140 = 0.75.  For workers, if they receive exactly one offer,
8:253:20431:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it is equally likely to be from their first or second choice firm.  There is also a fifty percent
8:254:20528:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:chance that one worker receives two offers, hence attaining a payoff of one while the other
8:255:20619:18:18:71:461:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:worker receives zero.  The expected payoff for each worker is then (2 +x)/4.
8:256:20695:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  now  introduce  a  signaling  mechanism:  before  firms  make  offers,  each  worker  may
8:257:20788:18:18:71:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send asignalto a single firm.  Each signal has a binary nature:  either a firm receives a signal
8:258:20884:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from a particular worker or not, and signals do not not transmit any other information.  We
8:259:20975:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:focus on non-babbling equilibria, where firms interpret a signal as a sign of being the more
8:260:21067:18:18:71:510:331:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:preferred firm of that worker, and workers send a signal to their more preferred firm.9
8:261:21154:18:18:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To analyze firm behavior, note that a firm that receives a signal from its top worker will
8:262:21244:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make this worker an offer, since it will certainly be accepted.  If on the other hand a firm
8:263:21336:18:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:receives no signals, it again optimally makes an offer to its top worker, as symmetry implies
8:264:21429:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the workers are equally likely to accept an offer.  The interesting strategic decision a firm
8:265:21522:18:17:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:must make is when it receives a signal only from its second ranked worker.  In this case the
8:266:21614:17:18:71:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firm also receives exactly one signal.  We say a firm “responds” to the signal if it makes
8:267:21710:18:18:71:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the signaling worker an offer, and “ignores” the signal if it instead makes an offer to its top
8:268:21805:18:18:71:268:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker, which did not send it a signal.
8:269:21844:18:18:89:539:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Supposef1prefersw1tow2and  onlyw2sent  a  signal  tof1,  which  impliesw1sent  a
8:270:21924:18:12:85:356:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:8See Section 3 for a formal definition of anonymous strategies.
8:271:21987:12:16:85:539:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:9Note  that  there  is  no  equilibrium  where  firms  expect  signals  from  workers,  but  interpret  them  as  a
8:272:22102:16:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:particular lack of interest and hence reduce the probability of making an offer to a signaling worker.  If this
8:273:22213:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:were the case, workers would simply not send any signal.  There are, however, babbling equilibria where no
8:274:22319:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:information is transmitted, though we will not focus on those in this paper, as they are equivalent to not
8:275:22425:12:0:72:184:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:having a signaling device.

9:278:22617:18:18:71:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an offer tow1,  whichw1will accept,  hence leavingf1a payoff of 0.  Iff2ignores signals,
9:279:22705:18:18:71:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then there is still a fifty percent chance thatw1is actuallyf2’s first choice, in which case an
9:280:22800:18:18:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer is tendered and accepted, so thatf1again receives 0.  Otherwise,f1receives 1.  Table

9:288:23132:37:17:89:539:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 1 shows that strategies of firms are strategic complements.  If a firm responds to
9:289:23220:17:18:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals, then the other firm is weakly better off from responding to signals as well.  In this

9:292:23498:18:18:72:467:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who has signaled), thenf1optimally also takes the safe action of responding.
9:293:23574:18:18:89:539:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Turning  to  equilibrium  analysis,  note  that  ifx >0.5  there  is  a  unique  equilibrium  in
9:294:23670:18:18:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which both firms respond to signals.  Whenx <0.5, that is when the value of the first choice
9:295:23762:18:18:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker is much greater than that of the second ranked worker, there exist two equilibria in
9:296:23853:18:18:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pure strategies.  In the first, both firms respond to signals (Respond-Respond) and in the
9:297:23943:18:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:second both firm ignore signals (Ignore-Ignore).10Table 2 summarizes welfare properties of
9:298:24033:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these equilibria.  Note that the expected firm and worker payoffs,  as well as the expected
9:299:24124:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number  of  matches  when  signals  are  ignored  are  the  same  as  when  there  is  no  signaling
9:300:24224:18:18:72:418:251:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:mechanism, since agent actions in these two settings are identical.11
9:301:24293:18:18:89:539:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Whenever there are multiple equilibria (x <0.5), we can rank them in terms of firm wel-
9:302:24380:18:17:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fare, worker welfare, and the expected number of matches.  Workers and firms are opposed in
9:303:24471:17:16:81:539:198:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:10There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium whenever there are two pure strategy equilibria.  Properties
9:304:24576:16:8:72:483:182:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of this equilibrium coincide with those in the equilibrium where both firms respond to signals.
9:305:24671:8:16:81:539:174:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:11When  both  firms  respond  to  signals,  since  each  firm  has  a  fifty  percent  chance  of  receiving  a  signal
9:306:24790:16:12:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:from  its  first  choice  worker,  half  the  time  this  strategy  yields  payoff  of  one.   Otherwise  a  firm  has  a  1/4
9:307:24916:12:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance of receiving a signal from its second choice worker only, yielding a payoff ofx.With a 1/4 chance a
9:308:25022:12:12:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:firm receives no signal, in which case it makes an offer to its first choice worker, who will accept with fifty
9:309:25133:12:12:72:540:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:percent probability (whenever she is not the first choice worker of the other firm).  Hence,  expected firm
9:310:25240:12:12:72:539:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:payoffs are121 +14x+14121 =5+2x8.  Payoffs for workers can similarly be calculated given these outcomes.
9:311:25344:12:12:71:539:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Furthermore, when one firm receives all signals (which happens half the time) there is a fifty percent chance
9:312:25453:12:12:71:539:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of firms making offers to the same worker, and hence, of only one match occuring, so the expected number

10:321:25978:18:18:72:540:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:while one firm may privately gain from responding to a signal,  such an action may nega-
10:322:26066:18:17:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tively affect the other firm.  The expected number of matches in the equilibrium when both
10:323:26156:17:18:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms respond to signals is always greater than in the equilibrium when both firms ignore the
10:324:26249:18:18:72:109:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals.
10:325:26257:18:18:89:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These welfare results enable us to study the effects of introducing a signaling mechanism,
10:326:26347:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as outcomes in the offer game without signals are identical to those when both firms ignore
10:327:26438:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals  (even  if  the  Ignore-Ignore  equilibrium  does  not  exist).   The  expected  number  of

10:329:26636:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium are greater than in the offer game with no signals.  The welfare of firms changes
10:330:26729:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ambiguously with the introduction of a signaling mechanism. We now show that these results

10:334:26888:26:18:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper we aim for a simple hiring model in which we can highlight the role of agents
10:335:26979:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:being able to credibly signal preferences in the presence of congestion.  We have a market
10:336:27069:18:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a set of firms,  a set of workers,  and a distribution over firm and worker preferences.
10:337:27162:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each  firm  has  the  capacity  to  hire  at  most  one  worker,  and  each  worker  can  fill  at  most
10:338:27266:18:17:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one position.  We examine an extreme form of congestion:  each firm may make at most one
10:339:27354:17:18:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer to hire a worker, where we implicitly assume that workers have applied to all firms.  In
10:340:27448:18:18:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:theoffer  game  with  no  signals, firms make an offer based on the limited knowledge of the
10:341:27540:18:18:72:539:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution of worker preferences.  In the second setting,the offer game with signals, before
10:342:27634:18:18:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offers are made, each worker has the opportunity to send one costless signal to a firm, who
10:343:27725:18:18:71:539:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may use this signal to partially infer worker preferences.  In the web appendix we show that
10:344:27817:18:18:71:539:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the main results carry over when firms have multiple positions and workers can send several
10:345:27908:18:0:71:108:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals.
11:346:27917:0:18:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:LetF={f1,...,fF}be the set of firms, andW={w1,...,wW}be the set of workers,
11:347:27992:18:18:71:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with|F|=Fand|W|=W.  We consider markets with at least two firms and two workers.
11:348:28072:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Firms and workers have preferences over each other.  For each firmf, let Θfbe the set of
11:349:28160:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all possible preference lists over workers, whereθf∈Θfis a vector of lengthW.  We use
11:350:28245:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the convention that the worker of rank one is the most preferred worker, while the worker of
11:351:28337:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rankWis the least preferred worker.  The set of all firm preference profiles is ΘF= (Θf)F.
11:352:28427:18:18:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Similarly,  we defineθw,  Θwand ΘWfor workers.  Let Θ≡ΘF×ΘW,  and lett(·) be the
11:353:28507:18:18:72:276:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution over preference list profiles.

11:356:28714:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the following sense:  we assume that a firm’s utility for a match depends only on a worker’s
11:357:28806:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:rank.  That is, for any permutationρof worker indices,we haveu(ρ(θf),ρ(w)) =u(θf,w).12
11:358:28892:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Furthermore, all firms have the same utility functionu(·,·).  Workerwwith preference list

11:360:29065:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  all  workers  share  the  same  utility  function.   Though  not  essential  for  our  results,  we
11:361:29169:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will assume that workers and firms derive zero utility from being unmatched, and that any
11:362:29258:18:18:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:match is preferable to remaining unmatched for all participants.  Amarketis given by the

11:364:29365:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For Sections 3-5,  we will focus on a simple preference structure:  each firmfhas pref-
11:365:29452:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:erences over the workers chosen uniformly, randomly and independently from the set of all
11:366:29541:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strict preference orderings over all workers.  Worker preferences are analogously chosen; that
11:367:29635:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is, there is no correlation in preferences.  This will make the problem symmetric and easy to
11:368:29728:18:18:72:113:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analyze.
11:369:29736:18:18:89:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Section 6 we will relax this assumption, and consider the case in which preferences of
11:370:29825:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers over firms may exhibit correlation.  In the web appendix we consider a more involved
11:371:29917:18:39:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:symmetric model where firms have several slots to fill, and workers can send multiple signals.
11:372:30011:39:25:72:341:220:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3.2    The Offer Game with No Signals
11:373:30048:25:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We first examine behavior in the absence of a signaling mechanism.  Play proceeds as follows.
11:374:30141:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:After preferences of firms and workers are realized, each firm simultaneously makes an offer
11:375:30233:18:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to at most one worker.  Workers then choose at most one offer from those available to them.
11:376:30324:18:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Sequential rationality ensures that workers will always select the best available offer.  Hence,
11:377:30420:18:15:81:540:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:12Letρ:{1,...,W} → {1,...,W}be a permutation.  Abusing notation, we applyρto preference lists,
11:378:30514:15:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:workers, and sets of workers such that the permutation applies to the worker indices.  For example, suppose
11:379:30621:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f6:W= 3, ρ(1) = 2, ρ(2) = 3,andρ(3) = 1.  Then we haveθf= (w1,w2,w3)⇒ρ(θf) = (w2,w3,w1) and
11:380:30709:12:0:72:124:84:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f6:ρ(w1) =w2.
12:381:30721:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we take the workers’ behavior in the last stage as given and focus on the reduced game with
12:382:30812:18:18:72:228:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only firms as strategic players.
12:383:30844:18:18:89:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Once its preference listθf(f’s type) is realized,  firmfdecides whether and to whom

12:385:31009:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preference lists to the set of distributions over the union of workers with the no-offer option,

12:395:31708:28:18:89:539:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  focus  on  equilibria  in  which  firm  strategies  areanonymous;that  is,  they  depend
12:396:31800:18:18:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only  on  workers’  ranks  within  a  firm’s  preference  list.   This  rules  out  strategies  that  rely
12:397:31906:18:18:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  worker  indices,  eliminating  any  coordination  linked  to  the  identity  of  workers.   As  an
12:398:32008:18:18:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:example,  “always  make  an  offer  to  my  second-ranked  worker”  is  an  anonymous  strategy,
12:399:32104:18:28:72:379:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:while “always make an offer to the worker calledw2” is not.

12:402:32300:28:18:89:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When deciding whom to make an offer, firms must consider both the utility from hiring a
12:403:32387:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific worker and the likelihood that this worker will accept an offer. Because preferences of
12:404:32483:18:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:both firms and workers are independently and uniformly chosen from all possible preference
12:405:32573:18:17:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:orderings, and since firms use anonymous strategies, an offer to any worker will be accepted
12:406:32665:17:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  equal  probability.   Hence,  each  firm  optimally  makes  an  offer  to  the  highest-ranked
12:407:32765:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker on its preference list. Indeed, this is the unique equilibrium when firms use anonymous

13:415:33187:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that the above statement requires that firm strategies be anonymous only in equi-

13:417:33374:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As seen in the example in Section 2, in this equilibrium there might be considerable lack of

13:419:33523:45:30:72:349:609:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:4    The Offer Game with Signals
13:420:33555:30:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now modify the game so that each worker may send a “signal” to exactly one firm.  A
13:421:33641:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signal is a fixed message;  that is, the only decision of workers is whether and to whom to
13:422:33732:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send a signal.  No decision can be made about the content of the signal.  Note that the signal
13:423:33826:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does not directly affect the utility a firm derives from a worker,  as the firm’s utility from
13:424:33920:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hiring a worker is determined by how high the firm ranks that worker.  However, the signal
13:425:34010:18:18:72:539:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of a worker may affect a firm’s beliefs over whether that worker is likely toacceptan offer.
13:426:34102:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since we have a congested market where firms can only make one offer, these beliefs may
13:427:34189:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affect the firm’s decision of whom to make an offer.  The offer game with signals proceeds in
13:428:34282:18:28:72:136:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:three stages:
13:429:34295:28:17:86:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.  Agents’ preferences are realized.  Each worker decides whether to send a signal, and to
13:430:34386:17:18:101:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which firm.  Signals are sent simultaneously, and are observed only by firms who have
13:431:34471:18:28:101:175:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:received them.
13:432:34485:28:28:86:512:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.  Each firm makes an offer to at most one worker; offers are made simultaneously.
13:433:34568:28:28:86:473:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.  Each worker accepts at most one offer from the set of offers she receives.
13:434:34646:28:18:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Once again, sequential rationality ensures that workers will always select the best available
13:435:34739:18:18:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer.   Hence,  we  take  this  behavior  for  workers  as  given  and  focus  on  the  reduced  game
13:436:34841:18:18:72:240:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consisting of the first two stages.
13:437:34876:18:18:89:539:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  the  first  stage,  each  worker  sends  a  signal  to  a  firm,  or  else  chooses  not  to  send  a

13:440:35162:18:18:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that is,σw: Θw→∆(F ∪N).  In the second stage, each firm observes the set of workers
13:441:35245:18:17:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that sent it a signal,WS⊂W, and based on these signals forms beliefsμf(·|WS) about the
13:442:35331:17:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preferences of workers.  Each firm, based on these beliefs as well as its preferences, decides
13:443:35425:18:18:72:539:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether and to whom to make an offer.  A mixed strategy of firmfis a map from the set of

14:468:37244:25:18:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To analyze equilibrium behavior, we first turn to the workers’ choice of whether and to whom
14:469:37336:18:18:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to send a signal.  In any symmetric equilibrium in which workers send signals and signals
14:470:37425:18:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are interpreted as a sign of interest by firms and hence increase the chance of receiving an
14:471:37517:18:18:71:539:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer,each worker sends her signal to her most preferred firm.  Since sending a signal to any
14:472:37610:18:18:71:539:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm  will  lead  to  identical  probabilities  of  receiving  an  offer,  it  is  optimal  for  each  worker
14:473:37719:18:18:71:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to simply send its signal to its highest ranked firm (see Proposition 4 in Section 6, which
14:474:37810:18:18:71:397:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provides the analog of this statement for a more general setup).
14:475:37874:18:16:81:539:101:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:15As usual in a sequential equilibrium, permissible off-equilibrium beliefs are defined by considering the
14:476:37980:16:0:72:235:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:limits of completely mixed strategies.
15:477:38020:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that babbling equilibria in which no information is transmitted via signals also exist.
15:478:38112:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In one form of such equilibria, firms ignore signals and workers randomize any signals they
15:479:38203:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send across firms.  In another version, workers do not send signals, and firms interpret unex-
15:480:38297:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pected signals negatively.  Note however that equilibria where firms interpret off-equilibrium
15:481:38391:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals negatively fail to survive standard equilibrium refinements (see Section 6 for details).
15:482:38487:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, “perverse” equilibria, where firms interpret signals negatively, e.g.  as a sign of a
15:483:38581:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular lack of interest in such a position, and workers nevertheless send such signals do
15:484:38674:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not exist.  This is because workers may always opt against sending a signal.  We focus on
15:485:38763:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-babbling equilibria, in which each worker sends a signal only to her most preferred firm.
15:486:38856:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence, we have pinned down worker equilibrium behavior:  workers send a signal to their
15:487:38943:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highest ranked firm, and workers accept the best available offer.  We now examine offers of
15:488:39034:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms in the second stage of the game, taking the strategies of workers and beliefs of firms
15:489:39126:18:18:72:259:492:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:about interpreting signals as given.16

15:491:39245:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:received signals from a subset of workersWS⊂ W.  Callf’s most preferred worker in this

15:493:39377:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Whenever workers signal to their most preferred firm,  and other firms use anonymous
15:494:39461:18:18:71:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies,f’s offer choice is reduced to a binary decision between making an offer to the
15:495:39551:18:18:71:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:top ranked worker,Tf,  and the most preferred (potentially) lower-ranked worker who has
15:496:39638:18:18:71:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaled it,Sf.  When the two coincide, that is whenTf=Sf, there is no tradeoff, and firm
15:497:39727:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:fwill make an offer to this worker.  The expected payoff toffrom making an offer toTfor
15:498:39814:18:18:71:540:331:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:Sf(whichever yields greater payoff) is strictly greater than the payoff from making an offer
15:499:39906:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to any other worker.  This follows from the symmetry of worker preferences and strategies
15:500:39995:18:18:71:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the anonymity of firm strategies:  for any two workers who sent a signal,f’s expectation
15:501:40087:18:18:71:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that these workers will accept an offer is identical.  Hence, iffmakes an offer to a worker
15:502:40178:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who sent a signal, it should make that offer to the worker it prefers the most among them.
15:503:40268:18:17:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The same logic holds for any two workers who have not sent a signal.  (Propositions A2 and
15:504:40358:17:18:71:461:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A3 in Appendix A.2 provide a rigorous argument for the above statements).
15:505:40431:18:22:89:524:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This suggests a special kind of strategy for firms, which we will call acutoff strategy.

15:512:40721:19:15:81:539:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:16Note that in any non-babbling symmetric equilibrium, all information sets for firms are realized with
15:513:40824:15:12:72:540:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:positive probability.  Hence,  firm beliefs are determined by Bayes’ Law:  if a firm receives a signal from a
15:514:40933:12:0:72:386:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:worker, it believes that worker ranks the firm first in her preference list.
16:515:41011:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We call (j1,...,jW)f’scutoff vector, which has as its componentscutoffsfor each positive
16:516:41099:18:28:71:239:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number|WS|of received signals.
16:517:41129:28:18:89:539:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A firmfwhich employs a cutoff strategy need only look at the rank of the most preferred
16:518:41216:18:18:71:540:644:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker who sent it a signal, conditional on the number of signalsfhas received.  If the rank
16:519:41308:18:18:71:539:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of this worker is below a certain cutoff (lower ranks are better since one is the most preferred
16:520:41404:18:18:71:540:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rank), then the firm makes an offer to this most preferred signaling workerSf.  Otherwise the
16:521:41497:18:18:71:539:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm makes an offer to its overall top ranked workerTf.  Cutoffs may in general depend on the
16:522:41590:18:18:71:539:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of signals the firm receives.  This is because the number of signals received provides
16:523:41683:18:18:71:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information about the signals the other firms received.  This in turn affects the behavior of
16:524:41776:18:18:71:540:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms and hence the optimal decision for firmf.  Note that any cutoff strategy is, by
16:525:41867:18:18:72:248:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:definition, an anonymous strategy.
16:526:41901:18:18:89:539:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While  we  defined  cutoffs  as  integers,  we  can  extend  the  definition  to  include  all  real
16:527:42001:18:17:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:numbers in the range (1,W) by letting a cutoffj+λ,whereλ∈(0,1),correspond to mixing

16:529:42155:18:18:89:539:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cutoff strategies are not only intuitive but alsooptimalstrategies for firms.  Whenever
16:530:42242:18:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms use anonymous strategies and workers signal to their most preferred firms, for
16:531:42332:18:18:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any strategy of firmfthere exists a cutoff strategy that provides firmfwith a weakly higher
16:532:42423:18:18:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected payoff (see Proposition A3).  This is due to the fact that the preferences of firms
16:533:42515:18:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and strategies of workers are symmetric.  Consequently, the probability that firmf’s offer
16:534:42605:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:toTforSfwill be accepted depends only on the number of signals firmfreceives, and not
16:535:42690:18:18:72:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the identity of the signaling workers.  Hence,  ifffinds it optimal to make an offer to

16:537:42872:18:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:receives is the same.  The equilibrium results in this paper will all involve firms using cutoff
16:538:42968:18:18:72:124:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies.
16:539:42979:18:18:89:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since  cutoff  strategies  can  be  represented  by  cutoff  vectors,  we  can  impose  a  natural

17:567:45286:30:18:71:539:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We have analyzed the unique equilibrium in the offer game with no signals,  and we have
17:568:45373:18:17:71:539:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:studied symmetric equilibria in markets with a signaling mechanism.  We focused on non-
17:569:45460:17:18:71:539:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:babbling equilibria where firms interpret signals of workers as a sign of interest, and hence
17:570:45553:18:18:71:539:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each worker sends a signal to her most preferred firm.  In this section we address the effect
17:571:45646:18:18:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of introducing a signaling mechanism on the market outcome.  We consider three outcome
17:572:45732:18:18:71:539:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures:  the  number  of  matches  in  the  market,  the  welfare  of  firms  and  the  welfare  of
17:573:45833:18:18:71:539:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers, where for agent welfare comparisons we consider Pareto ex-ante expected utility as
17:574:45924:18:18:71:138:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our criterion.
17:575:45938:18:18:89:539:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis begins with an incremental approach:  we first study the effect of a single
17:576:46026:18:18:71:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm increasing its cutoff, that is, responding more to signals.  We then rank various signaling
17:577:46122:18:18:71:539:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria in terms of their outcomes.  Finally, we address how the introduction of a signaling
17:578:46217:18:18:71:327:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism impacts the three measures of welfare.

17:582:46499:18:0:72:405:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:types.  In this section we restrict the analysis to cutoff strategies.
18:583:46571:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consider  the  offer  game  with  signals,  in  which  workers  send  their  signal  to  their  first

18:585:46768:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms, and assume that one firm changes its strategy to respond more to signals.  How
18:586:46859:18:24:72:456:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does this affect the number of matches, and the workers and firms welfare?

18:598:47792:28:18:89:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand the first result, observe that when firmfswitches its offer from its first
18:599:47880:18:18:72:539:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choice  workerTfto  its  most  preferred  signaling  workerSf,  it  is  the  other  offers  received
18:600:47980:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by these two workers that determine the impact on the total number of matches.  If both
18:601:48067:18:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers have other offers, or if neither has another offer, the number of matches is unaffected.
18:602:48163:18:17:72:538:322:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f13:Only when exactly one of these two workers has another offer doesf’s switch fromTftoSf
18:603:48249:17:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:affect the number of matches.  However, conditional on exactly one of these having another
18:604:48339:18:18:72:538:287:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f13:offer, it is weakly more likely to beTf, as this worker has signaled to another firm, whileSf
18:605:48432:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has not.  Furthermore,Tfisstrictlymore likely thanSfto have another offer when at least
18:606:48519:18:18:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one other firm responds to signals.  Hence, making an offer toSfleads to a greater expected
18:607:48610:18:18:72:201:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:total number of matches.
18:608:48634:18:18:89:539:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition to creating more matches in expectation, a firm responding more to signals
18:609:48720:18:18:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unambiguously increases expected worker welfare.  Note that when firmfchanges its offer
18:610:48807:18:18:72:538:179:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f13:fromTftoSf, then workerSfreceives an offer from her first choice firm, while workerTf
18:611:48892:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loses an offer from a firm she ranks second or worse.  Hence, when the number of matches is
18:612:48983:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unchanged, average worker welfare increases.  Furthermore, it is more likely that the number
18:613:49075:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of matches increases rather than decreases, and once more each match ‘gained’ is one where
18:614:49165:18:18:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a worker receives her first choice firm, while each match ‘lost’ is one where a worker receives
18:615:49260:18:17:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a firm of her second choice or worse.  It follows that in expectation, each worker gains when
18:616:49353:17:0:72:279:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a firm starts responding more to signals.
19:617:49396:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In contrast, a firmfresponding more to signals has a negative effect on the welfare of
19:618:49482:18:18:71:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms.  When firmfmakes an offer toTf, this offer may be rejected, asTfmay prefer
19:619:49569:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other firms to firmf.  But an offer fromftoSfcreates “stiff” competition for competing
19:620:49655:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms, since this worker will acceptf’s offer with certainty, and offers from other firms will
19:621:49749:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be rejected.  Additionally,f’s switch fromTftoSfmay only be pivotal for opponent firms
19:622:49835:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:making “risky” offers to their top ranked workers.  Such offers are more likely to be made
19:623:49925:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:toSfthan toTfsince by signaling,Sfhas indicated she prefersf.  Hence,  in addition to
19:624:50010:18:18:72:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creatingstiffercompetition for−f,f’s switch fromTftoSfcreatesmorecompetition for
19:625:50090:18:18:72:461:564:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:−f.  The combination of these two effects gives the negative spillover result.
19:626:50168:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now use the incremental welfare results to compare welfare across equilibria.  The
19:627:50253:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:following corollary states that for all three of our welfare measures, there is a clear ranking
19:628:50348:18:28:72:424:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of any two symmetric equilibria that can be ordered by their cutoffs.
19:629:50417:28:17:72:539:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:Corollary 1.Consider any two symmetric cutoff strategy equilibria where in one equilibrium
19:630:50507:17:18:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:firms have greater cutoffs (respond more to signals).  Compared to the equilibrium with lower
19:631:50600:18:18:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cutoffs, in the equilibrium with greater cutoffs we have the following:  (i) the expected number
19:632:50696:18:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of matches is weakly greater, (ii) workers have weakly higher expected payoffs, and (iii) firms
19:633:50791:18:28:72:251:411:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:have weakly lower expected payoffs.
19:634:50826:28:18:89:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:Corollary 1 states that firms and workers areopposedin their preferences over equilibria.18
19:635:50917:18:18:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When multiple symmetric equilibria exist, workers prefer the equilibrium that involves firms
19:636:51009:18:18:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responding the most to signals, that is the greatest cutoffs, while firms prefer the equilibrium
19:637:51105:18:18:72:191:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the lowest cutoffs.
19:638:51129:18:18:89:539:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We can now address the effect of adding a signaling mechanism to an offer game with
19:639:51212:18:18:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no signals.  We will assume that the equilibrium once the signaling mechanism is introduced
19:640:51303:18:18:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is one of the symmetric non-babbling equilibria.  Using the results above, we can show that
19:641:51394:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:introducing a signaling mechanism weakly increases the welfare of workers and the expected
19:642:51484:18:17:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of matches.  Furthermore, the inequality is strict if firms respond to signals at all;
19:643:51577:17:18:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that is, if for at least some number of signals, firms use strategies that call for an offer to a
19:644:51674:18:18:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker who signaled,Sf, even when she is not the first choice workerTf.  In contrast, firm
19:645:51764:18:18:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:welfare cannot be compared.  As the example in Section 2 illustrates, firm welfare may be
19:646:51853:18:18:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher with or without a signaling mechanism.  The following theorem encapsulates these
19:647:51940:18:26:72:109:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results.
19:648:51948:26:15:81:539:124:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:18Suppose that when we have a class of cutoff strategies that are strategically equivalent, we allow firms to
19:649:52057:15:12:72:539:109:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:only use the lowest one.  For example, when we haveWworkers, a firm withk >1 signals may have cutoffs
19:650:52158:12:12:72:539:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ofW−k+ 1 andW−k+ 2 that are strategically equivalent:  the firm always makes an offer toSf.  When
19:651:52255:12:0:72:502:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we focus on the lowest strategically equivalent cutoff, then all inequalities of Corollary 1 are strict.
20:652:52361:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:Theorem 2(Welfare).Consider any non-babbling symmetric equilibrium of the offer game
20:653:52445:18:18:71:539:690:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with signals in which for at least some number of signals, firm strategies call for an offer to
20:654:52540:18:18:71:540:672:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the signaling worker,Sf, even when she is not the first choice workerTf.  Then the following
20:655:52632:18:28:71:182:654:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:three statements hold.
20:656:52654:28:18:88:540:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:i.  The  expected  number  of  matches  is  strictly  greater  than  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of
20:657:52755:18:28:101:258:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the offer game with no signals.
20:658:52786:28:18:84:539:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ii.  The expected welfare of workers is strictly greater than in the unique equilibrium of the
20:659:52880:18:28:101:239:562:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:offer game with no signals.
20:660:52907:28:18:81:540:534:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:iii.  The  welfare  of  firms  may  be  greater  or  smaller  than  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of  the
20:661:53012:18:28:101:239:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:offer game with no signals.
20:662:53039:28:18:89:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When introducing a signaling mechanism hurts firm welfare, it is because the negative
20:663:53124:18:17:71:539:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externality outweighs the individual firm benefit from responding to signals.  The theorem
20:664:53214:17:18:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discusses the case in which firms respond to at least some degree to signals in equilibrium.
20:665:53306:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that when there is a symmetric non-babbling equilibrium where firms ignore signals,
20:666:53394:18:18:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then this equilibrium is outcome equivalent to a market without a signaling mechanism, so
20:667:53483:18:18:71:539:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that agents are no worse off with the signaling mechanism.  But provided firms respond even
20:668:53574:18:18:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:minimally  to  signals  in  equilibrium,  with  the  introduction  of  a  signaling  mechanism,  the
20:669:53674:18:45:71:536:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected number of matches and the expected welfare for workers increase unambiguously.

20:671:53783:30:18:71:539:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:So  far  we  assumed  that  worker  preferences  are  symmetric,  uniform  and  independent.   In
20:672:53880:18:18:71:539:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-babbling sequential equilibria, this implies that workers send their signal to their most
20:673:53973:18:18:71:539:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preferred  firm,  and  a  firm  that  received  a  signal  could  be  certain  that  an  offer  would  be
20:674:54078:18:18:71:539:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accepted.  In this section we relax the assumption that worker preferences are uncorrelated.
20:675:54170:18:18:71:539:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:More precisely, we consider a market where firms can be partitioned in blocks, so that all
20:676:54260:18:18:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers agree which block contains the most desirable firms, which block the second most
20:677:54348:18:18:71:539:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:desirable set of firms and so on.  However, within a block, workers may have idiosyncratic
20:678:54438:18:17:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preferences over firms.  Hence, for this section we consider markets where agent preferences
20:679:54530:17:28:71:172:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:areblock-correlated.

21:684:54822:18:28:101:211:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any firm in blockFb′;
21:685:54843:28:27:86:521:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.  Each worker’s preferences within each blockFbare uniform and independent; and
21:686:54924:27:27:86:442:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.  Each firm’s preferences over workers are uniform and independent.
21:687:54993:27:18:89:540:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  call  distributionst(·)  that  satisfy  the  criteria  in  Definition  6block  uniform.   The
21:688:55090:18:17:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:environment  analyzed  in  previous  sections  is  a  special  case  of  block-correlated  markets,
21:689:55189:17:18:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where there is only one block of firms.  Block-correlated markets are meant to capture the
21:690:55279:18:18:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:notion that many two-sided markets are segmented.  That is, workers may largely agree on
21:691:55367:18:18:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the ranking of blocks on the other side of the market, but vary in their preferences within
21:692:55458:18:18:72:540:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each block.  For example, workers might agree on the set of firms that constitute the “top
21:693:55548:18:18:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tier” of the market; however within that tier, preferences are influenced by factors specific
21:694:55641:18:18:72:150:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to each worker.
21:695:55656:18:18:89:539:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We again focus on equilibria where agents use anonymous strategies.  For firms we main-

21:697:55833:18:18:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:only consider permutationsPBthat permute firm orderings within blocks; that is, permu-

21:701:56103:27:18:89:539:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As previously, let us first consider the offer game with no signals. Since worker preferences
21:702:56196:18:17:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are still uniformly distributed there is again a unique equilibrium where firms use anonymous
21:703:56289:17:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies:  each firm optimally makes an offer to the highest-ranked worker on its preference
21:704:56383:18:18:72:91:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:list.
21:705:56388:18:18:89:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  now  turn  to  the  offer  game  with  signals,  where  we  will  be  interested  in  equilibria
21:706:56488:18:18:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where firms within each block play symmetric, anonymous strategies.  That is, if firmfand
21:707:56577:18:18:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firmf′belong to the same blockFb,for someb∈{1,...,B},they play the same anonymous
21:708:56658:18:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:strategies  and  have  the  same  beliefs.   We  call  such  firm  strategies  and  firm  beliefsblock-
21:709:56761:18:18:72:539:197:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:symmetric.  We denote equilibria where firm strategies and firm beliefs are block-symmetric
21:710:56852:18:18:72:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and worker strategies are anonymous and symmetric asblock-symmetric equilibria. Before we
21:711:56941:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can characterize the set of block-symmetric equilibria, we discuss the strategies of workers,
21:712:57034:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who  must  choose  whether  to  send  a  signal,  and  if  so,  to  which  firm.   In  block-symmetric
21:713:57136:18:18:72:539:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria,  firms within each blockFbuse the same anonymous strategies.  Hence,  we can
21:714:57224:18:18:72:539:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:denote  the  ex-ante  probability  of  a  workerwreceiving  an  offer  from  a  firm  in  blockFb,

21:716:57408:18:0:72:539:71:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f13:also denote the equilibrium probability that a worker sends her signal to a firm in blockFb

22:720:57581:14:18:71:310:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each worker may only send at most one signal.
22:721:57626:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The following proposition characterizes worker strategies in all block-symmetric sequen-

22:733:58406:31:18:89:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Proposition 4 states that there are two types of block-symmetric equilibria that satisfy
22:734:58494:18:18:71:539:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Criterion  D1.   Equilibria  of  the  first  type  are  babbling,  where  firms  ignore  signals.   The
22:735:58597:18:18:71:539:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes of these equilibria coincide with the outcome in the offer games with no signals.
22:736:58687:18:18:71:410:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consequently, the signaling mechanism adds no value in this case.
22:737:58752:18:18:89:539:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In equilibria of the second type, workers send signals only to their most preferred firm in
22:738:58843:18:18:71:539:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each block, possibly mixing across these top firms.  We show that in equilibrium workers only
22:739:58936:18:18:71:539:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send signals to blocks in which firms respond to signals, that is the chances of receiving an
22:740:59029:18:18:71:539:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer from the firm they signaled to is higher than if they had not sent that signal.  Moreover,
22:741:59125:18:18:71:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if in equilibrium workerwis not prescribed to signal to some blockFb′, thenw’s choice of
22:742:59213:18:17:71:540:234:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:αb′= 0 is optimal for any beliefs of firms in blockFb′.  In particular, this strategy would be
22:743:59307:17:18:71:540:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimal even if firms in blockFb′interpreted signals in the most favorable way for worker

22:746:59514:18:18:89:539:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We call all strategies where a worker who sends a signal to firms in blockbsends it to

22:749:59806:16:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the proof of Proposition 4 for the definition of our analog of Criterion D1 of Cho and Kreps (1987).  Other
22:750:59913:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:refinements could also be used in our equilibrium characterization:  for example, we could replace Criterion
22:751:60021:12:11:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:D1  with  “universal  divinity”  of  Banks  and  Sobel  (1987)  or  by  “never  a  weak  best  response”  of  Cho  and
22:752:60139:11:0:72:394:76:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Kreps (1987) without making a change to the statement of Proposition 4.

23:755:60398:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies and that firms have best-in-block beliefs,  and examine firm offers in the second
23:756:60490:18:18:72:173:654:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:stage of the game.20
23:757:60510:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important difference between the single block and multi-block settings is that when
23:758:60596:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there are multiple blocks, offers to workers who have signaled are no longer guaranteed to
23:759:60686:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be accepted.  This is because a firm that receives a signal knows that while it is the worker’s
23:760:60781:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:most preferred firm in the block, the worker may receive an offer from a firm in a superior
23:761:60872:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:block. Nevertheless, several results about the strategies of firms carry over when we introduce
23:762:60967:18:18:72:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:block correlation.  In a block-correlated market, firmf’s offer choice is again reduced to a
23:763:61059:18:18:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:binary decision betweenTfandSf, provided workers use symmetric best-in-block strategies
23:764:61146:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and firms−fuse anonymous strategies.  Under these same conditions, cutoff strategies are
23:765:61234:18:18:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:again  optimal  forf.   The  strategic  complements  result  of  Proposition  2  also  carries  over;

23:769:61545:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The next result establishes the existence of equilibria in block correlated settings in the

23:772:61820:18:28:72:307:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result to show that this step is not restrictive.
23:773:61869:28:18:72:544:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:Theorem 3(Equilibrium Existence under Block Correlation).There exists a block-symmetric
23:774:61956:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:equilibrium where 1) workers play symmetric best-in-block strategies, and 2) firms play block-
23:775:62050:18:28:72:212:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:symmetric cutoff strategies.
23:776:62078:28:18:89:539:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In contrast to Theorem 1 which established equilibrium existence when there is a single
23:777:62165:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:block,  equilibria  here  may  involve  mixed  strategies  for  workers;  that  is,  each  worker  may
23:778:62267:18:17:72:330:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signal with positive probability to multiple blocks.
23:779:62319:17:18:89:539:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The final result of the section extends the welfare results of Theorem 2.  Note that for
23:780:62407:18:18:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the comparisons in the theorem to be strict, we require a block with at least two firms where
23:781:62500:18:18:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in equilibrium, workers send signals with positive probability to that block.  Without this
23:782:62591:18:28:72:292:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:condition, we only have weak comparisons.
23:783:62632:28:16:81:539:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:20Note that firms have best-in-block beliefs on the equilibrium path in any block-symmetric equilibrium.
23:784:62736:16:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In  addition,  a  block-symmetric  equilibrium  satisfies  Criterion  D1  if  and  only  if  worker  strategies  remain
23:785:62855:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:optimal if firm off-equilibrium beliefs were best-in-block beliefs.  Hence,  we will focus on equilibria where
23:786:62965:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:firms have best-in-block beliefs even off the equilibrium path.  See the proof of Proposition 4 in Appendix

24:791:63289:28:18:88:540:644:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:i.  The  expected  number  of  matches  is  strictly  greater  than  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of
24:792:63390:18:28:101:258:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the offer game with no signals.
24:793:63421:28:18:84:539:598:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ii.  The expected welfare of workers is strictly greater than in the unique equilibrium of the
24:794:63515:18:28:101:239:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:offer game with no signals.
24:795:63542:28:18:81:540:552:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:iii.  The  welfare  of  firms  may  be  greater  or  smaller  than  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of  the
24:796:63647:18:28:101:239:534:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:offer game with no signals.
24:797:63674:28:18:89:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that while the welfare comparisons with and without a signaling mechanism gener-
24:798:63759:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alize to block correlated markets, the welfare comparisons across equilibria (see Corollary 1)
24:799:63853:18:17:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do not generalize.  In particular, when there are multiple blocks, when a single firm responds
24:800:63947:17:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more to signals, firms in lower ranked blocks may benefit.  Hence, we no longer see a purely
24:801:64039:18:18:72:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:negative spillover on other firms, which was a key step in establishing the welfare ranking.21
24:802:64133:18:18:89:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, even when workers have correlated preferences, so that receiving a signal does
24:803:64220:18:18:71:539:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not translate to a guaranteed match for a firm, we find that introducing a signaling mecha-
24:804:64311:18:45:71:505:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nism increases the expected number of matches and the expected welfare of workers.

24:807:64454:29:18:71:539:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this section, we analyze the effects of introducing a signaling mechanism across different
24:808:64547:18:18:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market structures.  More precisely, we study the increase in the expected number of matches
24:809:64638:18:18:71:326:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:due to the introduction of a signaling mechanism.
24:810:64687:18:18:89:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To isolate the impact of a signaling mechanism on the number of matches in the market,
24:811:64773:18:18:71:539:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we consider a special case where agents want to match, but are nearly indifferent over whom
24:812:64864:18:18:71:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they  match  with.   That  is,  firms  (and  workers)  play  an  (almost)pure  coordinationgame
24:813:64959:18:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amongst themselves.  Specifically, we consider the cardinal utility from being matched to a
24:814:65050:18:18:72:539:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partner  as  beingalmostthe  same  across  partners.   If  agentahas  a  preference  profileθa,

24:819:65231:23:16:81:539:117:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:21Since offers to workers who have signaled are no longer guaranteed to be accepted, firms making offers
24:820:65335:16:12:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f20:to signaling workers may be affected byf’s switch fromTftoSf.  In particular, firms in thesame or higher
24:821:65439:12:12:71:539:89:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:blocks responding to signals will not be affected, but firms in lower blocks responding to signalspreferthat
24:822:65547:12:0:71:540:77:10:g_d0_f20:10:g_d0_f6:fswitch fromTftoSf.  There is a positive spillover on these firms, and negative spillover on all other firms.
25:823:65658:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the difference between utility intensities is very small.22In addition, there is only one block
25:824:65753:18:18:72:389:690:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:of firms, so that agent preferences are uniformly distributed.23
25:825:65817:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Under these assumptions, there is a unique non-babbling symmetric equilibrium in the
25:826:65901:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer game with signals.  Each worker sends a signal to her most preferred firm.  Each firm
25:827:65992:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:makes an offer to its most preferred worker that has signaled provided the firm receives at
25:828:66083:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:least one signal; otherwise, it makes an offer to its top-ranked worker (see Proposition B1).24
25:829:66178:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Proposition 1 also applies in this setting; that is, there is a unique equilibrium of the offer
25:830:66273:18:18:72:183:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:game with no signals.
25:831:66294:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We denote the expected number of matches in the unique equilibrium in the pure coor-

25:835:66632:18:18:72:538:492:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f9:nism, we denote asV(F,W)≡mS(F,W)−mNS(F,W).  Figure 1 graphs 100·V(F,W)/W

25:838:66862:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of matches proportional to the size of the side of the market we keep fixed (which
25:839:66951:18:18:71:405:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:places an upper bound on the total number of possible matches).
25:840:67014:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The figures suggest that the value of a signaling mechanism is single peaked when varying
25:841:67103:18:18:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one side of the market and holding the other constant.  That is, it seems that a signaling
25:842:67193:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism is most beneficial for balanced markets — markets where the the number of firms
25:843:67282:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the number of workers are roughly of the same magnitude.  To understand why signaling
25:844:67371:18:18:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may be useful in balanced markets, it is helpful to think about the endpoints.  With many
25:845:67460:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers and very few firms, firms will almost certainly match with or without the signaling
25:846:67551:18:21:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism, as there is no large coordination problem.  With many firms and few workers,
25:847:67638:21:7:81:367:274:7:g_d0_f5:7:g_d0_f12:22The “nearly indifferent” condition for firms is thatu(W)>W

25:856:67841:12:9:71:261:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of the setup can be found in Appendix B.2.
25:857:67883:9:15:81:539:235:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:23Our pure coordination model has similarities to the “urn-ball” model in the labor literature, concisely
25:858:67988:15:12:71:539:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:described in a survey by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001):  “Firms play the role of urns and workers play the
25:859:68097:12:12:71:539:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:role of balls.  An urn becomes “productive” when it has ball in it.  [. . . ]  In the simplest version of this process
25:860:68215:12:12:71:540:196:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f6:Uworkers know exactly the location ofVjob vacancies and send one application each.  If a vacancy receives
25:861:68320:12:12:71:539:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:one or more applications it selects an applicant at random and forms a match.  The other applicants are
25:862:68423:12:12:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:returned to the pool of unemployed workers to apply again.” Our pure coordination model effectively flips
25:863:68528:12:12:71:539:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the urn-ball problem around.  Workers apply to all jobs, and firms propose the offers.  We have a non-random
25:864:68636:12:12:71:539:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:selection procedure, and of course in our model we study the role of signaling.  Perhaps the paper with the
25:865:68743:12:8:71:364:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:closest market structure to ours is Julien, Kennes and King (2000).
25:866:68810:8:16:81:539:128:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:24In  this  case,  one  can  view  the  offer  game  with  no  signals  as  the  result  of  the  first  round  of  a  firm-
25:867:68934:16:12:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:proposing deferred acceptance algorithm.  When workers send signals, the result resembles one round of a
25:868:69038:12:12:71:539:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:worker-proposing deferred acceptance with one exception:  firms who received no offer (no signal from any
25:869:69143:12:0:71:212:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:worker) do get to make an offer.

26:911:69467:14:15:200:470:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of matches due to a signaling mechanism as
26:912:69516:15:14:200:470:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  vary  the  number  of  firms  for  a  fixed  number  of
26:913:69575:14:36:200:461:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers (left graphs) and vice versa (right graphs).
26:914:69627:36:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  reverse  holds:  most  workers  will  get  offers  with  or  without  the  signaling  mechanism.
26:915:69728:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence, the signaling mechanism offers little benefit at the extremes.  Furthermore, Figure 1
26:916:69820:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggests that the proportional increase in the expected number of matches remains steady as
26:917:69911:18:17:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market size increases, holding constant the ratio of workers to firms.  Proposition 5 describes
26:918:70006:17:28:72:215:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these observations precisely.
26:919:70035:28:18:72:539:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:Proposition 5(Balanced Markets).Consider markets with F firms and W workers.  Then

26:922:70274:17:28:72:167:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:wherey0≈1.8442.
26:923:70289:28:18:89:540:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The proof of Proposition 5 involves the calculation of an explicit formula forV(F,W).
26:924:70374:18:34:72:434:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The expected increase in the number of matches can be represented as
26:925:70442:34:0:232:305:184:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:V(F,W) =α(

26:933:70479:0:26:315:383:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:)W+OW(1),
26:934:70488:26:18:72:539:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whereα(·) andβ(·) are particular functions andOW(1) andOF(1) denote functions that
26:935:70570:18:17:72:539:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  smaller  than  a  constant  for  largeWand  for  largeFrespectively.   Hence,V(F,W)  is
26:936:70662:17:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“almost” homogeneous of degree one for large markets.  That is, the proportional increase
27:937:70753:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the number of matches,V(F,W)/WandV(F,W)/F,  is almost homogenous of degree
27:938:70830:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:zero.25As a consequence, we can evaluate the introduction of the signaling mechanism for a
27:939:70920:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample market, and its properties will be preserved for markets of other sizes, but with the
27:940:71012:18:18:72:228:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:same ratio of firms to workers.
27:941:71043:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  example,  we  can  use  Figure  1  to  investigate  maximal  quantitative  gains  from  the
27:942:71139:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:introduction of the signaling mechanism in large markets.  For a fixed number of workers,
27:943:71228:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the maximum increase in expected number of matches is approximately 15%.  Furthermore,
27:944:71314:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the returns to the signaling mechanism are substantial over a wide range of market conditions.
27:945:71408:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For example, only when the number of firms outweighs the number of workers by more than
27:946:71495:18:45:72:495:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fourfold do the gains from introducing the signaling mechanism drop to below 1%.
27:947:71575:45:30:72:326:501:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:8    Discussion and Conclusion
27:948:71605:30:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Excessive applications by job market candidates lead to market congestion:  employers must
27:949:71695:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:devote resources to evaluate and pursue potential candidates, but cannot give due attention
27:950:71786:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to all.  Evaluation is further complicated because employers must assess which applicants,
27:951:71876:18:17:72:525:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many of whom are performing broad searches, are likely to ultimately accept a job offer.
27:952:71964:17:18:89:539:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consequently,  applicants are  often  eager  to convey  information  about  their  interest  in
27:953:72059:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular employers, and employers stand ready to act upon such information, if it can be
27:954:72149:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deemed credible.  However, in many markets indicating preferences is cheap, and employers
27:955:72238:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may struggle to identify which preference information is sincere.  This, in turn, may prevent
27:956:72331:18:18:72:407:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any potential gains from preference signaling from being realized.
27:957:72397:18:18:89:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper we examined how a signaling mechanism can overcome this credibility prob-
27:958:72484:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lem and improve agent welfare.  In our model, workers are allowed to send a costless signal
27:959:72575:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to a single firm.  While participation is free and voluntary, this mechanism nevertheless pro-
27:960:72669:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vides workers with a means of credibly expressing preferences.  In a symmetric setting where
27:961:72761:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agent preferences are uncorrelated, workers will send their signal to their most preferred firm.
27:962:72857:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Firms use this information as guidance, optimally using cutoff strategies to make offers.  We
27:963:72950:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find that on average, introducing a signaling technology increases both the expected number
27:964:73041:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of matches as well as the expected welfare of workers.  The welfare of firms,  on the other
27:965:73132:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hand, changes ambiguously, because firms responding more to signals may impose a negative
27:966:73221:17:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externality on other firms.  The results carry over when we consider a model where firms
27:967:73309:18:18:72:380:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have many positions, and workers can send multiple signals.
27:968:73368:18:16:81:539:113:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:25Note that this result corroborates the stylized fact in the empirical labor literature that the matching
27:969:73474:16:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:function (the expected number of matches) has a constant return to scale.  See, for example, Petrongolo and
27:970:73581:12:0:72:325:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Pissarides (2001) or Rogerson, Shimer and Wright (2005).
28:971:73639:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We showed that the results hold even when workers have correlated preferences, where
28:972:73723:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers  agree  on  the  ranking  of  blocks  of  firms  but  vary  in  their  preferences  within  each
28:973:73827:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:block.  In this case firm offers to workers who have signaled will not result in guaranteed
28:974:73918:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:acceptance.  This is because workers will no longer send their signal to their most preferred
28:975:74011:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm, but rather will mix among the most preferred firms from each block.  We showed further
28:976:74103:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that introducing a signaling mechanism adds the most value for balanced markets, that is,
28:977:74192:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markets in which the number of firms and the number of workers are of roughly the same
28:978:74278:18:18:72:129:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:magnitude.
28:979:74288:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One path for future research would be to characterize the full set of agent preferences
28:980:74375:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where signaling is beneficial.  While in this paper we find that signaling mechanisms can im-
28:981:74468:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prove agent welfare under a broad class of preferences, for some agent preferences signaling
28:982:74560:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can worsen outcomes.  Kushnir (2009) models a high-information setting with minimal con-
28:983:74648:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gestion where signals disturb firms’ commonly held beliefs about workers preferences, which
28:984:74739:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in turn disrupts the maximal matching.  Kushnir’s example corroborates the intuition that
28:985:74828:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals may be more useful in low information settings than in high.  Further investigation
28:986:74919:18:18:72:241:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of this question could be fruitful.
28:987:74954:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Another interesting question that is beyond the scope of the current paper concerns the
28:988:75041:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimal  signaling  mechanism.   Providing  candidates  with  one,  or  else  a  small  number  of
28:989:75139:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:identical signals offers a tractable approach, and participants may value its simplicity.  But
28:990:75233:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:within the realm of mechanisms that offer candidates equal numbers of identical signals, how
28:991:75325:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do we identify the optimal number of signals,  especially in light of the fact that multiple
28:992:75417:18:18:72:336:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilbria may exist?  And might we do even better?
28:993:75467:18:18:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If we expand the class of mechanisms under study,  we can potentially improve perfor-
28:994:75552:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mance  even  more.   For  example,  the  signaling  mechanism  that  maximizes  the  number  of
28:995:75647:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:matches may be asymmetric.  Consider the example in Section 2, with two firms and two
28:996:75732:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers.   In  the  example,  each  worker  had  exactly  one  signal.   If  both  workers  have  and
28:997:75833:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send two signals that are identical, outcomes are as if each had no signal.  If we offered each
28:998:75928:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker two distinct signals, e.g.  a ‘gold’ and a ‘silver’ signal, analysis is as if they had one
28:999:76025:18:18:72:131:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signal each.
28:1000:76037:18:18:89:539:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Asymmetric signaling capacities, however, can generate a full matching.  Suppose that
28:1001:76122:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one worker has a gold signal, while the other has two silver signals.  Suppose further that
28:1002:76213:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms are indifferent between the two workers.  Then one equilibrium involves the first worker
28:1003:76307:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sending its gold signal to its preferred firm.  The firm that receives the gold signal will make
28:1004:76403:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the signaling worker an offer, while the firm who receives no gold signal will make an offer
28:1005:76495:18:18:72:518:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the worker who sent a silver signal.  Both firms and workers will always be matched.

29:1008:76774:18:18:72:117:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:research.
29:1009:76783:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We wish to highlight that a signaling mechanism has the potential to improve outcomes
29:1010:76868:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in congested markets.  Importantly, since signaling mechanisms are free, voluntary, and built
29:1011:76961:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  top  of  existing  labor  markets,  these  improvements  come  in  a  reasonably  non-invasive
29:1012:77059:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:manner.  As opposed to a central clearinghouse, as in the National Resident Matching Pro-

29:1014:77237:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requires significantly less intervention.  Market designers may find it easier to get consensus

29:1021:77686:25:18:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This portion of the appendix covers proofs for Sections 3-5.  In this setup workers may send
29:1022:77778:18:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at most one signal, and there is a single block of firms.  We omit proofs of Propositions 1
29:1023:77869:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and 2 and Theorem 2 as these are special cases of Propositions A1 and A4 and Theorem 4
29:1024:77955:18:30:72:134:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:respectively.
29:1025:77968:30:17:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Proof of Theorem 1.As discussed in Section 4, in any symmetric non-babbling equilibrium
29:1026:78055:17:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each worker sends its signal to its most preferred firm.  Consequently, all information sets
29:1027:78147:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for firms are realized with positive probability, so firm beliefs are determined by Bayes’ Law:
29:1028:78242:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if a firm receives a signal from a worker, it believes that worker ranks the firm first in its
29:1029:78336:18:18:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preference list.  We now take these worker strategies and firm beliefs as fixed, and analyze
29:1030:78428:18:18:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the second stage of the game when firms choose offers.  We will show that this reduced game
29:1031:78519:18:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is a supermodular game, and then use the results of Milgrom and Roberts (1990) to prove
29:1032:78606:18:18:72:138:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our theorem.
29:1033:78618:18:18:89:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We analyze the game where we restrict firm strategies to be cutoff strategies.  Denote
29:1034:78704:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the set of cutoff strategy profiles as Σcut, with typical elementσ= (σ1,...,σF).  Recall that
29:1035:78797:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a cutoff strategy for firmfis a vectorσf= (j1f,...,jWf) wherejkfcorresponds to the cutoff

29:1043:79141:18:0:71:354:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partial order is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
30:1044:79201:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To show that the second stage is a game with strategic complementarities, we need to
30:1045:79285:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:verify thatEθ(πf(σf,σ−f,θ)) is supermodular inσf, and thatEθ(πf(σf,σ−f,θ)) has increas-

30:1048:79553:18:18:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:cutoff vector component.  Namely, if we considerσ1f= (...,jl,...,jk,...), σ2f= (...,j′l,...,jk,...),
30:1049:79653:18:33:72:476:618:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:σ3f= (...,jl,...,j′k,...), andσ4f= (...,j′l,...,j′k,...) for somel,k∈{1,...,W},then

30:1052:79891:18:32:72:497:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.  Namely, for anyσf, σ−f, σ′f, andσ′−fsuch thatσ′f≥σfandσ′−f≥σ−fwe have

30:1054:80036:33:18:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence  the  second  stage  of  the  game,  when  firms  choose  their  strategies,  is  a  game  with

30:1058:80350:28:18:75:539:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Proof of Proposition 3.  The first two results, increase in the expected number of matches
30:1059:80440:18:18:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and positive spillover on workers, are demonstrated in the proof of Theorem 4 in Section 6
30:1060:80530:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(which considers a more general assumption on agent preferences). To avoid repetition, we do
30:1061:80622:18:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not present the proofs here.  However, the third result, that responding to signals generates
30:1062:80715:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  negative  spillover  on  opponent  firms,  is  unique  to  the  case  when  agent  preferences  are
30:1063:80817:18:18:72:344:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uniformly distributed, so we present the proof below.
30:1064:80870:18:18:89:539:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let  firmfstrategyσfdiffer  fromσ′fin  thatσ′fhas  weakly  greater  cutoffs.   Consider
30:1065:80957:18:18:72:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some firmf′∈−f.  For each preference listθf′and set of signals receivedWS, firmf′either
30:1066:81044:18:18:72:538:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:makes an offer toSf′(θf′,WS) orTf′(θf′,WS).  Observe that a change in strategy of firmf
30:1067:81131:18:18:72:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does not affectf′’s payoff from makingSf′an offer.  This follows since each worker sends
30:1068:81219:18:17:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:her  signal  to  her  most  preferred  firm,  so  offers  to  signaling  workers  are  always  accepted.
30:1069:81323:17:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, as shown in the proof of Proposition 2, the probability thatTf′accepts firmf′’s
30:1070:81411:18:18:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer weakly decreases.  Hence, overall the expected payoff of firmf′∈−fweakly decreases
30:1071:81499:18:29:72:539:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f25:when firmfresponds more to signals:Eθ(πf′(σf,σ−f,θ))≥Eθ(πf′(σ′f,σ−f,θ)).-

31:1076:81936:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:third result of Proposition 3 with a simple equilibrium property.Consider two symmetric
31:1077:82023:18:18:72:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria,  where  firms  play  cutoff  strategiesσandσ′,  withσ′≥σ.   From  the  definition
31:1078:82116:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of an equilibrium strategy we haveEθ[πf(σf,σ−f,θ)]≥Eθ[πf(σ′f,σ−f,θ)].The third result
31:1079:82201:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of Proposition 3 yieldsEθ[πf(σ′f,σ−f,θ)]≥Eθ[πf(σ′f,σ′−f,θ)].Combining these inequalities
31:1080:82289:18:39:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f25:yieldsEθ[πf(σf,σ−f,θ)]≥Eθ[πf(σ′f,σ′−f,θ)].-

32:1105:84197:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agents except workerwand firmf,which we denote asσ−f,w.  Fix also the beliefs of firms
32:1106:84283:18:18:71:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  than  firmf,  which  we  denote  asμ−f.   We  now  analyze  strategies  of  workerwand
32:1107:84376:18:18:71:235:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies and beliefs for firmf.
32:1108:84409:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There are two cases where information sets for firms might be reached with zero prob-
32:1109:84494:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ability (lie “off the equilibrium path”) in a block-symmetric equilibrium.  First,  when the
32:1110:84586:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:symmetric worker equilibrium strategy prescribes zero probability of sending a signal to a
32:1111:84676:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular block, firms in these blocks would view signals from such workers as “unexpected.”
32:1112:84769:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, when a firm anticipates receiving a signal with 100% probability, thennotreceiving
32:1113:84859:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a  signal  would  correspond  to  an  off-equilibrium  information  set.   But  by  the  anonymous
32:1114:84957:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies  assumption,  this  can  only  happen  in  a  block-symmetric  equilibrium  if  the  firm
32:1115:85057:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is the only one in its block.  In this case, the symmetry of worker strategies would ensure
32:1116:85148:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that all workers send their signals to this firm with probability 1.  Since signals then would
32:1117:85242:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not transmit information about worker types,  this equilibrium is outcome equivalent to a
32:1118:85331:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:babbling  equilibrium.   We  will  concentrate  on  the  first  type  of  off-equilibrium  messages  –
32:1119:85433:18:18:71:182:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“unexpected” signals.

33:1144:86925:18:17:71:540:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a signal from her).  Using the above notation, we now state our analog of criterionD1 as
33:1145:87013:17:24:71:109:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:follows:
33:1146:87021:24:18:71:539:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Criterion  D1.  Fix strategies of workers−wand strategies and beliefs of firms−f.  If for

33:1149:87233:24:18:71:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  intuition  behind  this  criterion  is  that  whenever  typetof  workerweither  wishes  to
33:1150:87328:18:18:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:defect and send an off-equilibrium signal to firmfor is indifferent,  some other typet′of
33:1151:87417:18:18:71:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workerwstrictly wishes to defect.  When we prunetfor workerwfrom firmf’s beliefs, we
33:1152:87501:18:18:71:539:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are interpreting that firmffinds it infinitely more likely that the off-equilibrium signal has
33:1153:87595:18:18:71:255:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:come from typet′than from typet.
33:1154:87627:18:18:89:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We first show that there cannot be ablock-symmetricsequential equilibrium that satisfies
33:1155:87715:18:17:71:539:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Criterion D1 where sending a signal to a firm in some blockFb, b∈ {1,...,B}reducesthe
33:1156:87800:17:18:71:298:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likelihood of receiving an offer, i.e.psb< pnsb.
33:1157:87848:18:18:89:539:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let  us  assume  that  such  a  block-symmetric  sequential  equilibrium  exists.   If  there  are
33:1158:87946:18:18:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at least two workers, agents use anonymous block-symmetric strategies, and agents’ types
33:1159:88034:18:18:71:539:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are uncorrelated, each worker is unmatched with positive probability.  Then in equilibrium,
33:1160:88125:18:18:71:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:certainly no worker sends her signal to a firm within blockFb; she’d prefer to simply send
33:1161:88215:18:18:71:539:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no signal at all.  Hence, it must be that a signal would reduce the probability of an offer for
33:1162:88310:18:18:71:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms in some block not signaled in equilibrium.  Following the definition ofDt,  whenever
33:1163:88400:18:18:71:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it  would  be  beneficial  for  some  typeθw∈Θwto  deviate  from  the  equilibrium  path  and
33:1164:88493:18:18:71:539:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:send her signal to firmf(which would require firmfmaking an offer to workerw), then it
33:1165:88579:18:18:71:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would be beneficial for any typeθ′w∈Θwof workerwsuch that firmfisw’s most preferred
33:1166:88662:18:18:71:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm within blockFb, to similarly deviate.  Therefore, the only types (preference profiles) of
33:1167:88756:18:18:71:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workerwthat are not pruned in firms’ beliefs according to Criterion D1 are those where firm
33:1168:88847:18:17:71:540:89:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:fisw’s most preferred firm within blockFb.  Hence, given these beliefs, if it is optimal for

34:1171:89116:18:18:71:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:initial assumption, and hencepsb0< pnsb0cannot be part of any block-symmetric sequential
34:1172:89204:18:18:71:270:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium that satisfies Criterion D1.
34:1173:89244:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  have  established  thatpsb≥pnsbfor  eachb=  1,...,B.   It  is  easy  to  observe  that
34:1174:89334:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there exists a block-symmetric sequential equilibrium that satisfies Criterion D1 where for
34:1175:89425:18:18:71:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:anyb=  1,...,B, psb=pnsb.   For  example,  each  worker  may  randomize  her  signal  across
34:1176:89517:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all  firms  with  equal  probability,  independently  of  her  preferences,  and  firms  simply  play
34:1177:89618:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  equilibrium  strategies  of  the  offer  game  with  no  signals.   The  equilibrium  beliefs  are
34:1178:89721:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trivially block-uniform since when a firm receives a signal from workerw, its beliefs coincide
34:1179:89815:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  the  priors.   Since  all  blocks  are  reached  with  positive  probability  in  equilibrium,  no
34:1180:89919:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:off-equilibrium beliefs need be specified, and the equilibrium trivially satisfies Criterion D1.
34:1181:90015:18:18:89:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us now consider the case when there existsb0∈ {1,...,B},such thatpsb0> pnsb0in
34:1182:90097:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some block-symmetric sequential equilibrium.  Recall that the equilibrium probability that
34:1183:90187:18:8:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a worker sends her signal to a firm within blockFbis denoted asαb,whereαb∈[0,1] and

34:1185:90272:13:14:84:539:453:8:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:b=1αb≤1.  Let us consider some blockFb(6=Fb0) such thatαb>0.  As mentioned,  if
34:1186:90351:14:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there are at least two workers, agents use anonymous block-symmetric strategies, and agents’
34:1187:90443:18:18:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:types are uncorrelated, each worker is unmatched with positive probability in equilibrium.
34:1188:90533:18:18:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Therefore,αb>0 andpsb=pnsbare incompatible in an equilibrium (workerwcan benefit by
34:1189:90616:18:18:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaling to blockFb0rather than blockFb).  Hence, ifpsb> pnsbthen if workerwplans to

34:1191:90792:18:18:71:318:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this delivers the greatest expected payoff to her.
34:1192:90842:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Now suppose there is some blockFb′,b′∈ {1,...,B},such thatαb′=  0.Consider the

34:1196:91153:18:18:89:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We will first rule out the former case.  Suppose there exists typet∈Θwof workerwsuch

34:1199:91409:18:18:71:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:payoff.  However, any firmfoffer that delivers payoff exceeding equilibrium payoff for worker
34:1200:91502:18:18:71:540:188:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:wof typet, also delivers payoff exceeding equilibrium payoff for a workerwof typet′which

34:1202:91685:18:33:71:308:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beliefs that survive Criterion D1 are such that

35:1211:92159:18:18:89:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us now consider the case where for any typet∈Θw, we haveDt=∅.  That is, it

35:1219:92872:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Sobel (1990).  The assumption of monotonicity is satisfied in our environment because

37:1317:98440:18:18:89:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Select some firmffrom blockFb.  Using a construction similar to that in the proof of
37:1318:98524:18:27:72:349:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Lemma A1 we consider two sets of preference profiles:
37:1319:98577:27:18:189:421:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8: ̄Θ+≡{θ∈Θ|m(σ0f,σ−f,θ)< m(σf,σ−f,θ)}
37:1320:98613:18:33:189:424:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9: ̄Θ−≡{θ∈Θ|m(σ0f,σ−f,θ)> m(σf,σ−f,θ)}.
37:1321:98650:33:18:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consider some realized profile of preferences,θ∈Θ,and denoteTf=w′andSf=w.  Define
37:1322:98731:18:18:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mappingψ:  Θ→Θ  so  thatψ(θ)  is  the  profile  in  which  workers  have  preferences  as  in
37:1323:98824:18:18:72:539:119:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:θ, but firms−fall swap the positions of workersw′andwin their preference lists.  Note
37:1324:98909:18:18:72:539:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thatψ(ψ(θ))  =θandψis a bijection on Θ.  A direct consequence of Lemma A1 is that
37:1325:98990:18:0:72:463:83:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:| ̄Θ+|≥| ̄Θ−|.  Let us now show that there existθ∈ ̄Θ+such thatψ(θ)/∈ ̄Θ−.
38:1326:99066:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There are at least two firms,fandf′, in blockFbthat respond to signals.  Consider some
38:1327:99152:18:18:72:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:profileθfrom ̄Θ+.  We again denoteTf=w′andSf=w.  Therefore, workerwdoes not
38:1328:99227:18:18:71:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have an offer from any other firm for profileθfrom ̄Θ+, but workerw′has at least two offers.
38:1329:99319:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since workerw′sends her signal to firmf′with positive probability and firmf′responds to
38:1330:99406:18:18:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals, i.e.  makes offers to its top signaling workers, there existθ∗∈ ̄Θ+such that worker
38:1331:99498:18:18:71:487:618:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:w′is the top signaling worker of firmf′, and firmf′makes an offer to workerw′.
38:1332:99576:18:18:89:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, workerwfor profileψ(θ∗) does not have any other offer, because she is neither

38:1334:99751:18:33:71:530:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a profile from ̄Θ+that does not belong to ̄Θ−.  As a result,| ̄Θ+|>| ̄Θ−|and we have that

38:1336:99874:32:33:72:205:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition, we know that
38:1337:99899:33:33:210:401:466:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Eθ[m(σ0f,σ0−f,θ)]≤Eθ[m(σ0f,σ−f,θ)],
38:1338:99934:33:18:72:145:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which gives us
38:1339:99948:18:26:210:401:415:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Eθ[m(σ0f,σ0−f,θ)]< Eθ[m(σf,σ−f,θ)].
38:1340:99983:26:18:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Overall,  the  expected  number  of  matches  in  the  offer  game  with  signals  when  agents  use
38:1341:100083:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies (σF,σW) is strictly greater than the expected number of matches in the offer game
38:1342:100175:18:18:72:152:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with no signals.
38:1343:100191:18:18:89:539:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using  the  above  construction  and  the  logic  of  the  proof  of  Lemma  A1  we  obtain  the
38:1344:100287:18:17:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result for worker welfare.  The example presented in Section 2 illustrates that signals can
38:1345:100378:17:18:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ambiguously  influence  the  welfare  of  firms.   Specifically,  Table  2  shows  that  firm  welfare
38:1346:100480:18:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases upon introduction of a signaling mechanism only if the value of a second ranked

49:1755:120431:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability that firmf’s offer to workerwis accepted is smaller when firmf′uses strategy

49:1758:120650:18:0:71:422:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hence, our construction is an injective function from ̄Θ+to ̄Θ−, so

49:1767:120742:21:33:71:290:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:profilesθandθ′are equally likely, we have
49:1768:120783:33:33:98:513:370:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Eθ(mf(Tf,σ−f,θ)|θf=θ∗f,WSf=WS)≥Eθ(mf(Tf,σ′−f,θ)|θf=θ∗f,WSf=WS).
49:1769:120846:33:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  now  prove  inequalityII).  That  is,  we  will  show  that  if  firmf′responds  more  to
49:1770:120939:18:18:71:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals,  the probability of firmfbeing matched toSf(upon makingSfan offer) weakly
49:1771:121021:18:18:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases.  If firmf, f∈Fb,receives a signal from workerwit believes it is the best firm in
49:1772:121112:18:17:71:538:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:blockFbaccording to workerw’s preferences.  That is, workerwprefers the offer of firmf
49:1773:121198:17:18:71:539:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to an offer from any other firmf′from any blockFb′withb′≥b.  Therefore, the change of
49:1774:121283:18:18:71:504:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the behavior of any firmf′from blockFb′,b′≥b,does not influence firmf’s payoff.
49:1775:121362:18:18:89:539:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If we consider some firmf′from groupFb′,b′< b,it can draw away workerw’s offer
49:1776:121440:18:18:71:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from firmfonly if it makes an offer to workerw.  However, firmf′makes an offer to worker
49:1777:121528:18:18:72:539:194:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:w,  conditionally  on  firmfreceiving  a  signal  from  workerw,  only  when  workerwisTf′.
49:1778:121619:18:18:72:539:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, if firmf′responds more to signals, it makes an offer to itsTfmore rarely.  This
49:1779:121707:18:18:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:means that firmf′draws workerwaway from firmfless often.  Therefore, the probability
49:1780:121791:18:33:72:307:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that firmf’s offer is accepted bySfincreases:

49:1782:121899:20:0:81:378:87:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:33One may show by example that this is not, in general, a bijection.
50:1783:121969:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As a corollary ofI)andII), if firmf′increases its cutoff point for some set of signals,
50:1784:122056:18:18:72:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firmfwill also optimally (weakly) increase its cutoff points.  The above logic is valid for the
50:1785:122151:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change of cutoff points for any set of signals of the same size and any profile of preferences,
50:1786:122246:18:30:72:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f25:so the statement of the proposition immediately follows.-
50:1787:122303:30:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Proof of Lemma A1.We prove the first statement first.  Let us consider firmfcutoff

50:1789:122476:18:28:72:164:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preference profiles

50:1791:122531:18:33:190:423:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9: ̄Θ−≡{θ∈Θ|m(σf,σ−f,θ)> m(σ′f,σ−f,θ)}.
50:1792:122568:33:18:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For each profileθfrom set Θ+, it must be the case that without firmf’s offer,Tfhas an

50:1794:122698:33:32:219:540:458:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:m(σ′f,σ−f,θ)−m(σf,σ−f,θ) = 1.(B.1.1)
50:1795:122734:32:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Similarly, if profileθis from set Θ−, it must be the case that without firmfoffer,Sfhas
50:1796:122821:18:33:72:295:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an offer from another firm, andTfdoes not
50:1797:122862:33:33:215:540:375:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:m(σ′f,σ−f,θ)−m(σf,σ−f,θ) =−1.(B.1.2)
50:1798:122898:33:18:89:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We will now show that| ̄Θ+|≥| ̄Θ−|.  Equations (B.1.1) and (B.1.2), along with the fact
50:1799:122985:18:18:72:506:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that eachθ∈Θ+∪Θ−occurs equally likely, will then be enough to prove the result.
50:1800:123064:18:18:89:539:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us denoteTf=w′andSf=w.We construct functionψ: Θ→Θ as follows.  Let
50:1801:123134:18:18:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:ψ(θ)  be  the  profile  in  which  workers  have  preferences  as  inθ,  but  firms−fall  swap  the
50:1802:123233:18:18:72:539:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positions of workersw′andwin their preference lists.  If profileθbelongs to ̄Θ−, without
50:1803:123321:18:17:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firmf’s offer, workerwhas an offer from another firm, and workerw′does not.  Therefore,
50:1804:123408:17:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when preferences areψ(θ), without firmf’s offer the following two statements must be true:
50:1805:123498:18:18:72:499:217:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:i)workerw′musthave another offer andii)workerwcannothave another offer.
50:1806:123569:18:18:89:539:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To seei), note that underθ, workerwsends a signal to firmf, so his outside offer must
50:1807:123654:18:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:come from some firmf′who has ranked him first.  Under profileψ(θ), firmf′ranks worker
50:1808:123739:18:18:72:539:163:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:w′first.  If workerw′has not sent a signal to firmf′, then by anonymity,w′gets the offer of
50:1809:123830:18:18:72:482:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:firmf′.  If workerw′has signaled to firmf′, workerw′again gets firmf′’s offer.
50:1810:123908:18:18:89:539:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To seeii), suppose to the contrary that underψ(θ), workerwdoes in fact receive an offer
50:1811:123995:18:18:72:539:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from some firmf′6=f.  Since workerwsends a signal to firmf, workerwmust beTf′under
50:1812:124077:18:18:72:539:91:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:ψ(θ), so that workerw′isTf′underθ.  But then by anonymityw′receives the offer of firm
50:1813:124162:18:0:72:211:73:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:f′underθ, a contradiction.
51:1814:124190:0:18:89:215:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fromi) andii), we have
51:1815:124212:18:26:249:361:690:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:θ∈ ̄Θ−⇒ψ(θ)∈ ̄Θ+.
51:1816:124229:26:18:71:330:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since functionψis injective, we have| ̄Θ+|≥| ̄Θ−|.
51:1817:124279:18:18:89:539:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In order to prove the second statement note that the expected number of matches of each
51:1818:124366:18:18:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker increases when firmfresponds more to signals.  Using the construction presented
51:1819:124452:18:18:72:539:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:above,  one  can  show  that  whenever  workerw“loses”  a  match  with  firmffor  profileθ
51:1820:124542:18:18:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(workerwisTf) it is possible to construct profileθ′when workerwobtains a match (worker
51:1821:124628:18:18:72:539:574:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:wisSf).  The function that matches these profiles is again injective.  Moreover, workerw
51:1822:124716:18:18:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:values more greatly the match with firmfwhen she has signaled it (Sf) rather when she is
51:1823:124804:18:18:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simply highest ranked (Tf).  Therefore, the ex-ante utility of workerwincreases when firm
51:1824:124893:18:39:72:539:520:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f25:fresponds more to signals.-

51:1838:125284:33:18:71:539:304:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:there is a unique non-babbling equilibrium in the offer game with signals.  Each worker sends
51:1839:125377:18:18:71:540:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:her signal to her top firm.  Each firmfmakes an offer toSfif it receives at least one signal;
51:1840:125470:18:28:71:273:268:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:otherwise, firmfmakes an offer toTf.

51:1843:125650:18:17:89:539:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Proposition 2 shows that if firms−frespond more to signals, i.e.  increase their cutoffs, it
51:1844:125742:17:18:71:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is also optimal for firmfto respond more to signals.  Therefore, if firmfoptimally responds
51:1845:125833:18:18:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to signals when no other firm does, it will certainly optimally respond to signals when other
51:1846:125926:18:18:71:538:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:firm respond.  Hence, it will be enough to consider the incentives of firmfwhen firms−f

57:2226:134610:18:17:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:similar to the one in Sections 3 and 4.  The difference is that each firm now has the capacity
57:2227:134704:17:18:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to hire up toLworkers, and each worker may send up toKidentical costless private signals.
57:2228:134793:18:18:71:539:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  assume  that  the  number  of  signals  each  worker  may  send  is  less  than  the  number  of
57:2229:134893:18:18:71:481:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms,K < F,and each worker can send at most one signal to a particular firm.
57:2230:134970:18:18:89:540:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We assume that firm utilities are additive, i.e.  firmfwith preferencesθfover individual

57:2237:135351:18:18:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  timing  and  strategies  of  agents  of  the  offer  game  without  signals  can  be  adopted
57:2238:135449:18:26:72:150:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from Section 3:
57:2239:135464:26:17:86:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.  Agents’ preferences are realized.  In the case of a signaling mechanism,  each  worker
57:2240:135554:17:18:101:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sends up toKprivate, identical, costless signals to firms.  Signals are sent simultane-
57:2241:135641:18:28:101:421:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ously, and are observed only by firms who have received them.
57:2242:135702:28:27:86:507:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.  Each firm makes an offer to at mostLworkers; offers are made simultaneously.
57:2243:135782:27:25:86:473:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.  Each worker accepts at most one offer from the set of offers she receives.
57:2244:135860:25:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Once again, sequential rationality ensures that workers will always select the best available
57:2245:135953:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer.   Hence,  we  take  this  behavior  for  workers  as  given  and  focus  on  the  reduced  game
57:2246:136055:18:18:72:240:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consisting of the first two stages.
57:2247:136090:18:18:89:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A mixed strategy for workerwwhen deciding wether and to whom to send signals is a
57:2248:136171:18:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:map from the set of all possible preference lists to the set of distributions over subsets of
57:2249:136264:18:18:72:539:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms of sizeKor less that we denote as ∆(2FK), i.e.σw: Θw→∆(2FK).  Similarly, a mixed
57:2250:136350:18:18:72:539:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategy of firmfis a map from the set of all possible preference lists, Θf, and the set of
57:2251:136441:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all possible combinations of received signals, 2W,to the set of distributions over subsets of
57:2252:136534:18:18:72:522:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers of sizeLor less, which we denote as ∆(2WL).  That is,σf: Θf×2W→∆(2WL).
57:2253:136612:18:18:89:539:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Preferences of both firms and workers are independently and uniformly chosen from all
57:2254:136697:18:18:72:539:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:possible preference orderings.  Similarly to Sections 3 and 4 we defineσW, σF, Σw,Σf,πw, and
57:2255:136789:18:18:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:πf.  The definition of sequential equilibrium and anonymous strategies can also be adopted
57:2256:136879:18:0:72:198:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in an analagous manner.
58:2257:136904:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We first consider an offer game without signals.  If firms use anonymous strategies, the
58:2258:136992:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:chances of hiring any worker, conditional on making her an offer, are the same.  Therefore,
58:2259:137083:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each firm optimally makes its offers to theLhighest-ranked workers on its preference list.
58:2260:137173:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This is the unique symmetric equilibrium of the offer game without signals when firms use
58:2261:137262:18:18:72:294:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:anonymous strategies (see Proposition B3).
58:2262:137304:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now turn to the analysis of the offer game with signals.  In any symmetric equilibrium
58:2263:137393:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in which workers send signals and signals are interpreted as a sign of interest by firms and
58:2264:137485:18:18:72:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:hence increase the chance of receiving an offer,  each worker sends herKsignals to herK
58:2265:137572:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:most preferred firms (see Proposition B4).  As in the case of one signal and each firm only
58:2266:137663:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:having one position, we pin down the behavior of workers in equilibrium:  workers send their
58:2267:137755:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals to their highest ranked firms, and workers accept the best available offer.  We now
58:2268:137846:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examine offers of firms in the second stage of the game, taking the strategies of workers and
58:2269:137939:18:18:72:338:492:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:beliefs of firms about interpreting signals as given.35
58:2270:137994:18:17:89:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Section 4 each worker could send up to one signal, and each firm hadL= 1 positions
58:2271:138079:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to fill.  Then, when all other firms used anonymous strategies, firmfdecided between making
58:2272:138170:18:18:72:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an offer tof’s most preferred workerTf(orT1f) andf’s most preferred worker in the subset of
58:2273:138261:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaled workersSf(orS1f).  Now, when all other firms use anonymous strategies, firmfcan
58:2274:138349:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make up toLoffers.  When deciding whom to make the first offer, firmf, once more, decides
58:2275:138438:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between the most preferred workerTf(orT1f) and the most prefered worker among those
58:2276:138521:18:18:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who sent a signalSf(orS1f) where that decision may depend on the total number of signals
58:2277:138609:18:18:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:received.  So, if firmfreceived|WS|signals and uses a cutoff strategy with corresponding
58:2278:138697:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cutoffj|WS|, thenfmakes an offer toS1fif and only if the rank ofS1fis lower or equal than
58:2279:138786:18:18:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:j|WS|.  If firmfmade an offer toS1f, then, for the second position, the firm decides between
58:2280:138878:18:18:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:T1fandS2fthe most preferred worker among those that sent a signal to whom firmfhas not
58:2281:138964:18:18:72:538:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:made an offer yet.  Furthermore, firmfwill use thesamecutoff strategy as before:  Firmf
58:2282:139051:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:still received|WS|signals and hence will make an offer toS2fcompared toT1fif and only if
58:2283:139139:18:17:72:246:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the rank ofS1fis lower thanj|WS|.
58:2284:139172:17:18:89:537:224:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f13:If the firm made its first offer toT1f, then for the second offer, firmfdecides betweenT2f
58:2285:139262:18:18:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:andS1f, wherefcan use a new cutoff strategy, since the alternative to a signaling worker
58:2286:139350:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  nowT2f,  the  overall  second  most  preferred  worker,  and  notT2f.   We  can  show  that  in
58:2287:139449:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium, the cutoff forT2fwill be greater than forT1ffor any number if received signals
58:2288:139540:18:29:72:519:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(see Proposition B5).  We can now define the notion of cutoff strategies for this setting.
58:2289:139630:29:15:81:539:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:35Note that in any non-babbling symmetric equilibrium, all information sets for firms are realized with
58:2290:139733:15:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:positive probability.  Hence, the beliefs of firms are determined by Bayes’ Law:  if a firm receives a signal
58:2291:139842:12:12:72:539:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:from a worker, it believes that it is on of thekth top firms,k∈{1,...,K},in the workers’ preference list and
58:2292:139950:12:0:72:366:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the probability of having rankkis identical across ranks{1,...,K}.

59:2296:140277:18:18:72:538:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:For any numbermof offers already made,  let the most preferred worker to whom firmf

59:2299:140523:18:19:72:332:600:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:m=q+r−2.Then firmfmakes its next offer to

59:2302:140589:18:43:244:322:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Trfotherwise.
59:2303:140602:43:18:89:539:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We call (J1,...,JL)a cutoff matrixthat has cutoff vectors for each of the topLranked
59:2304:140686:18:18:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers  as  its  components.   Note  that  the  probability  of  a  firm’s  offer  being  accepted  by
59:2305:140789:18:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:any worker who has signaled to it is the same as in a symmetric equilibrium.  Similarly, the
59:2306:140881:18:18:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability of a firm’s offer being accepted by any worker who has not signaled to the firm
59:2307:140972:18:18:72:348:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is also the same across such workers (see Lemma B2).
59:2308:141024:18:18:89:539:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using  an  argument  similar  to  the  case  of  one  position  and  one  signal,  we  show  that
59:2309:141121:18:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cutoff strategies are optimal strategies for firms (see Proposition B6).  We can also impose
59:2310:141213:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a partial order on the cutoff strategies as in Section 4.  However, strategies of firms are no
59:2311:141307:18:17:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:longer necessarily strategic complements.  When other firms respond more to signals,  this
59:2312:141397:17:18:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decreases the payoff from making an offer to both workers who have and workers who have
59:2313:141484:18:18:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not signaled to the firm.  This is because receiving a signal does not guarantee acceptance in
59:2314:141578:18:18:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:case an offer is tendered to that worker.  We can, however, assure the existence of symmetric
59:2315:141671:18:28:72:214:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mixed strategy equilibrium.
59:2316:141698:28:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:Theorem B1(Equilibrium Existence).There  exists  a  symmetric  equilibrium  of  the  offer

59:2318:141887:18:28:72:212:229:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:symmetric cutoff strategies.
59:2319:141915:28:18:89:539:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now address the welfare implications from the introduction of a signaling mechanism.
59:2320:142002:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Proposition B2 and Theorem B2 formally restate our welfare results from previous chapters
59:2321:142091:18:18:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the case when firms have many positions and workers can send multiple signals.  The
59:2322:142178:18:18:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:logic of their proofs again begins with an incremental approach:  we first study the effect of
59:2323:142272:18:18:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a single firm increasing its cutoff, that is, responding more to signals.  We then rank various
59:2324:142367:18:17:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaling equilibria in terms of their outcomes.  Finally, we show how the introduction of a
59:2325:142459:17:0:72:378:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signaling mechanism impacts our three measures of welfare.

60:2334:143109:28:18:88:540:514:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:i.  The  expected  number  of  matches  is  strictly  greater  than  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of

60:2349:144086:28:18:71:539:133:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:Proof.Select an arbitrary worker.  Firms use symmetric anonymous strategies, signals are
60:2350:144174:18:18:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:identical,  and  the  worker  can  send  at  most  one  signal  to  a  given  firm.   Hence,  from  the
60:2351:144277:18:18:71:539:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worker’s perspective the probability of getting an offer from a firm depends only on whether
60:2352:144369:18:0:71:539:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the worker has sent a signal  to this firm or not.  Similar to the  argument of  the proof of

61:2354:144562:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater than the probability of getting an offer from a firm that does not receive the worker’s
61:2355:144657:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signal.  Since this probability does not depend on the identity of the firm in a symmetric
61:2356:144747:18:40:72:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f25:equilibrium we conclude that the worker optimally sends her signals to herKtop firms.-

66:2543:156333:18:18:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cutoffs we first consider the following situation.  We take some firmfsuch that its strategy
66:2544:156425:18:18:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:σfdiffers  fromσ′fonly  in  thatσ′fhas  weakly  greater  cutoffs.   Let  us  consider  some  firm
66:2545:156522:18:18:72:539:275:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:f′∈−f.  For each profile of preferencesθf′and a set of signalsWS, firmf′either makes an
66:2546:156609:18:18:72:539:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:offer toSf′(θf′,WS) orTf′(θf′,WS).  If firmfresponds more to signals this decreases the
66:2547:156696:18:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability that bothTf′andSf′accept firmf′offer.  Therefore, the expected payoff of firm
66:2548:156785:18:32:72:401:221:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:f′∈−fweakly decreases when firmfresponds more to signals.
66:2549:156842:32:33:203:408:189:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Eθ(πf′(σf,σ−f,θ))≥Eθ(πf′(σ′f,σ−f,θ)).
66:2550:156879:33:18:89:539:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:Let us now consider two symmetric equilibria where firms play cutoff strategies  ̃σand  ̄σ
66:2551:156969:18:33:72:530:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correspondingly such that  ̃σ≥ ̄σ.  From the definition of an equilibrium strategy we have:
66:2552:157060:33:33:209:402:105:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:Eθ[πf( ̄σf, ̄σ−f,θ)]≥Eθ[πf(  ̃σf, ̄σ−f,θ)]
66:2553:157102:33:0:71:311:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using the result proved above we proceed with
67:2554:157149:0:26:209:402:690:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:Eθ[πf(  ̃σf, ̄σ−f,θ)]≥Eθ[πf(  ̃σf, ̃σ−f,θ)]
67:2555:157192:26:36:72:121:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Therefore

67:2558:157243:30:18:72:201:572:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Proof of Theorem B2.
67:2559:157263:18:18:89:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Denote  firm  strategies  in  the  unique  equilibrium  of  the  offer  game  with  no  signals  as
67:2560:157362:18:18:72:539:536:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:σ0F.  Now consider a symmetric equilibrium of the offer game with signals where agents use
67:2561:157452:18:18:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategies (σF,σW).  If agents employ strategies (σ0F,σW), the expected number of matches
67:2562:157541:18:18:71:539:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the welfare of workers equal the corresponding parameters in the offer game with no
67:2563:157628:18:18:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:signals.  Therefore, the result that the expected number of matches and the expected welfare
67:2564:157720:18:18:71:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of workers in a symmetric equilibrium in the offer game with signals areweaklygreater than
67:2565:157810:18:17:71:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the corresponding parameters in the unique equilibrium of the offer game with no signals is a
67:2566:157903:17:18:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consequence of sequential application of Lemma B3.  The result for worker and firm welfare,
67:2567:157994:18:0:71:539:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f25:and the argument that the comparison is strict are analagous to those in Theorem 4.-
