2:14:362:20:14:156:470:417:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:This paper provides a simple theory to study how the allocation of
2:15:428:14:13:140:470:403:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:public funds between primary and higher education affects human cap-
2:16:496:13:14:140:470:390:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:ital accumulation. The allocation is endogenously determined through
2:17:564:14:13:140:470:376:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:majority voting. Public funding for higher education is not supported
2:18:633:13:14:140:470:363:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:when a majority is poor. In some cases, higher education starts to be
2:19:702:14:14:140:470:349:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:realized as a majority of individuals accumulate enough human capital
2:20:771:14:13:140:470:335:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:through primary education. Although the emergence of higher educa-
2:21:837:13:14:140:470:322:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:tion can accelerate aggregate human capital accumulation, it widens
2:22:904:14:13:140:470:308:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:income inequality because the very poor are excluded from higher ed-
2:23:972:13:14:140:470:295:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:F:ucation and the declined budget share for primary education decreases

3:33:1461:27:14:110:499:627:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Human capital accumulation can be an engine of economic growth, and the
3:34:1532:14:14:110:499:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government has significant roles in providing formal education. In many ex-
3:35:1607:14:15:110:499:599:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:isting studies, human capital is produced in a single education sector, where
3:36:1684:15:14:110:499:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an amount of government expenditure is a direct input. In reality, however,
3:37:1759:14:15:110:499:570:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an education system is divided into multiple stages, such as primary, sec-
3:38:1833:15:14:110:499:555:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ondary and tertiary education, and the government supports each of them.
3:39:1905:14:15:110:499:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Primary and secondary (K-12) education has a particularly big difference
3:40:1977:15:14:110:499:526:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from tertiary education in the sense that it is mandatory but serves everyone
3:41:2054:14:15:110:499:512:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for free although college education is optional and requires private spending.
3:42:2132:15:14:128:499:497:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:It is relatively recently, however, that a number of studies have begun to
3:43:2206:14:14:110:499:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:analyze how the allocation of government expenditures for different educa-
3:44:2280:14:15:110:499:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion sectors affects economic growth and income distribution (Restuccia and
3:45:2355:15:14:110:499:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Urrutia, 2004; Su, 2004; Blankenau, 2005; Blankenau et al., 2007; Arcalean

3:48:2578:14:15:110:499:411:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sectors may increase the welfare of some individuals at the expense of others
3:49:2655:15:14:110:499:396:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as shown by Su (2004) and Blankenau et al. (2007), which provides fertile
3:50:2728:14:15:110:499:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ground for politico-economic analysis. For example, enhancing college edu-
3:51:2802:15:14:110:499:367:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cation may most benefit the rich but may not benefit the poor who cannot
3:52:2874:14:14:110:499:353:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:afford to attend there or those whose private return from college is low due
3:53:2950:14:15:110:244:339:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to their low innate ability.
3:54:2978:15:14:128:499:324:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:This paper proposes an overlapping generations model in which the allo-
3:55:3049:14:15:110:499:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cation of a given level of public education expenditures for multiple education
3:56:3128:15:14:110:499:295:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sectors is determined via majority voting and analyzes its effects on human
3:57:3203:14:15:110:499:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital accumulation. Individuals live for two periods, childhood and adult-
3:58:3279:15:14:110:499:266:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hood, and they have children when they are adult. Individuals in adulthood
3:59:3353:14:15:110:499:252:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:make all the economic and political decisions but they care about human
3:60:3424:15:14:110:499:237:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital of their children. The government operates two education sectors,
3:61:3497:14:14:110:499:223:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which we call primary and higher education sectors. Primary education is
3:62:3569:14:15:110:499:209:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:compulsory but serves all childhood individuals free of charge. On the other
3:63:3645:15:14:110:499:194:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hand, higher education is optional and requires private expenditures. In each
3:64:3722:14:15:110:499:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:education, private return on education depends on resource allocations from
3:65:3797:15:14:110:499:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the government and parental human capital. Parents with low human capital
3:66:3870:14:15:110:499:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are unable to or unwilling to have their children receive higher education be-
3:67:3948:15:14:110:499:136:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cause its private return is low or they are too poor to cover its private costs.
3:68:4028:14:0:110:499:122:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Parents whose human capital is above some threshold are willing and able
4:69:4101:0:15:110:499:654:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to have their children obtain higher education. We show that the individual
4:70:4176:15:14:110:499:639:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with median human capital is the decisive voter although preferences for the
4:71:4252:14:15:110:368:625:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:allocation policy are not necessarily single-peaked.
4:72:4304:15:14:128:499:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Our model generates various dynamics of human capital accumulation
4:73:4370:14:14:110:499:596:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and steady state income inequalities. As long as human capital of the median
4:74:4446:14:15:110:499:582:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:voter is below some threshold, all the resources are provided for primary edu-
4:75:4524:15:14:110:499:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cation. In some cases, the median voter accumulates sufficient human capital
4:76:4600:14:15:110:499:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:through primary education and a positive share of government expenditure
4:77:4672:15:14:110:499:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is allocated to higher education. Although the emergence of higher educa-
4:78:4745:14:15:110:499:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion can facilitate aggregate human capital accumulation, it widens steady
4:79:4819:15:14:110:499:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:state income inequality because the very poor are excluded from higher ed-
4:80:4893:14:15:110:499:495:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ucation and declined share for primary education diminishes its quality. In
4:81:4968:15:14:110:499:480:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:other cases, public support for higher education is never realized if the initial
4:82:5049:14:14:110:350:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human capital level of the median voter is low.
4:83:5096:14:15:128:499:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The relationship between the political economy of education policies and
4:84:5168:15:14:110:499:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic growth has been studied at least since Glomm and Ravikumar
4:85:5235:14:15:110:499:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(1992) and Saint-Paul and Verdier (1993). A more recent example includes
4:86:5307:15:14:110:499:408:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Galor et al.  (2009), who examine an incentive of agents who are better
4:87:5378:14:15:110:499:394:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:endowed with production factors to prevent the implementation of public
4:88:5449:15:14:110:499:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:education. They argue that landowners wish to block policy changes that
4:89:5520:14:15:110:499:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:promote human capital formation and unequal distribution of landownership
4:90:5593:15:14:110:275:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has an adverse effect on growth.
4:91:5625:14:15:128:499:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up a model,
4:92:5699:15:14:110:499:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Section 3 analyzes individuals’ decisions of investment in higher educa-
4:93:5775:14:14:110:499:307:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion. Section 4 studies how the share of government budget for primary and
4:94:5849:14:15:110:499:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:higher education is determined under majority voting. Section 5 examines
4:95:5921:15:14:110:499:278:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interactions between the education policy and human capital accumulation.
4:96:5994:14:40:110:213:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Section 6 concludes.

4:98:6026:27:14:110:499:197:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:We study an overlapping generations model. Each generation consists of a
4:99:6098:14:14:110:499:183:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unit mass of individuals who live for two periods, childhood and adulthood.
4:100:6173:14:15:110:499:169:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Every individual, who belongs to a lineage indexed byi, has one child in
4:101:6245:15:14:110:499:154:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the second period. The only source of heterogeneity across individuals is the
4:102:6322:14:0:110:499:140:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human capital of their parents. Individualiborn in periodtderives utility

5:107:6580:15:14:128:499:572:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In the childhood, individuals make no decisions but receive compulsory
5:108:6650:14:15:110:499:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:primary education supplied by the government. After the completion of the
5:109:6723:15:14:110:499:543:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:primary education, their parents may decide to have them receive further
5:110:6795:14:15:110:499:529:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:education, or higher education, which is also supplied by the government.
5:111:6868:15:14:110:499:514:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Higher education requires a private cost, whose size is fixed and normalized
5:112:6944:14:15:110:499:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to one. Parents cannot borrow against future human capital of their children
5:113:7020:15:14:110:499:485:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and therefore must self-finance the cost. In the adulthood, individuals make
5:114:7096:14:15:110:499:471:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:all the economic and political decisions. They supply their human capital
5:115:7169:15:14:110:499:456:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to a firm that transforms one unit of human capital to one unit of a final
5:116:7243:14:14:110:499:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:good. The final good market is perfectly competitive and therefore the wage
5:117:7318:14:15:110:499:428:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:per unit of human capital is one. Individuals also vote for an allocation of

11:356:15875:14:15:110:499:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:some individuals obtain both primary and higher education while the others
11:357:15949:15:14:110:499:437:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:obtain only primary education, and moreover, the quality of primary educa-
11:358:16023:14:15:110:499:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion is diminished since a positive share of the government budget is used to
11:359:16100:15:14:110:499:408:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finance higher education. This creates high income inequality. Notice that if
11:360:16177:14:15:110:416:394:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f7:B:hm0- ̃H, thenˆt= 0 and the above analysis remains intact.
11:361:16234:15:14:128:499:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Second, we need to discuss the case whereh∗1< ̃H-h∗3. In this case,
11:362:16301:14:15:110:498:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the realization of higher education is dependent on the value ofhm0. Figure
11:363:16376:15:14:110:499:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:5 (a) depicts the dynamics ofhmt. Ifhm0< ̃H,hmtconverges toh∗1< ̃H.
11:364:16443:14:15:110:499:336:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Higher education is hence never realized, and human capital of all lineages
11:365:16518:15:14:110:499:321:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:converges toh∗1. There is no income inequality in the long-run. Ifhm0- ̃H,
11:366:16592:14:14:110:499:307:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f14:B:on the other hand, higher education is realized at the beginning, andhmt
11:367:16664:14:15:110:499:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:converges toh∗3. Dynamic analysis on the other lineages is essentially the
11:368:16738:15:14:110:499:278:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f13:B:same as that in the case where ̃H-h∗1andhm0- ̃H(ˆt= 0). For lineagei
11:369:16806:14:15:110:499:264:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such thathi0-H(x∗), all individuals obtain higher education all the time
11:370:16878:15:14:110:498:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:andhitconverges toh3. For lineageisuch thathi0-H(x∗), the dynamic
11:371:16943:14:15:110:498:235:12:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f14:B:behavior ofhitdepends on the value ofh∗2andH(x∗). Ifh∗2-H(x∗),hit
11:372:17008:15:14:110:499:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:follows the path illustrated in Figure 4 (c). Every individual in the economy
11:373:17085:14:15:110:499:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:obtainh∗3in the steady state and there is income inequality in the long-run.
11:374:17161:15:14:110:499:191:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Ifh∗2< H(x∗), all individuals in a lineage withhi0< H(x∗) receive only

11:376:17300:14:15:110:360:163:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:generates substantial long-run income inequality.
11:377:17349:15:14:128:499:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Finally, in the case whereh∗3< ̃H, higher education is not realized in
11:378:17419:14:15:110:499:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the long-run. Ifhm0- ̃H, then higher education obtains majority support

12:413:18024:27:14:110:499:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The government plays an important role of funding both primary and higher
12:414:18097:14:15:110:499:187:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:education. This paper provides a theoretical examination on how the alloca-
12:415:18172:15:14:110:499:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:tion of public expenditures across the each education influences the dynamics

12:418:18395:14:0:110:499:129:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:optional and requires private expenditures. When a majority of individuals

13:433:18690:15:14:110:499:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ucation is not realized. In some cases, however, the individuals accumulate
13:434:18765:14:14:110:499:409:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human capital sufficiently, and higher education begins to obtain majority
13:435:18839:14:15:110:499:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:support. This enables a majority of individuals to accelerate their human
13:436:18912:15:14:110:499:380:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital accumulation although it decreases the budget share for primary ed-
13:437:18987:14:15:110:499:366:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ucation and declines its quality. As an economy grows, income inequality
13:438:19059:15:14:110:499:351:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can expand between individuals who obtain higher education and those who
13:439:19131:14:15:110:146:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:do not.
13:440:19138:15:14:128:499:322:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:We have assumed that individuals must cover private costs to obtain
13:441:19205:14:15:110:499:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:higher education supplied by the government. The logic of our model would
13:442:19278:15:14:110:499:293:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:be applied to other public policies by considering a situation in which access
13:443:19356:14:14:110:499:279:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to publicly provided services requires private spending.  For example, the
13:444:19430:14:15:110:499:265:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government may consider two policies: (i) public support to enhance pro-
13:445:19502:15:14:110:499:250:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ductivity in high-tech industries that employ skilled workers, and (ii) lump-
13:446:19579:14:15:110:499:236:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sum transfer of a tax revenue to all individuals. Rich individuals who can
13:447:19653:15:14:110:499:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:cover education costs to be a skilled worker would prefer public support for
13:448:19729:14:15:110:499:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:high-tech industries while poor individuals would prefer lump-sum transfer.
13:449:19804:15:14:110:499:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The implication of such a situation for economic growth would be a topic of
