2:35:2036:28:14:72:539:588:12:Times:12:Times:Do the short and medium term adjustment costs associated with trade liberalization influence schooling
2:36:2138:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:and child labor decisions? We examine this question in the context of India's 1991 tariff reforms. Overall,
2:37:2245:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:in the 1990s, rural India experienced a dramatic increase in schooling and decline in child labor. However,
2:38:2352:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:communities that relied heavily on employment in protected industries before liberalization do not
2:39:2450:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:experience as large an increase in schooling or decline in child labor. The data suggest that this failure
2:40:2556:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:to follow the national trend of increasing schooling and diminishing work is associated with a failure
2:41:2658:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:to follow the national trend in poverty reduction. Schooling costs appear to play a large role in this
2:42:2760:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:relationship between poverty, schooling, and child labor. Extrapolating from our results, our estimates
2:43:2863:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:imply that roughly half of India's rise in schooling and a third of the fall in child labor during the 1990s
2:44:2971:14:28:72:498:462:12:Times:12:Times:can be explained by falling poverty and therefore improved capacity to afford schooling.

3:65:3439:0:24:64:151:715:170:Times:170:Times:1. Introduction 
3:66:3455:24:23:64:500:691:133:Times:133:Times:Trade liberalization is one of the most common policy prescriptions offered to initiate poverty 
3:67:3551:23:22:64:514:668:133:Times:133:Times:eradication in today’s developing countries. Standard trade theory is clear on the many long-term 
3:68:3649:22:23:64:524:646:133:Times:133:Times:benefits of trade liberalization working through lower prices on consumption goods and production 
3:69:3747:23:22:64:511:623:133:Times:133:Times:inputs, greater competition, and opportunities for specialization. Most of the concern about trade 
3:70:3846:22:23:64:534:601:133:Times:133:Times:liberalization focuses on the impact of the loss of protection on those currently employed in protected 
3:71:3950:23:22:64:548:578:133:Times:133:Times:industries. Several empirical studies document the adjustment costs born by these workers subsequent to 
3:72:4054:22:23:64:507:556:133:Times:133:Times:trade reforms in many developing countries (see, for example, Harrison and Hanson (1999) and 
3:73:4147:23:22:64:512:533:133:Times:133:Times:Revenga (1997) for Mexico, Currie and Harrison (1997) for Morocco, Attanasio et al (2004) and 
3:74:4241:22:23:64:403:511:133:Times:133:Times:Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005) for Colombia, Topalova (2005) for India).  
3:75:4312:23:22:100:524:488:133:Times:133:Times:Our study considers whether these short and medium-term adjustment costs of trade reform 
3:76:4401:22:23:64:526:466:133:Times:133:Times:influence the schooling and work decisions of children. There are several possible channels through 
3:77:4501:23:22:64:547:443:133:Times:133:Times:which the labor market impacts of trade liberalization could affect households’ investment in the human 
3:78:4605:22:23:64:504:421:133:Times:133:Times:capital of their children. First, most of the above studies document a correlation between living 
3:79:4703:23:22:64:511:398:133:Times:133:Times:standards and the loss of workers’ protection from trade liberalization (see Harrison (2006) for a 
3:80:4802:22:23:64:546:376:133:Times:133:Times:review). While the empirical relationship between living standards and child labor or schooling is not as 
3:81:4908:23:22:64:530:353:133:Times:133:Times:robust as theory often assumes (Basu 1999), living standards seem one obvious channel. Second, the 
3:82:5007:22:22:64:504:331:133:Times:133:Times:child’s economic contribution to the household may be affected by the loss of protection or the 
3:83:5103:22:23:64:535:309:133:Times:133:Times:structural shifts associated with it. A number of studies pioneered by Schultz (1960), Rosenzweig and 
3:84:5205:23:22:64:532:286:133:Times:133:Times:Evenson (1977) and Rosenzweig (1982) have established a connection between the demand for child 
3:85:5301:22:23:64:530:264:133:Times:133:Times:labor and schooling and children’s participation in the work force. Third, the structural change in the 
3:86:5405:23:22:64:539:241:133:Times:133:Times:economy as a result of trade liberalization may affect returns to education, which in turn will influence 
3:87:5511:22:23:64:543:219:133:Times:133:Times:educational attainment (Becker 1965, Foster and Rosenzweig 1996). The more diffuse benefits of trade-
3:88:5612:23:22:64:535:196:133:Times:133:Times:induced changes in consumer prices, market structure, productivity, incentives for innovation, etc. are 
3:89:5716:22:23:64:546:174:133:Times:133:Times:unlikely to be captured through a focus on employment loss of protection.1 However, understanding the 
3:90:5818:23:26:64:523:151:133:Times:133:Times:implications for children of the adjustment costs associated with trade reform’s impact on the labor 
3:91:5919:26:8:208:211:125:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
3:92:5967:8:16:64:540:117:42:Times:100:Times:1 Several studies assess the aggregate relationship between trade and child labor or schooling (Shelburne 2001, Cigno, 
3:93:6086:16:11:64:529:101:100:Times:100:Times:Rosati, and Guarcello 2002, Edmonds and Pavcnik 2006), while Edmonds and Pavcnik (2005) examine variation in 
3:94:6195:11:12:64:534:90:100:Times:100:Times:child labor with changes in relative prices during an export expansion. The present study is distinct in its focus on an 
3:95:6316:12:11:64:544:78:100:Times:100:Times:actual trade policy change, its focus on adjustment costs, and the degree to which it identifies the channels that underlie 
3:96:6440:11:0:64:285:67:100:Times:100:Times:the trade reform – schooling – child labor relationship. 
4:97:6498:0:22:64:532:716:133:Times:133:Times:market is important given the theoretical possibility of poverty traps generated by a lack of education 
4:98:6602:22:23:64:537:694:133:Times:133:Times:(Barham et al 1995), child labor (Basu and Van 1998), or occupational choice (Banerjee and Newman 
4:99:6700:23:22:64:532:671:133:Times:133:Times:1993). Moreover, a better understanding of the channels influencing schooling in the context of trade 
4:100:6802:22:23:64:520:649:133:Times:133:Times:adjustment may shed light on how human capital accumulates as countries grow and what policies 
4:101:6897:23:22:64:217:626:133:Times:133:Times:might best expedite this process. 
4:102:6931:22:23:100:508:604:133:Times:133:Times:We examine these issues in the context of India’s 1991 trade reform. In August 1991, in 
4:103:7019:23:22:64:506:581:133:Times:133:Times:response to a severe balance of payment crisis, India agreed to an IMF adjustment program that 
4:104:7114:22:23:64:530:559:133:Times:133:Times:stipulated a substantial liberalization of trade policy. Import tariffs across all sectors were drastically 
4:105:7222:23:22:64:545:536:133:Times:133:Times:reduced and brought to a more uniform level. Set largely by the 1991 agreement, tariff changes over the 
4:106:7326:22:23:64:531:514:133:Times:133:Times:1992-1997 were not the result of the usual political economy process and were unlikely to have been 
4:107:7426:23:22:64:494:491:133:Times:133:Times:anticipated by labor as tariffs had not changed substantively since the mid 1950s. We exploit 
4:108:7520:22:23:64:513:469:133:Times:133:Times:heterogeneity in the pre-reform industrial composition of employment across Indian districts and 
4:109:7617:23:22:64:532:446:133:Times:133:Times:differences across industries in the magnitude of tariff declines over time to study the impact of tariff 
4:110:7723:22:23:64:540:424:133:Times:133:Times:reductions on child time allocation.  Each of India's states and territories is subdivided into districts for 
4:111:7833:23:22:64:545:401:133:Times:133:Times:administrative purposes. Microeconomic studies of rural India from Rosenzweig and Evenson (1977) to 
4:112:7933:22:23:64:543:379:133:Times:133:Times:Duflo and Pande (2007) focus on the district as the relevant labor market unit because of very low rates 
4:113:8038:23:22:64:541:356:133:Times:133:Times:of permanent mobility between districts. By focusing on differences across districts in changes in tariff 
4:114:8144:22:23:64:545:334:133:Times:133:Times:protection, we cannot evaluate the impact of tariffs on economy wide schooling and child labor. Rather, 
4:115:8248:23:22:64:511:311:133:Times:133:Times:we consider how schooling and child labor changes differ in districts with large changes in tariff 
4:116:8347:22:23:64:452:289:133:Times:133:Times:protection on employment relative to districts with little change in tariff protection.  
4:117:8436:23:22:100:517:266:133:Times:133:Times:We observe smaller increases in school attendance among children in rural districts where 
4:118:8526:22:22:64:525:244:133:Times:133:Times:employment was concentrated in industries exposed to large changes in output tariffs. Literacy also 
4:119:8626:22:23:64:535:222:133:Times:133:Times:appears diminished relative to the national trend. The findings are robust to a variety of approaches to 
4:120:8731:23:22:64:529:199:133:Times:133:Times:deal with the potential endogeneity of the baseline composition of employment and the confounding 
4:121:8829:22:23:64:532:177:133:Times:133:Times:effects of concurrent reforms in other parts of the economy.  We find no relationship between reform-
4:122:8930:23:22:64:529:154:133:Times:133:Times:induced tariff declines and changes in school attendance for children in pre-reform data. In addition, 
4:123:9033:22:23:64:543:132:133:Times:133:Times:there is no relationship between tariff declines and changes in literacy in older cohorts whose education 
4:124:9139:23:22:64:546:109:133:Times:133:Times:should have been completed before the onset of trade liberalization. These robustness checks provide an 
4:125:9243:22:0:64:285:87:133:Times:133:Times:important validation of our empirical approach. 
5:126:9292:0:22:100:521:716:133:Times:133:Times:A strong poverty-schooling relationship is the most likely explanation for our findings.  As 
5:127:9385:22:23:64:513:694:133:Times:133:Times:documented in Topalova (2005), higher exposure to trade liberalization is associated with slower 
5:128:9482:23:22:64:542:671:133:Times:133:Times:poverty reduction relative to the national trend in rural India. Narrative evidence from rural India in the 
5:129:9590:22:23:64:510:649:133:Times:133:Times:Public Report On Basic Education in India (1999) emphasizes schooling costs as a major reason 
5:130:9684:23:22:64:548:626:133:Times:133:Times:children either never attend or drop out of school, and our data are most consistent with the avoidance of 
5:131:9791:22:23:64:527:604:133:Times:133:Times:schooling related costs as the explanation for the poverty-schooling relationship in this study. While 
5:132:9894:23:22:64:545:581:133:Times:133:Times:children work more in districts with larger tariff declines, the additional work is largely in activities that 
5:133:10005:22:23:64:529:559:133:Times:133:Times:will not bring direct wage income (i.e. domestic work) and the changes in schooling are much larger 
5:134:10105:23:22:64:521:536:133:Times:133:Times:than the (relative) increase in work. In fact, there is a significant rise in children who report neither 
5:135:10211:22:23:64:545:514:133:Times:133:Times:attending school nor working. We also observe reduced schooling expenditures and increased reports of 
5:136:10313:23:22:64:526:491:133:Times:133:Times:families taking loans for education. Moreover, we find some suggestive evidence that the impact on 
5:137:10412:22:23:64:520:469:133:Times:133:Times:school attendance of declines in tariff protection on employment is more pronounced in areas with 
5:138:10510:23:22:64:531:446:133:Times:133:Times:higher schooling costs.  We observe little evidence of a strong link between employment exposure to

5:140:10673:23:22:100:523:401:133:Times:133:Times:This emphasis on schooling costs to explain a poverty-schooling connection is important in 
5:141:10764:22:23:64:538:379:133:Times:133:Times:understanding human capital investment. The empirical evidence on the poverty-child labor-schooling 
5:142:10864:23:22:64:510:356:133:Times:133:Times:link is fraught with econometric challenges. Even studies that find a robust statistical link do not 
5:143:10965:22:23:64:513:334:133:Times:133:Times:pinpoint the reason for this relationship (Behrman and Knowles 2001, Glewwe and Jacoby 2004, 
5:144:11058:23:22:64:548:311:133:Times:133:Times:Edmonds 2005, Yang 2006). Theory often attributes a connection to parental preferences (Basu and Van 
5:145:11159:22:23:64:529:289:133:Times:133:Times:1998) and the marginal utility associated with the child’s direct economic contribution (for example, 
5:146:11261:23:22:64:532:266:133:Times:133:Times:Baland and Robinson 2000). However, our emphasis on schooling costs is consistent with Thomas et 
5:147:11358:22:22:64:545:244:133:Times:133:Times:al’s (2004) observation that the largest changes in schooling in Indonesia during its financial crisis were 
5:148:11466:22:23:64:526:222:133:Times:133:Times:among younger children with the least chance of making a direct economic contribution. Moreover, 
5:149:11563:23:22:64:511:199:133:Times:133:Times:recent experimental evidence from Angrist et al (2002) and Duflo et al (2006) shows substantive 
5:150:11659:22:23:64:545:177:133:Times:133:Times:changes in schooling resulting from interventions designed to lower schooling costs. These experiments 
5:151:11762:23:22:64:528:154:133:Times:133:Times:cannot examine the relative importance of schooling costs in explaining the link between changes in 
5:152:11862:22:23:64:515:132:133:Times:133:Times:living standards and schooling, and our results suggest that schooling cost play an important role. 
5:153:11962:23:22:100:540:109:133:Times:133:Times:The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide a conceptual framework. In Section 3, 
5:154:12056:22:0:64:518:87:133:Times:133:Times:we describe the data and Indian trade reform. In Section 4, we outline the empirical methodology. 
6:155:12155:0:22:64:509:716:133:Times:133:Times:Section 5 discusses the empirical estimates of the relationship between schooling and tariffs and 
6:156:12253:22:23:64:502:694:133:Times:133:Times:establishes the robustness of results. Section 6 explores the underlying mechanisms behind the 
6:157:12348:23:24:64:396:671:133:Times:133:Times:relationship between schooling and tariff changes. Section 7 concludes. 
6:158:12420:24:24:64:213:647:170:Times:170:Times:2. Conceptual Framework 
6:159:12444:24:22:64:531:623:133:Times:133:Times:The benefits of trade liberalization are diffuse while the costs tend to be concentrated in well defined 
6:160:12549:22:23:64:533:601:133:Times:133:Times:groups that benefit from protection. Thus, the political attention directed towards trade liberalizations 
6:161:12655:23:22:64:545:578:133:Times:133:Times:often emphasizes the adjustment costs born by formerly protected workers, and there is a corresponding 
6:162:12758:22:23:64:539:556:133:Times:133:Times:empirical economics literature devoted to understanding these adjustment costs (see Harrison (2006)).  
6:163:12861:23:22:100:505:533:133:Times:133:Times:How might schooling be influenced by the trade adjustment process? Changes in living 
6:164:12946:22:24:64:523:511:133:Times:133:Times:standards, child labor demand, and returns to education stand out as likely mechanisms. Consider a 
6:165:13045:24:27:64:538:487:133:Times:133:Times:household with one adult, one child, and a single family decision-maker. Denote 0yas the household's

6:169:13444:26:22:64:539:379:133:Times:133:Times:net economic contribution of children in the child labor literature, schooling costs can be considerable. 
6:170:13550:22:23:64:508:357:133:Times:133:Times:In India, primary school tuition is theoretically free, but other direct costs including fees, books,

6:172:13756:22:23:64:379:312:133:Times:133:Times:conform to the social norms of students in the school be substantial.

6:177:14152:23:22:64:516:185:133:Times:133:Times:additively separable from today's consumption.2 For simplicity, we define r as the linear return to

8:247:17225:23:22:64:532:622:133:Times:133:Times:Our analysis of the relationship between schooling, child labor, and exposure to tariff reform through 
8:248:17328:22:23:64:527:600:133:Times:133:Times:employment composition relies primarily on the rural samples in the 43rd (July 87-Jun 88) and 55th 
8:249:17427:23:22:64:541:577:133:Times:133:Times:(July 1999 - June 2000) rounds of India's National Sample Survey (NSS).4 We analyze the activities of 
8:250:17529:22:23:64:535:555:133:Times:133:Times:more than 95,000 children age 10-14. 5 The NSS is a repeated cross-section at the level of individuals 
8:251:17631:23:22:64:519:532:133:Times:133:Times:(households). Districts are matched across rounds, so that data has a geographic panel dimension.  
8:252:17730:22:23:100:549:510:133:Times:133:Times:We consider several measures of the activities of children.6 We define an indicator attend school 
8:253:17827:23:22:64:546:487:133:Times:133:Times:that is one if a child reports attending school in the household roster regardless of his/her usual principal 
8:254:17937:22:23:64:526:465:133:Times:133:Times:activity. We define a child's work status based on a survey question about the child's usual principal 
8:255:18040:23:22:64:529:442:133:Times:133:Times:activity. The question distinguishes between the following categories of work: regular salaried/wage 
8:256:18141:22:23:64:512:420:133:Times:133:Times:employee, casual wage laborer, begging, work in a household enterprise (farm or non-farm), and 
8:257:18236:23:22:64:542:397:133:Times:133:Times:domestic work. A child is labeled working if his/her usual principal activity is in one of the above work 
8:258:18342:22:23:64:517:375:133:Times:133:Times:categories. It is possible that a child's principal activity might be work while the child also attends 
8:259:18446:23:22:64:544:352:133:Times:133:Times:school. We also define an indicator for whether a child works as a principal activity and does not attend 
8:260:18552:22:22:64:351:330:133:Times:133:Times:school (i.e. work only) that we often refer to as “child labor.”  
8:261:18618:22:23:100:533:308:133:Times:133:Times:We organize types of work into two categories. A child works in market work if his/her usual 
8:262:18711:23:22:64:548:285:133:Times:133:Times:principal activity is working for wages (as regular salaried/wage employee or as casual wage laborer), in 
8:263:18817:22:23:64:527:263:133:Times:133:Times:a household enterprise (farm or non-farm), or in begging.  Most children engaged in market work in 
8:264:18916:23:22:64:533:240:133:Times:133:Times:rural areas are working on their family farm or business.  Domestic work includes attending domestic 
8:265:19017:22:36:64:513:218:133:Times:133:Times:duties and free collection of goods (vegetables, roots, fire-wood, cattle feed ...), sewing, tailoring

8:271:19606:12:11:64:528:124:100:Times:100:Times:C182 on the worst forms of child labor. As a household survey, the NSS inevitably misses children who do not live 
8:272:19720:11:12:64:543:113:100:Times:100:Times:within the sampling frame, such as sex workers, trafficked children, bonded laborers, street children, and the homeless. 
8:273:19841:12:7:64:515:101:100:Times:100:Times:We are not able to infer anything about changes in the status of these children during India's trade liberalization. 
8:274:19958:7:16:64:529:94:42:Times:100:Times:6 Changes in the NSS questionnaire over time have created substantive issues for the measurement of consumption, 
8:275:20071:16:11:64:543:78:100:Times:100:Times:poverty, etc (see for example, Tarozzi 2005). However, our measures of the activities of children rely on questions that 
8:276:20192:11:0:64:345:67:100:Times:100:Times:have been asked in a consistent manner in each of the survey rounds.  
9:277:20263:0:22:64:549:716:133:Times:133:Times:weaving, etc. for household use. Policy tends to focus more on market work (and especially wage work), 
9:278:20366:22:23:64:538:694:133:Times:133:Times:but a basic model of time allocation (e.g. Becker 1965) would suggest that movements in market work 
9:279:20466:23:22:64:239:671:133:Times:133:Times:and domestic work should be related. 
9:280:20503:22:23:100:549:649:133:Times:133:Times:Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on schooling and child labor between 1983 and 1999/2000 
9:281:20599:23:22:64:526:626:133:Times:133:Times:for rural India. In addition to the data from 1987 and 2000 that will be mostly used in this paper, we 
9:282:20702:22:23:64:537:604:133:Times:133:Times:have included tabulations from the 38th (Jan-Dec 1983) and 50th (July 1993 - June 1994) rounds of the 
9:283:20804:23:22:64:494:581:133:Times:133:Times:NSS in order to highlight the underlying time trends. Each mean in Table 1 is weighted to be 
9:284:20897:22:23:64:502:559:133:Times:133:Times:representative for rural India in the given year. A clear understanding of the aggregate patterns 
9:285:20995:23:22:64:515:536:133:Times:133:Times:summarized in Table 1 is critical for interpreting the findings in this study. School attendance has 
9:286:21096:22:23:64:544:514:133:Times:133:Times:increased dramatically in rural India over the last twenty years. In 1983, less than half of children 10-14 
9:287:21204:23:22:64:523:491:133:Times:133:Times:attended school. By 1999/2000, nearly three-quarters of children attend school.7 This rise in school 
9:288:21305:22:23:64:536:469:133:Times:133:Times:attendance is concurrent with a 65 percent decline in the fraction of children who are working without 
9:289:21408:23:22:64:541:446:133:Times:133:Times:attending school. More than a third of rural children in 1983 worked without attending school while 14 
9:290:21511:22:23:64:545:424:133:Times:133:Times:percent work without school in 1999/2000.8 The bottom panel separates work into market and domestic 
9:291:21611:23:22:64:549:401:133:Times:133:Times:work. The declines in market work and domestic work are similar in magnitude. Our identification relies 
9:292:21715:22:23:64:513:379:133:Times:133:Times:on between district variations in exposure to national tariff changes.  Hence, we do not assess the 
9:293:21815:23:22:64:505:356:133:Times:133:Times:importance of trade liberalization in these aggregate trends in school attendance or child labor.  
9:294:21914:22:23:100:538:334:133:Times:133:Times:In addition to information about the activities of children, we also use the information on child 
9:295:22012:23:22:64:500:311:133:Times:133:Times:demographics (gender, age) and household attributes (religion, caste or tribe, primary activity, 
9:296:22109:22:23:64:534:289:133:Times:133:Times:household expenditure per capita, household size, information on household head (literacy, competed 
9:297:22209:23:22:64:532:266:133:Times:133:Times:education, gender, age)) from the NSS in our analysis. In our robustness analysis we complement the 
9:298:22309:22:73:64:474:244:133:Times:133:Times:NSS with data from additional sources that are described in detail in the data appendix.   
9:299:22400:73:8:208:211:171:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:300:22448:8:16:64:521:163:42:Times:100:Times:7 There is no central compulsory schooling legislation. 15 states have compulsory schooling laws through age 14, 
9:301:22561:16:11:64:502:147:100:Times:100:Times:mostly passed in the mid 1980s. We are not aware of any attempt to enforce these laws. The potentially most 
9:302:22669:11:12:64:506:136:100:Times:100:Times:substantive changes in education policy over our 1987-1999 period of study are the abolition of tuition fees in 
9:303:22781:12:11:64:504:124:100:Times:100:Times:Government primary schools, scholarship programs aimed at girls and scheduled castes and tribes, Operation 
9:304:22888:11:12:64:537:113:100:Times:100:Times:Blackboard, and a national mid-day meals program. These programs may be important for the overall trends, but they 
9:305:23003:12:7:64:352:101:100:Times:100:Times:do not appear to be correlated with tariff variation as we discuss below. 
9:306:23077:7:16:64:513:94:42:Times:100:Times:8 In theory, child labor in factories, mines, and hazardous activities have been prohibited in India since 1986. In 
9:307:23193:16:11:64:544:78:100:Times:100:Times:practice, serious enforcement of this legislation appears to be beginning in 2006. Most working children in the NSS are 
9:308:23313:11:0:64:535:67:100:Times:100:Times:engaged inside their family enterprise and are outside the scope of this legislation as it is being implemented in 2006. 
10:309:23435:0:22:64:190:716:133:Times:133:Times:3.2 Indian Trade Reform 
10:310:23459:22:23:64:512:694:133:Times:133:Times:India provides an excellent setting to study the relationship between trade policy, child labor and 
10:311:23559:23:22:64:549:671:133:Times:133:Times:schooling. In the August 1991 currency crisis, India initiated unilateral trade liberalization as a condition 
10:312:23669:22:23:64:526:649:133:Times:133:Times:of an IMF bailout. Several features of the trade reform are crucial to our study. First, because tariffs 
10:313:23774:23:22:64:534:626:133:Times:133:Times:were high prior to 1991, the reform drastically reduced the level of tariffs. The average tariff declined 
10:314:23880:22:23:64:548:604:133:Times:133:Times:from 83 % in 1991 to 30% in 1997 (Figure 1).9  Tariff reductions are smaller in some sector than others, 
10:315:23985:23:22:64:524:581:133:Times:133:Times:but all sectors of the economy are affected. Figure 2 depicts average tariffs for cereals and oilseeds, 
10:316:24089:22:23:64:524:559:133:Times:133:Times:agriculture (other than cereals and oilseeds), and manufacturing and mining over time.  Second, the 
10:317:24189:23:22:64:527:536:133:Times:133:Times:liberalization was instigated as part of the IMF program conditions in response to the 1991 currency 
10:318:24290:22:23:64:540:514:133:Times:133:Times:crisis and came as a surprise (Hasan et al, forthcoming).10 The reforms were unanticipated in the sense 
10:319:24394:23:22:64:538:491:133:Times:133:Times:that they were unlikely foreseen in schooling and child labor decisions made by households during the 
10:320:24496:22:23:64:546:469:133:Times:133:Times:1980s and in the district industrial composition before the crisis. In fact, Varshney (1999) reports that as 
10:321:24605:23:23:64:483:446:133:Times:133:Times:late as 1996, less than 20 percent of the electorate had any knowledge of the trade reform.  
10:322:24698:23:23:100:503:423:133:Times:144:Times:Third, the IMF conditions required a reduction in the level and dispersion of tariffs, 
10:323:24785:23:22:64:527:400:133:Times:133:Times:drastically altering the structure of protection (Chopra et al, 1995). Industries with larger pre-reform 
10:324:24890:22:23:64:516:378:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs experienced larger tariff declines. This is not a pattern that would be expected if traditional 
10:325:24994:23:22:64:517:355:133:Times:133:Times:political economy concerns played an important role in India’s trade liberalization of 1991. Goyal 
10:326:25093:22:23:64:524:333:133:Times:133:Times:(1996) argues that the reforms were passed quickly as a sort of "shock therapy" with little debate or 
10:327:25195:23:22:64:532:310:133:Times:133:Times:analysis in order to avoid the inevitable political opposition to such policies. In fact, Topalova (2004, 
10:328:25301:22:23:64:545:288:133:Times:133:Times:2005) shows that tariff changes are not strongly correlated with baseline industry characteristics such as 
10:329:25408:23:22:64:545:265:133:Times:133:Times:productivity or skill intensity at the industry level. This observation is consistent with Gang and Pandey 
10:330:25515:22:22:64:534:243:133:Times:133:Times:(1996) who analyze the determinants of tariffs prior to the 1991 reforms and argue that economic and 
10:331:25616:22:23:64:520:221:133:Times:133:Times:political factors are not useful in explaining industry tariff levels in India at the time of the reform. 
10:332:25722:23:22:64:530:198:133:Times:133:Times:Rather, they argue, tariffs prior to the 1991 reforms reflected India's second five year plan (passed in 
10:333:25827:22:23:64:525:176:133:Times:133:Times:1955) and had not been substantively changed even as industries and the Indian economy changed.  
10:334:25924:23:22:100:531:153:133:Times:133:Times:The 1991 reforms were incorporated directly into India's Eighth Five Year plan (1992-1997). 
10:335:26016:22:18:64:537:131:133:Times:133:Times:Thus, tariff changes through 1997 are spelled out by the 1991 reform and outside of the usual political 
10:336:26120:18:7:208:211:113:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:337:26168:7:12:64:410:106:42:Times:100:Times:9 The sources of tariff data are various publications of the Indian Ministry of Finance. 
10:338:26257:12:16:64:521:94:42:Times:100:Times:10This crisis was in part triggered by the sudden increase in the oil prices due to the Gulf War in 1990, the drop in 
10:339:26375:16:11:64:528:78:100:Times:100:Times:remittances from Indian workers in the Middle East, and the political uncertainty surrounding the fall of a coalition 
10:340:26493:11:0:64:421:67:100:Times:100:Times:government and assassination of Rajiv Gandhi which undermined investor’s confidence. 
11:341:26579:0:22:64:537:716:133:Times:133:Times:economy process. Figure 2 documents an increase in tariffs in some sectors subsequently to the end of 
11:342:26681:22:23:64:539:694:133:Times:133:Times:this plan, which may reflect various political economy factors. Hence, we restrict our attention to tariff 
11:343:26788:23:22:64:532:671:133:Times:133:Times:levels prior to the reform and to levels in 1997. That is, we assign the data from the 55th round of the 
11:344:26893:22:23:64:543:649:133:Times:133:Times:NSS, the 1997 tariff level. This reflects the idea that adjustment to tariffs is gradual (we do not expect a 
11:345:27002:23:22:64:547:626:133:Times:133:Times:tariff change in 1991 to have an immediate impact that works through employment), and the importance 
11:346:27103:22:23:64:301:604:133:Times:133:Times:of using tariff variation that is externally imposed.  
11:347:27158:23:22:100:541:581:133:Times:133:Times:One potential concern with relying on tariff changes alone is that tariffs may be correlated with 
11:348:27256:22:23:64:525:559:133:Times:133:Times:non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). NTB have historically played a large role in Indian trade policy. 
11:349:27359:23:22:64:529:536:133:Times:133:Times:They were gradually removed over the 1990s as a part of the Eighth Five Year plan but more slowly 
11:350:27457:22:23:64:501:514:133:Times:133:Times:than tariffs. We focus on tariffs alone because they are more transparent and easier to measure 
11:351:27553:23:22:64:529:491:133:Times:133:Times:comparably across industries and time than NTBs. In addition, NTB data is not readily available at a 
11:352:27654:22:23:64:517:469:133:Times:133:Times:very detailed industry level. The limited available data on NTBs suggest that tariffs and NTBs are 
11:353:27753:23:22:64:540:446:133:Times:133:Times:positively correlated during this period (higher tariffs, higher NTBs: Topalova 2005) albeit with a time 
11:354:27858:22:23:64:506:424:133:Times:133:Times:lag. Given this positive correlation, it is possible in theory that a portion of the adjustment costs 
11:355:27960:23:22:64:535:401:133:Times:133:Times:attributed to tariffs may owe to NTB declines, although some robustness checks suggest this not to be 
11:356:28062:22:23:64:526:379:133:Times:133:Times:necessarily the case (see the discussion around table 4 below). Despite the slower NTB reforms, the 
11:357:28162:23:22:64:543:356:133:Times:133:Times:tariff changes considered herein are mirrored in increases in imports. The share of merchandise trade in 
11:358:28267:22:24:64:412:334:133:Times:133:Times:GDP increased from about 10% in 1986/87 to about 19% in the late 1990s. 
11:359:28339:24:25:64:191:310:182:Times:182:Times:4. Empirical Strategy 
11:360:28361:25:22:64:226:285:133:Times:133:Times:4.1. Measuring Tariff Protection 
11:361:28394:22:23:64:497:263:133:Times:133:Times:Most studies that use micro level data to evaluate trade reforms focus on their impact through 
11:362:28489:23:22:64:519:240:133:Times:133:Times:employment. These studies typically correlate industry trade or trade policy changes with industry 
11:363:28588:22:23:64:525:218:133:Times:133:Times:employment/wages, or they interact the industry level measures of trade policy with the geographic 
11:364:28687:23:22:64:549:195:133:Times:133:Times:concentration of industries to construct an employment weighted regional exposure of trade reforms (see 
11:365:28791:22:23:64:517:173:133:Times:133:Times:Harrison (2006), Goldberg and Pavcnik (forthcoming) for surveys). As illustrated in Section 2, by 
11:366:28889:23:22:64:538:150:133:Times:133:Times:measuring the effect of tariff changes through employment, this approach emphasizes the mechanisms 
11:367:28988:22:23:64:538:128:133:Times:133:Times:that work through returns to education, family income, and child employment while missing the effect 
11:368:29089:23:0:64:458:105:133:Times:133:Times:on consumption and inputs prices. We return to the latter mechanisms in Section 5.5. 
12:369:29175:0:22:100:536:716:133:Times:133:Times:In this study, we rely on India's considerable geographic diversity in how families are affected 
12:370:29272:22:23:64:509:694:133:Times:133:Times:by the national tariff changes. India is divided into almost 450 districts.11 Districts differ in their 
12:371:29376:23:22:64:524:671:133:Times:133:Times:industrial composition before the 1991 reforms. Our identification strategy exploits this geographic 
12:372:29477:22:23:64:513:649:133:Times:133:Times:heterogeneity within India in exposure to tariff protection. The interaction between the share of a 
12:373:29577:23:22:64:528:626:133:Times:133:Times:district’s population employed by various industries on the eve of trade reforms and the reduction in 
12:374:29679:22:23:64:533:604:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs in these industries provides a measure of the change in a district’s tariff protection. We use the 
12:375:29786:23:22:64:531:581:133:Times:133:Times:phrase "district tariff" to refer to the district level measure of employment based exposure to national 
12:376:29891:22:23:64:387:559:133:Times:133:Times:tariff rates. Product tariffs do not themselves vary at the district level. 
12:377:29967:23:22:100:514:536:133:Times:133:Times: In particular, district d’s "district tariff" at time t is measured by the 1991 district-specific 
12:378:30065:22:23:64:536:514:133:Times:133:Times:industry employment weighted average of nominal, national, industry ad-valorem tariffs at time t. For 
12:379:30167:23:31:64:543:491:133:Times:133:Times:each industry i in district d, we compute employment Empi,d using India’s 1991 population and housing

12:397:30673:23:22:64:545:313:133:Times:133:Times:industrial composition that is determined prior to trade reform. Thus, changes in employment over time

12:399:30875:23:22:100:528:268:133:Times:133:Times: The above tariff measure takes into account employment in traded industries and non-traded 
12:400:30966:22:23:64:519:246:133:Times:133:Times:industries such as services, trade, transportation, construction, and growing of cereals and oilseeds 
12:401:31068:23:22:64:524:223:133:Times:133:Times:within a district.13 Non-traded industries are assigned zero tariffs in all years,14 resulting in average 
12:402:31174:22:19:64:502:201:133:Times:133:Times:district tariffs, substantially lower than average tariffs on traded goods. The top row of Table 2

12:404:31321:7:16:64:538:175:42:Times:100:Times:11The district is an administrative unit within the state, slightly smaller in geographical area than the typical American 
12:405:31444:16:12:64:545:159:100:Times:100:Times:county. Boundaries of the districts have been relatively constant since colonial times, though many of the older districts 
12:406:31567:12:7:64:266:147:100:Times:100:Times:have been split into two or more modern districts. 
12:407:31618:7:16:64:541:140:42:Times:100:Times:12Because the Indian census does not distinguish among various subcategories of agriculture, employment information 
12:408:31734:16:7:64:473:124:100:Times:100:Times:on subcategories of agriculture from the 1987 (i.e. 43rd) round of the National Sample Survey is used. 
12:409:31837:7:16:64:541:117:42:Times:100:Times:13Topalova (2005) argues that the latter two categories should be treated as non-traded because all product lines within 
12:410:31958:16:11:64:536:101:100:Times:100:Times:cereals and oilseeds were canalized (i.e. imports were allowed only by the state trading monopoly) until 2000 and the 
12:411:32076:11:7:64:464:90:100:Times:100:Times:tariffs on all product lines under the growing of cereals are zero throughout the period of our study. 
12:412:32179:7:16:64:546:83:42:Times:100:Times:14 Since our identification strategies relies on the within-district change in trade exposure, it does not matter whether we 
12:413:32304:16:0:64:481:67:100:Times:100:Times:assign non traded industries to have 0 or infinite tariffs as long as these tariffs do not change over time.  
13:414:32416:0:22:64:528:716:133:Times:133:Times:summarizes the time trend in the average district tariff between 1987 and 1999/2000 for the years in 
13:415:32517:22:23:64:518:694:133:Times:133:Times:which we have household survey data.15 The average district tariff in rural areas decreased from 8 
13:416:32616:23:22:64:387:671:133:Times:133:Times:percent in 1987 to 2.5 percent in 2000, a decline of nearly 70 percent. 
13:417:32688:22:23:100:527:649:133:Times:133:Times:District tariffs and tariff changes are heavily influenced by the prevalence of employment in 
13:418:32782:23:22:64:546:626:133:Times:133:Times:non-traded sectors. By construction, everything else equal, districts with greater share of employment in 
13:419:32888:22:23:64:545:604:133:Times:133:Times:non-traded sector have lower district tariffs and lower tariff changes, thus the difference between the 88 
13:420:32995:23:22:64:549:581:133:Times:133:Times:percent average product tariff for 1987 in Figure 1 and the corresponding 8 percent average district tariff 
13:421:33103:22:23:64:528:559:133:Times:133:Times:in Table 2. Subsequently, we create a measure of district tariffs that depends only on employment in 
13:422:33204:23:22:64:523:536:133:Times:133:Times:traded sectors. This measure is constructed along the same lines as the district tariff measure in (5), 
13:423:33308:22:24:64:522:514:133:Times:133:Times:except that the weights use only the employment in traded sectors within a district. We call this the 
13:424:33410:24:27:64:533:490:133:Times:133:Times:"traded tariff" for the district and label it . This tariff measure is correlated with the district 
13:425:33510:27:26:64:545:463:133:Times:133:Times:average tariff , but variation in  is not determined mechanically by the size of the non-
13:426:33599:26:23:64:530:437:133:Times:133:Times:traded sector. The second row of Table 2 documents the evolution in traded tariffs over the period of 
13:427:33701:23:0:64:529:414:133:Times:133:Times:study: in rural areas, the average traded tariff declines from 88 percent in 1987 to 31 percent in 2000.

13:431:33837:27:23:100:529:392:133:Times:133:Times:In order for national tariff changes to have a differential impact on district outcomes through 
13:432:33933:23:22:64:539:369:133:Times:133:Times:employment composition, the district must be the appropriate labor market from the household’s point 
13:433:34034:22:23:64:499:347:133:Times:133:Times:of view. To the extent that the district is either too aggregate or too disaggregate, there will be 
13:434:34134:23:22:64:515:324:133:Times:133:Times:measurement error in our measure of trade exposure. In treating the district as the relevant unit of 
13:435:34235:22:23:64:515:302:133:Times:133:Times:analysis, we are following convention in the micro empirical literature on India (Rosenzweig and 
13:436:34332:23:22:64:549:279:133:Times:133:Times:Evenson 1977, Rosenzweig 1982, Banerjee and Iyer 2005, Duflo and Pande 2007). Part of the reason for 
13:437:34433:22:23:64:526:257:133:Times:133:Times:focusing on district level variation is that there is surprisingly little migration between districts (Das 
13:438:34540:23:22:64:540:234:133:Times:133:Times:Gupta 1987, Topalova 2005, Munshi and Rosenzweig 2005). Topalova (2005) documents that, even in 
13:439:34636:22:23:64:518:212:133:Times:133:Times:2000, less than 2 percent of rural adult males have moved into their current district of residence or 
13:440:34738:23:30:64:531:189:133:Times:133:Times:between urban and rural areas within their district of residence during the last 10 years.17 Temporary

13:442:34889:7:16:64:524:152:42:Times:100:Times:15The tariff measure matched to 1987/88 NSS is based on tariff information for 1987. No detailed data on tariffs is 
13:443:35005:16:12:64:542:136:100:Times:100:Times:available prior to 1987, but there were no major trade reforms prior to 1991. The tariff measure linked to 1999/00 NSS 
13:444:35124:12:7:64:248:124:100:Times:100:Times:round is based on tariff information for 1997. 
13:445:35171:7:16:64:529:117:42:Times:100:Times:16 Tariffs decline in agricultural, mining, and manufacturing sectors. The bottom two rows of table 2 report average 
13:446:35288:16:7:64:524:101:100:Times:100:Times:district tariffs using only traded agricultural sectors (row 3) and traded mining and manufacturing sectors (row 4).  
13:447:35406:7:16:64:546:94:42:Times:100:Times:17 Munshi and Rosenzweig (2005) argue that the critical role played by mutual insurance arrangements within sub-caste 
13:448:35524:16:11:64:545:78:100:Times:100:Times:networks explain why there is so little permanent mobility in India. Das Gupta (1987) argues that implicit ownership of 
13:449:35644:11:0:64:462:67:100:Times:100:Times:common property that is conditional on residency and exclusive of new migrants is also important. 
14:450:35744:0:22:64:510:716:133:Times:133:Times:migration of individual household members for work is probably much more common, although 
14:451:35834:22:23:64:526:694:133:Times:133:Times:temporary out migrants are supposed to be in the household roster and therefore in our dataset. That 
14:452:35935:23:22:64:415:671:133:Times:133:Times:said, as a robustness check, we also conduct the analysis at the region level. 
14:453:36014:22:23:64:194:649:133:Times:133:Times:4.2 Empirical Framework 
14:454:36038:23:22:64:539:626:133:Times:133:Times:Our empirical strategy is straightforward. Indian districts vary in their exposure to trade reforms based 
14:455:36144:22:23:64:529:604:133:Times:133:Times:on the composition of employment prior to the reforms. We compare how schooling and child labor 
14:456:36240:23:22:64:542:581:133:Times:133:Times:changed in districts that differ in the tariff decline that they experience. While we control for individual 
14:457:36349:22:24:64:521:559:133:Times:133:Times:correlates with the detailed micro data of the NSS, it is the district panel dimension of the data that 
14:458:36453:24:27:64:549:535:133:Times:133:Times:generates the variation used to identify the effects of tariff declines on schooling.  is our measure 
14:459:36555:27:0:64:443:508:133:Times:133:Times:of the district d's tariff at time t and is constructed as described in Section 4.1. Let

14:473:37284:22:24:100:545:297:133:Times:133:Times:We control for the average changes in the activities of children across all districts between 1987 
14:474:37383:24:26:64:521:273:133:Times:133:Times:and 1999/2000 with a post-reform (survey-round) fixed effect tτ. Consequently, the coefficient on 
14:475:37481:26:22:64:521:247:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs does not capture any aggregate effects of Indian tariff reforms. Indian districts differ in their 
14:476:37587:22:23:64:518:225:133:Times:133:Times:endowments, schooling facilities, accessibility, geography, etc. and these attributes are potentially 
14:477:37689:23:24:64:511:202:133:Times:133:Times:correlated with tariffs (or industrial composition) and schooling/child labor. We control for time-
14:478:37788:24:25:64:530:178:133:Times:133:Times:invariant district characteristics with a district fixed effectdλ and thus use within district variation in 
14:479:37896:25:23:64:548:153:133:Times:133:Times:tariff exposure to identify the impact of Tariffdt on activity y. Because district tariffs are constructed with 
14:480:38008:23:22:64:510:130:133:Times:133:Times:constant pre-liberalization employment weights, the econometric work is attempting to build the 
14:481:38104:22:23:64:516:108:133:Times:133:Times:counterfactual of how schooling would have changed if the only parameter differing from the pre-
14:482:38200:23:0:64:540:85:133:Times:133:Times:liberalization values were national tariffs on imported goods. Everything else equal, a positive value of 
15:483:38308:0:26:64:524:715:133:Times:133:Times:the coefficient on tariff 1β in (6) would suggest that tariff declines are associated with decreases in 
15:484:38412:26:24:64:238:689:133:Times:133:Times:schooling relative to a national trend. 
15:485:38452:24:26:100:524:665:133:Times:133:Times:The coefficient on tariff1βin (6) is identified under the assumption that unobserved district-
15:486:38546:26:22:64:535:639:133:Times:133:Times:specific time varying shocks that affect schooling/child labor are uncorrelated with changes in district 
15:487:38651:22:23:64:534:617:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs over time. Changes in district tariffs capture the interaction of changes in industry tariffs at the 
15:488:38760:23:22:64:546:594:133:Times:133:Times:national level and initial industrial composition in a district.  Consequently, only differential time-trends 
15:489:38870:22:23:64:514:572:133:Times:133:Times:in schooling that are correlated with both baseline industrial composition and national level tariff 
15:490:38971:23:22:64:539:549:133:Times:133:Times:changes could be a source of bias.  This type of bias is less likely to be a concern in traded sectors.  As 
15:491:39079:22:23:64:538:527:133:Times:133:Times:discussed in Section 3.2, the usual concerns with the political economy of protection are less severe in 
15:492:39184:23:22:64:541:504:133:Times:133:Times:the case of the 1991 Indian reforms.  There was little scope until 1997 for lobbying groups to influence 
15:493:39289:22:23:64:523:482:133:Times:133:Times:tariff changes, and the tariffs in place at the time of reform only weakly reflected contemporaneous 
15:494:39390:23:22:64:541:459:133:Times:133:Times:economic and political circumstances.  A more pressing concern noted in Section 4.1 is that changes in 
15:495:39493:22:23:64:533:437:133:Times:133:Times:the district tariff measure in (5) depend in part on the size of the non-traded sector in a given district.  
15:496:39602:23:22:64:549:414:133:Times:133:Times:The baseline size of the non-traded sector in a district could be associated with differential time trends in 
15:497:39712:22:23:64:187:392:133:Times:133:Times:our outcomes of interest.   
15:498:39740:23:22:100:540:369:133:Times:133:Times:We address this concern in three ways. First, we allow for different time effects across districts 
15:499:39839:22:23:64:529:347:133:Times:133:Times:based on the pre-reform conditions in a district, such as district's employment composition at a more 
15:500:39941:23:22:64:530:324:133:Times:133:Times:aggregate level than the one used in the construction of district tariffs. Pre-reform conditions that are 
15:501:40047:22:23:64:539:302:133:Times:133:Times:interacted with post reform indicator include the share of workers in a district employed in agriculture, 
15:502:40153:23:22:64:533:279:133:Times:133:Times:mining, manufacturing, trade, transport, services (construction is the omitted category), the share of a 
15:503:40258:22:23:64:536:257:133:Times:133:Times:district’s population that is scheduled caste/tribe, the share of literate population in a district, and state 
15:504:40369:23:23:64:539:234:133:Times:133:Times:labor laws indicators as defined in Besley and Burgess (2004). Second, we instrument for district tariff 
15:505:40474:23:26:64:526:211:133:Times:133:Times:with district tariff on traded goods,  (described in Section 4.1), which is not mechanically 
15:506:40567:26:0:64:431:185:133:Times:133:Times:influenced by the size of the non-traded sector. Thus, our main specification is:

16:518:41324:24:23:64:521:645:144:Times:144:Times:allow for the pre-reform changes in outcome variables to have a time-varying impact in (7). In 
16:519:41419:23:24:64:526:622:144:Times:144:Times:section 5.3, we verify that the results on schooling and literacy are restricted only to children of 
16:520:41520:24:23:64:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:school age during the 1990s. The results from these robustness checks are all consistent with our 
16:521:41618:23:25:64:251:575:144:Times:144:Times:basic findings, to which we turn next.  
16:522:41656:25:25:64:165:550:182:Times:182:Times:5. Main Findings 
16:523:41673:25:22:64:181:525:133:Times:133:Times:5.1. School Attendance  
16:524:41697:22:22:64:541:503:133:Times:133:Times:In rural India in the 1990s, school attendance increased by less in districts that experienced larger tariff 
16:525:41806:22:23:64:542:481:133:Times:133:Times:declines. This is apparent in Table 3 which contains the basic findings. Column 1 shows the coefficient 
16:526:41910:23:22:64:531:458:133:Times:133:Times:on district tariff and on the post-reform indicator from the OLS estimation of equation (6). Column 2 
16:527:42012:22:23:64:533:436:133:Times:133:Times:presents the IV estimates of equation (7), the main specification of the paper. With all of the included 
16:528:42117:23:22:64:526:413:133:Times:133:Times:time trends, the post-reform effect is not reported in column 2 and in all subsequent regressions that 
16:529:42220:22:23:64:540:391:133:Times:133:Times:include differential time trends across districts. In all specifications, standard errors are clustered at the 
16:530:42331:23:22:64:152:368:133:Times:133:Times:state-year level.18  
16:531:42352:22:23:100:546:346:133:Times:133:Times:Both the OLS and IV estimates suggest that larger tariff declines in a district are associated with 
16:532:42452:23:22:64:545:323:133:Times:133:Times:lower schooling attendance (relative to national trends).  It is important to interpret this in the context of 
16:533:42563:22:23:64:539:301:133:Times:133:Times:the impressive progress in school attendance throughout India during this period. As the coefficient on 
16:534:42667:23:22:64:516:278:133:Times:133:Times:the post-reform indicator in column 1 suggests, in districts that experience no change in tariff, the 
16:535:42769:22:23:64:542:256:133:Times:133:Times:regression adjusted probability a child is in school increases by 17 percentage points between 1987 and 
16:536:42873:23:22:64:529:233:133:Times:133:Times:2000. Everything else equal, the average district tariff decline (.05) is associated with a 2 percentage 
16:537:42978:22:23:64:547:211:133:Times:133:Times:point decline in schooling relative to the national baseline. Thus, a district with the average tariff change 
16:538:43088:23:22:64:507:188:133:Times:133:Times:experienced a 15 percentage point increase in schooling, 12 percent below the national trend.19  
16:539:43185:22:23:100:491:166:133:Times:133:Times: The decline in district tariffs varies between 0 to 59 percentage points. In the district 
16:540:43275:23:30:64:527:143:133:Times:133:Times:experiencing the largest tariff change, the probability that a child attends school actually falls by 4.5 
16:541:43381:30:7:208:211:113:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
16:542:43429:7:12:64:462:106:42:Times:100:Times:18We have one year of data prior to the reform and one year of data after the reform, 13 years later. 
16:543:43531:12:16:64:523:94:42:Times:100:Times:19 No single sector is driving our findings. We observe this result (attenuated schooling increases with larger tariff 
16:544:43650:16:11:64:535:78:100:Times:100:Times:declines) in 76 of the 233 traded sectors when the reduced form of our main specification is estimated using district's 
16:545:43770:11:0:64:249:67:100:Times:100:Times:exposure to tariffs for each sector separately.  
17:546:43821:0:22:64:542:716:133:Times:133:Times:percentage points after the trade reforms (compared to the 17 percentage point rise observed in districts 
17:547:43927:22:23:64:544:694:133:Times:133:Times:with no tariff change). However, as the standard deviation of the average tariff change (-0.055) is rather 
17:548:44034:23:22:64:527:671:133:Times:133:Times:small (0.06), extreme tariff changes where the implied effects predict absolute declines in schooling 
17:549:44136:22:23:64:544:649:133:Times:133:Times:between 1987 and 2000 are not typical. For almost all districts, the observed tariff changes are not large 
17:550:44243:23:22:64:488:626:133:Times:133:Times:enough to reverse the progress in schooling and child labor reduction in the 1990s in India.  
17:551:44337:22:23:64:227:604:133:Times:133:Times:5.2 Robustness of Basic Findings 
17:552:44370:23:22:64:537:581:133:Times:133:Times:The tariff - schooling relationship captured so far would be biased if the measure of tariff changes in a 
17:553:44476:22:23:64:533:559:133:Times:133:Times:district is correlated with omitted district-level time-varying factors that affect school attendance. We 
17:554:44582:23:22:64:520:536:133:Times:133:Times:examine whether districts with different industrial compositions and tariff changes had similar pre-
17:555:44682:22:23:64:544:514:133:Times:133:Times:reform time trends in school attendance. We test whether the findings are confounded by other reforms, 
17:556:44785:23:22:64:535:491:133:Times:133:Times:concurrent to trade liberalization. Finally, we investigate whether investments in school infrastructure 
17:557:44890:22:23:64:340:469:133:Times:133:Times:are correlated with the district’s exposure to trade reforms.  
17:558:44953:23:22:100:539:446:133:Times:133:Times:We first focus on pre-existing trends in outcome variables. We directly test whether our results 
17:559:45050:22:23:64:531:424:133:Times:133:Times:reflect pre-existing time trends in schooling that are correlated with post-reform changes in tariffs by 
17:560:45155:23:22:64:538:401:133:Times:133:Times:estimating equation (7) with data from the 38th (1983) and 43rd (1987-88) round of the NSS, both prior 
17:561:45258:22:23:64:526:379:133:Times:133:Times:to the 1991 reforms. This analysis can be performed only using tariff variation at the region level as 
17:562:45361:23:22:64:541:356:133:Times:133:Times:district identifiers are not available in the 38th round of the NSS.20  We assign pre-reform tariffs (1987) 
17:563:45469:22:23:64:533:334:133:Times:133:Times:to 38th round and post-reform tariffs (1997) to 43rd round. The results of this exercise are presented in 
17:564:45575:23:22:64:548:311:133:Times:133:Times:column 4. In column 3, we provide a region level variant of column 2 for comparison. If the pre-existing 
17:565:45680:22:23:64:541:289:133:Times:133:Times:trends in school attendance were correlated with the region's tariff reduction shock, then the coefficient 
17:566:45787:23:22:64:545:266:133:Times:133:Times:on regional tariff in data before trade reform (column 4) will be similar to the coefficient estimated with 
17:567:45895:22:22:64:532:244:133:Times:133:Times:data before and after the reform (column 3). In fact, the pre-reform coefficient is opposite in sign and 
17:568:46000:22:23:64:524:222:133:Times:133:Times:much smaller in magnitude. As an additional check in column (5), we allow the pre-reform trend in 
17:569:46098:23:22:64:547:199:133:Times:133:Times:schooling in a region to have a time-varying effect (we interact the trend with a post reform indicator) in 
17:570:46206:22:23:64:537:177:133:Times:133:Times:our main specification in equation (7). Both the magnitude and statistical significance of the estimated 
17:571:46311:23:22:64:347:154:133:Times:133:Times:impact of tariff remain similar to those reported in column 2. 
17:572:46374:22:23:100:543:132:133:Times:133:Times:During the 1990s, India implemented several other reforms concurrent with trade liberalization. 
17:573:46470:23:19:64:510:109:133:Times:133:Times:Some of the more notable reforms include a removal of licenses regulating operations in various 
17:574:46566:19:7:208:211:90:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
17:575:46614:7:16:64:547:83:42:Times:100:Times:20India is divided into 77 regions and a region is a collection of several districts. Regional tariffs are created in a manner 
17:576:46741:16:0:64:260:67:100:Times:100:Times:that parallels the creation of district-level tariffs. 
18:577:46798:0:22:64:548:716:133:Times:133:Times:industries (Aghion, Burgess, Redding and Zilliboti 2006), relaxation of entry regulation of foreign direct 
18:578:46905:22:23:64:549:694:133:Times:133:Times:investment, and substantial reforms in the financial and banking sectors. Following Topalova (2005), we 
18:579:47009:23:22:64:530:671:133:Times:133:Times:construct district employment-weighted share of industries subject to industrial licensing and district 
18:580:47113:22:23:64:508:649:133:Times:133:Times:employment-weighted share of industries open to FDI (see data appendix). The number of bank 
18:581:47205:23:22:64:521:626:133:Times:133:Times:branches per capita in a district controls for the possibly confounding effect of banking reforms. In 
18:582:47307:22:23:64:543:604:133:Times:133:Times:columns 2-4 of Table 4, we estimate equation (7) with these additional controls.  Neither the magnitude 
18:583:47411:23:22:64:524:581:133:Times:133:Times:nor the statistical significance of the coefficient on district tariff is sensitive to including these time-
18:584:47519:22:23:64:509:559:133:Times:133:Times:varying district measures of reforms. We view these reform variables simply as controls and the 
18:585:47615:23:22:64:539:536:133:Times:133:Times:coefficients on them do not warrant a causal interpretation. We also verify that the results are robust to 
18:586:47722:22:23:64:543:514:133:Times:133:Times:the inclusion of exports, by including the district employment-weighted industry exports (column 5). In 
18:587:47826:23:22:64:515:491:133:Times:133:Times:sum, we find little evidence that our findings reflect other reforms concurrent with the 1991 tariff 
18:588:47927:22:23:64:118:469:133:Times:133:Times:reductions. 
18:589:47939:23:22:100:505:446:133:Times:133:Times:Over the 1990s, substantial policy attention has been directed towards the promotion of 
18:590:48027:22:23:64:545:424:133:Times:133:Times:schooling in India, which could confound our results if schooling policy changes are correlated with the 
18:591:48132:23:22:64:507:401:133:Times:133:Times:district’s exposure to trade reforms.21 However, there is no reason to suspect that programs like 
18:592:48230:22:23:64:543:379:133:Times:133:Times:Operation Blackboard (Chin 2005), the District Primary Education Project launched in November 1994 
18:593:48329:23:22:64:547:356:133:Times:133:Times:(Pandey 2001), or mid-day meals (Dreze and Kingdon 2001) are correlated with district tariff changes.22 
18:594:48432:22:23:64:534:334:133:Times:133:Times:We examine education infrastructure changes using data on primary schools per capita from the 1991 
18:595:48531:23:22:64:549:311:133:Times:133:Times:census and the 7th (2002) All India Education Survey (AIES) and additional detail on schooling facilities 
18:596:48637:22:23:64:535:289:133:Times:133:Times:at the district level from the 6th (1993) and 7th AIES.23 We mimic our main specification and regress 
18:597:48739:23:22:64:549:266:133:Times:133:Times:several measures of district school quantity and quality on the corresponding district tariff, a post-reform 
18:598:48848:22:22:64:547:244:133:Times:133:Times:indicator, pre-reform district characteristics interacted with the post-reform indicator, and instrument for 
18:599:48957:22:28:64:509:222:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs with traded tariffs. The results are in Table 5. None of the correlations between schooling 
18:600:49057:28:8:208:211:194:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
18:601:49105:8:16:64:538:186:42:Times:100:Times:21 The absence of any major policy interventions related to child labor in the 1990s is a major source of grief for child 
18:602:49227:16:11:64:541:170:100:Times:100:Times:labor activists in India. Most of the actions that occurred in the later part of the decade involved listing certain types of 
18:603:49353:11:12:64:542:159:100:Times:100:Times:employment as "worst-forms" and thereby prohibited. Enforcement of these regulations appears to have begun as early 
18:604:49469:12:7:64:429:147:100:Times:100:Times:as 2003 in some states although few children in our dataset are involved in these activities. 
18:605:49563:7:16:64:511:140:42:Times:100:Times:22 In unreported regressions, we estimate our main IV specification (7) using as dependent variables household 
18:606:49673:16:11:64:516:124:100:Times:100:Times:responses on the prevalence of scholarships, free mid-day meals, and free tuition from the 42nd and 52nd (small 
18:607:49785:11:12:64:543:113:100:Times:100:Times:sample) rounds of the NSS. Estimates of the changes in these aspects of schooling costs with tariffs are close to zero in 
18:608:49907:12:7:64:229:101:100:Times:100:Times:magnitude and statistically insignificant. 
18:609:49950:7:16:64:543:94:42:Times:100:Times:23 The 6th round of the AIES is the earliest available at the district level. As it occurs slightly more than a year after the 
18:610:50077:16:11:64:516:78:100:Times:100:Times:initial tariff reforms are implemented, we treat it as a baseline. However, due to the ambiguous timing, results in 
18:611:50193:11:0:64:287:67:100:Times:100:Times:columns 3-6 of Table 5 should be viewed with caution. 
19:612:50249:0:22:64:548:716:133:Times:133:Times:infrastructure and tariffs are statistically significant. If anything, larger tariff declines are associated with 
19:613:50363:22:23:64:516:694:133:Times:133:Times:an increase in the number of primary schools and the number of primary schools per capita, and a 
19:614:50460:23:22:64:526:671:133:Times:133:Times:decline in pupil teacher ratios. If more schools (Duflo 2001) or lower pupil-teacher ratios (Case and 
19:615:50562:22:23:64:534:649:133:Times:133:Times:Deaton 1999) lead to increased schooling, our estimate of the impact of tariffs on schooling would be 
19:616:50664:23:22:64:531:626:133:Times:133:Times:downward biased. Overall, these findings are consistent with our review of education and child labor 
19:617:50765:22:23:64:497:604:133:Times:133:Times:policy in India over the 1990s – while there is considerable activity, there are no district level 
19:618:50864:23:22:64:388:581:133:Times:133:Times:interventions that are obviously correlated with district tariff changes. 
19:619:50938:22:23:100:527:559:133:Times:133:Times:Not surprisingly, controlling for the number of primary schools per capita in a district in our 
19:620:51034:23:22:64:549:536:133:Times:133:Times:basic specification has little overall effect on our estimates of how schooling changes with tariff declines 
19:621:51143:22:23:64:510:514:133:Times:133:Times:(Table 4, column 6). The number of primary schools per capita is positively (but insignificantly) 
19:622:51241:23:22:64:513:491:133:Times:133:Times:correlated with school attendance, however its inclusion does not affect the coefficient on tariffs. 
19:623:51342:22:23:64:549:469:133:Times:133:Times:Column 7 of Table 4 estimates equation (7) controlling for the number of primary schools per capita in a 
19:624:51447:23:22:64:536:446:133:Times:133:Times:district and all other district measures of time-varying policy.  The estimate of tariff coefficient barely 
19:625:51555:22:23:64:107:424:133:Times:133:Times:changes. 
19:626:51564:23:22:64:129:401:133:Times:133:Times:5.3 Literacy  
19:627:51578:22:23:64:542:379:133:Times:133:Times:If districts that were subject to larger tariff declines experienced smaller increases in school attendance, 
19:628:51687:23:22:64:546:356:133:Times:133:Times:we should also observe diminished literacy in those districts relative to the national trend. However, this 
19:629:51795:22:23:64:521:334:133:Times:133:Times:effect should be concentrated only among cohorts who were of school going age during the 1990s. 
19:630:51891:23:22:64:546:311:133:Times:133:Times:Trade reforms should have no impact on literacy of those who had already completed their schooling by 
19:631:51993:22:23:64:539:289:133:Times:133:Times:1991. If most children engaged in primary school in rural India are age 15 or younger, it is implausible 
19:632:52098:23:22:64:346:266:133:Times:133:Times:to observe tariff effects on individuals above age 25 in 2001. 
19:633:52161:22:22:100:530:244:133:Times:133:Times: We use the 1991 and 2001 rural population census to examine the correlation between tariffs 
19:634:52253:22:23:64:537:222:133:Times:133:Times:and literacy by age. Both censuses report district level aggregates of literacy. We regress literacy rates 
19:635:52360:23:22:64:529:199:133:Times:133:Times:for each age group separately (for example, 14 year olds) in a district d at time t on the district tariff, 
19:636:52468:22:23:64:524:177:133:Times:133:Times:post-reform indicator, district fixed effects, pre-reform district conditions (the share of workers in a

19:638:52673:22:23:64:534:132:133:Times:133:Times:district’s population that is a scheduled caste/tribe, and state labor laws indicators) interacted with the 
19:639:52781:23:22:64:525:109:133:Times:133:Times:post-reform indicator, and instrument for tariffs with traded tariffs. The estimated coefficient on the 
19:640:52885:22:0:64:503:87:133:Times:133:Times:tariff measure and the 95 percent confidence interval for each age group is plotted on Figure 3. 
20:641:52984:0:22:100:531:716:133:Times:133:Times: The results on the impact of tariffs on literacy mirror the school attendance results. Our basic 
20:642:53081:22:23:64:546:694:133:Times:133:Times:results in Table 3 compare the schooling attendance of children ages 10-14 in 1999 with that of children 
20:643:53186:23:22:64:540:671:133:Times:133:Times:ages 10-14 in 1987. In Figure 3 we observe that larger tariff declines are associated with lower literacy 
20:644:53292:22:23:64:540:649:133:Times:133:Times:rates for children 10-14 in 2001 relative to children 10-14 in 1991.24  The decline in literacy with tariff 
20:645:53400:23:22:64:546:626:133:Times:133:Times:declines (relative to the time trends) is similar in magnitude to what is observed for school attendance in 
20:646:53508:22:23:64:549:604:133:Times:133:Times:the NSS.  The reduction in literacy with tariff declines extends to the 15-19 age group. Children 15-19 in 
20:647:53615:23:22:64:546:581:133:Times:133:Times:2001 were educated during the tariff adjustment process (they were 5-9 in 1991). Hence, the association 
20:648:53719:22:23:64:508:559:133:Times:133:Times:between tariff declines and the literacy of this older cohort is consistent with our basic findings. 
20:649:53820:23:22:100:537:536:133:Times:133:Times:Perhaps the most important finding in Figure 3 is the result from the falsification exercise. We 
20:650:53917:22:23:64:515:514:133:Times:133:Times:do not observe any false treatment effects in older populations whose schooling should largely be 
20:651:54015:23:22:64:502:491:133:Times:133:Times:completed by the time of the reforms. The correlation between tariffs and the literacy for older 
20:652:54112:22:23:64:527:469:133:Times:133:Times:populations are close to zero. For example, an individual age 20 at the time of reforms is unlikely to 
20:653:54215:23:22:64:515:446:133:Times:133:Times:have his literacy affected by the 1991 reforms. He would be age 30 in 2001, and we observe little 
20:654:54313:22:23:64:543:424:133:Times:133:Times:correlation between tariff changes and literacy rates for the age 30 population. The association between 
20:655:54418:23:22:64:499:401:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs and schooling is concentrated in the populations that should be affected by the reforms. 
20:656:54515:22:23:64:180:379:133:Times:133:Times:5.4 Selective Migration 
20:657:54539:23:22:64:546:356:133:Times:133:Times:Selective migration might be a source of bias in our school attendance findings if families with a greater 
20:658:54646:22:23:64:545:334:133:Times:133:Times:propensity to educate their children move away from districts with larger tariff declines.  Permanent out 
20:659:54752:23:22:64:545:311:133:Times:133:Times:of district migration is very low, and we do not directly observe large population movements associated 
20:660:54856:22:23:64:537:289:133:Times:133:Times:with tariff declines. In the first three columns of Table 6, we mimic our basic approach in equation (7) 
20:661:54961:23:22:64:527:266:133:Times:133:Times:using log population counts by district as a dependent variable and regress it on a district tariff, post-
20:662:55067:22:22:64:513:244:133:Times:133:Times:reform indicator, pre-reform district characteristics interacted with the post-reform indicator, and 
20:663:55168:22:23:64:531:222:133:Times:133:Times:instrument for tariffs with traded tariffs.  We do not observe significant changes in population counts 
20:664:55272:23:22:64:156:199:133:Times:133:Times:with tariff changes. 
20:665:55293:22:23:100:541:177:133:Times:133:Times: It is possible that within a relatively fixed population base, there is a change in the composition 
20:666:55393:23:22:64:516:154:133:Times:133:Times:of the population driving our findings.  In the last three columns of table 6, we estimate the above 
20:667:55494:22:23:64:517:132:133:Times:133:Times:specification with the ratio of males to females in a district as the dependent variable.  We find no 
20:668:55596:23:19:64:538:109:133:Times:133:Times:evidence of significant changes in the gender mix with tariff variation.  Figure 3 is also informative on 
20:669:55702:19:7:208:211:90:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
20:670:55750:7:16:64:538:83:42:Times:100:Times:24One possible mechanism for the schooling attendance findings is the sustained impact of a transitory shock in utero, 
20:671:55869:16:0:64:438:67:100:Times:100:Times:but the persistence across treated ages in Figure 3 is not what that explanation would predict. 
21:672:55967:0:22:64:526:716:133:Times:133:Times:whether there are changes in the literacy of the adult population.  Namely, if tariff declines lead to a 
21:673:56072:22:23:64:519:694:133:Times:133:Times:departure of literate adults (who are more likely to educate their children), then we should observe 
21:674:56173:23:22:64:519:671:133:Times:133:Times:effects of tariffs on the literacy of the adult population.  The absence of such evidence in Figure 3, 
21:675:56276:22:23:64:531:649:133:Times:133:Times:coupled with the insignificant evidence on population counts and sex ratios documented in table 6, is 
21:676:56378:23:22:64:531:626:133:Times:133:Times:inconsistent with substantive changes in population and its composition associated with employment 
21:677:56477:22:23:64:100:604:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs.  
21:678:56487:23:22:64:188:581:133:Times:133:Times:5.5 Other trade channels 
21:679:56512:22:23:64:544:559:133:Times:133:Times:The focus on an employment based measure of exposure to tariff is standard in the trade literature. This 
21:680:56617:23:22:64:539:536:133:Times:133:Times:reflects the belief that it is the labor market where the adjustment costs will be most evident. However, 
21:681:56723:22:23:64:543:514:133:Times:133:Times:tariff changes will also influence households through consumption and intermediate input prices. These 
21:682:56826:23:22:64:522:491:133:Times:133:Times:consumption and intermediate input channels are likely important for the aggregate effects of tariff 
21:683:56927:22:23:64:541:469:133:Times:133:Times:reductions, but they do not appear to be a substantive source of bias in our estimates of the relationship 
21:684:57034:23:22:64:417:446:133:Times:133:Times:between schooling and declines in final product protection on employment.  
21:685:57109:22:23:100:503:424:133:Times:133:Times:Tariff-induced declines in consumer prices should have an income effect that increases 
21:686:57196:23:22:64:542:401:133:Times:133:Times:schooling and a substitution effect that encourages families to consume more consumption goods at the 
21:687:57298:22:23:64:542:379:133:Times:133:Times:expense of schooling and leisure. The consumption effects are absorbed by the post-reform indicator in 
21:688:57401:23:22:64:527:356:133:Times:133:Times:equation (7) if individuals in different districts consume the same consumption bundle and prices of 
21:689:57502:22:23:64:547:334:133:Times:133:Times:goods equalize across districts. For falling consumer prices to generate our findings above, consumption 
21:690:57607:23:22:64:549:311:133:Times:133:Times:bundles would need to vary with the composition of employment and the substitution effect of consumer 
21:691:57709:22:23:64:545:289:133:Times:133:Times:price changes would have to dominate the income effect. We find no hint of this in table 7. We estimate 
21:692:57813:23:22:64:548:266:133:Times:133:Times:our main specification (7) by including a district specific consumption weighted tariff as a regressor (see 
21:693:57921:22:22:64:530:244:133:Times:133:Times:data appendix for construction). Column 1 of table 7 reproduces our main specification from table 3. 
21:694:58022:22:23:64:528:222:133:Times:133:Times:Column 2 reports results when we estimate our main specification (7) with consumption tariff as the 
21:695:58122:23:22:64:522:199:133:Times:133:Times:main independent variable of interest, and column 3 reports estimates of the coefficients of interest 
21:696:58224:22:52:64:537:177:133:Times:133:Times:when we include both the employment weighted tariff and the consumption tariff in equation 7.25 The 
21:697:58324:52:8:208:211:125:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
21:698:58372:8:16:64:541:117:42:Times:100:Times:25 Two important caveats regarding the consumption results need to be discussed. First, they are imprecise. The results 
21:699:58492:16:11:64:540:101:100:Times:100:Times:in column 2 of table 7 are consistent with an increase in schooling of 17 percentage points or a decline of 8 percentage 
21:700:58613:11:12:64:529:90:100:Times:100:Times:points at the mean consumption tariff change relative to a district with no change. Second, we do not instrument for 
21:701:58730:12:11:64:532:78:100:Times:100:Times:consumption tariffs. Bias might arise if tariff changes are larger on products that are consumed disproportionately in 
21:702:58849:11:0:64:322:67:100:Times:100:Times:rich communities. However, no obvious solution presents itself. 
22:703:58915:0:22:64:546:716:133:Times:133:Times:estimated impact of employment weighted tariff on school attendance conditional on consumption tariff 
22:704:59017:22:23:64:399:694:133:Times:133:Times:in column 3 is very similar to what we obtain in our main specification.  
22:705:59091:23:22:100:531:671:133:Times:133:Times: For declining intermediate input prices to generate our findings above, declining input prices 
22:706:59186:22:23:64:548:649:133:Times:133:Times:would need to lower family incomes or increase child labor's productivity. This later channel is unlikely, 
22:707:59293:23:22:64:547:626:133:Times:133:Times:because the changes in schooling do not appear to be driven by increases in child employment in market 
22:708:59396:22:23:64:542:604:133:Times:133:Times:work (section 6.2). To explore whether our results reflect the effect of tariffs on input prices rather than 
22:709:59505:23:22:64:546:581:133:Times:133:Times:declining final product protection, we estimate our main specification in (7) using the district's exposure 
22:710:59613:22:23:64:542:559:133:Times:133:Times:to tariffs on inputs as a regressor (see data appendix). Input tariffs suffer from the same concerns as our 
22:711:59721:23:22:64:539:536:133:Times:133:Times:employment tariff, and we create an analogous instrument of input tariffs for traded goods. The results 
22:712:59825:22:23:64:540:514:133:Times:133:Times:are presented in column 4 and 5 of Table 7.  Though the estimates are extremely imprecise, input tariff 
22:713:59929:23:22:64:524:491:133:Times:133:Times:declines are associated with higher levels of schooling (column 4), suggesting that the now cheaper 
22:714:60029:22:23:64:541:469:133:Times:133:Times:inputs either substitute for child labor or have a positive income effect. The estimates of the coefficient 
22:715:60137:23:22:64:542:446:133:Times:133:Times:on employment weighted tariff conditional on input tariffs and consumption tariffs (column 5) increase 
22:716:60240:22:23:64:540:424:133:Times:133:Times:slightly, but they are not statistically different from basic results in column 1. Overall, our basic results 
22:717:60350:23:24:64:518:401:133:Times:133:Times:do not appear to be driven by other trade channels working through either consumption or inputs.  
22:718:60448:24:25:64:153:377:182:Times:182:Times:6. Mechanisms 
22:719:60462:25:22:64:529:352:133:Times:133:Times:Why do districts with more concentrated pre-reform employment in industries that experience larger 
22:720:60561:22:22:64:514:330:133:Times:133:Times:tariff declines observe smaller increases in school attendance (relative to the national trend)? The 
22:721:60662:22:23:64:529:308:133:Times:133:Times:conceptual framework in Section 2 suggests that declines in returns to education, increases in child's 
22:722:60765:23:22:64:526:285:133:Times:133:Times:economic contribution to household/child labor demand, or declines in living standards/increases in 
22:723:60865:22:23:64:549:263:133:Times:133:Times:poverty in communities where employment lost tariff protection may be responsible. The analysis below 
22:724:60967:23:22:64:513:240:133:Times:133:Times:finds little evidence in favor of declining returns to education or increases in child labor demand. 
22:725:61068:22:23:64:540:218:133:Times:133:Times:Instead, the observed declines in schooling reflect increases in poverty (relative to national baseline) in 
22:726:61176:23:22:64:529:195:133:Times:133:Times:districts where employment lost final product protection. The observed connection between poverty, 
22:727:61275:22:0:64:366:173:133:Times:133:Times:schooling, and child labor seems to be driven by schooling costs. 
23:728:61343:0:22:64:190:716:133:Times:133:Times:6.1 Returns to Education 
23:729:61368:22:23:64:512:694:133:Times:133:Times:If tariff declines lead to a relative reduction in the returns to education in districts that were more 
23:730:61472:23:22:64:509:671:133:Times:133:Times:exposed to the reforms, schooling will decline with tariffs.26 Households might gauge returns to 
23:731:61569:22:23:64:529:649:133:Times:133:Times:schooling both by assessing school quality and by observing the labor market. We have already seen 
23:732:61668:23:22:64:536:626:133:Times:133:Times:evidence against a strong school quality decline correlated with tariff changes (Table 5). In fact, pupil-
23:733:61774:22:23:64:538:604:133:Times:133:Times:teacher ratio changes are consistent with increasing school quality when tariffs decline. In this section, 
23:734:61881:23:22:64:540:581:133:Times:133:Times:we consider whether there is evidence of decreases in the returns to education in either the expenditure 
23:735:61986:22:23:64:512:559:133:Times:133:Times:or adult employment data. Because of innumerable measurement problems, we do not attempt to 
23:736:62078:23:22:64:429:536:133:Times:56:Times:directly measure returns to education and pursue a more inferential approach.27
23:737:62157:22:23:100:523:514:133:Times:133:Times:First, we compare per capita expenditures of households with literate and illiterate heads of 
23:738:62251:23:22:64:547:491:133:Times:133:Times:household as a measure of the return to education.28 This assumes that individuals infer future returns to 
23:739:62358:22:23:64:549:469:133:Times:133:Times:education by comparing the living standards of the literate to those of the illiterate. Given the high levels 
23:740:62468:23:22:64:521:446:133:Times:133:Times:of illiteracy in rural India, literacy is potentially the most obvious measure of education that can be 
23:741:62572:22:23:64:546:424:133:Times:133:Times:observed outside of an individual's household. Neighbors are more likely to know whether someone can 
23:742:62673:23:22:64:394:401:133:Times:133:Times:read or write than whether he has completed 3 or 4 years of education.  
23:743:62745:22:23:100:509:379:133:Times:133:Times:We relate the relative expenditures of literate and illiterate households in a district to the 
23:744:62840:23:22:64:548:356:133:Times:133:Times:employment weighted tariff using an approach parallel to equation (7). We regress the ratio of per capita 
23:745:62946:22:23:64:534:334:133:Times:133:Times:expenditure in literate households to illiterate households in a district at time t on a district tariff, post-
23:746:63057:23:22:64:513:311:133:Times:133:Times:reform indicator, pre-reform district characteristics interacted with the post-reform indicator, and 
23:747:63158:22:23:64:542:289:133:Times:133:Times:instrument for tariffs with traded tariffs. Our findings are in Table 8.  Each column header indicates the 
23:748:63265:23:22:64:544:266:133:Times:133:Times:dependent variable. Standard errors are large relative to the estimated coefficients, but the negative sign 
23:749:63373:22:22:64:542:244:133:Times:133:Times:on the tariff coefficient in all but one specification is most consistent with increases in the expenditures 
23:750:63482:22:28:64:534:222:133:Times:133:Times:of the literate relative to that of the illiterate with tariff declines.29 We observe a similar finding when 
23:751:63591:28:8:208:211:194:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
23:752:63639:8:16:64:547:186:42:Times:100:Times:26 For this to be the mechanism behind the observed correlation between tariffs and schooling, returns to education need 
23:753:63760:16:7:64:425:170:100:Times:100:Times:to vary at the district level. Hence, we discuss returns to education under this assumption. 
23:754:63853:7:16:64:544:163:42:Times:100:Times:27 Measuring returns to education for each district is a challenge. Current labor market returns may not be a good proxy 
23:755:63974:16:11:64:526:147:100:Times:100:Times:for expected future returns. The observed average returns may not equal the marginal return relevant for a family’s 
23:756:64090:11:12:64:524:136:100:Times:100:Times:decision-making. Estimates of returns based on observed wages will be biased by non-random selection into wage 
23:757:64201:12:11:64:546:124:100:Times:100:Times:work. In addition, we face a data problem: information on wages is missing for most individuals in our baseline data. In 
23:758:64322:11:12:64:547:113:100:Times:100:Times:general, around 30 percent of individuals report working for wages in rural areas in various NSS rounds. However, only 
23:759:64441:12:7:64:357:101:100:Times:100:Times:7 percent of individuals report wages in rural areas in 43rd round of NSS. 
23:760:64516:7:11:64:247:94:42:Times:100:Times:28 We thank Esther Duflo for this suggestion. 
23:761:64562:11:16:64:537:83:42:Times:100:Times:29 There are two ways to measure per capita expenditures in the NSS data. In columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 we use per capita 
23:762:64680:16:0:64:544:67:100:Times:100:Times:expenditure measures from the detailed expenditure modules (Schedule 1). There is a substantive questionnaire change 
24:763:64799:0:22:64:547:716:133:Times:133:Times:we split the sample by primary school completion rather than literacy of household head (columns 5 and 
24:764:64902:22:23:64:542:694:133:Times:133:Times:6). Overall, the evidence in table 8 is more consistent with increasing, rather than decreasing, returns to 
24:765:65010:23:22:64:117:671:133:Times:133:Times:education.  
24:766:65022:22:23:100:531:649:133:Times:133:Times:Adult employment changes are also consistent with increasing returns to education. We infer 
24:767:65114:23:22:64:543:626:133:Times:133:Times:what might be happening to returns to schooling by examining the employment of adult males (ages 25-
24:768:65214:22:23:64:543:604:133:Times:133:Times:50) in wage work by literacy status and tariffs.  The changes in wage employment associated with tariff 
24:769:65318:23:22:64:528:581:133:Times:133:Times:declines are informative about changes in the return to education under strong assumptions. Assume 
24:770:65417:22:23:64:536:559:133:Times:133:Times:labor-supply is approximately linear and that its slope is positive and roughly the same for literate and 
24:771:65523:23:22:64:521:536:133:Times:133:Times:illiterate men. Tariffs might affect returns to education by differentially affecting labor demand for 
24:772:65626:22:23:64:534:514:133:Times:133:Times:literate workers and thereby the wage gap between literate and illiterate workers. Declining returns to 
24:773:65730:23:22:64:490:491:133:Times:133:Times:education with tariff declines (lower relative wages of the literate) would imply increases in 
24:774:65825:22:23:64:535:469:133:Times:133:Times:employment of illiterate men relative to the literate population. In fact, we observe the opposite in the 
24:775:65931:23:22:64:161:446:133:Times:133:Times:formal wage sector.  
24:776:65952:22:23:100:512:424:133:Times:133:Times:We estimate equation 7 separately for illiterate and literate adult males ages 25-50, using 
24:777:66044:23:22:64:540:401:133:Times:133:Times:participation in wage work and the number of days in wage work as dependent variables.30 The results 
24:778:66145:22:23:64:530:379:133:Times:133:Times:are reported in table 9 for illiterate (panel A) and literate (panel B) adult males.  Each column header 
24:779:66250:23:22:64:541:356:133:Times:133:Times:indicates the dependent variable.  Tariff declines are associated with increases in participation (column 
24:780:66356:22:23:64:533:334:133:Times:133:Times:1) and days worked (column 2) in wage work for literate men and declines in wage work for illiterate 
24:781:66457:23:22:64:530:311:133:Times:133:Times:men. Given the magnitudes of these estimates, the rise in days worked in wage work for literate men 
24:782:66557:22:23:64:497:289:133:Times:56:Times:reflects an increase in days in wage work beyond the rise in participation in the wage sector.31
24:783:66653:23:22:100:490:266:133:Times:133:Times:In sum, while our inference is limited by measurement issues, the expenditure, adult 
24:784:66738:22:22:64:546:244:133:Times:133:Times:employment, and school quality data are more supportive of increasing rather than decreasing returns to 
24:785:66842:22:23:64:546:222:133:Times:133:Times:education with tariff declines. Thus, we find little evidence that declines in the returns to education play 
24:786:66951:23:17:64:221:199:133:Times:133:Times:a substantive role in our findings. 
24:787:66987:17:12:547:550:182:144:Times:144:Times:                                                                                                                                                                  
24:788:67148:12:11:64:546:170:100:Times:100:Times:between rounds in this module that is a cause for concern if recall biases or purchase frequencies differ with literacy (or 
24:789:67272:11:12:64:541:159:100:Times:100:Times:primary school completion in columns 5 and 6). As a robustness check, we replicate our approach using the household 
24:790:67388:12:11:64:529:147:100:Times:100:Times:per capita expenditure reported in the Employment and Unemployment Schedule 10 of the NSS that does not suffer 
24:791:67499:11:7:64:220:136:100:Times:100:Times:from this problem in columns 3 and 4. 
24:792:67537:7:16:64:508:129:42:Times:100:Times:30 We use adult characteristics as controls (rather than child characteristics) and do not include controls for the 
24:793:67653:16:7:64:202:113:100:Times:100:Times:characteristics of household head. 
24:794:67688:7:16:64:547:106:42:Times:100:Times:31 At the mean tariff decline, estimates from panel B, column 1 of table 9, imply a 1.1 percentage point increase in wage 
24:795:67810:16:12:64:532:90:100:Times:100:Times:work. If days worked of existing wage workers did not change and all additional wage workers worked seven days a 
24:796:67923:12:11:64:550:78:100:Times:100:Times:week, we should observe an additional 0.08 days worked per week with the average tariff change in column 2 of table 9. 
24:797:68042:11:0:64:372:67:100:Times:100:Times:Instead, we observe an additional 0.13 days worked per week in wage work. 
25:798:68118:0:22:64:190:716:133:Times:133:Times:6.2 Child Labor Demand 
25:799:68141:22:23:64:537:694:133:Times:133:Times:If tariff declines are associated with a rise in the child’s economic contribution foregone by schooling, 
25:800:68247:23:22:64:547:671:133:Times:133:Times:w* in section 2, schooling could decline with tariffs. w* is the difference between the maximum income 
25:801:68350:22:23:64:538:649:133:Times:133:Times:the household can achieve when the child does not and does attend school. The economic contribution 
25:802:68450:23:22:64:537:626:133:Times:133:Times:foregone by schooling depends on the activities the child engages in, and we expect it to increase with 
25:803:68554:22:23:64:540:604:133:Times:133:Times:higher wages in the formal wage labor market or positive productivity shocks to the family business or 
25:804:68657:23:22:64:527:581:133:Times:133:Times:domestic production. We refer to the influence of w* on schooling as reflecting child labor demand. 
25:805:68757:22:23:64:520:559:133:Times:133:Times:This is somewhat imprecise but emphasizes that the channel is distinct from the marginal utility of 
25:806:68857:23:22:64:545:536:133:Times:133:Times:income. The evidence reviewed in this section provides little support for tariff declines being associated 
25:807:68964:22:23:64:295:514:133:Times:133:Times:with increased earnings opportunities of children. 
25:808:69015:23:22:100:509:491:133:Times:133:Times:Changes in the formal wage labor market are unlikely to be responsible for the observed 
25:809:69103:22:23:64:525:469:133:Times:133:Times:attenuation of schooling improvements with tariff declines. First, child employment in formal wage 
25:810:69202:23:22:64:514:446:133:Times:133:Times:sectors is infrequent. Second, child labor is typically modeled as a perfect substitute for unskilled 
25:811:69304:22:23:64:535:424:133:Times:133:Times:(illiterate) labor (Basu and Van 1998 for example), and we do not observe increases in the adult wage 
25:812:69406:23:22:64:541:401:133:Times:133:Times:sector employment for illiterates with tariff declines (table 9, panel A). Third, we examine the effect of 
25:813:69513:22:23:64:539:379:133:Times:133:Times:district tariffs on child’s participation in several work categories, based on a question in NSS about the 
25:814:69620:23:22:64:537:356:133:Times:133:Times:child’s principal usual activity (see section 3.1 for exact definitions). The findings from estimating (7) 
25:815:69727:22:23:64:359:334:133:Times:133:Times:for each work category as a dependent variable are in Table 10. 
25:816:69791:23:22:100:541:311:133:Times:133:Times:The data do not suggest that schooling declines are driven entirely by increased employment of 
25:817:69886:22:23:64:548:289:133:Times:133:Times:children in market work. Although tariff declines are associated with (statistically insignificant) increase 
25:818:69995:23:22:64:548:266:133:Times:133:Times:in the probability a child is observed working without attending school (column 3), this increase in work 
25:819:70101:22:22:64:541:244:133:Times:133:Times:is not in market work where the child's labor is likely to result in additional household income (column 
25:820:70206:22:23:64:526:222:133:Times:133:Times:4).  The increase in work is operating principally through domestic work (column 5). Moreover, the 
25:821:70305:23:22:64:541:199:133:Times:133:Times:declines in schooling and increases in work without schooling are largest for girls (panel C), and out of 
25:822:70411:22:23:64:526:177:133:Times:133:Times:school girls are less involved in cash-generating activities than out of school boys (The Probe Team 
25:823:70512:23:22:64:102:154:133:Times:133:Times:1999).   
25:824:70521:22:23:100:529:132:133:Times:133:Times:Rather, some of the declining school attendance with tariffs appears as increases in domestic 
25:825:70615:23:22:64:516:109:133:Times:133:Times:work (such as cooking, cleaning, gathering water and wood) and even larger increases in children 
25:826:70712:22:0:64:542:87:133:Times:133:Times:(especially boys) who do not report work as a principal usual activity and also do not attend school, i.e. 
26:827:70821:0:22:64:537:716:133:Times:133:Times:“idle” children. Child time in domestic work may indirectly increase household income either through 
26:828:70922:22:23:64:539:694:133:Times:133:Times:the goods produced in home production or complementarities of adult work in the formal labor market 
26:829:71022:23:22:64:530:671:133:Times:133:Times:and child domestic work (i.e. the child’s domestic work allows the adult to earn in the labor market). 
26:830:71125:22:23:64:534:649:133:Times:133:Times:Thus, domestic work can be an important component of the income foregone by schooling. However, 
26:831:71221:23:22:64:521:626:133:Times:133:Times:while tariff declines could bring nationwide productivity improvements in domestic work (through 
26:832:71318:22:23:64:534:604:133:Times:133:Times:cheaper inputs into domestic work that are complementary to child labor, for example), it is less clear 
26:833:71422:23:22:64:538:581:133:Times:133:Times:why these improvements should vary with district's employment exposure to tariff reforms. Moreover, 
26:834:71522:22:23:64:531:559:133:Times:133:Times:in unreported regressions we do not observe declines in domestic work among adults associated with 
26:835:71621:23:22:64:513:536:133:Times:133:Times:lower tariffs. Hence, it seems unlikely that the rise in domestic work reflect children filling in for 
26:836:71724:22:23:64:147:514:133:Times:133:Times:working parents.  
26:837:71742:23:22:100:523:491:133:Times:133:Times:The increased presence of idle children in districts with greater tariff declines might simply 
26:838:71837:22:23:64:516:469:133:Times:133:Times:reflect mismeasurement of child activities.  For example, some parents may not consider working 
26:839:71933:23:22:64:514:446:133:Times:133:Times:around the house a principal activity. However, there is an economic explanation. If the marginal 
26:840:72031:22:23:64:547:424:133:Times:133:Times:product of child’s labor in the various activities can become zero (or even negative), it can be optimal to 
26:841:72139:23:22:64:541:401:133:Times:133:Times:not use all the available child time for domestic or household enterprise work.32 In this case the child’s 
26:842:72246:22:23:64:547:379:133:Times:133:Times:net economic contribution, w*, could be zero. Yet, families might still be better off keeping children out 
26:843:72353:23:22:64:542:356:133:Times:133:Times:of school if the marginal utility from the returns to education falls short of the disutility associated with 
26:844:72463:22:23:64:541:334:133:Times:133:Times:schooling costs as discussed in Section 2. In fact, it is plausible that the increased incidence of children 
26:845:72572:23:22:64:543:311:133:Times:133:Times:in domestic work could reflect in part that domestic activities are a type of absorptive labor so that both 
26:846:72680:22:23:64:548:289:133:Times:133:Times:the increase in idleness and rise in domestic work with tariff declines reflects the avoidance of schooling 
26:847:72788:23:22:64:348:266:133:Times:133:Times:costs more than an actual economic contribution of the child. 
26:848:72850:22:22:100:537:244:133:Times:133:Times:The above evidence suggests that children are not withdrawing from school to improve family 
26:849:72942:22:23:64:535:222:133:Times:133:Times:incomes through bringing more cash to the household. We cannot exclude the possibility that a rise in 
26:850:73044:23:22:64:522:199:133:Times:133:Times:the child's potential economic contribution in domestic work lies behind a fraction of the schooling 
26:851:73145:22:23:64:534:177:133:Times:133:Times:results. However, the employment data are also consistent with the idea that the declines in schooling 
26:852:73248:23:64:64:540:154:133:Times:133:Times:are largely driven by the avoidance of the direct and indirect costs of schooling to which we now turn.  
26:853:73353:64:7:208:211:90:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
26:854:73401:7:16:64:533:83:42:Times:100:Times:32 This might occur in the presence of binding constraints on the availability of wage employment for children and if 
26:855:73519:16:0:64:499:67:100:Times:100:Times:home enterprise and domestic work production functions are positive concave in child time in each activity. 
27:856:73629:0:22:64:122:716:133:Times:133:Times:6.3 Poverty 
27:857:73641:22:23:64:533:694:133:Times:133:Times:If tariff declines are associated with increases in poverty (relative to national trends), schooling could 
27:858:73748:23:22:64:545:671:133:Times:133:Times:decline (relative to national trends) with tariff declines.  Topalova (2005) finds that districts which were 
27:859:73857:22:23:64:526:649:133:Times:133:Times:more exposed to trade reforms through employment experienced smaller poverty reduction than the 
27:860:73953:23:22:64:513:626:133:Times:133:Times:national average. We first replicate this analysis and find that in addition to poverty, it extends to 
27:861:74056:22:23:64:523:604:133:Times:133:Times:agricultural wages as well (a strong correlate of poverty). We then bring additional evidence which 
27:862:74156:23:22:64:531:581:133:Times:133:Times:suggests that schooling costs are at the core of the observed relationship between poverty, schooling, 
27:863:74259:22:23:64:142:559:133:Times:133:Times:and child labor.  
27:864:74277:23:22:100:544:536:133:Times:133:Times:Table 11 documents the relationship between employment weighted tariff declines and poverty. 
27:865:74370:22:23:64:546:514:133:Times:133:Times:Columns 1 and 2 replicate Topalova (2005) findings for rural areas by regressing a district level poverty 
27:866:74476:23:22:64:518:491:133:Times:133:Times:measure at time t ( headcount ratio in column 1 and poverty gap in column 2), on the employment 
27:867:74572:22:23:64:538:469:133:Times:133:Times:weighted tariff, district fixed effects, post-reform indicator, and the interaction of the initial conditions 
27:868:74682:23:22:64:538:446:133:Times:133:Times:in a district with the post-reform indicator. As usual, we instrument for district tariff with district tariff 
27:869:74793:22:23:64:537:424:133:Times:133:Times:on traded goods. For the district with the average change in trade exposure, the liberalization of tariffs 
27:870:74900:23:22:64:532:401:133:Times:133:Times:increases the headcount rate by 2.7 percentage points (nearly 10 percent) relative to a district with no 
27:871:75005:22:23:64:498:379:133:Times:133:Times:tariff change. Column 3 shows that declines in tariffs are associated with declines in wages of 
27:872:75101:23:22:64:523:356:133:Times:133:Times:agricultural workers, a high correlate of poverty (Burgess and Pande 2005, Duflo and Pande 2007). 
27:873:75199:22:23:64:506:334:133:Times:133:Times:Lower living standards may force families to pull children out of school if there are direct costs 
27:874:75298:23:22:64:482:311:133:Times:133:Times:associated with going to school or children are needed to contribute to the family income.  
27:875:75390:22:23:100:539:289:133:Times:133:Times:The responses of child labor and idleness to tariff declines discussed above suggest that saving 
27:876:75487:23:22:64:498:266:133:Times:133:Times:on schooling costs (rather than increasing child earnings in formal labor markets) is likely the 
27:877:75584:22:22:64:514:244:133:Times:133:Times:underlying link between tariffs and schooling. This is consistent with the Public Report On Basic 
27:878:75682:22:23:64:539:222:133:Times:133:Times:Education in India (1999) that found “schooling is too expensive” is the most frequently cited reason a 
27:879:75786:23:22:64:544:199:133:Times:133:Times:child was never enrolled in school and one of the two most cited reasons children were withdrawn from 
27:880:75888:22:23:64:515:177:133:Times:133:Times:school. This answer is plausible despite the fact that primary school tuition is theoretically free in 
27:881:75991:23:22:64:542:154:133:Times:133:Times:government run schools. Talik (2002) calculates that other direct costs including fees, books, uniforms, 
27:882:76096:22:23:64:515:132:133:Times:133:Times:tutoring, and transportation costs are about 7 percent of average annual income for families in the 
27:883:76196:23:0:64:532:109:133:Times:133:Times:poorest decile. Most of these costs need to be incurred in a short time window at the beginning of the 
28:884:76301:0:22:64:536:716:133:Times:133:Times:school year, and these cost estimates do not include the considerable indirect costs associated with the 
28:885:76406:22:23:64:384:694:133:Times:133:Times:child’s need to conform to the social norms of students in the school. 
28:886:76477:23:22:100:532:671:133:Times:133:Times:Below, we present some additional evidence consistent with this schooling costs explanation. 
28:887:76570:22:23:64:528:649:133:Times:133:Times:First, we observe that in districts with larger tariff declines, there is a relative increase in households 
28:888:76678:23:22:64:548:626:133:Times:133:Times:taking out loans to finance education and a decline in the amount spent on education. This evidence is in 
28:889:76784:22:23:64:528:604:133:Times:133:Times:Table 12, where we mimic our preferred specification (7). Even though school attendance trends are 
28:890:76883:23:22:64:546:581:133:Times:133:Times:attenuated in districts with larger tariff declines, we observe a higher incidence of households taking out 
28:891:76991:22:23:64:506:559:133:Times:133:Times:formal and informal loans for educational purposes in the more affected districts (column 1). In 
28:892:77088:23:22:64:498:536:133:Times:133:Times:addition, we observe that tariff declines are associated with declines in household educational 
28:893:77184:22:23:64:525:514:133:Times:133:Times:expenditure per capita (column 2), the log of household educational expenditure per capita plus one 
28:894:77284:23:22:64:546:491:133:Times:133:Times:(column 3), and the share of educational expenditure in the household budget (column 4). This evidence 
28:895:77387:22:23:64:511:469:133:Times:133:Times:corroborates the school attendance results and is consistent with the schooling costs argument as 
28:896:77485:23:22:64:358:446:133:Times:133:Times:households are spending less on education with tariff declines.  
28:897:77550:22:23:100:542:424:133:Times:133:Times:If the observed declines in school attendance reflect poverty induced saving on schooling costs, 
28:898:77647:23:22:64:526:401:133:Times:133:Times:one would expect tariff declines to be associated with smaller declines in school attendance in areas 
28:899:77749:22:23:64:528:379:133:Times:133:Times:where going to school is less costly. The 42nd and 52nd thin rounds of the NSS contain more detailed 
28:900:77850:23:22:64:520:356:133:Times:133:Times:information on education and schooling costs. In particular, using the 42nd round (1986) as our pre-
28:901:77950:22:23:64:535:334:133:Times:133:Times:reform period, we compute the prevalence of free tuition, the share of children obtaining free mid day 
28:902:78053:23:22:64:545:311:133:Times:133:Times:meals at school, and the share of children with scholarships in a district.33  We interact these pre-reform 
28:903:78161:22:23:64:550:289:133:Times:133:Times:aspects of school costs with district tariff and add it as a regressor in our main specification (7). Table 13 
28:904:78272:23:22:64:540:266:133:Times:133:Times:contains the results. We use school attendance and enrollment as our dependent variables in columns 1 
28:905:78374:22:22:64:543:244:133:Times:133:Times:and 2, respectively.34  Although not all interactions with schooling costs are statistically significant, the 
28:906:78484:22:23:64:525:222:133:Times:133:Times:negative signs of the coefficients suggest that declines in schooling relative to the national trend are 
28:907:78589:23:22:64:521:199:133:Times:133:Times:smaller in districts with smaller baseline schooling costs. That is, the greater the prevalence of free 
28:908:78693:22:23:64:527:177:133:Times:133:Times:midday meals (panel A), scholarships (panel B), or free tuitions (panel C), the smaller the decline in 
28:909:78796:23:22:64:534:154:133:Times:133:Times:schooling associated with the tariff changes. Of course, the above measures of the schooling costs are 
28:910:78899:22:19:64:463:132:133:Times:133:Times:non-random, but the evidence seems consistent with the importance of schooling cost. 
28:911:78984:19:7:208:211:113:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
28:912:79032:7:16:64:541:106:42:Times:100:Times:33 These are only three components of schooling costs. They do not capture the costs of clothing, books, materials, and 
28:913:79152:16:7:64:439:90:100:Times:100:Times:other aspects of “fitting in” at school which may be the most important parts of school costs.  
28:914:79248:7:16:64:524:83:42:Times:100:Times:34The 52nd round collects data on both school attendance in enrollment, while the 42nd round provides only data on 
28:915:79363:16:0:64:452:67:100:Times:100:Times:enrollment. In column 1, we assume that enrollment equals school attendance in the 42nd round.  
29:916:79461:0:22:100:528:716:133:Times:133:Times:In sum, tariff declines attenuate poverty reduction and agricultural wage gains relative to the 
29:917:79557:22:23:64:528:694:133:Times:133:Times:national trends. At the same time, we observe increases in child work (mainly driven by increases in 
29:918:79658:23:22:64:544:671:133:Times:133:Times:domestic work) that are smaller than the declines in schooling, and a rise in idleness. Tariff declines are 
29:919:79766:22:23:64:543:649:133:Times:133:Times:also associated with increases in educational loans and declines in education expenditure and education 
29:920:79870:23:22:64:546:626:133:Times:133:Times:expenditure as a share of household budget. These observations, coupled with suggestive heterogeneous 
29:921:79972:22:23:64:543:604:133:Times:133:Times:effect of tariffs on school attendance that vary with baseline schooling costs, point to schooling costs as 
29:922:80080:23:22:64:541:581:133:Times:133:Times:an important impediment to school attendance in times of slower (relative to trend) progress in poverty 
29:923:80184:22:23:64:124:559:133:Times:133:Times:alleviation.   
29:924:80199:23:22:64:320:536:133:Times:133:Times:6.4 Poverty Elasticity of Schooling and Child Labor 
29:925:80251:22:23:64:525:514:133:Times:133:Times:The results of the previous sections suggest that employment weighted tariff changes seem to affect 
29:926:80351:23:22:64:539:491:133:Times:133:Times:schooling primarily through their impact on poverty. In this section, we make a strong assumption that 
29:927:80454:22:23:64:531:469:133:Times:133:Times:the employment weighted traded tariffs affect schooling and child labor only through their impact on 
29:928:80555:23:22:64:516:446:133:Times:133:Times:local poverty rates. We then use the traded tariff as an instrument for poverty rates to estimate the 
29:929:80657:22:23:64:537:424:133:Times:133:Times:poverty elasticity of schooling and child labor. In particular, in a setting that parallels equation (7), we 
29:930:80766:23:22:64:519:401:133:Times:133:Times:regress schooling/child labor on a district poverty rate, our usual controls, and instrument for local 
29:931:80869:22:23:64:527:379:133:Times:133:Times:poverty with traded tariffs in a district.35 The exclusion restriction necessary for this exercise would 
29:932:80974:23:22:64:516:356:133:Times:133:Times:obviously be invalid if the traded tariff had an impact on returns to education or labor demand for 
29:933:81074:22:23:64:107:334:133:Times:133:Times:children. 
29:934:81084:23:22:100:510:311:133:Times:133:Times: Estimates of the poverty elasticity of schooling and child labor implied by this exclusion 
29:935:81175:22:23:64:539:289:133:Times:133:Times:restriction are in Table 14. In columns 1-6, we report results where the headcount ratio is instrumented 
29:936:81280:23:22:64:528:266:133:Times:133:Times:by the traded tariff; in the remaining columns, the poverty gap is instrumented with the traded tariff. 
29:937:81384:22:22:64:516:244:133:Times:133:Times:Column 1 implies that a 1 percentage point fall in the district's head count rate would increase the 
29:938:81485:22:23:64:539:222:133:Times:133:Times:probability that a child attends school by 0.7 percentage points. The same decline in the poverty rate is 
29:939:81591:23:22:64:537:199:133:Times:133:Times:associated with a 0.3 percentage points decline in the probability of a child working (column 2), albeit 
29:940:81696:22:23:64:537:177:133:Times:133:Times:this effect is imprecisely estimated. The small poverty elasticity of market work (column 4) relative to 
29:941:81801:23:22:64:535:154:133:Times:133:Times:the poverty elasticity of domestic work and idle status is consistent with our discussion above that the 
29:942:81906:22:30:64:481:132:133:Times:133:Times:tariff-schooling relationship is driven mostly by schooling costs rather than labor demand. 
29:943:81998:30:8:208:211:102:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
29:944:82046:8:16:64:543:94:42:Times:100:Times:35 These estimates are based on children in districts in states in which poverty lines are available. The results are robust 
29:945:82171:16:11:64:526:78:100:Times:100:Times:to including children in all states, with poverty lines assumed to be equal to neighboring states’ poverty lines when 
29:946:82289:11:0:64:100:67:100:Times:100:Times:missing. 
30:947:82300:0:22:100:542:716:133:Times:133:Times: There are some interesting gender differences in our estimates of the elasticity of schooling and 
30:948:82398:22:23:64:519:694:133:Times:133:Times:work with respect to poverty (Panel B and C). In general, both female schooling and work is more 
30:949:82495:23:22:64:539:671:133:Times:133:Times:sensitive to poverty than is male schooling and work. For boys, higher poverty is associated with more 
30:950:82598:22:23:64:531:649:133:Times:133:Times:market work, domestic work, and idle status. However, higher poverty is associated with less market 
30:951:82698:23:22:64:549:626:133:Times:133:Times:work and more domestic and idle status for girls. We suspect that these gender differences in the poverty 
30:952:82804:22:23:64:539:604:133:Times:133:Times:– market work relationship reflect something about the underlying status of girls in Indian households, 
30:953:82908:23:22:64:546:581:133:Times:133:Times:and a more thorough future study of gender work roles in India would be of interest. That said, the main 
30:954:83013:22:23:64:538:559:133:Times:133:Times:interesting finding for our study is that the response of girl's schooling and work to changes in poverty 
30:955:83119:23:22:64:253:536:133:Times:133:Times:appears to be nearly double that of boys. 
30:956:83161:22:23:100:536:514:133:Times:133:Times:If we take the pooled results (panel A) in Table 14 seriously, we can assess the role of poverty 
30:957:83258:23:22:64:537:491:133:Times:133:Times:declines in India's progress on schooling in the 1990s. Headcount poverty rates fell from 37 percent in 
30:958:83362:22:23:64:521:469:133:Times:133:Times:1987 to 24 percent in 1999 in rural India (Topalova 2005). Schooling increased from 55 percent of 
30:959:83460:23:22:64:537:446:133:Times:133:Times:children 10-14 to 73 percent (Table 1). The estimates from column 1 of Table 14 thus imply that more 
30:960:83561:22:23:64:548:424:133:Times:133:Times:than half of the increase in schooling in rural India in the 1990s can be explained by falling poverty. The 
30:961:83669:23:22:64:544:401:133:Times:133:Times:fraction of children working as a principal usual activity declined from 25 percent in 1987 to 14 percent 
30:962:83775:22:23:64:513:379:133:Times:133:Times:in 1999. Over one third of the decline in children who work without attending school can then be 
30:963:83872:23:22:64:549:356:133:Times:133:Times:explained by falling poverty (column 3). The lower poverty elasticity of work than schooling is perfectly 
30:964:83978:22:24:64:472:334:133:Times:133:Times:consistent with a theory that implies a greater income elasticity of schooling than work.  
30:965:84069:24:25:64:145:310:182:Times:182:Times:7. Conclusion 
30:966:84083:25:22:64:537:285:133:Times:133:Times:Much of the concern about trade liberalization focuses on the impact of the loss of protection on those 
30:967:84187:22:23:64:537:263:133:Times:133:Times:currently employed in protected industries. Our study considers whether these short and medium-term 
30:968:84287:23:22:64:545:240:133:Times:133:Times:adjustment costs of trade reform influence the schooling and work decisions of children.  Overall, in the 
30:969:84393:22:23:64:531:218:133:Times:133:Times:1990s, rural India experienced a dramatic increase in schooling and decline in child labor.  However, 
30:970:84495:23:22:64:528:195:133:Times:133:Times:rural districts where employment experienced larger changes in final product protection saw smaller 
30:971:84595:22:23:64:539:173:133:Times:133:Times:improvements in schooling and declines in child labor relative to the national trend. The attenuation in 
30:972:84700:23:22:64:515:150:133:Times:133:Times:schooling attendance trends associated with tariff declines is robust but not large in magnitude. A 
30:973:84800:22:23:64:539:128:133:Times:133:Times:district without any change in final product protection experiences a 17 percentage point improvement 
30:974:84902:23:22:64:511:105:133:Times:133:Times:in schooling rates for children 10-14 between 1987 and 2000. A district with the mean change in 
30:975:84998:22:0:64:399:83:133:Times:133:Times:protection experiences a 15 percentage point improvement in schooling. 
31:976:85071:0:22:100:549:716:133:Times:133:Times:The data suggest that the relationship between district exposure to trade reforms and schooling is 
31:977:85170:22:23:64:533:694:133:Times:133:Times:driven by the poverty impact of declining tariffs: districts subject to larger tariff declines experienced 
31:978:85277:23:22:64:533:671:133:Times:133:Times:slower poverty reduction. We do not find evidence of other obvious channels through which a loss of 
31:979:85377:22:23:64:533:649:133:Times:133:Times:final product protection might affect schooling such as through declines in the returns to education or 
31:980:85481:23:22:64:540:626:133:Times:133:Times:increases in child labor demand. Although we focus only on trade adjustment in this study, this finding 
31:981:85585:22:23:64:501:604:133:Times:133:Times:of a link between trade and child time allocation working primarily through living standards is 
31:982:85681:23:22:64:518:581:133:Times:133:Times:consistent with existing evidence from Vietnam's liberalization of rice export trade (Edmonds and 
31:983:85779:22:23:64:537:559:133:Times:133:Times:Pavcnik 2005) and the cross-country evidence on child labor and aggregate trade flows (Edmonds and 
31:984:85878:23:22:64:527:536:133:Times:133:Times:Pavcnik 2006).  In the present context, the negative elasticity of schooling with respect to poverty is 
31:985:85982:22:23:64:540:514:133:Times:133:Times:most likely due to the household’s inability to cover the costs associated with sending a child to school 
31:986:86088:23:22:64:521:491:133:Times:133:Times:in the absence of a well-functioning credit market. We have suggestive evidence that the impact of 
31:987:86187:22:23:64:547:469:133:Times:133:Times:tariffs on schooling is larger in areas with high baseline schooling costs and relative increases in poverty 
31:988:86296:23:22:64:549:446:133:Times:133:Times:are associated with a rise in the share of children who neither work nor attend school. Many studies have 
31:989:86402:22:23:64:513:424:133:Times:133:Times:emphasized schooling costs as a major impediment to schooling. However, to our knowledge the 
31:990:86495:23:22:64:527:401:133:Times:133:Times:important role schooling costs appear to play in explaining a strong poverty-schooling connection is 
31:991:86596:22:23:64:194:379:133:Times:133:Times:novel in observational data. 
31:992:86625:23:22:100:545:356:133:Times:133:Times:We cannot conclude from the strong empirical tariff – poverty – schooling connection that there 
31:993:86721:22:23:64:520:334:133:Times:133:Times:is no impact of tariff changes on other factors that influence schooling. It could be that the poverty 
31:994:86824:23:22:64:532:311:133:Times:133:Times:channel dwarfs these other channels in importance. However, if we assume that poverty is indeed the 
31:995:86924:22:23:64:535:289:133:Times:133:Times:only way through which the decline in final product protection influenced schooling in India, then the 
31:996:87027:23:22:64:497:266:133:Times:133:Times:resulting estimates of the poverty elasticity of schooling and child labor imply that half of the 
31:997:87125:22:22:64:524:244:133:Times:133:Times:improvement in schooling and a third of the decline in child labor in rural India in the 1990s can be 
31:998:87227:22:23:64:204:222:133:Times:133:Times:attributed to poverty declines. 
31:999:87259:23:22:100:534:199:133:Times:133:Times:It is important to emphasize that these estimated effects do not capture the first order effect of 
31:1000:87358:22:23:64:535:177:133:Times:133:Times:trade opening on school attendance; rather, they reflect differential changes in schooling in areas with 
31:1001:87463:23:22:64:520:154:133:Times:133:Times:more exposure to the tariff reform through their employment composition after controlling for any 
31:1002:87561:22:23:64:546:132:133:Times:133:Times:economy wide changes associated with trade liberalization or other economic factors. Our focus on how 
31:1003:87663:23:22:64:545:109:133:Times:133:Times:districts are affected by tariff changes through the composition of employment prior to reform follows a 
31:1004:87768:22:0:64:522:87:133:Times:133:Times:tradition within the trade literature. Trade liberalization brings a wide array of benefits to a country 
32:1005:87875:0:22:64:519:716:133:Times:133:Times:through lower consumption prices, lower input prices, opportunities for specialization, and greater 
32:1006:87975:22:23:64:511:694:133:Times:133:Times:competition. However, theory predicts adjustment costs associated with the loss of protection on

32:1008:88166:22:23:64:524:649:133:Times:133:Times:loosing protection permeate the literature. Our primary contribution to this literature is to show that 
32:1009:88270:23:22:64:534:626:133:Times:133:Times:these short term adjustment costs affect young cohorts through their impact on schooling, child labor, 
32:1010:88373:22:23:64:124:604:133:Times:133:Times:and literacy. 
32:1011:88387:23:22:100:516:581:133:Times:133:Times:How substantive are the observed changes in human capital? Our estimates imply that the 
32:1012:88475:22:23:64:546:559:133:Times:133:Times:average tariff decline is associated with a 2 percentage points decline in schooling attendance relative to 
32:1013:88583:23:22:64:526:536:133:Times:133:Times:the improvements in districts with no change in tariffs. This 2 percentage point decline in schooling 
32:1014:88685:22:23:64:531:514:133:Times:133:Times:attendance is associated with a 2 percentage point (relative) decline in literacy (figure 3). In the 1999 
32:1015:88791:23:22:64:500:491:133:Times:133:Times:data used in this study, rural families with a literate adult head have roughly 25 percent higher 
32:1016:88889:22:23:64:535:469:133:Times:133:Times:expenditures per person than families without a literate adult head. This is not a causal estimate of the 
32:1017:88995:23:22:64:533:446:133:Times:133:Times:impact of literacy on per capita expenditures.  We treat it as an upper bound on what the causal effect 
32:1018:89099:22:23:64:523:424:133:Times:133:Times:might be. Thus, the two percentage point decline in literacy is associated with at most a 2.5 percent 
32:1019:89201:23:22:64:541:401:133:Times:133:Times:decline in per capita expenditures per year. Assuming that the return to literacy is constant over the life 
32:1020:89309:22:23:64:539:379:133:Times:133:Times:cycle, the decline in literacy is permanent, individuals become household heads at age 20 and continue 
32:1021:89412:23:22:64:546:356:133:Times:133:Times:to age 64 (life expectancy in India), and a discount rate of 6 percent, lifetime per capita expenditures are 
32:1022:89521:22:23:64:527:334:133:Times:133:Times:at most 41 percent lower relative to an individual living in a community not facing these adjustment 
32:1023:89622:23:22:64:525:311:133:Times:133:Times:costs. This calculation does not imply that the affected individual's life time per capita expenditures 
32:1024:89726:22:23:64:535:289:133:Times:133:Times:would be 41 percent higher without the tariff reductions. Trade liberalization has likely contributed to 
32:1025:89831:23:22:64:522:266:133:Times:133:Times:the aggregate increases in schooling and literacy in India during our period of study. However, this 
32:1026:89932:22:22:64:529:244:133:Times:133:Times:calculation suggests that the asymmetric incidence of the costs of these tariff declines are potentially 
32:1027:90037:22:23:64:541:222:133:Times:133:Times:considerable for affected individuals, and our calculations neglect any additional transmission to future 
32:1028:90143:23:22:64:497:199:133:Times:133:Times:generations. Thus, policy attention to the consequences of trade adjustment for human capital 
32:1029:90237:22:23:64:204:177:133:Times:133:Times:accumulation seems merited.
