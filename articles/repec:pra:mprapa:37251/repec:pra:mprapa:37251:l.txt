2:17:550:21:21:106:524:627:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The main goal of this research was to investigate the SMEs competitiveness in terms 
2:18:634:21:21:70:524:606:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  leading  and  supporting  factors,  and  to  compare  the  influence  of  these  factors  on  SMEs 
2:19:737:21:20:70:524:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:performance. The study focused on four leading and four supportive factors. For each of these 
2:20:831:20:21:70:524:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors the respective indexes were constructed  and calculated on the basis of 300 Bulgarian 
2:21:925:21:21:70:524:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs.  Through  the  econometric  modelling  the  research  addressed  the  interaction  between 
2:22:1022:21:20:70:524:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:two groups of factors. The main findings related to the factors ordering - with some of leading 
2:23:1118:20:21:70:509:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors stepping back and supporting ones becoming more important in the times of crisis.

3:31:1573:11:12:70:72:749:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F: 
3:32:1573:12:14:99:524:737:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The   SMEs   competitiveness   depends   on   many   factors,   which   have   been   usually 
3:33:1667:14:14:70:524:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered  as  firms’  external,  internal,  and  related  to  entrepreneur  factors.  Following  the 
3:34:1770:14:14:70:524:709:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:concept of sustainable competitive advantages (Porter, 2004, p. 126) these factors could also 
3:35:1864:14:13:70:524:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:be  divided  into  two  other  groups.  The  first  group  includes  factors  for  achieving  sustainable 
3:36:1970:13:14:70:524:682:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitive  advantages  (leading  factors),  and  the  second  group  comprises  other  supporting 
3:37:2070:14:14:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors.  Leading  factors  are  contingent  to  the  economic  environment,  including  the  stage  of 
3:38:2174:14:14:70:524:654:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:country  development,  while  the  supporting  factors  are  more  invariable.  According  to  Porter, 
3:39:2277:14:14:70:524:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  most  important  condition  for  achieving  sustainable  advantages  is  the  firms’  continuous 
3:40:2379:14:13:70:524:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improvement and innovation (ibid, p. 123). This is because innovations lead to the creation of 
3:41:2474:13:14:70:524:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unique  brands,  technology,  marketing  channels,  etc.,  which  are  difficult  to  imitate.  In  the 
3:42:2578:14:14:70:524:599:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:present  global,  network  and  the  information  economy,  innovations  are  increasingly  linked 
3:43:2677:14:14:70:523:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with    ICT    applications,    international    quality    standards    implementation,    and    the 
3:44:2780:14:14:70:264:571:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:internationalization of firms’ activities.  
3:45:2824:14:13:99:524:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Sustainable   advantages,   however,   depend   on   other   factors   like   the   quality   of 
3:46:2921:13:14:70:524:544:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:institutions,  human  resources,  technological  capacity,  access  to  finance,  etc.,  which  form  the 
3:47:3027:14:14:70:524:530:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:group of supporting factors. As the literature review indicates, there has been limited research 
3:48:3124:14:14:70:524:516:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:on  the  SMEs  competitiveness  in  general,  and  on  these  two  groups  of  factors,  in  particular. 
3:49:3229:14:14:70:524:502:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:That  is  why  advancing  the  understanding  of  the  interaction  between  these  factors  under 
3:50:3328:14:13:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:different conditions (“normal” growth vs. crisis) will help entrepreneurs and policy makers by 
3:51:3423:13:14:70:478:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indicating context specific measures for the improvement of SMEs competitiveness.

3:55:3522:13:14:99:524:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Competitiveness  is  a  multidimensional  construct,  which  includes  a  combination  of 
3:56:3612:14:14:70:524:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors  (assets  and  processes)  that  determine  the  firm’s  performance.  A  framework  of 
3:57:3708:14:13:70:524:396:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:different competitiveness models is presented by Ambastha and Momaya (2004, p. 57), which 
3:58:3798:13:14:70:524:383:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is  however  difficult  to  operationalize  and  empirically  test.  Investigating  the  competitiveness 
3:59:3903:14:14:70:524:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  subcontracting  SMEs,  Lu et  al.  (2008)  propose  35  variables  grouped  in  eight  clusters. 
3:60:4004:14:14:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Using  Porter’s  framework,  Yan  (2010)  demonstrated  the  significance  of  competitiveness 
3:61:4099:14:14:70:524:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors   such   as   cost   reduction,   differentiation,   innovation,   strategic   alliances   and   the 
3:62:4208:14:13:70:523:327:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environment  for  Chinese  SMEs.  Szerb  and  Ulbert  (2009)  analysed  the  competitiveness  of 
3:63:4305:13:14:70:524:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Hungarian  SMEs  under  seven  pillars  (factors).  As  a rule,  global  competitiveness  indices 
3:64:4403:14:14:70:524:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Global  Competitiveness  Index,  World  Competitiveness  Yearbook,  Doing  Business,  etc.)  do 
3:65:4500:14:14:70:524:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not   refer   to   small   businesses.   The   Global   Entrepreneurship   Index   and   The   Global 
3:66:4602:14:14:70:524:272:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Entrepreneurship  and  Development  Index  (Acs  and  Szerb,  2010)  measure  the  level  of 
3:67:4695:14:13:70:524:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneurship,  and  not  the  SMEs  competitiveness.  These,  and  other  competitiveness 
3:68:4789:13:14:70:524:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:models, followed the traditional distinction of factors as external, internal, and related to the 
3:69:4887:14:14:70:523:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneurs,  without  distinguishing  between  most important  (leading)  and  supporting 
3:70:4980:14:14:70:109:217:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors. 
3:71:4989:14:14:99:524:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Greater attention was  given to leading factors in the literature on innovations,  ICT and 
3:72:5080:14:13:70:524:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quality  standards  implementation,  and  firms’  internationalization.  In  a  global  competitive 
3:73:5180:13:14:70:524:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environment, SMEs survival depends on firms’ innovation (Bilton and Cummings, 2010), and 
3:74:5269:14:14:70:524:162:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:there is evidence that innovative SMEs grew faster in comparison to the rest (Rosenbusch et 
3:75:5361:14:14:70:524:148:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:al.,  2010).  Raisch et  al.  (2009)  demonstrated  that  companies  with  sustainable  competitive 
3:76:5461:14:14:70:524:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:advantages maintained two types of innovations - exploration and exploitation (organisational 
3:77:5555:14:13:70:523:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ambidexterity). The supporting factors for the firm’s innovation are internal, such as strategy, 
3:78:5652:13:14:70:524:107:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human capital, and intra-firm training; external, such as industry sector, regulations, access to 
3:79:5750:14:14:70:524:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finance (Galankis, 2006, p. 1231); and linked to the entrepreneur’s characteristics - learning, 
3:80:5846:14:0:70:298:79:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market orientation, etc. (Masurel et al., 2003).  
4:81:5897:0:14:99:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A substantial literature was devoted to the ICT and e-commerce adoption by SMEs as a 
4:82:5982:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:key to growth (Simpson and Docherty, 2004). There are several theoretical models to research 
4:83:6075:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  IT  adoption  in  SMEs  (Ramdani  and  Kawalek,  2007,  p.  55),  and  researchers  use 
4:84:6168:14:13:70:523:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:combinations  of  these  models.  The  implementation  of  international  quality  standards  is  also 
4:85:6271:13:14:70:524:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:crucial  for SMEs  as it contributes to overcoming some market failures (Knut, 2004, p. 327). 
4:86:6365:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Today  SMEs  are  under  a  growing  pressure  from  their major  clients  to  certify  in  order  to 
4:87:6467:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:continue  to  work  with  them  (Baumol,  2009).  Creation  of  own  trademarks  and  brands  is 
4:88:6564:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:another  way  for  SMEs  to  move  higher  on  the  value  added  chain  (Humphrey  and  Shmitz, 
4:89:6661:14:13:70:524:649:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2002) As the ICT and quality standards acceptance, and the creation of own trademarks are a 
4:90:6753:13:14:70:524:636:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:form of innovations, the factors influencing their application in SMEs are similar to those for 
4:91:6849:14:14:70:524:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation in general. Many researchers have revealed also the growing significance of “early 
4:92:6943:14:14:70:524:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:internationalized”  or  “born  global”  firms  (Rialp et  al.,  2005).  Internationalization  could  be 
4:93:7047:14:14:70:524:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered  also  as  a  kind  of  innovation,  which  explains  the  similarity  of  factors  for  two 
4:94:7151:14:13:70:503:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:processes (Ruzzier et al., 2007; Jansson and Sandberg, 2008; Williams and Shaw, 2011).  
4:95:7239:13:14:99:523:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Amongst  supporting  factors,  the  institutional  environment  has  attracted  attention. 
4:96:7330:14:14:70:524:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Institutional  analyses  of  SMEs  development  reveal  the  advantages  of  strong  institutions  and 
4:97:7433:14:14:70:524:539:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  disadvantages  of  weak  ones  (Xheneti  and  Smallbone,  2008).  The  inefficiency  of  formal 
4:98:7534:14:14:70:524:525:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:institutions  leads  to  the  creation  of  non-productive,  rent-seeking  entrepreneurs  (Desai et  al., 
4:99:7640:14:13:70:524:511:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2010). The institutional analysis of SMEs, however, occasionally makes connections to other 
4:100:7732:13:14:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitiveness  factors.  SMEs  access  to  finance  is the  other  important  factor.  It  has  been 
4:101:7835:14:14:70:524:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:discussed  under  potential  market  failures  due  to  information  asymmetries  (Shane  and  Cable, 
4:102:7937:14:14:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2002) and reputation concerns (Kon and Storey, 2003), but often without connections to other 
4:103:8030:14:14:70:524:456:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitiveness  factors.  The  increasing  globalization  of  business  raises  the  significance  of 
4:104:8133:14:13:70:524:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:strategic management (Smith and Tushman, 2005), which is also rarely included in the SMEs

4:106:8329:14:14:70:426:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Wang et al., 2010) and human capital development (Smith, 2000, p. 89). 
4:107:8401:14:14:99:524:401:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In  summary,  few  models  seeking  to  explain  the  SMEs competitiveness  have  relied  on 
4:108:8494:14:14:70:524:387:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  general  framework  of  firms’  internal  and  external  factors.  Besides,  the  significance  of 
4:109:8598:14:13:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these  factors  was  analyzed  mostly  under  conditions of  “normal”  economic  development  or 
4:110:8695:13:14:70:427:360:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth, neglecting periods of unstable economic development and crisis.  
4:111:8768:14:14:99:524:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Based  on  the  literature  review  and  the  particular  national  context,  the  following 
4:112:8861:14:14:70:524:332:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:research    questions    were    investigated:    Which    are    the    key    factors    of    the    SMEs 
4:113:8970:14:14:70:524:318:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitiveness? Can we distinguish between the most important (context leading) and other 
4:114:9061:14:13:70:524:304:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(supporting)  factors  for  the  SMEs  competitiveness? How  do  these  two  groups  of  factors 
4:115:9158:13:14:70:524:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influence  the  SMEs  performance  by  interacting  with each  other?  The main  hypotheses  were 
4:116:9256:14:14:70:141:277:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the following: 
4:117:9271:14:14:99:502:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H1. The higher level of innovation activity accounts for higher SMEs performance. 
4:118:9353:14:13:99:501:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H2. The SMEs internationalization impacts positively their economic performance. 
4:119:9434:13:14:99:492:236:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H3. SMEs with own trademarks and patents excel higher economic performance. 
4:120:9510:14:14:99:488:222:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H4. SMEs with implemented quality standards demonstrate better performance.  
4:121:9587:14:14:99:524:208:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H5.  Better  access  to  finance  contributes  significantly  and  positively  to  higher  level  of 
4:122:9688:14:14:70:524:194:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation,  internationalization,  trade  mark  and  patents  registration,  quality  standards  and 
4:123:9790:14:13:70:260:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ICT adoption, and firms’ performance. 
4:124:9828:13:14:99:524:167:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H6. Good management  practices (ICT and e-business adoption, staff training, strategic 
4:125:9915:14:14:70:524:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:planning  and  marketing,  etc.)  lead  to  higher  level of  innovation,  internationalization,  trade 
4:126:10019:14:14:70:511:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mark and patents registration, quality standards and ICT adoption, and firms’ performance. 
4:127:10110:14:14:99:524:125:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H7.  The  SMEs  size  positively  impacts  innovation,  internationalization,  intellectual 
4:128:10202:14:13:70:458:111:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:property activities, quality standards and ICT adoption, and firms’ performance. 
4:129:10283:13:14:99:524:98:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:H8. Export oriented SMEs develop a higher degree of innovation, intellectual property 
4:130:10369:14:0:70:514:84:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:activities, internationalization, quality standards and ICT adoption, and firms’ performance.

5:133:10484:12:14:99:524:737:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The main goal of this research was to reveal the SMEs competitiveness factors in terms 
5:134:10571:14:14:70:523:723:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  context  specific  (leading)  and  supporting  factors.  Precisely,  the  goal  was  to  establish  to 
5:135:10678:14:14:70:524:709:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:what degree, and in which ways, these two groups of factors influence the SMEs performance 
5:136:10769:14:13:70:524:695:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:under  crisis  economic  conditions.  The  measures  of  competitiveness  ranged  from  simple 
5:137:10864:13:14:70:524:682:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indicators  to  complex  indexes  (Buzzigoli  and  Viviani,  2009).  The  situation  with  Bulgarian 
5:138:10965:14:14:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs was analyzed through the prism of 8 key factors. Five of these factors were compound 
5:139:11055:14:14:70:524:654:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:variables,   represented   by   indexes:   (1)   innovations;   (2)   internationalization;   (3)   own 
5:140:11159:14:14:70:523:640:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:trademarks and patents; (4) access to finance; and (5) good management practices. The other 
5:141:11251:14:13:70:524:626:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:three factors were implemented quality standards, export orientation, and size. Following the 
5:142:11345:13:14:70:524:613:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Porter  idea  about  two  types  of  competitive  advantages,  the  factors  were  separated  into  two 
5:143:11449:14:14:70:524:599:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:groups.  The  first  group  included  factors  for  achieving  sustainable  competitive  advantages 
5:144:11549:14:14:70:524:585:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(leading factors), while the second group contained supporting factors. Here we included the 
5:145:11642:14:14:70:524:571:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ICT  and  e-business  adoption  factor  in  “good  management  practices”,  and  not  as  separate 
5:146:11741:14:10:70:444:557:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:leading factor. These groups of factors formed the conceptual model (Fig. 1).

5:170:12268:12:14:99:524:366:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Based on the conceptual model, a standardized questionnaire was created and duly filled 
5:171:12356:14:14:70:524:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in  by  300  SMEs  managers  with  the  help  of  interviewers  in  February  2011.  The  sample 
5:172:12453:14:14:70:524:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:included  SMEs  from  manufacturing  (13%),  services  (40%),  construction  (6%),  and  trade 
5:173:12548:14:14:70:524:324:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(41%).  Among  them  89%  were  micro,  9%  small,  and  2% medium  sized  by  number  of 
5:174:12638:14:13:70:524:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:employees.  12%  were  from  the  capital,  76%  -  from  district  and  10%  from  small  cities,  and

6:234:17557:14:13:70:524:194:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supporting factors, as well as for other characteristics like size of settlement, gender, age and

6:241:17973:13:14:99:524:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In  80%  of  the  SMEs  the  innovation  activity  was weak,  in  11%  - rather  weak;  5%  had 
6:242:18069:14:13:70:524:88:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:neither  weak,  nor  advanced;  3%  - rather  advanced;  and  only  a  negligible  1%  had advanced 
6:243:18169:13:0:70:523:75:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation  activity.  The  innovation  activity  in  the  medium-sized  enterprises  was  over  three 
7:244:18273:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:times higher, and in the  small firms -  almost twice higher than in the micro-enterprises. The 
7:245:18369:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mostly innovative companies were from the manufacturing, while least innovative were in the 
7:246:18461:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:trade.  As  other  researchers  have  shown,  the  SMEs  sector  still  suffered  of  the  innovation 
7:247:18563:14:13:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:management  deficit  (O’Regan et  al.,  2005).  The  significant  factors  for  the  SMEs  innovation 
7:248:18665:13:14:70:524:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were:  size,  average  age  of  the  equipment,  entrepreneur’s  education,  access  for  finance.  The 
7:249:18769:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation activity increased with the company size by number of employees (Fig. 2); it was 
7:250:18861:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:greater in enterprises with newer equipment and vice versa; it was positively associated with 
7:251:18955:14:14:70:522:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the level of the entrepreneur’s education; and it augmented with the lighten access to finance.

7:266:19211:14:14:70:524:461:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovations  (Cosh  and  Hughes,  2000;  Masurel et  al.,  2003;  Migdadi,  2009;  Omerzel  and

7:268:19403:14:14:70:524:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:appropriate sources  for financing  was the most embarrassing factor for innovations (Applied

7:270:19595:13:14:70:524:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs  maintained  their  own  library  of  professional  literature,  and  roughly  1/5  had  provided 
7:271:19698:14:14:70:524:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their  employees  training  in  innovation.  However,  only  10%  had  sufficient  funds  to  finance 
7:272:19800:14:14:70:523:378:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation  activities.  This  explains  the  observation  that  barely  3%  of  the  SMEs  had  a  R&D 
7:273:19904:14:14:70:524:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unit  and  personnel  responsible  for  such  activity.  The  cooperation  with  scientific  institutes, 
7:274:20009:14:13:70:524:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:universities  and  academia  was  also  limited  -  4%  of the  SMEs  have  used  scientific  research, 
7:275:20113:13:14:70:524:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and approximately 10% have collaborated with universities. The insufficient partnership with 
7:276:20206:14:14:70:524:323:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:research  organisations  obviously  had  a  negative  effect  on  the  innovation  scores  of  the 
7:277:20305:14:14:70:356:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:researched SMEs (Doloreux, 2004; Hewitt-Dundas, 2006). 
7:278:20360:14:14:99:524:295:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  worsened  access  to  finance  expressed  in  the  fact,  that  in  2010  only13%  of  SMEs 
7:279:20457:14:13:70:523:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:declared   that   they   developed   and   promoted   new   product   on   market;   16%   improved 
7:280:20557:13:14:70:524:268:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considerably already existing products, and 9% were developing new one to be launch on the 
7:281:20648:14:14:70:524:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market soon. The other researchers have  also outlined that most often the SMEs innovations 
7:282:20740:14:14:70:524:240:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  in  products  in  spite  that  they  went  out  together  with  process  oriented  ones  (Bala

7:284:20939:14:13:70:524:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:outdated   (Corrocher et   al.,   2009)   as   in   our   case.   As   a   whole,   the   ability   of   SMEs 
7:285:21049:13:14:70:523:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovativeness  varies  significantly  in  function  of their  size,  available  resources,  industry 
7:286:21151:14:14:70:367:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sector, and business environment (Burrone and Jaiya, 2005).

7:289:21408:14:13:70:524:143:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Romania) felt in the last group with a level of innovation quite below the EU-27 average (EC

7:291:21607:14:14:70:524:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:on some indicators, related to human resources, while the weaknesses were mainly in respect 
7:292:21699:14:14:70:469:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to entrepreneurs’ innovation activities, intellectual assets, and patents (Ibid, p. 25).

8:314:22538:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these markets. There was some activity in terms  of participation in  exhibitions and fairs, the 
8:315:22635:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:most  frequently  visited  ones  were  abroad  -  almost  20%  of  SMEs  managers  stated  that  they 
8:316:22737:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:participated in such exhibitions. The SMEs managers had participated in other events too, like

8:318:22938:13:14:70:524:636:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was still relatively low. Participation of SMEs in clusters affected few of the firms – only 4%. 
8:319:23035:14:14:70:524:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The interviewed owners/managers indicated that most frequently performed cluster activities 
8:320:23127:14:14:70:524:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  training,  innovation  and  public  private  partnerships.  The  most  recognized  benefit  from 
8:321:23230:14:14:70:320:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:participation in a cluster was finding new partners.  
8:322:23284:14:13:99:524:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:A:According  to  the  values  of  the  internationalization  index,  95%  of  the  SMEs  had  a low 
8:323:23382:13:14:70:524:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:degree;  the  remaining  5%  had rather  low or neither  low,  nor  high degree.  Companies  with 
8:324:23480:14:14:70:524:553:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:rather  high and high degree  of  internationalization  were  observed  only  occasionally.  Most 
8:325:23578:14:14:70:524:539:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:internationalized were medium-sized enterprises - more than twice than the micro- and small 
8:326:23670:14:10:70:294:525:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:firms (Fig. 3), and those from manufacturing.

8:341:23796:14:13:99:524:327:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  other  researches  on  the  SMEs  internationalization  also  suggested  that  those  from 
8:342:23892:13:14:70:524:314:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  manufacturing  were  most  active  in  comparison  with  trade  firms  (Matlay  and  Fletcher, 
8:343:23992:14:14:70:524:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2000, p. 442). Other factors with significant influence on the SMEs internationalization were 
8:344:24086:14:14:70:524:286:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:company  size  and  innovation  activities.  The  level  of  internationalization  increased  with the 
8:345:24189:14:14:70:524:272:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:number  of  employees,  as  well  as  with  the  degree  of innovations.  Obviously  the  small  size 
8:346:24291:14:13:70:524:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:continues to hamper the SMEs internationalization, mainly because of insufficient resources. 
8:347:24384:13:14:70:524:245:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The small business often have no strategy for going on the external market, and consequently 
8:348:24477:14:14:70:524:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their internationalization seems accidental (Westhead et al., 2002). The present data confirms 
8:349:24572:14:14:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the   related   with   the   innovation   model,   according   which   each   consecutive   stage   of 
8:350:24675:14:14:70:524:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:internationalization is regarded as a kind of innovation (Gankema et al., 2000). These stages 
8:351:24769:14:13:70:524:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(innovations) are easier to accomplish in new created small firms, as they have not inherited 
8:352:24863:13:14:70:326:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:routine administrative practices (Autio et al., 2000).  
8:353:24919:14:14:99:523:162:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Humphrey  and  Shmitz  (2002)  demonstrated  that  SMEs  could  be  more  successful  by 
8:354:25008:14:14:70:524:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:developing  higher  quality  or  creating  their own  brands  and  trade  marks.  This  is  a  difficult 
8:355:25113:14:14:70:524:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:task in the extremely  competitive EU market.  In 2010 only 8% of the Bulgarian SMEs have 
8:356:25203:14:13:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:registered  trademark  in  the  country,  and  2%  -  abroad.  Regarding  patents,  these  registrations 
8:357:25308:13:14:70:524:107:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  4%  and  1%  respectively.  The  share  of  forthcoming  registrations  of  trademarks  and 
8:358:25406:14:14:70:524:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:patents  was  also  insignificant.  A  very  low  level  of  awareness  of  the  value  of  the  intellectual 
8:359:25516:14:0:70:477:79:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:property, as well as of the possibilities for registering such in the EU was observed.

9:376:25684:0:14:99:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The values of the own trade marks and patents index showed that 94% of the Bulgarian 
9:377:25769:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs had low level in these activities; 4% - rather low; and 2% - average level. There were 
9:378:25861:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only  isolated  cases  of advanced patent  activity.  This  situation  can  be  explained  by  the 
9:379:25960:14:13:70:523:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:insufficient  financial  resources  -  only  7%  of  the  firms  had  enough  money  for  registration  of 
9:380:26067:13:14:70:524:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:trademark,  and  5%  -  for  patent  registration.  The  patent  activity  was  most  developed  among 
9:381:26170:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  small  enterprises  where  it  was  almost  twice  higher  than  in  the  micro-enterprises.  The 
9:382:26273:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fields  of  manufacturing  and  trade  were  most  developed  in  terms  of  patent  registration.  The 
9:383:26377:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:significant  factors  for  these  activities  were: company  size;  innovation  activity;  and  good 
9:384:26478:14:13:70:523:649:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:management  practices.  The  patent  activity  increased  with  the  company  size;  firms  with  the 
9:385:26580:13:14:70:524:636:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:higher level of innovation were more active in the intellectual property development; greater 
9:386:26674:14:14:70:523:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:application of good management practices was positively related with firm’s patent activities. 
9:387:26769:14:14:99:524:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In early  2011, the  access to finance was very difficult for 93%  of the  enterprises. Only 
9:388:26862:14:14:70:524:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:6%  have rather  difficult access,  and  1%  - neither  difficult,  nor  easy.  These  findings 
9:389:26958:14:13:70:524:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:correspond  to  the  ECB  data  for  2009-2010,  which  reported  the  deterioration  of  access  to 
9:390:27059:13:14:70:523:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finance  for  all  SMEs  in  the  EU  (ECB,  2010).  The  biggest  difficulties  in  financing  were 
9:391:27160:14:14:70:524:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:observed in the micro-enterprises, where the average index values were two times lower than 
9:392:27252:14:14:70:524:539:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the medium-sized enterprises. Businesses in manufacturing and construction had relatively 
9:393:27345:14:14:70:524:525:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:easier access to finance - higher than the average for the economy. The services had the worst 
9:394:27440:14:13:70:524:511:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:position in getting funding. The main and the only significant factor influencing the access to 
9:395:27536:13:14:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finance  was  the enterprise  size.  The  larger  the  enterprise,  the  easier  the  funding  it  gets 
9:396:27640:14:14:70:524:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(p<0.05). Not only in Bulgaria, but everywhere the banks grant credits to smaller enterprises 
9:397:27734:14:14:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:under  a  higher  interest  rate  and  a  greater  guarantee,  which  is  due  to  the  higher  information 
9:398:27842:14:14:70:523:456:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:asymmetry.  Because  of  that  the  small  business  prefer  using  internal  funds  to  external 
9:399:27940:14:13:70:524:442:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:financing  (Klapper  et  al.,  2006).  In  2010,  the  most  common  sources  of  funding  were  the 
9:400:28041:13:14:70:524:429:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:resources of the owner (42%), loans from friends and relatives (17%) and bank loans (14% of 
9:401:28133:14:14:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the SMEs have investment loans and loans for working capital). Venture capital was used by 
9:402:28224:14:14:70:208:401:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a small share of businesses.  
9:403:28254:14:14:99:524:387:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:At the same time instalments on bank loans for working capital and loans from relatives 
9:404:28342:14:13:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  friends  have  been  paid  with  the  highest  difficulties.  10%  of  the  SMEs  had  overdue 
9:405:28442:13:14:70:524:360:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payments, and 32% had been late in paying their obligations last year. There was also a delay 
9:406:28536:14:14:70:523:346:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in  payments  received  from  customers  during  the  previous  year:  55%  of  the  SMEs  have 
9:407:28632:14:14:70:524:332:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:encountered  this  problem,  and  15%  have  been  expecting  their  revenues  on  average  over  91 
9:408:28733:14:14:70:524:318:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:days. The difficult access to finance was also related to the limited investments made last year 
9:409:28830:14:13:70:524:304:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:-  about  1/3  of  the  enterprises  have  bought  new  equipment  (35%);  30%  invested  in  staff 
9:410:28930:13:14:70:524:291:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:training and advertising, 22% - in development of new or improving the existing products, 9% 
9:411:29023:14:14:70:493:277:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:introduced management information systems, and 4% invested in intellectual property.  
9:412:29109:14:14:99:524:263:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The good management practices revealed that the most widespread was the application 
9:413:29193:14:13:70:524:249:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  internet  technologies:  37%  of  SMEs  had  a  website,  and  27%  -  electronic  signature.  The 
9:414:29296:13:14:70:524:236:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:share  of  SMEs  applying  information  management  systems  was  small  (less  than  6%).  The 
9:415:29392:14:14:70:524:222:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:training of the personnel was not a part of the everyday life of most SMEs, but was relatively 
9:416:29487:14:14:70:524:208:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:developed - 37% of companies have applied internal and 17% external staff training. 69% of 
9:417:29578:14:14:70:524:194:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs had short term planning, 16% - medium term, and only 3% - long term planning. One 
9:418:29665:14:13:70:524:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:third of enterprises have developed marketing strategies, but only 17% have done marketing 
9:419:29756:13:14:70:388:167:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:surveys in domestic, and 4% - in foreign markets in the last year.  
9:420:29824:14:14:99:524:153:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The values of the index for good management practices showed a certain uptake - 45% 
9:421:29908:14:14:70:524:139:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  the  firms  occupied low or rather  low level,  while  10%  applied  such  practices  to  a  more 
9:422:30010:14:14:70:524:125:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considerable  extent.  However,  still  no  SMEs  developed  these  practices  in high degree.  The 
9:423:30110:14:13:70:524:111:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:application  of  good  management  practices  in  the  medium-sized  enterprises  was  twice  higher

10:430:30512:14:14:70:524:534:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was  in  line  with  data  from  other  researches  (Zhu et  al.,  2006;  Love et  al.,  2005;  Zhu  and 
10:431:30617:14:13:70:523:520:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Kraemer, 2005; Oliveira and Martins, 2010, Lin and Lin, 2008), which could be explained by 
10:432:30708:13:14:70:524:507:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  specificity  of  products/services  (Dinlersoz  and  Pereira,  2007).  Other  significant  factors 
10:433:30812:14:14:70:524:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:were related to: enterprise size; type of settlement; average age of both the employees and the 
10:434:30908:14:14:70:524:479:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:company;  age,  education,  and  gender  of  entrepreneurs;  and  innovation  activities.  The 
10:435:31003:14:14:70:524:465:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:adoption  of  good  management  practices  increased  with  the  company  size.  This  result 
10:436:31097:14:13:70:524:451:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:confirmed the positive relation between company size and the level of the ICT use (Baldwin 
10:437:31188:13:14:70:524:438:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:et  al.,  2004;  Fabiani et  al.,  2005;  Hsu et  al.,  2006;  Pan  and Jang,  2008),  which  is  due  to the 
10:438:31298:14:14:70:524:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:greater  financial  (Hwang et  al.,  2004)  and  human  resources  (Morgan et  al.,  2006).  Smaller 
10:439:31399:14:14:70:524:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:companies  operate  usually  in  niches,  where  the  benefits  of  new  technologies  might  be  not 
10:440:31501:14:14:70:524:396:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:evident  (Pontikakis et  al.,  2006),  and  they  faced  higher  risks  in  the  ICT  implementation 
10:441:31602:14:13:70:524:382:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Bruque  and  Moyano,  2007).  Besides,  the  information  management  in  SMEs  is  relatively 
10:442:31698:13:14:70:524:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:simple, and because of that it attracts fewer resources (Ramdani and Kawalek, 2007, p. 49). In 
10:443:31793:14:14:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:line with other findings, these practices are more developed in SMEs situated in bigger cities 
10:444:31888:14:14:70:481:341:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and less developed in smaller settlements (Forman, Goldfarb and Greenstein, 2008).  
10:445:31972:14:14:98:523:327:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  application  of  good  management  practices  was  higher  in  companies  with  smaller 
10:446:32065:14:13:70:524:313:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:average age of employees and vice versa. The adult employees, who have accustomed to old 
10:447:32154:13:14:70:524:300:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:practices,  and  who  have  greater  difficulties  in  acquiring  new  skills,  may  hamper  the 
10:448:32251:14:14:70:524:286:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:introduction  of  the  new  ICT  applications  (Beatty et  al.,  2001;  Scupola,  2003;  Fabiani et  al., 
10:449:32357:14:14:70:524:272:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2005).  The  development  of  good  management  practices   augmented  with  the  level  of 
10:450:32449:14:14:70:524:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneurs’ education and  age, which underlies the key  role of owner/manager of a small 
10:451:32542:14:13:70:523:244:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:firm  for  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  (Matlay  and  Fletcher,  2000;  Culkin  and  Smith, 
10:452:32643:13:14:70:524:231:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2000).  The  higher  level  of  the  company  innovativeness  was  positively  related  to  the 
10:453:32739:14:14:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:application of good management practices, which was found in other researches too (Bao and 
10:454:32830:14:14:70:524:203:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Sun,  2010,  p.  173;  Wang  and  Cheung,  2004).  The  present  data  revealed  that  women 
10:455:32923:14:14:70:502:189:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:entrepreneurs in Bulgaria applied good management practices to higher degree than men. 
10:456:33010:14:13:98:524:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:On the basis of the estimated econometric models, the significant driving forces for the 
10:457:33099:13:14:70:526:162:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:SMEs   performance   under   crisis   were   identified   (Fig.   5).   According   to   the   illustrated 
10:458:33206:14:14:70:523:148:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:configuration,  innovations  had  indirect positive  impact  on  the  SMEs  performance  within  a 
10:459:33305:14:14:70:524:134:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:transmission  mechanism  of  good  management  practices  (H1).  It  turned  out  that  in  crisis 
10:460:33404:14:14:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:conditions the competitive advantages of innovations still matter (to some extent), but affect 
10:461:33499:14:13:70:524:106:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:form’s  performance  through  the  accumulated  by  good management  practices  human  capital. 
10:462:33595:13:14:70:524:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Thus the medium-sized and micro enterprises with a higher index of innovativeness had made 
10:463:33686:14:0:70:524:79:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:layoffs in 2010, while the enterprises of the same sizes with a lower innovativeness index had

11:479:33958:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hit  differently  by  the  crisis.  For  instance  more  innovative  SMEs  in  manufacturing  have 
11:480:34057:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:released  employees  in  comparison  with  less  innovative  ones,  while  the  situation  in  the 
11:481:34156:14:10:70:273:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:construction sector was just the opposite.

11:490:34403:13:14:70:523:312:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:indirect through  its  effect  on  the  intellectual  property  activities  and  therefore  through  good 
11:491:34509:14:14:70:524:298:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:management practices (H2). This could be due again to sector specific conditions, as the crisis 
11:492:34605:14:14:70:524:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:affected  both  internationalized  and  domestic  oriented  enterprises.  On  the  one  hand,  the 
11:493:34704:14:14:70:523:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:enterprises,  whose  turnovers  had  not  suffered  in  the  crisis,  were  more  internationalized.  On 
11:494:34809:14:13:70:524:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  other  hand,  firms  which  had  experienced  personnel  cuts  were  more  internationalized.

11:500:35340:13:14:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:management practices (H3). In 2010 enterprises with a higher index of patent and trademark 
11:501:35431:14:14:70:524:160:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:activity  (from  all  sectors  and  size  groups)  had  experienced  labour  force  contractions,  while 
11:502:35536:14:14:70:524:146:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:those  with  a  lower  index  had  retained  their  employment.  SMEs  with  implemented  quality 
11:503:35634:14:14:70:524:132:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:standards  were  more  innovative  and  more  internationalized.  This  factor  had  also  a  positive, 
11:504:35738:14:13:70:364:118:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:but quite indirect influence on the SMEs performance (H4).  
11:505:35798:13:14:99:524:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Thus the first four hypotheses received only partial support. The impact of four leading

11:507:35982:14:0:70:384:77:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitiveness, turned to be positive, but more or less indirect.

12:562:37591:0:14:99:523:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The access to finance has affected directly the SMEs performance (H5). The enterprises 
12:563:37678:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with better access to financing have released less number of employees or haven’t done it at 
12:564:37771:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:all.  On  the  contrary,  enterprises  from  all  sectors with  a  lower  index  of  access  to  financing 
12:565:37878:14:13:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have  made  layoffs.  The  limited  access  to  finance  has  also  affected  regularity  of  debt 
12:566:37977:13:14:70:524:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:payments.  The  access  to  finance  emerged  as  the  most  important  and  almost  independent 
12:567:38074:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factor for the company performance. It impacted positively also the degree of innovation, and 
12:568:38168:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indirectly – the adoption of good management practices and firm’s internationalization. It was 
12:569:38263:14:14:70:405:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influenced only by the firm’s size and intellectual property activities. 
12:570:38336:14:13:99:524:649:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Good   management   practices   affected directly SMEs   financial   results   (H6).   The 
12:571:38427:13:14:70:524:636:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:enterprises  with  higher  level  of  such  practices  (ICT  and  e-business  adoption,  staff  training, 
12:572:38533:14:14:70:524:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:strategic planning and marketing) have undergone a reduction of sales and profits to a lesser 
12:573:38627:14:14:70:524:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:extent  or  have  not  incurred  any.  Furthermore,  the  SMEs  with  a  higher  index  of  good 
12:574:38724:14:14:70:524:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:management  practices  had  no  personnel  layoffs  in  2010  unlike  the  ones  with  a  lower  index 
12:575:38827:14:13:70:524:580:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:values.  This  was  true,  however,  only  for  trade  and construction,  while  in  services  and 
12:576:38926:13:14:70:524:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:manufacturing  the  relationship  was  the  opposite.  Good  management  practices  contributed 
12:577:39022:14:14:70:523:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:positively  to  higher  innovativeness,  and  through  it  –  to  higher  trade  marks  and  patent 
12:578:39122:14:14:70:336:539:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:development, and greater level of internationalization.  
12:579:39179:14:14:99:524:525:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The SMEs size was at the bottom of the stronger development of all investigated factors 
12:580:39267:14:13:70:524:511:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for  competitiveness,  which  proved  the  H7.  Export  oriented  SMEs  had  a  direct  and  positive 
12:581:39369:13:14:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:impact  on  the  innovation,  through  it  -  on  good  management  practices,  intellectual  property 
12:582:39472:14:11:70:471:484:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:activities, and internationalization, and thus – on final company performance (H8).

12:584:39556:12:14:99:159:461:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Conclusion 
12:585:39567:14:14:99:524:447:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:These  results  revealed  relatively  new  relationships  between  factors  for  the  SMEs 
12:586:39658:14:14:70:524:433:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:survival in turbulent times. It turned out that the leading role of innovations, trademarks and 
12:587:39753:14:13:70:523:419:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:patents,   quality   standards   and   internationalization   in   achieving   sustainable   competitive 
12:588:39858:13:14:70:524:406:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:advantages was not always valid, but rather in times of “normal” functioning of the economy 
12:589:39950:14:14:70:524:392:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:or smooth growth. In times of crisis, these factors became supportive, while some supportive 
12:590:40043:14:14:70:524:378:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:transformed  into  most  important.  Innovation  and  internationalization,  which  are  fundament 
12:591:40142:14:14:70:524:364:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for mid-term business success, cannot lead to immediate positive impact on sales and profits, 
12:592:40236:14:13:70:524:350:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which  is  crucial  in  crisis  periods.  When  the  economy  catches  up  again  on  the  growth  path, 
12:593:40341:13:14:70:334:337:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:however, these factors could be the engine of growth.  
12:594:40396:14:14:99:524:323:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The other plausible explanation of the observed factors ordering could be related to the 
12:595:40485:14:14:70:524:309:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:country  stage  of  development.  It  might  be  that  this  factors  configuration  is  typical  for  the 
12:596:40592:14:14:70:524:295:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:efficiency driven economies, and not for innovation driven or factor driven ones (Porter et al., 
12:597:40689:14:13:70:299:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2002), but this hypothesis needs to be checked. 
12:598:40737:13:14:99:524:268:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Another  conclusion  was  that  the  survival  of  SMEs  in  conditions  of  crisis  depended 
12:599:40831:14:14:70:524:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainly on previously accumulated (through good management practices) and current usage of 
12:600:40921:14:14:70:524:240:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human capital. In times of crisis when the access to finance was aggravated and accompanied 
12:601:41013:14:14:70:524:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by  high  level  of  inter-company  indebtedness  and  decreased  sales,  the  short  run  business 
12:602:41113:14:13:70:524:212:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:success  required  an  efficient  use  of  available  human  capital.  Other  studies  have  also 
12:603:41211:13:14:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:confirmed  the  importance  of  human  capital  (Johnson et  al.,  1996),  and  concluded  that 
12:604:41307:14:14:70:524:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:businesses must keep good practices considering as their structural capital (Ngah and Ibrahim, 
12:605:41402:14:14:70:523:171:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2009, pp. 8, 9). Human capital stocks at company level refer not only to availability, but also 
12:606:41498:14:14:70:524:157:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:to  establishing  competence,  i.e.  staff  training.  According  to  Warner  (1996),  “learning  and 
12:607:41600:14:13:70:524:143:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:innovation  in  modern  economies  are  inextricably  linked"  (Warner,  1996,  p.  348).  Therefore, 
12:608:41702:13:14:70:524:130:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:companies  with  limited  resources  (SMEs)  or  countries  with  limited  natural  endowments 
12:609:41797:14:14:70:507:116:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:should invest in human capital as a strategy for competitive advantage (Chen et al., 2005). 
12:610:41889:14:14:99:523:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The   estimated   relationships   between   factors   for   competitiveness   and   economic 
12:611:41982:14:14:70:524:88:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:performance  in  crisis  allowed  for  identification  of  the  SMEs,  which  were  sustainable  in  the 
12:612:42087:14:0:70:523:74:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:short  run,  and  therefore  could  contribute  to  the  overcoming  of  the  crisis.  Such  companies 
13:613:42192:0:14:70:523:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  mostly  medium-sized,  with  greater  access  to  financial  resources,  and  with  higher 
13:614:42289:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:implementation  of  good  management  practices.  In  the  medium  term,  however,  higher 
13:615:42380:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:competitive potential have SMEs, which innovate, register patents and trademarks, and have a 
13:616:42473:14:13:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:higher  level  of  internationalization.  This  study  has  fully  confirmed  three  of  the  research 
13:617:42576:13:14:70:524:705:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hypotheses  (H5,  H6,  and  H7)  and  partially  the  other  five.  The  interpretation  of  results, 
13:618:42678:14:14:70:524:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:however,  was  limited  by  the  small  number  of  SMEs  as  well  as  the  prevalence  of  micro-
13:619:42777:14:14:70:524:677:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:enterprises  in  the  sample  (the  latter  are  not  typical  in  innovation,  internationalization, 
13:620:42879:14:14:70:524:663:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:intellectual  property  and  application  of  modern  management  practices).  Therefore,  further 
13:621:42978:14:13:70:373:649:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:surveys with greater representation of bigger SME are needed. 
13:622:43040:13:14:99:524:636:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The perspective of there  being two  groups of competitiveness factors does not in itself 
13:623:43130:14:14:70:524:622:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reveal new factors, but introduces a new perspective on the traditional dimensions of internal, 
13:624:43226:14:14:70:523:608:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:external,  and  related  to  entrepreneur  factors,  and their  interactions.  It  provides  much-needed 
13:625:43331:14:14:70:524:594:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:empirical evidence about configurations of SMEs competitiveness factors, and contributes to

13:627:43517:13:14:70:524:567:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:specific,  these  configurations  will  serve  better  to  inform  the  practices  of  entrepreneurs  and
