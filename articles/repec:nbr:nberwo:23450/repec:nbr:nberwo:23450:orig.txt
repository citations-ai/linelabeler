2:34:1806:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:We  explore  the  effects  of  recent  Medicaid  expansions  on  Medicaid-financed  prescriptions  for 
2:35:1909:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:evidence-based smoking  cessation  medications.    We  estimate  differences-in-differences  models 
2:36:2008:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:using  administrative data  on  the  universe  of  prescription  medications  sold  in  retail  and  online 
2:37:2115:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:pharmacies  for  which  Medicaid was  a  third-party  payer.    Our  findings  suggest  that  expansions 
2:38:2219:14:14:71:548:518:12:Times:12:Times:increased  smoking  cessation  prescriptions by  36%  with  heterogeneity  across  medication  class.  
2:39:2321:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:We provide evidence that these prescriptions were primarily financed by Medicaid programs and 
2:40:2414:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:not  patients,  and  that  our  estimates  reflect  increases in  prescriptions  among  newly  eligible 
2:41:2517:14:14:72:543:476:12:Times:12:Times:populations  and  not  other  populations  that  enrolled  in  Medicaid due  to  Affordable  Care  Act-
2:42:2619:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:related changes.  Overall our findings suggest that the recent Medicaid expansions allowed newly 
2:43:2715:14:28:71:422:448:12:Times:12:Times:insured low-income smokers to access efficacious cessation medications.

3:64:3223:0:27:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:65:3238:27:27:108:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:Smoking is the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, 
3:66:3328:27:28:72:512:654:144:Times:144:Times:leading to more than 480,000 deaths each year and accounting for 30% of all cancer deaths 
3:67:3418:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017).  Despite the well-established health 
3:68:3515:28:27:72:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:harms of smoking, the adult smoking rate remains stubbornly high at 15% (National Center for 
3:69:3608:27:28:72:534:571:144:Times:144:Times:Health Statistics 2017).  There is socioeconomic disparity in smoking: lower income groups are 
3:70:3703:28:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:more likely to smoke than higher income groups (National Center for Health Statistics 2017).  In 
3:71:3800:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:particular, within Medicaid, a public insurance program that finances healthcare services for low-
3:72:3898:27:28:72:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:income individuals, the smoking rate is 30% (National Center for Health Statistics 2017). 
3:73:3988:28:27:108:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:This high smoking rate within the Medicaid population is troubling from a public finance 
3:74:4077:27:28:72:531:433:144:Times:144:Times:perspective as smoking-attributable Medicaid costs (e.g., cancer treatments, chronic bronchitis, 
3:75:4174:28:28:72:498:405:144:Times:144:Times:and emphysema) will be borne predominately by taxpayers.  These costs are non-trivial: 
3:76:4261:28:27:72:502:377:144:Times:144:Times:smoking-related diseases accounted for 15%, or $45B,1 of annual Medicaid expenditures 
3:77:4347:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:between 2006 and 2010 (Xu et al. 2015).  Smoking cessation has been shown to both improve 
3:78:4437:28:27:72:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:health and reduce healthcare expenditures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010, 
3:79:4529:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:Warren et al. 2014, Richard, West, and Ku 2012), suggesting that promoting cessation within 
3:80:4620:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid broadly could confer substantial benefits to both government payers and enrollees.   
3:81:4714:28:27:108:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided enhanced federal matching 
3:82:4798:27:28:72:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:funds for states to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income (up to 138% of the federal 
3:83:4890:28:27:72:516:184:144:Times:144:Times:poverty level [FPL]), non-elderly, non-disabled adults.2  For all enrollees, the ACA requires 
3:84:4984:27:36:72:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid programs to cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription 
3:85:5068:36:9:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
3:86:5126:9:12:72:510:112:42:Times:99:Times:1 Inflated from the original estimate, $39B in 2010 dollars, to 2017 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.   
3:87:5237:12:14:72:502:100:42:Times:99:Times:2 F or states that expanded Medicaid, the federal government financed 100% of the costs for newly eligible 
3:88:5344:14:12:71:540:86:99:Times:99:Times:beneficiaries between 2014 and 2016.  After that time, the federal contribution declines to 90% by 2020 and remains 
3:89:5460:12:0:71:262:74:99:Times:99:Times:at that level (Kaiser Family Foundation 2014).  
4:90:5510:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:cessation medications with little to no cost-sharing (DiGiulio et al. 2016).  These medications are 
4:91:5610:28:27:72:505:681:144:Times:144:Times:efficacious (Biazzo et al. 2010, Ruger and Lazar 2012, Zhu et al. 2000, Aubin et al. 2008, 
4:92:5701:27:28:72:536:654:144:Times:144:Times:Cummings and Hyland 2005, Stead et al. 2012).  For instance, a recent meta-analysis found that 
4:93:5796:28:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:prescription cessation medications helped 50-80% smokers quit versus a placebo (Cahill et al. 
4:94:5890:28:27:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:2013).  While efficacious, these medications are expensive: prices range from $100 to $500 per 
4:95:5985:27:28:72:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:prescription for an uninsured smoker.3  Low income uninsured smokers may have limited ability 
4:96:6079:28:27:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:to access to these medications.  Indeed, Lillard et al. (2007) show that uninsured smokers are less 
4:97:6179:27:28:71:479:516:144:Times:144:Times:likely to use cessation medications in quit attempts than privately insured smokers.   
4:98:6266:28:28:107:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was generally limited to children, poor parents, 
4:99:6354:28:27:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:pregnant women, and the disabled (‘traditional populations’).  The newly eligible – primarily 
4:100:6448:27:28:72:534:433:144:Times:144:Times:low-income, non-disabled, and childless adults – have higher smoking rates and less experience 
4:101:6543:28:28:72:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:with the healthcare delivery system than traditional populations (DiGiulio et al. 2016, National 
4:102:6640:28:27:72:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:Center for Health Statistics 2014),4 suggesting that the newly eligible may benefit from coverage 
4:103:6738:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:obtained through the ACA-related expansions.  Recent estimates show that 2.3 million newly 
4:104:6829:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:eligible smokers gained access to Medicaid through the ACA expansions (DiGiulio et al. 2016), 
4:105:6923:27:28:72:443:295:144:Times:144:Times:which implies that the expansions have substantial scope to reduce smoking. 
4:106:6999:28:28:108:498:267:144:Times:144:Times:We examine the effect of ACA Medicaid eligibility expansions to newly eligible 
4:107:7078:28:49:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:populations on utilization of Medicaid-financed prescription medications for smoking cessation 
4:108:7173:49:8:72:217:190:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
4:109:7231:8:15:72:541:182:42:Times:99:Times:3 We conducted a non-systematic review of online sales of these medications for an uninsured smoker to retrieve our 
4:110:7347:15:12:71:426:167:99:Times:99:Times:price estimates (e.g., https://www.goodrx.com/zyban; https://www.goodrx.com/chantix; 
4:111:7432:12:8:72:325:155:99:Times:99:Times:https://www.goodrx.com/nicotrol; accessed April 26th, 2017).   
4:112:7495:8:16:72:532:147:42:g_d0_f5:99:Times:4 According to the National Center for Health Statistics official estimates, in 2013 (in advance of January 1st, 2014 
4:113:7612:16:11:71:516:131:99:Times:99:Times:when the majority of expansion states expanded Medicaid) the Medicaid smoking rate was 30%.  This number 
4:114:7717:11:12:71:513:120:99:Times:99:Times:should predominately reflect the smoking rate among traditional Medicaid eligible populations.  DiGuilio and 
4:115:7826:12:11:71:530:108:99:Times:99:Times:colleagues estimate a smoking rate of 38% among newly eligible enrollees.  We note that these estimates are from 
4:116:7939:11:11:71:536:97:99:Times:99:Times:different sources: the 2013 estimate is based on the National Health Interview Survey and the post-ACA estimate is 
4:117:8054:11:12:71:528:86:99:Times:99:Times:based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey combined 
4:118:8164:12:0:71:462:74:99:Times:99:g_d0_f5:with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System. 
5:119:8257:0:28:72:530:709:144:Times:144:Times:approved by the FDA.  To this end, we draw administrative data from the Medicaid State Drug 
5:120:8349:28:27:72:499:681:144:Times:144:Times:Utilization Database (SDUD) between 2011 and 2015.  These data cover the universe of 
5:121:8434:27:28:72:536:654:144:Times:144:Times:prescription medication claims purchased from retail and online pharmacies for which Medicaid 
5:122:8528:28:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:was a third-party payer.  While prescription fills do not directly capture medication use, previous 
5:123:8628:28:27:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:research documents that fills are a reliable proxy (Lehmann et al. 2014).  Moreover, fills are 
5:124:8723:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:common proxies within economics (Richards et al. 2017, Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017).   
5:125:8813:28:28:108:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:We contribute to the small literature that examines the impact of expanding access to 
5:126:8899:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:efficacious cessation medications within Medicaid in five important ways.  (i) We examine the 
5:127:8993:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:effect of expanding coverage to newly eligible Medicaid populations, which have very high 
5:128:9083:28:27:71:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:smoking rates and have had little access to insurance previously.  (ii) Our use of the SDUD 
5:129:9175:27:28:71:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:offers us access to the universe of Medicaid-f inanced prescription medications sold through retail 
5:130:9275:28:28:71:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:and online pharmacies, while previous studies have relied on survey data, which are vulnerable 
5:131:9370:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:to measurement error, or claims data that lack detailed payer information.  (iii) Our data contain 
5:132:9469:27:28:71:484:350:144:Times:144:Times:information on Medicaid payments which we leverage to explore whether changes in 
5:133:9550:28:27:71:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:prescriptions were financed by Medicaid or patients.  (iv) Because the medications we study 
5:134:9642:27:28:71:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:require a formal prescription from a healthcare provider, we are able to indirectly explore the

5:136:9831:28:27:71:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:changing U.S. healthcare delivery system, with which they have little experience.  (v) We study 
5:137:9927:27:28:71:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:an important behavioral intermediary outcome: use of prescription cessation medications.  The 
5:138:10021:28:27:71:501:184:144:Times:144:Times:literature on the smoking effects of ACA Medicaid expansions, which has examined self-
5:139:10107:27:28:71:502:157:144:Times:144:Times:reported smoking in survey settings, is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, 
5:140:10194:28:28:71:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:Courtemanche et al. 2017a), perhaps because cessation takes time and studies rely on, at most, 
5:141:10289:28:0:71:517:101:144:Times:144:Times:two years of post-2014 data.  If cessation medications are a mechanism through which these 
6:142:10382:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:insurance expansions assist smokers quit, then we should observe changes in prescriptions prior 
6:143:10478:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:to changes in reported smoking status.  Further, when assessing the value of a large-scale policy 
6:144:10576:27:28:72:524:654:144:Times:144:Times:intervention such as the ACA, understanding how the intervention affected healthcare service 
6:145:10669:28:28:72:413:626:144:Times:144:Times:use is important independent of intervention benefits (i.e., cessation).   
6:146:10744:28:27:108:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:Our results suggest that expanding Medicaid to newly eligible populations increased 
6:147:10828:27:28:72:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:utilization of smoking cessation medications: post expansion Medicaid-financed prescription 
6:148:10920:28:28:72:496:543:144:Times:144:Times:medications for smoking cessation increased by 36% in expansion states relative to non-
6:149:11007:28:27:72:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:expansion states with effects driven primarily by Zyban; the lowest cost FDA-approved 
6:150:11093:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:prescription medication for cessation.  A dynamic model documents that effects increased over 
6:151:11187:28:27:72:505:460:144:Times:144:Times:time, which implies that we may observe more definitive evidence of smoking reductions 
6:152:11274:27:28:72:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:attributable to Medicaid expansion as time passes.  Further, we document that these cessation 
6:153:11367:28:28:72:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:medications were primarily financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients.  Finally, 
6:154:11458:28:27:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:prescription effects appear to be driven by increases in newly eligible populations and not other 
6:155:11556:27:28:71:413:350:144:Times:144:Times:groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related policy changes.   
6:156:11626:28:27:107:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:This manuscript is organized as follows.  Section 2 provides a review of the Medicaid 
6:157:11711:27:28:71:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:program, outlines a conceptual model, and discusses the related literature.  Data, variables, and 
6:158:11809:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:methods are presented in Section 3.  Main results are reported in Section 4, and extensions and 
6:159:11905:28:27:71:497:239:144:Times:144:Times:sensitivity analyses are presented in Section 5.  Finally, Section 6 provides a discussion.

6:161:12052:28:27:71:203:184:144:Times:144:Times:2.1 The Medicaid program 
6:162:12077:27:28:107:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid finances healthcare services, including cessation services, for low income 
6:163:12161:28:0:71:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:people.  Medicaid is a federal and state program, with states establishing policies within a set of 
7:164:12263:0:28:72:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:federal laws.  Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly adults in most states was 
7:165:12359:28:27:72:472:681:144:Times:144:Times:limited to people with disabilities, pregnant women, and parents of poor children.   
7:166:12443:27:28:108:508:654:144:Times:144:Times:The ACA originally mandated all states expand Medicaid or lose federal Medicaid 
7:167:12523:28:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:funding.  In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to expand eligibility to 
7:168:12620:28:27:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:retain federal funding.  This ruling left Medicaid expansion optional to states.  The decision to 
7:169:12718:27:28:72:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:expand Medicaid was largely determined by the party controlling the state’s lower legislative 
7:170:12812:28:28:72:320:543:144:Times:144:Times:chamber (Sobel 2014, Courtemanche et al. 2017b). 
7:171:12861:28:27:108:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:Starting in 2014, the federal government generously subsidized states’ expansions of 
7:172:12946:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid eligibility to most residents with incomes below 138% of the FPL; the threshold is 
7:173:13038:28:27:71:495:460:144:Times:144:Times:133% and there is an additional 5 percentage point disregard in both expansion and non-
7:174:13125:27:28:71:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:expansion states.5  By 2017, 32 states, including the District of Columbia, had expanded their 
7:175:13220:28:28:71:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid programs under the ACA, and adults covered under this provision are referred to as 
7:176:13312:28:27:71:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:‘newly eligible.’  For non-expansion states, starting January 1st, 2014, the 5 percentage point 
7:177:13408:27:28:72:500:350:144:Times:144:Times:disregard (‘disregard’) increased income eligibility thresholds for traditional groups by 5 
7:178:13500:28:27:72:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:percentage points of FPL over the state’s March 2010 income thresholds.  Populations that 
7:179:13590:27:28:72:402:295:144:Times:144:Times:gained coverage through this increase are not termed newly eligible. 
7:180:13658:28:28:108:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:Prior to the ACA, states had substantial discretion in deciding what services to cover in 
7:181:13748:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:their Medicaid programs, and coverage of cessation products varied considerably (Singleterry et 
7:182:13844:27:45:72:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:al. 2014).  Starting in January 2014, section 2502 of the Act required states to cover FDA-
7:183:13935:45:9:72:217:167:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
7:184:13993:9:15:72:541:158:42:Times:99:Times:5 In most states, childless adults of any income level were not eligible for Medicaid prior to the ACA.  In early 2010, 
7:185:14113:15:12:72:527:143:99:Times:99:Times:only 6 states (Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) used federal waivers to offer 
7:186:14223:12:11:72:538:131:99:Times:99:Times:full Medicaid benefits to childless adults, and although 12 states offered limited benefits to this population, many of 
7:187:14343:11:12:72:525:120:99:Times:99:Times:these latter programs were closed to new applicants (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2009).  
7:188:14452:12:11:72:531:108:99:Times:99:Times:Using the early expansion option of the ACA, 5 additional states (California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey 
7:189:14565:11:11:72:532:97:99:Times:99:Times:and Washington) expanded eligibility to childless adults before 2014.  In 2010, the District of Columbia, however, 
7:190:14680:11:12:72:529:86:99:Times:99:Times:was the only jurisdiction to use the early expansion option to provide for full benefits to 200% of FPL; others had 
7:191:14796:12:0:72:512:74:99:Times:99:Times:income thresholds below 138% FPL or limited eligibility to adults who were in older state-funded programs.  
8:192:14906:0:28:72:501:709:144:Times:144:Times:approved cessation products, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, for all 
8:193:14995:28:27:72:475:681:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid enrollees.  These products include the prescription  cessation medications 
8:194:15079:27:28:72:509:654:144:Times:144:Times:Zyban/bupropion (‘Zyban’) and Chantix/varenicline (‘Chantix’), and nicotine replacement 
8:195:15167:28:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:therapies (NRT) such as patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays, and inhalers (Food and Drug 
8:196:15257:28:27:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:Administration 2015).  NRTs are available OTC and through formal prescriptions: patches, gum, 
8:197:15351:27:28:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:and lozenges are available OTC while nasal sprays and inhalers require a prescription.  The ACA 
8:198:15447:28:28:72:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:does not regulate utilization management techniques for these medications but the Act does 
8:199:15538:28:27:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:encourage removing cost-sharing (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2012).   
8:200:15628:27:28:108:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:The ACA Medicaid changes most relevant to our study are the increased number of 
8:201:15708:28:27:72:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:enrollees and improved coverage for prescription cessation medications.  These changes have 
8:202:15800:27:28:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:implications for a study of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking among the newly eligible.  
8:203:15890:28:28:108:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:Increases in the number of Medicaid enrollees are attributable to coverage increases in 
8:204:15978:28:27:72:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:three groups: newly eligible adults, previously eligible individuals who opted to take up 
8:205:16068:27:28:72:525:350:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid post-expansion; i.e., ‘welcome mat’ effects (Sonier, Boudreaux, and Blewett 2013), 
8:206:16160:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:and individuals who became eligible in non-expansion states due to the disregard.  Our data – 
8:207:16254:27:28:72:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:administrative counts of Medicaid-financed prescription medications – do not allow us to 
8:208:16343:28:27:72:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:distinguish between these groups, but we attempt to isolate newly eligible effects.6  We next 
8:209:16437:27:28:71:485:240:144:Times:144:Times:review the available evidence and our approaches to isolating newly eligible effects.   
8:210:16524:28:28:107:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that welcome mat effects are similar across 
8:211:16607:28:27:71:510:184:144:Times:144:Times:expansion and non-expansion states.  Our empirical model (differences-in-differences) can 
8:212:16697:27:28:71:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:account for common shocks to expansion and non-expansion states through inclusion of period 
8:213:16789:28:31:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:fixed effects.  Under the assumption that welcome-mat effects are common across states, we are 
8:214:16884:31:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
8:215:16942:9:15:72:529:89:42:Times:99:Times:6 This limitation is common within the ACA-Medicaid expansion literature that relies on administrative or survey 
8:216:17055:15:0:72:500:74:99:Times:99:Times:data (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Wen et al. 2017). 
9:217:17159:0:28:72:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:able to empirically account for these effects.7  Because the income disregard changes affect 
9:218:17252:28:27:71:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:populations at different levels of the income distribution (i.e., within 5 percentage points of the 
9:219:17352:27:28:71:530:654:144:Times:144:Times:state’s March 2010 income eligibility threshold), these effects are not subsumed by the state or 
9:220:17449:28:28:71:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:period fixed effects included in our differences-in-differences models.  Hence, our baseline 
9:221:17542:28:27:71:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:regression model cannot discriminate between newly eligible and those individuals who became 
9:222:17635:27:28:71:300:571:144:Times:144:Times:eligible due to the income disregard changes.    
9:223:17684:28:28:107:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:To dig deeper into this question, we estimate three extensions to the main analysis.  
9:224:17770:28:27:71:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:Specifically, we (i) estimate a triple difference-style model that leverages variation in pre-ACA 
9:225:17868:27:28:71:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid total enrollment and post-ACA newly eligible enrollment to isolate effects for the 
9:226:17960:28:27:71:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:newly-eligible from other groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to the ACA; (ii) separately study 
9:227:18056:27:28:71:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:managed care (MC) Medicaid financed prescriptions as the newly-eligibles are disproportionally 
9:228:18151:28:27:71:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016);8 and (iii) 
9:229:18239:27:28:71:536:378:144:Times:144:Times:select a sample of states for which we can separate newly eligible effects from income disregard 
9:230:18336:28:28:71:511:350:144:Times:144:Times:effects.  While each of these explorations of the data has important limitations and caveats, 
9:231:18430:28:27:71:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:collectively the results generated in these extensions imply that our results are primarily 
9:232:18522:27:28:71:477:295:144:Times:144:Times:attributable to changes in prescription medications within newly eligible enrollees.   
9:233:18609:28:28:107:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:The ACA increased coverage for cessation services in states that had limited coverage of 
9:234:18698:28:27:71:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:these services before the Act was implemented.  For traditional populations, increased coverage 
9:235:18794:27:28:71:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:for cessation medications plausibly increased service use.  These changes, if present, imply that 
9:236:18892:28:27:71:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:our estimates will capture both increased utilization among the newly eligible enrollees and 
9:237:18985:27:36:71:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:among traditional enrollees that gained improved coverage for cessation services.  We address 
9:238:19079:36:9:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
9:239:19137:9:15:72:496:112:42:Times:99:Times:7 Moreover, Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that the ACA Medicaid expansions did not lead to 
9:240:19237:15:8:72:257:97:99:Times:99:Times:measureable crowd-out of private insurance.   
9:241:19283:8:15:72:511:89:42:Times:99:Times:8 For instance, in 2017 27 expansion states had MC plans and in 25 of these states, 80% or more of the newly 
9:242:19392:15:0:72:501:74:99:Times:99:Times:eligible were enrolled in MC plans and in 17 states over 90% were enrolled in MC plans (Paradise 2017).   
10:243:19500:0:28:72:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:this issue by focusing on states that experienced no change in coverage for these medications 
10:244:19594:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:during our study period; thus effects in this sample should largely reflect effects for populations 
10:245:19694:27:28:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:that enrolled in Medicaid and not previously eligible populations that gained improved coverage 
10:246:19790:28:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:for cessation services.  We find that our results are not sensitive to this sample selection, which 
10:247:19890:28:27:72:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that our findings are not fully explained by continuously enrolled populations.9   
10:248:19982:27:28:108:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:In summary, while we cannot fully rule out the possibility that our estimates of newly 
10:249:20069:28:28:72:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:eligible effects are contaminated by other groups affected by ACA Medicaid changes, we 
10:250:20156:28:27:72:447:515:144:Times:144:Times:contend that our estimates largely reflect changes among the newly elgibles.   
10:251:20235:27:28:72:203:488:144:Times:144:Times:2.2 Conceptual framework 
10:252:20260:28:27:108:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:The Grossman (1972) model of the demand for health and healthcare services motivates 
10:253:20345:27:28:72:516:433:144:Times:144:Times:our study.  In the Grossman model consumers do not demand healthcare services per se, but 
10:254:20435:28:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:instead they demand the health improvements attributable to utilization of such services.   
10:255:20526:28:27:108:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:In our study, consumers seeking to improve health by quitting their smoking addiction 
10:256:20612:27:28:72:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:could plausibly demand smoking cessation prescription medications.  Consumers maximize a 
10:257:20701:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:utility function given the price of healthcare services and other goods, preferences, a health 
10:258:20796:27:28:72:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:endowment, a health production function, other factors that determine health, and a budget 
10:259:20887:28:28:72:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:constraint.  Consumers are assumed to respond to healthcare price changes in a manner 
10:260:20973:28:27:72:487:239:144:Times:144:Times:comparable to other goods and services.  We investigate the effect of recent Medicaid 
10:261:21059:27:28:72:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:expansions on demand for smoking cessation medications.  Medicaid – by reducing the out-of-
10:262:21150:28:75:72:528:184:144:Times:144:Times:pocket price – should increase the quantity of cessation medications demanded by consumers.  
10:263:21243:75:9:72:217:109:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
10:264:21301:9:14:72:509:100:42:Times:99:Times:9 A comparable concern is that early expansion states (Table 1) were not required to cover cessation services 
10:265:21411:14:12:72:531:86:99:Times:99:Times:between their expansion date and January 1st, 2014.   As discussed later in the manuscript, we have excluded these 
10:266:21526:12:0:71:398:74:99:Times:99:Times:states from our analysis and results are not appreciably different (see Table 16).   
11:267:21614:0:28:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times: There are several factors unique to either Medicaid or addictive goods such as cigarettes 
11:268:21703:28:27:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:which may mute price effects.  (i) Insurance does not always reduce out-of-pocket prices as 
11:269:21795:27:28:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:many providers do not accept Medicaid, indeed a major concern among ACA policy makers was 
11:270:21885:28:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:lack of provider participation in Medicaid (Decker 2012).  (iii) Ex ante moral hazard suggests 
11:271:21980:28:27:72:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:that, by lowering smoking-attributable healthcare costs, insurance may incentivize individuals – 
11:272:22077:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:who no longer face the full costs of their health behaviors – to delay or deter smoking cessation 
11:273:22174:28:27:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:(Klick and Stratmann 2006).10  (iv) If insurance acts as an in-kind income transfer to the newly 
11:274:22271:27:28:72:509:516:144:Times:144:Times:eligible, and if smoking is a normal good (Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban 2014), the newly 
11:275:22360:28:28:72:480:488:144:Times:144:Times:eligible may in fact increase smoking.  (v) Finally, other ACA-related changes (e.g., 
11:276:22446:28:27:72:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:communication efforts, simplification of the enrollment process) may amplify Medicaid effects 
11:277:22540:27:28:72:389:433:144:Times:144:Times:through non-price channels (Frean, Gruber, and Sommers 2016).  
11:278:22603:28:28:108:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:The question of whether, and to what extent, ACA Medicaid expansions lead to changes 
11:279:22687:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:in prescription cessation medications is ultimately an empirical question.  While our differences-
11:280:22785:27:28:71:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:in-differences methods will not allow us to explore these specific pathways, our objective is to 
11:281:22882:28:27:71:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:provide evidence on the net effect.  Moreover, the decision to expand Medicaid is the most direct 
11:282:22980:27:28:71:297:295:144:Times:144:Times:policy lever under consideration among states. 
11:283:23027:28:28:71:141:267:144:Times:144:Times:2.3 Literature 
11:284:23041:28:27:107:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:We review literature on the price elasticity of demand for cessation medications and the 
11:285:23130:27:28:72:208:212:144:Times:144:Times:related Medicaid literature.  
11:286:23159:28:27:108:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:While there is a substantial economic literature that estimates the elasticity of demand for 
11:287:23252:27:28:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:cigarettes (Tauras et al. 2016, Maclean, Webber, and Marti 2014, Pesko et al. 2016, Decicca et 
11:288:23347:28:31:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:al. 2008, Chaloupka and Warner 2000, Gallet and List 2003), a relatively small set of studies has 
11:289:23445:31:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
11:290:23503:9:15:72:507:89:42:Times:99:Times:10 We note that an ex post moral hazard story would suggest that cessation medication use will increase post-
11:291:23612:15:0:72:202:74:99:Times:99:Times:expansion in expanding states.   
12:292:23648:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:estimated price elasticities for cessation medications.  These studies are informative for our work 
12:293:23748:28:27:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:as insurance reduces the out-of-pocket price for cessation medications.  Tauras and Chaloupka 
12:294:23842:27:28:72:531:654:144:Times:144:Times:(2003) estimate that the average own-price elasticity of demand for a nicotine patches and gum 
12:295:23936:28:28:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:were -2.3 and -2.5 respectively, suggesting that smokers’ demand for these products is highly 
12:296:24030:28:27:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:elastic.  Paterson et al. (2008) and Marti (2012) show, using choice experiments, that smokers 
12:297:24125:27:28:72:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:were less likely to choose a cessation medication when its price was experimentally increased.  
12:298:24221:28:28:72:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:While not formally estimating a price elasticity of demand, Keeler et al. (2002) document that 
12:299:24316:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:when a cessation medication became available OTC, rather than requiring a prescription from a 
12:300:24410:27:28:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:provider which is costly to the consumer, the quantity demanded of this product increased.   
12:301:24503:28:27:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times: Several studies show that pre-ACA Medicaid expansions – which primarily affected 
12:302:24584:27:28:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:traditional populations – increased utilization of cessation medications and reduced smoking.  
12:303:24679:28:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:The extent to which these findings can generalize to the ACA’s newly eligible adults is unclear. 
12:304:24776:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:Liu (2009) documents higher smoking cessation rates among non-elderly adult women residing 
12:305:24867:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:in states with a higher composite index of Medicaid coverage for cessation medications.  Liu 
12:306:24960:28:27:72:494:322:144:Times:144:Times:(2010) shows that Medicaid coverage increased quit attempts while Greene, Sacks, and 
12:307:25045:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:McMenamin (2014) find that reduced cost-sharing led to higher cessation rates among Medicaid 
12:308:25138:28:28:71:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:recipients.  Adams et al. (2013) and Jarlenski et al. (2014) show that Medicaid participation, and  
12:309:25238:28:27:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:enrollment and coverage policies reduced maternal smoking.  Witman (2013) documents that 
12:310:25327:27:28:72:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:expanded Medicaid coverage reduced smoking by 6% among low-income individuals who report 
12:311:25416:28:27:72:499:184:144:Times:144:Times:ever smoking.  Richards et al. (2017) use insurance claims show that coverage increased 
12:312:25504:27:71:72:436:157:144:Times:144:Times:utilization by 20 prescriptions for Zyban and Chantix per 10,000 persons.11 
12:313:25579:71:8:72:217:86:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
12:314:25637:8:0:72:452:78:42:Times:99:Times:11 A limitation of the Richards study is that the authors were not able to explore payer source.   
13:315:25738:0:28:108:500:709:144:Times:144:Times:The early literature evaluating the ACA Medicaid expansions finds evidence that 
13:316:25818:28:27:72:527:681:144:Times:144:Times:prescription medications increased, but no study examines cessation medications.12  Medicaid-
13:317:25911:27:28:71:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:financed prescription utilization increased by 19% in expansion states relative to non-expansion 
13:318:26008:28:28:71:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:states (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017).  Wen et al. (2017) show that utilization of Medicaid-
13:319:26102:28:27:71:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:financed buprenorphine (a medication used to treat opioid use disorder) prescriptions increased 
13:320:26198:27:28:71:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:by 70% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  Maclean and Saloner (2017) find 
13:321:26291:28:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:that use of Medicaid-financed medications used to treat a wider set of substance use disorders, all 
13:322:26391:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol and drug use disorders (but not smoking cessation), 
13:323:26485:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:increased by 43% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  Finally, Maclean et al. 
13:324:26581:28:27:72:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:(2017) show that, post-expansion, prescriptions for psychotropic medications used to treat 
13:325:26672:27:28:72:533:433:144:Times:144:Times:mental illness increased 22% in expanding states relative to non-expanding states.  Importantly, 
13:326:26769:28:28:71:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:these papers do not attempt to isolate effects for the newly eligible and, instead, plausibly capture 
13:327:26871:28:27:71:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:effects for newly eligible, previously eligible populations that enrolled due to welcome mat 
13:328:26964:27:28:71:458:350:144:Times:144:Times:effects, and populations that become eligible due to income disregard changes.   
13:329:27045:28:27:107:542:322:144:Times:144:Times: The effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking are mixed which is not entirely 
13:330:27132:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:surprising as studies rely on just two years of post-2014 data and the transition from smoking to 
13:331:27230:28:28:72:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:cessation is time-intensive.  Longitudinal evidence suggests that a smoker attempts to quit on 
13:332:27325:28:27:71:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer (Chaiton et al. 2016).  
13:333:27424:27:28:71:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) find that Medicaid expansion reduced past 30-day smoking 
13:334:27512:28:86:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:among childless non-elderly adults by 6% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  
13:335:27608:86:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
13:336:27666:9:15:72:536:89:42:Times:99:Times:12 Young-Wolff et al. (2017) use a pre-post design to provide evidence that cessation medication use increased post-
13:337:27782:15:0:72:447:74:99:Times:99:Times:expansion among Medicaid enrollees in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system.   
14:338:27875:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:Smoking propensities were not altered by the expansion in any other group.  Courtemanche et al. 
14:339:27971:28:28:72:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:(2017a), using the same data,13 find no evidence that these expansions affected smoking.    
14:340:28063:28:27:72:236:653:144:Times:144:Times:3. Data, variables, and methods 
14:341:28095:27:28:72:234:626:144:Times:144:Times:3.1 Prescription medication data 
14:342:28128:28:27:108:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:We use the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database (SDUD).  The SDUD is compiled 
14:343:28210:27:28:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) from administrative data submitted by state 
14:344:28301:28:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid programs and include all states’ data for outpatient prescription medications (initial 
14:345:28397:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:fills and refills) covered under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for which Medicaid serves as 
14:346:28492:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:a third-party payer (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012).  Since 1992, state 
14:347:28584:28:27:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid programs have been required to submit data on the number and type of prescriptions 
14:348:28676:27:28:72:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:filled and refilled each quarter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in 
14:349:28766:28:28:72:259:405:144:Times:144:Times:exchange for federal matching funds.   
14:350:28804:28:27:108:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:We use data from 2011 to 2015 in our study, and have 20 periods of data for each state: 
14:351:28892:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:12 pre-2014 and 8 post-2014.  While the SDUD has data from fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid 
14:352:28982:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:since 1992, prescription fills and refills obtained through managed care (MC) plans were added 
14:353:29077:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:in March, 2010 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012).  We use data from 2011 
14:354:29168:28:27:72:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:onward to ensure that we are able to include both FFS and MC data (Wen et al. 2017).14  The 
14:355:29260:27:28:72:530:240:144:Times:144:Times:ability to measure MC data when analyzing the ACA Medicaid expansions is imperative as the 
14:356:29351:28:91:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:majority of the newly eligible are enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and 
14:357:29442:91:9:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
14:358:29500:9:15:72:531:112:42:Times:99:Times:13 Simon et al use a differences-in-differences model comparable to the one we estimate while Courtemanche et al 
14:359:29613:15:11:71:513:97:99:Times:99:Times:take a third difference based on pre-ACA insurance rates within a local area.  We are unable to implement the 
14:360:29723:11:8:71:444:86:99:Times:99:Times:Courtemanche et al method in our state-level data that focuses on a single payer (Medicaid). 
14:361:29816:8:0:72:482:78:42:Times:99:Times:14 Specifically, we aggregate data from both FFS and MC Medicaid to create a single quarter of data.   
15:362:29921:0:28:72:505:709:144:Times:144:Times:the Uninsured 2016).  We exclude five states – Arizona, Hawaii, Ohio, Rhode Island, and 
15:363:30009:28:27:72:285:681:144:Times:144:Times:Virginia – that display odd data patterns.15   
15:364:30056:27:28:108:516:654:144:Times:144:Times:We focus on prescription medications approved by the FDA for cessation (Food and 
15:365:30137:28:28:72:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:Drug Administration 2015): Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol (an NRT with inhaler and spray 
15:366:30224:28:27:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:versions).16  We create these categories using crosswalks between National Drug Codes (NDCs) 
15:367:30317:27:28:72:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:for brand name and generics obtained from the National Bureau of Economic Research (Roth 
15:368:30406:28:27:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:2017).17  Our main analysis combines all medications, but we also study each medication 
15:369:30493:27:28:72:540:516:144:Times:144:Times:separately.  There are two main limitations of the SDUD data.  (i) They capture aggregate counts 
15:370:30590:28:28:72:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:of prescription initial fills and refills, and do not provide information on patient or provider 
15:371:30687:28:27:72:467:460:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics.18  (ii) They do not include rebates by manufacturers to the states.   
15:372:30774:27:28:72:190:433:144:Times:144:Times:3.2 Medicaid expansion 
15:373:30797:28:28:108:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 summarizes our classification of expansion states.  The majority of expansion 
15:374:30883:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:states implemented their expansion on January 1st, 2014.  Two states expanded Medicaid later in 
15:375:30979:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:2014 (Michigan and New Hampshire) and five states expanded in 2015 or 2016 (Alaska, Indiana, 
15:376:31072:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:Louisiana, Montana, and Pennsylvania) and we refer to these states as ‘late expansion states’.  
15:377:31168:27:28:71:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:Prior to 2011, four states (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) and the District of

15:381:31502:9:11:72:503:192:42:Times:99:Times:15 Including these five states does not change our results in a meaningful way.  Details available on request. 
15:382:31612:11:15:72:520:181:42:Times:99:Times:16 Specific medication classifications that we use to identify these medications are available on request from the 
15:383:31727:15:11:71:524:166:99:Times:99:Times:corresponding author.  Zyban can be used for multiple purposes including cessation, depression, attention deficit 
15:384:31841:11:12:71:528:155:99:Times:99:Times:disorder, obesity, and substance use (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm089835.pdf (accessed 
15:385:31950:12:12:72:527:143:99:Times:99:Times:March 31st, 2017).  We wish to focus on Zyban that is prescribed to aid cessation.  Thus, in our main analyses we 
15:386:32064:12:11:72:522:131:99:Times:99:Times:include the following medications: proprietary name Zyban, Buproban, or bupropion, extended release, with the 
15:387:32174:11:12:72:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:strength 150mg.  In unreported analyses, we have applied more inclusive definitions which, we suspect, include 
15:388:32285:12:8:72:425:108:99:Times:99:Times:Zyban prescriptions for other purposes.  Results, available on request, are comparable.

15:390:32464:11:15:72:508:89:42:Times:99:Times:18 Thus we cannot study the number unique prescription users, because some patients may try more than one 
15:391:32570:15:0:71:374:74:99:Times:99:Times:medication.  However, we are interested in overall changes in service use.   
16:392:32649:0:28:72:504:709:144:Times:144:Times:enrollees.  The SDUD data are available at the quarter level, and thus we match Medicaid 
16:393:32738:28:27:71:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:expansion dates to this dataset based on state-year-quarter.  Our classification  closely follows 
16:394:32836:27:28:71:392:654:144:Times:144:Times:Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017).   
16:395:32899:28:28:71:183:626:144:Times:144:Times:3.3 Outcome variables 
16:396:32921:28:27:107:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:We construct the number of prescriptions filled and refilled for all three medications.19  
16:397:33012:27:28:72:535:571:144:Times:144:Times:We construct total payments and Medicaid and non-Medicaid payments, which allows us to test 
16:398:33103:28:28:71:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:whether Medicaid or patients financed medications.  We convert payments to 2015 dollars using 
16:399:33197:28:27:71:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:a healthcare cost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator (Dunn, Grosse, and Zuvekas 2018). 
16:400:33287:27:28:71:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:For each state, we divide each outcome variable by the total population between the ages of 18 to 
16:401:33385:28:27:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:64 years age (the group most likely to be affected by ACA Medicaid expansions (Simon, Soni, 
16:402:33477:27:28:72:510:433:144:Times:144:Times:and Cawley 2017)) of age using data drawn from the American Community Survey (ACS) 
16:403:33559:28:27:72:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:(Flood et al. 2017) and the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016).20 
16:404:33654:27:28:72:178:378:144:Times:144:Times:3.4 Control variables 
16:405:33676:28:28:108:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:We control for a range of state-level variables in our regressions.  First, we merge in 
16:406:33764:28:27:72:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:tobacco cigarette and electronic cigarette regulations: taxes and bans on use in public places 
16:407:33859:27:28:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:(restaurants, bars, and private worksites) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
16:408:33954:28:28:72:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:(2016) STATE System.  These variables reflect the costs of related goods.  We use the tax in 
16:409:34047:28:107:72:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:dollars per package of 20 tobacco cigarettes and an indicator for an e-cigarette tax.  For public 
16:410:34145:107:9:72:217:132:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
16:411:34203:9:11:72:358:123:42:Times:99:Times:19 The specific NDCs used for these outcomes are available on request. 
16:412:34273:11:15:72:530:112:42:Times:99:Times:20 We could have standardized our outcomes by the number of Medicaid enrollees.  However, we chose not to use 
16:413:34383:15:11:72:539:97:99:Times:99:Times:this standardization as the number of enrollees is clearly influenced by a states’ decision to expand Medicaid.  Thus, 
16:414:34502:11:12:72:514:86:99:Times:99:Times:we would have an endogenous numerator and denominator which complicates interpretation of our regression 
16:415:34607:12:0:72:441:74:99:Times:99:Times:coefficients as there would be two changing objects (cessation medications and enrollees).   
17:416:34703:0:28:72:533:709:144:Times:144:Times:use bans, we construct separate variables for tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes that capture the 
17:417:34802:28:27:72:452:681:144:Times:144:Times:count of the number of venues in which a state imposes a ban on product use.   
17:418:34880:27:28:108:528:654:144:Times:144:Times:Second, we merge in data on state-level demographics from the Annual and Social and 
17:419:34964:28:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS): average age, sex, race, Hispanic 
17:420:35057:28:27:72:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:ethnicity, and education.  Third, we link the annual seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the 
17:421:35155:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:state from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Database and the poverty 
17:422:35246:28:28:72:487:543:144:Times:144:Times:rate (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) to the SDUD. 
17:423:35329:28:27:108:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:Fourth, we control for state social policies targeting lower income populations.  To this 
17:424:35419:27:28:72:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:end, we turn to the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016) and we 
17:425:35511:28:27:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:control for the maximum Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit for a family 
17:426:35603:27:28:72:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:of four, the maximum Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit for a family 
17:427:35695:28:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:of four, and the effective state minimum wage (i.e., the higher of the federal or state minimum 
17:428:35791:28:27:71:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:wage).  We also include an indicator for a Democratic governor; we treat the mayor of the 
17:429:35881:27:28:71:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:District of Columbia as the de facto governor of this locality (Maclean and Saloner 2018).  We 
17:430:35976:28:27:71:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:convert all financial variables to constant 2015 dollars using the above-noted GDP deflator.21   
17:431:36073:27:28:72:173:295:144:Times:144:Times:3.5 Empirical model

17:436:36438:28:28:72:517:155:144:Times:144:Times:a vector of state-year level characteristics.  푆푆푠푠 and 휏휏푠푠 are vectors of state and year-by-quarter 
17:437:36540:28:29:71:537:127:144:Times:144:Times:fixed effects.  Inclusion of state fixed effects controls for time-invariant state-level unobservable

17:439:36700:9:15:72:509:89:42:Times:99:Times:21 We do not attempt to control for state-year smoking rates, a determinant of demand for smoking cessation, 
17:440:36809:15:0:71:495:74:99:Times:99:Times:because smoking rates are plausibly endogenous to the policy we study (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017). 
18:441:36914:0:28:72:493:709:144:Times:144:Times:factors and implies that our models are identified off within-state variation in Medicaid 
18:442:37004:28:27:71:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:expansions.  Year-by-quarter fixed effects control for secular trends in cessation medication use 
18:443:37102:27:28:71:506:654:144:Times:144:Times:that affect the nation as a whole (e.g., national anti-smoking campaigns) and ACA-related 
18:444:37192:28:28:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:changes that plausibly apply to all states (e.g., welcome-mat effects).  We also include a vector 
18:445:37290:28:28:71:371:598:144:Times:144:Times:of state-specific linear time trends (Ω푠푠푠푠).  휀휀푠푠푠푠 is the error term. 
18:446:37362:28:27:72:525:570:144:Times:144:Times: We estimate regressions using unweighted OLS and cluster standard errors around the 
18:447:37446:27:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).  The 46 clusters (after dropping 5 states with 
18:448:37541:28:28:72:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:missing data) allow us to consistently estimate standard errors (Cameron and Miller 2015).  
18:449:37633:28:27:72:131:487:144:Times:144:Times:3.6 Validity 
18:450:37645:27:28:108:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:A necessary assumption for the DD model to recover causal estimates is that the 
18:451:37725:28:27:72:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:treatment group (i.e., states with substantial expansions) and the comparison group (i.e., states 
18:452:37823:27:28:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:without expansions) would follow the same trend in the post-treatment period, had the treatment 
18:453:37919:28:28:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:states not been treated.  However, this assumption is inherently untestable.  We instead attempt 
18:454:38016:28:27:72:386:349:144:Times:144:Times:to provide suggestive evidence on this assumption in two ways.   
18:455:38080:27:28:108:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:(i) We examine unadjusted trends in the pre-treatment period in our outcome variables 
18:456:38166:28:27:72:534:294:144:Times:144:Times:for the treatment and comparison groups.  If we find that the outcomes appear to trend similarly 
18:457:38263:27:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:in the pre-treatment period across these groups, such trends provide suggestive evidence that the 
18:458:38361:28:28:72:501:239:144:Times:144:Times:SDUD data satisfy the parallel trends assumption.  (ii) Using only pre-treatment data, we 
18:459:38451:28:28:72:503:211:144:Times:144:Times:estimate regression models similar to Equation (1), except that we replace the  퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸푠푠푠푠

19:467:39064:27:28:71:183:598:144:Times:144:Times:4.1 Summary statistics 
19:468:39086:28:27:107:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 reports summary statistics for both expansion and non-expansion states in the 
19:469:39172:27:28:71:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:period 2011 to 2013.  States with substantial expansions before 2011 are excluded from this 
19:470:39264:28:28:71:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:comparison.  We also report p-values from t-tests assessing the statistical significance of the 
19:471:39360:28:27:71:524:487:144:Times:144:Times:differences between the two groups.  The annual number of cessation medication prescription 
19:472:39452:27:28:71:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:fills and refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults was 250 per quarter in expansion states and 208 
19:473:39549:28:27:71:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:per quarter in non-expansion states.  While not identical, the two groups of states are generally 
19:474:39647:27:28:71:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:similar across observed characteristics.  However, there are some notable exceptions.  On 
19:475:39737:28:28:71:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:average, expansion states had higher tobacco cigarette taxes, more venue-specific smoking bans, 
19:476:39833:28:27:71:529:349:144:Times:144:Times:lower poverty rates, and more generous social policies (e.g., higher effective minimum wages) 
19:477:39927:27:28:71:455:322:144:Times:144:Times:and were more likely to have a Democrat governor than non-expansion states.

19:479:40017:27:28:107:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 1 provides graphical analysis of trends in cessation prescription medication fills 
19:480:40107:28:28:71:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:and refills over our study period.  We aggregate the data to the year-treatment level to smooth 
19:481:40203:28:27:71:541:211:144:Times:144:Times:out noise.  In 2011-2013, prescription fills and refills appear to have moved broadly in parallel in 
19:482:40304:27:28:71:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:the expansion and non-expansion states, which supports the hypothesis that the SDUD data 
19:483:40393:28:27:71:527:156:144:Times:144:Times:satisfy the parallel trends assumption.  However, in 2014-2015, we observe that the expansion 
19:484:40487:27:28:71:520:129:144:Times:144:Times:and non-expansion states appeared to follow different trends.  Overall, expansion states were 
19:485:40581:28:0:71:542:101:144:Times:144:Times:relatively stable in terms of the number of prescription fills and refills reimbursed by Medicaid in 
20:486:40685:0:28:72:493:709:144:Times:144:Times:the first and second year of the treatment, while non-expansion states appeared to trend 
20:487:40774:28:27:71:450:681:144:Times:144:Times:downwards in reimbursed fills and refills in the second year of the treatment.   
20:488:40854:27:28:108:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:We report regression-based parallel trends testing in the left-hand panel of Table 3.  We 
20:489:40944:28:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:cannot reject the null hypothesis that expansion states and non-expansion states followed similar 
20:490:41042:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:trends in prescription fills and refills in 2011-2013: 훾훾�1 is not statistically different from zero.  
20:491:41145:28:28:72:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, the estimate of 훾훾1 are is small and relatively precise, which allows us to rule out 
20:492:41240:28:28:72:541:542:144:Times:144:Times:moderate violations of the parallel trends assumption in 2011-2013.  In particular, the estimate of 
20:493:41340:28:28:72:453:514:144:g_d0_f8:144:Times:훾훾1 is 2, relative to a baseline mean of 250, and the standard error estimate is 2.

20:495:41446:27:28:107:530:459:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 (right-hand panel) reports our main DD results for our outcome variables.  Post 
20:496:41534:28:27:72:515:431:144:Times:144:Times:expansion, we find that expansion states experienced an increase of 89 prescription fills and 
20:497:41628:27:28:72:534:404:144:Times:144:Times:refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter relative to non-expansion states.  Compared to 
20:498:41726:28:28:72:529:376:144:Times:144:Times:the baseline mean in expansion states before expansion, this estimate reflects a 36% increase.   
20:499:41822:28:27:108:545:348:144:Times:144:Times:We also consider payments – total, Medicaid, and non-Medicaid – for these prescriptions.  
20:500:41912:27:28:72:506:321:144:Times:144:Times:As noted earlier in the manuscript, an important limitation of the SDUD is that it does not 
20:501:42004:28:27:72:540:293:144:Times:144:Times:include rebates that Medicaid programs receive from pharmaceutical companies.  This limitation 
20:502:42099:27:28:72:527:266:144:Times:144:Times:is particularly important if expanding Medicaid allowed expansion states to bargain for higher 
20:503:42194:28:28:72:523:238:144:Times:144:Times:rebates due to increased market power.  However, even given this data limitation, we contend 
20:504:42287:28:27:71:529:210:144:Times:144:Times:that this exercise is informative for studying whether Medicaid or patients carried the financial 
20:505:42385:27:28:71:482:183:144:Times:144:Times:responsibility for the increase in prescription medications documented in Table 3.22   
20:506:42472:28:27:108:512:155:144:Times:144:Times:Results are reported in Table 4; the top panel reports regression-based testing of the 
20:507:42559:27:30:72:543:128:144:Times:144:Times:parallel trends assumption while the bottom panel reports estimates generated in our DD models.  
20:508:42656:30:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
20:509:42714:9:15:72:540:89:42:Times:99:Times:22 For example, we contend that it is unlikely that expanding Medicaid allowed state Medicaid programs to negotiate 
20:510:42829:15:0:71:465:74:99:Times:99:Times:rebates from pharmaceutical companies that fully offset payments that we observe in the SDUD.   
21:511:42928:0:28:72:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:Total payments per quarter on these medications was $15,375 per 100,000 in expansion states.  
21:512:43022:28:27:72:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid paid the vast majority – 99% in expansion states– of the costs of FDA-approved 
21:513:43110:27:28:72:496:654:144:Times:144:Times:smoking cessation medications.  The financial responsibility of Medicaid is perhaps not 
21:514:43198:28:28:72:417:626:144:Times:144:Times:surprising as the program is characterized by low patient cost-sharing.   
21:515:43272:28:27:108:498:598:144:Times:144:Times:Results suggest that the SDUD satisfy the parallel trends assumption: coefficient 
21:516:43354:27:28:72:502:571:144:Times:144:Times:estimates in the top panel are small in magnitude and imprecise in the total and Medicaid 
21:517:43444:28:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:payments regressions.  We find evidence that non-Medicaid payments were increasing 2011-
21:518:43532:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:2013 in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, thus we are cautious when interpreting 
21:519:43630:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:DD results for this outcome.  However, we include state-specific linear time trends in our DD 
21:520:43724:28:27:72:415:460:144:Times:144:Times:models which can account for some (linear) differences in pre-trends.   
21:521:43796:27:28:108:519:433:144:Times:144:Times:Turning to estimates generated in our DD model, we observe that in expansion states 
21:522:43880:28:28:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:relative to non-expansion states, total payments on these medications per 100,000 per quarter 
21:523:43974:28:27:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:increased by $4,241, or 28% after the expansion.  Estimates for Medicaid payments are similar: 
21:524:44069:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:post expansion Medicaid payments rose by $4,295 per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter, or 
21:525:44164:28:27:72:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:28%, in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  The estimate in the non-Medicaid 
21:526:44257:27:28:72:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:payment regression is large in magnitude (-$54) but imprecise.  Collectively, our findings from 
21:527:44353:28:28:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:the SDUD show increased cessation prescription use among the newly insured and that the 
21:528:44441:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:newly insured were sheltered from bearing the full financial responsibility of these prescriptions. 
21:529:44541:27:28:108:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:There are two somewhat surprising findings generated in our payments analysis.  First, 
21:530:44628:28:27:72:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:the relative increase in total and Medicaid payments is greater than the relative increase in 
21:531:44722:27:28:72:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:prescriptions.  However, examination of the lower (upper) tail of the prescription medication 
21:532:44816:28:28:72:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:(total/Medicaid payment) 95% confidence interval suggests that the two sets of variables 
21:533:44905:28:0:72:497:101:144:Times:144:Times:experienced more analogous changes post-expansion in expanding states relative to non-
22:534:44994:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:expanding states.  The lower tail of the prescription medication 95% confidence interval suggests 
22:535:45092:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:a 21% increase and the upper tail of the total payments 95% confidence interval suggests a 49% 
22:536:45187:27:28:72:523:654:144:Times:144:Times:increase.  Thus, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that changes in prescriptions and payments 
22:537:45281:28:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:were comparable post-expansion.  Second, Medicaid payments increased by $54 more than total 
22:538:45373:28:27:72:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:payments.  95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlap, and therefore we cannot rule 
22:539:45467:27:28:72:464:571:144:Times:144:Times:out the possibility that total payments increased more than Medicaid payments.    
22:540:45549:28:28:72:265:543:144:Times:144:Times:5. Extensions and sensitivity analyses 
22:541:45588:28:27:72:528:515:144:Times:144:Times: We estimate several extensions to the main analyses and conduct sensitivity analyses.   
22:542:45676:27:28:72:232:488:144:Times:144:Times:5.1 Heterogeneity by medication 
22:543:45708:28:27:108:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:The three medications in our analyses vary in how much state Medicaid programs pay 
22:544:45791:27:28:72:495:433:144:Times:144:Times:pharmacies – the average cost for Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol is $42, $191, and $235, 
22:545:45878:28:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:respectively, per fill or refill in the SDUD during our study period.  The medications also have 
22:546:45975:28:27:72:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:different efficacy and side effects (Food and Drug Administration 2015).  Such differences may 
22:547:46070:27:28:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:lead to different effects of Medicaid expansion on prescriptions.  We next explore heterogeneity 
22:548:46166:28:27:71:500:322:144:Times:144:Times:by estimating separate regressions for each medication.  Results are reported in Table 5.  
22:549:46256:27:28:108:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:Before we proceed to our heterogeneity analysis, we provide suggestive evidence that the 
22:550:46345:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:SDUD can satisfy the parallel trends assumption for each cessation medication separately.  We 
22:551:46439:28:27:72:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the expansion states and non-expansion states 
22:552:46531:27:28:72:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:followed the same trend in these outcomes in the pre-expansion period.  Turning to our DD 
22:553:46621:28:27:72:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimates, we find that, post-expansion, Zyban prescription fills and refills increased 40% in 
22:554:46716:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  We find no statistically significant evidence 
22:555:46814:28:0:72:484:129:144:Times:144:Times:that prescription fills or refills for Chantix or Nicotrol increased in expansion states.   
23:556:46909:0:28:108:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:While our data do not allow us to explore the reasons behind the differential effects by 
23:557:46998:28:27:72:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:cessation medication type, there are several possible reasons for this pattern of results.  First, 
23:558:47097:27:28:72:512:654:144:Times:144:Times:newly eligible smoking patients may be directed, perhaps through the use of differential co-
23:559:47189:28:28:71:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:payments or other forms of utilization management, toward less costly medications (Zyban) and 
23:560:47283:28:27:71:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:away from more expensive medications (Chantix and Nictorol).  Given the clinical literature 
23:561:47375:27:28:71:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:does not suggest that these medications differ substantially in terms of their efficacy, this pattern 
23:562:47477:28:28:71:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:of results could imply that the newly eligible are being treated in a cost-effective manner.  
23:563:47571:28:27:71:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:Second, despite our efforts to focus on Zyban for smoking cessation rather than bupropion for 
23:564:47665:27:28:71:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:depression, it is possible that some of the increase in our Zyban measure reflects it is use as an 
23:565:47764:28:27:71:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:antidepressant (Maclean et al. 2017).  Other possibilities include patient preferences, provider 
23:566:47861:27:28:71:407:433:144:Times:144:Times:preferences for, or knowledge of, medications, or some other factor.   
23:567:47932:28:28:71:148:405:144:Times:144:Times:5.2 Event study 
23:568:47948:28:27:107:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:We estimate an event study to explore the possibility of policy endogeneity (Autor 2003).  
23:569:48039:27:28:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:More specifically, we augment Equation (1) with a series interactions between period indicators 
23:570:48135:28:27:71:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:for Q1 2011 through Q4 2015, and an indicator for expansion states (policy leads and lags).  Q4 
23:571:48231:27:28:71:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:2013 is the omitted period in the event study.  We omit the state-specific linear time trends 
23:572:48325:28:28:71:492:267:144:Times:144:Times:following Wolfers (2006).  We exclude states with substantial expansions before 2011. 
23:573:48410:28:27:107:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:We report event study results graphically in Figure 2; specific coefficient and standard 
23:574:48499:27:28:71:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:error estimates are reported in Appendix Table 1.  The event study findings are in line with 
23:575:48592:28:27:71:498:184:144:Times:144:Times:estimates generated in the DD regression models.  The coefficient estimates are small in 
23:576:48680:27:28:71:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude and generally imprecise (95% confidence intervals include zero) before 2014.  
23:577:48768:28:28:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:Coefficients become positive and precise in Q1 2014, and increase in magnitude over time.  The 
23:578:48863:28:0:71:524:101:144:Times:144:Times:increasing effect sizes in the post-period are in line with the hypothesis that patients are better 
24:579:48966:0:28:72:536:709:144:Times:144:Times:able to access services over time, perhaps as they become aware of their benefits and/or are able 
24:580:49064:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:to navigate the healthcare delivery system (e.g., enroll in Medicaid, locate a physician, schedule 
24:581:49163:27:28:72:530:654:144:Times:144:Times:an appointment, and fill a prescription).23  These increasing effect sizes over time suggests that 
24:582:49262:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:cessation will also increases as time passes.  Given that the ACA Medicaid literature on smoking 
24:583:49359:28:27:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:effects is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Courtemanche et al. 2017a), our 
24:584:49449:27:28:72:499:571:144:Times:144:Times:findings for a mechanism through which insurance may affect smoking is informative.    
24:585:49536:28:28:72:142:543:144:Times:144:Times:5.3 Weighting 
24:586:49550:28:27:108:502:515:144:Times:144:Times:There is controversy as to whether weighting is appropriate in studies that seek to 
24:587:49634:27:28:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:estimate causal effects (Angrist and Pischke 2009, Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge 2015).  Given 
24:588:49729:28:27:72:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:this controversy, we re-estimate Equation (1) using population weights; we weight the 
24:589:49815:27:28:72:531:433:144:Times:144:Times:regressions with the population ages 18 to 64 in each state.  Results are reported in Table 6 and 
24:590:49913:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:are not appreciably different from the unweighted results generated in our core model (Table 3).   
24:591:50011:28:27:72:405:377:144:Times:144:Times:5.4 Counselling services and over-the-counter cessation medications 
24:592:50079:27:28:108:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:Over time states have increasingly covered smoking cessation counseling (Singleterry et 
24:593:50167:28:27:72:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:al. 2014); which may change the use of cessation medications, either by substituting for or 
24:594:50259:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:encouraging medication adherence.  Moreover, Medicaid expansion plans include coverage for 
24:595:50350:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:OTC FDA-approved NRTs.  Thus, our analysis may be vulnerable to omitted variable bias as we 
24:596:50442:28:27:72:314:239:144:Times:144:Times:do not control for these related covered services.   
24:597:50494:27:28:107:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:We re-estimate Equation (1) including an indicator variable for whether a state-year-
24:598:50579:28:63:71:519:184:144:Times:144:Times:quarter covers counselling services (individual or group) or at least one FDA-approved OTC 
24:599:50670:63:9:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
24:600:50728:9:15:72:541:112:42:Times:99:Times:23 We note that another common concern in policy analyses is program induced migration.  That is, some individuals 
24:601:50843:15:11:71:515:97:99:Times:99:Times:may migrate from non-expansion states to expansion states and such behavior will bias regression coefficients 
24:602:50953:11:12:71:536:86:99:Times:99:Times:(Moffitt 1992).  To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that the ACA Medicaid expansions induced this 
24:603:51067:12:0:71:304:74:99:Times:99:g_d0_f5:type of cross-state migration behavior (Goodman 2017).   
25:604:51126:0:28:72:518:709:144:Times:144:Times:NRT (nicotine gum, lozenge, or patch).  Table 7 reports results: coefficient estimates are not 
25:605:51221:28:27:72:343:681:144:Times:144:Times:appreciably different from our core findings (Table 3).   
25:606:51279:27:28:108:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:To dig deeper into the importance of OTC NRTs, we re-estimate Equation (1) using the 
25:607:51364:28:28:72:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:above-noted FDA-approved OTC NRTs as variables analogous to our prescription medication 
25:608:51452:28:27:71:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:variables.24  We examine common OTC NRTs (e.g., Nicoderm, Nicorette, generic brands for 
25:609:51539:27:28:72:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:national box stores such as Walmart’s brand Equate) using the method outlined in Section 3.1.  
25:610:51634:28:28:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:Results are reported in Table 8.  We also report regression-based testing of the parallel trends 
25:611:51730:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:assumption in the left-hand panel of Table 8; this analysis suggests that the OTC data are able to 
25:612:51829:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:satisfy this assumption.  Turning to our DD estimates (right-hand panel), we find no statistically 
25:613:51928:28:27:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:significant evidence that OTC NRT prescriptions fills and refills increased post expansion.   
25:614:52022:27:28:107:526:433:144:Times:144:Times:It is surprising that we find increases in prescription medications but no corresponding 
25:615:52111:28:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:increases in the OTC NRTs post-expansion.  We propose possible reasons.  (i) OTC NRTs tend 
25:616:52202:28:27:72:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:to be less expensive than prescription medications and OTC NRTs may be more affordable to 
25:617:52292:27:28:72:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:uninsured smokers seeking to quit, but when prescription medication out-of-pocket prices 
25:618:52381:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:decline with Medicaid coverage smokers switch to the latter, more expensive, product.25  (ii) 
25:619:52475:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:Many states offered OTC NRTs for free or at a heavy discount pre-ACA (Cummins et al. 2007) 
25:620:52566:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:and uninsured smokers may have relied on these discounts pre-expansion and may continue to 
25:621:52657:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:obtain NRTs outside Medicaid.  (iii) The clinical literature suggests that prescription medications 
25:622:52757:27:28:72:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:are more efficacious than OTC NRTs, thus newly insured smokers (perhaps in combination with 
25:623:52849:28:40:72:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:healthcare providers) wishing to quit their smoking addiction may simply be selecting the

25:625:52997:9:15:72:534:135:42:Times:99:Times:24 Medicaid programs typically require a prescription for OTC NRTs, hence we are able to study these medications 
25:626:53110:15:12:72:517:120:99:Times:99:Times:in the SDUD.  For example, see the New York (https://www.nysmokefree.com/subpage.aspx?pn=medications;

26:632:53614:28:27:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:while the standard error estimates are relatively large, thus we cannot definitively rule out the 
26:633:53712:27:28:72:399:654:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis that OTC NRT prescriptions increased post-expansion.   
26:634:53778:28:28:72:263:626:144:Times:144:Times:5.5 Utilization management techniques 
26:635:53816:28:27:108:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:The ACA did not regulate state Medicaid program use of utilization management 
26:636:53894:27:28:72:530:571:144:Times:144:Times:techniques.  According to the CDC (2016), the most common forms of utilization management 
26:637:53984:28:28:72:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:are copayments, annual duration limits, and prior authorization.  There is concern among 
26:638:54073:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:healthcare scholars that such techniques may offset expansion effects (McAfee et al. 2015).  To 
26:639:54169:27:28:72:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:explore this possibility, we estimate a variant of Equation (1) that includes an indicator that takes 
26:640:54271:28:27:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:on a value of one if the state applies one of the above-noted utilization management techniques, 
26:641:54368:27:28:72:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:and zero otherwise.  Results (Table 9) are not appreciably different from our core findings (Table 
26:642:54467:28:27:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:3), and suggest that utilization management techniques do not offset expansion effects.26,27 
26:643:54559:27:28:71:157:378:144:Times:144:Times:5.6 Primary care 
26:644:54575:28:28:107:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:A concern among policy makers is that, post-expansion, the newly eligible will not be 
26:645:54661:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:able to access primary care given difficulties, pre-ACA, faced by Medicaid patients in accessing 
26:646:54758:27:28:71:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:this type of care (Decker 2012).  To explore the importance of access to primary care, where 
26:647:54851:28:28:71:492:267:144:Times:144:Times:many of the prescriptions that we study here likely originate, we next estimate separate 
26:648:54940:28:27:71:481:239:144:Times:144:Times:regressions for states with relatively high and relatively low access to primary care.   
26:649:55028:27:28:107:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:We combine data from the Area Resource File (ARF) on the number of physicians 
26:650:55106:28:29:71:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:delivering primary care and data from CMS on the number of Medicaid enrollees in each state to

26:652:55259:8:16:72:533:147:42:Times:99:Times:26 In unreported analyses we have used different coding schemes for utilization management and the results, which 
26:653:55373:16:8:71:294:131:99:Times:99:Times:are available on request, are not appreciably different.   
26:654:55431:8:15:72:533:123:42:Times:99:Times:27 Using data from the CDC STATE system, we have explored the extent to which expansion states have complied 
26:655:55540:15:11:71:541:108:99:Times:99:Times:with the ACA cessation medication regulation that, post January 1st 2014, Medicaid must cover all three medications 
26:656:55656:11:11:72:538:97:99:Times:99:Times:that we study here.  Overall, states appear to be broadly in compliance with this requirement.  However, we did find 
26:657:55773:11:12:72:541:86:99:Times:99:Times:evidence that several states were not fully compliant (i.e., did not cover all medications).  In unreported analyses, we 
26:658:55894:12:0:72:499:74:99:Times:99:Times:excluded non-compliant states from the analysis sample.  Results are robust and are available on request.   
27:659:56005:0:28:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:construct the ratio of physicians who might be delivering patient care to Medicaid enrollees.  We 
27:660:56103:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:classify states as ‘high access’ (at or above the median value of the primary physician-Medicaid 
27:661:56200:27:28:71:528:654:144:Times:144:Times:enrollee ratio for the nation) or ‘low access’ (below the median value of the primary physician-
27:662:56296:28:28:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid enrollee ratio for the nation).  We use ARF and CMS data from 2010, in advance of the 
27:663:56391:28:27:71:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid expansions we study, to avoid stratifying the sample based on an endogenous variable 
27:664:56485:27:28:71:391:571:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e., the number of enrollees).28  Results are reported in Table 10. 
27:665:56555:28:27:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times: We find similar effects (i.e., when comparing coefficient estimates to the pre-expansion 
27:666:56644:27:28:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:means) in the low access sample than the high access sample.  This is in line with Abdus and Hill 
27:667:56742:28:28:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:(2017) who find no evidence of negative spillovers of the expansions on insured populations.   
27:668:56837:28:27:72:274:460:144:Times:144:Times:5.7 Isolating effects for the newly eligible 
27:669:56881:27:28:108:532:433:144:Times:144:Times:A limitation of the SDUD data, similar to many survey and administrative datasets used 
27:670:56968:28:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:to study ACA Medicaid expansions, is that the data do not include information on patients to 
27:671:57061:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:allow separation of the newly eligible from other Medicaid enrollees.  We explore effects in 
27:672:57154:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:different specifications and samples to tease out effects among newly eligible enrollees.  Each of 
27:673:57253:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:these extensions is subject to important limitations, which we outline below.  We argue that 
27:674:57346:27:28:72:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:considering results generated in these extensions collectively is informative for thinking through 
27:675:57445:28:28:72:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:the extent to which we can interpret our main estimates (Table 3) as reflecting effects for the 
27:676:57541:28:27:72:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:newly eligible or some combination of groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related 
27:677:57631:27:28:72:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:changes; i.e., newly eligible populations, previously eligible populations that enrolled in 
27:678:57723:28:27:72:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid due to welcome mat effects, and populations that become eligible for Medicaid due to 
27:679:57817:27:59:72:238:157:144:Times:144:Times:changes in the income disregard.   
27:680:57852:59:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
27:681:57910:9:15:72:523:89:42:Times:99:Times:28 We note that the number of physicians is also potentially endogenous to the expansions we study.  Indeed, the 
27:682:58023:15:0:71:504:74:99:Times:99:Times:ACA allocated resources toward increasing healthcare workforce and infrastructure (Abdus and Hill 2017). 
28:683:58131:0:28:108:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:Our first approach to minimize contamination from welcome-mat and income disregard 
28:684:58214:28:27:71:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:effects is to estimate a triple-difference style estimator to isolate effects for the newly eligible.  
28:685:58317:27:28:71:526:654:144:Times:144:Times:We augment Equation (1) with a three-way interaction between an indicator for the expansion 
28:686:58409:28:28:71:489:626:144:Times:144:Times:period, the post period (this varies across states depending on when the state expanded 
28:687:58497:28:27:71:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid), and the newly eligible as a percent of increased enrollment.  We define the newly 
28:688:58590:27:31:71:526:571:144:Times:144:Times:eligible share of increased enrollment between 2013 and each period in the following manner:

28:693:58866:29:28:72:536:477:144:Times:144:Times:number of enrollees in state s in time t, and 푇푇푇푇푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠,2013 is the total number of enrollees in state s 
28:694:58972:28:28:72:527:449:144:Times:144:Times:in 2013.  This variable is coded as zero in all years prior to expansion for expansion states and 
28:695:59070:28:28:72:537:421:144:Times:144:Times:for non-expansion states in all periods.  We constrain 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 to lie between 0% and 100% in 
28:696:59174:28:27:72:524:393:144:Times:144:Times:all years.29  We exclude early expanding states from this analysis.30  The Medicaid expansion 
28:697:59268:27:28:72:515:366:144:Times:144:Times:indicator captures the effect of Medicaid expansion on all Medicaid enrollees other than the 
28:698:59361:28:28:72:528:338:144:Times:144:Times:newly eligible (welcome mat and income disregard) and the three-way interaction captures the 
28:699:59454:28:28:72:529:310:144:Times:144:Times:effect for the newly eligible.  We do not include the main effect for 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 as it is collinear 
28:700:59562:28:28:72:540:282:144:Times:144:Times:with other variables in the regression.  A limitation of this analysis is that the 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 variable 
28:701:59673:28:27:72:535:254:144:Times:144:Times:is likely influenced by Medicaid expansion, hence results generated in this specification may be 
28:702:59770:27:71:72:531:227:144:Times:144:Times:vulnerable to over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).  We report results in Table 11.  
28:703:59867:71:9:72:217:156:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
28:704:59925:9:16:72:517:147:42:Times:99:Times:29 We set 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 to zero for a few states that had declines in total enrollment, perhaps due to the improving 
28:705:60047:16:11:71:518:131:99:Times:99:Times:economy over the study period.  We capped 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 at 100%, because, in readily available CMS enrollment 
28:706:60162:11:12:71:531:120:99:Times:99:Times:summaries, early expansion enrollees were reclassified in 2014 as ‘newly eligible,’ making it appear as though the 
28:707:60277:12:8:71:264:108:99:Times:99:Times:newly eligible grew more than total enrollment. 
28:708:60324:8:14:72:518:100:42:Times:99:Times:30 Including these states in the analysis does not alter our results appreciably (results available on request).  We 
28:709:60441:14:12:71:529:86:99:Times:99:Times:chose to exclude these variables as they did enroll newly eligible prior to January 1st, 2014 but our data source for 
28:710:60559:12:0:72:433:74:99:Times:99:Times:enrollees (CMS) began tracking enrollment by newly eligible status in January 1st,  2014.   
29:711:60653:0:28:108:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:The interaction between the expansion indicator and post is not statistically different from 
29:712:60746:28:27:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:zero in this specification; the confidence interval is quite wide and thus we cannot rule out 
29:713:60840:27:28:72:505:654:144:Times:144:Times:increases in prescriptions for the non-newly eligible Medicaid populations.  However, the 
29:714:60930:28:28:72:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on the three-way interaction is positive and precise.  To interpret this coefficient 
29:715:61027:28:28:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:estimate, we multiply it by the mean value of 푃푃푇푇푇푇푃푃푇푇퐸퐸푇푇푠푠푠푠 in the post-period among expansion 
29:716:61127:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:states (82.85%).  We find that, post-expansion, prescriptions among newly eligible populations 
29:717:61222:27:28:72:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:increased by 90 per 100,000 non-elderly residents each quarter (36%).  This estimate is very 
29:718:61315:28:28:72:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:similar to that estimated in our main specification (Table 3; an increase of 89 prescriptions per 
29:719:61413:28:27:72:539:487:144:Times:144:Times:quarter or 36%).  We interpret these results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable 
29:720:61514:27:28:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:to increases in prescriptions among the newly eligible.  This pattern is in line with findings for 
29:721:61613:28:27:72:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:primary care visits (Biener, Zuvekas, and Hill 2017), a setting in which cessation medication 
29:722:61707:27:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:prescriptions are likely to be written.  The authors show that, post-expansion, primary care visits 
29:723:61807:28:28:72:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:increased among newly-eligibles but such visits were not altered among previously eligibles. 
29:724:61900:28:27:108:531:349:144:Times:144:Times:As a second approach, we re-estimate Equation (1) in for prescriptions financed by MC 
29:725:61986:27:28:72:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:plans and FFS Medicaid plans separately.  Interviews with state Medicaid program directors 
29:726:62077:28:27:72:535:294:144:Times:144:Times:reveal that most newly eligibles are enrolled in MC plans while traditional populations are more 
29:727:62174:27:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:likely to be enrolled in FFS plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016).  
29:728:62266:28:28:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:We argue that separating the data in this manner can allow us to provide estimates for samples 
29:729:62361:28:27:72:494:211:144:Times:144:Times:that better reflect the newly eligible and other populations that enrolled in Medicaid.  A 
29:730:62452:27:28:72:506:184:144:Times:144:Times:limitation of this extension is that there is not a perfect correlation between newly eligible 
29:731:62547:28:27:72:529:156:144:Times:144:Times:enrollees and Medicaid plan (MC vs. FFS); i.e., there are obviously newly eligibles enrolled in 
29:732:62642:27:28:72:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:FFS plans, and previously eligibles and individuals who became eligible due to changes in the 
29:733:62736:28:0:72:503:101:144:Times:144:Times:income disregard enrolled in MC plans.  We are simply relying on the fact that the newly 
30:734:62828:0:28:72:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:eligibles are much more likely to enroll in MC plans based on reports by state Medicaid program 
30:735:62924:28:27:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:directors.  For the analysis of MC plans we include only those state/year pairs that have MC data 
30:736:63022:27:28:72:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:appearing in the SDUD (not all states have MC programs in all years of our study period) and we 
30:737:63118:28:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:exclude the four expansion states that do not use MC for newly eligibles during our study period 
30:738:63215:28:27:72:318:598:144:Times:144:Times:(Arkansas, Connecticut, Montana, and Vermont).   
30:739:63263:27:28:108:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:Results are reported in Table 12.  The MC sample produces an estimate very similar to 
30:740:63349:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:our main estimates although relative effect size is  larger (Table 3).  In particular, post-expansion, 
30:741:63452:28:27:72:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:the number of quarterly prescription fills and refills in MC plans increased by 62 (55%) in 
30:742:63544:27:28:72:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:expansion states relative to non-expansion states.31  In terms of the FFS sample, we find no 
30:743:63637:28:27:72:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant evidence that prescriptions financed by FFS Medicaid increased in 
30:744:63729:27:28:72:534:433:144:Times:144:Times:expanding states relative to non-expansion states.  The effect size (both absolute and relative) is 
30:745:63829:28:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:smaller in the FFS sample than the MC sample.  We interpret these findings to suggest that our 
30:746:63924:28:27:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:main DD estimates primarily capture effects for the newly eligible and not other groups that 
30:747:64017:27:28:72:323:350:144:Times:144:Times:enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related changes.   
30:748:64068:28:27:107:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, we attempt to remove effects attributable those enrollees who became eligible 
30:749:64155:27:28:71:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:due to the five percentage point increase in the income thresholds for both expansion and non-
30:750:64249:28:27:71:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:expansion states.  This policy change occurred January 1st, 2014 for all states.  Hence, for states 
30:751:64349:27:28:72:516:240:144:Times:144:Times:that expanded Medicaid on January 1st, 2014, Medicaid expansion and the income disregard 
30:752:64438:28:28:72:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:increase are perfectly collinear.  To separate these two effects, we re-estimate Equation (1) 
30:753:64532:28:27:72:541:184:144:Times:144:Times:excluding all states that expanded January 1st, 2014 and early expansion states (see Table 1).  We 
30:754:64631:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:exclude the early expansion states as, while these states did have major Medicaid expansions 
30:755:64724:28:31:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:prior to the ACA-related expansions we study, the ACA expansion substantially increased the 
30:756:64816:31:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
30:757:64874:9:15:72:503:89:42:Times:99:Times:31 The relative effect size is larger as the baseline number of prescription fills and refills is lower in the MC 
30:758:64988:15:0:71:358:74:99:Times:99:Times:Medicaid-financed sample than in the overall sample of prescriptions.   
31:759:65063:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:number of individuals eligible for Medicaid.  Excluding these states allows us to recover effects 
31:760:65161:28:27:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:for the newly eligible from effects for those individuals who became eligible due to the income 
31:761:65257:27:28:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:disregard.  However, an important limitation of this approach is that we leverage variation from 
31:762:65354:28:28:72:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:the relatively small number of late expanding states (see Table 1).  We interpret findings from 
31:763:65450:28:27:72:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:this analysis cautiously, and encourage readers to do the same, as the findings could be 
31:764:65539:27:28:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:attributable to unique attributes of the late expanding states rather than Medicaid expansion.   
31:765:65636:28:28:108:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:Results from this analysis are reported in Table 13.  The estimated effects suggest that, 
31:766:65726:28:27:72:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:post-expansion, quarterly prescription medications increased by 53 per 100,000 non-elderly 
31:767:65817:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:adults in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  The 95% confidence intervals for this 
31:768:65917:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:point estimate and our main point estimate (Table 3; 89) overlap.  We interpret the similarity in 
31:769:66015:27:28:72:533:433:144:Times:144:Times:the point estimates to imply that our main findings are largely attributable to the newly eligible. 
31:770:66114:28:28:108:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:In summary, while our data (administrative prescription counts) do not allow us to isolate 
31:771:66205:28:27:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:those patients who became eligible due to the Medicaid expansions, findings from estimates 
31:772:66296:27:28:72:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:generated in different specifications and samples collectively suggests that our estimates are not 
31:773:66395:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:fully attributable to groups other than the newly eligible.  These methods could be applied in 
31:774:66490:27:28:72:421:295:144:Times:144:Times:other data sets that lack detailed income and demographic information.   
31:775:66563:28:28:72:361:267:144:Times:144:Times:5.8 States with no change in cessation medication coverage 
31:776:66622:28:27:108:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:The ACA required that all states cover FDA-approved smoking cessation medications.  
31:777:66706:27:28:71:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:For states that did not cover these services prior to this Act, continuously enrolled traditional 
31:778:66804:28:27:71:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid populations in expansion and non-expansion states gained coverage.  Thus, our DD 
31:779:66894:27:28:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:estimates may reflect the combined effects of Medicaid expansion to newly eligible enrollees 
31:780:66986:28:28:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:and cessation service coverage gains among the continuously enrolled.  To isolate newly eligible 
31:781:67083:28:0:72:488:101:144:Times:144:Times:effects we estimate Equation (1) excluding states that changed coverage for any of the 
32:782:67173:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:medications we examine during our study period using data from Centers for Disease Control 
32:783:67264:28:27:72:200:681:144:Times:144:Times:and Prevention (2016).32   
32:784:67291:27:28:108:530:654:144:Times:144:Times:Results are reported in Table 14.  Estimates generated in this sample are very similar to 
32:785:67381:28:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:our main results (Table 3): post expansion, quarterly prescription fills and refills increase by 72 
32:786:67481:28:27:72:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:per 100,000 or 28% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.  We interpret these 
32:787:67574:27:28:72:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable to increases in enrollment, rather 
32:788:67673:28:28:72:231:543:144:Times:144:Times:than improvements in coverage.  
32:789:67704:28:27:72:303:515:144:Times:144:Times:5.9 Controlling for between-state heterogeneity 
32:790:67751:27:28:108:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:In our primary specification, we control for between-state heterogeneity through the 
32:791:67836:28:27:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:inclusion of time-varying state-level variables, states fixed effects, and state-specific linear time 
32:792:67938:27:28:72:518:433:144:Times:144:Times:trends.  While this specification is standard in policy analyses (Angrist and Pischke 2009), it 
32:793:68034:28:28:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:does impose assumptions on the nature of between-state heterogeneity.  For example, state-
32:794:68124:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:specific linear time trends can account for state-level unobservables that vary in a linear manner 
32:795:68223:27:28:72:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:over time but the true trends in such unobservables may not be linear.  On the other hand, if there 
32:796:68323:28:27:72:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:are no important time-varying state-level variables, including these time trends ‘throws away’ 
32:797:68418:27:28:72:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:variation that can be used for identification of treatment effects.  Further, some of our time-
32:798:68513:28:28:72:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:varying state-level controls may be outcomes of Medicaid expansion, suggesting that our 
32:799:68601:28:27:72:423:239:144:Times:144:Times:estimates suffer from over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).   
32:800:68674:27:28:108:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:To explore the robustness of our findings to different specifications, we next estimate 
32:801:68762:28:27:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:variants of Equation (1) that sequentially exclude state-specific linear time trends, exclude time-
32:802:68861:27:28:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:varying state-level controls, and include state-specific quadratic time trends.  Results are reported 
32:803:68963:28:31:71:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:in Table 15 and are in line with estimates generated in our main specification.  Indeed, 95% 
32:804:69056:31:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
32:805:69114:9:15:72:515:89:42:Times:99:Times:32 Excluded states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, 
32:806:69223:15:0:71:418:74:99:Times:99:Times:Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia.   
33:807:69309:0:28:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:confidence intervals of all point estimates in Table 15 include the point estimate generated in our 
33:808:69409:28:27:72:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:primary specification (Table 3, 89).  Not surprisingly, coefficients are generally smaller in 
33:809:69503:27:28:72:416:654:144:Times:144:Times:specifications that offer more control for between-state heterogeneity.   
33:810:69577:28:28:72:364:626:144:Times:144:Times:5.10 Alternative coding of ACA-related Medicaid expansion 
33:811:69634:28:27:108:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:We next report the robustness of our results to alternative approaches to coding ACA-
33:812:69719:27:28:72:535:571:144:Times:144:Times:related Medicaid expansion.  First, we adopt the coding of early expansion states in Sommers et 
33:813:69815:28:28:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:al. (2013) and Maclean and Saloner (2017); second we code states with substantial Medicaid 
33:814:69906:28:27:71:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:prior to our study period (early expansion states in Table 1) as expanding January 1st, 2014 in the 
33:815:70006:27:28:72:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:spirit of Courtemanche et al. (2017b); third we exclude states with substantial Medicaid 
33:816:70095:28:27:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:expansions prior to our study period from the analysis sample following sensitivity analyses 
33:817:70188:27:28:72:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:outlined by Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017);33 and fourth we 
33:818:70278:28:28:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:exclude California as this state has the largest number of Medicaid enrollees (University of 
33:819:70371:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) and we wish to ensure that our findings are 
33:820:70465:27:28:72:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:not driven by one specific state.  Results are reported in Table 16.  While the point estimates do 
33:821:70564:28:27:72:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:vary across the various coding schemes, 95% confidence intervals for all specifications include 
33:822:70660:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:our primary point estimate (89; Table 3) and we interpret these findings to imply that our results 
33:823:70759:28:28:72:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:are not sensitive to the use of different approaches to coding ACA-related Medicaid expansion.   
33:824:70855:28:27:72:141:239:144:Times:144:Times:6. Discussion 
33:825:70868:27:28:72:518:212:144:Times:144:Times: In this study we offer new evidence on the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) 
33:826:70952:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid expansions, specifically we examine the use of prescription medications for smoking 
33:827:71045:27:36:72:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:cessation.  The ACA-related expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 27% (Gates et al. 
33:828:71135:36:9:72:217:121:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f5:                                                           
33:829:71193:9:15:72:512:112:42:Times:99:Times:33 This check excludes Massachusetts, which implemented a large-scale healthcare reform in 2006 that shares 
33:830:71301:15:11:72:511:97:99:Times:99:Times:similarities with the ACA (Gruber 2008) and included smoking-cessation medications coverage for Medicaid 
33:831:71406:11:12:71:536:86:99:Times:99:Times:enrollees (Land et al. 2010).  Thus, we also explore the possibility that our main point estimates are partially driven 
33:832:71526:12:0:71:255:74:99:Times:99:Times:by a previous large-scale healthcare reform.   
34:833:71576:0:28:72:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:2016), and 38% of this population may smoke (DiGiulio et al. 2016).  The expansions were 
34:834:71665:28:27:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:therefore targeted at a group of adults with a high rate of uninsurance and smoking risk, and 
34:835:71758:27:28:72:512:654:144:Times:144:Times:included a generous set of cessation medications.  Our findings imply that, post-expansion, 
34:836:71850:28:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:cessation medication fills and refills for which Medicaid was a third-party payer increased 36% 
34:837:71946:28:27:72:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, and this change was primarily driven by 
34:838:72040:27:28:72:513:571:144:Times:144:Times:increased prescriptions for Zyban.  Zyban is the least expensive prescription medication we 
34:839:72132:28:28:72:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:study, which suggests that the newly eligible were being treated in a cost-effective manner, as 
34:840:72228:28:27:72:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:the medications we study have similar efficacy.  We provide evidence that this estimate is 
34:841:72319:27:28:72:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:predominately driven by the newly eligible population and not other groups that enrolled in 
34:842:72411:28:27:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid with the broader ACA roll-out, nor improvements in coverage of prescription cessation 
34:843:72506:27:28:72:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:products among populations continuously enrolled Medicaid over our study period (2011-2015).  
34:844:72600:28:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:Increased prescriptions were financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients.  Dynamic 
34:845:72692:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:models suggest that prescriptions increased over time.  Finally, and re-assumingly, our estimates 
34:846:72790:27:28:72:327:350:144:Times:144:Times:are stable across numerous sensitivity checks.  
34:847:72836:28:27:108:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:We can compare our findings with previous ACA Medicaid studies that examine 
34:848:72912:27:28:72:498:295:144:Times:144:Times:smoking.  While Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) provide evidence that ACA Medicaid 
34:849:72994:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:expansions reduced smoking by 6% among childless adults, Courtemanche et al. (2017a) find no 
34:850:73087:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that smoking declined post-expansion among childless adults or any other population.  
34:851:73182:27:28:72:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:Given that the effect of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking remains unsettled, our study of 
34:852:73274:28:27:72:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:cessation medications is particularly timely and offers new evidence on this question.  Cessation 
34:853:73372:27:28:71:498:157:144:Times:144:Times:takes time with the average smoker attempting to quit roughly 30 times before obtaining 
34:854:73460:28:28:71:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:abstinence (Chaiton et al. 2016).   If increased use of prescription medications is a principle 
34:855:73556:28:0:72:532:101:144:Times:144:Times:mechanism through which expansions affect smoking, then – prior to changes in smoking – we 
35:856:73650:0:28:72:518:709:144:Times:144:Times:would expect to see changes in medications.  Given that we document increases in cessation 
35:857:73741:28:27:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:medication fills and refills that accelerated over time, our findings suggest that we may expect 
35:858:73838:27:28:72:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:more definitive evidence that smoking has declined in expansion states as more post-expansion 
35:859:73932:28:28:72:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:data becomes available.  Thus, our use of prescriptions facilitates better understanding of the 
35:860:74028:28:27:72:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:mechanisms related to ACA Medicaid expansions and behavioral response of lower income 
35:861:74114:27:28:72:499:571:144:Times:144:Times:smokers with little experience with the healthcare delivery system who seek to quit their 
35:862:74204:28:28:72:511:543:144:Times:144:Times:smoking addiction.  Finally, regardless of whether or not ACA Medicaid expansions affect 
35:863:74293:28:27:72:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:smoking in the short- or long-run, assessing the effects of these expansions on service use is 
35:864:74388:27:28:72:409:488:144:Times:144:Times:critical for understanding the overall value of this major policy shift.   
35:865:74463:28:27:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times: We can also compare our estimates to three recent studies that have explored the effect of 
35:866:74554:27:28:72:503:433:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid expansion on prescription medication claims.  Our finding of a 36% increase in 
35:867:74642:28:28:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid-financed smoking cessation medications is in the middle of estimates for the effect of 
35:868:74738:28:27:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:the Medicaid expansion on prescription medications in general and specific types of prescription 
35:869:74835:27:28:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:medications related to treatment of behavioral health outcomes.  Our finding is larger than an 
35:870:74930:28:27:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:increase of 19% found for all Medicaid-financed prescriptions (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 
35:871:75019:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:2017) and an increase of 22% identified for psychotropic medications (Maclean et al. 2017), but 
35:872:75115:28:28:72:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:less than a 70% increase found for prescription drugs used to treat opioid use disorders (Wen et 
35:873:75212:28:27:72:484:239:144:Times:144:Times:al. 2017).  Our estimate is comparable to a 43% increase found for all FDA-approved 
35:874:75296:27:28:72:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:medications used to treat alcohol and drug  use disorders (Maclean and Saloner 2017).   
35:875:75384:28:27:108:494:184:144:Times:144:Times:Although several studies suggest Medicaid expansions have led to reductions in 
35:876:75463:27:28:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:uninsurance, increased healthcare access and service use, improved health, and reduced financial 
35:877:75560:28:28:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:instability (Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Hu et al. 2016, Simon, Soni, and 
35:878:75654:28:0:72:481:101:144:Times:144:Times:Cawley 2017), the future direction of Medicaid is uncertain.  Our study suggests that 
36:879:75743:0:28:72:538:709:144:Times:144:Times:constraining Medicaid eligibility for the populations that gained access through the ACA-related 
36:880:75840:28:27:72:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:expansions may reduce the use of smoking cessation medications.  Reducing the use of such 
36:881:75930:27:28:72:519:654:144:Times:144:Times:medications may in turn increase the total economic costs of smoking, currently estimated at 
36:882:76023:28:28:72:407:626:144:Times:144:Times:$300B annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017).   
36:883:76091:28:27:108:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:In summary, our findings offer new evidence on the early effects of Medicaid expansions 
36:884:76179:27:28:72:538:571:144:Times:144:Times:on smokers.  In combination with previous analyses that have explored the effects of expansions 
36:885:76275:28:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:on other behavioral health outcomes, Medicaid expansions appear to have been associated with 
36:886:76368:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:increased access to evidence-based services to a particularly policy-relevant group: low-income 
36:887:76464:27:0:72:661:488:144:Times:144:Times:Americans who suffer from tobacco use, a chronic, addictive, costly, and harmful condition.
