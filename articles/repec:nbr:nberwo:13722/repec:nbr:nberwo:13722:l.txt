2:29:1450:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:This paper considers the factors responsible for differences with age in estimates of the wage compensation
2:30:1557:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:an individual requires to accept increased occupational fatality risk.  We derive a relationship between
2:31:1661:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:the value of a statistical life (VSL) and the degree of complementarity between consumption and labor
2:32:1762:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:supplied when health status serves as a potential source of variation in this relationship. Our empirical
2:33:1867:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:analysis finds that variations in an individual's health status or quality of life and anticipated longevity
2:34:1975:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:threats lead to significant differences in the estimated wage/risk tradeoffs. We describe how extensions
2:35:2079:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:to the specification of hedonic wage models, including measures for quality of life and anticipated
2:36:2178:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:longevity threats, help to explain the diversity in past studies examining how the estimated wage–risk

3:54:2672:27:28:89:168:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:I. Introduction 
3:55:2688:28:28:125:481:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:Recent research has identified how complementarity relationships help in 
3:56:2761:28:27:89:492:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:resolving some empirical puzzles in economics.  In the first of these papers, Chetty 
3:57:2846:27:28:89:508:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:[2006] develops an upper bound on the coefficient of relative risk aversion using labor 
3:58:2934:28:27:89:492:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:supply elasticities. His relationship implies that the bound varies with the degree of 
3:59:3021:27:28:89:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarity between consumption and labor supplied.  A second paper by Hall and 
3:60:3105:28:28:89:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Jones [2007] uses a form of complementarity to explain the rationality of an increasing 
3:61:3193:28:27:89:499:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:income share for health expenditures as incomes grow.  In particular, Hall and Jones 
3:62:3278:27:28:89:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:assume consumption goods and health services are weakly complementary.  We argue 
3:63:3359:28:27:89:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:that combining these two independent insights provides a possible explanation for yet 
3:64:3445:27:28:89:501:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:another puzzle largely associated with microeconomic applications—the relationship 
3:65:3528:28:27:89:489:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:between age and the marginal willingness to pay for risk reductions (the value of a 
3:66:3612:27:28:89:489:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistical life or VSL) and the diverse empirical findings from revealed preference 
3:67:3697:28:28:89:321:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies designed to examine this relationship.1   
3:68:3747:28:27:126:512:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:We use Chetty’s result to show that complementarity between consumption and 
3:69:3823:27:28:89:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor supply implies, in the absence of other considerations, a lower estimate for the 
3:70:3910:28:27:89:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of a statistical life than would be implied by models that assume independence. We 
3:71:3999:27:48:89:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesize that health status may well be a third influence on individual choice. That is, 
3:72:4091:48:8:234:237:109:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
3:73:4139:8:16:90:471:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 Chetty describes the logic for our proposed analysis as follows: “If complementarity between 
3:74:4234:16:11:89:517:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:consumption and labor is sufficiently strong, even highly risk averse individuals may choose not to reduce 
3:75:4341:11:0:89:484:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:labor supply when wages rise because increased consumption makes work less painful” (p.1821).  
4:76:4437:0:27:90:501:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:a person’s state of health may influence the extent of complementarity between labor 
4:77:4522:27:28:90:216:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:supply and consumption.  
4:78:4547:28:27:126:492:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:This logic is consistent in broad terms with the arguments in Hall and Jones 
4:79:4624:27:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:[2007] where health expenditures contribute to maintaining a health state.  Improvements 
4:80:4713:28:28:90:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:in health increase the value of leisure and change the types of goods consumed.  Thus, 
4:81:4800:28:27:90:519:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:improved health increases the demand for leisure and with it demands for a different mix 
4:82:4889:27:28:90:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:of consumption goods, which in turn reduces the apparent degree of complementarity 
4:83:4972:28:27:90:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:between labor supply and a fixed weight measure for aggregate consumption.  Thus, 
4:84:5054:27:28:90:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in the degree of complementarity between labor supply and consumption 
4:85:5136:28:28:90:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:among individuals with different health states offer one potential explanation for why we 
4:86:5226:28:27:90:486:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:might observe differences in estimated VSLs across individuals of different ages.  
4:87:5309:27:28:126:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, identifying the relationships among health status, complementarity, and 
4:88:5390:28:27:90:468:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated risk/wage tradeoffs helps to reconcile diverse findings regarding the 
4:89:5470:27:28:90:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship between age and the VSL in the revealed preference literature.  Viscusi and 
4:90:5559:28:27:90:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Aldy [2007] suggest lower VSL estimates among the older workers in their sample, with 
4:91:5645:27:28:90:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:a sample mean age of 39; Smith et al. [2004] fail to find lower VSL estimates for the 
4:92:5731:28:28:90:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:older workers in their sample, with a sample mean age of 55.  Neither analysis, however, 
4:93:5820:28:27:90:495:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls for differences in health status among workers.  If the distribution of health 
4:94:5908:27:28:90:508:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:status varies among those workers in the two samples, then this variation could help to 
4:95:5996:28:27:90:346:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:explain the observed differences in empirical results. 
4:96:6051:27:28:126:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper examines the effects of an individual’s health status or quality of life 
4:97:6135:28:28:90:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:as well as a person’s latent perceptions of his (or her) longevity on estimates of the VSL. 
4:98:6227:28:0:90:498:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our analysis considers a sample of older workers who participated in the Health and 
5:99:6312:0:27:90:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Retirement Study (HRS).2  We find these measures for quality and quantity remaining of 
5:100:6399:27:28:90:449:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:life influence the risk/wealth tradeoffs in ways that are consistent with our 
5:101:6477:28:27:90:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarity explanation.  Specifically, we exploit the panel dimension of the HRS to 
5:102:6566:27:28:90:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:define a measure of subjective quality of life based on a survey response given two years 
5:103:6656:28:28:90:479:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:before labor market choices are reported.  The motivation for our measure of the 
5:104:6737:28:27:89:493:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(subjective) quantity of life remaining stems from results in Smith et al. [2001] that 
5:105:6824:27:28:90:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest a respondent’s perceived longevity can be viewed as a latent variable from the 
5:106:6911:28:27:90:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyst’s perspective.  While this latent variable influences the other risks an individual 
5:107:7003:27:28:89:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:will assume, it is not completely reflected in subjective longevity assessments elicited at 
5:108:7095:28:28:89:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the time the labor market behavior is recorded.  Thus, we use a future death (or another 
5:109:7184:28:27:90:491:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:serious health condition) as an instrument for a respondent’s current perceptions of 
5:110:7269:27:28:90:484:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:personal longevity or as a subjective measure of the “quantity” of life remaining.  
5:111:7353:28:27:90:510:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Typically, the analyst is unable to take into account how these factors would affect risk 
5:112:7443:27:28:89:430:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:taking behaviors; the HRS panel structure allows us to consider them.  
5:113:7514:28:27:125:496:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:Section two provides a brief summary of the policy context for the questions 
5:114:7591:27:28:89:486:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with the sources of heterogeneity in risk preferences.  The third section 
5:115:7676:28:28:89:492:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:describes the theoretical logic that underlies the tests in our basic empirical model.  
5:116:7764:28:27:89:484:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section four summarizes our data and findings and the last section discusses their 
5:117:7847:27:28:89:157:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications.  
5:118:7862:28:27:89:182:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:II. Policy Context 
5:119:7881:27:28:125:511:157:144:Times:144:Times:A: In 2002, EPA’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the Clear Skies initiative 
5:120:7960:28:28:90:494:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [2002]) included an adjustment to the VSL 
5:121:8040:28:7:234:237:101:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
5:122:8088:7:16:90:510:94:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 The HRS (Health and Retirement Study) is sponsored by the National Institute of Aging (grant number 
5:123:8190:16:0:89:519:78:100:Times:100:Times:F:NIA U01AG09740) and conducted by the University of Michigan.  Where possible, we rely on the RAND 
6:124:8289:0:27:90:477:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates used to monetize the benefits from reduced risks experienced by older 
6:125:8369:27:28:90:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:populations. Specifically, the RIA included an estimate of the mortality benefits of the 
6:126:8458:28:27:90:489:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:proposed regulations using a VSL estimate discounted by approximately thirty-six 
6:127:8539:27:28:90:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent. The resulting controversy over this “senior discount” has affected subsequent 
6:128:8626:28:28:90:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy guidance, scientific reviews of the literature, and research.  For example, following 
6:129:8719:28:27:90:483:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:this controversy the Office of Management and Budget [2003] has suggested that 
6:130:8798:27:28:89:493:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory agencies consider the possibility of using cost effectiveness analysis and 
6:131:8884:28:27:89:470:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality adjusted life years to acknowledge that policies yield risk reductions to 
6:132:8966:27:28:89:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneous populations.  In a recent advisory letter to the EPA Administrator, the 
6:133:9052:28:28:89:491:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Environmental Economics Advisory Committee of EPA’s Science Advisory Board 
6:134:9127:28:27:89:477:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:(SAB) addressed the policy use of VSL estimates adjusted for differences in life 
6:135:9208:27:28:89:278:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectancy.  The letter concluded that: 
6:136:9248:28:14:125:489:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:“...The VSL may increase, decrease or remain constant as life expectancy 
6:137:9321:14:13:125:492:363:144:Times:144:Times:A:decreases.    The  relationship  between  the  VSL  and  life  expectancy  is  
6:138:9400:13:14:125:492:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:therefore  an  empirical  matter.  In  practice,  because  life  expectancy  is

6:140:9566:14:14:125:490:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:related  to  life  expectancy  –  namely  age  and  health  status.    Although  the

6:146:9900:14:27:126:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:This conclusion is important because there is a sharp contrast between summaries

6:150:10234:28:32:94:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:[2007b] conclude that the VSL varies with age and that there is sufficient information to

7:154:10646:0:27:94:507:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest “...VSL increases with age, peaks in mid-life, and subsequently declines” (p. 
7:155:10732:27:28:94:483:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:257).  By contrast, Krupnick [2007] concludes, based on his review of the stated 
7:156:10813:28:27:94:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:preference findings, that “...considering the weight of the evidence, the implication is 
7:157:10902:27:28:94:490:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that for countries that apply a single VSL to adults of all ages, there is insufficient 
7:158:10990:28:28:94:483:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:information and consensus to make a reasoned decision to switch to using either 
7:159:11070:28:27:94:495:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:different VSLs for different ages (in a private-good context) or a VSLY [value of a

7:161:11245:28:27:94:405:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:remaining and the VSL” (pp. 275-276, bracketed phrase added). 
7:162:11307:27:28:126:480:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:Even if the empirical issues could be resolved, a decision about how, in a 
7:163:11382:28:28:94:487:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:normative sense, to treat heterogeneity in risk preferences elicits a broad range of 
7:164:11467:28:27:94:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphatic (if not dramatic) responses.  The same SAB advisory letter we cited earlier 
7:165:11552:27:28:94:317:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:concludes its recommendations by noting that 
7:166:11596:28:14:126:490:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:“...while  there  is  no  denying  the  reality  of  income  effects,  it  is  a  policy

7:173:12020:28:28:126:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:Aldy and Viscusi [2007b] confirm the importance of these considerations using a 
7:174:12100:28:27:90:501:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:new set of estimates of the wage/risk tradeoffs that provide age-specific VSLs.  They 
7:175:12186:27:28:90:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:compare the benefit estimates for the Clear Skies Initiative derived using their age- and 
7:176:12276:28:27:90:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry-specific measures of the VSL to the estimates derived using the EPA’s constant, 
7:177:12365:27:28:90:499:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:consensus VSL estimate.  Their results suggest about a forty percent reduction in the 
7:178:12451:28:28:90:504:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits of the Clear Skies Initiative for older populations using the age-differentiated 
7:179:12541:28:0:90:172:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:VSL measures.   
8:180:12558:0:27:126:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Of course, using a constant VSL to estimate the aggregate benefits of a policy that 
8:181:12642:27:28:90:477:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:affects a population with different VSLs is inconsistent with the basic principles 
8:182:12725:28:27:90:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:underlying benefit-cost analysis.  As Sunstein [2004] observes, “a movement toward 
8:183:12808:27:28:90:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater individuation of VSL would undoubtedly be extremely controversial.  But it is not 
8:184:12898:28:28:90:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:merely consistent with that theory that justifies current practice; it is mandated by it.  In 
8:185:12992:28:27:90:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:principle, government should not force people to buy protection against statistical risks 
8:186:13082:27:28:90:398:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:at a price that seems to them excessive” (p. 5, emphasis added). 
8:187:13147:28:27:126:502:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Sunstein’s argument for complete individuation is unlikely to be politically or 
8:188:13227:27:28:90:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:practically feasible.  Most of the policy uses for estimates of income-risk tradeoffs are in 
8:189:13320:28:28:90:484:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:short-term policy analyses with modest resources for new research and short time 
8:190:13401:28:27:90:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:horizons for completion.  Moreover, in many cases, the epidemiological analyses used to 
8:191:13489:27:28:90:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:identify the relationship between environmental quality and health risks simply do not 
8:192:13576:28:27:90:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:have the ability to carefully distinguish how each policy will impact sub-groups in a 
8:193:13662:27:28:90:485:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneous population.  These limitations are noteworthy because they impose 
8:194:13742:28:27:90:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:genuine practical constraints on what constitutes feasible policy analysis.  In reality, the 
8:195:13835:27:28:90:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:uncertainties in measurement largely trump the political debates about the fairness of a 
8:196:13924:28:28:90:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:framework that allows a level of individuation that would be consistent with revealed 
8:197:14010:28:27:90:274:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:preference measures of risk tradeoffs. 
8:198:14049:27:28:126:481:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:These concerns aside, the logic of the hedonic wage equilibrium suggests 
8:199:14122:28:27:90:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneous risk preferences and skills in adapting to job risk will cause workers to sort 
8:200:14215:27:37:90:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:among jobs based on their personal attributes.4  Both an individual’s quality of life and

8:202:14353:7:16:90:495:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 The basic logic of the equilibrium described in a hedonic model has generally been recognized as a 
8:203:14454:16:12:89:503:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:matching process (see Rosen [1974] for an early discussion).  Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim [2002] 
8:204:14553:12:11:89:510:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:provide a brief overview of how this interpretation of the market equilibrium affects the identification of 
8:205:14661:11:0:89:488:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:structural parameters governing the behavioral functions in the process and what can be identified.  
9:206:14763:0:27:90:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantity of life remaining should affect how he or she makes choices in the labor market.  
9:207:14854:27:28:90:524:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:As a result of this sorting, the market equilibrium will reveal different wage/risk tradeoffs 
9:208:14948:28:27:90:486:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:across workers based on each individual’s personal circumstances.  The empirical 
9:209:15029:27:28:90:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:challenge in measuring the role of each person’s quality and quantity remaining of life for 
9:210:15121:28:28:90:487:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk/compensation tradeoffs is to identify instruments that adequately reflect these 
9:211:15206:28:27:90:465:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:dimensions and permit the analysis to overcome the effects of endogeneity of 
9:212:15283:27:28:90:304:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:contemporaneous measures of these effects. 
9:213:15326:28:27:126:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Given the potential constraints on the feasible responses to the empirical evidence 
9:214:15410:27:28:90:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:from a policy perspective, why study the sources of differences in VSL?  We believe 
9:215:15494:28:28:90:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:research on the behavioral sources for differences in the tradeoffs people would make to 
9:216:15583:28:27:90:481:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduce risk can influence other dimensions of risk assessments by identifying the 
9:217:15665:27:28:90:489:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:important features of the heterogeneity in people’s risk tradeoffs. That is, with this 
9:218:15752:28:27:90:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:information it is possible for analysts to focus on a subset of key distinctions that can 
9:219:15842:27:28:90:488:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:arise in selecting the components of the overall risk analysis for special emphasis.  
9:220:15928:28:27:90:500:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Inevitably the preparation of each regulatory impact analysis faces resource and time 
9:221:16014:27:28:90:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraints.  Nonetheless, even if the analyst never explicitly assigns different values to 
9:222:16106:28:28:90:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:each group, knowledge of the potential for differences in the tradeoffs among different 
9:223:16194:28:27:90:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups can contribute to the design of sensitivity analyses to gauge how policy judgments 
9:224:16284:27:28:90:257:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:would change with individuation.  
9:225:16318:28:27:126:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our application does not have sufficient information to develop reliable measures 
9:226:16400:27:28:90:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the VSL for specific groups of individuals.  Instead, we use the results to estimate the

10:234:17025:27:28:90:520:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:from three recent papers by Smith, Pattanayak, and Van Houtven [2003],  Chetty [2006], 
10:235:17112:28:27:89:497:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Hall and Jones [2007] on the relationships among the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of 
10:236:17196:27:28:89:457:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative risk aversion, the compensated labor supply elasticity, the degree of 
10:237:17275:28:28:89:504:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarity between consumption and labor supply, and the value of a statistical 
10:238:17360:28:27:90:508:524:144:Times:144:Times:B:life.  The first (Smith et al. [2003]) develops a simple link between the uncompensated 
10:239:17448:27:28:90:494:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor supply elasticity and the VSL for a specific preference specification, based on 
10:240:17534:28:27:90:518:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:Burtless and Hausman’s [1978] framework.  In particular, Smith et al. find that the wage 
10:241:17623:27:36:90:328:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk tradeoff can be expressed as in equation (1),

10:253:17872:27:29:90:520:307:144:Times:144:Times:B:confirms a more general link between labor supply elasticities and estimates of the VSL.

11:308:19441:8:16:90:514:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 Equation (2) is also related to another connection more closely linked to environmental applications, the 
11:309:19549:16:11:90:498:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) disparity.  It is an extended version of the 
11:310:19651:11:12:90:496:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:relationship Hanemann [1991] used to explain dramatic differences between WTP and WTA for non-
11:311:19745:12:11:90:518:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:market environmental services by establishing a simple connection between the price flexibility of income 
11:312:19851:11:12:90:506:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:for non-market goods, the income elasticity of demand for these goods, and an elasticity of substitution 
11:313:19956:12:7:90:435:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:between these non-market environmental services and a composite of all other goods. 
11:314:20040:7:16:90:520:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 The relationship between the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of relative risk aversion and the income elasticity of 
11:315:20150:16:11:89:493:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:the VSL is closely related to our discussion here.  This relationship was discussed by Eeckhoudt and 
11:316:20251:11:12:89:516:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Hammitt [2001] in an appendix to a paper that focused on the role of background risk for the properties of 
11:317:20358:12:11:89:492:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:wage risk tradeoffs. More recently, Kaplow[2005] develops an analogous relationship to discuss the 
11:318:20457:11:0:89:277:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:properties of the income elasticity of the VSL. 
12:319:20507:0:31:89:512:707:144:Times:144:Times:B:income (α), and compensated labor supply elasticity (clwε), increased complementarity 
12:320:20593:31:31:90:508:676:144:Times:144:Times:B:implies a higher Marshallian labor supply elasticity (lwε) and, by equation (1), a lower 
12:321:20682:31:28:90:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:VSL.  If good health increases the demand for leisure and leisure- related consumption 
12:322:20769:28:27:90:488:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods, then this change can in turn reduce the apparent degree of complementarity 
12:323:20851:27:28:90:523:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:between labor supply and a consumption aggregate as depicted in the Chetty formulation. 
12:324:20939:28:28:126:491:562:144:Times:144:Times:A: Thus, to the extent improved health increases the complementarity between 
12:325:21013:28:27:90:468:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:leisure and consumption we should expect an individual would require greater 
12:326:21090:27:28:90:518:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation to accept risk (a higher VSL).  With poorer health (i.e., a poorer quality of 
12:327:21181:28:27:90:499:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:life), leisure is less complementary to consumption, the uncompensated labor supply 
12:328:21265:27:28:90:513:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:elasticity will be larger and the VSL smaller.  Of course, it is important to acknowledge 
12:329:21355:28:28:90:488:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:the other parameters included in equations (2) and (4) are not constants and can be 
12:330:21439:28:27:90:520:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected to change with health status.  Our argument merely provides motivation for one 
12:331:21527:27:28:90:521:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible channel of influence on the labor supply elasticity – health status as an influence 
12:332:21620:28:27:90:515:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the complementarity between consumption and labor supply. This connection in turn 
12:333:21705:27:28:90:501:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:helps to explain how an individual’s health status can affect her willingness to accept 
12:334:21793:28:27:90:411:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage compensation to accept risk and thus measures of the VSL.   
12:335:21858:27:28:126:523:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:While health status can be considered a measure of the quality of life, our analysis 
12:336:21943:28:28:90:524:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot ignore the potential for the remaining quantity of life to impact the estimated wage 
12:337:22035:28:27:90:523:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk tradeoffs (Pratt and Zeckhauser [1996]).  Therefore, our empirical analysis contains a 
12:338:22127:27:28:90:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure for health status (or quality of life) as well as an instrument intended to reflect 
12:339:22219:28:27:90:519:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:each individual’s unobserved subjective longevity expectations (or perceptions about the 
12:340:22308:27:28:90:505:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantity of life remaining).  Estimates from past studies (including our own) that have 
12:341:22396:28:0:90:494:93:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined the relationship between age and the VSL will reflect the joint impacts of 
13:342:22482:0:27:89:480:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences across individuals in the effects of health status and serious threats to 
13:343:22568:27:28:90:482:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:longevity. To the extent health status, subjective beliefs about longevity, or some 
13:344:22652:28:27:90:492:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:composite of the two effects are correlated with age and separate measures of these 
13:345:22736:27:28:90:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects are not included in the specification of the wage equation, the omission has the 
13:346:22825:28:28:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential to influence estimates of the effects of age on risk tradeoffs.  Our analysis seeks 
13:347:22919:28:27:90:498:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:to disentangle these effects.  Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient information to 
13:348:23006:27:28:90:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:allow a formal test of the hypothesis that differences in estimated VSLs with health status 
13:349:23098:28:27:90:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:stem from differences in the extent of complementarity between consumption and leisure 
13:350:23185:27:28:90:164:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:(labor supply).

13:352:23201:28:27:90:295:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:IV. Empirical Model, Data, and Results 
13:353:23239:27:28:126:481:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our empirical analysis relies on the observed labor market experiences of 
13:354:23313:28:27:89:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We exploit the panel dimension 
13:355:23398:27:28:89:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:of this survey to distinguish measures of the increased risk of death and the deteriorating 
13:356:23490:28:27:89:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of life for this sample of older adults.  In earlier research (Smith et al. [2004]) we 
13:357:23585:27:28:89:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:did not take full advantage of these opportunities. Our earlier analysis was comparable to 
13:358:23676:28:28:89:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:the rest of the literature in that we assumed difference in individuals’ assessments of the 
13:359:23768:28:27:89:499:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of their lives as well as their beliefs about longevity would not independently 
13:360:23856:27:28:89:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence risk tradeoffs revealed in the labor market choices; rather, we assumed age 
13:361:23942:28:27:89:475:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:would proxy for these effects.  We also used an average job risk measure for all 
13:362:24023:27:28:89:495:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents in an industry and assumed this aggregate measure was relevant for the 
13:363:24106:28:0:89:312:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:largely older workers represented in the HRS. 
14:364:24154:0:27:126:507:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Recently, Aldy and Viscusi [2003, 2007a, 2007b] have proposed the use of the 
14:365:24231:27:28:89:490:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) to 
14:366:24313:28:27:89:484:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:develop a refined measure of job risk that accounts for the ages of workers.  They 
14:367:24396:27:28:89:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:structure mortality risk cells for each industry (by 2-digit SIC code) and age group.  Our 
14:368:24487:28:28:89:497:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis uses the same on-the-job fatality risk measures, based on workers’ ages and 
14:369:24572:28:27:89:142:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:industries. 
14:370:24584:27:28:125:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:We consider three sets of models.  The first is our primary model.  The model 
14:371:24662:28:27:89:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls for demographic attributes, occupation, a measure of risk tolerance (again as a 
14:372:24751:27:28:89:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:qualitative variable), and the age- and industry-specific job risk.  This model treats age 
14:373:24842:28:28:90:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-parametrically, using a set of categorical variables that distinguish different age 
14:374:24930:28:27:89:499:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:intervals.  We consider interactions of job risk with age, risk tolerance, as well as the 
14:375:25020:27:28:89:492:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of life measure and our instrument for perceived longevity.  To evaluate the 
14:376:25105:28:27:89:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:sensitivity of our findings to the treatment of age, our second set of models includes age 
14:377:25196:27:28:89:491:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:and age squared as an alternative description for how age has been hypothesized to 
14:378:25278:28:27:89:493:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence wages along with risk tradeoffs. This specification also includes the same 
14:379:25363:27:28:89:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls as in the primary model.  The third set of models excludes age and risk tolerance 
14:380:25454:28:28:89:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures to evaluate whether the effects of the health status variable and the longevity 
14:381:25543:28:27:89:515:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:instrument are influenced by the presence of these other controls.  Finally, the last set of 
14:382:25636:27:28:89:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:models considers the effects of health status and longevity separately to evaluate whether 
14:383:25727:28:27:89:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:these variables offer robust measures of the separate influences of individual effects of 
14:384:25817:27:28:89:501:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:the quality and the quantity of life remaining.  Rather than report all the estimates for 
14:385:25907:28:0:89:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:each model we present the key parameter estimates for our primary model and include 
15:386:25993:0:27:89:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:selective comparisons using the estimates with the other sets of findings.  These added 
15:387:26081:27:28:90:474:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:models are intended to be largely checks on the robustness of our main results.  
15:388:26162:28:27:126:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:There is an important qualification to our estimates. We do not claim that the 
15:389:26241:27:28:90:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:HRS sample provides sufficient information to estimate the VSLs for heterogeneous 
15:390:26323:28:28:90:473:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:workers over the full range of individual circumstances. As we and others have 
15:391:26402:28:27:90:496:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:previously noted (see for example Viscusi and Aldy [2007]), the HRS is intended to 
15:392:26485:27:28:90:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect behavior of older adults.  The younger respondents in the sample are spouses (or

15:394:26657:27:28:90:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupations represented may not be as detailed as the samples usually considered for 
15:395:26742:28:28:90:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimating wage risk tradeoffs. Finally, to assure our analysis is aligned with the hedonic 
15:396:26834:28:27:90:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage model’s assumptions we limit the sample to respondents paid by the hour. These 
15:397:26918:27:28:90:497:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions yield a smaller sample in comparison to what has been available in other 
15:398:27004:28:27:90:237:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent hedonic wage studies.   
15:399:27035:27:28:126:504:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a result of these considerations, we focus on how the relative risk tradeoffs 
15:400:27116:28:27:90:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:among workers within this sample vary with health status and longevity threats. Equation 
15:401:27205:27:28:90:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:(5) adapts the conventional form of a wage hedonic function to include the added terms 
15:402:27292:28:72:90:203:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:for our primary model.

16:456:27752:31:28:90:501:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupational dummy variables.  Our notation uses (t – 1) as a subscript to imply the   
16:457:27839:28:27:89:504:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:interview wave preceding the occupational outcome (the preceding interview actually

16:459:28009:28:28:90:175:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:(two years later). 
16:460:28028:28:27:126:524:534:144:Times:144:Times:A:BLSriskit measures the number of fatalities per 10,000 workers associated with the 
16:461:28111:27:28:89:519:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual’s industry, based on the 2-digit SIC code, and age range (16-19, 20-24, 25-34, 
16:462:28201:28:27:90:524:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+).7  The age- and industry-specific fatality data are from the BLS 
16:463:28292:27:28:89:512:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries while the age- and industry-specific employment 
16:464:28378:28:28:89:413:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:data are annual averages based on the Current Population Survey.   
16:465:28445:28:31:125:511:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:Age, in our primary model, is treated non-parametrically with the litAge terms.  
16:466:28526:31:29:90:512:365:144:Times:144:Times:B:The five terms classify respondents into one of six age classes, 44 and under, 45-50, 51-
16:467:28615:29:32:90:499:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:55, 56-60, 61-65, and over 65 (i.e., 1=litAge if respondent i’s age falls in the lth age 
16:468:28704:32:31:90:515:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:class and 0 otherwise; the omitted category is greater than 65).  The ()1−tjiTol terms refer 
16:469:28797:31:28:90:498:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:to dummy variables formed using a qualitative variable defined by the risk tolerance 
16:470:28882:28:28:90:523:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure described in Barsky et al. [1997].  The risk tolerance index is based on responses 
16:471:28973:28:27:90:506:217:144:Times:144:Times:B:from a previous interview to questions about choices between a secure job for life and 
16:472:29060:27:28:89:510:190:144:Times:144:Times:B:another job with a 50-50 chance of two different income levels.8  With locally constant 
16:473:29148:28:28:90:501:162:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative risk aversion, the answers classify respondents into one of four risk tolerance 
16:474:29237:28:37:89:492:134:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories, with category 1 indicating the least risk averse and 4 the most.  The risk 
16:475:29324:37:7:234:237:97:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
16:476:29372:7:12:90:389:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 Note that the two youngest age ranges are not represented in our sample. 
16:477:29447:12:0:90:371:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 The risk tolerance question was not asked in all waves of the HRS.   
17:478:29520:0:27:89:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:tolerance index included in equation (5) is therefore a measure of financial risk aversion.  
17:479:29613:27:28:89:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:While by definition an increase in risk aversion defined as in the term’s colloquial use 
17:480:29702:28:27:90:517:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases the VSL, Eeckhoudt and Hammitt [2004] show that the effect of an increase in 
17:481:29789:27:28:90:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial risk aversion on the WTP to reduce mortality risk is, in general, ambiguous.   
17:482:29878:28:28:125:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:A: The last three interaction terms provide our basis for distinguishing the effects of 
17:483:29963:28:27:90:477:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:health status/quality of life and serious threats to longevity on the estimated risk 
17:484:30048:27:29:90:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoffs.  In constructing these terms, we make use of two additional binary variables, 
17:485:30137:29:32:90:375:514:144:Times:144:Times:B:represented in equation (5) by ()1−tiExhealth and ()1+tiDead. 
17:486:30199:32:32:125:510:482:144:Times:144:Times:A: Our quality of life measure, ()1−tiExhealth, is defined based on each individual’s 
17:487:30282:32:28:90:518:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:response to a question about the state of his or her current health as excellent, very good, 
17:488:30375:28:28:90:506:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:good, fair, or poor and exploits the panel featuring the HRS.  We use each individual's 
17:489:30463:28:31:90:502:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:response to this health question in the preceding wave.9  Thus the qualitative variable 
17:490:30551:31:29:136:476:363:63:g_d0_f5:144:Times:?:()1−tiExhealth corresponds to answers from the interview preceding the observed 
17:491:30631:29:28:89:515:334:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupational choice.  If a respondent answered that he or she was in excellent health the 
17:492:30721:28:36:89:452:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable is coded as unity.  Otherwise, ()1−tiExhealth takes a value of zero.   
17:493:30801:36:29:156:509:270:63:g_d0_f5:144:Times:?:()1+tiDead is constructed to identify those individuals facing impending, serious 
17:494:30883:29:28:89:515:241:144:Times:144:Times:B:threats to longevity.  While information about immediate, serious health conditions may 
17:495:30971:28:27:89:517:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:be known to respondents, it appears that they do not report all aspects of their subjective 
17:496:31063:27:29:89:521:186:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessments at the time of each wave's interview (see Smith et al. [2001]).  Therefore, we 
17:497:31154:29:32:89:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:use the occurrence of death in the near future to proxy for such information. ()1+tiDead is 
17:498:31246:32:0:90:505:125:144:Times:144:Times:B:a dummy variable to identify people who died between the interview wave when their 
18:499:31331:0:28:89:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor market choices were reported and the subsequent interview.  These are confirmed 
18:500:31417:28:32:89:518:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:deaths and not sample attrition for other reasons. 10  ()1−tiExhealth and ()1+tiDead, through 
18:501:31511:32:28:90:509:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:the final three interaction terms in equation (5), provide instruments for identifying the 
18:502:31602:28:27:90:477:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of excellent quality of life and serious longevity threats on estimated risk 
18:503:31687:27:28:90:139:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoffs. 
18:504:31698:28:27:125:483:565:144:Times:144:Times:A:As noted in Smith et al. [2004], selection into the labor force or into other 
18:505:31776:27:28:90:519:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment categories such as retirement is an important consideration when examining 
18:506:31862:28:28:90:514:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:the occupational choices of older workers.   In order to address this, we follow the same 
18:507:31952:28:27:90:484:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:logic as discussed in Smith et al. [2004], relying on the Bourguignon et al. [2001] 
18:508:32036:27:29:90:522:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:generalization of the two step selection framework.  We first estimate a multinomial logit 
18:509:32127:29:31:90:477:426:144:Times:144:Times:B:selection model of labor force status.  The sitS terms in equation (5) are then the 
18:510:32211:31:27:90:516:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectations for the wage model’s error conditional on employment state that arise from 
18:511:32299:27:28:90:515:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:the selection model (see Smith et al. [2004] for further discussion) and reflect choices at 
18:512:32391:28:27:90:494:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:the extensive margin (e.g., work, retire, unemployed, etc.) that give rise to selection 
18:513:32479:27:28:90:212:313:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects on wage models.  
18:514:32504:28:28:126:520:285:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our wage model estimates are based primarily on information obtained in wave 2 
18:515:32583:28:27:89:494:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), conducted in 1994.  The HRS is a panel 
18:516:32664:27:28:89:488:230:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey designed to represent individuals between ages 51 and 61 in 1992 and their 
18:517:32746:28:27:89:513:202:144:Times:144:Times:B:spouses (whose ages need not fall within the targeted age range).  The initial interviews 
18:518:32836:27:28:89:493:175:144:Times:144:Times:B:were conducted in 1992 with follow-up interviews scheduled every two years.  The 
18:519:32917:28:28:89:518:147:144:Times:144:Times:B:baseline survey included 12,652 persons (7,600 households).  The panel was designed to 
18:520:33004:28:7:521:524:119:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                                                                                                                 
18:521:33148:7:16:90:493:112:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 Both current and previous wave responses to these health condition questions are also significantly

19:525:33524:27:28:89:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:health, and income relationships.  The HRS structure allows construction of the quality of 
19:526:33615:28:27:89:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:life instrument based on wave 1 (1992) subjective health status and the impending serious 
19:527:33705:27:28:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:health shock instrument based on deaths between waves 2 (1994) and 3 (1996).  For 
19:528:33787:28:28:89:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistency with the notation adopted in equation (5), the time subscripts 1−t, t, and 
19:529:33874:28:28:105:364:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:1+t correspond to 1992, 1994, and 1996 respectively.    
19:530:33930:28:28:126:499:542:144:Times:144:Times:A:While a number of waves are available for analysis, when considering waves 
19:531:34005:28:27:89:514:514:144:Times:144:Times:B:beyond wave 2 (1994), the analysis confronts the limitations imposed by the age profile 
19:532:34093:27:28:89:523:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the sample. This structure implies a decrease in the number of respondents with typical 
19:533:34184:28:27:89:517:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment patterns. This decline limited our earlier analysis of wage/job risk tradeoffs 
19:534:34274:27:28:89:516:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:as the HRS sample aged.11  For this reason, our current analysis focuses on labor market 
19:535:34363:28:28:89:500:404:144:Times:144:Times:B:experience as of wave 2.  As noted earlier, our sample for the hedonic wage model is 
19:536:34448:28:27:89:524:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited to workers paid on an hourly basis, where the BLS fatality rates are more likely to 
19:537:34540:27:28:89:279:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect the job risks faced by workers.   
19:538:34582:28:27:125:489:321:144:Times:144:Times:A:Estimation of the multinomial logit selection model requires that we define 
19:539:34658:27:28:89:491:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:relevant labor force status categories, working and paid by the hour being one such 
19:540:34742:28:28:89:460:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:category.  We select five other categories: working and not paid by the hour, 
19:541:34820:28:27:89:512:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:unemployed, retired and not currently working, disabled, and not in the labor force.  As 
19:542:34909:27:28:89:517:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Smith et al. [2004], we hypothesize that an individual’s marital status, age, number of 
19:543:35000:28:27:89:505:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:people living in his household, his household’s capital income, and whether or not his 
19:544:35087:27:47:89:493:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:health limits his work opportunities will influence his labor force status decision.

19:546:35320:8:11:90:424:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Unfortunately the records do not include information about the causes of death.   
19:547:35405:11:16:90:522:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 See Smith et al. [2004] for an example of the marked decline in workers from wave 1 continuing to work 
19:548:35511:16:0:90:136:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:by wave 4. 
20:549:35524:0:27:126:484:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 1 reports the results of the multi-state selection model in addition to 
20:550:35602:27:28:90:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:summary statistics by labor force status.  Coefficients are interpreted as relative to the 
20:551:35693:28:27:90:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:excluded category, working and not paid hourly.  For example, the coefficient on age is 
20:552:35781:27:28:90:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive and significant for the disabled category, suggesting that, relative to respondents 
20:553:35874:28:28:90:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:who are working and not paid hourly, respondents who are disabled tend to be older.  The 
20:554:35963:28:27:90:479:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:results suggest that relative to respondents who are working and not paid hourly, 
20:555:36045:27:28:90:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:respondents who are working and paid hourly, unemployed, or disabled are less likely to 
20:556:36133:28:27:90:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:be married.  The negative and significant coefficient on household capital income for all 
20:557:36223:27:28:90:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories indicates that household capital income is lower for other respondents relative 
20:558:36314:28:28:90:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:to respondents who are working and not paid hourly.12  Relative to respondents who are 
20:559:36401:28:27:90:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:working and not paid hourly, respondents who are unemployed, retired and not working, 
20:560:36487:27:28:90:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:disabled, or not in the labor force are more likely to report that their health limits their 
20:561:36580:28:27:90:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability to work.  As expected, this variable is insignificant for the working and paid 
20:562:36667:27:28:90:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:hourly category.  In general, the results of the multi-state selection model are consistent 
20:563:36759:28:27:90:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:with expectations.  Based on these results, we estimate conditional expectations for the 
20:564:36848:27:28:90:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage equation’s error for each labor force state and include these terms as independent 
20:565:36936:28:28:90:278:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables in the hedonic wage model.   
20:566:36975:28:27:126:502:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 2 provides summary statistics and a selected set of parametric estimates 
20:567:37054:27:32:90:505:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:from six of the hedonic wage models motivated by equation (5).13 All estimated wage

20:569:37186:8:18:90:518:172:64:Times:100:Times:F:12 Household capital income is the sum of household business or farm income, self-employment earnings, 
20:570:37288:18:7:89:517:154:100:Times:144:Times:B:business income, gross rent, dividend and interest income, trust funds or royalties, and other asset income. 
20:571:37396:7:16:90:518:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 In order to assure the existence of a wage-risk premium in line with the existing literature, we estimate a 
20:572:37507:16:11:90:496:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:conventional hedonic wage model (equation (5) without any of the interaction terms).  The estimated 
20:573:37607:11:12:90:512:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:coefficient on the risk term in this equation is statistically significant and equal to 0.042.  This implies an 
20:574:37719:12:11:90:504:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimated VSL of $9.6 million (2000$), above the median of $7 million reported in Viscusi and Aldy’s 
20:575:37820:11:12:90:518:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:[2003] meta analysis, but still within the range of values from what they considered to be the most reliable 
20:576:37929:12:11:90:125:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:studies.

21:578:37941:0:27:89:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:equations were adjusted for selection effects as discussed above.  While not reported, the 
21:579:38032:27:28:89:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:selection terms are jointly significant influences on wages (p-value = 0.01).  The number

21:581:38209:27:28:90:495:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 2 presents the ratios of the estimated coefficients to their respective estimated 
21:582:38297:28:28:90:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard errors based on the Huber [1967] robust covariance matrix.  In earlier research 
21:583:38386:28:27:90:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:we compared the Huber robust covariance matrix along with bootstrapped standard errors 
21:584:38473:27:28:90:473:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:and found no differences in conclusions about the role of job risk, age, and risk 
21:585:38555:28:27:90:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:preferences. Each of the models includes fixed effects for the occupational categories 
21:586:38642:27:28:90:397:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:identified in equation (5) but these are not reported in the table. 
21:587:38710:28:28:126:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:The remaining models in the table are distinguished based on the treatment of the 
21:588:38792:28:27:90:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:age terms and the inclusion or exclusion of the quality of life and subjective longevity  
21:589:38882:27:28:89:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction terms.  Specification (2) includes age in linear and quadratic terms as well as 
21:590:38974:28:27:89:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:in categorized variables that are interacted with the BLS risk.  Specifications (3) and (4) 
21:591:39066:27:28:89:501:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:drop the categorized treatment of age and use the linear and quadratic terms with risk 
21:592:39153:28:27:89:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:interactions as in work by Aldy and Viscusi.  These two specifications vary based on the 
21:593:39242:27:28:89:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion or exclusion of risk tolerance, quality of life and longevity threat effects.  In 
21:594:39334:28:28:89:479:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:order to investigate whether the treatment of serious longevity threats influences 
21:595:39417:28:27:89:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of risk tradeoffs independent of quality of life considerations, we re-estimate 
21:596:39507:27:28:89:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the primary model, eliminating the interaction effects used to identify the quality of life 
21:597:39599:28:27:89:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessments. We repeat the same exercise eliminating interactions for longevity threats to 
21:598:39690:27:28:89:499:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:consider whether the quality of life effects are robust to this exclusion. The final two 
21:599:39779:28:28:89:506:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:specifications in Table (2) report these results.  In addition to the estimates reported in 
21:600:39871:28:0:89:520:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 2, we also considered a variety of other models that varied the treatment of the risk 
22:601:39965:0:27:89:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:tolerance, the quality of life/health status, and the longevity effects terms.  All of these 
22:602:40058:27:28:89:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:variations were developed to evaluate whether our basic conclusions would change with 
22:603:40144:28:27:89:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:plausible variations in the model specification. A summary of these comparisons would 
22:604:40230:27:28:89:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest that our findings are quite robust to all of the model variations we considered. 
22:605:40319:28:28:125:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:Because the BLS risk term enters alone and in interactions with age, risk tolerance 
22:606:40403:28:27:89:510:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures, and the variables used to gauge the quality of life and longevity perceptions, 
22:607:40492:27:28:89:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the size, magnitude and significance of the coefficient for the simple risk term cannot be 
22:608:40583:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpreted independently.  The interaction terms including the risk measure must be 
22:609:40668:27:28:89:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:considered in evaluating the size and significance of the estimated marginal effect of job 
22:610:40759:28:28:89:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk on the natural log of wages.  To test for the effects of risk on wage compensation 
22:611:40847:28:27:89:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements we need to consider several different coefficient sums.  The estimated wage 
22:612:40936:27:28:89:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:differentials are formed by summing the coefficients on the risk term and the appropriate 
22:613:41026:28:28:89:484:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction terms for each group.  For example, in order to test the hypothesis that

22:626:41342:26:28:126:519:238:144:Times:144:Times:A:In discussing the results of our hedonic wage analysis, we begin with the primary 
22:627:41424:28:28:90:475:210:144:Times:144:Times:B:model.  The first step in considering the effects of age, risk tolerance, quality of 
22:628:41509:28:27:90:502:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:life/health status, and anticipated longevity on estimated wage-risk tradeoffs is to test 
22:629:41599:27:28:90:513:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether all these interactions can jointly be omitted from the model.  We reject the null 
22:630:41689:28:27:90:506:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis that the interaction terms are jointly zero (p-value = 0.006).  The set of age 
22:631:41779:27:0:90:517:100:144:Times:144:Times:B:and risk tolerance interactions terms are jointly significant at a marginal level (p-value = 
23:632:41874:0:27:89:507:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.099); the health status and anticipated longevity effects strengthen the importance of

23:647:42688:28:27:89:491:413:144:Times:144:Times:B:for both subjective health-related quality of life, under “Excellent health” and “Not 
23:648:42774:27:28:89:521:386:144:Times:144:Times:B:excellent health”, and the presence and absence of threats to longevity, under “Longevity 
23:649:42864:28:28:89:519:358:144:Times:144:Times:B:threat” and “No longevity threat”.15  The coefficient sum reported in the left-hand side of 
23:650:42956:28:27:89:521:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:each cell results from specification (1), our primary model.  The coefficient sum reported 
23:651:43047:27:28:89:463:303:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the right-hand side of each cell results from specification (3).  Recall these 
23:652:43129:28:27:89:486:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:specifications differ only in their treatment of age; specification (1) treats age non-
23:653:43216:27:69:89:502:248:144:Times:144:Times:B:parametrically while specification (3) follows the parametric treatment of age used in 
23:654:43303:69:7:234:237:179:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
23:655:43351:7:16:90:508:172:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 While not reported, we estimated a model excluding the age and risk tolerance interaction terms.  The 
23:656:43456:16:12:90:509:156:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimated coefficients (and levels of significance) on the three interaction terms measuring the effects of 
23:657:43564:12:8:90:364:144:100:Times:100:Times:F:health status and longevity threats are similar to our primary model. 
23:658:43634:8:15:90:513:136:42:Times:102:g_d0_f5:F:15 Relative to those results presented here, we were unable to reject the hypothesis that ()()

23:663:43754:25:11:89:502:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:for some of the groups not represented in Table 3.  However, all unreported coefficient sums from this 
23:664:43857:11:12:89:524:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:model are either positive and statistically significant or not statistically different from zero.  See Smith et al. 
23:665:43973:12:11:89:520:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:[2004] for a discussion of differences between the younger workers represented in the HRS sample and the 
23:666:44078:11:0:89:381:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Current Population Survey.  Full results are available from the authors.   
24:667:44155:0:27:89:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Viscusi and Aldy.16  Computation of comparable coefficient sums using the results of 
24:668:44240:27:28:90:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification (3) required that we focus on particular ages, rather than age ranges.  For 
24:669:44330:28:27:90:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison, we computed coefficient sums for ages 55, 60, and 65.  Comparing the terms 
24:670:44417:27:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:within each cell, we see the magnitude of the estimated effects are very similar regardless 
24:671:44509:28:28:90:476:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of our treatment of age.  Given these similarities, we restrict our attention in the 
24:672:44594:28:27:90:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussion that follows to the results for specification (1), reported in the left-hand side of 
24:673:44690:27:28:90:138:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:each cell. 
24:674:44701:28:27:125:489:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:We conduct pair-wise comparisons of the estimated coefficient sums (from 
24:675:44774:27:28:90:493:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification (1)), testing whether or not the observed differences across groups are 
24:676:44860:28:28:90:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant.  The null hypothesis is equality of the estimated coefficient sums 
24:677:44954:28:27:90:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponding to each comparison pair.  Table 4 reports the p-values of a subset of these 
24:678:45044:27:28:90:416:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:tests where the age and risk tolerance categories are held constant.   
24:679:45115:28:27:125:505:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results allow us to distinguish three types of effects.  First, we discuss test 
24:680:45199:27:28:90:498:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:results for how impending serious longevity threats -- facing the prospect of death -- 
24:681:45286:28:27:90:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence the risk tradeoff.  This relationship also serves as a test of one interpretation of 
24:682:45381:27:28:90:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Pratt-Zeckhauser [1996] dead anyway hypothesis—individuals facing impending 
24:683:45461:28:28:90:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:serious health threats would be willing to pay more to realize even a small risk reduction.  
24:684:45554:28:38:90:507:239:145:Times:144:Times:B:Second, we investigate whether an individual's subjective opinion of his health-related 
24:685:45642:38:8:234:237:201:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
24:686:45690:8:16:90:523:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 The results of specification (3) are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between age and the 
24:687:45800:16:11:90:523:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:VSL as has been found in work summarized by Aldy and Viscusi [2007b].  However, the estimated peak of 
24:688:45902:11:12:90:521:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:the relationship occurs around age 56 for our sample.  Aldy and Viscusi report a peak at about age 40. Two 
24:689:46009:12:11:90:519:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:aspects of this comparison should be noted. First, if we review the results from our earlier analysis that did 
24:690:46120:11:12:90:510:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:not take account of quality or quantity issues and introduced age non-parametrically, the estimated wage 
24:691:46225:12:11:90:503:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:rsik tradeoffs were not precisely estimated for the 61-to 65 age group. Age category 56-60 was the last 
24:692:46329:11:12:90:512:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:group with significant estimates of the effects by risk tolerance group (see table 3 in Smith et al. [2004]). 
24:693:46439:12:11:90:523:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:Second and equally important, a quadratic specification for any variable restricts effects to a parabolic form 
24:694:46550:11:12:90:517:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:(either U or inverted U shapes). A non-parametric or categorical coding allows for different effects by age 
24:695:46658:12:11:90:503:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:category but does not restrict the form of those differences. As a result, it is our preferred treatment for 
24:696:46767:11:0:90:190:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:examining age effects.    
25:697:46795:0:27:89:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of life influences the relative size of the effect due to serious longevity threats.  
25:698:46889:27:28:90:484:681:145:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, we examine the independent effect of quality of life on the estimated risk 
25:699:46973:28:27:90:139:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoffs. 
25:700:46984:27:28:125:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:Pair wise comparisons of the terms in the left-hand sides of columns 2 and 3, and 
25:701:47066:28:28:90:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:4 and 5 respectively provide evidence consistent with an effect of longevity threats on 
25:702:47154:28:27:90:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk tradeoffs and support what we described as the dead anyway hypothesis.  For a given 
25:703:47243:27:28:90:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:age, risk tolerance category, and quality of life, the dead anyway hypothesis would 
25:704:47327:28:27:90:501:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest larger coefficient sums among individuals who expect serious adverse health 
25:705:47411:27:28:90:507:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:shocks (columns 2 and 4 of Table 3).  For people who rated their health as excellent in 
25:706:47499:28:28:89:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:wave 1 with an impending serious longevity threat, the coefficient sums presented in 
25:707:47584:28:27:89:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:column 2 are at least six times the size of the estimated risk tradeoff for those in excellent 
25:708:47679:27:28:89:497:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:health without the impending threat.  This difference is significant at the high end of 
25:709:47767:28:27:89:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:conventional levels (p-value = 0.085).  Comparisons of columns 4 and 5 confirm the 
25:710:47850:27:28:89:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:large differential associated with impending threats to longevity for individuals in health 
25:711:47942:28:27:89:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories other than excellent.  This difference is also significant (p-value = 0.050).  The 
25:712:48036:27:28:90:487:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated coefficient sums reported in columns 2 and 4 are large and would imply 
25:713:48117:28:28:90:497:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:extremely large VSL measures.  We return to this point later in the discussion of our 
25:714:48203:28:27:90:127:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:results. 
25:715:48212:27:28:125:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Comparisons of coefficient sums associated with excellent or not excellent health 
25:716:48294:28:27:89:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:within the same age, risk tolerance, and longevity threat category allow us to examine 
25:717:48381:27:28:89:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of life effects.  Among those respondents with impending serious longevity 
25:718:48464:28:28:89:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:threats, the coefficient sums for the excellent health categories (in column 2) consistently 
25:719:48557:28:0:90:482:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceed those for the “not in excellent health” groups (in column 4).  However, as 
26:720:48641:0:27:89:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported in Table 4, these differences are not statistically significant (p-value = 0.254).  
26:721:48734:27:28:89:495:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Comparing the coefficient sums in columns 3 and 5 yields a smaller but statistically 
26:722:48819:28:27:89:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant quality of life premium among respondents who do not expect serious health 
26:723:48906:27:28:89:214:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:threats (p-value = 0.018). 
26:724:48933:28:28:125:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:In order to investigate whether the effects of serious longevity threats displayed a 
26:725:49018:28:27:89:516:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:fairly robust influence on risk tradeoffs independent of quality of life considerations, we 
26:726:49110:27:28:89:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:conduct a similar exercise using the results of specification (5).  A subset of these results 
26:727:49204:28:27:90:493:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:is presented in columns six and seven of Table 3.  Pair-wise comparisons confirm a 
26:728:49287:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant premium (p-value = 0.019) for those who face serious threats, the relative size 
26:729:49379:28:28:90:476:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of which is consistent with the model accounting for quality of life differences.  
26:730:49462:28:27:90:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, the coefficient sums are not as large, suggesting that quality of life and serious 
26:731:49554:27:28:90:398:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:threats to longevity may well be confounded in these estimates. 
26:732:49618:28:27:125:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results presented in the final two columns of Table 3 reflect the impact of 
26:733:49698:27:28:89:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in quality of life, independent of longevity threats, on the estimated wage-risk 
26:734:49791:28:27:89:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:tradeoffs.  The selected coefficient sums are formed using the results of specification (6), 
26:735:49884:27:28:89:497:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:which excludes the interaction terms used to identify the effects of serious longevity 
26:736:49971:28:28:89:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:threats.  The coefficient sums in the eighth column, reflecting those with excellent health-
26:737:50063:28:27:89:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:related quality of life, are approximately twice as large as the respective coefficient sums 
26:738:50156:27:28:89:488:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the final column.  The estimated quality of life premium suggested by pair-wise 
26:739:50239:28:27:89:433:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparisons of these coefficient sums is significant (p-value = 0.018).  
26:740:50312:27:28:125:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:To further explore the implications of allowing the estimated risk tradeoffs to vary 
26:741:50397:28:28:90:491:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:with quality of life, we compute what we call relative risk tradeoffs for the age/risk 
26:742:50484:28:0:89:507:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:tolerance groups with significant coefficient sums in the final two columns of Table 3. 
27:743:50574:0:27:89:499:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 5 presents these relative risk tradeoffs, which represent ratios of the associated 
27:744:50663:27:28:89:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:VSL estimates in 2000 dollars for respondents in excellent health to the VSL estimates 
27:745:50750:28:27:89:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:for respondents not in excellent health.  Below each relative tradeoff is the p-value for a 
27:746:50842:27:28:89:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:test that the ratio is significantly different from one.  We test this hypothesis using the 
27:747:50934:28:28:89:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:nlcom command in Stata.17  In each case, the relative tradeoff is significantly different 
27:748:51024:28:27:89:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:from one at a p-value of 0.05 or less, indicating that individuation on the basis of quality 
27:749:51117:27:28:89:504:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:of life leads to a significant difference in estimates of the marginal rate of substitution 
27:750:51209:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:between risk and wealth.  For the respondents in our sample, excellent health almost 
27:751:51294:27:28:89:278:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:doubles the incremental risk tradeoff.   
27:752:51335:28:28:125:492:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:As we noted, if differences in health status lead to variation in the degree of 
27:753:51415:28:27:89:476:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarity between consumption and labor supply, we should also expect 
27:754:51491:27:28:89:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in estimated risk tradeoffs with health status.  Our results are consistent with 
27:755:51584:28:27:89:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:this response.  Of course, we would not suggest that all the variation in VSL estimates 
27:756:51672:27:28:89:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:with age can be attributed exclusively to differences in the health status of older adults.  
27:757:51765:28:27:89:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rather we argue that it is important to acknowledge that the older adults in our sample 
27:758:51853:27:28:89:474:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:differentially experience serious health conditions that can alter their subjective 
27:759:51937:28:28:89:485:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessments of the quality of their lives and influence their labor/leisure choices.   
27:760:52024:28:27:125:502:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:For each individual, consumption decisions are constrained by time as well as 
27:761:52102:27:28:89:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:income; time is required to enjoy the consumption that is permitted by increased income 
27:762:52190:28:27:89:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:arising from the labor each person supplies.  Chetty’s analysis reminds analysts that when 
27:763:52281:27:28:89:496:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:we attempt to understand the interactions between labor supply and risk preferences 
27:764:52365:28:32:89:516:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:revealed through wage/risk tradeoffs, we have several “windows” on preferences. In our 
27:765:52452:32:7:234:237:97:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
27:766:52500:7:16:90:515:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 The calculation assumes that wage, hours worked per week, and weeks worked per year are fixed at the 
27:767:52604:16:0:90:343:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:mean values for the respective age and risk tolerance category. 
28:768:52670:0:27:89:496:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis variation in health status was one means to reconcile Chetty’s argument for 
28:769:52755:27:28:89:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:different degrees of complementarity between labor supply and consumption to motivate 
28:770:52841:28:27:89:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption (and in the labor supply 
28:771:52933:27:28:89:194:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:elasticity and VSL).   
28:772:52956:28:28:125:498:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:Before turning to a brief discussion of the implications of these findings, it is 
28:773:53038:28:27:89:502:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:important to acknowledge that our results are consistent across age and risk tolerance 
28:774:53125:27:28:89:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:classes and different estimated wage models.  We have limited the discussion of the full 
28:775:53214:28:27:89:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:structure of our wage model or the multiple state selection model because both have been 
28:776:53303:27:28:89:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussed for another closely related sample in Smith et al. [2004].  However, these other 
28:777:53394:28:28:89:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:components of the model assure that for this sample the effects of the quality of life and 
28:778:53485:28:27:89:515:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:serious longevity threat terms are being estimated within a framework that  accounts for 
28:779:53574:27:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:an array of conventional covariates as well as the selection effects associated with the 
28:780:53663:28:27:90:255:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor force participation decision. 
28:781:53699:27:28:125:490:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a final exercise, we estimate two additional models, both variants of our 
28:782:53776:28:27:90:486:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary model, in order to examine the robustness of our results to changes in our 
28:783:53859:27:28:89:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:longevity threat measure.  First, we replace the future deaths variable with an alternative 
28:784:53951:28:28:89:500:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:instrument measuring serious threats to longevity, a qualitative variable identifying a 
28:785:54039:28:27:89:509:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:newly diagnosed cancer or stroke between waves 2 and 3.  Compared to the number of 
28:786:54122:27:28:89:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:deaths experienced between waves 2 and 3, there were more new cases of these two 
28:787:54203:28:27:89:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:serious health conditions (i.e., 46 cases versus 23 deaths).18  We re-estimated the model 
28:788:54293:27:28:90:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported in columns six and seven of Table 3 using this new variable.  As a second 
28:789:54376:28:0:90:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:exercise, we replace the future deaths variable with a variable indicating more than one 
29:790:54467:0:27:89:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital stay between waves 2 and 3. 19  Table 6 reports the resulting coefficient sums 
29:791:54555:27:28:89:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:from these two models for a subset of age and risk tolerance groups.20  For both models, 
29:792:54644:28:27:89:494:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:pair-wise comparisons indicate significant differences between the coefficient sums 
29:793:54728:27:28:89:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported in columns 2 and 3 (p-value = 0.078), and 4 and 5 (p-value = 0.018).  The results 
29:794:54819:28:28:89:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:confirm a premium when we replace a future death with these two alternative indicators 
29:795:54906:28:27:89:248:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:of serious threats to longevity.

29:797:54942:28:27:90:172:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:V. Implications 
29:798:54958:27:28:125:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:A: The mature workers in our sample appear to select jobs with risks in ways that are 
29:799:55041:28:28:90:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditioned by their personal assessments of their longevity and the quality of their lives.  
29:800:55135:28:27:90:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Serious threats to longevity affect the expected quantity of life remaining and, as a result, 
29:801:55229:27:28:90:488:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the relative risk tradeoffs. We have provided a model that indicates a clear role for 
29:802:55315:28:27:90:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:subjective assessments of health status in these tradeoffs as well.  Those in excellent 
29:803:55403:27:28:90:504:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:health require significantly greater compensation to accept risk increases compared to 
29:804:55490:28:27:90:491:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:those who are not.  This finding lends support to health status or quality of life as a 
29:805:55578:27:28:90:505:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential source of variation in the degree complementarity between consumption and 
29:806:55662:28:43:90:156:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor supply. 
29:807:55676:43:7:521:524:224:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                                                                                                                 
29:808:55820:7:17:90:520:217:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 The number of deaths may seem especially limiting, considering all the coefficients reported in Table 1.  
29:809:55929:17:11:90:517:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:However, only two parameters (θ2 and θ3) are estimated to distinguish the hypotheses regarding quality of 
29:810:56035:11:7:89:194:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:life and longevity threats. 
29:811:56063:7:16:90:512:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 124 respondents report more than one hospital stay between waves 2 and 3.  In these final two models, 
29:812:56168:16:12:90:521:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:the sample sizes in the hedonic wage model reduce to 2521 and 2520 due to the exclusion of those who die 
29:813:56273:12:11:90:519:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:between waves 2 and 3 and to those respondents for whom we are unable to determine whether or not they 
29:814:56376:11:12:90:511:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:have experienced a stroke or cancer or a hospital stay in between waves 2 and 3.  While not reported, the 
29:815:56482:12:11:90:494:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimated coefficients of the selection models and the hedonic wage models are similar to the results 
29:816:56584:11:7:90:200:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:reported in Tables 1 and 2. 
29:817:56612:7:16:90:489:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 All but one unreported coefficient sum for the final two models is either positive and statistically 
29:818:56716:16:12:90:496:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:significant or not statistically different from zero.  In the future cancer or stroke model, the estimated 
29:819:56823:12:11:90:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:coefficient sum for the older than 66, most risk tolerant with no future cancer or stoke group is negative and 
29:820:56934:11:0:90:195:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:statistically significant.     
30:821:56967:0:27:125:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Thus, these estimates suggest that current modeling decisions that rely on simple 
30:822:57049:27:28:89:469:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:descriptions of each individual’s life expectancy based on age alone may offer 
30:823:57128:28:27:89:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:incomplete basis for judging the wage/ risk tradeoffs underlying the measures for the 
30:824:57214:27:28:89:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:VSL. We must consider whether a person’s perceived health status influences the mix of 
30:825:57301:28:28:89:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumption goods and services selected, the amount and quality of leisure time selected, 
30:826:57391:28:27:89:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the net outcome of these factors on the measured extent of complementarity between 
30:827:57478:27:28:89:508:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the consumption and labor supplied to the market. These influences may become more 
30:828:57561:28:27:89:220:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:relevant as a person ages.   
30:829:57590:27:28:125:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our findings support the feasibility of using a sample of individuals in a panel 
30:830:57671:28:28:89:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:format to sort out some of the determinants of heterogeneous risk preferences, rather than 
30:831:57762:28:27:89:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:resorting to experts’ judgments as in the QALY literature.  The detailed records of actual 
30:832:57853:27:28:89:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:health conditions, subjective evaluations of perceived health status, and panel structure of 
30:833:57946:28:27:89:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the HRS allow us to demonstrate how it would be possible to measure the influence of 
30:834:58031:27:28:89:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:these factors on the relative size of different individuals’ risk tradeoffs. The next step is to 
30:835:58128:28:27:89:505:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:expand the samples considered beyond the older respondents in the HRS and evaluate 
30:836:58211:27:28:89:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:where analogous serious longevity threats and quality of life judgments affect younger 
30:837:58298:28:0:89:200:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:adults in similar ways.
