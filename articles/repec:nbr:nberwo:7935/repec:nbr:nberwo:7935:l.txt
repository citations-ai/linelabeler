3:40:2152:0:38:72:176:708:12:Times:12:Times:C:1. Introduction 
3:41:2166:38:25:108:542:670:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  phenomenon  of  "hot  IPO  markets"  has  been  recognized  for  a  long  time  in  the  financial 
3:42:2270:25:26:72:543:645:11:Times:11:Times:B:community.    Ibbotson  and  Jaffe  (1975)  and  Ibbotson,  Sindelar,  and  Ritter  (1988,  1994)  show  that  there 
3:43:2387:26:25:72:543:619:11:Times:11:Times:B:are  pronounced  cycles  in  the  number  of  new  issues  per  month,  cycles  in  the  average  initial  return  per 
3:44:2506:25:25:72:543:594:11:Times:11:Times:B:month,  and  also  an  apparent  lead-lag  relation  between  the  two  series.    Specifically,  periods  of  high  and 
3:45:2627:25:26:72:543:569:11:Times:11:Times:B:rising  initial  returns  tend  to  be  followed  by  spurts  of  IPOs.    Subsequent  to  these  periods  of  high  IPO 
3:46:2748:26:25:72:542:543:11:Times:11:Times:B:volume,  average  initial  returns  appear  to  decrease.    Figure  1  shows  monthly  IPO  volume  and  initial 
3:47:2862:25:25:72:542:518:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns  between  1960  and  1997,  and  this  pattern  is  repeated  many  times  over  the  38-year  period.    For 
3:48:2980:25:26:72:543:493:11:Times:11:Times:B:example, the high initial returns of early 1961 were followed by large numbers of companies going public 
3:49:3085:26:25:72:482:467:11:Times:11:Times:B:in late 1961 and early 1962, and then by especially low average initial returns in late 1962.    
3:50:3181:25:25:108:543:442:11:Times:11:Times:A:While Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975), Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988, 1994), and more recently 
3:51:3277:25:25:72:542:417:11:Times:11:Times:B:Cook,  Jarrell,  and  Kieschnick  (1999)  discuss  the  apparent  lead-lag  relations  between  IPO  volume  and 
3:52:3390:25:26:72:542:392:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns, none of these papers investigate the economics underlying these patterns.1  In contrast, our 
3:53:3500:26:25:72:542:366:11:Times:11:Times:B:objective is to examine the lead-lag relations between IPO volume and initial returns in more detail, with 
3:54:3607:25:25:72:484:341:11:Times:11:Times:B:a focus on both their statistical reliability and the economic factors that underlie these cycles. 
3:55:3705:25:26:103:542:316:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  contrast  to  the  impression  given  in  figure  1,  statistical  tests  show  only  weak  evidence  of  a 
3:56:3817:26:25:72:542:290:11:Times:11:Times:B:negative  relation  between  IPO  volume  and  future  initial  returns.    However, consistent with figure 1, we 
3:57:3931:25:25:72:543:265:11:Times:11:Times:B:find a significant positive relation between initial returns and future IPO volume.  As a first step towards 
3:58:4040:25:25:72:543:240:11:Times:11:Times:B:understanding  this  phenomenon,  we  examine  the  ways  in  which  private  companies  time  their  IPOs,  in 
3:59:4152:25:26:72:542:215:11:Times:11:Times:B:response to the initial returns of recent IPOs.  We find that the timing of IPO filings and IPO withdrawals 
3:60:4260:26:25:72:543:189:11:Times:11:Times:B:drives the positive relation between initial returns and future IPO volume.  More companies file IPOs and 
3:61:4366:25:44:72:375:164:11:Times:11:Times:B:fewer companies withdraw IPOs after periods of high initial returns. 
3:62:4434:44:7:72:219:120:10:Times:10:Times:F:                                                           
3:63:4492:7:16:72:542:113:6:Times:10:Times:F:1 Helwege and Liang (1996) examine the reasons that certain companies choose to go public during periods of high 
3:64:4605:16:11:72:542:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:versus low average initial returns.  However, both their dataset and the focus of their paper differ substantially from 
3:65:4725:11:12:72:543:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:ours.  They compare one year of high average initial returns with one year of low average initial returns and contrast 
3:66:4844:12:0:72:219:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:the types of firms in the two groups. 
4:67:4916:0:26:103:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:A:Given  the  strong  autocorrelation  in  initial  returns,  the  finding  that  more  companies  want  to  go 
4:68:5026:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:public when IPOs are being underpriced by the greatest amount is puzzling.   Assuming that firms prefer 
4:69:5130:25:25:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:to raise as much money in their IPO as possible, it would seem that companies would prefer to go public 
4:70:5234:25:26:72:543:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:when  initial  returns  were  the  lowest.    The  observed  pattern  suggests  that  high  initial  returns  contain 
4:71:5352:26:25:72:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:positive  information  for  private  companies  considering  an  IPO.    Perhaps  periods  of  high  initial  returns 
4:72:5470:25:25:72:543:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:represent times when the market values IPO firms more highly than the firms and their underwriters had 
4:73:5573:25:26:72:166:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:previously expected. 
4:74:5593:26:25:103:545:532:11:Times:11:Times:A:To learn about the information content of initial returns, we study the IPO pricing process in detail.  
4:75:5697:25:25:71:542:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:The  empirical  literature  on  IPOs  has  found  many  systematic  factors  that  explain  cross-sectional 
4:76:5805:25:25:72:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:differences  in  initial  returns.    For  example,  the  size  of  the  issuing  firm,  the  reputation  of  the  lead 
4:77:5925:25:26:72:542:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:investment  bank,  and  the  risk  of  the  IPO  stock  are  all  factors  that  partially  explain  initial  returns.    In 
4:78:6050:26:25:72:543:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:addition, the information that firms and their investment banks learn about the demand for the IPO stock 
4:79:6155:25:25:72:361:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:during the registration period is strongly related to initial returns. 
4:80:6225:25:26:107:542:381:11:Times:11:Times:A:By  examining  the  predictability  of  individual  firm  initial  returns,  we  are  able  to  provide  further 
4:81:6338:26:25:71:542:355:11:Times:11:Times:B:insight  on  the  cycles  in  average  initial  returns  over  time.    We  find  that  the  serial  correlation  in  initial 
4:82:6464:25:25:71:543:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns  is  driven  by  the  portion  of  initial  returns  that  is  predictable,  that  is,  by  changes  in the  types  of 
4:83:6591:25:26:71:542:305:11:Times:11:Times:B:firms  that  go  public  over  time  and,  more  importantly,  by  certain  information  about  firm  value  that 
4:84:6705:26:25:71:542:279:11:Times:11:Times:B:becomes available during the registration period but is not incorporated into the offer price.  Notably, the 
4:85:6814:25:25:71:542:254:11:Times:11:Times:B:serial correlation in initial returns is not driven by a slow reaction of issuing firms or investment bankers 
4:86:6924:25:25:71:542:229:11:Times:11:Times:B:to  market  demand  for  IPO  securities,  and  the  level  of  initial  returns  at  the  time  a  company  files  to  go 
4:87:7047:25:26:71:542:204:11:Times:11:Times:B:public contains no information about that company’s eventual underpricing.  A company can neither gain 
4:88:7150:26:25:71:542:178:11:Times:11:Times:B:nor  lose  in  terms  of  the  magnitude  of  its  underpricing  by  timing  its  IPO  relative  to  the  level  of  average 
4:89:7275:25:25:71:136:153:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns. 
4:90:7291:25:26:107:542:128:11:Times:11:Times:A:Finally,  we  find  that  the  positive  relation  between  initial  returns  and  subsequent  IPO  volume  is 
4:91:7402:26:25:71:542:102:11:Times:11:Times:B:similarly driven by the predictable portion of initial returns, specifically by information learned during the 
4:92:7513:25:0:71:542:77:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration period.  On the road show, the IPO firm and its underwriters glean information from informed 
5:93:7654:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:investors about their valuation of this new firm.  This information is a determinant of both the pricing of 
5:94:7762:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:that  IPO,  and  also  of  the  number  of  private  companies  that  find  it  optimal  to  issue  public  equity  in  the 
5:95:7886:25:25:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:near future.  More positive information in the form of higher expected valuations results in higher initial 
5:96:7994:25:26:72:357:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns and more companies filing to go public soon thereafter.   
5:97:8059:26:25:107:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  summary,  new  information  learned  during  the  registration  period  has  value  implications  for 
5:98:8165:25:25:71:543:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:both the number of future issues and for the pricing of those issues.  Notably, new information provided 
5:99:8270:25:26:71:542:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:by the secondary market on the first day of trading has no effect on either the pricing of future IPOs or the 
5:100:8380:26:25:71:185:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:number of future IPOs.    
5:101:8405:25:25:107:543:507:11:Times:11:Times:A:Section 2 discusses the data that we use to examine the time-series relations in IPO volume and 
5:102:8500:25:25:72:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns.    Section  3  investigates  the  statistical  properties  of  the  relations  between  IPO  volume  and 
5:103:8623:25:26:72:543:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:past  and  future  initial  returns.    In  section  4,  we  examine  the  extent  to  which  firms  and/or  their 
5:104:8738:26:25:72:542:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:underwriters manage the timing of the IPO process, conditional on the initial returns of other firms going 
5:105:8845:25:25:71:542:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:public.    Sections  5  and  6  examine  the  reasons  that  more  companies  go  public  after  observing  especially 
5:106:8964:25:26:71:542:381:11:Times:11:Times:B:high  average  initial  returns.    Specifically,  section  5  studies  several  firm  and  deal-specific  factors  that 
5:107:9085:26:25:72:543:355:11:Times:11:Times:B:influence the offer price, and section 6 employs these findings to investigate the determinants of the serial 
5:108:9195:25:25:72:545:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:correlation  of  IPO  initial  returns  and  of  the  lead-lag  relation  between  initial  returns  and  IPO  volume.  
5:109:9315:25:39:72:311:305:11:Times:11:Times:B:Finally, section 7 summarizes the results in the paper. 
5:110:9370:39:44:72:117:266:12:Times:12:Times:C:2. Data 
5:111:9376:44:25:108:543:222:11:Times:11:Times:A:To  study  the  behavior  of  aggregate  IPO  market  activity,  we  start  with  two  basic  sources  of  data 
5:112:9488:25:26:72:543:197:11:Times:11:Times:B:on  initial  returns  and  volume.    These  data  are  described  below.    In  later  sections  of  the  paper  we  also 
5:113:9611:26:0:72:451:171:11:Times:11:Times:B:examine initial returns at the firm level, and those data will be described at that point. 
6:114:9736:0:32:72:222:704:11:Times:11:Times:B:2.1 Data Sources and Definitions 
6:115:9768:32:28:108:543:672:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  Ibbotson,  Sindelar,  and  Ritter  (ISR)  data  [http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/ipoall.htm]  include 
6:116:9874:28:32:72:542:644:11:Times:11:Times:B:average,  equal-weighted  monthly  IPO  initial  returns  (IREWt)  and  the  number  of  IPOs  per  month 
6:117:9980:32:28:72:542:612:11:Times:11:Times:B:(NIPOISRt).  The exact sample composition and the calculation of initial returns differ somewhat over the 
6:118:10086:28:26:72:542:584:11:Times:11:Times:B:sample  period,  and  a  more  complete  description  of  the  procedures  used  to  calculate  these  statistics  is  in 
6:119:10208:26:25:72:543:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:Ibbotson,  Sindelar,  and  Ritter  (1994).    In  general,  ISR’s  initial  returns  represent  the  average,  across  all 
6:120:10331:25:25:72:543:533:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPOs  each  month,  of  the  percentage  difference  between  a  closing  price  within  the  first  month  after  the 
6:121:10450:25:26:72:542:508:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO  and  the  offer  price.    Each  IPO  is  weighted  equally,  so  that  IPOs  of  small  firms  have  the  same 
6:122:10567:26:25:72:218:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:influence as IPOs of large firms. 
6:123:10600:25:25:107:542:457:11:Times:11:Times:A:We  also  use  data  on  all  firm-commitment  IPOs  offered  or  filed  between  1985  and  1997  from 
6:124:10704:25:25:71:542:432:11:Times:11:Times:B:Securities Data Company (SDC).  Unit IPOs, closed end funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and 
6:125:10808:25:26:71:542:407:11:Times:11:Times:B:American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are excluded.  These data include the date the IPO was filed with 
6:126:10910:26:25:71:542:381:11:Times:11:Times:B:the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the range of prices within which the company expects to 
6:127:11012:25:25:72:543:356:11:Times:11:Times:B:price  the  issue  as  indicated  in  the  preliminary  prospectus  (file  range),  the  date  each  issue  is  offered  or 
6:128:11136:25:29:72:543:331:11:Times:11:Times:B:withdrawn,  the  offer  price,  and  the  prices  at  the  close  of  the  first  day,  second  day,  and  first  week  of 
6:129:11259:29:28:72:542:302:11:Times:11:Times:B:trading.    IPO  volume  is  defined  as  the  number  of  IPOs  each  month  (NIPOSDCt).    We  also  measure  the 
6:130:11375:28:26:72:546:274:11:Times:11:Times:B:number of offerings filed per month (NFILt) and the number of offerings withdrawn per month (NWDt).2  
6:131:11477:26:28:72:542:248:11:Times:11:Times:B:Finally, we calculate the average length of time in registration, equal to the number of days between the 
6:132:11583:28:29:72:422:220:11:Times:11:Times:B:filing and offer dates, weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO (REGTIMEPWt). 
6:133:11659:29:25:108:543:191:11:Times:11:Times:A:For the SDC sample, we measure both the initial return and the price update of each issue.  The 
6:134:11755:25:28:72:543:166:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial return equals the percentage change between the offer price and the first closing price, weighted by 
6:135:11864:28:41:72:521:138:11:Times:11:Times:B:proceeds raised in the IPO (IRPWt).  To determine the first closing price of a particular issue, the first  
6:136:11971:41:7:72:219:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:                                                           
6:137:12029:7:16:72:542:90:6:Times:10:Times:F:2  SDC  records  48  withdrawals  in  January,  1990,  compared  to  4  withdrawals  the previous  month  and  1  the 
6:138:12147:16:0:72:534:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:subsequent month.  We strongly suspect that this data point is incorrect, and therefore omit it from the time series.  
7:139:12300:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:closing price from the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) is used if price data are available 
7:140:12407:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:within 14 days of the offer date.  If CRSP data are not available, we try to obtain the closing price from 
7:141:12514:25:25:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:SDC.  The SDC closing price equals the close on the first day of trading.  If that is not available, the close 
7:142:12625:25:26:72:543:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:on the second day or otherwise the end of the first week of trading is used.  The price update between the 
7:143:12732:26:25:72:543:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial filing and the final offer is measured as the percentage difference between the midpoint of the file 
7:144:12841:25:28:72:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:range  and  the  offer  price.    The  average  price  update  for  offers  made  in  a  particular  month,  weighted  by 
7:145:12963:28:36:72:274:555:11:Times:11:Times:B:proceeds raised in the IPO, is denoted ∆PPWt. 
7:146:13008:36:31:72:184:519:11:Times:11:Times:B:2.2 Descriptive Statistics 
7:147:13034:31:25:108:543:488:11:Times:11:Times:A:Table  1  contains  the  mean,  median,  standard  deviation,  minimum,  and  maximum  of  the  various 
7:148:13138:25:26:72:546:463:11:Times:11:Times:B:data  series,  along  with  12  autocorrelations  and  the  large  sample  standard  error  of  the  autocorrelations.  
7:149:13258:26:25:72:543:437:11:Times:11:Times:B:Consistent with the earlier findings of Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) and Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988, 
7:150:13366:25:25:72:542:412:11:Times:11:Times:B:1994),  both  the  number  of  IPOs  and the  average  initial  returns  are  highly  autocorrelated.    Note  that  the 
7:151:13487:25:25:72:543:387:11:Times:11:Times:B:number of observations for initial returns is smaller than the sample size for the number of IPOs, since the 
7:152:13596:25:26:72:318:362:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial return is missing in months when no IPOs occur. 
7:153:13651:26:25:108:542:336:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  terms  of  the  number  of  IPOs,  in  the  1985-97  period  ISR's  data  include  more  issues,  but  the 
7:154:13762:25:25:72:542:311:11:Times:11:Times:B:general characteristics of the alternative measures NIPOISR, NIPOSDC, and NFIL are similar.  The number 
7:155:13866:25:26:72:548:286:11:Times:11:Times:B:of issues withdrawn (NWD) is small, and the time in registration for offers that occur averages 72.1 days.   
7:156:13975:26:25:72:543:260:11:Times:11:Times:B:REGTIME is not highly autocorrelated, indicating that the cyclical behavior of the number of IPOs is not 
7:157:14080:25:25:72:543:235:11:Times:11:Times:B:the result of variation in registration times.  Rather, it appears to be driven by the number of companies 
7:158:14187:25:29:72:489:210:11:Times:11:Times:B:filing and withdrawing offerings each month.  Further empirical tests support this proposition. 
7:159:14282:29:31:108:542:181:11:Times:11:Times:A:ISR's  measure  of  initial  returns  (IREWt)  is  higher  on  average  and  more  volatile  than  the  SDC 
7:160:14390:31:29:71:542:150:11:Times:11:Times:B:measure  of  initial  returns  (IRPWt).    This  is  most  likely  driven  by  two  factors:    first,  ISR’s  data  weight 
7:161:14514:29:25:71:542:121:11:Times:11:Times:B:small  issues  more  heavily,  and  second,  over  parts  of  the  sample  period  the  ISR  data  include  best  efforts 
7:162:14636:25:0:71:540:96:11:Times:11:Times:B:offerings and unit offerings, both of which tend to have higher than average initial returns.  For the 1985-
8:163:14779:0:26:72:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:97  period,  the  autocorrelations  of  initial  returns  are  highest  for  the  first  two  monthly  lags.    The 
8:164:14895:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:autocorrelations of initial returns from 1960-1997 are larger and more persistent (decaying from .60 to .11 
8:165:15003:25:28:72:179:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:between lags 1 and 12). 
8:166:15026:28:30:108:542:631:11:Times:11:Times:A:The average proceeds-weighted price update between the initial filing and the offering (∆PPWt) is 
8:167:15124:30:25:72:542:601:11:Times:11:Times:B:–3.6 percent, and the autocorrelation is large at lag one, but is small for higher order lags (less than .25 in 
8:168:15236:25:39:72:239:576:11:Times:11:Times:B:absolute value for lags 2 through 12). 
8:169:15274:39:38:72:346:537:12:Times:12:Times:C:3. The Relation Between Volume and Initial returns 
8:170:15323:38:25:108:542:499:11:Times:11:Times:A:Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1994) use the data in figure 1 to show that both IPO volume and 
8:171:15419:25:26:72:543:474:11:Times:11:Times:B:average  initial  returns  fluctuate  substantially  over  time  and  are  highly  autocorrelated.    Several  possible 
8:172:15539:26:31:72:428:448:11:Times:11:Times:B:explanations have been suggested for the cyclical pattern in each of these series. 
8:173:15621:31:31:72:146:417:11:Times:11:Times:B:3.1 IPO Volume 
8:174:15635:31:26:108:543:386:11:Times:11:Times:A:Lowry  (2000)  shows  that  the  observed  fluctuations  in  IPO  volume  are  related  to  three  distinct 
8:175:15743:26:25:72:543:360:11:Times:11:Times:B:factors:  changes in private firms’ aggregate demand for capital, changes in the adverse selection costs of 
8:176:15851:25:25:72:542:335:11:Times:11:Times:B:issuing  equity,  and  variation  in  investor  optimism.      First,  when  private  firms’  total  demands  for  capital 
8:177:15974:25:25:72:543:310:11:Times:11:Times:B:are higher, more companies tend to raise public equity for the first time.  Lee and Henderson (1999) also 
8:178:16080:25:26:72:542:285:11:Times:11:Times:B:find that changing business conditions contribute to the variation in IPO volume.  Second, a decrease in 
8:179:16185:26:25:72:543:259:11:Times:11:Times:B:market-wide  information  asymmetry  causes  the  adverse  selection  costs  of  issuing  equity  to  fall  and 
8:180:16297:25:25:72:543:234:11:Times:11:Times:B:consequently  more  firms  to  go  public.    Bayless  and  Chaplinsky  (1996)  and  Choe,  Masulis,  and  Nanda 
8:181:16410:25:26:72:542:209:11:Times:11:Times:B:(1993) similarly find that adverse selection costs affect the number of companies having seasoned equity 
8:182:16515:26:25:72:543:183:11:Times:11:Times:B:offerings over time.  Finally, when investors are especially optimistic, they are willing to overpay for IPO 
8:183:16624:25:25:72:542:158:11:Times:11:Times:B:firms  and  more  firms  will  therefore  have  IPOs.    Rajan  and  Servaes  (1997),  Lee,  Shleifer  and  Thaler 
8:184:16739:25:26:72:543:133:11:Times:11:Times:B:(1991) and Helwege and Liang (1996) provide additional evidence that IPO volume is positively related 
8:185:16841:26:25:72:543:107:11:Times:11:Times:B:to the level of investor sentiment, and Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998) reach a similar conclusion in 
8:186:16948:25:0:72:237:82:11:Times:11:Times:B:an examination of the Italian market. 
9:187:17020:0:26:108:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:A:More  generally,  Stoughton,  Wong,  and  Zechner  (2000)  posit  that  IPO  clustering  is  the  result  of 
9:188:17129:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:information effects.  They develop a model in which one firm’s IPO provides information about industry 
9:189:17232:25:31:72:397:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:prospects, thus causing many similar companies to go public soon after.   
9:190:17305:31:32:72:153:628:11:Times:11:Times:B:3.2 Initial returns 
9:191:17324:32:25:108:546:596:11:Times:11:Times:A:Variation  in  average  IPO  initial  returns  can  also  be  caused  by  a  number  of  different  factors.  
9:192:17434:25:25:72:543:571:11:Times:11:Times:B:Ritter  (1984)  finds  that  underwriter  monopsony  power  and  differences  in  the  average  risk  of  companies 
9:193:17550:25:26:72:542:546:11:Times:11:Times:B:going  public  are  important.    Specifically,  the  higher  average  initial  returns  during  the  early  1980s  were 
9:194:17671:26:25:72:543:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:driven by a large number of small, risky, natural resource companies going public and by the underwriters 
9:195:17777:25:25:72:542:495:11:Times:11:Times:B:of  these  IPOs  systematically  pricing  them  far  below their  subsequent  market  value.    In  addition,  Ritter 
9:196:17895:25:25:72:542:470:11:Times:11:Times:B:(1991) provides evidence that investor over-reaction during certain periods contributes to the fluctuations 
9:197:18003:25:26:72:543:445:11:Times:11:Times:B:in initial returns.  When investors are over-optimistic, they bid up the after-market price of the IPO firms, 
9:198:18113:26:31:72:258:419:11:Times:11:Times:B:resulting in especially high initial returns. 
9:199:18158:31:31:72:259:388:11:Times:11:Times:B:3.3 Information Spillover and IPO Cycles 
9:200:18198:31:26:108:543:357:11:Times:11:Times:A:Neither changes in the average risk of companies going public nor time-variation in underwriter 
9:201:18294:26:25:72:542:331:11:Times:11:Times:B:monopsony  power  seem  likely  to  cause  initial  returns  to  be positively  correlated  with  subsequent  IPO 
9:202:18408:25:25:72:543:306:11:Times:11:Times:B:volume  or  negatively  correlated  with  lagged  IPO  volume.    However,  it  is  plausible  that  initial  returns 
9:203:18526:25:26:72:543:281:11:Times:11:Times:B:contain  some  type  of  valuable  information.    For  example,  van  Bommel  and  Vermaelen  (2000)  find  that 
9:204:18640:26:25:72:543:255:11:Times:11:Times:B:firms  with  higher  first-day  returns  spend  more  money  on  investment  after  the  IPO.    This  finding  is 
9:205:18755:25:25:72:543:230:11:Times:11:Times:B:consistent with the idea that initial returns are positively related to the market’s assessment of the firm’s 
9:206:18865:25:25:72:288:205:11:Times:11:Times:B:prospects, and firms respond to this information. 
9:207:18914:25:26:108:542:180:11:Times:11:Times:A:More  generally,  average  initial  returns  across  all  IPOs  in  a  given  period  probably  contain 
9:208:19018:26:25:72:543:154:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  on  investor  sentiment  or  on  growth  prospects  at  that  time.    If  high  average  initial  returns 
9:209:19138:25:0:72:542:129:11:Times:11:Times:B:indicate that sentiment is especially high or market conditions better than expected, then more companies 
10:210:19279:0:26:72:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:are  likely  to  subsequently  go  public.3    To  the  extent  that  high  initial  returns  indicate  that  private 
10:211:19397:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:companies  can  raise  more  money  in  an  IPO  than  they  previously  thought,  high  initial  returns  will  be 
10:212:19513:25:25:72:249:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:followed by periods of high volume.      
10:213:19553:25:26:107:542:634:11:Times:11:Times:A:Similar  theories  can  explain  the  negative  relation  between  IPO  volume  and  subsequent  initial 
10:214:19658:26:25:71:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns.  For example, as more firms go public, the uncertainty surrounding the true value of these firms 
10:215:19764:25:25:71:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:decreases,  thus  causing  average  initial  returns  to  decrease.    In  a  similar  spirit,  Benveniste,  Busaba,  and 
10:216:19886:25:26:71:542:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:Wilhelm  (1999)  and  Booth  and  Chua  (1996)  model  initial  returns  as  compensation  to  investors  for 
10:217:19996:26:25:71:542:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:learning  the  true  value  of  firms.    As  an  example,  Benveniste,  Busaba  and  Wilhelm  note  that  Netscape’s 
10:218:20114:25:25:71:542:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:especially  high  initial  return  is  consistent  with  this  idea  that  initial  returns  represent  compensation  for 
10:219:20236:25:25:71:542:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  gathering,  as  Netscape  was  one  of  the  first  internet  IPOs.    When  IPO  volume  is  high,  these 
10:220:20356:25:32:71:426:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:costs are shared among many firms, causing average initial returns to be lower.  
10:221:20436:32:31:71:265:425:11:Times:11:Times:B:3.4 Evidence on Initial returns and Volume 
10:222:20478:31:25:107:542:394:11:Times:11:Times:A:Figure 2 shows the cross correlations between initial returns in month t and IPO volume in month 
10:223:20575:25:29:71:542:369:11:Times:11:Times:B:t+k for several versions of these variables, for 12 months before and after the month of the IPO.  Panel A 
10:224:20682:29:28:71:542:340:11:Times:11:Times:B:uses Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter’s (ISR) data for 1960-1997, IREWt and NIPOISRkt+.  Consistent with the 
10:225:20789:28:26:72:542:312:11:Times:11:Times:B:impressions  from  figure  1,  these  data  show  a  strong  pattern  of  negative  correlations  between  current 
10:226:20904:26:25:72:543:286:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns  and  past  numbers  of  IPOs,  along  with  strong  positive  correlations  between  current  initial 
10:227:21024:25:25:72:233:261:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns and future numbers of IPOs. 
10:228:21059:25:25:108:542:236:11:Times:11:Times:A:Panel  B  shows  that  the  cross-correlations  are  somewhat  sensitive  to  the  measurement  of  initial 
10:229:21167:25:26:71:540:211:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns.  Using data over the 1985 – 1997 period, we are able to measure initial returns on both an equal-
10:230:21273:26:25:72:542:185:11:Times:11:Times:B:weighted and a value-weighted basis.  Specifically, when initial returns are equal-weighted, the relations 
10:231:21380:25:25:72:542:160:11:Times:11:Times:B:are  similar  to  those  shown  in  Panel  A  over  the  longer  time  period.    Initial  returns  are  significantly 
10:232:21499:25:27:72:543:135:11:Times:11:Times:B:negatively  correlated  with  past  IPO  volume  and  significantly  positively  correlated  with  future  IPO 
10:233:21610:27:11:72:75:108:10:Times:6:Times:F:                                                           3
10:234:21669:11:11:75:542:97:10:Times:10:Times:F: Benveniste, Wilhelm, and Yu (1999) find that issuing firms structure their IPOs conditional on various features of 
10:235:21785:11:12:72:524:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:recent offerings; for example, actual proceeds raised compared to expected proceeds as stated in the prospectus.  
10:236:21898:12:0:72:75:74:10:Times:10:Times:F: 
11:237:21933:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:volume.    Notably,  when  initial  returns  are  value-weighted,  we  see  that  initial  returns  are  less  strongly 
11:238:22053:26:28:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:related to past IPO volume, but the cross-correlations between initial returns and future IPO volume have 
11:239:22159:28:29:72:543:656:11:Times:11:Times:B:an even greater magnitude.  The cross-correlations using initial returns and the number of filings, IRPWt 
11:240:22264:29:25:72:542:627:11:Times:11:Times:B:and NFILt+k, are similar, but shifted by about one month (so returns to IPOs filed in month t are related to 
11:241:22373:25:25:72:543:602:11:Times:11:Times:B:the number of IPOs filed in months t+1 and beyond).  This is consistent with the lag between the time an 
11:242:22478:25:26:72:237:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO is filed and the time of the offer. 
11:243:22517:26:25:108:545:551:11:Times:11:Times:A:These cross-correlations suggest that there is a difference in the behavior of small and large IPOs.  
11:244:22619:25:25:72:543:526:11:Times:11:Times:B:These figures are descriptive in nature, however, and one must be cautious in drawing conclusions from 
11:245:22722:25:25:72:542:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:them.    To  test  the  statistical  significance  of  these  relations,  we  use  second  order  vector  autoregressive 
11:246:22843:25:26:72:543:476:11:Times:11:Times:B:(VAR)  models.    The  VAR  models  allow  for  the  substantial  serial  correlation  in  both  initial  returns  and 
11:247:22962:26:25:72:542:450:11:Times:11:Times:B:volume that can make inferences about the cross-correlations in figure 2 difficult.  These models enable 
11:248:23067:25:25:72:543:425:11:Times:11:Times:B:us  to  test  the  incremental  predictive  ability  of  lagged  initial  returns  to  predict  future  volume  and  vice 
11:249:23189:25:26:72:542:400:11:Times:11:Times:B:versa.  Such tests are referred to as Granger (1969) F-tests, since he suggested and popularized them.  The 
11:250:23297:26:25:72:359:374:11:Times:11:Times:B:VAR models as well as the Granger F-tests are shown in table 2. 
11:251:23360:25:25:108:540:349:11:Times:11:Times:A:The left and middle panels of table 2 show results for ISR's equal-weighted data over the 1960-
11:252:23455:25:26:72:542:324:11:Times:11:Times:B:1997  and  1985-97  periods,  and  the  right  panel  is  based  on  proceeds-weighted  SDC  data  between  1985 
11:253:23568:26:25:72:543:298:11:Times:11:Times:B:and 1997.  These tests confirm that there is a significant positive relation between initial returns and the 
11:254:23677:25:25:72:542:273:11:Times:11:Times:B:future  number  of  IPOs.    Using  either  time  period  and  either  equal-weighted  or  value-weighted  initial 
11:255:23792:25:25:72:542:248:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns, Granger F-tests strongly reject the hypothesis that two lags of IPO initial returns have no power 
11:256:23899:25:26:72:543:223:11:Times:11:Times:B:to predict IPO volume, with p-values for these tests all below 0.01.  In contrast, the relation between the 
11:257:24007:26:25:72:543:197:11:Times:11:Times:B:number of IPOs and future initial returns is negative, but not significant at conventional levels.  Thus, the 
11:258:24117:25:25:72:542:172:11:Times:11:Times:B:impression  from  figure  2  that  higher  numbers  of  IPOs  are  associated  with  lower  average  returns  in  the 
11:259:24235:25:0:72:543:147:11:Times:11:Times:B:future is somewhat misleading.  Also, the impression from figure 2 of a difference between the behavior 
12:260:24375:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:of  small  and  large  IPOs  is  more  apparent  than  real.4    The  cross-correlations  in  figure  2  are  misleading 
12:261:24496:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:because both initial returns and IPO volume are highly autocorrelated.  Tests using 6 and 12 lags in the 
12:262:24601:25:25:72:282:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:VAR models yield qualitatively similar results. 
12:263:24648:25:26:108:540:634:11:Times:11:Times:A:Thus,  the  F-tests  in  table  2  strengthen  and  formalize  the  impression  given  by  the  cross-
12:264:24750:26:25:72:546:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:correlations  in  figure  2  that  past  initial  returns  have  a  significant  positive  effect  on  future  IPO  volume.  
12:265:24875:25:38:72:460:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:However, past IPO volume plays a weak role, if any, in predicting future initial returns. 
12:266:24964:38:39:72:348:545:12:Times:12:Times:C:4.   Do Firms Manage the Timing of the IPO Process? 
12:267:25014:39:25:108:543:506:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  strong  positive  relation  between  initial  returns  and  subsequent  IPO  volume  suggests  that 
12:268:25119:25:26:72:543:481:11:Times:11:Times:B:companies  are  timing  their  IPOs  in  response  to  the  size  of  recent  initial  returns.    High  initial  returns 
12:269:25241:26:25:72:542:455:11:Times:11:Times:B:appear to represent good news and therefore be followed by increased numbers of IPOs.  In this section, 
12:270:25345:25:25:72:481:430:11:Times:11:Times:B:we look more specifically at the potential firm actions that could contribute to this relation.   
12:271:25442:25:25:108:543:405:11:Times:11:Times:A:There  are  three  ways  that  companies  and/or  underwriters  can  affect  the  timing  of  the  IPO  in 
12:272:25549:25:26:72:542:380:11:Times:11:Times:B:response to recent IPO initial returns.  First, companies must file the issue.  Second, they have the option 
12:273:25658:26:25:72:543:354:11:Times:11:Times:B:to change the planned issue date.  A delay would extend the amount of time between the filing date and 
12:274:25761:25:25:72:542:329:11:Times:11:Times:B:the  offer  date.    Third,  they  have  the  option  to cancel  the  issue.    This  section  examines  the  relations 
12:275:25881:25:26:72:543:304:11:Times:11:Times:B:between  average  initial  returns  and  the  number  of  IPO  filings,  the  average  registration  time,  and  the 
12:276:25998:26:25:72:216:278:11:Times:11:Times:B:proportion of IPO cancellations. 
12:277:26030:25:25:108:542:253:11:Times:11:Times:A:If  high  initial  returns  provide  positive  information  about  the  market’s  valuation  of  IPOs,  then 
12:278:26139:25:25:72:543:228:11:Times:11:Times:B:more private companies should file IPOs after periods of high initial returns.  Thus, initial returns should 
12:279:26248:25:26:72:543:203:11:Times:11:Times:B:be positively correlated with the number of subsequent filings.  In contrast, we expect initial returns to be 
12:280:26358:26:25:72:542:177:11:Times:11:Times:B:negatively  related  to  the  number  of  subsequent  cancellations.    If  large  average  initial  returns  represent 
12:281:26478:25:44:72:510:152:11:Times:11:Times:B:positive information for a company considering an IPO, then fewer firms should cancel IPOs after  
12:282:26575:44:11:72:75:108:10:Times:6:Times:F:                                                           4
12:283:26634:11:11:75:542:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:  The  finding  of  no  significant  relation  between  IPO  volume  and  future  initial  returns  contrasts  with  the  results  of 
12:284:26768:11:12:72:542:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:Booth  and  Chua  (1996).    However,  their  results  are  based  on  cross-sectional  regressions  that  do  not  consider  the 
12:285:26898:12:0:72:291:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:autocorrelation in either IPO volume or initial returns. 
13:286:26990:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:observing  such  returns.    Similar  factors  would  cause  initial  returns  to  be  negatively  correlated  with  the 
13:287:27111:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:average registration time of subsequent IPOs.  When average initial returns are high, companies have an 
13:288:27215:25:25:72:543:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:incentive  to  expedite  the  offering  process,  meaning  that  high  (low)  initial  returns  will  be  followed  by 
13:289:27334:25:26:72:225:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:shorter (longer) registration times. 
13:290:27370:26:25:108:543:608:11:Times:11:Times:A:Finally, we also examine whether filing, deferral, and withdrawal decisions forecast future initial 
13:291:27470:25:25:72:543:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns.  Even though table 2 provides little evidence that the number of IPOs predicts subsequent initial 
13:292:27577:25:26:72:543:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns, the timing of the ultimate offering represents the outcome of several earlier decisions on the part 
13:293:27686:26:25:72:543:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:of the firm.  It is possible that the behavior of firms in managing the speed of their IPOs through filing, 
13:294:27794:25:25:72:542:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:deferral,  and  withdrawal  decisions  could  forecast  future  returns.    For  example,  consider  the  information 
13:295:27912:25:25:72:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:spillover  models  of  Booth  and  Chua  (1996)  and  Benveniste,  Busaba  and  Wilhelm  (1999),  that  initial 
13:296:28024:25:26:72:542:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns  compensate  investors  for  the  costly  information-gathering  process.    When  more  companies  go 
13:297:28135:26:25:72:542:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:public, the incremental costs of gathering information about each company are lower, meaning that initial 
13:298:28241:25:25:72:543:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns are lower.  Thus, as more companies file IPOs and fewer companies cancel IPOs, the total costs of 
13:299:28347:25:26:72:542:381:11:Times:11:Times:B:learning  about  this  class  of  companies  is  shared between  a  greater  number  of  issues,  meaning  that  the 
13:300:28464:26:25:72:543:355:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns of each will be lower.  This suggests that higher numbers of filings and fewer withdrawals 
13:301:28571:25:25:72:319:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:will be associated with lower subsequent initial returns. 
13:302:28628:25:29:108:543:305:11:Times:11:Times:A:Table 3 contains Granger F-tests from second order VAR models (similar to table 2) relating two 
13:303:28724:29:31:72:543:276:11:Times:11:Times:B:measures  of  initial  returns  (IREWt  and  IRPWt)  with  past  and  future  measures  of  IPO  timing.  NFIL  is  the 
13:304:28844:31:29:72:542:245:11:Times:11:Times:B:number  of  offerings  filed  per  month.    REGTIMEPWtis  the  average  length  of  time  in  days  between  the 
13:305:28958:29:25:72:543:216:11:Times:11:Times:B:filing date and the offer date for all issues offered in month t.  NWD* is the number of offers withdrawn 
13:306:29064:25:25:72:394:191:11:Times:11:Times:B:in month t, scaled by the number of issues filed in the prior four months. 
13:307:29138:25:26:108:542:166:11:Times:11:Times:A:The statistical tests in table 3 (rows 1, 3, and 5) indicate that the positive relation between initial 
13:308:29242:26:25:72:543:140:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns  and  the  number  of  IPOs  is  driven  by  the  timing  of  firm  filings,  and  possibly  the  timing  of  offer 
13:309:29366:25:25:72:543:115:11:Times:11:Times:B:withdrawals.  Consistent with the evidence in figure 2, both equal-weighted and value-weighted average 
13:310:29469:25:0:72:542:90:11:Times:11:Times:B:monthly initial returns are significantly positively related to the number of subsequent IPO filings (F-tests 
14:311:29615:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:have p-values of 0.000 and 0.003, respectively).  Also, proceeds-weighted (but not equal-weighted) initial 
14:312:29722:26:25:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns are strongly related to future withdrawals (p-value = 0.008).  Fewer companies withdraw offerings 
14:313:29828:25:28:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:following  periods  of  high  initial  returns.    Finally,  although  there  is  some  evidence  that  equal-weighted 
14:314:29947:28:29:72:542:631:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns  predict  timing  (p-value of  0.008  using  IRPWt),  the  coefficients  of  the  VAR  models  (not 
14:315:30064:29:25:72:543:602:11:Times:11:Times:B:shown)  are  positive  for  lagged  initial  returns.    This  implies  that  high  initial  returns  are  associated  with 
14:316:30188:25:26:72:542:577:11:Times:11:Times:B:longer registration times in future months, a result which seems inconsistent with the evidence that initial 
14:317:30297:26:25:72:357:551:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns represent good news for companies considering an IPO.  
14:318:30359:25:25:108:543:526:11:Times:11:Times:A:The analysis of the various measures of IPO timing and future initial returns is shown in rows 2, 
14:319:30457:25:25:72:543:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:4,  and  6  of  table  3.    There  is  no  evidence  of  any  significant  relation  between  either  IPO  filings  or  IPO 
14:320:30582:25:29:72:543:476:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration time and subsequent initial returns.  However, there is some evidence that withdrawals predict 
14:321:30690:29:28:72:542:447:11:Times:11:Times:B:equal-weighted  initial  returns  (p-value  of  0.009  using  IREWt).    Consistent with the information spillover 
14:322:30805:28:26:72:543:419:11:Times:11:Times:B:models,  fewer  withdrawals  are  associated  with  lower  initial  returns  in  future  months.    When  more  firms 
14:323:30923:26:25:72:543:393:11:Times:11:Times:B:go public (fewer firms withdraw offerings), initial returns are lower because investors’ incremental costs 
14:324:31030:25:25:72:328:368:11:Times:11:Times:B:of gathering information about each company are lower.   
14:325:31086:25:26:108:543:343:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  summary,  the  relation  between  initial  returns  and  future  IPO  volume  is  driven  by  more 
14:326:31189:26:25:72:543:317:11:Times:11:Times:B:companies filing IPOs after periods of high initial returns and possibly by the likelihood of cancellation, 
14:327:31297:25:25:72:542:292:11:Times:11:Times:B:not  by  variation  in  the  length  of  registration.    Also,  after  looking  in  more  detail  at  the  IPO  process,  we 
14:328:31423:25:39:72:523:267:11:Times:11:Times:B:find some evidence of a relation between the frequency of issue cancellation and future initial returns. 
14:329:31527:39:38:72:317:228:12:Times:12:Times:C:5. The Information Content of Initial Returns  
14:330:31572:38:25:108:542:190:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  fact  that  more  companies  file  to  go  public  and  fewer  companies  withdraw  their  offerings 
14:331:31678:25:26:72:543:165:11:Times:11:Times:B:after  observing  that  recent  IPOs  have  earned  especially  high  initial  returns  suggests  that  initial  returns 
14:332:31799:26:25:72:542:139:11:Times:11:Times:B:contain valuable information for private companies considering an IPO.  This section, along with section 
14:333:31904:25:25:72:543:114:11:Times:11:Times:B:6, examines the pricing process of IPOs in more detail, in the hope of learning more about the information 
14:334:32011:25:0:72:183:89:11:Times:11:Times:B:content of initial returns. 
15:335:32074:0:26:108:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:A:Initial returns, by definition, equal the difference between the underwriters' valuation of the firm, 
15:336:32176:26:25:72:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:the  offer  price,  and  the  secondary  market's  valuation.    However,  prior  evidence  shows  that  underwriters 
15:337:32294:25:25:72:543:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:do  not  fully  incorporate  all  available  information  into  the  offer  price.    Initial  returns  represent  some 
15:338:32414:25:26:72:542:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:information known ahead of time by the underwriter plus some incremental information provided by the 
15:339:32515:26:25:72:543:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:market.    This  section  examines  the  entire  IPO  pricing  process,  beginning  at  the  time  the  IPO  is  filed,  in 
15:340:32639:25:25:72:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:the hope of identifying the various sources of information contained in initial returns.  Section 6 employs 
15:341:32747:25:26:72:543:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:the results of this analysis to investigate which types of information private companies find most relevant 
15:342:32855:26:31:72:246:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:in their decisions of when to go public. 
15:343:32895:31:31:72:255:501:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.1 Overview of the IPO Pricing Process 
15:344:32934:31:25:108:542:470:11:Times:11:Times:A:When  a  company  files  an  IPO,  it  must  file  a  prospectus  containing  a  range  of  anticipated  IPO 
15:345:33043:25:26:72:543:445:11:Times:11:Times:B:prices.  During the registration period, the company and its underwriter go on a road show to market the 
15:346:33148:26:25:72:545:419:11:Times:11:Times:B:issue to institutional investors, and these investors have the opportunity to express interest in the offering.  
15:347:33261:25:25:72:543:394:11:Times:11:Times:B:If the investors accurately reveal their private information through these expressions of interest, then the 
15:348:33370:25:26:72:543:369:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  exchange  will  contribute  to  a  more  accurate  pricing  of  the  new  issue.    However,  these 
15:349:33483:26:25:72:543:343:11:Times:11:Times:B:investors can potentially benefit by not revealing positive information about a new issue, causing the offer 
15:350:33592:25:25:72:543:318:11:Times:11:Times:B:price  to  be  set  too  low  and  enabling  them  (assuming  they  buy  in  at  the  offer  price)  to  reap  significant 
15:351:33715:25:26:72:542:293:11:Times:11:Times:B:gains.    To  protect  themselves  against  this  potential  loss,  Benveniste  and  Spindt  (1989)  hypothesize  that 
15:352:33834:26:25:72:543:267:11:Times:11:Times:B:underwriters only partially incorporate positive information learned during the registration period into the 
15:353:33943:25:25:72:543:242:11:Times:11:Times:B:final  offer  price.    This  ensures  the  investors  of  some  positive  return  as  compensation  for  revealing  their 
15:354:34066:25:25:72:545:217:11:Times:11:Times:B:private  information,  but  also  enables  underwriters  and  the  newly  public  company  to  share  in  the  gains.  
15:355:34185:25:26:72:543:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:Consistent  with  this  theory,  Hanley  (1993)  finds  a  significant  positive  relation  between  a  firm’s  price 
15:356:34303:26:25:72:542:166:11:Times:11:Times:B:update and its initial return.  Evidently, initial returns consist of some information known ahead of time, 
15:357:34411:25:25:72:408:141:11:Times:11:Times:B:as well as some incremental information provided by the secondary market. 
15:358:34484:25:26:108:543:116:11:Times:11:Times:A:Loughran  and  Ritter  (1999)  note  that  Benveniste  and  Spindt’s  model  implies  that  underwriters 
15:359:34589:26:0:72:543:90:11:Times:11:Times:B:should  only  partially  incorporate private  information  learned  about  firm  value  during  the  registration 
16:360:34739:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:period,  but  that public  information  should  be  fully  reflected  in  the  offer  price.    However,  Loughran  and 
16:361:34859:26:25:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:Ritter  find  that  there  are  strong  positive  correlations  between  the  pre-offer  market  return  and  the  price 
16:362:34980:25:25:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:update  and  also  between  the  pre-offer  market  return  and  the  initial  IPO  return,  indicating  that  the  price 
16:363:35102:25:26:72:543:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:adjustment  to  this publicly  available  information  is  only  partial.    In  other  words,  the  partial  adjustment 
16:364:35223:26:25:72:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:phenomenon  discussed  by  Benveniste  and  Spindt  exists  for  observable  public  information,  such  as  the 
16:365:35336:25:25:72:355:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:market return, even though their theory would not predict this.   
16:366:35401:25:26:108:543:558:11:Times:11:Times:A:Finally,  Beatty  and  Ritter  (1986),  Megginson  and  Weiss  (1991),  and  Koh  and  Walter  (1989), 
16:367:35504:26:25:72:542:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:among others, show that initial returns are significantly related to a variety of firm-specific characteristics, 
16:368:35617:25:25:72:311:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:many of which are known at the time the IPO is filed. 
16:369:35670:25:25:108:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  summary,  prior  evidence  indicates  that  the  initial  return  consists  of  information  related  to  the 
16:370:35784:25:26:72:542:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:type  of  firm  going  public,  private  and  public  information  learned  during  the  registration  period  but  not 
16:371:35904:26:25:71:542:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:fully incorporated into the offer price, and finally the new information that is provided by the secondary 
16:372:36011:25:25:71:542:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:market when the issue starts trading.  This section considers these sources of information in more detail, 
16:373:36118:25:26:72:543:381:11:Times:11:Times:B:in the hope of discerning which information companies rely on most heavily in their decisions of when to 
16:374:36223:26:25:72:542:355:11:Times:11:Times:B:go  public.    Our  finding  of  a  significant  positive  relation  between  average  initial  returns  and  subsequent 
16:375:36344:25:25:71:542:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO volume indicates that at least one of these information sources represents an important determinant of 
16:376:36451:25:32:71:194:305:11:Times:11:Times:B:the timing of firms’ IPOs.   
16:377:36479:32:31:71:320:273:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.2 Data on Individual IPOs and Sample Selection Bias 
16:378:36532:31:25:107:542:242:11:Times:11:Times:A:To  estimate  the  portion  of  initial  returns  that  represents  information  known  ahead  of  time,  we 
16:379:36641:25:25:71:542:217:11:Times:11:Times:B:analyze the predictability of initial returns at the firm level.  We use SDC and CRSP data from 1985-97 to 
16:380:36748:25:26:71:542:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:investigate these relations, and this section discusses these data.  The empirical tests are found in sections 
16:381:36859:26:25:71:126:166:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.3 and 5.4. 
16:382:36871:25:25:107:244:141:11:Times:11:Times:A:The variables we use include:  
16:383:36901:25:19:107:510:116:11:Times:11:Times:A:(1) IR,  the  Initial  return,  equals  the  percentage  change  between  the  offer  price  and  the 
16:384:37002:19:19:134:383:97:11:Times:11:Times:A:first closing price (previously described in section 2.1);  
16:385:37061:19:0:107:441:78:11:Times:11:Times:A:(2) RANK is the underwriter rank, from Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998); 
17:386:37166:0:19:108:397:710:11:Times:11:Times:A:(3) TA equals the logarithm of real total assets before the IPO; 
17:387:37229:19:19:108:511:691:11:Times:11:Times:A:(4) NYSE  equals  one  if  the  IPO  is  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  and  zero 
17:388:37325:19:19:135:183:672:11:Times:11:Times:A:otherwise; 
17:389:37335:19:19:108:511:653:11:Times:11:Times:A:(5) NASDAQ  equals  one  if  the  IPO  is  listed  on  the  Nasdaq  National  Market  System, 
17:390:37428:19:19:135:224:634:11:Times:11:Times:A:and zero otherwise; 
17:391:37447:19:19:108:511:615:11:Times:11:Times:A:(6) AMEX  equals  one  if  the  IPO  is  listed  on  the  American  Stock  Exchange,  and  zero 
17:392:37542:19:19:135:183:596:11:Times:11:Times:A:otherwise; 
17:393:37552:19:19:108:511:577:11:Times:11:Times:A:(7) TECH  equals  one  if  the  firm  is  in  a  high  tech  industry  [biotech,  computer 
17:394:37642:19:19:135:511:558:11:Times:11:Times:A:equipment,  electronics,  communications,  and  general  technology  (as  defined  by 
17:395:37728:19:19:135:258:539:11:Times:11:Times:A:SDC)], and zero otherwise; 
17:396:37754:19:19:108:511:520:11:Times:11:Times:A:(8) VOL is the market-adjusted volatility of the IPO stock return, equal to the standard 
17:397:37842:19:19:135:511:501:11:Times:11:Times:A:deviation of daily returns to the IPO stock in trading days 1 through 63 after the IPO 
17:398:37929:19:19:135:511:482:11:Times:11:Times:A:(the first three months of secondary market trading) minus the standard deviation of 
17:399:38014:19:20:135:492:463:11:Times:11:Times:A:daily returns to the CRSP equal-weighted market index during the same period;5 
17:400:38092:20:19:108:511:443:11:Times:11:Times:A:(9) ∆P  is  the percentage  change  between  middle  of  the  range  of  prices  in  the  initial 
17:401:38189:19:20:135:319:424:11:Times:11:Times:A:registration statement and the offer price; 
17:402:38232:20:20:108:511:404:11:Times:11:Times:A:(10) ∆P+ equals ∆P when it is positive, and zero otherwise (to capture asymmetric effects 
17:403:38320:20:19:135:215:384:11:Times:11:Times:A:of price updates); 
17:404:38338:19:18:108:511:365:11:Times:11:Times:A:(11) MKT  is  the  return  to  the  CRSP  equal-weighted  portfolio  of  NYSE,  Amex,  and 
17:405:38428:18:19:135:510:347:11:Times:11:Times:A:Nasdaq-listed stocks for the period between the initial filing date and the final offer 
17:406:38516:19:19:135:180:328:11:Times:11:Times:A:date, and  
17:407:38526:19:19:108:510:309:11:Times:11:Times:A:(12) MKT+ equals  MKT  when  it  is positive,  and  zero  otherwise  (again,  to  capture 
17:408:38614:19:25:135:228:290:11:Times:11:Times:A:asymmetric effects). 
17:409:38634:25:32:72:307:265:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.3 Regression Models for Firm-level Initial Returns 
17:410:38686:32:25:108:543:233:11:Times:11:Times:A:It is well known that the percent change between the offer price and the secondary market price 
17:411:38782:25:25:72:542:208:11:Times:11:Times:B:(the initial return) is large on average, but also highly variable across firms.  Table 4 contains estimates of 
17:412:38894:25:26:72:293:183:11:Times:11:Times:B:regression models that explain this initial return,   
17:413:38947:26:29:108:472:157:11:Times:11:Times:A:IRi  =  α  +  β1 RANKi  +  β2 TAi  +  β3 NYSEi  +  β4 NASDAQi  + β5 AMEXi  +   
17:414:39025:29:28:108:543:128:11:Times:11:Times:A: β6 TECHi  +  β7 VOLi  +  β8 ∆Pi  +  β9 ∆P+i + β10 MKTi  +  β11 MKT+i +  εi,  (1) 
17:415:39102:28:7:72:219:100:10:Times:10:Times:F:                                                           
17:416:39160:7:16:72:542:93:6:Times:10:Times:F:5 As a robustness check, we also used a measure of market-adjusted volatility based on returns between 22 and 63 
17:417:39273:16:0:72:405:77:10:Times:10:Times:F:days after the IPO.  The results were qualitatively similar, so they are not reported. 
18:418:39395:0:26:72:280:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:where the variables have been defined above.   
18:419:39441:26:25:108:543:684:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  rank  of  the  investment  banker  (RANK),  the  size  of  the  IPO  firm  (TA),  the  exchange  on 
18:420:39546:25:26:72:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:which the new issue will trade (NYSE, Nasdaq, or AMEX), and the firm’s industry (TECH) are known at 
18:421:39646:26:26:72:542:633:11:Times:11:Times:B:the time of the initial prospectus.  The price update (∆P) is known at the time the IPO price is set, as is the 
18:422:39758:26:26:72:542:607:11:Times:11:Times:B:market return that occurred during the registration period (MKT).  Only the after-market volatility of the 
18:423:39865:26:25:72:542:581:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO  stock  returns  (VOL)  is  not  observable  at  the  time  the  IPO  is  priced.    This  variable  has often  been 
18:424:39986:25:25:72:543:556:11:Times:11:Times:B:used  to  represent  the  risk  of  the  IPO  stock,  and  is  generally  presumed  to  be  an  unbiased  estimate  of 
18:425:40105:25:25:72:416:531:11:Times:11:Times:B:information that is available to investors (but not to econometricians) ex ante. 
18:426:40185:25:26:108:542:506:11:Times:11:Times:A:The regression in column (1) of table 4 includes only independent variables that are known at the 
18:427:40283:26:25:72:543:480:11:Times:11:Times:B:time  the  IPO  is  filed,  as  well  as  VOL.    We  find  that  IPO  firm  assets,  exchange  listing,  the  technology 
18:428:40405:25:25:72:542:455:11:Times:11:Times:B:dummy,  and  volatility  have  significant  power  to  explain  the  cross-sectional  differences  in  the  initial 
18:429:40521:25:26:72:542:430:11:Times:11:Times:B:return.    Specifically,  IPO  firms  that  are  larger,  list  on  AMEX,  are  not  technology  firms,  and  have  less 
18:430:40642:26:25:72:543:404:11:Times:11:Times:B:volatile returns after the offering have the least underpricing.  Column (3) shows the same regression, but 
18:431:40750:25:26:72:420:379:11:Times:11:Times:B:only includes those independent variables with significant explanatory power.  
18:432:40828:26:26:108:542:353:11:Times:11:Times:A:Column  (5)  adds  two  measures  of  price  update;    ∆P  and ∆P+,  to  allow  for  asymmetry.    We  find 
18:433:40937:26:26:72:543:327:11:Times:11:Times:B:that the effect of the price update on initial returns is in fact asymmetric.  A 10% increase in the IPO price 
18:434:41048:26:25:72:542:301:11:Times:11:Times:B:from the mid-point of the initial filing range predicts a 8.94% (0.207 + 0.687) higher initial return, while a 
18:435:41159:25:25:72:543:276:11:Times:11:Times:B:10%  decrease  in  the  IPO  price  predicts  a  2.07%  lower  initial  return.    Thus,  the  initial  return  responds 
18:436:41280:25:25:72:543:251:11:Times:11:Times:B:more  to  positive  price  updates  than  to  negative  price  updates.    Investment  bankers  and  issuing  firms 
18:437:41396:25:26:72:542:226:11:Times:11:Times:B:incorporate  negative  information  more  fully  into  the  offer  price  than  positive  information.    This  is 
18:438:41511:26:25:72:543:200:11:Times:11:Times:B:consistent with underwriters trying to avoid losses on overpriced issues while allowing informed investors 
18:439:41618:25:28:72:543:175:11:Times:11:Times:B:to share the gains on underpriced issues.  Consistent with Hanley (1993), when we omit the variable that 
18:440:41723:28:30:72:542:147:11:Times:11:Times:B:measures  the  asymmetric  effect  of  price  updates, ∆P+i,  we  obtain  a  significantly  positive  coefficient  on 
18:441:41841:30:0:72:301:117:11:Symbol:11:Times:B:∆Pi   (coefficient of 0.450 and a t-statistic of 20.70). 
19:442:41933:0:26:108:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:A:As  discussed  earlier,  Benveniste  and  Spindt’s  model  says  that  underwriters  have  an  incentive  to 
19:443:42042:26:25:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:only  partially  incorporate private  information  learned  during  the  filing  or  book-building  period  into  the 
19:444:42160:25:25:72:543:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:final offer price.  Also, Rock (1986) and Beatty and Ritter (1986), among others, posit that issues that are 
19:445:42269:25:26:72:543:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:subject  to  greater  information  asymmetry,  such  as  issues  by  small  firms  and  issues  with  lower-ranked 
19:446:42384:26:25:72:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:underwriters, will tend to be more underpriced.  However, neither theory suggests that public information 
19:447:42490:25:25:72:524:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:about market conditions during the registration period should be predictably related to initial returns.   
19:448:42596:25:26:108:543:558:11:Times:11:Times:A:Column (7) of table 4 contains estimates of eq. (1) that include the stock market return during the 
19:449:42696:26:26:72:543:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration  period,  MKT  (and  MKT+  to  measure  asymmetric  effects  of  MKT,  if  any).    Given  the  price 
19:450:42811:26:26:72:542:506:11:Times:11:Times:B:update, ∆P,  and  the  firm  and  deal  characteristics  that  are  known  at  the  time  of  the  IPO,  there  is  no 
19:451:42930:26:25:72:542:480:11:Times:11:Times:B:incremental effect of MKT and MKT+ on initial returns (t-statistics of 1.28 and –0.83).  This is consistent 
19:452:43038:25:25:72:542:455:11:Times:11:Times:B:with the IPO price reflecting the public information about market conditions that became available during 
19:453:43144:25:32:72:181:430:11:Times:11:Times:B:the registration period.6  
19:454:43169:32:31:72:179:398:11:Times:11:Times:B:5.4  Sensitivity Analysis 
19:455:43194:31:25:72:543:367:10:Times:11:Times:B: We  conducted  a  variety  of  sensitivity  analyses  to  check  the  robustness  of  our  results.    First,  we 
19:456:43308:25:26:72:542:342:11:Times:11:Times:B:added return on assets to the initial return regressions to see whether prior operating performance affects 
19:457:43416:26:25:72:543:316:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO pricing, but this was not significant and other results were essentially unchanged.  Second, we used a 
19:458:43523:25:25:72:542:291:11:Times:11:Times:B:variety  of  different  return  measures  to  capture  the  effects  of  public  information  learned  during  the 
19:459:43638:25:25:72:542:266:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration  period.    For  example,  we  estimated  the  regressions  using  CRSP  value-weighted  (instead  of 
19:460:43753:25:26:72:542:241:11:Times:11:Times:B:equal-weighted)  returns.    In  addition,  we  created  three  different  portfolios  of  firms  from  our  sample  of 
19:461:43873:26:25:72:542:215:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPOs  that  had  come  public  within  the  last year,  and  calculated  the  returns  to  these  portfolios.    The  first 
19:462:43997:25:25:72:543:190:11:Times:11:Times:B:portfolio contained all of the firms available in the SDC sample.  To incorporate the possibility that public 
19:463:44107:25:45:72:543:165:11:Times:11:Times:B:information differs across industries, the second portfolio included the subset of firms that were coded as 
19:464:44215:45:7:72:219:120:10:Times:10:Times:F:                                                           
19:465:44273:7:16:72:542:113:6:Times:10:Times:F:6  However, Lowry and Schwert (2000) show that the relation between the price update and market returns during 
19:466:44382:16:11:71:542:97:10:Times:10:Times:F:the  registration  period  is  highly  asymmetric,  with  substantial  adjustments  of  the  IPO  price  to  decreases  in  market 
19:467:44513:11:12:72:543:86:10:Times:10:Times:F:prices,  but  only  modest  increases  in  IPO  prices  when  market  prices  increase.    This  puzzling  under  reaction  of  IPO 
19:468:44645:12:0:72:355:74:10:Times:10:Times:F:prices to market prices was first noted by Loughran and Ritter (1999). 
20:469:44751:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:technology firms by SDC, and the third contained the non-technology IPO stocks.  Results using all these 
20:470:44856:26:38:72:385:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:alternative measures of public information were qualitatively similar.   
20:471:44928:38:39:72:417:646:12:Times:12:Times:C:6. IPO Cycles Controlling for the Characteristics of Issuing Firms 
20:472:44993:39:25:108:543:607:11:Times:11:Times:A:In this section, we employ the results from table 4 to examine the sources of the serial correlation 
20:473:45094:25:25:72:546:582:11:Times:11:Times:B:in initial returns and of the positive relation between average initial returns and subsequent IPO volume.  
20:474:45202:25:26:72:542:557:11:Times:11:Times:B:First,  we  hope  to  shed  light  on  the  extent  to  which  companies  going public  following  periods  of  high 
20:475:45319:26:25:72:543:531:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns  can  themselves  expect  to  be  especially  underpriced.    The  last  section  showed  that  initial 
20:476:45440:25:25:72:542:506:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns are predictably related to firm-specific characteristics and to information that is learned during the 
20:477:45551:25:26:72:543:481:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration period.  Either of these factors could potentially induce serial correlation in the initial return 
20:478:45663:26:25:72:543:455:11:Times:11:Times:B:series, but neither implies that a company’s eventual underpricing will be predictably related to average 
20:479:45769:25:25:72:252:430:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns observed before the filing. 
20:480:45812:25:25:108:543:405:11:Times:11:Times:A:We also examine the source of the information in average initial returns that leads companies to 
20:481:45909:25:26:72:543:380:11:Times:11:Times:B:file IPOs.  The evidence in section 5 shows that initial returns are comprised of three parts:  information 
20:482:46017:26:25:72:543:354:11:Times:11:Times:B:related to firm-specific characteristics, information that becomes available during the registration period, 
20:483:46126:25:25:72:543:329:11:Times:11:Times:B:but  is  only  partially  incorporated  into  the  final  offer  price,  and  new  information  provided  by  the 
20:484:46240:25:26:72:542:304:11:Times:11:Times:B:secondary  market.    By  investigating  these  three  parts  of  the  pricing  process,  we  hope  to  learn  what 
20:485:46356:26:31:72:417:278:11:Times:11:Times:B:information companies find to be most relevant in their decisions to file IPOs. 
20:486:46435:31:31:72:241:247:11:Times:11:Times:B:6.1 Autocorrelations of Initial returns 
20:487:46474:31:25:108:543:216:11:Times:11:Times:A:The regressions in table 4 show that there are predictable relations between the characteristics of 
20:488:46574:25:26:72:542:191:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO firms and the initial return.  Thus, part of the autocorrelation in aggregate initial returns could be due 
20:489:46685:26:25:72:543:165:11:Times:11:Times:B:to cycles in the types of firms that choose to go public.  If so, the autocorrelation in initial returns in table 
20:490:46799:25:25:72:542:140:11:Times:11:Times:B:1  could  simply  reflect  patterns in  the  types  of  firms  going  public.    Table  4  also  showed  that  the  initial 
20:491:46923:25:0:72:543:115:11:Times:11:Times:B:return was related to information learned during the registration period.  Because the registration period 
21:492:47066:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:averages  two  months,  IPOs  that  are  close  to  one  another  in  calendar  time  will  tend  to  have  overlapping 
21:493:47186:26:25:72:464:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:registration periods.  This could also contribute to the serial correlation of initial returns. 
21:494:47281:25:25:108:540:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:We test these ideas by aggregating the predictions of initial returns that are implied by the cross-
21:495:47381:25:26:72:542:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:sectional  regression  models  in  table  4  into  expected  components  and  the  residuals  into  unexpected 
21:496:47492:26:25:72:543:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:components, where both are weighted by proceeds raised in the IPO.  Table 5 shows the mean, median, 
21:497:47592:25:25:72:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:standard  deviation,  minimum,  maximum,  and  12  autocorrelations  of  the  initial  return,  and  its  expected 
21:498:47707:25:26:72:265:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:and unexpected components from 1985-97. 
21:499:47746:26:25:107:542:532:11:Times:11:Times:A:We  use  the  predictions  from  column  (3)  in  table  4  to  represent  the  expected  initial  returns 
21:500:47853:25:25:71:542:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:(EF(IR)) for firms having IPOs in month t, conditional on information available at the time the IPO is filed 
21:501:47961:25:25:71:542:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:(information  in  the  preliminary  prospectus  plus  volatility  as  an  estimate  of  firm  risk).    The  unexpected 
21:502:48081:25:26:71:543:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  return,  [IR – EF(IR)],  is  the  proceeds-weighted  residual  or  forecast  error  from  the  same  table  4 
21:503:48200:26:25:71:542:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:regression  and  consists  of  information  learned  during  the  registration  period  plus  the  incremental 
21:504:48311:25:25:71:411:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:information provided by the secondary market when the firm starts trading.   
21:505:48387:25:26:107:542:381:11:Times:11:Times:A:Looking  at  row  2  of  table  5,  the  autocorrelations  of  expected  initial  returns  at  the  time  of  the 
21:506:48501:26:25:71:543:355:11:Times:11:Times:B:filing, EF(IR), start around 0.30 and decay slowly.  This indicates that at least part of the autocorrelation 
21:507:48611:25:25:71:542:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:in observed initial returns is attributable to the mix of firms going public.  In addition, the first lag of the 
21:508:48724:25:26:71:542:305:11:Times:11:Times:B:unexpected  initial  return  (row  3),  [IR – EF(IR)],  equals  0.33,  indicating  that  information  learned  during 
21:509:48842:26:25:72:543:279:11:Times:11:Times:B:the  registration  period  and/or  biases  in  underwriter  pricing  also  contribute  to  the  serial  correlation  in 
21:510:48962:25:25:72:136:254:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns. 
21:511:48978:25:25:108:543:229:11:Times:11:Times:A:To  determine  whether  there  do  in  fact  exist  biases  in  underwriter  pricing,  we  again  decompose 
21:512:49086:25:26:72:543:204:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns  into  expected  and  unexpected  components,  but  this  time  we  condition  on  all  information 
21:513:49203:26:25:72:542:178:11:Times:11:Times:B:available  at  the  time  of  the offer.    Specifically,  we  use  the  predictions  from  column  (5)  in  table  4  to 
21:514:49325:25:25:72:542:153:11:Times:11:Times:B:represent  the  initial  returns  conditional  on  all  information  in  the  preliminary  prospectus,  all  information 
21:515:49446:25:26:72:542:128:11:Times:11:Times:B:learned  during  the  registration  period,  and  also  volatility,  EO(IR).    The  corresponding  measure  of 
21:516:49558:26:25:72:542:102:11:Times:11:Times:B:unexpected  initial  returns,  [IR – EO(IR)],  consists  only  of  the  incremental  information  provided  by  the 
21:517:49674:25:0:72:543:77:11:Times:11:Times:B:secondary  market  when  the  firm  starts  trading.    Note  that  if  underwriters  take  into  account  all  available 
22:518:49832:0:26:72:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:information when they set the offer prices of these IPOs, then these unexpected initial returns should not 
22:519:49939:26:25:72:170:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:be serially correlated. 
22:520:49962:25:25:108:542:659:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  last  row  of  Table  5  shows  that  the  autocorrelations  of  this  measure  of  unexpected  initial 
22:521:50071:25:26:72:542:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:returns,  [IR – EO(IR)],  are  close  to  zero  at  all  lags.    This  suggests  that  the  cross-sectional  models  in 
22:522:50192:26:25:72:542:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:column (5) of table 4 capture all of the interesting dynamics in predicting initial returns.  The finding that 
22:523:50303:25:25:72:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:B:[IR – EO(IR)] is uncorrelated through time shows that all of the serial correlation in initial returns can be 
22:524:50413:25:26:72:545:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:explained  by  the  effects  of  firm  characteristics  and  information  learned  during  the  registration  period.  
22:525:50532:26:25:72:543:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:Evidently, firms and investment bankers take information about recent market conditions into account in 
22:526:50636:25:25:72:543:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:setting  the  expected  IPO  price  of  new  offers  being  filed.    The  level  of  recent  initial  returns  contains  no 
22:527:50761:25:25:72:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  about  the  expected  underpricing  of  new  IPOs  being  filed,  meaning  that  a  company  can 
22:528:50871:25:32:72:429:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:neither gain nor lose by filing during a period of high versus low initial returns.   
22:529:50956:32:31:72:279:425:11:Times:11:Times:B:6.2 The Information Content of Initial Returns 
22:530:51002:31:25:108:542:394:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  results  in  table  5  provide  strong  evidence  that  the  level  of  initial  returns  at  the  time  a  firm 
22:531:51120:25:26:72:543:369:11:Times:11:Times:B:files  to  go  public  contain  no  information  about  that  IPO’s  eventual  underpricing.    Thus,  firms  do  not 
22:532:51238:26:25:72:543:343:11:Times:11:Times:B:appear to be at a disadvantage if they file an IPO during a period of high initial returns.  We now consider 
22:533:51347:25:25:72:542:318:11:Times:11:Times:B:the factors that lead firms to prefer to file an IPO during such periods.  This section seeks to identify more 
22:534:51458:25:26:72:543:293:11:Times:11:Times:B:precisely  the  source  of  the  information  contained  in  initial  returns  that  leads  so  many  companies  to  go 
22:535:51578:26:25:72:281:267:11:Times:11:Times:B:public following periods of high underpricing.  
22:536:51625:25:25:108:542:242:11:Times:11:Times:A:Table 6 shows Granger F-tests from second order VAR models (similar to tables 2 and 3) relating 
22:537:51721:25:25:72:543:217:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns with past and future measures of both the number of IPOs filed per month (NFIL) and the 
22:538:51825:25:26:72:542:192:11:Times:11:Times:B:number  of  IPOs  offered  per  month  (NIPO).    It  also  shows  the  relations  between  the  expected  and 
22:539:51936:26:25:72:543:166:11:Times:11:Times:B:unexpected components of initial returns, conditional on various information sets, with these measures of 
22:540:52042:25:25:72:131:141:11:Times:11:Times:B:IPO volume. 
22:541:52053:25:26:108:543:116:11:Times:11:Times:A:We focus first on the relations between initial returns and subsequent IPO volume, in the hope of 
22:542:52151:26:0:72:542:90:11:Times:11:Times:B:understanding the sources of information that companies rely on as they decide when to go public.  The 
23:543:52290:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:first  column  shows  F-tests  for  the  VARs  between  actual  IR  and  the  subsequent  NFIL  and  NIPO.    As 
23:544:52403:26:25:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:previously shown in Tables 2 and 3, we find that both pricing measures are significantly positively related 
23:545:52511:25:25:72:543:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:to both measures of subsequent IPO volume.  The second and third columns employ the results from the 
23:546:52612:25:26:72:543:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:previous  section  to  decompose  the  initial  return  into  expected  and  unexpected  components,  based  on 
23:547:52724:26:25:72:454:608:11:Times:11:Times:B:various information sets, to determine more specifically the source of these relations.   
23:548:52813:25:25:108:542:583:11:Times:11:Times:A:In  rows  1  and  3  the  expected  initial  return  is  conditional  on  the  firm-specific  information 
23:549:52919:25:26:72:542:558:11:Times:11:Times:B:contained  in  the  preliminary  prospectus,  as  well  as  volatility.    Thus,  the  expected  initial  return  contains 
23:550:53042:26:25:72:543:532:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  about  the  types  of  companies  going  public,  while  the  unexpected  initial  return  incorporates 
23:551:53159:25:25:72:543:507:11:Times:11:Times:B:all of the information learned during the registration period plus the incremental information provided by 
23:552:53266:25:25:72:543:482:11:Times:11:Times:B:the secondary market.  Results show that the expected initial return has little power to predict either NFIL 
23:553:53375:25:26:72:542:457:11:Times:11:Times:B:or NIPO (p-values of 0.114 and 0.077), while the unexpected initial return is a highly significant predictor 
23:554:53484:26:25:72:542:431:11:Times:11:Times:B:of  both  (p-values  of  0.020  and  0.005).    This  suggests  that  the  relevant  information  must  be  related  to 
23:555:53604:25:25:72:543:406:11:Times:11:Times:B:either information learned during the registration period or to the incremental information provided by the 
23:556:53712:25:26:72:466:381:11:Times:11:Times:B:secondary market at the time of the offer, but not to the types of companies going public. 
23:557:53802:26:25:108:542:355:11:Times:11:Times:A:Rows  5  and  7  provide  support  for  the  importance  of  information  learned  during  the  registration 
23:558:53911:25:25:72:543:330:11:Times:11:Times:B:period.    Notably,  when  information  learned  during  the  registration  period  is  included  in  the  expected 
23:559:54027:25:26:72:542:305:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial return, the expected initial return is a significant predictor of future IPO volume (p-values of 0.011 
23:560:54138:26:25:72:540:279:11:Times:11:Times:B:and  0.005).    However,  the  unexpected  initial  return  is  not  significantly  related  to  future  IPO  volume  (p-
23:561:54259:25:25:72:543:254:11:Times:11:Times:B:values of 0.574 and 0.063), indicating that companies do not rely on the incremental information provided 
23:562:54365:25:25:72:363:229:11:Times:11:Times:B:by the secondary market in their decisions of when to go public.   
23:563:54431:25:26:108:543:204:11:Times:11:Times:A:The  results  in  rows  1,  3,  5,  and  7  indicate  that  private  companies  rely  heavily  on  information 
23:564:54542:26:25:72:543:178:11:Times:11:Times:B:learned during the registration periods of recent IPOs in their decisions of when to go public.  Neither the 
23:565:54651:25:25:72:543:153:11:Times:11:Times:B:types of firms that have recently gone public nor the incremental information provided by the secondary 
23:566:54755:25:26:72:390:128:11:Times:11:Times:B:market influences the filing or issuing decisions of other private firms.   
23:567:54830:26:25:108:542:102:11:Times:11:Times:A:Finally, table 6 also shows the relations between NFIL and NIPO and subsequent (as opposed to 
23:568:54924:25:0:72:543:77:11:Times:11:Times:B:past)  initial  returns.    Consistent  with  prior  evidence,  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  significant  relation 
24:569:55080:0:26:72:543:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:between IPO volume and future initial returns.  This lack of any significant evidence also extends to the 
24:570:55186:26:38:72:320:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:expected and unexpected components of initial returns.  
24:571:55241:38:25:72:168:646:12:Times:12:Times:C:7. Conclusion 
24:572:55253:25:25:108:543:621:11:Times:11:Times:A:Our  results  show  that  the  dynamic  behavior  of  initial  returns  and  IPO  issues  is  a  complicated 
24:573:55362:25:25:72:543:596:11:Times:11:Times:B:function  of  many  factors.    First,  there  are  significant  biases  in  the  expected  offer  prices  listed  in 
24:574:55480:25:26:72:542:571:11:Times:11:Times:B:preliminary  prospectuses,  in  the  sense  that  the  difference  between  the  expected  offer  price  and  the  final 
24:575:55601:26:25:72:542:545:11:Times:11:Times:B:offer  price  is  predictably  related  to  publicly  known  firm-  and  offer-specific  characteristics.    Further,  the 
24:576:55724:25:25:72:542:520:11:Times:11:Times:B:predictability of initial returns shows that underwriters only partially incorporate private information that 
24:577:55834:25:26:72:543:495:11:Times:11:Times:B:is  learned  during  the  registration  period  into  the  final  offer  price,  but  that  public  information  is  fully 
24:578:55957:26:25:72:133:469:11:Times:11:Times:B:incorporated. 
24:579:55970:25:25:108:542:444:11:Times:11:Times:A:Despite all of the evidence on the predictability of initial returns, we find that investment bankers 
24:580:56072:25:26:72:543:419:11:Times:11:Times:B:do fully incorporate current market conditions into the final offer price.  The average initial returns at the 
24:581:56183:26:25:72:543:393:11:Times:11:Times:B:time  a  company  files  an  IPO  contain  no  information  about  the  extent  to  which  that  company  will  be 
24:582:56298:25:25:72:542:368:11:Times:11:Times:B:underpriced.  Thus, there exists no evidence that companies can benefit by filing IPOs during periods of 
24:583:56403:25:25:72:248:343:11:Times:11:Times:B:low versus high average initial returns.  
24:584:56444:25:26:108:543:318:11:Times:11:Times:A:The positive relation between average initial returns and subsequent IPO volume suggests that the 
24:585:56542:26:25:72:542:292:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial returns of recent IPOs contain information on the market’s valuation of future IPOs.  Notably, it is 
24:586:56651:25:25:72:543:267:11:Times:11:Times:B:information  learned  during  the  registration  period  that  is  related  to  future  IPO  volume.    The  portions  of 
24:587:56773:25:26:72:542:242:11:Times:11:Times:B:initial  returns  that  reflect  firm  characteristics  and  information  provided  by  the  secondary  market  are  not 
24:588:56894:26:25:72:506:216:11:Times:11:Times:B:reliably related to either the number of subsequent filings or the number of subsequent offerings.   
24:589:56994:25:25:108:543:191:11:Times:11:Times:A:Thus, the apparent IPO cycles that have been studied previously reflect two factors.  First, similar 
24:590:57095:25:26:72:542:166:11:Times:11:Times:B:types of firms choose to go public at about the same time.  To the extent that this clustering is associated 
24:591:57204:26:25:72:546:140:11:Times:11:Times:B:with predictably different expected initial returns, there will be persistence in initial returns through time.  
24:592:57317:25:25:72:542:115:11:Times:11:Times:B:Second,  and  more  important,  the  information  about  the  value  of  an  IPO  firm  that  becomes  available 
24:593:57430:25:0:72:543:90:11:Times:11:Times:B:during the registration period has an effect on the prices and offering decisions for other firms.  Since the 
25:594:57576:0:26:72:542:710:11:Times:11:Times:B:book-building  period  averages  two  months,  but  often  lasts  as  long  as  four  months,  IPOs  in  subsequent 
25:595:57692:26:25:72:542:684:11:Times:11:Times:B:months  have  overlapping  registration  periods.    It  is  the  length  of  time  necessary  to  produce  the 
25:596:57804:25:25:72:543:659:11:Times:11:Times:B:information   reflected   in   the   initial   returns   that   causes   monthly   aggregate   initial   returns   to   be 
25:597:57927:25:0:72:399:634:11:Times:11:Times:B:autocorrelated and to be positively related to future levels of IPO activity.

33:973:69442:19:13:71:722:485:11:Times:11:Times:B:             Regression models for the returns to IPO investors in the U.S. using SDC data from 1985-97.  RANK is the underwriter rank, from Carter 
33:974:69590:13:12:72:722:472:11:Times:11:Times:B:and Manaster (1990) and Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998).  TA equals the logarithm of real total assets before IPO.  NYSE equals one if the IPO 
33:975:69732:12:13:72:723:460:11:Times:11:Times:B:firm  will  be  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  and  zero  otherwise.    NASDAQ  equals  one  if  the  IPO  firm  will  be  listed  on  the  Nasdaq 
33:976:69894:13:13:72:722:447:11:Times:11:Times:B:National  Market  System,  and  zero  otherwise.    AMEX  equals  one  if  the  IPO  firm  will  be  listed  on  the  American  Stock  Exchange,  and  zero 
33:977:70050:13:12:71:722:434:11:Times:11:Times:B:otherwise.    TECH  equals  one  if  the  firm  is  in  a  high  tech  industry  [biotech,  computer  equipment,  electronics,  communications,  &  general 
33:978:70206:12:13:71:722:422:11:Times:11:Times:B:technology  (as  defined  by  SDC)],  and  zero  otherwise.    VOL  is  the  market-adjusted  volatility  of  the  IPO  stock  return,  the  log  of  the  standard 
33:979:70370:13:13:72:722:409:11:Times:11:Times:B:deviation of daily returns to the IPO stock in the first 63 trading days after the IPO divided by the standard deviation of daily returns to the CRSP 
33:980:70520:13:14:72:722:396:11:Times:11:Times:B:equal-weighted market index of NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq-listed stocks during the same period.  ∆P is the percentage change between middle of 
33:981:70659:14:13:72:722:382:11:Times:11:Times:B:the  range  of  prices  in  the  initial  registration  statement  and  the  offer  price.    ∆P+  equals ∆P  when  it  is  positive,  and  zero  otherwise.    MKT  is  the 
33:982:70832:13:12:71:722:369:11:Times:11:Times:B:return to the CRSP equal-weighted portfolio for the period between the filing date and the offering date for the IPO.  MKT+ is the return to the 
33:983:70977:12:13:72:722:357:11:Times:11:Times:B:market MKT when it is positive, and zero otherwise.  The t-statistics  use White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.  R2 is the 
33:984:71125:13:13:72:681:344:11:Times:11:Times:B:coefficient of determination, adjusted for degrees of freedom.  S(u) is the standard error of the regression.  The sample size is 3,832 IPOs.
