2:37:2242:28:28:273:338:602:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:38:2250:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:We  study  how  privately  insured  individuals  choose  lower-limb  MRI  scan  providers.  Despite 
2:39:2350:14:14:72:543:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:significant out-of-pocket costs and little variation in quality, patients often received care in high-
2:40:2451:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:priced locations when lower priced options were available. The choice of provider is such that, on 
2:41:2549:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:average, patients bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their homes and treatment locations. 
2:42:2645:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:We show that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. The influence of 
2:43:2742:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:referring physicians is dramatically greater than the influence of patient cost-sharing or patients’ 
2:44:2842:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:home zip code fixed effects. Patients with vertically integrated referring physicians are also more 
2:45:2941:14:42:72:291:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:likely to receive costlier hospital-based scans.

3:71:3478:0:25:72:182:707:206:g_d0_f4:206:g_d0_f4:C:1  Introduction
3:72:3493:25:14:72:539:682:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:From 2000 to 2016, U.S. private health insurance premiums for family coverage increased 182 percent in
3:73:3595:14:15:72:541:668:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:real terms from $6,438 to $18,142 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2017). In an effort to slow premium growth,
3:74:3698:15:15:72:541:653:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:insurers have steadily increased beneficiaries’ cost sharing and deductibles (Schoen et al. 2011; Kaiser Family
3:75:3809:15:15:72:539:638:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Foundation 2015). Government policy encouraged these changes by establishing tax free health savings
3:76:3909:15:15:72:540:623:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:accounts (Bumiller 2016). The motivation underlying more demand side cost sharing is that increased cost
3:77:4013:15:15:72:540:608:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:exposure would both reduce moral hazard and encourage patients to become more active consumers of health
3:78:4117:15:15:72:540:593:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:care services – so-called shoppers (Baicker, Dow, and Wolfson 2006). As a result, at present in the United
3:79:4223:15:15:72:540:578:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:States (US), 46 percent of workers now have a deductible of $1,000 or more, one in four are enrolled in a
3:80:4328:15:15:72:540:563:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:plan with a deductible of at least $3,000, and average out-of-pocket costs in 2016 were $714 (Kaiser Family
3:81:4435:15:15:72:541:548:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Foundation 2017; JP Morgan Chase & Co. 2017). However, to date, the simple prediction from price theory –
3:82:4540:15:15:72:540:533:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:that increasing cost sharing and giving access to price transparency tools would induce patients to shop for
3:83:4648:15:15:72:542:518:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:care – has not been well supported by the empirical evidence on consumer behavior (Brot-Goldberg et al.
3:84:4751:15:15:71:539:503:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:2017; Desai et al. 2017; Mehrotra et al. 2017). This paper studies whether and why the reality of shopping
3:85:4857:15:15:72:346:488:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:for health care services lags behind what price theory predicts.
3:86:4921:15:15:86:539:473:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:A:Using data from a large commercial insurer, we study how individuals age 19 to 64 with private health
3:87:5022:15:15:72:540:458:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:insurance, high out-of-pocket cost exposure, and access to a price transparency tool consume lower-limb MRI
3:88:5129:15:15:72:540:443:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:scans. We focus, in particular, on the frequency that patients forgo receiving care at lower priced locations in
3:89:5241:15:15:72:539:428:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:lieu of receiving care at more expensive providers. Lower-limb MRI scans are among the least differentiated
3:90:5348:15:14:72:541:413:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:health care services, are relatively expensive, and can generally be scheduled in advance of care. They should,
3:91:5459:14:15:72:540:399:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:therefore, be one of the most easily shoppable health care services delivered to patients in the US. Our results
3:92:5571:15:15:72:540:384:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:show that patients do not shop for care effectively in this very simple clinical setting. We then take the
3:93:5677:15:15:72:540:369:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:next step of explaining why consumers behave as they do. We explore and describe the frictions that are
3:94:5780:15:15:72:542:354:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:preventing patients from accessing lower priced care and analyze the factors that are influencing patients’
3:95:5887:15:15:72:540:339:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:choices over where to receive treatment. We posit that given our evidence that patients struggle to shop
3:96:5991:15:15:72:540:324:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:effectively for lower-limb MRI scans, our evidence is suggestive that patients will also struggle to shop for
3:97:6100:15:15:72:223:309:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:more complex health care services.
3:98:6134:15:15:86:540:294:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:In other contexts, economists generally believe that utility-maximizing consumers are capable of effectively
3:99:6242:15:15:72:541:279:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:shopping for simple goods and services (Samuelson 1948). Even for more complex goods like automobiles,
3:100:6344:15:15:72:541:264:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:there is evidence that consumers can capably observe and consider tradeoffs between complex characteristics,
3:101:6452:15:15:72:539:249:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:like fuel efficiency, horsepower, and cabin luxury (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995). However, a literature
3:102:6560:15:15:72:539:234:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:has developed which questions the extent to which patients can effectively shop for health care services
3:103:6664:15:15:70:539:219:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:(see Arrow 1963; Volpp 2016; Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017). There are three factors that are often cited
3:104:6765:15:15:72:540:204:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:as impediments to individuals operating as effective health care consumers. The first is the presence of
3:105:6869:15:15:72:540:189:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:third-party insurance, which insulates individuals from the true prices of the services they consume. The
3:106:6974:15:15:72:540:174:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:second is that there remains very little accurate pricing information available for consumers to use to compare
3:107:7085:15:14:72:540:159:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:prices across providers (Mahomed et al. 2018). And lastly, quality in health care can be challenging to
3:108:7188:14:15:72:540:145:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:measure, especially for non-experts. As result, patients rely heavily on recommendations of the referring
3:109:7293:15:15:72:115:130:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:physician.
3:110:7303:15:15:86:540:115:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Within our data, the prices of lower-limb MRI providers vary extensively within region. For example,
3:111:7403:15:15:72:540:100:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the MRI provider in the 80th percentile in the typical hospital referral region (HRR) is 1.73 times more
3:112:7507:15:0:72:540:85:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:expensive than the MRI provider in the 20th percentile. Much of this variation is a function of the type of
4:113:7615:0:15:72:540:710:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:facility where patients receive their imaging study: the average hospital-based lower-limb MRI scan in our
4:114:7721:15:15:72:542:695:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:data had a price of $1,474.35, while non-hospital-based lower-limb MRIs were, on average, priced at $642.82.
4:115:7829:15:15:72:540:680:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Our analysis suggests that the clinical quality of MRI scans does not vary substantially across providers. A
4:116:7937:15:15:72:540:665:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:low quality scan would need to be repeated. However, of the 50,484 MRIs in our data, only 0.006 percent of
4:117:8043:15:15:72:540:650:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:scans (3 scans in total) were repeated within a 90-day window. We will return to the issue of the quality of
4:118:8151:15:15:72:230:635:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:reading the scans later in the paper.
4:119:8188:15:15:86:539:620:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Despite the variation in MRI scan prices across providers, patients often receive care in high-priced
4:120:8289:15:15:72:540:605:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:locations when lower priced options are available. Figure 1 is an example typical of the patterns we observe
4:121:8397:15:15:72:540:590:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:in our data. It shows the prices of MRI providers in a large urban HRR. Each column is a provider that
4:122:8499:15:15:72:540:575:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:delivered at least one lower-limb MRI in 2013. The dots (right vertical axis) show the number of cases treated
4:123:8609:15:15:72:540:560:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:at each provider. In this HRR, the provider in the 80th percentile of prices in the area is 2.2 times more
4:124:8715:15:15:72:540:545:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:expensive than the provider in the 20th percentile and the most expensive provider is 7.5 times as expensive
4:125:8823:15:15:72:540:530:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:as the lowest-cost provider. Notably, in this HRR, the highest priced provider has the highest volume of MRI
4:126:8931:15:15:72:540:515:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:scans. This result is present in HRRs across the county. When we analyze the entirety of our sample, ignoring
4:127:9040:15:15:72:540:500:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:capacity constraints and general equilibrium (GE) effects, we estimate that if patients went to the lowest
4:128:9146:15:15:72:540:485:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:priced provider within a 60-minute car drive from their homes, total MRI spending would be reduced by 55.12
4:129:9253:15:15:72:540:470:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:percent, with insurer contributions decreasing by 61.22 percent ($333.39), and patient out-of-pocket costs
4:130:9359:15:14:72:537:455:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:decreasing by 44.23 percent ($135.13). We refer to this counterfactual as the ‘maximum potential savings.’
4:131:9465:14:15:86:539:441:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:When we explore the choices consumers make, we do not find that the usual features assumed to drive
4:132:9564:15:15:72:540:426:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:demand, such as the distance to potential providers, explain a significant amount of the variation in the
4:133:9669:15:15:72:540:411:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:prices of the MRI scans that patients receive. Indeed, a significant portion of the maximum potential savings
4:134:9778:15:15:72:540:396:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:is available without patients having to travel farther for care. For example, total spending on lower-limb MRI
4:135:9888:15:15:72:540:381:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:scans would be reduced by 35.81 percent if patients accessed the lowest priced provider available within the
4:136:9996:15:15:72:541:366:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:same drive time as they already were travelling (26-minutes on average). This result occurs because patients,
4:137:10105:15:15:72:540:351:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:on average, bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their home and the location where they received their
4:138:10212:15:15:72:94:336:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:scan.
4:139:10217:15:15:86:539:321:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Previous research has posited that greater cost-sharing may be necessary to nudge consumers to shop
4:140:10316:15:15:72:540:306:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:more effectively for care (Lieber 2017). We do find that patients with higher out-of-pocket costs receive
4:141:10421:15:15:72:541:291:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:lower priced MRI scans. This is consistent with evidence that, when faced with substantial price exposure,
4:142:10527:15:15:72:541:276:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:a modest number of patients (fewer than 10 percent) will change their provider choice (Robinson, Whaley,
4:143:10631:15:15:72:540:261:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:and Brown 2016; Frank et al. 2015). However, despite significant cost-sharing, patients’ out-of-pocket cost
4:144:10738:15:15:72:540:246:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:exposure only explains 2.4 percent of variance (4.2 percent of total explained variance) in the price of the
4:145:10846:15:15:72:234:231:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:locations where patients receive care.
4:146:10884:15:15:86:539:216:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Ultimately, we find that the factor that appears to limit patients’ ability to price shop is a factor
4:147:10985:15:15:72:541:201:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:underdiscussed in the price transparency literature. In our analysis of variation in patients’ MRI prices,
4:148:11091:15:14:71:541:186:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:we find that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. Looking across the nation,
4:149:11198:14:15:72:539:172:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:referring physician fixed effects explain 51 percent of the variance (92.1 percent of explained variance) in the
4:150:11310:15:15:72:539:157:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:price of MRI scans that patients receive. Indeed, referrer fixed effects explain a significantly larger share of
4:151:11422:15:15:72:448:142:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:the variance in the price of patients’ MRIs than patient zip code (ZCTA) fixed effects.
4:152:11509:15:15:86:539:127:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Further, we offer some of the first evidence on the behavior of referring physicians. We find that orthopedic
4:153:11618:15:15:72:540:112:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:surgeons tend to send their patients to a narrow group of imaging locations: the median referring orthopedic
4:154:11726:15:15:72:541:97:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:surgeon in our sample sends, on average, 79 percent of all her referrals to a single imaging provider. Likewise,
4:155:11838:15:0:72:540:82:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:the median referring orthopedic surgeon sends zero patients to the lowest cost provider within either 30- or
5:156:11947:0:15:72:540:710:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:60-minutes from the patient’s home. As a result, a crucial finding from our analysis is that in order to lower
5:157:12057:15:15:72:540:695:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:out-of-pocket costs and reduce total MRI spending, patients must diverge from their physicians’ established
5:158:12164:15:15:72:539:680:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:referral pathways or insurers must somehow persuade physicians to refer patients to different locations. This
5:159:12273:15:15:72:539:665:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:pattern points to a role for insurers to educate or incentivize physicians to refer in a more cost-effective
5:160:12381:15:15:72:298:650:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:manner and generate price elasticity for MRI scans.
5:161:12432:15:15:86:539:635:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:Decades of literature focusing on health care and other sectors has explored the agency relationship and
5:162:12536:15:15:72:540:620:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:found that agency is often imperfect (Hubbard 1998; Levitt and Syverson 2008). The referral decisions of
5:163:12640:15:15:72:540:605:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:physicians may be suboptimal for two reasons. First, referring physicians may lack information on the prices
5:164:12748:15:15:72:540:590:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:of the facilities where they are sending their patients, and second, physicians may be motivated to refer
5:165:12853:15:15:72:540:575:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:patients to specific providers for reasons other than quality or patient costs. Existing evidence suggests that
5:166:12964:15:15:72:541:560:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:physicians who are vertically-integrated with a hospital are more likely to refer patients to a hospital (Baker,
5:167:13076:15:15:72:540:545:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:Bundorf, and Kessler 2016). Consistent with this evidence, we find when a patient is referred by a vertically
5:168:13185:15:15:72:540:530:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:integrated referring physician, the price of their scan is 36.5 percent higher, they pay 31.9 percent higher
5:169:13293:15:15:72:459:515:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:out-of-pocket costs, and they are 27 percent more likely to receive a hospital-based scan.
5:170:13383:15:15:86:539:500:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Ultimately, our results have implications for the academic literature and for policy-makers. Existing models
5:171:13491:15:15:72:541:485:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:of patient choice use distance as the primary determinant of where patients receive care (Gowrisankaran,
5:172:13595:15:15:72:541:470:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Nevo, and Town 2015; Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite 2003; Ho 2006). These results suggest that,
5:173:13693:15:14:72:539:455:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:particularly for planned care, economists should integrate the effect of physician agency into their choice
5:174:13800:14:15:72:540:441:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:models. Our results also suggest a mechanism behind findings in the literature showing that introducing
5:175:13903:15:15:72:540:426:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:deductibles lowered health spending by over 11 percent without inducing individuals to more actively price
5:176:14009:15:15:72:540:411:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:shop (Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017). While deductibles may reduce the probability of individuals accessing
5:177:14112:15:15:72:540:396:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:health care services, our results suggest that once patients touch the health system, where they receive
5:178:14216:15:15:72:346:381:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:ensuing care is strongly influenced by their referring physician.
5:179:14281:15:15:86:539:366:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:On the policy front, our work highlights the limits of existing demand side cost sharing as a tool to
5:180:14382:15:15:72:540:351:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:improve patient shopping. Despite attractive predictions from price theory, these standard incentives do not
5:181:14490:15:15:72:540:336:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:perform well on real consumers in health care markets. Going forward, our work suggests that health care
5:182:14594:15:15:72:540:321:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:funders could more effectively steer patients towards high productivity providers by equipping physicians with
5:183:14704:15:15:72:540:306:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:information on the prices of potential locations for care and incentivizing them to make more cost-efficient
5:184:14812:15:15:72:540:291:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:referrals. These results are consistent with Ho and Pakes (2014), which find that insurers with more direct
5:185:14919:15:15:72:540:276:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:control over physician referrals are able to get lower priced secondary care and research on payment reform
5:186:15026:15:15:72:540:261:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:that suggests that when physicians are incented to make referrals to lower priced locations, they do so (Song
5:187:15135:15:15:72:209:246:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:et al. 2014; Carroll et al. 2018).
5:188:15169:15:15:86:539:231:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe our data and empirical approach. We

5:192:15587:14:15:72:540:172:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:in our data, identify patients’ referring physicians, construct price measures, and identify what patients and

6:197:15892:21:15:72:540:632:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Our primary data set is composed of insurance claims provided by a large national insurer that covers tens of
6:198:16001:15:15:72:540:617:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:millions of lives annually and is active in all 50 US states. Our main analysis uses data from 2013. We build
6:199:16110:15:15:72:540:602:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:an analytic sample of claims for the most common MRI scan in our data: lower extremity MRIs. Our goal is
6:200:16214:15:15:72:540:587:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:to identify shoppable, homogenous MRI scans (e.g. those that were not part of an emergency episode or that
6:201:16320:15:15:72:540:572:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:occurred during an inpatient stay). In Appendix B1, we describe how we identify lower-limb MRI scans and
6:202:16424:15:15:72:540:557:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the sample restrictions we put in place so that the MRIs in our sample were ones where consumers could
6:203:16526:15:15:72:505:542:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:actively make decisions. Appendix B1 also illustrates how each restriction impacts our sample size.
6:204:16625:15:14:86:539:527:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:A:As we describe in Appendix B2, we are also able to identify the physicians’ who ordered patients’ MRI
6:205:16726:14:15:72:540:513:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:scans. This allows us to link the referring physician ID to data from SK&A and infer whether referring
6:206:16828:15:15:72:540:498:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:physicians are part of vertically integrated organizations. The SK&A physician-level dataset identifies the
6:207:16935:15:15:72:540:483:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:group or hospital that owns a practice at which a given physician is employed. For our purposes, a physician is
6:208:17046:15:15:72:540:468:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:said to be in a “vertically integrated” practice if her practice is owned by a hospital. In the case of physicians
6:209:17160:15:15:72:540:453:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:practicing in multiple locations, we regard those physicians as being vertically integrated if any of the practices
6:210:17275:15:15:72:240:438:99:g_d0_f5:49:g_d0_f8:B:in which they work is hospital-owned.1
6:211:17313:15:15:86:539:423:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Our data contributor provides all their policy-holders with free access to a tool to search for providers and
6:212:17422:15:15:72:540:408:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:sort providers by distance and price. The tool links to claims data, so beneficiaries can observe their potential
6:213:17535:15:15:72:540:393:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:out-of-pocket payments at each location as a function of their plan design and year-to-date spending. We
6:214:17639:15:15:72:540:378:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:merge data on the use of this tool into our analysis. The transparency tool data includes a patient ID (which
6:215:17748:15:15:71:539:363:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:we use to link to the claims data), the date of the search, and information on what type of procedure the
6:216:17853:15:15:72:540:348:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:patient searched for. As a result, we can identify users who searched for MRI prices prior to receiving an
6:217:17959:15:15:72:117:333:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:MRI scan.

6:219:18069:15:15:72:540:303:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:co-payments, and payments under their deductibles. Our data also include the prices our data our data
6:220:18170:15:15:72:540:288:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:contributor has negotiated with facilities and physicians for the taking and reading of MRIs. More specific
6:221:18277:15:37:72:503:273:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:information on how we construct price measures for lower-limb MRIs is described in Appendix B3.
6:222:18372:37:22:72:211:236:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:?:2.2  Inferring MRI Quality
6:223:18398:22:15:71:540:214:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:We assume that the taking and reading of MRIs is undifferentiated across providers. While the actual taking
6:224:18505:15:15:72:539:199:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:of the MRI scan is undifferentiated, there is evidence of differentiation in the reading of MRI scans across
6:225:18613:15:15:72:540:184:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:radiologists. For example, Briggs et al. (2008) found that in 13 percent of neurological MRI scans, there was
6:226:18722:15:15:72:541:169:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:a major difference in diagnosis when a specialist radiologist reviewed the findings of a general radiologist.
6:227:18831:15:15:72:540:154:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:However, most evidence on diagnostic radiology errors have been observed in the documentation of cancers
6:228:18935:15:14:70:541:139:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:(Brady 2017). We focus on analysis of lower-limb MRI scans following a referral by an orthopedic surgeon.
6:229:19040:14:15:71:541:125:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:As a result, radiologists in our sample are generally looking for structural anomalies (e.g. torn ligaments),
6:230:19149:15:15:72:540:110:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:not subtle evidence of a cancer. Moreover, 84 percent of patients in our sample had follow-up visits with

6:233:19501:10:0:72:282:73:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:that those physicians’ practices are vertically integrated.
7:234:19561:0:15:72:540:710:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:orthopedic surgeons in the six months after the taking of their MRI. Orthopedists tend to review MRI
7:235:19661:15:15:72:540:695:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:results themselves before they initiate surgery, and Kim et al. (2008) and Figueiredo et al. (2018) found no
7:236:19769:15:15:72:540:680:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:difference in the diagnoses made when scans were read by orthopedists versus radiologists. Recall that we
7:237:19874:15:15:72:540:665:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:limit our sample to patients who see an orthopedist within 3 months of their scan and whose scan is ordered
7:238:19981:15:15:72:540:650:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:by an orthopedist. Thus, the sample of patients we analyze will experience the “reading quality” of their
7:239:20086:15:15:72:540:635:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:orthopedist, not the facility where the scan is done. Therefore, we assume that the MRI scan service we
7:240:20189:15:38:72:389:620:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:study is undifferentiated with respect to clinical quality across providers.

7:242:20349:21:15:72:540:561:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:For each patient who underwent an MRI in our sample, we construct a choice set of MRI providers within

7:244:20539:15:15:72:540:531:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:described in Appendix B4. By using drive time instead of straight-line distance, we allow patients in rural
7:245:20646:15:15:72:474:516:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:areas to travel farther in the same amount of time than patients in densely populated cities.
7:246:20739:15:15:86:539:501:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:The price of an MRI at each provider is calculated as the average of the prices of scans at that provider
7:247:20844:15:15:72:540:486:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:during our time period. The price we calculate includes the payments for the taking and reading of an MRI
7:248:20949:15:15:72:540:471:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:scan. Our combined price is the allowed amount captures the patient and insurer contributions to total
7:249:21051:15:15:72:540:456:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:payment for a scan. We then estimate what patients and our data contributor would pay for a lower-limb MRI
7:250:21157:15:15:72:541:441:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:scan at alternate, lower-priced providers. While we do not directly observe beneficiaries’ plan characteristics,
7:251:21269:15:15:71:539:426:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:we can infer plan benefit designs from our data (see Appendix B4 for a detailed discussion of our strategy for
7:252:21379:15:15:72:235:411:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:identifying counterfactual payments).
7:253:21416:15:15:86:538:396:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:For every case in our data, we identify the lowest priced alternative provider within a 60-minute drive
7:254:21519:15:15:72:540:381:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:from the patient’s home zip code. This is a mechanical calculation that ignores capacity constraints and GE
7:255:21626:15:15:72:540:366:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:effects. We then calculate the “money left on the table” by patients and insurers. The “money left on the
7:256:21731:15:15:72:540:351:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:table” is the amount of money the patient and the insurer would have saved respectively had the patient
7:257:21834:15:32:72:298:336:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:received an MRI scan at this lowest-priced location.

7:260:21923:22:15:71:539:246:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:The mean total price of MRI scans in our data (i.e. sum of allowed amounts on both physician and facilities
7:261:22030:15:15:72:540:231:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:claims) is $850.07 (Panel A of Table 1). Twenty-five percent of MRIs in our sample were performed in
7:262:22130:15:15:72:540:216:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:hospitals. Hospital-based MRIs have an average price of $1,474.35; non-hospital-based scans have an average
7:263:22237:15:15:72:143:201:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:price of $642.82.
7:264:22254:15:14:86:541:186:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:Patients in our data contribute $305.53, on average, to the cost of MRIs, while the insurer pays $544.54.
7:265:22359:14:15:71:539:172:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:22 percent of patients in our data paid for the entirety of their MRI, 54 percent had non-zero cost-sharing
7:266:22466:15:15:72:540:157:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:but did not bear the full cost of their scan, and 24 percent had zero out-of-pocket costs. Of those individuals
7:267:22577:15:15:71:539:142:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:who had cost sharing, 31 percent had health care costs over $5,000 in the three months after the taking of
7:268:22683:15:15:72:540:127:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:the scan, 38 percent had health care costs over $5,000 in the six months after the taking of the scan, and 19
7:269:22792:15:15:72:461:112:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:percent had health care costs over $10,000 in the six months after the taking of the scan.
7:270:22882:15:15:86:539:97:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:As we illustrate in Panel A of Table 1, the median patient in our sample attends a provider that is
7:271:22981:15:0:72:540:82:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:approximately a 22-minute car ride from her home. We also find that the median patient had 16 MRI
8:272:23079:0:15:72:540:710:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:locations within 30-minutes of her home. In 20 percent of cases, the patient received an MRI on the same
8:273:23183:15:38:72:193:695:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:day she saw an orthopedist.

8:275:23252:22:15:71:540:635:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:There is significant variation in the price of MRI providers within HRRs. As we illustrate in Appendix
8:276:23354:15:15:71:539:620:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Table A.1, the median HRR has 10 providers who delivered at least one scan to our sample population in
8:277:23456:15:14:71:539:605:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:2013. Across the 302 HRRs in our sample, the median ratio between the 80th and 20th percentile provider
8:278:23559:14:15:72:541:591:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:prices is 1.73. In 89 percent of HRRs, the highest-priced provider within the HRR is a hospital. Notably,
8:279:23664:15:15:72:540:576:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:despite the fact that hospital-based MRIs tend to be approximately 2.3 times as expensive as MRIs performed
8:280:23771:15:38:72:474:561:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:outside of a hospital, in 25 percent of HRRs, the highest volume MRI provider is a hospital.
8:281:23863:38:22:72:239:523:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:?:3.3  Maximum Potential Savings
8:282:23893:22:15:71:539:501:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:We calculate how much a patient and her insurer could save if she received an MRI scan from the lowest
8:283:23995:15:14:72:540:486:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:priced provider within a 60-minute drive from her home instead of where she currently received care. While
8:284:24101:14:15:72:540:472:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:these estimates ignore GE effects and capacity constraints, they give a sense of the potential savings available
8:285:24213:15:15:72:524:457:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:if patients attended lower cost providers. We refer to these savings as the ‘maximum potential savings.’
8:286:24317:15:15:86:539:442:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:The maximum potential savings for patients and insurers that we observe are substantial (Panel A of
8:287:24416:15:15:71:540:427:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Table 2). As we illustrate, if patients attended the lowest priced provider within an hour drive from their
8:288:24523:15:15:72:542:412:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:homes, there would be a mean savings per case of $468.53 and a reduction in MRI spending of 55.12 percent.
8:289:24629:15:15:72:540:397:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Under this counterfactual, patient out-of-pocket costs for the MRI would decrease, on average, by 44.23
8:290:24732:15:15:72:540:382:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:percent from $305.53 to $170.40. Likewise, insurers would lower their average spending on each lower-limb
8:291:24837:15:38:72:280:367:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:MRI by 61.22 percent, from $544.54 to $211.15.
8:292:24883:38:21:72:477:329:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:?:3.4  Association of MRI Prices with Quality, Distance, and Out-of-Pocket Costs
8:293:24961:21:15:71:540:308:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:When economists write down choice models, the attributes of health care providers that patients are assumed
8:294:25068:15:15:72:540:293:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:to value typically include quality, distance from home, and price. We examine, in turn, the extent to which
8:295:25175:15:15:72:326:278:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:each of these factors may explain the patterns we observe.
8:296:25233:15:15:86:539:263:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:A:Quality does not appear to vary across MRI providers. We assume that the reading of the MRI scan is
8:297:25332:15:15:72:540:248:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:done by the orthopedic surgeon who ordered the imaging study. The remaining measure of clinical quality is
8:298:25438:15:15:72:540:233:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:therefore whether MRI scan is correctly taken or needs to be repeated. However, as we illustrate in Appendix
8:299:25546:15:15:71:461:218:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Table A.2, of the 50,484 MRI scans in our data, only three were repeated within 90 days.
8:300:25634:15:15:86:539:203:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:A:Likewise, we find that patients can access lower-priced providers and obtain significant savings without
8:301:25738:15:15:72:540:188:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:travelling farther than they already went for care. In Panel B of Table 2, we test the share of the maximum
8:302:25845:15:15:72:541:173:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:potential savings that would be available if patients travelled no farther than they already went for care,
8:303:25952:15:15:71:540:158:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:15-minutes minutes farther, 30-minutes farther, and 45-minutes farther. As we illustrate, if patients attended
8:304:26062:15:15:72:542:143:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the lowest price provider reachable in the same time they traveled to reach their original providers, out-
8:305:26168:15:15:72:540:128:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:of-pocket costs could be reduced by 27 percent, insurance spending could be reduced by 41 percent, and
8:306:26270:15:15:72:540:113:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:total spending on lower-limb MRIs could be reduced by 36 percent. As a result, 65 percent of the maximum
8:307:26374:15:14:72:540:98:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:potential savings outlined in Panel B of Table 2 is available without forcing patients to travel farther than
8:308:26483:14:0:72:540:84:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:they already were travelling for care. Savings of this magnitude are possible without forcing patients to travel
9:309:26596:0:15:72:540:710:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:farther for care because, on average, patients travelled past six lower priced MRI providers between their
9:310:26702:15:15:72:283:695:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:home and the where they received an MRI scan.
9:311:26747:15:15:86:539:680:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:In Appendix Table A.3, we observe, in our conditional correlates, that individuals with higher out-of-pocket
9:312:26855:15:15:72:540:665:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:costs receive cheaper lower-limb MRI scans. For example, we observe that relative to individuals who bore
9:313:26960:15:15:72:540:650:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the full cost of their scan in out-of-pocket costs, individuals with zero price exposure had MRIs that were
9:314:27067:15:15:72:540:635:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:$101 more expensive, left $97 more dollars on the table, and were three percentage points more likely to
9:315:27171:15:15:72:540:620:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:receive a hospital-based scan. However, because of the structure of insurance plans, individuals may have spot
9:316:27281:15:15:72:539:605:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:prices (i.e. the price they pay when they access care) that differ markedly from their shadow prices (i.e. the
9:317:27391:15:15:72:540:590:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:expected true price given that some individuals will exceed their out-of-pocket maximum). Previous research
9:318:27498:15:15:72:540:575:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:has found that when faced with these non-linear contracts (e.g. commercial health insurance plans with high
9:319:27605:15:15:72:540:560:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:up front cost-sharing and out-of-pocket maximums), individuals tend to respond to the spot price, not the
9:320:27710:15:15:72:540:545:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:shadow price (Einav, Finkelstein, and Schrimpf 2015; Dalton, Gowrisankaran, and Town 2015; Brot-Goldberg
9:321:27814:15:15:72:124:530:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:et al. 2017).
9:322:27827:15:15:86:540:515:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Consistent with previous findings, individuals in our sample do not appear to effectively differentiate
9:323:27930:15:15:72:541:500:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:between spot and shadow prices. While we are unable to identify when individuals are over their deductible,
9:324:28037:15:15:71:539:485:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:we can observe individuals’ health spending in the three, six, and 12 months after the taking of their MRI
9:325:28143:15:15:72:540:470:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:scan. In Appendix Table A.4, we further subdivide those patients some cost with some or total cost exposure
9:326:28250:15:14:72:542:455:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:into those who have health care costs above and below $5,000 in the six months after they received care.

9:328:28441:15:15:72:539:426:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:For many individuals, health care costs over $5,000 in the six months after a scan would mean they faced a

9:331:28755:15:15:72:540:381:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:price that matches their shadow price) and those who likely bore the full cost of their MRI but had high
9:332:28859:15:15:72:540:366:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:future spending (e.g. those who had a shadow price that is considerably lower than their spot price), we find
9:333:28968:15:15:72:539:351:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:that there is no statistically significant difference between the prices of their MRIs. This result is robust when
9:334:29082:15:15:71:539:336:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:we split those with cost sharing into groups with other levels of spending and shorter and longer windows in
9:335:29190:15:38:71:344:321:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:which we measure spending (see Appendix Tables A.5 to A.8).

9:337:29285:21:15:72:540:262:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Of note, as we illustrate in Appendix Table A.9, very few individuals searched for the price of an MRI
9:338:29387:15:15:72:540:247:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:scan before receiving a scan. Of the 50,484 lower-limb MRI scans in our sample, patients used the price
9:339:29490:15:15:72:540:232:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:transparency tool supplied by the insurer to search for the price of MRI providers prior to receiving care in
9:340:29599:15:15:72:541:217:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:only 374 of cases (0.74 percent). This result is consistent with previous analysis from Desai et al. (2017),
9:341:29707:15:38:71:533:202:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:which also found that few privately insured individuals use price transparency tools before accessing care.

9:343:29853:21:15:71:538:143:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:To better understand the factors that explain the variance in lower-limb MRI scan prices, total amount of
9:344:29958:15:15:72:540:128:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:money left on the table, and whether an MRI scan is performed in a hospital, we perform an ANOVA and
9:345:30058:15:15:72:542:113:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:include controls for patients’ out-of-pocket price exposure, patient demographic characteristics (year of birth,
9:346:30170:15:13:83:539:98:36:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f10:F:2We use this strategy because we cannot observe when individuals’ deductibles reset each year and the reset dates differ

10:349:30429:15:15:72:159:695:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:referring physicians.
10:350:30450:15:15:86:539:680:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Our results indicate that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. As we illustrate
10:351:30560:15:15:72:539:665:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:in Table 3, referrer fixed-effects explain the largest share of the variance in the price of MRIs, money left on
10:352:30672:15:15:72:540:650:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the table, and whether or not a patient received a hospital-based MRI scan. Indeed, referrer fixed effects
10:353:30778:15:15:72:540:635:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:explain 51.47, 50.38, and 54.39 percent of the variance in each variable, respectively. As we illustrate in
10:354:30885:15:15:71:539:620:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Appendix Table A.10, this result remains robust when we substitute fixed effects for the zip code where the
10:355:30992:15:15:72:540:605:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:patient lives for fixed effects for the HRR where the patient lives. These results are also robust to excluding
10:356:31103:15:15:72:542:590:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the 20 percent of MRI cases that were delivered on the same day a patient saw an orthopedic surgeon.
10:357:31203:15:15:72:540:575:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Likewise, in Appendix Table A.11, we carry out a similar decomposition using an alternative approach, where
10:358:31310:15:15:71:539:560:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:we use the price of a patient’s MRI as the dependent variable, and identify the R2 statistic for a series of
10:359:31418:15:15:72:541:545:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:regressions including various combinations of covariates (e.g. zip code fixed effects, patient characteristics,
10:360:31529:15:15:72:540:530:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:referrer fixed effects) in each regression. Our results using this alternative approach remain qualitatively
10:361:31637:15:38:72:121:515:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:unchanged.

10:363:31709:21:15:72:540:456:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Orthopedists tend to refer their patients to a narrow group of MRI providers. In our data, the average
10:364:31811:15:15:72:540:441:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:referring orthopedic surgeon made 10 referrals for lower-limb MRIs in 2013 (Panel B of Table 1). The median
10:365:31918:15:15:72:540:426:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:orthopedic surgeon sent patients to 2.5 locations and the median referring physician’s modal referral location
10:366:32028:15:15:72:226:411:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:received 79 percent of her referrals.
10:367:32065:15:15:86:539:396:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:As we illustrate in Panel C of Table 2, one consequence of this is that, in order for patients and insurers
10:368:32172:15:15:72:540:381:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:to save money, patients need to diverge from referring physicians’ established referral patterns. Indeed, if
10:369:32280:15:15:72:540:366:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:each patient received an MRI from the modal location where his or her orthopedist referred patients, it would
10:370:32389:15:15:72:540:351:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:result in only a 10.72 percent reduction in MRI spending and achieve only 19.65 percent of the maximum

10:373:32548:22:15:71:539:277:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:The ownership structure of the practices where referring physicians work also influences where patients
10:374:32651:15:15:72:540:262:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:receive care.  As we describe in Panel B of Table 1, 14 percent of orthopedic surgeons in our sample
10:375:32751:15:15:71:541:247:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:worked in hospital-owned practices. Appendix Figure A.1 shows for each orthopedic surgeon in our data,
10:376:32853:15:15:72:540:232:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the share of the surgeon’s patients she sent from her practice to a hospital to receive a lower-limb MRI
10:377:32957:15:14:72:540:217:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:scan. Vertically integrated physicians are more likely to send patients for hospital-based scans. Among
10:378:33060:14:15:72:540:203:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:non-vertically-integrated referring physicians, the mean orthopedic surgeon sent 19 percent of her patients for

10:382:33401:15:15:71:540:143:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:variable is either the total price of an MRI, the patient contribution, the insurer contribution, the money
10:383:33508:15:15:72:540:128:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:left on the table, an indicator for whether a patient had a hospital-based scan, or an indicator for whether
10:384:33616:15:15:72:541:113:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:an MRI scan was repeated. In addition to controlling for patient characteristics and the patient’s HRR,
10:385:33719:15:15:71:539:98:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:we include an indicator for whether a patient’s referring physician is part of a hospital-owned practice. We
10:386:33827:15:0:72:540:83:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:observe that patients with a vertically integrated referring physician were 27 percentage points more likely to
11:387:33939:0:15:72:540:710:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:receive a hospital-based MRI and had scans that were $277.19 more expensive. This results in an additional

11:389:34150:33:25:72:285:662:206:g_d0_f4:206:g_d0_f4:C:4  Discussion and Conclusions
11:390:34179:25:15:71:539:637:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:We explore the extent to which patients currently shop for health care by examining how individuals with
11:391:34283:15:15:72:540:622:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:private health insurance currently consume pre-planned lower-limb MRI scans. Lower-limb MRI scans are a
11:392:34386:15:14:72:540:607:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:useful procedure to study for this analysis because they are plausibly homogenous and can be planned in
11:393:34489:14:15:72:540:593:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:advance by patients. We posit that if patients do not effectively choose an imaging provider, they are likely
11:394:34598:15:15:72:451:578:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:to struggle when they make even more complicated health care consumption decisions.
11:395:34681:15:15:86:539:563:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:A:We find that, on average, patients travel past six lower-priced providers in route to where they received
11:396:34786:15:15:72:540:548:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:care. Indeed, we find that if patients had attended the lowest cost provider within the distance they already
11:397:34895:15:15:72:540:533:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:travelled, they could have reduced their out-of-pocket costs by $83.93 (27.47 percent) and insurer spending
11:398:35002:15:15:72:540:518:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:by $220.52 (40.50 percent). Patients’ out-of-pocket cost exposure explained only 2.37 percent of the variance
11:399:35111:15:15:72:540:503:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:in MRI price prices and 2.29 percent of the money left on the table (these represent 4.24 percent and 4.19
11:400:35217:15:15:72:540:488:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:percent, respectively, of the explained variance). Moreover, despite mean out-of-pocket costs of over $300.00
11:401:35326:15:15:72:540:473:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:per scan, less than 1 percent of individuals in our sample searched for the price of lower-limb MRI scans
11:402:35431:15:15:72:165:458:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:before accessing care.
11:403:35453:15:15:86:539:443:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Ultimately, we find that a patient’s referring physician is the strongest determinant of the cost of the
11:404:35557:15:15:72:540:428:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:MRI scan that a patient receives, the money that they leave on the table, and whether or not they receive a
11:405:35664:15:15:72:540:413:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:hospital-based MRI scan. In our decomposition, referring physician fixed effects explain 51.47 percent of the
11:406:35773:15:15:71:539:398:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:variance in price of an MRI a patient received (92.08 percent of the explained variance). Our results speak to
11:407:35883:15:15:72:540:383:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:the importance of the agency relationship in determining where patients receive care. We observe that the
11:408:35988:15:15:72:540:368:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:median referring physician (orthopedic surgeons in our sample) refers patients to three MRI providers, while
11:409:36096:15:15:72:540:353:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:the modal location where they send their patients captures 79 percent of their referrals. As a result, in order
11:410:36207:15:14:72:540:338:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:to attend a cheaper MRI provider, patients need to be diverted from their physicians’ pre-established referral
11:411:36317:14:15:72:540:324:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:pathways. These results indicate that in order to lower MRI spending, insurers could work with physicians
11:412:36422:15:15:72:540:309:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:themselves to influence where they sent their patients, narrow provider networks, or introduce such strong
11:413:36528:15:15:72:502:294:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:incentives to patients that they request different referrals or seek out different referring physicians.
11:414:36632:15:15:86:539:279:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:However, modifying referral patterns is complicated because physicians’ referrals are linked to the
11:415:36731:15:15:72:540:264:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:ownership structure of their medical practices. Patients who were treated by an orthopedic surgeon working
11:416:36837:15:15:72:541:249:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:in a hospital-owned practice received more expensive MRI scans, left more money on the table, and were 27
11:417:36942:15:15:72:299:234:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:percent more likely to receive a hospital-based scan.
11:418:36995:15:15:86:539:219:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Our evidence suggests that, at present, patients in our sample do not ‘shop’ for care. This is in spite
11:419:37098:15:15:72:540:204:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:of significant out-of-pocket costs, ready access to a price transparency tool, and the opportunity to reduce
11:420:37206:15:15:72:540:189:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:their spot price without traveling longer distances. Going forward, our findings suggest that because of the
11:421:37314:15:15:71:539:174:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:weight patients appear to place on the advice of their referring physicians, it is unlikely that a significant
11:422:37424:15:15:72:540:159:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:number of patients will use information from an app or from a pricing webpage to diverge from where their
11:423:37529:15:15:72:540:144:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:physicians typically send patients for imaging studies. Given that we observe these results for patients
11:424:37633:15:15:72:540:129:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:consuming lower-limb MRI scans, it is even less likely that patients will actively price shop for more complex
11:425:37743:15:12:72:188:114:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:and differentiated services.
11:426:37771:12:13:83:540:102:36:g_d0_f9:64:g_d0_f10:F:3One argument in favor of vertical integration between physicians and hospitals is that it could increase care coordination
11:427:37894:13:9:72:540:89:62:g_d0_f10:62:g_d0_f10:F:between providers (Baicker and Levy 2013). While this is a possibility we cannot exclude, because the cases we examine are not
11:428:38020:9:0:72:509:80:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:emergencies, there is time to get the scan to the orthopedist without any adverse impact on the health of the patient.
12:429:38140:0:15:86:539:710:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:Our work has direct implications for the study of health care markets and for public policy. Most models
12:430:38244:15:15:72:540:695:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:of how patients choose where to receive care do not explicitly model the role of referring physicians and often
12:431:38355:15:15:72:540:680:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:find that the distance between patients and providers is the primary determinant of where patients receive

12:433:38566:15:15:72:540:650:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:receives care in an emergency, our work suggests that for care where individuals rely on the advice of their
12:434:38674:15:15:72:540:635:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:referring physicians, referring physicians’ preferences may dominate the effects of cost-sharing and distance in
12:435:38786:15:15:72:540:620:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:determining where patients receive care. Our work therefore suggests that economists should integrate the
12:436:38891:15:15:72:445:605:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:impact of agency into models of patient choice, particularly in non-emergent settings.
12:437:38977:15:15:86:539:590:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:On the policy front, over the last 20 years, much of the focus for insurers has been on determining how to
12:438:39083:15:15:72:540:575:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:use demand side cost sharing to drive patients to consume health care more efficiently. Our results, consistent

12:440:39303:15:15:72:540:545:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:influencing patients’ choices. Our results indicate that while demand side cost sharing may reduce the rates
12:441:39411:15:15:72:541:530:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:that individuals access care (with uncertain impacts on welfare), once individuals meet with their physician,
12:442:39520:15:15:72:540:515:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:they rely heavily on their physician’s advice in deciding where to receive subsequent care. This suggests
12:443:39625:15:15:72:540:500:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:that insurers should work to steer their beneficiaries towards lower priced providers and towards referring
12:444:39732:15:15:72:540:485:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:physicians that make lower-priced referrals, and that policy-makers and insurers should work to incentivize
12:445:39839:15:15:72:539:470:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:physicians to make more efficient referrals. In short, price conscious referring physicians are likely to be
12:446:39947:15:32:72:295:455:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:crucial for raising the price elasticity of MRI scans.

22:598:58800:25:14:71:540:682:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Advanced imaging studies – MRIs and computed tomography (CT) scans – account for approximately 3
22:599:58896:14:15:72:540:668:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:percent of health spending (Iglehart 2009). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was double-digit increase
22:600:59006:15:15:71:539:653:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:year on year in the rate that advanced imaging studies were being performed, in spite of evidence suggesting
22:601:59114:15:15:72:540:638:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:that nearly half of studies performed may have been unnecessary (Lee and Levy 2012; Litkowski 2016). In
22:602:59217:15:15:72:540:623:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:addition to increasing cost sharing and promoting price transparency, insurers have increasingly required
22:603:59322:15:15:72:540:608:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:that physicians obtain prior approval for advanced imaging studies before the payers will fund them for their
22:604:59431:15:15:72:540:593:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:beneficiaries. It is estimated that approximately half of insurance plans involve prior authorizations and that
22:605:59542:15:15:72:540:578:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:between 10 and 20 percent of imaging studies are denied during this process (Lee and Levy 2012; Iglehart
22:606:59646:15:15:71:539:563:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:2009). While some research has suggested that prior authorizations have reduced the rates at which advanced
22:607:59753:15:15:72:540:548:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:imaging studies are performed, there is little evidence that introducing price transparency and encouraging
22:608:59860:15:15:72:227:533:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:patient shopping has been effective.
22:609:59896:15:15:86:539:518:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:Most analysis of the impact of health care transparency tools on patient shopping have found that they
22:610:59998:15:15:72:541:503:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:have had very little effect, in part, because they are rarely used by patients. Lieber (2017) and Whaley,
22:611:60103:15:15:72:540:488:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:Schneider Chafen, and Pinkard (2014) estimate that users of price transparency tools save approximately 15
22:612:60209:15:15:72:540:473:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:percent on the price of imaging services. However, Brown (2017) found that only 8 percent of consumers
22:613:60311:15:15:72:540:458:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:having an MRI scan used New Hampshire’s transparency website before accessing care. Likewise, Lieber
22:614:60411:15:15:70:539:443:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:(2017) found that at a large restaurant chain, only 12 percent of the employees searched for price information
22:615:60521:15:15:72:540:428:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:at least once. Similarly, Desai et al. (2017) found that at a sample of large private firms, fewer than 10
22:616:60627:15:14:72:540:413:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:percent of individuals offered the transparency tool used it. These results echo findings from a national survey
22:617:60739:14:15:72:540:399:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:that suggested only three percent of non-elderly individuals in the U.S. had compared prices across providers
22:618:60848:15:15:72:540:384:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:before receiving care (Mehrotra et al. 2017). Our data allows us to identify the date that individuals access

22:620:61031:15:15:86:539:354:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:A:Both Lieber (2017) and Brown (2017) suggest that the use of transparency tools would increase if
22:621:61127:15:15:72:540:339:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:individuals were more directly exposed to the price of health care services. This proposition is supported
22:622:61233:15:15:72:540:324:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:by theory modeled by Dionne and Eeckhoudt (1984) and Akın and Platt (2014). Brown (2016) estimates
22:623:61331:15:15:72:540:309:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:that if individuals had a 50 percent co-insurance rate, this would lead to a 38 percent increase in the
22:624:61434:15:15:72:540:294:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:number of consumers using price shopping tools. Likewise, Lieber (2017) estimated that individuals who
22:625:61536:15:15:72:540:279:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:met their deductibles were 1.5 percentage points less likely to search for price information. However, when
22:626:61643:15:15:72:540:264:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) examined the impact of switching individuals at a large firm from first dollar
22:627:61749:15:15:72:540:249:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:coverage to high deductible health plans, they did not observe an increase in price shopping in the year the
22:628:61857:15:15:72:540:234:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:switch took place or in the second year after the switch. In fact, virtually all the reduction in spending that
22:629:61968:15:15:72:540:219:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) observed following the introduction of deductibles came from patients reducing
22:630:62074:15:15:72:237:204:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:the quantity of health care consumed.
22:631:62111:15:15:86:539:189:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:In the face of lackluster results from increasing deductibles and introducing price transparency tools, some
22:632:62219:15:15:72:540:174:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:private employers have introduced reference pricing schemes to steer individuals to lower cost providers. In
22:633:62327:15:14:72:540:159:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:a reference pricing program, beneficiaries are enrolled in plans where the payer will only fund care up to
22:634:62433:14:15:72:542:145:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:the price of the provider in the (for example) 60th percentile of prices in the region where the patient lives.
22:635:62544:15:15:71:539:130:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:These programs involve even greater potential out-of-pocket exposure for patients, although they can be
22:636:62647:15:15:72:540:115:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:simpler if there is a list of providers that are below the threshold. A recent analysis found that individuals in
22:637:62760:15:15:72:540:100:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:a reference pricing program received MRIs that were 12.5 percent lower priced than matched individuals that
22:638:62867:15:0:71:315:85:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:were not in a reference price program (robinson2016).
23:639:62922:0:15:86:539:710:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:One understudied potential explanation for why consumers do not price shop is the weight patients place
23:640:63025:15:15:72:540:695:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:on advice from their referring physicians about where to receive care. Survey data suggests that patients rely
23:641:63135:15:15:72:540:680:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:heavily on the advice of their physicians when determining where to receive care (Harris 2003) though they
23:642:63241:15:15:72:542:665:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:may not know the reason why a particular provider is being recommended (e.g. location, friendship tie, etc).
23:643:63349:15:15:72:540:650:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:Patients can be uncertain about many aspects of their care, including what services are necessary and the
23:644:63454:15:15:72:540:635:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:quality of providers from whom they could receive treatment. This, as Arrow (1963) noted, gives rise to the
23:645:63561:15:15:72:315:620:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:need for physicians to serve as agents for their patients.
23:646:63619:15:15:86:539:605:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:A:Decades of literature focusing on health care and other sectors has explored the agency relationship and
23:647:63723:15:15:72:540:590:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:found that agency is often imperfect (Hubbard 1998; Levitt and Syverson 2008). Within the health care
23:648:63824:15:15:72:540:575:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:sector, there is a large literature that suggests the presence of supplier induced demand, where patients are
23:649:63933:15:15:72:540:560:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:encouraged by providers to utilize services they do not need in order to reap financial gain (Gruber and
23:650:64037:15:15:72:540:545:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Owings 1996). Physicians may also gain directly or indirectly from the imaging referrals they make. In the
23:651:64143:15:15:71:539:530:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:1990s, laws were passed that prohibited physicians from referring patients to facilities where the physicians
23:652:64252:15:15:72:540:515:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:had an ownership stake (these are often referred to as the Stark laws). However, the law allows physicians
23:653:64358:15:15:72:540:500:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:to own their own imaging equipment, refer patients to receive scans from inside their owned facilities, and
23:654:64465:15:15:72:540:485:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:benefit directly. Physicians may also gain indirectly from making referrals within the system where they are
23:655:64573:15:15:72:273:470:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:employed (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2016).
23:656:64617:15:14:86:539:455:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:If physicians were perfect agents for patients, we would expect that aspects of care that are important to
23:657:64723:14:15:72:540:441:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:the patient (such as out-of-pocket costs) to influence referral choices even if the patient had no direct input
23:658:64834:15:15:72:539:426:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:into the decision. However, the referrals physicians make may differ from the choices that would be made
23:659:64938:15:15:72:540:411:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:by a perfectly informed patient, both because the physician may not be fully informed about the patient
23:660:65041:15:15:72:542:396:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:preferences and patients’ out of pocket costs, and because maximizing patient welfare may not be physicians’
23:661:65149:15:33:72:245:381:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:only objective when they refer patients.

23:664:65290:21:15:71:540:291:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:We build an analytic sample of claims for the most common MRI scan in our data: lower extremity MRIs
23:665:65390:15:15:72:540:276:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:performed without contrast.4We identify lower-limb MRIs in our data as those cases involving either a
23:666:65491:15:15:72:540:261:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:physician or facility claim with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code of 73721. We identify whether
23:667:65597:15:15:72:444:246:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:or not a scan was performed in a hospital using the place of service codes on a claim.
23:668:65683:15:15:86:539:231:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Our goal is to identify shoppable, homogenous MRI scans. As a result, we limit our analysis to MRI scans
23:669:65787:15:15:72:540:216:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:taken during visits where no health care services were provided on the claim other than the “reading” and

23:671:65996:15:15:72:540:186:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:inpatient stay or as part of an emergency episode, since patients in these cases are unlikely to be able to
23:672:66103:15:15:72:540:171:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:actively choose where to receive care (less than 1 percent of cases). We limit our analysis to individuals age 19
23:673:66216:15:15:72:540:156:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:to 64, exclude cases where there were coordinated benefits (i.e. our insurer co-funded the care with another
23:674:66324:15:15:72:540:141:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:insurer) (10 percent of cases), exclude cases where the MRI provider was more than a two hour drive from

23:677:66657:12:10:72:540:99:65:g_d0_f10:65:g_d0_f10:F:soft tissue, but require the patient to be injected with a contrasting agent called gadolinium. In this analysis, we focus on
23:678:66782:10:0:72:540:89:63:g_d0_f10:63:g_d0_f10:F:lower-limb MRI scans performed without contrast. MRI scans without contrast make up the vast majority of scans in our data.
24:679:66907:0:15:72:540:710:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:percent of cases).5We also restrict our analysis to MRI scans performed on individuals who were continuously
24:680:67015:15:15:72:540:695:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:enrolled for at least three months in a point of service (POS) insurance product (the modal insurance product
24:681:67124:15:15:72:539:680:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:offered by our data contributor). We focus on individuals with POS plans because network breadth and the
24:682:67228:15:15:72:541:665:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:prices insurers have negotiated with providers may differ across the types of insurance products they offer.
24:683:67336:15:38:71:475:650:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:Applying these restrictions to our data leaves us with an initial sample of 88,292 MRI scans.

24:685:67476:21:15:72:540:591:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:Nearly all of the beneficiaries in our data needed to have their MRI scan prior authorized by the insurer before
24:686:67588:15:15:72:540:576:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the scan would be funded by the insurer. We have data that identifies the physician who requested each
24:687:67690:15:15:72:540:561:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:patient’s prior authorization. We can identify the specialties of physicians who ask for prior authorization of
24:688:67801:15:15:72:540:546:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:lower-limb MRI scans. The prior authorization data from our insurer indicates that the majority of physicians
24:689:67910:15:15:71:539:531:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:who order prior authorizations for lower-limb MRI scans are orthopedic surgeons. As a result, in order to
24:690:68015:15:15:72:540:516:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:identify the referring physicians for each lower-limb MRI scan in our data, we use the claims history of each
24:691:68124:15:15:72:540:501:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:patient in our sample to find patients who receive a lower-limb MRI scan and have at least one office visit
24:692:68231:15:15:71:539:486:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:with an orthopedic surgeon within three months of the taking of an MRI scan.6We restrict our analysis to
24:693:68335:15:15:72:540:471:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:patients who saw an orthopedist within three months of a scan so that we can assume that the orthopedist a
24:694:68441:15:15:72:296:456:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:patient saw before a scan is the referring physician.

24:696:68595:15:15:72:540:426:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:eliminates 36,652 of 88,292 cases. The remaining 51,640 cases are divided as follows. In 93 percent of these
24:697:68703:15:15:72:541:411:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:cases, patients only saw a single orthopedic surgeon before a scan took place. In 7 percent of cases, however,
24:698:68813:15:15:72:540:396:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:the patient saw two or more different orthopedic surgeons before a scan occurred. For such patients, we
24:699:68916:15:15:72:540:381:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:identify whether the patient saw an orthopedic surgeon after the scan. We assume that the orthopedic surgeon
24:700:69024:15:15:71:540:366:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:who saw the patient both before and after the scan was the referring physician. This captures 68 percent
24:701:69128:15:15:72:540:351:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:of the cases where patients saw two or more orthopedists before a scan. We exclude the remaining 1,153
24:702:69230:15:14:72:540:336:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:cases (2 percent of 51,640 cases) that cannot be categorized this way.7After excluding those observations
24:703:69335:14:15:72:540:322:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:and three observations for which the patient was the only person in their HRR to receive a lower-limb MRI
24:704:69440:15:15:72:540:307:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:scan, we are left with a final analytic sample size of 50,484.8When we transition to analyzing the behavior of

24:706:69659:15:38:72:471:277:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:MRIs for patients in our sample population. Doing so excludes 14,619 patient observations.

24:708:69785:22:14:71:541:217:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:We use place of service codes to identify whether an MRI scan was delivered inside or outside a hospital.
24:709:69890:14:15:72:540:203:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:For hospital-based MRIs, we observe a physician claim for the “reading” of the MRI scan and a facility
24:710:69992:15:15:72:540:188:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:claim for the “taking” of the MRI scan (this is identified via the presence of a CPT code of 73721). We
24:711:70095:15:15:72:540:173:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:calculate the total price of a hospital-based MRI scan as the sum of the service lines on the physician and
24:712:70202:15:15:72:542:158:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:facility claims with a CPT code of 73721 that occurred on the same date with the same patient identifier.
24:713:70307:15:12:83:540:143:36:g_d0_f9:62:g_d0_f10:F:5Our data divides patients into five-year age bands. However, individuals aged 18 years are lumped in with individuals under
24:714:70431:12:7:72:511:131:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:age 18. Since 18 year-old individuals could not be distinguished from minors, we focused on individuals aged 19 to 64.
24:715:70549:7:9:83:447:124:36:g_d0_f9:64:g_d0_f10:F:6We identify an orthopedic surgeon by the physician’s National Provider Identifier (NPI) number.
24:716:70645:9:13:83:540:115:36:g_d0_f9:63:g_d0_f10:F:7These include cases where 1) the patient saw multiple orthopedists both before and after a scan; 2) the patient visited with
24:717:70770:13:9:72:540:102:62:g_d0_f10:62:g_d0_f10:F:multiple orthopedists before the scan but none afterwards; and 3) the patient saw multiple orthopedists before the scan and saw
24:718:70897:9:7:72:496:93:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:one or more orthopedists after the scan who were not the same orthopedists as the ones they saw before the MRI.
24:719:71008:7:12:83:540:86:36:g_d0_f9:62:g_d0_f10:F:8We do this to remain consistent with rules in our data use agreement that preclude us from analyzing HRRs with very small
24:720:71130:12:0:72:137:74:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:numbers of cases.

25:723:71362:15:38:72:216:680:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:claim with a CPT code of 73721.
25:724:71393:38:22:72:487:642:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:?:B.4  Constructing Patients’ Choice Sets and Identifying Counterfactual Payments
25:725:71472:22:15:72:540:620:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:For each patient who underwent an MRI in our sample, we construct a choice set of MRI providers within a
25:726:71576:15:14:72:540:605:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:60-minute drive of each patient’s home. To do so, we begin by identifying every provider that delivered an
25:727:71682:14:15:72:540:591:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:MRI scan to a patient in our sample. Next, we calculate travel times between each patient’s home ZIP code
25:728:71787:15:15:70:539:576:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:(ZCTA) and the addresses of all providers within 100 miles of the patient’s ZIP. This is done using the online
25:729:71897:15:15:72:540:561:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:routing API (application programming interface) provided by “Here”, a commercial mapping company. The
25:730:71998:15:15:71:540:546:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:“Here” software uses average traffic patterns and user reported data to estimate travel time, by car, between
25:731:72107:15:15:72:540:531:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f5:B:two locations. By using travel time instead of distance, we allow patients in rural areas to travel farther in
25:732:72217:15:15:72:364:516:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:the same amount of time than patients in densely populated cities.
25:733:72283:15:15:86:539:501:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:The price of an MRI at each provider is calculated as the average of the inflation-adjusted prices of scans
25:734:72390:15:15:72:540:486:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:at that provider during our time period. The price we calculate includes the payments for the taking and
25:735:72494:15:15:72:539:471:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:reading of an MRI scan.9Our combined price is the allowed amount, so it includes both the patient and
25:736:72595:15:15:72:540:456:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:insurer contributions to total payment for a scan. We then estimate what patients and our data contributor
25:737:72701:15:15:71:540:441:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:would pay for a lower-limb MRI scan at alternate, lower-priced providers.10While we do not directly observe
25:738:72808:15:15:72:540:426:101:g_d0_f5:101:g_d0_f5:B:beneficiaries’ plan characteristics, we can infer plan benefit designs from our data. To infer what patients
25:739:72916:15:15:71:541:411:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:would have paid at lower-priced locations, we rely on two facts. First, when moved to a lower priced provider,
25:740:73026:15:15:72:540:396:97:g_d0_f5:97:g_d0_f5:F:a patient will never pay more towards her deductible than she did on her original episode. Second, coinsurance
25:741:73136:15:15:72:539:381:98:g_d0_f5:98:g_d0_f5:F:rates can be inferred for all patients who exceed their deductible and need to pay coinsurance.11Our task of
25:742:73244:15:216:72:538:366:99:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f5:B:inferring co-insurance is made easier by the fact that patients in our sample do not pay fixed co-payments.
25:743:73351:216:12:83:540:150:36:g_d0_f9:63:g_d0_f10:F:9Non-hospital-based scans include the reading and taking of an MRI scan on a single physician service line. Hospital-based
25:744:73473:12:10:72:541:138:63:g_d0_f10:63:g_d0_f10:F:scans include a physician and a facility claim. Because two different hospital-based MRI cases may involve different radiologists,
25:745:73603:10:9:71:539:128:63:g_d0_f10:63:g_d0_f10:F:when we calculate the average combined price of the taking and reading of a scan at a hospital, we also use the average price of
25:746:73731:9:7:72:207:119:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:the readings of scans at that facility.
25:747:73770:7:12:79:540:112:36:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f10:F:10We do not need to calculate the level of counterfactual prices at facilities with a higher allowed amount than the chosen
25:748:73893:12:7:72:328:100:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:facility because these are not used in our counterfactual calculations.
25:749:73964:7:12:79:539:93:36:g_d0_f9:62:g_d0_f10:F:11We assume the coinsurance ratecthat we observe for patientiwho received care at providerjwould be the same co-insurance
25:750:74085:12:9:72:540:81:62:g_d0_f10:62:g_d0_f10:F:rate that patientiwould pay at other locations. This is an assumption that our data contributor has told us applies in virtually
25:751:74213:9:0:72:406:72:64:g_d0_f10:64:g_d0_f10:F:every case in the data. The insurer in our data does not have co-payments for MRI scans.
