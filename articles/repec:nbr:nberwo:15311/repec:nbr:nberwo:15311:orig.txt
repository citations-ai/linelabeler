2:30:1652:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Many studies find that households increase their consumption after the receipt of expected income
2:31:1749:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:payments, a result inconsistent with the life-cycle/permanent income hypothesis.  Consumption can
2:32:1846:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:increase adverse health events, such as traffic accidents, heart attacks and strokes.  In this paper, we
2:33:1950:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:examine the short-term mortality consequences of income receipt.  We find that mortality increases
2:34:2048:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:following the arrival of monthly Social Security payments, regular wage payments for military personnel,
2:35:2152:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:the 2001 tax rebates, and Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payments.  The increase in short-run mortality
2:36:2255:14:42:72:478:504:12:Times:12:Times:is large, potentially eliminating some of the protective benefits of additional income.

3:51:2634:0:20:108:497:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The life cycle-permanent income hypothesis (LC/PIH) is widely used in modern 
3:52:2711:20:21:71:512:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:macroeconomic theory to model how households allocate consumption across time.  A key 
3:53:2797:21:21:71:505:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:implication of the model is that predictable and certain changes in income should have no 
3:54:2887:21:20:71:495:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect on consumption once they occur.  Over the past 15 years, authors have used high-
3:55:2974:20:21:71:507:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:frequency survey data on consumption to test this prediction.  Among the income changes 
3:56:3062:21:21:71:516:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that have been exploited in this context are increases in union wages (Shea, 1995); a change 
3:57:3155:21:20:71:492:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in federal tax withholding (Shapiro and Slemrod, 1995); changes in Social Security tax 
3:58:3242:20:21:71:517:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:payments (Parker, 1999); income tax refunds (Souleles, 1999); the arrival of Social Security 
3:59:3335:21:21:72:522:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:payments (Stephens, 2003); the receipt of tax stimulus checks (Johnson, Parker and Souleles, 
3:60:3428:21:21:72:500:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2006); the arrival of paychecks (Stephens, 2006); and Alaska Permanent Fund dividends 
3:61:3514:21:20:72:524:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(Hsieh, 2003).  All but one of these studies (Hsieh, 2003) find consumption behavior displays 
3:62:3608:20:21:72:509:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“excess sensitivity” to expected changes in income, a result inconsistent with the LC/PIH.  
3:63:3700:21:21:108:521:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In this paper, we consider a related but largely unexplored question: if income receipt 
3:64:3788:21:20:71:504:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increases consumption, does it affect mortality?  While the potential relationship between 
3:65:3879:20:21:71:509:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consumption and mortality is obvious in cases like traffic fatalities – since increased travel 
3:66:3974:21:21:71:505:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increases the likelihood of an accident – other causes of death also have well-documented 
3:67:4064:21:20:71:512:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:links to consumption.  For example, many triggers for heart attacks and strokes are activity-
3:68:4157:20:21:71:494:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:related, and hence if an income payment increases economic activity, one may expect a 
3:69:4243:21:21:71:516:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher incidence of heart attacks to follow.1  Likewise, Ruhm (2000) shows that mortality is 
3:70:4336:21:20:72:418:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pro-cyclical, suggesting a deadly aspect to increased economic activity. 
3:71:4409:20:21:108:524:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:We use various versions of the Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) data, a census of all 
3:72:4493:21:21:72:513:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deaths in the United States, to examine the income receipt/short-run mortality link for three 
3:73:4587:21:21:72:522:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cases already considered within the LC/PIH literature, as well as two new tests.  We examine 
3:74:4680:21:20:72:513:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the mortality consequences of (1) the receipt of Social Security payments on the 3rd of each 
3:75:4773:20:21:72:508:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month, (2) changes in the Social Security payment schedule to one based on beneficiaries’ 
3:76:4863:21:21:72:499:191:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:dates of birth, (3) receipt of military wages on the 1st and 15th day of each month, (4) the 
3:77:4956:21:45:72:497:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:2001 federal tax rebates, and (5) the annual Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payments. 
3:78:5042:45:9:72:218:125:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
3:79:5102:9:17:72:511:116:49:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f1:1 Triggers for heart attacks include getting out of bed (Elliott, 2001), returning to work on Mondays (Witte et 
3:80:5214:17:11:72:494:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:al., 2005), shoveling snow (Heppell et al. 1991), the Christmas season (Phillips et al., 2004) and physical 
3:81:5322:11:0:72:384:88:100:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:exertion (Albert et al. 2000).  Similar triggers have been observed for strokes. 
4:82:5406:0:20:108:519:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In all cases, we find that mortality increases after the receipt of income.  Seniors who 
4:83:5495:20:21:72:518:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enrolled in Social Security prior to May 1997 typically received their Social Security checks 
4:84:5589:21:21:72:514:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on the 3rd of the month.  For this group, mortality declines just before paycheck receipt, and 
4:85:5684:21:20:72:514:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is highest the day after checks are received.  For those who enrolled in Social Security after 
4:86:5779:20:21:71:518:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:April 1997, benefits are paid on either the 2nd, 3rd or 4th Wednesday of the month, depending 
4:87:5873:21:21:72:497:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on beneficiaries’ birth dates.  Among this group, mortality is highest on the days checks 
4:88:5963:21:20:72:505:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:arrive.  Similar results are found in counties with a large military presence, with mortality 
4:89:6057:20:21:72:511:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among 17-64 year olds increasing by nearly 12 percent the day after mid-month paychecks 
4:90:6145:21:21:71:493:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:arrive, while over the same period there is no change in mortality in counties with little 
4:91:6236:21:21:71:515:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:military presence.  During the week the 2001 tax rebate checks arrived, mortality among 25-
4:92:6327:21:20:72:503:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:64 year olds increased by 2.5 percent.  During the week that direct deposits of Permanent 
4:93:6417:20:21:72:482:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Fund dividends are made, mortality among urban Alaskans increases by 13 percent.   
4:94:6500:21:21:108:502:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Our work helps illuminate and broaden three disparate literatures.  The first is the 
4:95:6585:21:20:72:521:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:literature on the LC/PIH.  Most tests of this hypothesis rely on consumption data such as that 
4:96:6680:20:21:72:512:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:found in the Consumer Expenditures Survey (CEX).  While these datasets do a good job of 
4:97:6768:21:21:72:508:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measuring recurring monthly expenditures such as housing and car payments, they do less 
4:98:6856:21:20:72:518:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:well in measuring goods that are the focus of LC/PIH tests, like alcohol and food away from 
4:99:6948:20:21:72:502:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:home (Meyer and Sullivan, 2009).  In contrast, mortality is exceptionally well-measured, 
4:100:7037:21:21:72:523:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:even at the daily level, and our dataset includes all deaths in the United States.  If mortality is 
4:101:7137:21:20:72:495:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:viewed as an ex post measure of market activity, our results provide further evidence of 
4:102:7226:20:21:72:453:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:widespread increases in economic activity after predictable changes in income. 
4:103:7305:21:21:108:508:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second, our analysis is similar in structure and content to a related group of papers 
4:104:7391:21:21:72:498:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:found in the medical literature that argues there is an increase in substance abuse-related 
4:105:7483:21:20:72:495:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mortality following payments to welfare recipients.  Sometimes called the ‘full wallets’ 
4:106:7572:20:21:72:497:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hypothesis, work by Verhuel, Singer and Christenson (1997), Maynard and Cox (2000), 
4:107:7656:21:21:72:514:191:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Riddell and Riddell (2006), Li et al. (2007), and especially Dobkin and Puller (2007) shows 
4:108:7748:21:20:72:506:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:convincingly that problems associated with substance abuse increase after federal transfer 
4:109:7839:20:21:72:515:150:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:program payments.  Our work demonstrates that the effect of income receipt on mortality is 
4:110:7930:21:0:72:527:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not limited to recipients of federal transfer programs and to deaths involving substance abuse.  
5:111:8030:0:20:108:508:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Finally, our work also has important implications for the large literature on income 
5:112:8115:20:21:72:514:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and health (Kitigawa and Hauser, 1973; Deaton, 2003).  While this research has established 
5:113:8206:21:21:72:516:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:robust correlations, it has failed to identify the causal nature of the relationship.  The factors 
5:114:8305:21:20:71:522:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that lead one to have a high income or socioeconomic status (e.g. intelligence, discount rates) 
5:115:8401:20:21:71:510:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:may also improve health outcomes.  In fact, another literature has established that negative 
5:116:8494:21:21:71:482:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:health shocks reduce earnings and increase health care spending,2 suggesting that the 
5:117:8580:21:20:72:493:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:direction of causation may run from health to income.  Given this possibility of reverse 
5:118:8669:20:21:72:521:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:causation and the lack of an obvious causal pathway from income to health, Deaton (2003, p. 
5:119:8761:21:21:72:501:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:118) notes, “...much of the economics literature has been skeptical about any causal link 
5:120:8851:21:21:72:518:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from income to health, and instead tends to emphasize causality in the opposite direction...” 
5:121:8945:21:20:108:504:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In recent years, authors have tested whether socioeconomic status causally affects 
5:122:9028:20:21:72:518:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:health by using exogenous variation in education3 and income.4  While the results exploiting

5:124:9210:21:20:72:521:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:there are conflicting results among studies using variation in income.  Our results below may 
5:125:9304:20:21:71:499:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be instructive for this literature.  First, some of the longer-term gains from an exogenous 
5:126:9396:21:21:71:522:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in income may be negated by the short-run phenomena we detect.  This may explain 
5:127:9486:21:20:71:507:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:why consistent results have been hard to find.  Second, these short-run effects may impact 
5:128:9577:20:21:71:491:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the efficacy of cash transfers, which some authors – despite the misgivings outlined by 
5:129:9665:21:21:71:505:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Deaton – have suggested as a way of reducing health inequalities between income levels.  
5:130:9754:21:20:71:516:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:For example, a 1998 United Kingdom Government report recommended an increase in cash 
5:131:9839:20:21:71:523:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:benefits as a direct way to improve health outcomes in the lowest income groups.5  A number 
5:132:9931:21:21:72:497:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of scholars who have attempted to empirically measure the link between socioeconomic 
5:133:10016:21:21:72:508:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:status and health have expressed similar sentiments.6  Our results suggest that the negative 
5:134:10109:21:29:72:485:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:short-run consequences of these transfers must be considered in any such evaluation.

5:136:10255:7:12:72:408:196:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 For example, see Bound, 1989, Haveman et al., 1995, and especially Smith, 1999. 
5:137:10337:12:16:72:519:184:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3 For example, authors have examined whether health outcomes are altered by increases in education generated 
5:138:10446:16:11:72:513:168:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:by policies such as compulsory schooling (Lleras-Muney, 2003), an increase in access to colleges (Currie and 
5:139:10555:11:7:72:420:157:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Moretti, 2003) and the Vietnam Draft (de Walque, 2007; Grimand and Parent, 2007).   
5:140:10639:7:16:72:498:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:4 Such work exploits variation in income produced by such factors as winning the lottery (Lindahl, 2005), 
5:141:10745:16:12:71:516:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:German reunification (Fritjers, Hasken-DeNew and Shields, 2005), receiving an inheritance (Meer, Miller and

5:144:11028:11:16:72:518:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:6 Marmot (2002, p. 43) notes that redistribution would improve overall health by “relieving the fate of the poor 
5:145:11141:16:0:71:518:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:more than it hurt the rich."  Wilkinson (in Gly and Miliband, 1994) argues, “[t]he health evidence suggests that 
6:146:11257:0:20:108:461:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In the next section, we examine how regular payments to Social Security 
6:147:11329:20:21:72:515:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:beneficiaries and military personnel affect short-term mortality.  In both cases we find large 
6:148:11424:21:21:72:507:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increases in mortality immediately after the receipt of income, and that these increases are 
6:149:11517:21:20:72:312:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not just among deaths involving substance abuse. 
6:150:11566:20:21:108:503:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Given the recurring nature of these two events, we are unable to examine whether 
6:151:11647:21:21:72:509:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increases in mortality merely reflect short-term mortality displacement: mortality has been 
6:152:11739:21:20:72:517:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hastened for people who would have died soon anyway.  In section 2, we examine this issue 
6:153:11829:20:21:72:503:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by considering the one-time receipt of 2001 tax stimulus checks and the annual receipt of 
6:154:11919:21:21:72:490:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.  We find in both cases that a short-term increase in 
6:155:12005:21:21:71:523:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mortality is offset by a subsequent decrease in deaths, suggesting that much of the immediate 
6:156:12099:21:20:72:520:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect we estimate is actually short-term mortality displacement.  In section 3, we discuss the 
6:157:12195:20:21:72:458:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:implications of our work for both the LC/PIH and the income/health literature.

6:162:12522:21:20:72:511:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:broader populations by examining the mortality consequences of Social Security payments 
6:163:12610:20:21:72:514:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and military wage payments.  We also separate substance abuse from other causes of death.

6:166:12737:20:21:108:504:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Before May 1997, all Social Security recipients received checks on the 3rd of each 
6:167:12820:21:21:72:483:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month or on the previous work day when the 3rd fell on a weekend or on Labor Day.  
6:168:12903:21:21:72:507:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Stephens (2003) used the structure of payments and data from the CEX to test the LC/PIH 
6:169:12991:21:20:72:518:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and finds Social Security recipients did not smooth consumption over the month, but instead 
6:170:13083:20:21:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:spent more in the week after the receipt of checks compared to the week before its arrival.     
6:171:13179:21:21:107:482:191:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In the same way, we investigate whether Social Security recipients’ mortality 
6:172:13257:21:20:71:514:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increases immediately after they are paid.  We initially restrict our attention to before 1997, 
6:173:13353:20:21:72:498:150:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:when all beneficiaries were on the “3rd of the month” schedule.  Later in this section, we

7:179:13950:20:21:72:518:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:versions of the MCOD data file.7  The MCOD contains a unique record for each death in the 
7:180:14040:21:21:72:505:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:United States.  Data are compiled by states and reported to the National Center for Health 
7:181:14131:21:20:72:503:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Statistics (NCHS), which disseminates the data.  Each file contains information about the 
7:182:14221:20:21:72:519:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decedent, including age, gender, race, place of residence, place of death, and cause of death.  
7:183:14317:21:21:72:503:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Exact date of death was reported on public-use files from 1973 to 1988, but was removed 
7:184:14405:21:20:72:499:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from later public-use files. We obtained permission from the NCHS to use restricted-use 
7:185:14493:20:21:72:517:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:versions of the MCOD files containing exact dates of death from 1989 through 2006 at their 
7:186:14584:21:21:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Research Data Center, and we pooled these data with the 1973 to 1988 public-use files.8    
7:187:14675:21:21:107:520:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:For the “3rd of the month” analysis, we constructed a data file of all deaths from 1973 
7:188:14763:21:20:71:490:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to 1996 among those aged 65 or over.9 The Social Security Administration reports that 
7:189:14849:20:21:72:513:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:benefits were paid to 32.7 million adults aged 65 and older in 2000,10 which is 93.5 percent 
7:190:14942:21:21:72:337:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the population in this age group in the 2000 Census. 
7:191:14998:21:20:108:514:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Similar to Stephens (2003), we look at changes in mortality beginning 14 days prior 
7:192:15082:20:21:72:516:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to the day of Social Security payment.  As checks not paid on the 3rd are almost always paid 
7:193:15175:21:21:72:513:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on Fridays,11 day-of-the-week effects may obscure patterns in raw counts.  We can uncover 
7:194:15265:21:20:72:515:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these patterns, however, by regressing the natural log of daily mortality counts on weekday, 
7:195:15358:20:21:72:511:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month and year dummy variables, and averaging the residuals for the 14 days prior and the 
7:196:15448:21:21:72:504:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:14 days after checks arrive.  Figure 1 shows the results from this exercise.  Movements in 
7:197:15539:21:20:72:522:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mortality among seniors are similar to the consumption patterns in Figures 1a-1d of Stephens 
7:198:15632:20:21:72:514:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(2003), in which he shows that spending in the seven days after checks arrive is higher than 
7:199:15725:21:21:72:506:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:spending in the preceding seven days.  There is a large drop in mortality three days before 
7:200:15817:21:21:72:514:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:checks arrive.  In most months, the checks were distributed on the 3rd, so Day(-3) is usually 
7:201:15911:21:29:72:499:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the last day of the previous calendar month.  Phillips, Christenfeld, and Ryan (1999) and

7:207:16394:16:11:72:500:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:age, depending on their cohort.  Song and Manchester (2007) report that from 1998 to 2005, half of Social 
7:208:16500:11:12:72:517:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Security beneficiaries enrolled at age 62 and almost all enrolled by age 65.  Therefore, we restrict our attention 
7:209:16615:12:7:72:220:122:100:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:to decedents aged 65 years or more.

7:212:16840:7:0:72:512:92:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:11 The lone exception is that when January 3rd is a Sunday, checks are distributed on Thursday, December 31. 
8:213:16952:0:20:72:500:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Evans and Moore (2009) document a within-month mortality cycle where deaths decline 
8:214:17036:20:21:71:496:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:before the 1st of the month and rise on the 1st, which suggests that this mortality spike is 
8:215:17129:21:21:72:524:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:partly driven by a within-month cycle.12  Separate to this, however, is an increase in mortality 
8:216:17226:21:20:72:438:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of half a percent from the day before checks arrive to the day checks arrive. 
8:217:17304:20:21:108:514:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To comprehensively analyze the relationship between Social Security payments and 
8:218:17385:21:21:72:521:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:daily mortality, we construct “synthetic” months that begin 14 days prior to the day of Social 
8:219:17480:21:20:72:487:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Security payment.13  With this spacing, there will be an uneven number of days in our 
8:220:17566:20:21:72:522:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:synthetic months, since the length of the month depends on the day on which the 3rd falls and 
8:221:17660:21:21:72:506:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the number of days in the month.  These synthetic months can be anywhere from 28 to 34 
8:222:17747:21:21:72:521:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:days in length.14  Thus we divide each month into five groups: Payweek(-2) is the seven days 
8:223:17840:21:20:72:514:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f4:beginning 14 days before payday and ending on the eighth day before payday; Payweek(-1) 
8:224:17928:20:21:72:494:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is the seven days prior to payday; Payweek(1) is the seven days after payday (including 
8:225:18016:21:21:72:494:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:payday); Payweek(2) is the period from eight to 14 days after the paycheck arrives; and 
8:226:18104:21:20:72:429:439:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f1:Payweek(3) is the extraneous days before the next synthetic month starts.  
8:227:18179:20:21:108:489:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To isolate the mortality impact of receiving a Social Security check from other 
8:228:18259:21:21:72:508:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:factors, we estimate an econometric model that controls for the day-of-the-week and other 
8:229:18349:21:20:72:505:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effects.  Let Ydmy be counts of deaths for day d in synthetic month m and synthetic year y.  
8:230:18442:20:21:72:522:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Days are organized in relation to Social Security payments, so d=-1 is the day before payday, 
8:231:18536:21:21:72:336:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f1:d=1 is payday, and so on; d extends from -14 to 20.15   
8:232:18592:21:52:108:510:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Given this structure for the data, the econometric model we estimate is of the form: 
8:233:18677:52:71:485:488:263:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1: 
8:234:18677:71:8:71:218:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
8:235:18737:8:16:72:512:184:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:12 Possibly due to the occurrence of payments from transfer programs like Supplemental Security Income and 
8:236:18844:16:7:72:358:168:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:food stamps, and many bills falling due on or near the 1st of the month. 
8:237:18917:7:16:72:509:161:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:13 For example, January 3, 1995 is a Tuesday, so the first synthetic month of the year is December 20th of the 
8:238:19028:16:7:71:503:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:previous year through to January 19, 1995; month two is then January 20th though February 20th, and so on. 
8:239:19135:7:16:72:504:138:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:14 When February 3rd falls on a weekday, the second synthetic month of the year will only contain 28 days.  
8:240:19243:16:11:72:505:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:When the 3rd of the month falls on a Sunday in a month with 31 days, as it does in July 1994, the checks are 
8:241:19352:11:7:72:512:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:distributed on July 1st and the month spans from June 17th to July 19th, making the synthetic month 33 days.    
8:242:19464:7:16:72:520:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:15 Years also follow this structure, so when both the January and December payments are made on the 3rd of the 
8:243:19575:16:0:71:505:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:month, the year will begin on December 20th and will go through until December 16th of the following year.

9:271:20176:20:21:72:497:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f4:equals one if the day is eight to 14 days before the start of the calendar month; Week(-1) 
9:272:20267:21:21:72:522:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f4:equals one if the day is one to seven days before the start of the month; Week(1) and Week(2) 
9:273:20361:21:20:72:486:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:equal one for the 1st to 7th and 8th to 14th days in the calendar month, respectively; and 
9:274:20452:20:21:72:521:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f1:Week(5) is all the extra days before the 14th day prior to the start of the next calendar month.

9:276:20646:21:21:72:512:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:error term.  In this equation, the reference period for the Payweek dummies is PayWeek(-1) 
9:277:20736:21:20:72:511:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and for Week dummies is Week(-1), while the reference weekday is Saturday.  We estimate 
9:278:20824:20:21:72:498:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:standard errors allowing for arbitrary correlation within the days of the synthetic month. 
9:279:20915:21:21:108:482:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The results for equation (1) for decedents 65 and older from 1973 to 1996 are 
9:280:20993:21:20:72:509:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reported in the first column of Table 1.  In the first four rows of the table, we report results 
9:281:21090:20:21:72:510:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for the calendar weeks in relation to the 1st of the month.  The results demonstrate a within-
9:282:21184:21:21:72:475:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month mortality cycle, with deaths declining the week before the 1st and then rising 
9:283:21269:21:20:71:510:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:afterwards.  Daily death rates are about three-tenths of a percent higher in the first week of 
9:284:21364:20:21:72:492:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the month compared to the previous seven days, with a p-value for the test that the null 
9:285:21453:21:21:72:498:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:hypothesis is zero of less than 0.05.  In the next four rows, we show that Social Security 
9:286:21544:21:20:72:498:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:payments have an effect of similar magnitude.  Deaths are about five-tenths of a percent 
9:287:21633:20:21:72:479:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher in the seven days after check receipt compared to the preceding seven days.18 
9:288:21717:21:21:108:517:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In column (2), we consider results for seniors aged 65 to 69.  We focus on this group 
9:289:21803:21:21:72:494:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for two reasons.  First, as we outline below, the sample used to examine the new Social 
9:290:21891:21:17:72:466:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Security payment schedule will only include those aged 65 to 69, so this will be a 
9:291:21974:17:8:72:218:215:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
9:292:22034:8:16:72:503:207:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:16 We include unique dummies for a list of reoccurring special days: January 1st and 2nd, the Friday through 
9:293:22143:16:11:72:516:191:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Monday associated with federal holidays occurring on Mondays (Presidents’ Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
9:294:22249:11:12:72:520:180:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:since 1986, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day), Super Bowl Sunday and the Monday afterwards, Holy 
9:295:22351:12:11:72:499:168:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Thursday through Easter Sunday, July 4th, Veteran’s Day, the Monday through Sunday of Thanksgiving, a 
9:296:22453:11:12:72:503:157:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:dummy for all days from the day after Thanksgiving though New Year’s Eve, plus single-day dummies for 
9:297:22555:12:7:72:229:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:December 24th through December 31st. 
9:298:22592:7:16:72:518:138:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:17 We have estimated all models with synthetic month-year effects, μm, instead of separate synthetic month and 
9:299:22703:16:11:72:475:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:year effects.  Results with this alterative specification are virtually identical to results from the more 
9:300:22810:11:7:72:185:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:parsimonious specification. 
9:301:22838:7:16:72:496:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:18 To provide a frame of reference, Stephens (2003) shows that the probability of any spending among all 
9:302:22943:16:0:72:483:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:seniors is 1.6 percent higher in the first week after checks arrive compared to the previous seven days. 
10:303:23051:0:20:72:500:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:comparable group.  Second, Evans and Moore (2009) demonstrate that the within-month 
10:304:23135:20:21:72:500:688:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mortality cycle – similar in scope to the effect we analyze here – is more pronounced for 
10:305:23225:21:21:72:498:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:younger groups, so we will benefit from focusing on a younger group of Social Security 
10:306:23312:21:20:72:503:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recipients here.  In line with this, we find income receipt has a greater absolute impact on 
10:307:23405:20:21:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f4:mortality on this younger group than on seniors as whole, with the coefficient on Payweek(1) 
10:308:23498:21:21:72:275:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increasing to three-quarters of a percent.   
10:309:23543:21:20:108:523:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There is also a set of decedents in this age group who should NOT be impacted by the 
10:310:23628:20:21:72:487:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“3rd of the month” schedule, which allows us to see whether our results are spuriously 
10:311:23715:21:21:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:correlated with some other effect.  Starting in May of 1997, the timing of monthly payments 
10:312:23807:21:21:72:511:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for new recipients depended on their birth dates.  Those with a birth date from the 1st to the 
10:313:23902:21:20:72:515:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10th are now paid on the second Wednesday of each month; those with a birth date from the 
10:314:23992:20:21:72:512:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:11th to the 20th are paid on the third Wednesday; and those with a birth date from the 21st to 
10:315:24087:21:21:71:509:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the 31st are paid on the fourth Wednesday.  Those already receiving payments on the 3rd of 
10:316:24178:21:20:71:510:439:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the month continued to receive checks as they had before.19  As a falsification exercise, we 
10:317:24271:20:21:72:510:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimate the “3rd of the month” model on decedents who are on the new payment schedule. 
10:318:24359:21:21:108:482:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The sample we construct for this test uses deaths among 65 to 69 year olds as 
10:319:24437:21:20:72:509:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recorded in the MCOD files for 2005 and 2006, the most recent year data is available.  We 
10:320:24527:20:21:72:520:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identified decedents on the new payment schedule using the period-cohort diagram shown as 
10:321:24617:21:21:72:518:336:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Figure 2.  The vertical axis represents year-of-birth cohorts and the horizontal axis identifies 
10:322:24714:21:20:72:499:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the calendar year, so data elements represent a cohort’s age in a particular year.  Eligible 
10:323:24807:20:21:72:517:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:beneficiaries can begin claiming benefits at age 62, and are represented by the shaded boxes 
10:324:24900:21:21:72:503:274:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the table.  Song and Manchester (2007) find that nearly 100 percent of the 1937 cohort 
10:325:24990:21:21:71:507:253:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enrolled by age 65, so everyone below the solid line is most likely claiming benefits.  Age 
10:326:25082:21:20:71:520:232:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:groups in the darkest grey all turned 65 prior to May of 1997, so this group is claiming under 
10:327:25177:20:21:71:519:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the old system.  The medium gray color represents people who could have enrolled in Social 
10:328:25268:21:21:71:518:191:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Security under either system.  The lightest gray group all turned 62 after 1997, and therefore 
10:329:25363:21:20:71:518:170:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are all claiming under the new system.  To ensure we have a sample of decedents paid under 
10:330:25454:20:21:71:506:150:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the new system, we use those aged 65 to 69 who died in the 2005 and 2006 calendar year, 
10:331:25542:21:29:71:511:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which are the groups outlined by the dotted connected lines on the right side of the graph.

11:336:25922:21:21:71:520:667:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:not due to small sample sizes, for in column (4) we report results for the old payment system 
11:337:26016:21:20:71:509:646:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:using only two years worth of data (1995-1996) for the same 65 to 69 age range and find a 
11:338:26106:20:21:71:468:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:statistically significant two percent increase in daily mortality during Payweek(1). 
11:339:26190:21:21:107:504:605:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Next, we consider whether people receiving Social Security checks under the new 
11:340:26270:21:20:71:515:584:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(post-May 1997) system display a spike in mortality after they are paid.  Based on Figure 2, 
11:341:26363:20:21:71:519:564:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we again using data for 65 to 69 year olds in 2005 and 2006.  The restricted-use MCOD data 
11:342:26454:21:21:71:520:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identifies the decedent’s exact date of birth, which allows us to place them into three groups: 
11:343:26550:21:21:71:485:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:birth dates from the 1st to the 10th of the month (paid on the second Wednesday of the 
11:344:26637:21:20:72:519:501:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:month); birth dates from the 11th to the 20th (paid on the third Wednesday); and from the 21st 
11:345:26731:20:21:71:502:481:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to the 31st (fourth Wednesday).  For this sample, we allow the dependent variable to vary 
11:346:26821:21:53:72:459:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:across days, months, years and groups (k), and estimate an equation of the form: 
11:347:26902:53:55:531:534:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
11:348:26902:55:20:72:519:352:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The variables Week(w), Special(j), Weekday, μ, ν, and ε are defined as before.  In this model, 
11:349:26996:20:21:71:511:332:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we add effects for the birthday-based groups, and the variable Payweek(w) is now centered 
11:350:27086:21:21:71:514:311:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on the second, third, or fourth Wednesday of the month, depending on the group.  Synthetic 
11:351:27177:21:21:71:515:290:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:months are uniquely defined for each birth date group (k).  Because pay dates are now fixed 
11:352:27269:21:20:71:494:269:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:on Wednesdays, there are either 28 or 35 days in the synthetic months.  If the receipt of 
11:353:27359:20:21:71:508:249:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:income alters short-term mortality, then the mortality cycle patterns should have shifted to 
11:354:27452:21:21:71:490:228:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:different parts of the month for Social Security beneficiaries enrolling after May 1997. 
11:355:27541:21:20:107:516:207:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Results from equation (2) for 65 to 69 year olds in 2005 and 2006 are reported in the 
11:356:27627:20:21:71:481:187:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:first column of Table 2.  There is a pronounced within-month mortality cycle, with a 
11:357:27712:21:21:71:512:166:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:statistically significant 1.4 percent value on the Week(1) variable.  There is also a large pay 
11:358:27808:21:20:71:447:145:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect: the coefficient on Payweek(1) is a statistically significant 1.1 percent.   
11:359:27892:20:21:107:511:125:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A shortcoming of this test is that not all recipients are paid based on their own birth

12:385:28312:20:21:72:503:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:measurement error across the three birth date groups – some people in each group are not 
12:386:28401:21:21:72:494:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:being treated on the same schedule.  Nevertheless, people who never married should be 
12:387:28487:21:20:72:509:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:claiming benefits under their own birth date, so we report results for never-married seniors 
12:388:28580:20:21:72:513:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:aged 65 to 69 in the 2005 and 2006 MCOD files in column (2) of Table 2.  There is a much 
12:389:28669:21:21:72:520:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:larger increase in the payday effect on mortality.  The coefficient on Payweek(1) is now 2.75 
12:390:28763:21:20:72:500:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:percent, although it is a much smaller group and so the z-score is only 1.56, meaning the 
12:391:28853:20:21:72:364:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:results are statistically significant at a p-value of about 0.12. 
12:392:28919:21:21:108:515:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The final two columns of the table contain the results of two placebo tests.  First, we 
12:393:29007:21:21:72:525:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:re-estimate the model from equation (2) by imposing the new payment schedule on decedents 
12:394:29097:21:20:72:496:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:aged 65 to 69 in 1995 and 1996, who would have been on the old payment system.  The 
12:395:29181:20:21:72:498:481:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f1:Payweek(1) variable should be small and statistically insignificant in this case, and it is.  
12:396:29275:21:21:72:515:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Second, we estimate the same model for decedents aged 50 to 59 in 2005 and 2006, a group 
12:397:29364:21:20:72:499:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:not enrolled in Social Security.  As expected, we find no impact on Payweek(1).  In both 
12:398:29453:20:21:72:503:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:columns (3) and (4), we document large and statistically significant within-month cycles. 
12:399:29543:21:21:108:488:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:As we noted above, the work linking mortality to income payments has to date 
12:400:29620:21:20:72:489:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:primarily focused on the impact on substance abuse related deaths.  In this section, we 
12:401:29708:20:21:72:521:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:estimate models for causes both related and unrelated to substance abuse.  Causes of death in 
12:402:29802:21:21:72:510:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the MCOD files are defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes.  
12:403:29893:21:20:72:521:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Three different ICD versions are used during the period we consider: ICD-8 (1973-8), ICD-9 
12:404:29984:20:21:72:521:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(1979-98), and ICD-10 (1999-2006).  The codes used to identify substance abuse vary across 
12:405:30075:21:21:72:511:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:versions, so for the “3rd of the month” analysis we use ICD-9 data from 1979 to 1996.  The 
12:406:30166:21:21:72:505:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:primary aim of this analysis is to see whether the increase in deaths is solely explained by 
12:407:30259:21:20:72:488:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:substance abuse, so we err on the side of defining too many deaths as substance abuse-
12:408:30345:20:21:72:503:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:related, rather than too few.  Each death has an underlying cause as well as up to 19 other 
12:409:30437:21:21:72:517:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:causes, and we define a substance abuse death as one in which any of the causes has an ICD-
12:410:30528:21:20:72:516:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:9 code associated with substance abuse.  The list of causes defined as substance abuse is the 
12:411:30622:20:21:72:519:150:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:same list used by Phillips et al. (1999), and the causes used by studies on the economic costs 
12:412:30717:21:0:71:523:129:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of substance abuse in the United States (Harwood, Fountain, and Livermore, 1998), Australia 
13:413:30813:0:20:72:515:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(Collins and Lapsley, 2002), and Canada (Single et al., 1999).20  We classify approximately 
13:414:30905:20:21:72:457:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:one percent of deaths among seniors in 1979 to 1996 as substance abuse deaths. 
13:415:30984:21:21:108:495:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Column (1) of Table 3 contains estimates for equation (1) for all causes of death 
13:416:31066:21:20:72:517:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:among seniors during the ICD-9 reporting period of 1979-1996.  These results are similar to 
13:417:31158:20:21:72:523:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:those in Table 1.  We report results for substance abuse in column (2), and find a pronounced 
13:418:31252:21:21:72:524:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:within-month mortality cycle – the Week(1) coefficient is 1.90 percent, with a p-value of only 
13:419:31347:21:20:72:517:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:0.11.  There is also a large coefficient (standard error) on the Payweek(1) variable of 0.0367 
13:420:31442:20:21:72:517:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(0.0112).  In column (3) we re-estimate the model using non-substance abuse deaths.  These 
13:421:31533:21:21:72:516:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths represent 99 percent of all deaths from column (1), so it is no surprise that the results 
13:422:31630:21:21:72:501:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:in columns (1) and (3) are virtually identical.  The results in columns (2) and (3) indicate 
13:423:31723:21:20:72:495:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:that, compared to the week prior to payday, there are about 117 excess substance-abuse 
13:424:31810:20:21:72:518:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:related deaths each year compared to 1,236 excess deaths from non-substance abuse causes.  
13:425:31901:21:21:72:500:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Even with some under-reporting of substance abuse causes, these results suggest that the 
13:426:31990:21:20:72:524:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:effect of income on mortality extends well beyond substance abuse, and in fact that substance 
13:427:32084:20:21:72:400:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:abuse deaths are responsible for a minority of the aggregate pattern. 
13:428:32154:21:21:108:510:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In the final three columns of Table 3, we use both ICD-8 and ICD-9 to create a few 
13:429:32237:21:20:72:504:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:broad underlying cause-of-death categories.  For each cause, we estimate equation (1) for 
13:430:32327:20:21:72:513:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:decedents 65 and older for the entire 1973-1996 period.21  In column (4), we present results 
13:431:32420:21:21:72:510:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:for external causes of death (e.g., accidents, murders, suicides, motor vehicle crashes), and 
13:432:32514:21:20:72:506:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:find both a large within-month effect (coefficient and standard error on Week(1) is 0.0257 
13:433:32605:20:21:72:524:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(0.0059)) and a large pay week effect (coefficient and standard error on Payweek(1) is 0.0410 
13:434:32699:21:21:72:521:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(0.0057)).  In column (5), we present results for heart attacks, a cause often associated with a 
13:435:32796:21:21:72:522:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:short time from onset to death.  The pay week coefficients are slightly larger for heart attacks 
13:436:32893:21:20:72:512:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:than for all deaths (as reported in column (1) of Table 1).  Finally, in column (6), we report 
13:437:32988:20:21:72:520:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:results for cancer – a cause of death we can view as a placebo test, because cancer deaths are 
13:438:33083:21:21:72:516:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:far less affected by activity levels than most other causes.  We do not find either a pay week

13:442:33426:12:16:72:514:127:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:21 The NCHS recoded ICD-8 and ICD-9 deaths into 34 underlying causes.  Our external causes group consists 
13:443:33532:16:12:72:514:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:of deaths with codes 33 to 36.  Heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions) have an underlying cause of death

14:447:33865:13:21:72:274:695:144:Times:144:Times:1b. The Military Payment Schedule 
14:448:33899:21:21:108:512:674:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Military personnel are paid on the 1st and the 15th of each month, or on the previous 
14:449:33985:21:20:72:505:653:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:business day when these dates fall on a weekend or a public holiday.22  In this section, we 
14:450:34077:20:21:72:486:633:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:examine whether mortality spikes on or immediately after these dates.  Parker (1999), 
14:451:34163:21:21:72:503:612:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Stephens (2006), and Browning and Collado (2001) use the receipt of earnings to test the 
14:452:34252:21:21:72:516:591:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:LC/PIH, with the first two studies finding consumption was excessively sensitive to income 
14:453:34343:21:20:72:508:570:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:receipt.  In this section, we compare mortality patterns in counties with and without a high 
14:454:34436:20:21:72:333:550:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:proportion of their population on active military duty. 
14:455:34492:21:21:108:460:529:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Military personnel are predominantly male (currently 85 percent), young 
14:456:34564:21:20:72:500:508:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(approximately one half are under 25 years of age) and healthy (Segal and Segal, 2004).  
14:457:34653:20:21:72:521:488:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Between 1973 and 1990 there were anywhere from 2.04 to 2.25 million military personnel in 
14:458:34743:21:21:72:490:467:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the US, before falling to 1.38 million in 2001 and then increasing slightly thereafter.23  
14:459:34834:21:20:72:512:446:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Soldiers normally reside on or near the base to which they are attached, and these bases are 
14:460:34927:20:21:72:502:426:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:unevenly distributed throughout the country.  Since both the size of the military and base 
14:461:35018:21:21:72:514:405:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:locations were fairly uniform over the 1973 to 1988 period, and the public-use MCOD files 
14:462:35108:21:21:72:503:384:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:contain exact dates of death during this time, we focus on that time period in this section. 
14:463:35201:21:20:108:469:363:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:We generate a military working-age sample of 17 to 64 year olds.24  Using 
14:464:35275:20:21:72:522:343:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:information from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Census Summary File 3 data sets,25 we identified 
14:465:35366:21:21:72:494:322:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:counties with more than 15 percent of their population aged 17 to 64 who were military 
14:466:35453:21:20:72:523:301:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:personnel in all three Censuses.26  There are 21 counties that meet this criterion27 and in 1990 
14:467:35550:20:21:72:512:281:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and there were roughly 326,000 people aged 17 to 64 in these “military” counties, of which 
14:468:35640:21:42:72:524:260:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:about one quarter were in the military.  Military personnel have a large number of dependents

14:470:35794:7:16:72:492:211:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:22 We can date this policy as early as 1971, https://www.usna.com/SSLPage.aspx?pid=6121 but no older 
14:471:35895:16:7:72:519:195:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:veteran or military expert we spoke with could remember a time when wages were not paid on these two dates. 
14:472:36003:7:12:72:442:188:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:23 Authors’ calculations from various issues of the Statistical Abstract of the United States.   
14:473:36100:12:13:72:494:176:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:24 Enlistment in the military can occur at age 17 years with parental consent, and at age 18 years without. 
14:474:36208:13:13:72:414:163:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:25 These data are taken from the National Historical Geographic Information System. 
14:475:36292:13:16:72:517:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:26 Counties that changed boundaries between 1970 and 1990 were merged prior to this exercise (changes are at 
14:476:36401:16:12:72:498:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:http://wonder.cdc.gov/WONDER/help/Census1970-2000.HTML).  There were many changes to Alaska’s 
14:477:36495:12:7:72:513:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:county-equivalent geographic boundaries over this period, so we did not use Alaskan deaths in this analysis.   
14:478:36606:7:16:72:513:115:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:27 The States (Counties) in our sample are: AL (Dale), GA(Chattahoochee, Liberty), ID (Elmore), KS (Geary, 
14:479:36713:16:11:72:499:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Riley), KY (Christian, Hardin), LA (Vernon), MO (Pulaski), NE (Sarpy), NC (Cumberland, Onslow), OK

15:481:36920:0:20:72:516:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and bases typically employ many civilians paid on the same schedule,28 so the proportion of 
15:482:37012:20:21:72:524:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the population who would have been affected by the military payment schedule in these areas 
15:483:37104:21:21:72:523:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:will be much higher than 25 percent.  We compare the mortality patterns for people from this 
15:484:37197:21:20:72:504:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:group of counties with a comparison sample of people from 2,772 “nonmilitary” counties 
15:485:37284:20:21:72:509:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:that have less than one percent military among adults aged 17 to 64 in the same censuses.   
15:486:37376:21:21:107:516:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:While the widespread nature of the within-month mortality cycle may mean military 
15:487:37458:21:20:71:508:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and non-military counties exhibit a similar time series in mortality counts around the 1st of 
15:488:37552:20:21:72:514:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the month, we expect a much greater frequency of paycheck distributions around the 15th in 
15:489:37643:21:21:72:491:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:military counties compared to non-military counties because the predominant payment 
15:490:37727:21:21:72:338:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:frequency outside the military is weekly or biweekly.29 
15:491:37782:21:20:108:507:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In Figure 3, we use data from the 1973-1988 MCOD to construct the relative daily 
15:492:37863:20:21:72:494:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality risk for our sample for the seven days before and after military paychecks are 
15:493:37952:21:21:72:524:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:distributed. The solid line in the graph represents the daily mortality risk for military counties 
15:494:38051:21:20:72:515:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and the dotted line is for non-military counties.  The vertical lines from each point represent 
15:495:38147:20:21:72:370:419:145:g_d0_f1:144:Times:the 95 percent confidence interval for the daily mortality risk. 
15:496:38211:21:21:108:522:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The two groups show similar pattern around the first payday of the month.  There is a 
15:497:38297:21:20:72:481:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:within-month mortality cycle for both military and nonmilitary counties, with deaths 
15:498:38382:20:21:72:515:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:declining before checks arrive and rebounding afterwards (perhaps accentuated by weekend 
15:499:38471:21:21:72:514:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:days disproportionately coming after payments).  The day after military paychecks arrive is 
15:500:38563:21:20:72:511:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the peak mortality day for both groups in this two-week cycle. Compared to the day before 
15:501:38653:20:21:72:494:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:payment (Payday -1), deaths the day after payment (Payday 2) are 9.3 percent higher in 
15:502:38740:21:21:72:522:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:military counties and 6.4 percent higher in nonmilitary counties.  For all days throughout this 
15:503:38836:21:21:72:508:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:two-week period we cannot reject the null that both groups have the same mortality risks.  
15:504:38927:21:20:108:521:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The pattern is more pronounced for military counties around the arrival of the second 
15:505:39013:20:21:72:507:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:paycheck.  The day prior to the second wage payment, there is a drop in daily mortality of 
15:506:39104:21:21:72:485:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:5.6 percent in the military counties compared with 2 percent in nonmilitary counties.  
15:507:39191:21:20:72:498:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Likewise, mortality is 9.6 percent higher in military counties on the day after the second 
15:508:39282:20:15:72:496:150:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:paycheck of the month arrives while the comparison counties show a 1.8 percent excess 
15:509:39368:15:8:72:218:135:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
15:510:39428:8:16:72:499:127:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:28 Data from various issues of the Statistical Abstract of the United States indicate that during our analysis 
15:511:39539:16:7:72:382:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:period, about one million civilians were employed annually by the military.   
15:512:39617:7:16:72:511:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:29 Data from the 1996-2004 Diary Survey Record of the CEX indicate that only 9.6 percent of workers report 
15:513:39724:16:0:72:472:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:their last pay check as being paid monthly, while only 5.5 percent report being paid twice-monthly. 
16:514:39828:0:20:72:517:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality on this day.  For the day after the second paycheck is distributed, we can reject the 
16:515:39924:20:21:71:527:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:null hypothesis that the mortality rates are the same on the military and nonmilitary counties.   
16:516:40022:21:21:107:520:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:To formally test whether military and nonmilitary counties exhibit different mortality 
16:517:40109:21:20:71:518:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:patterns around the 1st and 15th of the month, we estimate a model similar to equation (1).  A 
16:518:40204:20:21:72:505:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:key difference is that we use a negative binomial model that allows for integer values and 
16:519:40295:21:21:72:494:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:estimate it by maximum likelihood (Hausman, Hall and Griliches, 1984), because daily 
16:520:40380:21:20:72:514:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality counts in the military counties are small and occasionally zero.  Let Yidmy be daily 
16:521:40475:20:21:72:508:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality counts for group i (for military and nonmilitary counties) on day d, month m and 
16:522:40566:21:21:72:518:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:year y.  Let Xidmy be vector that captures the exogenous variables in equation (1).  Within the 
16:523:40662:21:21:71:490:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:negative binomial model, E[Yidmy | Xidmy ] = δexp(Xidmy β), where δ is a parameter that 
16:524:40749:21:20:72:507:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:captures whether the data exhibits over-dispersion.30  By definition, ∂ln E[Yidmy | Xidmy ]/∂ 
16:525:40842:20:21:72:513:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Xidmy = β so the parameters in this model are interpreted similarly to those in equation (1).   
16:526:40938:21:21:107:507:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In constructing the data set, the “synthetic” months are 28-day periods that include 
16:527:41023:21:20:72:522:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the seven days before and after the two military checks are distributed each month, and begin 
16:528:41117:20:21:72:518:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:seven days before the first payment each month.31   When the 1st or the 15th of the month are 
16:529:41211:21:21:72:483:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:on a weekend or a public holiday, wages are paid on the closest prior working day.32  
16:530:41297:21:174:108:386:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The exact specification for equation Xidmyβ is of the form: 
16:531:41356:174:7:72:218:203:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:                                                            
16:532:41416:7:16:72:509:196:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:30 It can be demonstrated that the variance of counts in the negative binomial model is Var[Yidmy | Xidmy ]= δ2 
16:533:41527:16:12:72:516:180:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:[1+(1/δ)]exp(Xidmy β), so the variance to mean ratio in this model is δ +1.  When δ>0 the variance grows faster 
16:534:41638:12:11:72:514:168:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:than the mean and the data exhibit over-dispersion and when δ=0 the negative binomial collapses to a Poisson 
16:535:41747:11:7:72:357:157:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:model which by construction restricts the variance to equal the mean.   
16:536:41819:7:16:72:522:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:31 Days outside of the 28-day pay periods are dropped from the analysis.  The two pay periods in each month do 
16:537:41930:16:12:72:501:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:not overlap, except when Presidents Day falls on the 15th of February and the seven days after the previous 
16:538:42038:12:11:72:521:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:wage payment overlaps with the seven days before this payment.  The 28 days around these two payments (25th 
16:539:42145:11:7:72:365:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:January–18th February) is removed when this happens in 1982 and 1988. 
16:540:42215:7:16:72:513:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:32 The relevant public holidays that alter payments in this section are New Year’s Day, Presidents Day, Labor

17:595:42957:21:20:71:523:502:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:two variables. The variables Payday are a series of 13 dummy variables defined for the seven

17:597:43137:21:21:71:518:461:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:before checks are distributed.  We add Nonmilitary and Period2 dummies, and estimate four 
17:598:43227:21:20:71:501:440:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:vectors of coefficients on the payday variables: one for military and nonmilitary counties 
17:599:43318:20:21:71:512:420:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:around the first pay period of the month (β1md and β1nd, respectively) then similar values for

17:601:43506:21:21:72:486:378:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:across the two groups by testing the null hypothesis Ho: βjnd = βjmd for all Payday(d).

17:603:43675:20:21:71:506:337:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Table 4.  Columns (1) and (2) present the coefficients on the payday dummies for the first 
17:604:43766:21:21:71:514:316:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:pay period, for military counties and non-military counties respectively. Column (3) reports 
17:605:43859:21:20:71:519:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the p-value on the -2 log-likelihood test statistic for the null hypothesis that military and non-
17:606:43957:20:21:71:510:275:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:military coefficients for a particular day are equal. The final three columns repeat the same 
17:607:44051:21:21:71:500:254:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:set of results for the second payday near the 15th of the month.  Standard errors allow for

17:609:44227:20:21:108:505:213:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The results in Table 4 correspond with the visual evidence in Figure 3.  In the first 
17:610:44313:21:21:72:504:192:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:pay period, deaths are lowest in both sets of counties the day before paychecks arrive and 
17:611:44404:21:20:72:514:171:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:highest the day after paychecks arrive, with deaths increasing by a statistically insignificant 
17:612:44500:20:21:72:491:151:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:4.7 percent in military counties and a statistically significant 2.1 percent in nonmilitary 
17:613:44592:21:21:72:503:130:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:counties.  The difference between the two sets of counties is not statistically significant.   
17:614:44687:21:21:108:492:109:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The differences are clearer in the second pay period.  There is a large decline in 
17:615:44770:21:0:72:510:88:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality the day before the mid-month check arrives in military counties, as evidenced by 
18:616:44865:0:20:72:507:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the large positive coefficients before and after Payday(-1).  Mortality is 6.3 percent higher 
18:617:44959:20:21:72:500:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the day checks arrive compared to the day before (p-value of 0.085).  The corresponding 
18:618:45047:21:21:71:516:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:numbers for Payday(2) and Payday(3) are 11.8 percent (p-value < 0.001) and 5.6 percent (p-

18:620:45233:20:21:71:506:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:same three dummy variables are smaller than four-tenths of a percent.  For Payday(1) and 
18:621:45322:21:21:71:507:605:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f1:Payday(2), we can reject the null at the 0.05 level that the coefficients are the same across 
18:622:45416:21:20:71:501:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:military and nonmilitary counties, while the p-value for this test on Payday(3) is 0.11.33   
18:623:45509:20:21:108:495:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:As in the previous section, we identify deaths related and unrelated to substance 
18:624:45591:21:21:72:507:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:abuse using the same ICD-9 codes.  Between 1979 and 1988, approximately 10 percent of 
18:625:45677:21:21:72:502:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths among those aged 17 to 64 are defined as substance abuse deaths.  There were 9.9 
18:626:45765:21:20:72:507:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths per day in military counties during this period, with 8.8 deaths per day unrelated to 
18:627:45858:20:21:72:488:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:substance abuse.  In a negative binomial model of the non-substance abuse deaths, the 
18:628:45944:21:21:72:520:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:coefficients (standard errors) on Payday(1) through Payday(3) for the paycheck near the 15th 
18:629:46036:21:20:72:520:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of the month for military counties are 0.0537 (0.0441), 0.0818 (0.0437) and 0.0675 (0.0433), 
18:630:46129:20:21:72:520:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:respectively.  The t-ratios for Payday(2) and (3) are 1.87 and 1.54 respectively. The same set 
18:631:46224:21:21:72:517:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of coefficients for non-military counties are   -0.0055 (0.0044), 0.0045 (0.0044), and 0.0013 
18:632:46318:21:20:72:490:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(00047), and the p-values on the tests that the daily effects are the same across the two 
18:633:46408:20:21:72:513:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:groups for the three days are 0.18, 0.08, and 0.13.  While we still see large increases in non-
18:634:46503:21:21:72:515:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:substance abuse deaths, the accuracy of each estimate has decreased and the test identifying 
18:635:46596:21:21:72:275:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:differences across groups are imprecise.34

18:638:46700:7:16:72:520:242:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:33 The results move in the expected direction as we change the criteria for what constitutes a military county.  If 
18:639:46816:16:12:71:517:226:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:we only include as treated counties as those where the fraction of adults aged 17 to 64 must exceed 20 percent, 
18:640:46928:12:11:71:484:214:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:average daily mortality falls to about 7 which should increase standard errors (because we increase the 
18:641:47032:11:12:71:519:203:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:variability of daily deaths) but the coefficients should increase (as the counties have a higher fraction of treated 
18:642:47149:12:11:71:498:191:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:people).  This is close to what we find.  The coefficients (standard errors) [p values on test of equality] for

18:646:47590:12:11:71:484:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:errors should fall as the day to day variance in death rates declines but coefficients also decrease as the 
18:647:47698:11:12:71:507:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:impacted fraction of the population falls.  This is exactly what we find.  The coefficients (standard errors) [p

18:650:48010:7:16:72:522:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:34 Given the smaller sample size and the small number of deaths per day for substance abuse deaths, none of the 
18:651:48122:16:0:72:353:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:coefficients on the Payday(d) variables were statistically significant.

19:655:48447:21:20:72:515:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:us to determine whether the increases merely represent “short-term mortality displacement” 
19:656:48538:20:21:72:514:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:where the deaths of the frail were hastened by a few days, a phenomenon routinely referred 
19:657:48629:21:21:72:507:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:to as “harvesting” (Zeger et al., 1999).   In this section, we use two new events to examine 
19:658:48722:21:20:72:425:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:how much of the short-term mortality increase represents displacement.

19:661:48822:21:21:108:506:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act35 was signed into law on 
19:662:48901:21:20:72:522:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:June 7, 2001 and included a reduction in the tax rate on the lowest income bracket from 15 to 
19:663:48995:20:21:72:514:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:10 percent.  This tax change was applied retroactively for income earned in 2001 and, as an 
19:664:49087:21:21:72:518:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:advance payment on the tax cut, households were sent rebate based on their 2000 tax returns 
19:665:49179:21:20:72:507:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:in the summer and fall of 2001.  Approximately two-thirds of all households in the United 
19:666:49269:20:21:72:520:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:States received a rebate check.  The maximum rebates for single and married taxpayers were 
19:667:49360:21:21:72:497:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:$300 and $600, respectively.  Johnson, Parker, and Souleles (2006) estimate households 
19:668:49447:21:20:72:493:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:received about $500 on average, or about one percent of median annual family income. 
19:669:49532:20:21:108:518:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Rebate checks were mailed over a ten-week period and check distribution dates were 
19:670:49615:21:21:72:521:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:based on the second-to-last digit of the Social Security number (SSN) of the person filing the 
19:671:49710:21:20:72:508:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:taxes.36  The first checks were sent on Monday, July 23, to taxpayers whose second-to-last 
19:672:49801:20:21:71:509:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:SSN digit was a zero.37  Table 6 shows the exact distribution dates of checks by SSN.  The 
19:673:49892:21:21:72:512:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Treasury Department sent letters to taxpayers a few weeks before checks arrived informing 
19:674:49982:21:21:72:447:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:them of the size and date of their check (Johnson, Parker and Souleles, 2006).

19:680:50481:11:16:72:499:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:37 Households who filed their year 2000 tax return late may have been sent their rebates after the ten-week 
19:681:50589:16:12:72:520:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:period shown in Table 7.  According to Slemrod et al. (1997) 92 percent of taxpayers typically file on or before 
19:682:50702:12:11:72:519:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:the normal April 15 deadline, so the vast majority of households would have received their checks according to 
19:683:50813:11:7:72:204:111:100:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:the schedule outlined in Table 7. 
19:684:50847:7:16:72:512:104:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:38 Geographic areas determine the first three digits of Social Security Number, a group determines the middle 
19:685:50957:16:0:72:521:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:two digits, and the last four digits are assigned sequentially, so are effectively random.  The second-to-last digit

20:687:51169:20:21:72:521:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:nondurable goods increased in the months after the arrival of checks.  Using data on SSNs of 
20:688:51262:21:21:72:514:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:credit card holders, Agarwal, Chiu and Souleles (2007) found that households initially used 
20:689:51354:21:20:72:488:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:rebate money to reduce credit card debt, but soon afterward increased their credit card 
20:690:51442:20:21:72:523:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:spending by amounts comparable to the initial payments.  In contrast to these results, Shapiro 
20:691:51537:21:21:71:469:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and Slemrod (2003) found a minority of households planned to spend their rebate. 
20:692:51618:21:20:108:518:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: We use the check distribution schedule to examine the short-run consequences of the 
20:693:51702:20:21:71:478:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:rebates on mortality. For this project, the NCHS merged the second-to-last digit of a 
20:694:51788:21:21:72:522:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:decedent’s SSN from the National Death Index (NDI)39 to the 2000-2002 MCOD data files.   
20:695:51877:21:21:108:512:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The econometric model for this event is straightforward.  Let i =0 to 9 index groups 
20:696:51962:21:20:71:519:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of people based on the second-to-last digit of their SSN.  Let t index one of 30 7-day periods 
20:697:52057:20:21:71:512:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:during the spring through fall of 2001, with the first period beginning on Monday May 14th 
20:698:52147:21:21:72:507:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and the last beginning on December 3rd.  This 30-week period starts ten weeks prior to the 
20:699:52238:21:20:72:512:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:first check being distributed and ends ten weeks after the last check was sent.  Let yit be the 
20:700:52334:20:21:72:511:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths for group i in week t and let REBATE1it be a dummy variable that equals one for the 
20:701:52425:21:25:72:377:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:week group i received a check. The estimating equation is then 
20:702:52488:25:21:262:330:373:49:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:1(4)ln(   )1ititititYREBATE 
20:703:52525:21:20:72:520:352:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:where υi  are fixed week effects, ηj are fixed group effects and εij is a random error term.  The 
20:704:52620:20:21:72:492:332:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:group effects identify persistent differences in weekly mortality counts that vary across 
20:705:52710:21:21:72:521:311:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:groups, but since the second-to-last digit of a SSN is randomly assigned there should be little 
20:706:52806:21:20:72:518:290:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:difference in mortality rates across groups.  The week effects capture the differences that are 
20:707:52902:20:21:72:480:270:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:common to all groups but vary across weeks.  For example, the 9/11 terrorist attacks 
20:708:52987:21:21:72:503:249:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:occurred during Week 18 in our analysis.  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 
20:709:53076:21:20:72:514:228:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:there were 2,902 deaths associated with September 11th, which is roughly twenty percent of 
20:710:53167:20:21:72:520:208:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:weekly deaths during this period.40  There also appears to be a drop in mortality in the weeks 
20:711:53262:21:30:72:497:187:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:just after September 11th as individuals stayed home and reduced their travel.  The week

20:713:53535:12:11:72:516:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:mailing system was in fact chosen because it was felt the random assignation made it a fair way to allocate the 
20:714:53647:11:7:72:257:134:100:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:checks (Johnson, Parker and Souleles, 2006).  
20:715:53693:7:16:72:518:127:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:39 The NDI is an index of death record information designed to assist medical and health researchers who want 
20:716:53803:16:12:72:513:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:to ascertain whether subjects in their studies have died, and includes each decedent’s SSN.  More information 
20:717:53913:12:7:72:310:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:about the NDI can be found at www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm.

21:719:54030:0:20:72:505:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:effects will capture these cyclic changes in mortality so long as the deaths associated with 
21:720:54123:20:21:72:516:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:September 11 are equally distributed across the 10 SSN groups.  The coefficient on β1 is the 
21:721:54215:21:21:72:497:667:145:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:key variable of interest and it identifies the short-run impact of the rebates on mortality.  
21:722:54309:21:20:108:524:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:There are two caveats to equation (4).  First, only taxpaying units with taxable income 
21:723:54397:20:21:72:520:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:in 2000 received a tax rebate in 2001.  The coefficient on β1 represents a reduced-form effect 
21:724:54492:21:21:72:522:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and not the impact of actually receiving a check.  Therefore, a key to the analysis is to reduce 
21:725:54589:21:20:72:489:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the sample to people likely to have received a tax rebate.  We do this by restricting the 
21:726:54679:20:21:72:490:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:sample to those aged 25 to 64, who are much more likely to have paid taxes than other 
21:727:54765:21:21:72:503:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:groups such as seniors.41  Second, for married couples filing jointly, the rebate check was 
21:728:54857:21:21:71:522:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:sent according to the SSN of the first name on the IRS 1040 form.  This form does not record 
21:729:54950:21:20:71:513:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the sex of the taxpayers so we have no idea whether husband or wives are more likely to be 
21:730:55041:20:21:71:512:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:listed as the first taxpayer.  Although both partners in a marriage are presumably treated by 
21:731:55135:21:21:71:513:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the additional income, the mailing of the check was based on the SSN of only one of them.  
21:732:55226:21:20:71:485:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Since people not sent a check but treated with a rebate through their spouse should be 
21:733:55313:20:21:71:511:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:randomly distributed across the different groups, this should systematically bias our results 
21:734:55407:21:21:71:476:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:towards zero.  Later, we consider models where we reduce the sample to unmarried 
21:735:55488:21:20:71:402:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:taxpayers, a group where we should better identify rebate recipients. 
21:736:55558:20:21:107:506:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The results for equation (4) are reported in Table 6.  The SSN groups experience a 
21:737:55641:21:21:71:520:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:statistically significant 2.7 percent increase in mortality in the week the checks arrive.  There 
21:738:55739:21:20:71:523:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:is a large p-value on the test that all the group fixed effects are zero, adding empirical support 
21:739:55838:20:21:71:519:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:to the assumption that the second-to-last digit of the SSN is randomly assigned.  Overall, the 
21:740:55933:21:21:71:506:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:results suggest a large short-term increase in mortality immediately after income receipt.   
21:741:56026:21:21:107:501:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:While we anticipate there is some autocorrelation in mortality rates, Monte Carlo 
21:742:56108:21:20:71:499:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:estimates suggest that Huber/White-type procedures allowing for arbitrary correlation in 
21:743:56197:20:21:71:507:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:errors perform poorly when the number of groups is small (Wooldridge, 2003).  While we 
21:744:56284:21:21:71:516:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:could employ an AR(1), the residuals from column (1) of Table 6 regressed on a one-period 
21:745:56374:21:35:71:471:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:lag (deleting the first observation in each group) generate an estimate of the AR(1)

21:747:56519:8:16:72:497:127:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:41 The IPUMS-CPS project (King et al., 2004) has attached estimates of taxable income to March Current 
21:748:56622:16:12:72:513:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Population Survey (CPS) data.  Using data from the 2001 March CPS (2000 tax year), their estimates suggest 
21:749:56729:12:11:72:511:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:that 52 percent of people aged 25-64 were in households that paid federal income taxes but this same number 
21:750:56837:11:0:72:253:88:100:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f2:for people aged 65 and older was 26 percent. 
22:751:56886:0:20:72:510:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:coefficient (standard error) of 0.0085 (0.0584), which suggests that autocorrelation is not a 
22:752:56980:20:21:72:332:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:problem in this relatively young group of decedents.   
22:753:57035:21:21:108:505:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In column (2) of Table 6, we add REBATE2, REBATE3, and REBATE4, which are 
22:754:57109:21:20:72:487:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:dummies for the second, third and fourth week after the checks arrive, respectively, to

22:756:57277:21:21:72:505:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:displacement.  If there is significant short-term displacement, then we should find that the 
22:757:57370:21:20:72:522:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:sum of the coefficients in subsequent weeks should be negative and close in magnitude to the 
22:758:57463:20:21:72:516:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:estimate for REBATE1.   Notice that in the third week after the checks arrive there is a large 
22:759:57558:21:21:72:505:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:drop in mortality that is similar in magnitude to the coefficient on REBATE1.  Adding the 
22:760:57648:21:21:72:481:522:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f1:REBATE1 through REBATE3 coefficients in column (2), we get an estimated change 
22:761:57727:21:20:72:524:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:(standard error) in mortality of -0.0151 (0.0194).  In this instance, we cannot reject the null of 
22:762:57826:20:21:72:452:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:no aggregate change in mortality over the first three weeks after checks arrive.

22:765:58086:20:21:72:520:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:abuse, which represents 85 deaths per group per week.42  Column (3) of Table 6 contains the 
22:766:58178:21:21:72:524:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:results for substance abuse deaths, and only the negative coefficient on REBATE4 approaches

22:768:58367:20:21:72:509:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and the results are nearly identical to the results for all deaths in column (2), showing once

23:797:60743:21:20:72:503:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:worth approximately $35.9 billion at the end of the 2008 financial year.46  Since 1982, an

23:799:60918:21:21:72:522:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:investments during the previous five years.  The amount paid has been between $331 in 1984

24:821:62863:20:21:71:491:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:though household consumption is sensitive to income tax refunds – which leads him to 
24:822:62948:21:21:71:514:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:conclude that households adhere to the LC/PIH for large and predictable payments (like the

24:824:63132:20:21:108:516:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The recent years of the Permanent Fund payments provide an opportunity to explore 
24:825:63214:21:21:72:522:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the short-term relationship between income payments and mortality.  Payments were initially 
24:826:63306:21:20:72:517:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:made entirely by check, mailed at a rate of 50,000 per week.  Payment by direct deposit was 
24:827:63398:20:21:72:517:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:introduced in 1993.  Approximately 30 percent of recipients initially received their dividend 
24:828:63492:21:21:72:517:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:this way, which grew to two-thirds of recipients by 2001 and three-quarters by 2006.  Direct 
24:829:63585:21:21:72:520:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deposits are made on only one or two dates, and since at least 2000, over 90 percent of paper 
24:830:63679:21:20:72:513:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:checks have been processed and mailed in a single batch shortly after the payment of direct

24:833:63958:21:20:71:520:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:from 2000 through 2006 to investigate whether dividend payments change mortality patterns 
24:834:64048:20:21:71:521:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:among Alaskans.  We focus on this period because of the popularity of direct deposit and the 
24:835:64141:21:21:71:431:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:close proximity between the receipt of direct deposits and paper checks.48  
24:836:64217:21:20:108:518:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The primary data for this analysis are from the MCOD restricted-use files from 2000

24:838:64387:21:21:72:508:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:counts of deaths for Alaskans and residents of the rest of the United States for periods that

24:843:64822:21:20:72:514:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:after Labor Day, regressing these counts against week-year dummies and dummies for each

24:847:65151:8:16:72:497:161:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:48 Since 1998, the estates of Alaskans who applied for the dividend in March but died prior to its payment 
24:848:65258:16:11:72:512:145:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:around October have received the full amount.  Using this time period therefore also allows us to rule out any 
24:849:65369:11:7:71:427:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:bequest-related “death elasticity” of the sort suggested by Kopczuk and Slemrod (2003). 
24:850:65457:7:16:72:510:127:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:49 Alaska has a disproportionate number of aircraft and fishing accidents (Baker et al., 1992).  Fatalities from 
24:851:65570:16:12:72:513:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:these events can be significant relative to the number of deaths in Alaska in any single week.  To decrease the 
24:852:65681:12:11:72:518:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:variation in weekly deaths, in both the Alaskan and non-Alaskan groups we remove deaths with an Underlying

25:855:65995:20:21:71:496:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:a negative direction two weeks later.  This is consistent with an increase in deaths when 
25:856:66085:21:21:71:496:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:income is paid which largely displaces mortality which would have occurred soon after.

25:860:66441:21:20:71:517:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:intervention.  Let w denote twelve seven-day periods that begin on Tuesdays,50 with the first 
25:861:66535:20:21:72:510:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:period each year beginning fifteen days after Labor Day, the first Monday in September.51  
25:862:66626:21:21:72:524:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Let ln(yswy) be the natural log of the deaths for state s (with s=1 for Alaska or s=0 for all other 
25:863:66726:21:21:71:503:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:states) in week w and year y.  Dividend(1) is a dummy that equals one the first week after 
25:864:66817:21:20:71:500:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:dividend payments are made and zero otherwise, and Alaska is a dummy variable for the 
25:865:66903:20:20:71:279:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:state of interest. The model we estimate is: 
25:866:66948:20:25:440:443:461:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: 
25:867:66948:25:21:71:515:436:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:where νwy is a fixed effect that varies by week w and year y, and εswy is a random error.  The 
25:868:67043:21:20:72:489:415:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f1:Alaska dummy variable controls for persistent differences in mortality counts between 
25:869:67129:20:21:71:501:395:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Alaska and the rest of the United States.  The fixed week/year effects capture differences 
25:870:67220:21:21:71:515:374:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:common to both groups, but which vary over time.  The parameter β1 captures the short-run 
25:871:67310:21:21:72:491:353:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:impact of the dividend payments on mortality.  As in the previous section, we examine 
25:872:67396:21:20:72:506:332:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:whether estimated mortality effects for the week after payments are made are the result of 
25:873:67487:20:21:72:511:312:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:harvesting by including Alaska*Dividend(2) to Alaska*Dividend(4) in subsequent models.

25:877:67830:21:21:72:518:229:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:as well.  The results for the Alaska Permanent Fund tell a story similar to the one told by the 
25:878:67926:21:20:72:521:208:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:results for the 2001 tax rebate.  In column (1), we see a large immediate increase in deaths of

26:891:69024:20:21:72:497:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:live in remote areas, and have limited access to the Internet, banking services, the postal

26:893:69206:21:20:72:519:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:indicated that a much larger fraction of the direct deposit recipients live in the urban areas of 
26:894:69304:20:21:72:485:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Alaska.  In columns (3) and (4) of Table 8, we restrict our attention to residents in the 
26:895:69394:21:21:72:524:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:boroughs that contain Anchorage (260,283 residents in 2000 Census), Fairbanks (30,224) and

26:897:69577:21:20:72:523:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the same comparison group of non-Alaskan residents, as nearly everyone in the United States 
26:898:69669:20:21:72:353:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:lives in a county with a town of more than 10,000 people.  
26:899:69726:21:21:108:488:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In this urban sample, there is a 12 percent increase in mortality the week direct 
26:900:69808:21:20:72:518:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deposit occurs.  The p-value on this statistic is less than 0.10.  As in both column (2) and the 
26:901:69905:20:21:72:502:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:case of the 2001 tax rebates, we see a drop in mortality the third week after dividends are 
26:902:69997:21:21:72:521:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:paid, suggesting a large fraction of these deaths represent short-term mortality displacement.  
26:903:70093:21:20:72:521:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:In this instance, however, the increase in mortality does not appear to be entirely harvesting.  
26:904:70190:20:21:72:510:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The sum of the coefficients over the first three weeks after checks arrive is 0.068, and over

26:906:70366:21:20:107:521:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:As with the previous tests, the results are not due to substance abuse.  Using the same

26:908:70546:21:21:72:506:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:to substance abuse.  The impact of the Permanent Fund payments on non-substance abuse 
26:909:70632:21:21:71:510:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths, reported in columns (5) and (6), is similar to the corresponding values for deaths in

26:911:70823:20:21:72:485:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the p-value for the test that this coefficient is zero is 0.11.  In this case, the sum of the

26:917:71299:16:12:72:508:111:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Information Processing System (FIPS) codes in the state.  The restricted-use MCOD data identifies the FIPS

27:920:71576:0:20:72:189:708:144:Times:144:Times:3.         Discussion         
27:921:71606:20:21:72:522:688:144:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f1: Many authors have demonstrated that consumption increases after individuals receive 
27:922:71691:21:21:72:499:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:an expected infusion of cash.  In this paper, we returned to three tests of the LC/PIH and 
27:923:71782:21:20:72:520:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:developed two others to document the mortality consequences of this excess sensitivity.  We 
27:924:71874:20:21:72:492:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:find that mortality increases after the receipt of income for a wide variety of payments: 
27:925:71964:21:21:72:528:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:transfer payments, paychecks, one-time cash bonuses, and annual residency-based dividends.   
27:926:72057:21:20:108:504:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Changing levels of consumption/activity is the most plausible mechanism through 
27:927:72137:20:21:72:490:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:which income receipt affects mortality.  The findings for particular causes of death are 
27:928:72226:21:21:72:508:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:consistent with this, for both when we observe a relationship – like we do for heart attacks 
27:929:72319:21:21:72:462:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:and traffic accidents – and when we do not, as with the tests using cancer deaths. 
27:930:72402:21:20:108:511:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Two alternative reasons for such a relationship are improbable.  First, the change to 
27:931:72488:20:21:71:506:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the Social Security payment schedule and the structure of the 2001 tax rebates allow us to 
27:932:72579:21:21:71:500:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:rule out within-month or seasonal factors that coincide with income receipt.  Second, the 
27:933:72669:21:20:71:520:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:criteria for receiving these payments should not encourage people to improperly record dates 
27:934:72762:20:21:71:513:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of death for financial gain.  Payments to Social Security beneficiaries cease the month after 
27:935:72856:21:21:71:512:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:death,55 a deceased applicant's Permanent Fund dividends go to their estate, military wages 
27:936:72948:21:20:71:502:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:are already earned and the tax rebates were based on tax returns from the previous year.   
27:937:73039:20:21:108:495:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: Before discussing some implications, it is important to stress that we cannot say 
27:938:73121:21:21:72:472:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:anything about whether people are maximizing their own welfare.  Non-smoothing 
27:939:73200:21:20:72:519:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:consumption behavior is consistent with a number of utility maximization models, including 
27:940:73291:20:21:72:518:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:hyperbolic discounting (Shapiro, 2005).  Moreover, increased mortality does not necessarily 
27:941:73383:21:21:72:515:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:reflect contemporaneous poor health: those whose deaths have been hastened by a few days 
27:942:73472:21:21:72:514:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:may have been in poor health already, and external causes of death are largely unconnected 
27:943:73563:21:20:72:492:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:to short-term variation in a person's health.  At this point it is hard to judge the value of 
27:944:73657:20:21:72:327:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:shifting to smaller, more frequent income payments.  
27:945:73710:21:21:108:514:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: It is also difficult to assess the role of income levels and liquidity constraints, as our 
27:946:73801:21:20:72:510:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:tests use partially-treated populations.  What is striking, however, is that similar results are 
27:947:73898:20:21:72:514:150:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:found across a wide range of demographic groups, with our tests covering seniors, working-
27:948:73988:21:29:72:528:129:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:age taxpayers, predominantly younger military personnel, and all of the residents in one state.

28:951:74178:0:20:108:524:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The percentage changes may seem small: mortality for 65 to 69 year olds increases by 
28:952:74263:20:21:71:514:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:1.1 percent the week after Social Security checks arrived in 2005 and 2006, while mortality 
28:953:74355:21:21:71:517:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:increased by 2.7 percent for those aged 18 to 64 the week the 2001 stimulus checks arrived.  
28:954:74448:21:20:71:470:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Relative to general movements in mortality, however, these results are substantial. 
28:955:74532:20:21:107:507:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Consider a simple analysis for 65 to 69 year olds in 2005 and 2006.  There are 471 
28:956:74615:21:21:71:517:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths per day among this group, so paycheck receipt increases mortality by 36.3 deaths per 
28:957:74707:21:20:71:501:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:week.  In 2005 there were 5,532,900 people aged 65 to 69, so the death rate increased by 
28:958:74796:20:21:71:514:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:7.86E-5 (36.3/5,532,900) the week after paycheck receipt.  To demonstrate the significance 
28:959:74887:21:21:71:516:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of this increase, we select a sample of 15,774 adults aged 65 to 69 using data from the 1987-

28:962:75161:20:21:72:505:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:interview on the natural log of family income, a dummy for gender, a set of race/ethnicity 
28:963:75252:21:21:72:514:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:indicators, three indicators for education, six indictors for marital status, and a complete set 
28:964:75349:21:20:72:524:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:of age and year-of-survey effects.  The coefficient (standard error) on log of family income in 
28:965:75445:20:21:72:502:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:this regression is 0.00297 (0.00151).  Assuming that this represents a causal relationship, 
28:966:75537:21:21:72:515:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:then these results suggest that in order to produce an decrease in the mortality rate by 7.86E-
28:967:75632:21:20:72:509:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:5, incomes in this group would have to increase by 2.65 percent, which is roughly equal to 
28:968:75723:20:21:72:493:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the annual cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security payments over the past decade. 
28:969:75811:21:21:108:518:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Estimates for annual payments in Alaska produce a similar story.  In 2000, there was 
28:970:75896:21:20:72:490:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:an average of 52.4 deaths per week among Alaskans aged over 18 years.  A 12 percent 
28:971:75980:20:21:72:507:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:increase in mortality in one week would result in an extra 6.3 deaths for this group.  In the 
28:972:76074:21:21:72:508:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:2001 American Community Survey, reported median household income was $67,090, and 
28:973:76156:21:21:72:498:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the average household had 2.77 members.  Each applicant received a $1,964 dividend in 
28:974:76242:21:20:72:522:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:2000, which would have increased average family income by 9.7 percent.  Using similar data 
28:975:76333:20:21:72:518:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:from the NHIS/MCOD, the coefficient (standard error) on the log of family income in a one-
28:976:76423:21:21:72:509:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:year mortality regression is -0.00077 (0.00021).  Assuming again that this is represents the 
28:977:76516:21:20:72:492:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:causal impact of income on one-year mortality, a 9.7 percent increase in income would 
28:978:76602:20:27:72:505:150:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:mortality rates by 7.45E-5.  Multiplying this by the 418,815 adults in Alaska in 2000, this

28:980:76754:8:16:72:497:115:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:56 This file provides mortality information for National Health Interview Survey respondents by matching 
28:981:76859:16:11:72:515:99:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:surveys to the National Death Index.  A more detailed description of this data set and the sample can be found 
28:982:76970:11:0:72:189:88:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:in Snyder and Evans (2006). 
29:983:77002:0:20:72:482:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:increase in income is estimated to reduce deaths by 31.2.  Therefore, in this best case 
29:984:77090:20:21:71:500:688:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:scenario of the impact of income on mortality, the short-term increase in mortality of 6.3 
29:985:77181:21:21:71:481:667:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:deaths eliminates 20 percent of the estimated benefits from Permanent Fund income. 
29:986:77264:21:20:107:507:646:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:These results have implications for research on the socioeconomic determinants of 
29:987:77346:20:21:71:486:626:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:health.  As we noted in the introduction, the authors who have attempted to determine 
29:988:77432:21:21:71:525:605:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:whether there is a causal impact of income on health have generated inconsistent results.  The 
29:989:77527:21:20:71:522:584:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:short-term mortality impact of income receipt suggests two things about this literature.  First, 
29:990:77624:20:21:71:503:564:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:authors must distinguish the time period of analysis because the short-term consequences 
29:991:77713:21:21:71:506:543:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:may be very different from the long-term consequences.  Second, the short-term mortality 
29:992:77802:21:21:71:495:522:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:effect of income receipt makes it more difficult to use exogenous variation in income to 
29:993:77891:21:20:71:519:501:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:identify a causal link between income and health.  This increases the size of the sample or of 
29:994:77986:20:21:71:479:481:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:the income shock required to find a statistically precise income/health relationship.   
29:995:78074:21:21:107:496:460:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The results outlined above also suggest a potential mechanism for the pro-cyclic 
29:996:78155:21:20:71:515:439:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:nature of mortality that is outlined in Ruhm (2000).  The estimates in Ruhm and subsequent 
29:997:78246:20:21:71:523:419:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:papers isolate a contemporaneous correlation between mortality and measures of the business 
29:998:78338:21:21:71:491:398:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:cycle; yet to date, little has been offered to explain the pathways producing this result.  
29:999:78430:21:20:71:501:377:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:However, if income rises over the business cycle, then the short-term mortality effects of 
29:1000:78521:20:21:71:333:357:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:income receipt may provide just such an explanation.  
29:1001:78575:21:21:107:504:336:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:There are potential policy consequences flowing from these results.  First, there is 
29:1002:78660:21:20:71:517:315:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:evidence of worse hospital patient outcomes when there are fewer medical professionals per 
29:1003:78751:20:21:71:517:295:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:patient (Kostis et al., 2007).  The heightened mortality associated with income receipt might 
29:1004:78845:21:21:71:515:274:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:suggest that emergency rooms, hospitals, police, and fire departments should adjust staffing 
29:1005:78938:21:21:71:487:253:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:levels in accordance with predictable high- and low-mortality days.  Our search of the 
29:1006:79025:21:20:71:513:232:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Internet has so far not provided any anecdotal evidence that such adjustments already exist. 
29:1007:79118:20:21:107:522:212:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:Finally, we noted in the introduction that some health researchers have suggested that 
29:1008:79205:21:21:71:497:191:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:a way to reduce inequality in health outcomes across socioeconomic groups is to simply 
29:1009:79292:21:20:71:508:170:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:increase income transfers to low income groups.  The results in this paper indicate that the 
29:1010:79385:20:21:71:524:150:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:benefits of such a policy regime shift are far from certain.  There is little evidence to date that 
29:1011:79485:21:21:71:523:129:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:cash transfers increase health.  In contrast, the results in this paper show that, in the short run, 
29:1012:79586:21:0:71:509:108:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:there is a pronounced negative consequence to cash infusions for a wide variety of groups.
