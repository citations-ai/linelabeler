2:32:1649:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:The hedonic model of Rosen (1974) has become a workhorse for valuing the characteristics of differentiated
2:33:1755:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:products despite a number of well-documented econometric problems. For example, Bartik (1987)
2:34:1848:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and Epple (1987) each describe a source of endogeneity in the second stage of Rosen's procedure that
2:35:1948:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:has proven difficult to overcome.  In this paper, we propose a new approach for recovering the marginal
2:36:2051:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:willingness-to-pay function that altogether avoids these endogeneity problems. Applying this estimator
2:37:2153:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:to data on large changes in violent crime rates, we find that marginal willingness-to-pay increases
2:38:2252:14:42:72:405:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:by ten cents with each additional violent crime per 100,000 residents.

3:53:2611:0:46:68:204:696:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:54:2628:46:24:68:542:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Dating back to the work of Court (1939),  Grilliches (1961),  and Lancaster (1966),  hedonic
3:55:2720:24:24:68:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:techniques have been used to estimate the implicit prices associated with the attributes of
3:56:2811:24:23:68:542:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differentiated  products.   Rosen’s  (1974)  seminal  work  proposed  a  theoretical  structure  for
3:57:2911:23:24:68:542:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the hedonic regression and a two-stage procedure for the recovery of marginal willingness-to-
3:58:3004:24:24:68:542:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pay (MWTP) functions of heterogeneous individuals for the characteristics of differentiated
3:59:3095:24:24:68:542:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:products.  Importantly, his two-stage approach allowed for two sources of preference hetero-
3:60:3187:24:24:68:542:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:geneity: individuals’ MWTP functions could differ with (i) their individual attributes and (ii)
3:61:3282:24:24:68:542:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quantity of the product attribute that they consume.  The latter is particularly important
3:62:3376:24:24:68:542:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when considering non-marginal policy changes (i.e., any change that is large enough to alter
3:63:3468:24:24:68:542:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  individual’s  willingness  to  pay  at  the  margin).   The  two-stage  procedure  suggested  by
3:64:3569:24:24:68:542:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rosen (and further developed by subsequent authors) uses variation in implicit prices (ob-
3:65:3659:24:24:68:542:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tained either by employing data from multiple markets or by allowing for non-linearity in the
3:66:3752:24:34:68:355:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hedonic price function) to identify the MWTP function.
3:67:3806:34:24:93:542:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With  Rosen  (1974)  as  a  backdrop,  the  property  value  hedonic  model  has  become  the
3:68:3899:24:24:68:542:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workhorse for valuing local public goods and environmental amenities, despite a number of
3:69:3988:24:24:68:541:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well-known and well-documented econometric problems.1Our concern in this paper is with
3:70:4074:24:24:68:542:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an  important  problem  that  arises  in  the  second  stage  of  Rosen’s  two-step  procedure.   In
3:71:4174:24:23:68:542:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:separate  papers,  Bartik  (1987)  and  Epple  (1987)  describe  a  source  of  endogeneity  that  is
3:72:4275:23:24:68:542:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difficult to overcome using standard exclusion restriction arguments.  Specifically, they note
3:73:4369:24:24:68:542:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  unless  the  hedonic  price  function  is  linear,  the  hedonic  price  of  a  product  attribute
3:74:4473:24:24:68:542:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:varies systematically with the quantity consumed.  The researcher therefore faces a difficult
3:75:4566:24:18:68:542:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:endogeneity  problem  in  the  estimation  of  Rosen’s  second  stage.   Moreover,  because  of  the
3:76:4666:18:16:81:542:120:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:1See Taylor (2003) and Palmquist (2005) for a comprehensive discussion.  Some of these problems arise in
3:77:4770:16:11:68:542:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the first stage of Rosen’s two-step procedure; for example, omitted variables that may be correlated with the
3:78:4879:11:12:68:542:93:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:local attribute of interest.  There is a large and growing literature that describes both quasi-experimental and
3:79:4991:12:0:68:439:81:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:structural solutions to this problem (see Parmeter and Pope (2009) for a discussion).
4:80:5077:0:24:68:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium features of the hedonic model, there are very few natural exclusion restrictions
4:81:5169:24:24:68:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that one can use to solve this endogeneity problem.  In particular, within-market supply-side
4:82:5262:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shifters – the typical instrument of choice when estimating a demand equation – are not valid
4:83:5355:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this context.  This has generally left researchers to choose from a variety of weak instrument
4:84:5452:24:24:68:542:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies or instruments based on cross-market preference homogeneity assumptions that may
4:85:5543:24:24:68:542:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be difficult to justify.  With a few exceptions, the hedonics literature has subsequently ignored
4:86:5640:24:24:68:542:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rosen’s second stage, focusing instead on recovering estimates of the hedonic price function
4:87:5732:24:34:68:326:529:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:and valuing only marginal changes in amenities.2,3
4:88:5782:34:24:93:542:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we propose an estimation procedure for the recovery of the structural pa-
4:89:5870:24:24:68:542:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rameters underlying the MWTP function that avoids the Bartik-Epple endogeneity problem
4:90:5956:24:24:68:542:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:altogether.  We do this by exploiting the relationship between the quantity of the amenity
4:91:6046:24:24:68:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:being consumed and the attributes of the individuals doing the consumption.  That such a
4:92:6134:24:24:68:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relationship should exist in hedonic equilibrium goes back to the idea of “stratification” found
4:93:6230:24:24:68:542:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Ellickson (1971), which became the basis for estimable Tiebout sorting models.4Our pro-
4:94:6320:24:24:68:542:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:posed method is identified even in a single-market setting, given a flexible representation of
4:95:6414:24:24:68:542:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the hedonic price function and a parametric representation of the MWTP function.  Impor-
4:96:6502:24:23:68:542:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tantly,  our procedure is computationally simple and easy to implement.  Moreover,  it does
4:97:6593:23:18:68:542:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not require any more in terms of data or assumptions than does the standard hedonic model.
4:98:6683:18:16:81:542:262:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:2See, for example, Black (1999), Gayer, Hamilton, and Viscusi (2000), Bui and Mayer (2003), Davis (2004),

4:102:7014:8:16:81:542:214:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3Deacon et al.  (1998) noted that “To date no hedonic model with site specific environmental amenities
4:103:7116:16:12:68:542:198:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:has successfully estimated the second stage marginal willingness to pay function.”  Since that time, a number
4:104:7225:12:12:68:542:186:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of papers have examined the problem of recovering preferences from hedonic estimates.  Bajari and Benkard
4:105:7330:12:12:68:542:174:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2005) avoid the Bartik-Epple endogeneity problem by relying on strong parametric assumptions on utility
4:106:7434:12:12:68:542:162:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:that turn Rosen’s second-stage from an estimation problem into a preference-inversion procedure.  We report
4:107:7541:12:11:68:542:150:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:results based on their suggested procedure in our application.  Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2004) provide
4:108:7649:11:12:68:542:139:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:an alternative approach to recovering MWTP that imposes very little in terms of parametric restrictions, but
4:109:7757:12:12:68:542:127:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:requires an additive separability assumption in the MWTP specification.  Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim
4:110:7859:12:12:68:542:115:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(2010) illustrate conditions under which non-separable utility functions may be non-parametrically identified
4:111:7968:12:9:68:413:103:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(in both single and multiple markets) and propose a non-parametric estimator.
4:112:8045:9:15:81:542:94:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:4See, for example, Epple, Filimon and Romer (1984), Epple and Romano (1998), Epple and Platt (1998),

5:115:8257:24:24:68:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using data on large changes in violent crime rates in the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Area
5:116:8350:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over the period 1994 to 2000.  We find that recovering the full MWTP function is economically
5:117:8443:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important; an individual’s marginal willingness to pay to avoid an incident of violent crime
5:118:8535:24:24:68:542:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(measured by cases per 100,000 residents) increases by 10 cents with each additional incident.

5:121:8823:24:24:68:542:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:naive estimators, which ignore this effect, yield estimates of total willingness to pay for crime
5:122:8920:24:24:68:542:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reductions in San Francisco that are significantly biased.  Similar problems are likely to arise
5:123:9016:24:24:68:542:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in other settings where policy changes are not marginal – e.g., air quality, school reform, and

5:125:9144:34:24:93:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 describes the endogeneity problem discussed
5:126:9230:24:24:68:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) and reiterates the intuition for why the problem has been
5:127:9321:24:24:68:542:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so difficult to solve with standard exclusion restrictions.  Section 3 describes our alternative
5:128:9417:24:24:68:542:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimation procedure in detail.  Section 4 describes the data used in our application – hous-
5:129:9510:24:24:68:542:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing transactions data from the San Francisco Metropolitan Area combined with violent and
5:130:9598:24:23:68:542:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:property crime data from the RAND California Database.  Section 5 reports the results of
5:131:9686:23:24:68:542:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applying our estimator to these data.  Section 6 calculates the welfare effects from the actual
5:132:9781:24:24:68:542:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-marginal changes in crime faced by a subset of homeowners and compares these welfare
5:133:9869:24:24:68:542:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects with those calculated with alternative procedures in the existing literature.  Finally,

6:137:10047:46:24:68:542:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  their  respective  1987  articles,  Epple  and  Bartik  each  discuss  the  econometric  problems
6:138:10148:24:24:68:542:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:induced by the equilibrium sorting process that underlies the formation of the hedonic price
6:139:10240:24:24:68:542:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function.   In  particular,  unobserved  determinants  of  tastes  affect  both  the  quantity  of  an
6:140:10342:24:24:68:542:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amenity  that  an  individual  consumes  and  (if  the  hedonic  price  function  is  not  linear)  the

6:142:10549:24:23:68:542:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Rosen’s two-step procedure, the quantity of the amenity that an individual consumes will
6:143:10640:23:24:68:542:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore  be  endogenous.   Moreover,  the  exclusion  restrictions  typically  used  to  estimate  a
6:144:10742:24:24:68:542:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand system (i.e., using supplier attributes as instruments) will not work because, in ad-
6:145:10834:24:24:68:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dition to affecting the quantity of amenity and the hedonic price paid for it, the unobservable
6:146:10929:24:24:68:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:component of preferences also determines the supplier from whom the individual purchases.
6:147:11018:24:24:68:542:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Supplier  attributes,  which  might  naturally  be  used  to  trace-out  the  demand  function,  are
6:148:11118:24:24:68:542:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore correlated with the unobserved determinants of MWTP because of the sorting pro-
6:149:11207:24:34:68:274:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cess underlying the hedonic equilibrium.
6:150:11247:34:24:93:542:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To make these ideas concrete, consider the following simple example which is based on
6:151:11332:24:52:68:463:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Epple’s model.  We begin with the quadratic hedonic price function given by:

7:170:12242:34:24:93:542:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The second stage of Rosen’s procedure seeks to recover the coefficients of demand (or

7:177:12751:34:24:93:542:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The problem we consider in this paper arises from the fact thatZdimust necessarily be

7:179:12932:24:24:68:542:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equation.  Noting thatZi=Zdiin hedonic equilibrium and combining Equations (2) and (3)

8:196:13485:24:34:68:469:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate Equation (3) directly, the literature has sought an instrument forZdi.
8:197:13564:34:24:93:542:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The typical approach to estimating demand functions with endogenous quantities uses
8:198:13647:24:24:68:542:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supply function shifters.  The problem with that approach in this context, however, is that
8:199:13738:24:24:68:542:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hedonic sorting induces a correlation betweenνdiandXsi.  Put differently,νdidetermines the

8:201:13915:34:24:93:542:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  three  respective  papers,  Epple  (1987),  Bartik  (1987),  and  Kahn  and  Lang  (1988)
8:202:14008:24:24:68:542:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:propose alternative instrumental variables strategies to deal with this problem.  Bartik, for
8:203:14101:24:23:68:541:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example,  suggests  instrumenting  forZdiwith  market  indicator  variables.   Kahn  and  Lang
8:204:14195:23:24:68:542:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest  a  similar  instrument  of  market  indicators  interacted  with  household  demographic
8:205:14292:24:24:68:542:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attributes.  The intuition for these strategies is that differences in the distribution of suppliers
8:206:14392:24:24:68:542:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across markets will provide an exogenous source of variation in the equilibrium quantity of the
8:207:14487:24:24:68:542:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amenity chosen by each individual.  The problem with these approaches is that they require
8:208:14577:24:24:68:542:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strong assumptions about cross-market preference homogeneity and the instrument may not
8:209:14664:24:24:68:542:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:induce sufficient variation in the endogenous variable. Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2004)
8:210:14756:24:24:68:542:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:propose an alternative instrumental variables approach to overcome the endogeneity problem.
8:211:14847:24:24:68:542:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They show that due to the non-linearity of the hedonic model, the conditional expectation

8:214:15112:24:23:68:542:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market setting.  Our proposed estimation strategy differs from these previous approaches as
8:215:15203:23:18:68:499:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we avoid instrumental variables altogether.  Our strategy is the subject of Section 3.

9:222:15701:23:24:68:541:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price of the amenityZ(from the estimation of the hedonic price function) to its marginal
9:223:15789:24:24:68:541:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benefit (which is a function ofZ) and use the resulting expression as the estimating equation.

9:227:16156:24:24:68:542:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nothing requires us to write the estimating equation in this manner.  While this representation
9:228:16251:24:24:68:542:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does provide an intuitive interpretation of utility maximization, it is the “marginal cost equals
9:229:16348:24:24:68:542:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal benefit” econometric specification itself which has created the endogeneity problem
9:230:16440:24:34:68:292:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that has plagued this literature for decades.

9:236:16943:24:23:68:542:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be orthogonal in the hedonic model, we are left with a familiar econometric modeling en-

9:241:17395:24:24:68:542:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach is intuitive and simple.  In the general case of our model, where a closed-form for

10:248:18020:24:24:68:542:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applicable to a much richer specification of the model (as discussed in Section 3.2), we present

13:399:22774:24:23:68:542:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our application in Section 5).11In this case, we are still able to estimate the model using

13:404:23209:23:24:68:542:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(fromZtoνd), a closed-form solution forνdi,jis sufficient for forming the likelihood of observing
13:405:23306:24:35:68:88:295:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Zi,j.
13:406:23311:35:23:93:542:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the following example,  we impose no parametric assumption on the price function,

13:408:23486:19:16:77:542:218:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:10One could also use this additional information with a more general estimation strategy to overidentify
13:409:23590:16:8:68:173:202:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the model’s parameters.
13:410:23613:8:16:77:542:194:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:11As a general rule, one should not expect the hedonic price gradient to be linear. Additionally, specifying the
13:411:23725:16:12:68:542:178:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:MWTP to be linear is not inconsistent with a nonlinear price gradient in equilibrium; as clearly demonstrated
13:412:23834:12:12:68:542:166:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:by  Ekeland,  Heckman,  and  Nesheim  (2004),  a  linear  MWTP  function  alone  does  not  imply  a  linear  price
13:413:23949:12:12:68:542:154:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:gradient.  For the equilibrium price gradient to be linear (with demand- and supply-side heterogeneity),  it
13:414:24057:12:12:68:542:142:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:would not only require that consumers have a perfectly linear MWTP function, but also that suppliers have
13:415:24162:12:12:68:542:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:a perfectly linear marginal willingness-to-accept function and that shocks to both preferences and profits are
13:416:24272:12:11:68:542:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:exactly normal.  A key insight of the Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim paper is that very minor perturbations
13:417:24378:11:0:68:530:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of any of these conditions will lead to substantial non-linearity in the resulting equilibrium price gradient.

16:650:28068:24:24:68:542:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification, as the nature of our estimator allows for easy illustration of what data features
16:651:28165:24:34:68:322:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pin down the parameters of the MWTP function.
16:652:28210:34:24:93:542:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Consider the model with linear MWTP outlined earlier in this section. When the MWTP
16:653:28293:24:24:68:541:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intercept (α1), the coefficients onXd(α3), and the MWTP variance (σ2) are common across
16:654:28380:24:24:68:541:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets, they are identified by the meanZ, the covariance betweenZandXd, and the variance
16:655:28469:24:24:68:541:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ofZ, respectively.  Four sources of variation identify the slope of the MWTP function.  The
16:656:28560:24:24:68:541:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first source is the sensitivity of meanZto changes in the price gradient across markets.  The
16:657:28653:24:24:68:541:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second source is the sensitivity of the variance ofZto changes in the price gradient across
16:658:28744:24:24:68:541:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets.   The  third  source  is  the  sensitivity  of  the  covariance  ofZandXto  changes  in
16:659:28840:24:23:68:542:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price  gradient  across markets.  The  final,  fourth  source  is the  nonlinearity  of the  price
16:660:28942:23:24:68:541:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gradient;Zwill not be distributed normally when the gradient is nonlinear creating additional
16:661:29035:24:0:68:514:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identifying variation (particularly ifZis allowed to have market-specific distributions).
17:662:29126:0:24:93:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When the intercept of the MWTP function is allowed to vary by market, the variation
17:663:29209:24:24:68:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  meanZacross  markets  is  used  to  identify  the  market-specific  intercepts  of  the  MWTP
17:664:29306:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function and is no longer available to identify the slope of MWTP. In this case, higher levels
17:665:29400:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of meanZare associated with higher market-specific values forα1,j, all else equal.  A similar
17:666:29493:24:24:68:542:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:logic  applies  when  the  coefficients  onXdare  allowed  to  vary  by  market  and  differences  in
17:667:29594:24:24:68:541:577:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f8:B:the covariance betweenZandXdare used to identify{α3,j}Jj=1or when the variance ofνd
17:668:29677:24:24:68:542:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is allowed to vary by market and variance ofZis used to identify{σ2j}Jj=1.  Finally, when all
17:669:29770:24:24:68:542:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the parameters of the MWTP function are allowed to vary by market, this is analogous to
17:670:29860:24:24:68:542:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple single-market cases and the non-linearity of the price gradient is the only remaining
17:671:29954:24:24:68:542:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:source of identification of the MWTP slope.  This is consistent with the established wisdom in
17:672:30048:24:24:68:542:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the hedonic literature - one either needs a non-linear hedonic price gradient or multi-market

22:794:37366:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or later than the observed transaction date.  Second, to control for major improvements or
22:795:37456:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:degradations,  we drop any property with an observed average appreciation or depreciation

22:800:37923:24:24:68:542:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after using the consumer price index to convert all transaction prices into 2000 dollars,  we
22:801:38016:24:24:68:542:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drop one percent of observations from each tail of the price distribution to minimize the effect
22:802:38112:24:24:68:542:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of outliers.  As we merge the pollution data using the property’s geographic coordinates, we
22:803:38204:24:24:68:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drop properties where latitude and longitude are missing.  Finally, we drop houses with more

28:935:47123:41:24:68:542:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this subsection, we report the results from our procedure for recovering estimates of the

29:951:47879:0:24:93:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first column of Table (8) reports the results from our estimator.  First, consider the
29:952:47969:24:24:68:541:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient on violent crime,α2, which reveals the amount by which the individual’s MWTP
29:953:48057:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to avoid violent crime changes with an increase in this disamenity.  Intuitively, this coefficient
29:954:48155:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should be negative, indicating that the MWTP to avoid violent crime increases as the rate of
29:955:48247:24:24:68:542:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:violent crime increases (consistent with a demand curve for public safety that is downward
29:956:48337:24:24:68:542:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sloping).  We find this to be the case with our model;  each additional incident per 100,000
29:957:48429:24:24:68:542:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:residents raises MWTP to avoid violent crime by 10 cents.  As we show in Section 6, this has
29:958:48521:24:24:68:542:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important implications for the value ascribed to large reductions in violent crime rates like
29:959:48614:24:34:68:306:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those witnessed over the period of our sample.
29:960:48660:34:24:93:542:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Looking at the the remaining coefficient estimates derived using our model, an increase
29:961:48747:24:24:68:542:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in income of $1,000 per year increases MWTP to avoid violent crime by 5.8 cents (consistent
29:962:48838:24:24:68:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  public  safety  being  a  normal  good).   Considering  differences  in  MWTP  by  race,  the
29:963:48937:24:24:68:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:excluded group (Whites) has the highest mean MWTP to avoid violent crime.  Our model
29:964:49021:24:24:68:542:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that Asian-Pacific Islanders have a slightly lower mean MWTP (as indicated by their
29:965:49113:24:24:68:542:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive intercept shift of $2.84).  Blacks have the lowest mean MWTP to avoid violent crime,
29:966:49206:24:34:68:181:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:followed by Hispanics.
29:967:49228:34:24:93:542:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For the sake of comparison, the second column of Table (8) reports the results from the
29:968:49315:24:24:68:542:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:traditional Rosen estimation approach.  These results are strikingly different from the results
29:969:49410:24:24:68:542:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presented in the first column.  In contrast to our estimator, estimates from the Rosen model
29:970:49502:24:23:68:542:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that increases in violent crime reduce the MWTP to avoid violent crime (indicating
29:971:49592:23:24:68:542:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the demand curve for public safety is upward sloping).  This is exactly the direction of
29:972:49685:24:24:68:542:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bias suggested by both Bartik and Epple and leads to upwardly biased estimates of the welfare
29:973:49778:24:24:68:542:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with non-marginal reductions in violent crime (which we show in Section 6).  Ad-
29:974:49869:24:24:68:542:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ditionally, while the coefficient on income is of the same sign, the magnitude is much smaller.
29:975:49964:24:24:68:542:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, race does not appear to play an economically significant role in the estimates derived
29:976:50059:24:0:68:536:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using the Rosen estimation approach (although the coefficients are statistically significant).

30:1008:50833:46:24:68:542:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As  is  clear  from  our  data  description,  the  San  Francisco  Metropolitan  Area  experienced  a
30:1009:50934:24:0:68:542:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large and persistent reduction in average violent crime rates over the course of our sample
31:1010:51027:0:24:68:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period.  Similar reductions have been observed in numerous other cities across the US. Out of
31:1011:51120:24:24:68:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 25 cities that he considers, Levitt (2004) ranks San Francisco 12th in terms of the size of
31:1012:51215:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the reduction in homicides experienced between 1991 - 2001.  This change in the violent crime
31:1013:51308:23:35:68:524:625:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:rate represents a significant improvement on average and is, importantly, non-marginal.24
31:1014:51397:35:24:93:542:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There is a large and growing literature aimed at valuing the benefits of crime reductions
31:1015:51486:24:23:68:542:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(with, for example, the goal of conducting cost-benefit analysis of police force expansions).
31:1016:51579:23:24:68:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This literature was  recently  surveyed by  Heaton  (2010).  He notes that  the property value
31:1017:51673:24:24:68:542:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hedonic technique is valuable for recovering the intangible costs of crime (e.g.,  lost quality
31:1018:51768:24:24:68:542:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of life for fear of victimization or effective loss of public space).  Such intangibles are likely
31:1019:51866:24:24:68:542:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be particularly important for measuring the costs of violent crime (a point emphasized by
31:1020:51958:24:34:68:372:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Linden and Rockoff (2008) with respect to sexual offenses).
31:1021:52017:34:24:93:542:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For this welfare analysis, we consider the set of all individuals who purchased a house in
31:1022:52107:24:24:68:542:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1999 (summary statistics describing these individuals is given in Table (5)).  We then measure
31:1023:52201:24:24:68:542:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the value of the crime changes that these individuals actually experienced between 1999 and
31:1024:52292:24:24:68:542:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2000.  It is highly likely that these individuals still occupy the same residence in 2000 and, as
31:1025:52389:24:24:68:542:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we show in this section, the changes that occurred over this year were substantial enough that
31:1026:52483:24:24:68:542:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proper identification of the MWTP function becomes important in measuring their change in
31:1027:52572:24:24:68:542:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:welfare.  In particular, Figure (4) illustrates the distribution of changes in violent crime rates
31:1028:52670:24:24:68:542:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experienced by this set of households.  The 1999 data allows us to consider the welfare changes
31:1029:52765:24:23:68:542:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with both reductions and increases in crime; approximately sixty percent of these
31:1030:52857:23:24:68:542:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households  experienced  reductions  in  violent  crime  during  this  period  while  the  remaining
31:1031:52957:24:18:68:334:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forty percent experienced increases in violent crime.
31:1032:53010:18:16:77:542:156:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:24Levitt (2004) discusses six factors that he argues were not responsible for these declines, including economic
31:1033:53122:16:12:68:542:140:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:growth  and  reduced  unemployment,  shifting  age  and  racial  demographics,  changes  in  policing  strategies,
31:1034:53236:12:12:68:542:128:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:changes in gun control laws and laws controlling concealed weapons, and changes in capital punishment.  He
31:1035:53342:12:12:68:542:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:argues instead that there is a strong case to be made for the role of increasing size of the police force, increased
31:1036:53458:12:12:68:542:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:incarceration rats, declines in the crack epidemic, and the legalization of abortion twenty years prior.  The
31:1037:53567:12:12:68:542:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:relative  importance  of  each  of  these  factors  is  still  a  contentious  topic.   See,  for  example,  Blumstein  and
31:1038:53690:12:0:68:141:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Wallman (2006).

32:1040:53785:393:24:93:542:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For the purposes of illustration, we report valuations based on three different estimation
32:1041:53875:24:24:68:542:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies:  (i) Bishop-Timmins, (ii) Rosen, and (iii) horizontal MWTP. The third approach
32:1042:53965:24:24:68:542:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assigns a constant willingness to pay to each individual equal to the slope of the hedonic price
32:1043:54061:24:24:68:542:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function  at  their  observed  housing  choice.   As  the  utility  function  is  assumed  to  be  linear
32:1044:54166:24:24:68:542:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inZ(i.e.,  the  MWTP  function  is  constant  inZ),  this  approach  corresponds  to  either  the
32:1045:54263:24:24:68:542:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“inversion” procedure outlined in Bajari and Benkard (2005) or to the Rosen (1974) model
32:1046:54351:24:24:68:542:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  the  endogeneity  problem  is  trivially  solved  by  assuming  that  the  MWTP  function
32:1047:54447:24:23:68:541:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:doesn’t depend onZ.  In this case, the welfare effects may be calculated as the area of the
32:1048:54538:23:24:68:542:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rectangle under the horizontal MWTP, with the width given by the experienced change in
32:1049:54624:24:0:68:542:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:violent crime.  For the first two strategies, the value associated with a change in the violent
33:1050:54721:0:24:68:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime rate is calculated as the area of the trapezoid under the MWTP function over the width
33:1051:54813:24:34:68:287:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the experienced change in violent crime.
33:1052:54856:34:24:93:542:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We report results separately for the sixty percent of buyers who experienced a reduction
33:1053:54944:24:24:68:542:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in their violent crime rate and for the remaining forty percent of buyers who experienced an

33:1065:55502:60:24:93:542:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The bias from improperly accounting for the effect of a non-marginal change in violent
33:1066:55588:24:24:68:542:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime on MWTP is evident.  Consider first the case of crime reductions.  The Rosen model and
33:1067:55680:24:24:68:542:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:horizontal MWTP yield estimates of the average WTP for observed reductions that are 1.49
33:1068:55768:24:24:68:542:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:times greater than our model, implying an almost fifty-percent upward bias.  The direction
33:1069:55858:24:23:68:542:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  bias  is  reversed  when  we  consider  increases  in  the  rates  of  violent  crime.   Here,  the
33:1070:55966:23:24:68:542:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alternative  models  yield  estimates  of  average  WTP  for  observed  crime  reductions  that  are
33:1071:56066:24:24:68:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only 0.59 of our estimate.  These differences are far from trivial and would have an important
33:1072:56160:24:18:68:256:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impacts on any cost-benefit analysis.
33:1073:56197:18:16:77:542:128:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:25In the calculations for buyers experiencing a decrease in violent crime, we restrict the marginal willingness
33:1074:56308:16:12:68:542:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to pay curve to be non-positive.  This has little effect on the welfare implications; our average willingness to
33:1075:56420:12:0:68:232:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:pay without this restriction is 243.68.
34:1076:56461:0:46:68:190:696:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:7    Conclusion
34:1077:56476:46:24:68:542:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Researchers regularly ascribe downward sloping demand curves to households for goods rang-
34:1078:56566:24:24:68:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing from breakfast cereals to BMWs.  In fact, recovering the price elasticity of demand for such
34:1079:56662:24:23:68:542:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goods constitutes one of the main activities undertaken by applied microeconomists.  How-
34:1080:56751:23:24:68:542:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ever, because of the difficult endogeneity problems associated with the recovery of the MWTP
34:1081:56843:24:24:68:542:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function using the hedonic technique, the same flexibility has generally not been applied to
34:1082:56935:24:24:68:542:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household demand for local public goods and amenities.  Instead, applications of the hedo-
34:1083:57025:24:24:68:542:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nic method have tended to focus only on the first-stage hedonic price regression; recovering
34:1084:57117:24:24:68:542:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters  that  only  yield  valid  welfare  estimates  for  marginal  policies.   In  order  to  prop-
34:1085:57222:24:24:68:542:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:erly evaluate the welfare effects associated with larger policies, the researcher must recover
34:1086:57316:24:24:68:542:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the structural parameters of the MWTP function.  In this paper, we propose an estimation
34:1087:57404:24:24:68:542:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach for the recovery of these parameters,  while avoiding the endogeneity problems so
34:1088:57494:24:34:68:304:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:commonly associated with the hedonic model.
34:1089:57537:34:24:93:542:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We show that there is no fundamental endogeneity problem in the hedonic model; the
34:1090:57619:24:24:68:542:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:endogeneity problems are largely manufactured and are a result of framing Rosen’s second
34:1091:57707:24:24:68:542:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stage regression in terms of marginal cost (implicit attribute price) equaling marginal benefit
34:1092:57802:24:24:68:542:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(marginal utility from consuming the amenity in question).  We instead rearrange the informa-
34:1093:57895:24:24:68:542:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion provided by the hedonic equilibrium and arrive at a simple modeling environment with
34:1094:57984:24:23:68:542:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a single endogenous outcome variable, a vector of exogenous variables, and an econometric
34:1095:58073:23:35:68:96:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:error.
34:1096:58079:35:24:93:542:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Estimation of the model is straightforward and consists of a standard Maximum Like-
34:1097:58162:24:23:68:542:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lihood  procedure  which  employs  a  textbook  change-of-variables  technique.   In  a  restricted
34:1098:58261:23:24:68:542:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:version of the model, a closed-form solution for the amenity of interest may be found analyt-
34:1099:58354:24:24:68:542:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically and the change of variables is not required.  Estimation in the simplest version of the
34:1100:58448:24:0:68:542:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model may even be reduced to an indirect least squares procedure, exploiting the one-to-one
35:1101:58541:0:24:68:542:696:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mapping between the structural and reduced-form parameters.  Like the Rosen model,  our
35:1102:58628:24:24:68:542:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach is (i) quite intuitive, as it is derived from the first-order condition for utility max-
35:1103:58725:24:23:68:542:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imization, (ii) able to incorporate rich individual- and market- level heterogeneity, and (iii)
35:1104:58820:23:24:68:542:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:computationally light and easy to implement.  Additionally, our model requires no more in
35:1105:58909:24:35:68:314:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terms of data than the standard hedonic model.
35:1106:58955:35:23:93:542:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed estimator
35:1107:59040:23:24:68:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presents  very  little  bias  in  finite  samples.   Applying  our  model  to  data  on  violent  crime
35:1108:59143:24:24:68:542:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rates in California’s Bay Area, we find that properly accounting for the shape of the MWTP
35:1109:59233:24:24:68:542:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function has important implications for measuring the welfare effects of non-marginal changes
35:1110:59326:24:24:68:542:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in violent crime.  Considering the welfare effects associated with the observed one-year change
35:1111:59421:24:24:68:542:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in crime for those households that purchased a house in 1999, we find that alternative modeling
35:1112:59516:24:24:68:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:procedures overstate benefits (for those households which experienced a decrease in violent
35:1113:59607:24:24:68:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:crime) by fifty percent relative to our approach and understate costs (for those households
35:1114:59698:24:24:68:542:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  experienced  an  increase  in  violent  crime)  by  forty  percent  relative  to  our  approach.
35:1115:59801:24:24:68:542:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These  differences  are  both  statistically  and  economically  significant  and  consequential  for
35:1116:59902:24:0:68:492:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost-benefit analyses of policies that may have large impacts on future crime rates.
