2:26:1270:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) significantly expanded public insurance eligibility
2:27:1375:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:and coverage for children in "working poor" families.  Despite this success, it is estimated that over
2:28:1477:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:6 million children who are eligible for public insurance remain uninsured.  An important first step
2:29:1576:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:for designing strategies to increase enrollment of eligible but uninsured children is to determine how
2:30:1678:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the take-up of public coverage varies within the population.  Because of their low rates of insurance
2:31:1779:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:coverage and unique enrollment barriers, children of immigrants are an especially important group
2:32:1876:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:to consider.  We compare the effect of SCHIP eligibility on the insurance coverage of children of foreign-born
2:33:1986:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:and native-born parents.  In contrast to research on the earlier Medicaid expansions, we find similar
2:34:2087:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:take-up rates for the two groups.  This suggests that state outreach strategies were not only effective
2:35:2190:14:28:72:526:462:12:Times:12:Times:at increasing take-up overall, but were successful in reducing disparities in access to coverage.

3:54:2665:0:13:72:156:708:144:Times:144:Times:I.   Introduction 
3:55:2683:13:14:72:75:695:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:56:2683:14:28:108:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:In the past two decades there have been substantial initiatives at the state and federal 
3:57:2772:28:27:72:495:653:144:Times:144:Times:levels aimed at increasing insurance coverage among children.  Most recently, the State 
3:58:2860:27:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) expanded public insurance eligibility for children 
3:59:2955:28:28:72:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:in “working poor” families.  SCHIP significantly increased public insurance coverage and 
3:60:3044:28:27:72:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:decreased the rate of uninsured among children in families with incomes between 100 and 300 
3:61:3136:27:28:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:percent of the federal poverty level (Cunningham, Hadley and Reschovsky 2002; Lo Sasso and 
3:62:3227:28:27:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:Buchmueller 2004; Hudson, Selden and Banthin 2005).  By 2002, roughly half of all children in 
3:63:3321:27:28:72:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:the US were income-eligible for some kind of public health insurance (Selden, Hudson and 
3:64:3410:28:28:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:Banthin 2004).  However, despite this success, it is estimated that over 6 million children who 
3:65:3506:28:27:72:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:are eligible for public insurance remain uninsured.  These children represent a majority of all 
3:66:3602:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:uninsured children.  Extending coverage to these eligible but uninsured children is an important 
3:67:3699:28:27:72:374:377:144:Times:144:Times:but challenging objective for federal and state policy makers.   
3:68:3764:27:28:108:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:A crucial first step for addressing this problem is to determine how the take-up of public 
3:69:3855:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:coverage varies within the population.  Children of immigrants are an especially important and 
3:70:3950:27:28:72:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:growing group to consider.  One in five children under age 18 is either an immigrant or is a 
3:71:4043:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:member of an immigrant family; since 1990 the number of children in immigrant families has 
3:72:4134:28:27:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:risen seven times faster than the number in native families (Morse 2000).  Previous research 
3:73:4227:27:28:72:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:shows that foreign-born adults are nearly three times as likely to be uninsured as native-born 
3:74:4322:28:27:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:Americans (Buchmueller et al 2007) and that children of immigrants are also more likely to be 
3:75:4416:27:28:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:uninsured than children whose parents were born in the US (Ku and Matani 2001).  Immigrants’ 
3:76:4509:28:28:72:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:lower rate of insurance coverage is driven mainly by a lower rate of employer-sponsored 
3:77:4597:28:0:72:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:insurance, which in turn is largely explained by differences in human capital and the types of 
4:78:4693:0:27:72:513:708:144:Times:144:Times:jobs held by immigrants and native-born workers.  While this makes public insurance more 
4:79:4782:27:28:71:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:important as a source of coverage for children of immigrants, because of language and cultural 
4:80:4877:28:27:71:471:653:144:Times:144:Times:barriers they may be less likely than children in non-immigrant families to enroll.   
4:81:4963:27:28:107:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:Despite the well documented gap in insurance coverage, there has been surprisingly little 
4:82:5053:28:28:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:research on how public insurance take-up differs between immigrants and natives.  One study of 
4:83:5148:28:27:71:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:the Medicaid expansions of the late 1980s and early 1990s found a weaker response to Medicaid 
4:84:5242:27:28:71:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility among children of foreign-born parents as compared to children whose parents were 
4:85:5336:28:27:71:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:born in the US (Currie 1999).  Because SCHIP was enacted just after the 1996 Federal welfare 
4:86:5429:27:28:71:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:reform legislation, which singled out recent immigrants for less generous benefits, there is 
4:87:5522:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:additional reason to expect a lower take-up of SCHIP among the children of immigrants.  On the 
4:88:5617:28:27:72:504:432:144:Times:144:Times:other hand, the SCHIP legislation included much greater emphasis on outreach, including 
4:89:5705:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:marketing campaigns in languages other than English (Aizer 2003, forthcoming).  If these efforts 
4:90:5802:28:27:72:453:377:144:Times:144:Times:were effective, they may have reduced nativity-related differences in take-up.   
4:91:5883:27:28:108:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:Because non-natives are so much less likely to have private insurance than natives, it is 
4:92:5973:28:27:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:possible that the problem of “crowd-out”—i.e., the substitution of public insurance for private 
4:93:6069:27:28:72:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:coverage—may be less of an issue for immigrants.  However, recent research on the impact of 
4:94:6161:28:28:72:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:welfare reform on health insurance found that reductions in public coverage among immigrants 
4:95:6254:28:27:72:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:were completely offset by increases in private coverage, a striking finding implying 100% 
4:96:6344:27:28:72:404:212:144:Times:144:Times:substitution of private coverage for public coverage (Borjas 2003).    
4:97:6415:28:27:108:542:184:144:Times:144:Times: In this paper we test whether the effect of the SCHIP expansion was different for children 
4:98:6506:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:of foreign-born and US-born parents.  The analysis is based on repeat cross-section data from the 
4:99:6604:28:28:72:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:Current Population Survey (CPS) and the same research design employed successfully in 
4:100:6690:28:0:72:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:previous research on the effects of Medicaid and SCHIP expansions on insurance coverage for 
5:101:6783:0:27:72:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:the entire population of children (Currie and Gruber 1996; Cutler and Gruber 1996; Ham and 
5:102:6874:27:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:Shore-Sheppard 2001; Lo Sasso and Buchmueller 2004; Hudson, Selden and Banthin 2005).  
5:103:6961:28:27:72:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:Specifically, we use an instrumental variables approach in which the effect of SCHIP eligibility 
5:104:7058:27:28:72:497:626:144:Times:144:Times:is identified by cross-state differences in the timing and extent of changes in the income 
5:105:7149:28:28:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility limit over the period from 1996 to 2000.  We test for the effect of SCHIP on insurance 
5:106:7248:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:coverage from any source as well as on the probability of having public insurance (take-up) and 
5:107:7344:27:28:72:361:543:144:Times:144:Times:on the probability of having private coverage (crowd-out).   
5:108:7405:28:27:108:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:In contrast to earlier research, our results suggest that take-up among the children of the 
5:109:7497:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:foreign born was at least as high as natives.  Estimates of the effect of eligibility on reported 
5:110:7595:28:28:72:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:coverage by any private insurance suggest that there was little crowd-out for either group.  
5:111:7688:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:However, earlier work on SCHIP suggests that some survey respondents misclassify public 
5:112:7776:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:insurance provided through private carriers as private, non-group coverage.  Correcting for this 
5:113:7873:28:27:72:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:misclassification tended to increase take-up estimates and increase crowd-out estimates for both 
5:114:7970:27:28:72:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:groups.  The range of crowd-out estimates was generally similar between natives and non-
5:115:8058:28:27:72:118:322:144:Times:144:Times:natives.

5:120:8125:13:28:108:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:SCHIP was established by Federal legislation in 1997 and enacted by states over the next 
5:121:8214:28:27:72:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:several years.  Like prior studies, we exploit variation in the timing and extent of the SCHIP 
5:122:8309:27:28:72:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility expansions to identify effects on coverage.1  Eleven states implemented their program 
5:123:8407:28:32:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:in 1997, 34 did so in 1998 and by 2000 every state had a program in place.  Cross-state variation

5:125:8553:7:16:108:526:90:42:Times:100:Times:1 Details on when states implemented SCHIP and how income eligibility limits changed are provided in 
5:126:8654:16:0:71:159:74:100:Times:100:Times:Appendix Table A-1. 
6:127:8675:0:27:72:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:in the extent of expansion comes from differences in income thresholds both before and after 
6:128:8768:27:28:71:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:implementation.  Prior to SCHIP, states were required to cover children 6 years of age and under 
6:129:8865:28:27:71:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:up to 133 percent of poverty, though they were allowed to expand coverage up to 185 percent 
6:130:8957:27:28:71:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:and still receive federal matching dollars.2  Because there were no such Federal standards for 
6:131:9052:28:28:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:older children, there was much more variation in eligibility limits.  Since the implementation of 
6:132:9150:28:27:72:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:SCHIP, in most states income eligibility limits are the same for children of all ages.  In 2000, the 
6:133:9251:27:28:72:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:last year of our data, the modal income eligibility threshold was 200% of the FPL (18 states).  
6:134:9347:28:27:72:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:Nine states expanded eligibility even further and the other 26 states had income limits of 
6:135:9438:27:28:72:257:488:144:Times:144:Times:between 133% and 192% of the FPL.  
6:136:9472:28:28:108:491:460:144:Times:144:Times:Because states were given considerable flexibility, state programs vary in other 
6:137:9553:28:27:72:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:dimensions as well (Wolfe and Scrivner 2005; Bansak and Raphael 2007).  States were given the 
6:138:9647:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:option of expanding their Medicaid program, establishing a new stand-alone program, or both.  
6:139:9741:28:27:72:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:The SCHIP legislation required states to implement mechanisms to limit the crowding out of 
6:140:9832:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:private insurance, but did not prescribe a specific approach.  The most common strategy that 
6:141:9925:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:states have adopted is to require that children must be without insurance for some period prior to 
6:142:10024:27:28:72:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:enrolling.  Thirty-three states have such waiting periods, ranging from three to twelve months.  
6:143:10121:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:Some prior studies indicate that these mandatory waiting periods have been effective at reducing 
6:144:10218:28:27:72:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:the substitution of public insurance for private coverage (LoSasso and Buchmueller 2004; 
6:145:10307:27:28:72:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:Kronebusch and Elbel 2004; Bansak and Raphael 2007), though a recent study by Gruber and 
6:146:10396:28:27:72:276:184:144:Times:144:Times:Simon (2006) find that they had no effect. 
6:147:10439:27:28:108:515:157:144:Times:144:Times:Compared to the earlier Medicaid expansions the SCHIP legislation placed a greater 
6:148:10522:28:20:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:emphasis on and provided more funding for outreach efforts.  States were allowed to experiment

6:150:10665:8:16:108:538:101:42:Times:100:Times:2  As of 1996 six states (CA, MN, RI, TN, VT and WA) had used state funds to expand eligibility for some 
6:151:10770:16:11:71:167:85:100:Times:100:Times:children even further.

7:153:10797:0:27:72:504:708:144:Times:144:Times:with different strategies for disseminating information about the program, simplifying the 
7:154:10888:27:28:71:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:application and enrollment process and improving retention.  These efforts may explain why 
7:155:10979:28:27:72:537:653:144:Times:144:Times:SCHIP appears to have had a stronger effect on public insurance coverage than earlier Medicaid 
7:156:11074:27:28:72:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:expansions that were targeted at children in families with incomes above the poverty line.  
7:157:11166:28:28:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:LoSasso and Buchmueller (2004), Hudson, Selden and Banthin (2005) and Bansak and Raphael 
7:158:11255:28:27:72:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:(2007) find that 8 to 10% of children who gained income eligibility for SCHIP enrolled in the 
7:159:11349:27:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:program.  While this take-up rate may seem low, it is comparable to the rate that Card and Shore-
7:160:11446:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:Sheppard (2004) estimate for an earlier Medicaid expansion target at children in families with 
7:161:11541:27:28:72:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:incomes up to 100% of the FPL and larger than what they find for expansions affecting children 
7:162:11636:28:28:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:with family incomes between 100% and 133% of the FPL.  Moreover, because these SCHIP 
7:163:11721:28:27:72:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:take-up estimates do not account for the fact that many children who meet income eligibility 
7:164:11814:27:28:72:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:rules are not actually eligible for SCHIP because they already have private coverage, they 
7:165:11905:28:27:72:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:understate take-up among children meeting all eligibility requirements (Cunningham 2003).

7:169:12038:27:28:108:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:The existing study that is most similar to ours is one by Currie (1999) that compares the 
7:170:12128:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:response of children of immigrants and children with native-born parents to Medicaid expansions 
7:171:12224:28:27:72:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:occurring between 1989 and 1992.  Currie finds that increased eligibility led to higher Medicaid 
7:172:12321:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:enrollment among children of native-born parents, but had no significant effect for children of 
7:173:12417:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:immigrants.  Medicaid eligibility did reduce private insurance coverage for immigrant children, 
7:174:12513:27:28:72:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:however.  She interprets this pattern as indicating that the Medicaid expansions induced some 
7:175:12607:28:28:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:immigrant parents to drop private coverage in favor of the “conditional coverage” for emergency 
7:176:12703:28:0:72:524:101:144:Times:144:Times:care to which they were entitled even if they did not formally enroll in the program.  Families 
8:177:12800:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:that drop private coverage when they become eligible for Medicaid reap a financial benefit by 
8:178:12894:27:28:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:forgoing monthly premium contributions while maintaining the ability to receive free care in the 
8:179:12991:28:27:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:case of emergency.  However, conditional coverage is not likely to improve access to primary or 
8:180:13087:27:28:71:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:preventive health care.  Indeed, while Currie finds that increased program eligibility led to 
8:181:13181:28:28:71:543:598:144:Times:144:Times:greater use of ambulatory care for children of native-born parents, she finds no effect for children 
8:182:13282:28:27:71:154:570:144:Times:144:Times:of immigrants.    
8:183:13300:27:28:107:539:543:144:Times:144:Times: SCHIP was passed shortly after landmark federal welfare reform legislation, the Personal 
8:184:13389:28:27:71:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).  In addition to setting 
8:185:13478:27:28:71:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:time limits for cash welfare payments, PRWORA restricted the eligibility of immigrants for 
8:186:13569:28:28:71:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:welfare and other public programs, including Medicaid.  Under Federal law, immigrants arriving 
8:187:13664:28:27:71:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:in the US after 1996 are prohibited from receiving Medicaid for five years.  However, states have 
8:188:13762:27:28:71:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:the option of using their own funds to insure new immigrants and a number have done so, and 14 
8:189:13857:28:27:71:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:states used their own funds to provide Medicaid benefits to recent immigrants (Tumlin et al. 
8:190:13950:27:28:71:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:1999).  Initially, the legislation also restricted eligibility for immigrants arriving prior to 1996, 
8:191:14052:28:27:71:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:though those provisions were never enacted.  Nonetheless, some analysts argue that by creating 
8:192:14147:27:28:71:505:295:144:Times:144:Times:confusion about eligibility rules and contributing to fears of deportation, PRWORA had a 
8:193:14236:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:“chilling effect”, decreasing program participation among immigrants who remained eligible for 
8:194:14331:28:27:72:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:these programs (Fix and Passel 1999, 2002; Borjas 2001, 2003; Kaushal and Kaestner 2005; 
8:195:14420:27:28:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:Lurie 2007).  Several studies show that since the enactment of PRWORA, Medicaid enrollment 
8:196:14511:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:has fallen considerably and that the decline is greater for foreign-born compared to native-born 
8:197:14608:27:28:72:423:157:144:Times:144:Times:persons (Borjas 2003; Kandula et al. 2004; Kaushal and Kaestner 2005). 
8:198:14679:28:28:108:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:While welfare reform may have depressed public insurance enrollment of immigrants and 
8:199:14765:28:0:72:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:their children relative to natives, some of the strategies that states used to increase SCHIP take-
9:200:14865:0:27:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:up are likely to have worked in the opposite direction.  It is widely believed that the complexity 
9:201:14964:27:28:72:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:of Medicaid eligibility rules and administrative procedures was a barrier to enrollment that 
9:202:15057:28:27:72:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:limited the impact of earlier eligibility expansions.  Some of these administrative reforms were 
9:203:15154:27:28:72:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:specifically targeted at immigrant families.  For example, parents are not required to provide 
9:204:15249:28:28:72:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:proof of their own citizenship when applying for coverage for their children and procedures for 
9:205:15345:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:verifying the legal status of the children were greatly simplified.  Other administrative reforms, 
9:206:15444:27:28:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:such as the use of shorter application forms and reductions in the amount of documentation 
9:207:15535:28:27:72:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:required, while not directly targeted at immigrants, may have been especially beneficial to 
9:208:15627:27:28:72:485:488:144:Times:144:Times:families with little prior experience with the system and limited English proficiency.   
9:209:15716:28:28:108:533:460:144:Times:144:Times: States with large immigrant populations tailored their outreach efforts to meet the needs 
9:210:15806:28:27:72:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:of those populations.  Several states use community-based organizations to identify eligible 
9:211:15899:27:28:72:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:families and to assist them with the application process.  Aizer (2003, forthcoming) studies the 
9:212:15996:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:effect of such organizations in California.  She finds that proximity to an organization providing 
9:213:16095:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:bilingual application assistance increased public insurance enrollment by up to 46 percent for 
9:214:16190:28:27:72:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:Hispanic and Asian children.  She also finds a significant effect of Spanish language television 
9:215:16287:27:28:72:289:295:144:Times:144:Times:ads on the enrollment of Hispanic children.

9:218:16347:27:28:108:521:212:144:Times:144:Times: Our data are drawn from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) for the years of 
9:219:16430:28:27:71:536:184:144:Times:144:Times:1997 to 2001, which provide information on household health insurance coverage for the period 
9:220:16524:27:48:72:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:from 1996 to 2000.3  Since most states enacted SCHIP in 1998, this provides between two to 
9:221:16615:48:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:222:16663:8:16:108:541:101:42:Times:100:Times:3 There are several well-known limitations of the CPS data on health insurance.  Although the questionnaire 
9:223:16771:16:11:72:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:refers to insurance coverage during the prior calendar year, some research suggests that many respondents do in fact 
9:224:16888:11:0:72:530:74:100:Times:100:Times:report current coverage status (Swartz 1986; Berger, Black and Scott 1998).   Nonetheless, following the previous 
10:225:17003:0:27:72:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:three years of data prior to the enactment of SCHIP and two to three years after.  After 2001, 
10:226:17098:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:income eligibility limits largely remained constant, but some states responded to the recession by 
10:227:17197:28:27:72:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:limiting SCHIP and Medicaid enrollment in other ways, while other states pursued parental 
10:228:17287:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:expansions using SCHIP funds (Aizer and Grogger 2003; Busch and Duchovny 2005).  Because 
10:229:17376:28:28:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:modeling these alternative expansion strategies adds considerable complexity and creates greater 
10:230:17473:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:potential policy endogeneity problems we opt to examine the initial program implementation by 
10:231:17567:27:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:studying the period through 2000.  These five years of data provide a sample size of 181,402 
10:232:17660:28:27:72:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:children who are less than 18 years old, living with their parents and not heads of their own 
10:233:17754:27:28:72:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:households.  Because parental nativity is a key variable in our analysis, we exclude observations 
10:234:17852:28:28:72:412:460:144:Times:144:Times:for which this information is missing, giving us a sample of 167,298.   
10:235:17923:28:27:108:528:432:144:Times:144:Times: A key methodological issue for this analysis concerns the way children are categorized 
10:236:18010:27:28:72:484:405:144:Times:144:Times:according to their parents’ nativity.  In our main analysis, we follow Borjas (2003) in 
10:237:18098:28:27:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:categorizing children based on the nativity of the head of their household.   In the full sample, we 
10:238:18198:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:have 130,689 children in families headed by a native-born adult (hereafter “natives”) and 36,609 
10:239:18295:28:27:72:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:children in families where the household head is foreign-born (hereafter “non-natives”).  We 
10:240:18388:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:obtain similar results when we define non-native children as those with at least one foreign-born 
10:241:18486:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:parent.4  Table 1 provides summary statistics for native and non-native children.  As has been 
10:242:18581:28:27:71:480:239:144:Times:144:Times:previously documented, non-natives have considerably higher uninsurance rates and 
10:243:18663:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:considerably lower private insurance coverage rates, regardless of whether we restrict the sample 
10:244:18761:28:27:72:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:to those in families at or below 300% of the federal poverty level.  Note also that the vast 
10:245:18854:27:37:72:456:157:144:Times:144:Times:majority of children in immigrant families are themselves native-born citizens.

10:248:19215:11:12:72:368:97:100:Times:100:Times:a change in the insurance questions that occurred in 1995 (Swartz 1997).

11:253:19380:28:27:108:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:We use the repeated cross-section data from the CPS to estimate several versions of the

11:258:19594:28:27:71:536:513:144:Times:144:Times:where the dependent variable COVERAGEi represents the type of health insurance held by child 
11:259:19687:27:28:72:534:486:144:Times:144:Times:i: public, private, or uninsured.  PUBELIG is an indicator for public insurance eligibility, which 
11:260:19786:28:27:72:529:458:144:Times:144:Times:is constructed based on the child’s age, family income and the eligibility standards effective in 
11:261:19884:27:28:72:524:431:144:Times:144:Times:the child’s state of residence at that time.5  The vector X includes the child’s age and standard 
11:262:19982:28:28:71:528:403:144:Times:144:Times:socio-demographic characteristics.  We include a full set of year and state dummies to account 
11:263:20077:28:27:71:539:375:144:Times:144:Times:for national trends in health insurance coverage and long-standing differences across states.  The 
11:264:20176:27:28:71:457:348:144:Times:144:Times:equation is estimated using a linear probability models for each insurance type.  
11:265:20257:28:27:107:504:320:144:Times:144:Times:All models are estimated on samples that are stratified by nativity.  Given the link

11:267:20429:28:27:71:526:265:144:Times:144:Times:includes several variables to account for the possibility that the state and year dummies do not 
11:268:20526:27:28:71:539:238:144:Times:144:Times:fully capture changes in labor market opportunities for different subpopulations.  We interact the 
11:269:20625:28:28:71:508:210:144:Times:144:Times:year dummies with categorical variables for education and race to account for the fact that 
11:270:20717:28:27:71:479:182:144:Times:144:Times:workers in different “skill” groups may have been affected differently by changes in 
11:271:20802:27:35:72:534:155:144:Times:144:Times:macroeconomic conditions over this period.  To account for state-specific economic shocks, we 
11:272:20896:35:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
11:273:20944:7:16:108:501:113:42:Times:100:Times:5 Lo Sasso and Buchmueller (2004) estimate models that allow for differences between states that 
11:274:21041:16:12:71:522:97:100:Times:100:Times:implemented SCHIP by expanding their existing Medicaid programs and those that established new stand-alone 
11:275:21148:12:11:71:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:programs.  Because those models indicated no statistically significant differences between these two approaches, we 
11:276:21264:11:0:71:296:74:100:Times:100:Times:use a single measure of eligibility for public insurance.  
12:277:21325:0:27:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:also include several regressors that vary by state and year: the state-level unemployment rate, the 
12:278:21425:27:28:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:gross state product (GSP) and the percentage of the state’s population receiving cash welfare 
12:279:21519:28:27:72:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:benefits each year.  The unemployment rate and GSP are included to account for the relationship 
12:280:21615:27:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:between local area macroeconomic conditions and insurance that has been documented by prior 
12:281:21707:28:28:72:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:studies (Cawley and Simon 2003; Glied and Jack 2003).  The average caseload is intended to 
12:282:21798:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:capture cross-state differences in the effect of welfare reform.  We also estimate models that 
12:283:21893:27:28:71:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:replace these state-level variables with full state/year interactions.  This specification has the 
12:284:21992:28:27:72:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:advantage of accounting for possible state-specific macroeconomic shocks in the most flexible 
12:285:22086:27:28:72:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:way.  However, it demands a lot of the data, leaving little residual variation for identifying the 
12:286:22185:28:28:72:161:460:144:Times:144:Times:effect of SCHIP.   
12:287:22203:28:27:108:541:432:144:Times:144:Times:As noted, most states restrict SCHIP eligibility to children who have been without private 
12:288:22294:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:insurance for a certain period of time.  Because this eligibility criterion is based on one of our 
12:289:22393:28:27:72:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:outcome variables, we cannot incorporate it directly in the construction of PUBELIG.  Therefore, 
12:290:22490:27:28:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:our regression estimates will understate the marginal take-up rate among children meeting all 
12:291:22584:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility criteria.  A rough adjustment can be made by dividing the coefficient on PUBELIG by 
12:292:22680:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:the percent of children in the sample who were uninsured.  In addition, because there is variation 
12:293:22779:28:28:72:497:267:144:Times:144:Times:across states in the length of the waiting period, we can estimate the effect of this policy 
12:294:22872:28:27:72:417:239:144:Times:144:Times:parameter on coverage by augmenting the regression model as follows: 
12:295:22941:27:29:72:75:212:144:Times:144:Times: 
12:296:22941:29:29:72:384:183:144:Times:144:Times:            COVERAGEci = α3c PUBELIGi   +α4c MONTHSi + βcXi  
12:297:23002:29:29:72:485:154:144:Times:144:Times:   + γcSTATEi + θcTIMEi + εci.     (2) 
12:298:23040:29:0:72:75:125:144:Times:144:Times: 
13:299:23042:0:27:72:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:In this equation, MONTHS represents the number of months a child who meets the program’s 
13:300:23131:27:28:72:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:income eligibility standards must be uninsured before qualifying for SCHIP.  In the pre-SCHIP 
13:301:23225:28:27:72:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:period this variable will take the value of zero for all children.  In the post-SCHIP period, it will 
13:302:23327:27:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:be zero for children in states without any waiting periods and for children eligible for Medicaid 
13:303:23425:28:28:72:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:rather than SCHIP; it will be non-zero for children eligible for an SCHIP related expansion 
13:304:23517:28:27:72:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:program for states that employed waiting periods.6  We expect the length of the waiting period to 
13:305:23615:27:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:have a negative effect on public coverage.  If the waiting period was effective at reducing crowd-
13:306:23713:28:27:72:332:515:144:Times:144:Times:out, the effect on private coverage should be positive. 
13:307:23769:27:28:108:506:488:144:Times:144:Times: During the time period we analyze, many states contracted with private insurers to 
13:308:23852:28:28:72:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:provide coverage to SCHIP and Medicaid beneficiaries; others designed their programs to 
13:309:23940:28:27:72:542:432:144:Times:144:Times:resemble private insurance in order to reduce stigma and thereby make coverage more attractive.  
13:310:24037:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:These strategies might make it difficult to distinguish public and private insurance in surveys like 
13:311:24138:28:27:72:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:the CPS as many parents whose children are covered through Medicaid or SCHIP may report 
13:312:24226:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:that coverage as private non-group.  Such classification errors would explain the finding that 
13:313:24321:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:increases in public insurance eligibility caused by the implementation of SCHIP was associated 
13:314:24416:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:with an increase in the percentage of CPS respondents reporting that their children had private 
13:315:24512:28:28:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:non-group coverage (Lo Sasso and Buchmueller 2004).  Cantor et al. (2007) provide additional 
13:316:24605:28:27:71:278:239:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that supports this interpretation.   
13:317:24651:27:28:107:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:There is less reason to expect public insurance to be reported as group coverage because 
13:318:24740:28:27:71:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:explicit mention to an employer or union is made in the questionnaire.  Therefore, in addition to 
13:319:24838:27:37:71:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:estimating models that assume the reported insurance variables as accurate, we estimate models 
13:320:24933:37:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
13:321:24981:7:16:108:532:113:42:Times:100:Times:6 In order to assign a value of MONTHS to children, it is necessary to infer eligibility based on income in 
13:322:25089:16:12:71:504:97:100:Times:100:Times:state non-Medicaid expansion programs.  Hence there is an implicit public eligibility calculation in creating 
13:323:25199:12:11:71:533:85:100:Times:100:Times:MONTHS, leading to the likely endogeneity of the variable.  We instrument for MONTHS using the interaction of 
13:324:25309:11:0:71:362:74:100:Times:100:Times:simulated eligibility (described below) with the state’s waiting period.    
14:325:25387:0:27:72:507:708:144:Times:144:Times:in which the dependent variable equals one if either public insurance or non-group private 
14:326:25478:27:28:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:insurance is reported.  This composite variable should capture all increases in public insurance 
14:327:25575:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:coverage, whether they be accurately reported or misreported as increases in non-group private 
14:328:25670:27:28:72:127:626:144:Times:144:Times:coverage.   
14:329:25682:28:28:108:489:598:144:Times:144:Times:To account for the endogeneity of public insurance eligibility, we use the same 
14:330:25762:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:instrumental variables strategy as previous studies on eligibility expansions (Currie and Gruber 
14:331:25859:27:28:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:1996; Cutler and Gruber 1996; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2001; Lo Sasso and Buchmueller 2004; 
14:332:25949:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:Hudson, Selden and Banthin 2005).  Specifically, we instrument for PUBELIG using a simulated 
14:333:26042:27:28:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility measure generated by applying the eligibility rules for each state in each year to a 
14:334:26139:28:28:72:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:nationally representative sample of children.  The instrument is the mean imputed eligibility for 
14:335:26237:28:27:72:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:each state-year-age combination.  Because our model includes state and year fixed effects, 
14:336:26328:27:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:identification comes from variation within states in the timing of SCHIP implementation and the 
14:337:26424:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:extent to which SCHIP raised income eligibility limits.  Additional within-state variation comes 
14:338:26521:27:28:72:456:350:144:Times:144:Times:from the fact that the magnitude of the eligibility changes differed by child age. 
14:339:26604:28:27:108:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:All the variation in eligibility affects children in families with incomes less than 300% of 
14:340:26697:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:the FPL.  Fitting the models to a sample of all children assumes that in the absence of SCHIP, 
14:341:26792:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:trends in insurance coverage for children in the SCHIP “target group” would have been similar 
14:342:26886:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:to children in higher income families, who remained ineligible for public insurance.  Our results 
14:343:26984:27:28:72:490:212:144:Times:144:Times:will be subject to bias if this assumption does not hold.  However, selecting on income 
14:344:27072:28:27:72:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:introduces the potential for endogenous sample selection bias.  Therefore, while we present 
14:345:27164:27:28:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:findings for the sample of children in families with incomes below 300% of the FPL, we also 
14:346:27256:28:28:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:estimate the same models for the full sample of children.  The results for the full sample (which 
14:347:27354:28:0:72:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:we do not report, but are available upon request) are very similar to the lower income sample 
15:348:27450:0:27:72:343:708:144:Times:144:Times:results, lending credibility to our identification strategy.

15:352:27583:28:28:108:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:Before turning to the regression results, we present unadjusted trends in public insurance 
15:353:27674:28:27:72:541:570:144:Times:144:Times:eligibility and insurance coverage in Table 2.  In addition to reporting data for the full samples of 
15:354:27776:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:native and non-native children, we report results for children in families with incomes below the 
15:355:27874:28:27:72:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:poverty line and those with family incomes between 100% and 300% of the FPL.  The latter 
15:356:27963:27:28:71:374:488:144:Times:144:Times:group can be viewed as the target of the SCHIP expansions.     
15:357:28026:28:28:107:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:The full sample results (panel A) show that in 1996, non-native children were 
15:358:28104:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:significantly more likely to be eligible for public health insurance: 44% vs. 27%.  Eligibility 
15:359:28200:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:increased in the next three years.  It leveled off for natives between 1999 and 2000 and fell for 
15:360:28298:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:non-natives.  The latter result is likely caused by a combination of changes in family income and 
15:361:28396:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:sampling error as no states restricted eligibility between 1999 and 2000.  By 2000, 58% of non-
15:362:28491:28:27:72:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:native children and 39% of natives were eligible for either Medicaid or a stand-alone SCHIP 
15:363:28583:27:28:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:program.  However, for both groups, actual public coverage actually fell between 1996 and 1998, 
15:364:28679:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:before increasing modestly by the end of the period.  Private insurance coverage increased by 
15:365:28773:28:27:71:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:roughly 4 percentage points for both groups causing the percentage without insurance to decline 
15:366:28869:27:28:71:119:212:144:Times:144:Times:slightly.   
15:367:28881:28:27:107:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:The data for children in families with incomes below the poverty line (Panel B) suggest 
15:368:28969:27:28:71:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:that that the decline in public insurance coverage between 1996 and 1998 was potentially a result 
15:369:29067:28:28:71:513:129:144:Times:144:Times:of welfare reform, as documented in prior studies (Garrett and Holohan 2000; Kaestner and 
15:370:29157:28:0:71:542:101:144:Times:144:Times:Kaushal 2003; Bitler, Gelbach and Hoynes 2005; Cawley, Schroeder and Simon 2006).  The data 
16:371:29251:0:27:72:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:on eligibility indicate that for the most part these children were not directly affected by the 
16:372:29347:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:SCHIP eligibility expansions: in 1996 over 90% were already eligible for Medicaid.  It has been 
16:373:29443:28:27:71:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:suggested, however, that Medicaid enrollment of already eligible children increased as a result of 
16:374:29542:27:28:72:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:SCHIP outreach efforts.  This may explain why the percentage of poor children with public 
16:375:29632:28:28:71:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:insurance increased after 1998.  Private insurance increased for both groups, with a slightly 
16:376:29726:28:27:72:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:larger change for natives.  The net effect was a reduction in the percent uninsured of between 1 
16:377:29823:27:28:72:195:543:144:Times:144:Times:and 2 percentage points.  
16:378:29849:28:27:108:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:The increase in public insurance eligibility over this period was concentrated among 
16:379:29934:27:28:72:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:children with family incomes between 100 and 300% of the FPL (Panel C).  In 1996, only 13% 
16:380:30025:28:28:72:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:of children in this income range were eligible for Medicaid.  By 2000, nearly half of native 
16:381:30118:28:27:72:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:children and almost three-fifths of non-natives were eligible.  For both groups actual public 
16:382:30212:27:28:72:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:enrollment fell in 1997 but increased thereafter.  The growth in enrollment was stronger for non-
16:383:30309:28:27:72:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:natives (a change of 10 percentage points) than for natives (3 percentage points).  These 
16:384:30399:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:unadjusted figures imply that the marginal take-up rate was roughly three times as large for non-
16:385:30496:28:27:72:504:322:144:Times:144:Times:natives compared to natives: 29.5% vs. 9.5% percent.  However, recall that our eligibility 
16:386:30587:27:28:72:504:295:144:Times:144:Times:measure does not account for the fact that in most states children who already had private 
16:387:30678:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:insurance were not eligible for SCHIP.  We can do a rough adjustment by dividing these figures 
16:388:30773:28:27:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:by the percentage of children without private insurance.  Doing the adjustment based on the 1996 
16:389:30870:27:28:72:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:values implies that 43% of native children (0.095/[1 - 0.776]) and 68% of non-native children 
16:390:30964:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:(0.295/[1- 0.570]) who met income eligibility requirements and did not have private insurance 
16:391:31058:27:28:72:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:took up SCHIP coverage.  There was essentially no change in private coverage among native 
16:392:31148:28:28:72:480:129:144:Times:144:Times:children in this income group and a decline of 1.9 percentage points for non-natives.

17:394:31236:0:27:72:166:708:144:Times:144:Times:Regression Results 
17:395:31255:27:28:108:511:681:144:Times:144:Times: The first set of regression results are reported in Table 3.  Results from our baseline 
17:396:31343:28:27:72:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:model (Equation 1) are reported in columns 1 (natives) and 2 (non-natives).  The results in 
17:397:31435:27:28:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:columns 3 and 4 are from models in which we include state and year interaction terms.  State-
17:398:31528:28:28:72:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:year interactions allow our model to account for very general forms of policy endogeneity, 
17:399:31619:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:enabling us to have greater confidence that the parameter estimates better reflect the underlying 
17:400:31717:27:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:change in Medicaid/SCHIP policy.  However, because there is less policy variation within cells 
17:401:31812:28:27:72:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:defined by state and year, we anticipate larger standard errors.  Because of this trade-off we 
17:402:31907:27:28:72:273:488:144:Times:144:Times:choose to present both sets of estimates.   
17:403:31951:28:28:108:542:460:144:Times:144:Times: In panel A the dependent variable equals one for children who are reported to have public 
17:404:32041:28:27:72:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:insurance coverage and zero for those without public coverage.  For both groups and both 
17:405:32130:27:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:specifications, the coefficient on our eligibility variable is positive and statistically significant.  
17:406:32234:28:27:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:For natives, the estimated coefficient on PUBELIG is .07 in the baseline model and .08 in the 
17:407:32328:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:model with state-year interaction terms.  Contrary to what might have been expected based on 
17:408:32421:28:27:72:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:Currie’s (2000) results, eligibility for public insurance has a larger effect on the public insurance 
17:409:32523:27:28:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:coverage of non-native children.  The PUBELIG coefficient is .103 in column 2 and .123 in 
17:410:32613:28:28:72:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:column 4.  We find a negative but statistically insignificant effect of public eligibility on the 
17:411:32711:28:27:72:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:probability that a child is reported to be covered by private health insurance (Panel B).  The 
17:412:32806:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:effect appears somewhat more negative for non-natives, though as with natives the coefficient is 
17:413:32903:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:not significantly different from zero.  As a result, when the dependent variable equals one for 
17:414:32999:27:28:72:525:157:144:Times:144:Times:children who are uninsured (Panel C), the estimated coefficients on the eligibility variable are 
17:415:33096:28:0:72:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:negative and of a comparable magnitude as the positive coefficients in the take-up model.   
18:416:33189:0:27:108:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:Table 4 presents results from estimates of equation (2), in which the eligibility variable is 
18:417:33283:27:28:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:interacted with the number of months the state requires a child to be uninsured before enrolling 
18:418:33380:28:27:72:529:653:144:Times:144:Times:in SCHIP.  The expectation is that the coefficient on the length of the waiting period should be 
18:419:33477:27:28:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:negative in the take-up regression and positive in the private insurance regression.  This is, in 
18:420:33575:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:fact, what we find for both natives and non-natives.  This indicates that waiting periods have the 
18:421:33674:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:intended effect of reducing crowd-out and, by achieving this goal, reducing public coverage.  In 
18:422:33771:27:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:particular, each additional month in a state’s waiting period reduces take-up by roughly 2 
18:423:33862:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:percentage points for both the native and non-native groups.   The results also imply that if states 
18:424:33963:27:28:72:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:had no waiting period, take-up rates would range from 9% to 13% for natives and 16% to 17% 
18:425:34054:28:28:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:for non-natives, which is considerably higher than the average take-up rates observed in Table 3. 
18:426:34152:28:27:108:512:432:144:Times:144:Times:Table 5 presents results that combine stated private non-group coverage with public 
18:427:34236:27:28:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:coverage to account for the aforementioned potential misclassification problem and private 
18:428:34327:28:27:72:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:group insurance.  Private non-group alone arguably should not be affected by the SCHIP 
18:429:34414:27:28:72:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:expansions—indeed, one might expect non-group coverage to fall as more people with non-
18:430:34501:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:group insurance become eligible for SCHIP.  However, as noted prior work has found that non-
18:431:34593:27:28:72:485:295:144:Times:144:Times:group coverage appears to increase with the implementation of SCHIP (Lo Sasso and 
18:432:34675:28:28:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:Buchmueller 2004), suggesting that respondents in the CPS might not understand that their 
18:433:34765:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:coverage is provided through Medicaid/SCHIP via a private carrier or with a new name that does 
18:434:34860:27:28:72:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:not evoke a state-sponsored program.  Premium requirements for SCHIP in some states might 
18:435:34950:28:27:72:462:184:144:Times:144:Times:also lead to confusion in responding to CPS insurance coverage questions.  Such 
18:436:35030:27:28:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:misinterpretations might be even more common among non-natives as they may lack familiarity 
18:437:35122:28:28:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:with public programs.  The CPS is clearer in asking about private group coverage, specifying the 
18:438:35219:28:0:72:424:101:144:Times:144:Times:need for an employer or union’s sponsorship of the insurance coverage.   
19:439:35294:0:27:108:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:The results in Table 5 indicate that for non-natives there are decreases in private group 
19:440:35384:27:28:71:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:coverage and some evidence of higher public/non-group coverage associated with the SCHIP 
19:441:35473:28:27:71:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:expansions; the results suggest that when accounting for potential reporting errors by non-natives 
19:442:35572:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:public coverage might be 2-3 percentage points higher.  By contrast for natives the differences 
19:443:35668:28:28:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:between the effect of SCHIP on public coverage in Tables 3 and 5 are slight, suggesting little 
19:444:35763:28:27:71:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of misreporting.  In addition, private health insurance substitution might be more of an 
19:445:35861:27:28:71:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:issue for non-natives relative to natives.  Waiting period effects are generally consistent with our 
19:446:35962:28:27:71:143:515:144:Times:144:Times:expectations.   
19:447:35978:27:28:107:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:Implied crowd-out estimates for non-natives range from 7% to 38% without correcting 
19:448:36062:28:28:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:for possible misclassification of non-group coverage and 19% to 57% when correcting estimates 
19:449:36156:28:27:71:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:for potential misclassification.  For natives the estimates range from 13% to 26% without 
19:450:36246:27:28:71:285:405:144:Times:144:Times:correction and 3% to 52% with correction.

19:452:36292:27:28:71:129:350:144:Times:144:Times:Discussion 
19:453:36302:28:27:107:509:322:144:Times:144:Times: While the public insurance expansions of the past two decades have been generally 
19:454:36384:27:28:71:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:successful, a high fraction of eligible children remain uninsured.  Devising strategies to increase 
19:455:36484:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:enrollment among eligible children requires an understanding of how take-up varies within the 
19:456:36578:28:27:71:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:population.  Children of immigrants are a vulnerable group who face special barriers and 
19:457:36667:27:28:71:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:challenges with respect to public insurance enrollment.  Previous research suggests that the 
19:458:36760:28:27:71:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:Medicaid expansions of the late 1980s and early 1990s did little to increase insurance coverage 
19:459:36856:27:28:71:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:or access to care for this group.  In this paper we test for differential impacts of eligibility for the 
19:460:36961:28:28:71:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:State Children’s Health Insurance Program on children of native-born and foreign-born adults.  
19:461:37056:28:0:71:527:101:144:Times:144:Times:Contrary to the prior research, we find significant program take-up for both groups.  This is an 
20:462:37155:0:27:72:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:important result because it implies that outreach efforts embedded in the SCHIP expansion may 
20:463:37249:27:28:72:367:681:144:Times:144:Times:have led to greater success in enrolling non-native children.   
20:464:37313:28:27:108:535:653:144:Times:144:Times: A key feature of most SCHIP programs is the requirement that children be uninsured for 
20:465:37400:27:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:some period of time before enrolling in the program.  For children of both native and non-native 
20:466:37497:28:28:72:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:adults, we find that these waiting periods are effective at reducing the substitution of public 
20:467:37593:28:27:71:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:insurance for private coverage and, by inhibiting such transitions, limit the number of children 
20:468:37690:27:28:72:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:gaining public coverage.  Crowd-out estimates were generally similar between the two groups, 
20:469:37783:28:27:72:405:515:144:Times:144:Times:though they were somewhat sensitive to the modeling assumptions.   
20:470:37850:27:28:108:502:488:144:Times:144:Times:Earlier work on SCHIP indicated that there is some misclassification of insurance 
20:471:37932:28:28:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:coverage in survey data, with some respondents whose children are enrolled in SCHIP plans 
20:472:38022:28:27:72:541:432:144:Times:144:Times:reporting non-group private coverage.  Our results suggest that this classification error is more of 
20:473:38123:27:28:72:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:an issue for non-native families.  This is perhaps not surprising given that non-native families are 
20:474:38224:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:likely to have less familiarity with state programs and the US health insurance system overall.     
20:475:38324:27:28:108:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:Taken together our results suggest that the SCHIP expansions of the late 1990s were 
20:476:38408:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:largely successful in increasing enrollment of the children of non-natives.  This finding suggests 
20:477:38507:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:that SCHIP was a comparative success story with respect to its outreach efforts.  However, more 
20:478:38603:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:work is needed to elucidate what specific aspects of the outreach efforts were most efficacious in 
20:479:38702:28:0:72:432:239:144:Times:144:Times:order to inform policy makers should future expansions be contemplated.
