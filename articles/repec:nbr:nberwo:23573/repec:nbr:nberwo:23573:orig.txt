2:32:1672:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:This  paper  contributes  to  the  debate  on  the  impact  of  juvenile  punishment  on  adult  criminal 
2:33:1778:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:recidivism and  high  school  completion.  We  link  the  universe  of  case  files  of  those  who  were 
2:34:1883:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:convicted of a crime as a juvenile between 1996 and 2012 in a southern U.S. state to the public 
2:35:1978:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:school  administrative  records and  to  adult  criminal  records.  The  detail  of  the  data  allows  us  to 
2:36:2088:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:utilize  information  on  the  exact  types of  crimes  committed,  as  well  as  the  type  and  duration  of 
2:37:2198:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:punishment imposed, both as a juvenile and as an adult. We exploit random assignment of cases 
2:38:2291:14:14:71:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:to judges and use idiosyncratic judge stringency in imprisonment to estimate the causal effect of 
2:39:2388:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration  on  adult  crime  and  on  high  school  completion. Incarceration  has  a  detrimental 
2:40:2490:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:impact  on  high  school  completion  for  earlier  cohorts,  but  it  has  no impact  on  later  cohorts, 
2:41:2596:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:arguably  because  of  the  school  reform  implemented  in  the  state  in  the  late 1990s.  We  find  that 
2:42:2705:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on future violent crime, but it lowers the propensity to 
2:43:2803:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:commit  property  crime.  Juvenile  incarceration  increases  the  propensity  of  being  convicted for  a 
2:44:2909:14:14:71:545:406:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:drug  offense  in  adulthood,  but  this  effect  is  largely  driven  by  time  spent  in  prison  as  a  juvenile. 
2:45:3025:14:14:71:545:392:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:Specifically, juvenile incarceration has no statistically significant impact on adult drug offenses if 
2:46:3127:14:14:71:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:time  spent  in  prison  is  less  than  the  median,  but  longer  incarceration  increases  adult  drug 
2:47:3233:14:42:71:531:364:12:Times:12:Times:conviction, arguably because longer prison stays intensify emotional stress, leading to drug use.

3:62:3640:0:38:57:170:723:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:63:3655:38:27:57:554:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since the seminal work of Becker (1968) and Ehrlich (1973), the fundamental theoretical predictions
3:64:3754:27:27:57:554:658:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the economic model of criminal behavior have been conrmed by a large number of studies.  The
3:65:3850:27:27:57:554:631:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:certainty of punishment, represented by an increased probability of arrests or increased police force, has
3:66:3956:27:27:57:554:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:been shown to exert a signicant deterrent e¤ect on crime. This impact has been documented in a variety
3:67:4059:27:27:57:554:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of empirical designs, using data from di¤erent settings ranging from New York City (Corman and Mocan
3:68:4159:27:28:57:554:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2000) to Buenos Aires (Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004), to London (Draca et al.  2011).  Similarly,
3:69:4258:28:27:57:554:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it has been shown that the severity of punishment has a deterrence e¤ect on criminal propensity. The
3:70:4358:27:27:57:554:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:most commonly used measure of punishment severity is the sentence length received by the o¤ender.
3:71:4455:27:27:57:554:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The analysis of the impact of sentence lengths on criminal proclivity, however, is complicated by the fact
3:72:4561:27:27:57:554:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that longer sentences can reduce crime through two channels. First, longer sentences can decrease crime
3:73:4664:27:27:57:554:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because they incapacitate the o¤enders and thus prevent them from committing new crimes while in
3:74:4760:27:27:57:554:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prison. Second, longer sentences provide a signal to the marginal criminal regarding enhanced sanctions,
3:75:4864:27:27:57:554:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and therefore alter the behavior of potential criminals. This second, deterrence, channel is particularly
3:76:4969:27:27:57:394:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important to identify both from an academic and policy point of view.
3:77:5038:27:27:74:554:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Recently researchers employed creative strategies and novel data sets to identify the deterrent e¤ect
3:78:5139:27:28:57:554:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of prison sentences. For example, Drago et al. (2009) exploited an Italian clemency program as a natural
3:79:5243:28:27:57:554:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:experiment. The program released inmates from prisons but if the released prisoners were to commit a
3:80:5343:27:27:57:554:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime within the ve years of their release, they would serve the residual of the original sentence plus
3:81:5447:27:27:57:554:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sentence of their new crime.1Drago et al. (2009) found support for general deterrence; that is, an
3:82:5549:27:27:57:554:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in the expected sentence reduced recidivism of released inmates. Abrams (2012) used cross-state
3:83:5653:27:27:57:554:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in the timing of the enactment of sentence enhancement laws and found that add-on gun laws,
3:84:5754:27:26:57:554:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that increased the sentence length of crime with guns, generated a ve percent reduction in robberies with
3:85:5860:26:15:70:554:90:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:1That is, one month of the original sentence is transformed into one additional month of sentence to be added to any
3:86:5976:15:0:57:106:75:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:future crime
4:87:5989:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:guns. Similarly, Kuziemko (2013) reported that prison time reduced recidivism of convicted criminals in
4:88:6092:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the state of Georgia. Bhuller et al. (2016) found that in Norway prison time reduced the propensity to
4:89:6194:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:re-o¤end in the future. On the other hand, Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2013) reported that in Argentina
4:90:6296:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prisoners who were assigned to an electronic monitoring system were less likely to recidivate in comparison
4:91:6403:27:28:57:244:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to those who received prison sentences.
4:92:6442:28:27:74:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The di¤erence in the conclusions between studies analyzing prisoners from Argentina (Di Tella and
4:93:6539:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Schargrodsky 2013) and Norway (Bhuller et al. 2016) may be the result of the di¤erential treatment
4:94:6637:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:received by prisoners while incarcerated.  Specically, Bhuller et al.  (2016) argue that the reduced
4:95:6738:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:propensity to re-o¤end after the release from prison in Norway is due to the rehabilitation of inmates
4:96:6840:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:while they were in prison. Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2013), on the other hand, explain that the prison
4:97:6943:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditions in Argentina are arguably among the worst in the world and that those prisoners who stay
4:98:7042:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in prison are exposed to rough conditions. Inmates have ample opportunity to learn from each other to
4:99:7143:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enhance their criminal skills and they become hardened criminals when they leave the prison. This can
4:100:7244:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explain the higher re-o¤ending rates of these who are imprisoned in comparison to those who wear an
4:101:7343:27:28:57:382:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:electronic monitoring bracelet without entering prison in Argentina.
4:102:7411:28:27:74:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The argument about the possibility of incarcerated individuals enhancing their criminal human capital
4:103:7512:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:while in prison, thus becoming more skilled criminals upon leaving the prison is formalized by Mocan
4:104:7612:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:et al. (2005). The potential for enhancement of criminal human capital while in prison is even more
4:105:7711:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important for juveniles. Bayer et al. (2009) provide evidence on this point, as they report that juvenile
4:106:7816:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:o¤enders in Florida are inuenced by their peers while serving time in prison. Similarly, Aizer and Doyle
4:107:7921:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2015) analyze juvenile delinquents in Chicago/Cook County and nd that incarceration as a juvenile
4:108:8020:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leads to a reduced propensity to complete high school and enhanced probability of serving time in an
4:109:8120:27:27:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adult correctional facility, suggesting that criminogenic e¤ects of juvenile imprisonment may outweigh its
4:110:8226:27:27:57:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deterrence e¤ect. In contrast, Hjalmarsson (2009) analyzed data on adjudicated or convicted juveniles
4:111:8327:27:0:57:554:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the state of Washington and reported that incarceration in juvenile facilities reduced recidivism and
5:112:8434:0:27:57:435:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that this deterrence e¤ect was observed for a variety of sub-groups of juveniles.
5:113:8515:27:27:74:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our paper makes contributions to the debate on the impact of juvenile punishment on adult crime in
5:114:8613:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:di¤erent ways. First, we bring together a number of important research design attributes employed by
5:115:8713:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous work. For example, similar to Hjalmarsson (2009), we analyze the administrative records of an
5:116:8815:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:entire state, rather than one jurisdiction in the U.S. Specically, we analyze the universe of juveniles who
5:117:8923:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were incarcerated in the state of Louisiana between 1996 and 2004. To address the potential endogeneity
5:118:9026:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of juvenile incarceration, we exploit random assignment of defendants to judges and construct an indicator
5:119:9132:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of judge stringency in incarceration, which is employed as an instrument of juvenile incarceration (Aizer
5:120:9237:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Doyle 2015 and Bhuller et al. 2016).2Under certain assumptions, this estimation strategy generates
5:121:9339:27:27:57:391:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Local Average Treatment E¤ect (LATE) of juvenile incarceration.
5:122:9406:27:27:74:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We link the case les in the juvenile justice system to public school records and adult incarceration
5:123:9507:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:records of the state of Louisiana to observe juvenile o¤enders educational attainment (high school com-
5:124:9611:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pletion) and their future criminal activity (adult criminal conviction). The detail of our data set provides
5:125:9719:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:information not only on the types of crimes these individuals committed as a juvenile, but also on the
5:126:9821:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:types of crimes they committed as an adult. This aspect of our data, which was also available in the data
5:127:9926:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:used by Aizer and Doyle (2015), but not in those employed by Bhuller et al. (2016), generates important
5:128:10029:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insights into the di¤erential e¤ect of juvenile punishment on adult crime, which has not been noticed by
5:129:10133:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous research. Specically, we show that juvenile punishment has heterogeneous impacts on various
5:130:10234:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:types of adult crimes.  We nd that having been incarcerated as a juvenile has no impact on future
5:131:10332:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:violent crime, but it has a deterrent e¤ect on future property crime. On the other hand, incarceration as
5:132:10437:27:27:57:466:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a juvenile increases the propensity of being convicted for a drug o¤ense in adulthood.
5:133:10523:27:27:74:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A key component which has been missing from data sets employed by previous research is information
5:134:10621:27:27:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on time spent in prison as a juvenile. Another contribution of our paper is the ability to have access
5:135:10723:27:27:57:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to information not only on juvenile o¤enders sentence type (incarceration or probation) but also on
5:136:10823:27:15:70:554:73:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2Using a similar identication strategy and in a related context, Dobbie et al. (2017) examine the e¤ects of pre-trial
5:137:10941:15:0:57:306:58:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:detention on the probability of future crime and employment.
6:138:11002:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual amount of time served in prison. This information allows us to conduct a detailed analysis of the
6:139:11106:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact of the extensive and intensive margins of punishment (the impact of having been sentenced to
6:140:11205:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:go to prison, as well as time served in prison) on future criminal activity. This investigation generates
6:141:11310:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interesting insights, and points to a particular mechanism regarding re-o¤ending. For example, we nd
6:142:11411:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence that the positive impact of juvenile imprisonment on adult drug conviction is largely driven by
6:143:11515:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time spent in prison as a juvenile. Juvenile incarceration has no statistically signicant impact on adult
6:144:11621:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:drug o¤enses if time spent in prison is less than the median time (209 days), but that longer incarceration
6:145:11728:27:27:57:500:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:signicantly increases adult drug conviction and the estimated impact is considerably larger.
6:146:11821:27:27:74:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Another advantage of our data set is that it contains information on sentence types assigned to
6:147:11916:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adult convictions in the form of probation versus incarceration. This information allows us to infer the
6:148:12020:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seriousness of adult drug convictions. For example, using this information we determine that most drug
6:149:12122:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:convictions are related to drug use rather than drug sales or drug tra¢cking because the overwhelming
6:150:12223:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:majority of those who are convicted of drug charges as adults are put on probation, rather than being
6:151:12324:27:27:57:118:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarcerated.
6:152:12337:27:28:74:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given that the positive impact of juvenile punishment does not exist for any crime category other
6:153:12434:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than drug convictions, and that the overwhelming majority of adult drug convictions are related to drug
6:154:12537:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:use rather than drug sales or tra¢cking (because they receive probation, rather than prison time), these
6:155:12641:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results arguably suggest that longer time spent in prison in youth leads to adult drug o¤enses because of
6:156:12746:27:27:57:294:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the emotional stress endured in long prison stays.
6:157:12796:27:27:74:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When we analyze the impact of juvenile incarceration on high school completion we nd that while
6:158:12892:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration had a detrimental impact on high school completion propensity in cohorts born before 1983,
6:159:12996:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it has no impact on later cohorts (younger students), arguably because of the school reforms implemented
6:160:13100:27:27:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Louisiana made it more di¢cult to obtain a high school diploma. The Louisiana School and District
6:161:13200:27:27:57:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Accountability system was adopted by the states Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in
6:162:13295:27:0:57:554:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:June 1998.  The state identied 10- and 20-year goals for all public schools and required schools to
7:163:13396:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demonstrate progress toward these goals with the intent of improving educational outcomes (Eren and
7:164:13495:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Depew 2016).  As part of this new accountability system, students are required to pass standardized
7:165:13594:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tests known as Graduation Exit Exam (GEE) in core subjects beginning with the 2000-2001 academic
7:166:13690:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:year. Students who do not meet the minimum requirements in all portions of the high school exam are
7:167:13789:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not able to obtain a high school diploma. Although the existing evidence is far from being conclusive,
7:168:13891:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a number of studies found adverse e¤ects of similar high school exit exams on graduation rates, in
7:169:13989:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (see, for example, Dee and Jacob 2007). The
7:170:14087:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graduation rates of the non-incarcerated are historically higher than the graduation rates of those who
7:171:14190:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have been incarcerated. We provide suggestive evidence that GEE (and therefore, the new accountability
7:172:14292:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system) has disproportionally impacted non-incarcerated delinquents without any meaningful e¤ect on
7:173:14391:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarcerated juveniles. Put di¤erently, our analyses suggest that the increased graduation standards have
7:174:14496:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not inuenced those who were incarcerated (the graduation rates of whom were already low), but that
7:175:14595:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these new standards have reduced the graduation rates of the non-incarcerated. This implies that the
7:176:14695:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gap in the graduation rates between these two groups has been narrowed and became indistinguishable
7:177:14794:27:28:57:267:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from zero after the implementation of GEE.
7:178:14836:28:27:74:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the juvenile justice system in Louisiana, and
7:179:14936:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the empirical methodology and the instrument. Section
7:180:15038:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5 presents the results, provides robustness analyses and various extensions, including the analysis of high
7:181:15145:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school completion. Section 6 presents the conclusions and puts our ndings in context of other evidence

7:184:15332:38:27:57:554:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Louisiana, youth through age 17 may enter the juvenile justice system when they are accused of
7:185:15429:27:27:57:554:91:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:committing a crime and arrested or referred by the police to a juvenile court. Having received a formal
7:186:15532:27:0:57:554:64:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:complaint from a local law o¢cer, the District Attorneys (DA) O¢ce must decide whether or not to
8:187:15630:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:petition the case to the court. Prosecutors may choose not to do so because of lack of su¢cient evidence.
8:188:15735:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Alternatively, to prevent incarceration, the DAs O¢ce may choose to enter into an informal agreement
8:189:15836:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(diversion program) with the juvenile and the parents which occasionally entails a child to participate
8:190:15939:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in community service, restitution, or treatment and comply with certain behavioral requirements such
8:191:16039:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as school attendance (Louisiana Childrens Code CHC 631). Finally, prosecutors may proceed with a
8:192:16136:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:petition. When the case moves to adjudication, the disposition must be determined by a judge (Louisiana
8:193:16239:27:27:57:209:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Childrens Code CHC 650-675).
8:194:16268:27:27:74:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under the provisions of the Louisiana juvenile justice system, a computer generated random allotment
8:195:16368:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(open to public) is implemented on a daily basis by the Clerks o¢ce for all rst time case les led in
8:196:16472:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each district court.3Therefore, random assignment to judges within each district court is true for rst
8:197:16575:27:27:57:524:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time juvenile o¤enders. Repeat o¤enders are reassigned to the judge who handled the initial case.
8:198:16672:27:27:74:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Judges may simply dismiss the case if the prosecutor is unable to provide evidence to nd the youth
8:199:16771:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:delinquent. The defendant would then be found not guilty and does not enter into the juvenile justice
8:200:16872:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system. If the judge nds the defendant guilty, the judge has to make a disposition decision. Disposed
8:201:16974:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:youth is either assigned to the custody of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections to be conned
8:202:17078:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in secure placement (incarcerated) or placed in a non-secure facility or on probation. Non-secure facilities
8:203:17186:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were established for youth that encountered problems at home and have nowhere else to go, and they
8:204:17284:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generally include foster care, group homes and short and long-term treatment facilities. The judges have
8:205:17388:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to also assign a disposition length (sentence length) regardless of the disposition type.4In other words,
8:206:17493:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each convicted juvenile is assigned a sentence length irrespective of whether they are placed under secure
8:207:17599:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:custody, non-secure custody, or probation. Additional details of the court procedures are provided in

9:214:18137:38:27:57:554:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The data for this study are compiled from three di¤erent sources. The rst one is the Louisiana Depart-

9:216:18343:27:27:57:554:631:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we obtained access to the universe of case records from 1996 to 2012 that contain information on juve-
9:217:18445:27:27:57:554:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:niles who were found guilty. For each case record, we have information on both the juvenile o¤ender and
9:218:18548:27:27:57:554:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the case itself. Information on juveniles includes basic demographics (e.g., race, gender, and age). The
9:219:18652:27:28:57:554:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:case les also contain the exact statute o¤ense committed, the date the juvenile was disposed before the
9:220:18756:28:27:57:554:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:judge, the judges disposition type (e.g. whether the juvenile was incarcerated), disposition length, and
9:221:18861:27:27:57:250:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the court in which the hearing was held.
9:222:18901:27:27:74:554:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our adult crime data come from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Adult
9:223:18996:27:27:57:554:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Services and they cover the period from 1996 to 2012.  Similar to juvenile o¤ender les, adult crime
9:224:19096:27:27:57:554:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data include basic demographic information, the exact type of crime committed and sentence type (i.e.,
9:225:19198:27:27:57:554:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration or probation). Finally, to obtain high school completion status of the juveniles, we utilize
9:226:19304:27:27:57:554:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the administrative records from the Louisiana Department of Education over the same period. Using a

9:228:19509:27:27:57:145:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between data sets.
9:229:19527:27:28:74:554:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our rst outcome of interest is adult conviction at age 25 or earlier. In order to measure criminal
9:230:19626:28:27:57:554:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recidivism without any censoring, we limit our focus to juvenile case les from 1996 to 2004, corresponding
9:231:19733:27:27:57:554:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the cohorts born between 1979 to 1987. Put di¤erently, we focus on the universe of convicted juveniles
9:232:19838:27:27:57:554:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who were born between 1979 and 1987, and follow them until each one reaches the age of 25 to observe

9:234:20044:27:27:57:554:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime by age 25 and focus on the same cohort of convicted juveniles (who were born between 1979 and
9:235:20144:27:27:57:554:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1987) but follow them until the year 2012 to observe their criminal convictions until 2012. In this second
9:236:20250:27:27:57:554:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:set-up, we analyze the same group of juveniles, but the age in which the adult crime is committed can
9:237:20351:27:0:57:137:62:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be as high as 33.
10:238:20369:0:27:74:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The case les of juveniles are randomly assigned to judges, except for repeat o¤enders whose cases
10:239:20467:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are handled by the original judge. Thus, we focus on o¤enders who had only one interaction with the
10:240:20566:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile justice system. Put di¤erently, to ensure random assignment of case les to judges, we include
10:241:20669:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only one-time juvenile o¤enders in the e¤ective sample.5Although it is not a common occurrence,
10:242:20764:27:28:57:553:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juveniles may have committed multiple o¤enses. For those cases, we consider the most severe decision
10:243:20864:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:among all convictions as their disposition outcome.6As detailed below, because we control for court-
10:244:20964:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by-year xed e¤ects (which is the unit of randomization) we restrict the sample to the dispositions from
10:245:21068:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those courts that had at least two regular judges in a given year. Finally, we exclude individuals whose
10:246:21172:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disposition judge has handled fewer than 25 juvenile case les over the entire sample period. Doing so
10:247:21274:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alleviates concerns pertaining to noise in the construction of judge stringency measure. Having imposed
10:248:21377:27:27:57:382:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these restrictions, we end up with a total of 7,396 juvenile case les.
10:249:21448:27:27:74:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics. The average juvenile incarceration rate, shown in column
10:250:21549:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1) is about 25 percent, indicating that roughly one-in-four convicted juveniles serve time in secure
10:251:21650:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:custody. This rate is slightly higher than the national average (21 percent in 2005) among all adjudicated
10:252:21756:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:delinquent cases (Puzzanchera and Sickmund 2008). Black juveniles comprise 65 percent of all juvenile
10:253:21857:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:delinquents; white juveniles make up about one-third of all juvenile convictions, and one-in-four juvenile
10:254:21963:27:27:57:359:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:delinquent is female. The average age at conviction is 15 years.
10:255:22027:27:27:74:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As shown in Panel A of Table 1, property and drug related juvenile o¤enses together make up half of
10:256:22126:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:all juvenile convictions. About 20 percent of juvenile property crime convictions is for burglary o¤enses,
10:257:22232:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and about 38 percent is for various types of theft. About 41 percent of violent crime juvenile convictions
10:258:22338:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is for aggravated battery or aggravated assault, and 23 percent is for robbery or armed robbery. Seventy-
10:259:22443:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:eight percent of drug convictions falls under the category of possession, manufacturing, distribution of
10:260:22547:27:26:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:drugs and about 18 percent are for possession of marijuana. Other crimes are a heterogeneous group,
10:261:22646:26:15:70:554:101:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:5Although all rst time case les are randomly assigned to judges, keeping the initial les for repeat juvenile o¤enders may
10:262:22770:15:11:57:554:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:still contaminate the e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on adult outcomes. For example, a juvenile who was not incarcerated
10:263:22891:11:7:57:406:75:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:for the rst o¤ense may be placed in a secure facility for a subsequent juvenile o¤ense.
10:264:22979:7:0:70:390:68:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:6Eight percent of our e¤ective sample has committed multiple juvenile o¤enses.
11:265:23058:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the most common categories of which include: ungovernable (18 percent), simple battery (18 percent),
11:266:23158:27:27:57:534:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:truancy (15 percent), disturbing the peace (11 percent) and carrying a weapon illegally (4 percent).
11:267:23258:27:27:74:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As shown in Panel B of Table 1, about 39 percent juvenile delinquents are convicted as adults by age
11:268:23358:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:25. About 18 percent recidivates with a drug-related crime, 15 percent with a property crime, 7.1 percent
11:269:23463:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with a violent crime, and 3.5 percent with other crimes.7Because an individual may have been convicted
11:270:23565:28:27:57:553:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for more than one adult crime, the sum of the adult recidivism rates of individual crime categories is
11:271:23667:27:27:57:499:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater than the overall recidivism rate. The age at (rst-time) adult conviction is about 20.
11:272:23761:27:27:74:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We treat an individual as a high school graduate if the public records over the sample period indicate
11:273:23863:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graduation from high school in Louisiana. About 24 percent of those who are convicted of a crime as a
11:274:23964:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile in Louisiana have subsequently graduated from high school. This graduation rate is substantially
11:275:24069:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher than the 12 percent rate reported for Chicago/Cook County in Aizer and Doyle (2015) who
11:276:24163:27:27:57:303:425:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:analyzed the cohorts born between 1971 and 1983.8
11:277:24212:27:27:74:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Of the 7,396 juveniles who are convicted of a crime, 1,822 are incarcerated in secure custody. Column
11:278:24313:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(3) in Panel A of Table 1 shows that incarcerated juveniles are more likely to be black and male. Forty
11:279:24416:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percent of the incarcerated juveniles are convicted of property crimes. As columns (3) and (5) of Panel B
11:280:24521:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demonstrate, incarcerated juveniles are more likely to recidivate as an adult in comparison to those who
11:281:24625:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are placed on probation or placed in non-secure custody. Adult conviction rate is 54.6 percent among
11:282:24725:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those who are incarcerated as a juvenile, but the rate is 33.3 percent for the non-incarcerated juvenile
11:283:24829:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:delinquents. Finally, high school graduation rate for those who are incarcerated as a juvenile is lower
11:284:24932:27:27:57:301:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than those who are convicted but not incarcerated.
11:285:24982:27:27:74:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We should note that potential attrition due to migration is unlikely to be an issue in this setting.
11:286:25082:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Analyzing the American Community Survey data (2003 and 2004), we nd that only 4.8 percent of
11:287:25175:27:14:70:554:127:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:7This last category (other crimes) includes all other o¤enses, ranging from jury misconduct to criminal trespass, from hit

11:290:25450:14:11:57:554:91:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:School System. Thus, any transfers out the school district are coded as non-graduate. Unlike Aizer and Doyle (2015), we can
11:291:25573:11:11:57:554:80:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:track individuals as long as they do not move out of the state or transfer to a private school. Among others, state-specic

11:293:25823:11:0:57:448:58:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:contribute to uncovering the large discrepancy in the graduation rates in Louisiana and Chicago.

12:314:27590:27:27:74:554:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To address the potential endogeneity of juvenile incarceration, we construct a measure of judge strin-
12:315:27692:27:0:57:554:66:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gency, and employ this measure as an instrument for the juveniles propensity for being incarcerated
13:316:27794:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:following his/her juvenile conviction (Aizer and Doyle 2015 and Bhuller et al. 2016). More specically,
13:317:27897:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we exploit the fact that juvenile court judges have discretion in sentencing, that they di¤er in their
13:318:27999:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:harshness in assigning punishment to juveniles, and that juvenile defenders are randomly assigned to
13:319:28099:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:judges. Thus, we can investigate the impact of sentence severity of a juvenile on his/her propensity to
13:320:28202:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:commit crime as an adult, using the idiosyncratic proclivity of a judge to incarcerate as an instrument

13:325:28557:34:27:57:554:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To create the instrument we use all past and future juvenile case les handled by each judge over the period

13:327:28763:27:27:57:554:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per judge is 478. Once the juvenile is convicted of the crime, the judge makes a decision regarding the
13:328:28866:27:27:57:554:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disposition type. As detailed in the previous section, the disposition type is either incarceration in secure
13:329:28975:27:28:57:301:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:custody (prison), non-secure custody, or probation.

13:345:29491:27:26:57:554:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:case les to judges. This crucial assumption calls for controlling the unit of randomization in all rst and
13:346:29599:26:15:70:554:115:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:9Under certain assumptions (discussed below), one can interpret any di¤erences in adult conviction for juvenile o¤enders

14:357:30803:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in the data. For example, moving from the least stringent judge to the most stringent raises

14:360:31108:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the same courthouse. The rst juvenile may be up to 29 percentage points more likely to go to prison

14:373:32216:27:0:57:507:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in incarceration, indicating that the instrument is strongly related to the endogenous variable.

15:375:32338:34:27:57:554:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:AlthoughJS in Incarcerationj(i)is a strong predictor of juvenile incarceration, there are three additional
15:376:32444:27:27:57:554:662:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditions that must be met for us to interpret the coe¢cient estimate from an IV specication as the
15:377:32545:27:43:57:208:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LATE of juvenile incarceration.
15:378:32576:43:27:57:554:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Conditional IndependenceThe rst assumption is that of independence; i.e. the instrument must
15:379:32669:27:27:57:554:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be uncorrelated with the error term in the outcome equation. Under random assignment of juvenile case
15:380:32770:27:27:57:554:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:les to judges, this condition is likely to hold. A typical test for this is to run a series of regressions of
15:381:32880:27:27:57:554:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile/case characteristics on judge stringency, while controlling for court-by-year xed e¤ects. These
15:382:32985:27:27:57:554:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:randomization test results are reported in Table 3.  Each cell represents a separate regression.  The
15:383:33086:27:27:57:554:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coe¢cient estimates on judge stringency are very small in all regressions, and with one exception, none
15:384:33189:27:27:57:554:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of them is statistically di¤erent from zero. Thus, the evidence presented here coupled with the fact that
15:385:33294:27:28:57:554:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the coe¢cient of judge stringency in incarceration in the rst-stage regressions of Table 2 are insensitive

15:387:33504:27:27:57:554:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption. We also run similar regressions using the incarceration indicator as the outcome of interest
15:388:33608:27:27:57:554:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and nd almost all individual and case characteristics to be strong predictors of juvenile incarceration.

15:390:33754:42:27:57:554:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Exclusion RestrictionIn our design, estimating equation (1) using instrumental variables assumes
15:391:33850:27:27:57:554:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the instrument,JS in Incarcerationj(i), which represents the propensity of a judge to incarcerate the
15:392:33956:27:27:57:553:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile defendant, has an impact on an outcome (e.g. recidivism, or high school completion) only through
15:393:34061:27:28:57:554:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the incarceration channel. In other words, it is assumed that the stringency of the judge in incarceration
15:394:34167:28:27:57:554:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has no direct impact on the outcome, nor does it impact the outcome through some other channel. But,
15:395:34267:27:27:57:554:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarcerated juveniles spend time in prison, and it could be the case that more stringent judges are not
15:396:34371:27:27:57:554:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only more likely to incarcerate, but they are also more likely to assign longer prison sentences. If this is
15:397:34479:27:0:57:554:62:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the case, the instrument (JS in Incarcerationj(i), shown in equation 2), would impact two components
16:398:34581:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:related to juveniles punishment: (i) whether or not the juvenile gets incarcerated, and (ii) the length of
16:399:34688:27:27:57:553:696:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:time spent in prison, given incarceration. In this case, the exclusion restriction would be invalidated.10
16:400:34794:27:49:57:300:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:More generally, consider the following specication

16:404:35119:27:28:57:554:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on how long that person was incarcerated (T ime Spent inPrison). Put di¤erently, both the extensive
16:405:35218:28:27:57:554:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and intensive margins of incarceration experience are assumed to impact the outcomeYi. This formulation
16:406:35321:27:27:57:554:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:calls for two instruments: one for incarceration, the other for time spent in prison. The detail of our data
16:407:35429:27:27:57:554:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allows us to generate these two instruments. As discussed earlier, the instrument for incarceration is the

17:451:37306:27:27:57:554:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First, even though all convicted juveniles are assigned a sentence length by judges, about three-quarters

17:453:37519:27:27:57:554:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and therefore there is no relationship between assigned sentence length and actual time in prison. The
17:454:37621:27:27:57:554:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:remaining group serves time in prison, but even in this case, actual time spent in prison is less than the
17:455:37727:27:27:57:554:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sentence assigned by the judge for a number of di¤erent reasons such as early release or being placed on
17:456:37831:27:27:57:89:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:parole.
17:457:37838:27:28:74:554:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Thus, we focus on equations (1)-(3) to identify the impact of incarceration, using judge stringency in
17:458:37940:28:27:57:554:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration as an instrument. Of course, the question that needs to be addressed is whether the exclusion
17:459:38047:27:27:57:554:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:restriction holds in this specication. In other words, does the instrument (JS in Incarcerationj(i)) have
17:460:38153:27:27:57:554:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:animpact on the outcomeYithrough another channel, perhaps through its impact on time served in
17:461:38247:27:27:57:91:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prison?
17:462:38254:27:27:74:554:97:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We show that this is not the case. Consider the regression results reported in Table 4. The rst column
17:463:38357:27:0:57:554:70:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reports the results of the regression obtained from the full sample. The dependent variable is time served
18:464:38465:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in prison. The average time in prison is 88 days because the sample consists of all convicted juveniles,
18:465:38569:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:including those who are not incarcerated, for whom time served in prison is zero. The coe¢cient of judge
18:466:38673:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stringency in incarceration is positive and signicant, but this is misleading because this relationship is
18:467:38780:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:driven by the decision of judges on the incarceration margin. Column 2 presents the same regression for
18:468:38883:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those who are incarcerated. Here the coe¢cient of judges propensity to incarcerate has no impact on
18:469:38983:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:actual time served in prison for those who went to prison. To make this point more clearly, the regression
18:470:39089:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in column (3) of Table 4 uses the entire sample and explains time spent in prison by both the judges
18:471:39190:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration propensity and whether or not the person was incarcerated as a juvenile. The results show
18:472:39293:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that having been incarcerated as a juvenile increases time in prison by 343 days (in the sample of 7,396
18:473:39397:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals, 75 percent of whom have not been incarcerated), but that judge stringency in incarceration
18:474:39500:27:27:57:515:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has no direct impact on time in prison (the coe¢cient is 0.899 with and standard error of 1.05).
18:475:39596:27:27:74:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This means that the length of time the juvenile stayed in prison is not impacted by the extent of
18:476:39693:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the harshness of the relevant judges incarceration propensity. Put di¤erently, the instrument does not
18:477:39796:27:27:57:372:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inuence the outcome through its impact on time spent in prison.
18:478:39860:27:28:74:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Another plausible test for the validity of the exclusion restriction condition comes from exploring
18:479:39959:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the association between judge stringency and the decision to plead guilty. Juvenile defendants can plea
18:480:40062:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bargain with the district attorney and they can choose to plead guilty to the charges before going in front
18:481:40169:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the judge to get adjudicated. In the data we can identify those who plead guilty.11This allows us to
18:482:40272:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analyze whether judge stringency has an impact on the extent to which a juvenile takes a plea bargain
18:483:40373:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the district attorney. We ran equation (3) by using as the dependent variable a dummy to indicate
18:484:40475:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if the juvenile accepted the charge before going to the adjudication hearing. The estimated coe¢cient of
18:485:40579:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:JS in Incarcerationis 0.177 (se=0.132), indicating the harshness of the judge in his/her incarceration
18:486:40681:27:14:66:554:127:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:11Before the adjudication hearing where the judge make decision on guilt-vs-innocence, a petition hearing takes place. At
18:487:40802:14:11:57:554:113:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:this petition hearing the district attorney charges the juvenile with a crime. If the defendant pleads not guilty, the case goes
18:488:40930:11:11:57:554:102:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:to the trials, which takes place at a later date. In this case, the date of the adjudication hearing is later than the date of
18:489:41056:11:11:57:554:91:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the petition hearing. If, on the other hand, the petition and adjudication dates are the same, this means that the judge has
18:490:41180:11:0:57:505:80:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:not made a guilty/not guilty decision; instead, the juvenile has pleaded guilty or no contest to the charge led.
19:491:41295:0:42:57:388:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:propensity has no impact on the juveniles likelihood to plea bargain.
19:492:41365:42:28:57:554:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:MonotonicityFinally, in order to treat our point estimates as LATE from IV regressions, monotonicity
19:493:41465:28:27:57:554:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has to be assumed. This assumption requires individuals who are incarcerated by a strict judge would also
19:494:41570:27:27:57:554:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be incarcerated by a more lenient judge, and those who are not incarcerated by a strict judge wouldnt
19:495:41672:27:27:57:554:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be incarcerated by a lenient judge either. An easily testable implication of monotonicity is that the point
19:496:41779:27:27:57:554:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates from the rst-stage regression (equation 3) must be non-negative for all subsamples. Panel A of
19:497:41884:27:27:57:554:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix provides several rst stage results by juvenile and case characteristics.
19:498:41990:27:27:57:493:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The estimated coe¢cients of judge stringency are positive and signicant for all subgroups.
19:499:42081:27:27:74:554:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Another testable implication of monotonicity is that judges who are more strict for one group (e.g.
19:500:42180:27:27:57:554:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:felony crimes) should also be strict for another group (e.g. misdemeanors). To check this, we follow
19:501:42280:27:27:57:554:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bhuller et al. (2016) and dene the instrument for each subsample to be the mean incarceration rate
19:502:42379:27:27:57:554:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the judge from case les outside of the subsample. Once again, under monotonicity, one expects the
19:503:42480:27:28:57:554:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rst stage result for each subsample using this reverse sample instrument to be positive. As presented in
19:504:42585:28:27:57:554:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Panel B of Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix, this is indeed the case. We also relax the monotonicity
19:505:42685:27:27:57:554:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption by recalculating the judge stringency (i.e., the leave-out mean incarceration rate of the judge)
19:506:42792:27:27:57:554:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by o¤ense severity (e.g., felony vs. non-felony). As shown in the Robustness Section, the results remain
19:507:42896:27:52:57:88:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intact.
19:508:42903:52:39:57:133:222:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5  Results
19:509:42913:39:34:57:184:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.1  Baseline Results
19:510:42934:34:27:57:554:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We rst present the results, obtained by estimating equation (1) using OLS. The estimates, shown in Table
19:511:43039:27:27:57:554:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5, are based on two di¤erent specications. Column (1) provides OLS estimates of the impact of juvenile
19:512:43142:27:27:57:554:95:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration controlling for court-by-year xed e¤ects and juvenile characteristics.  Column (2) adds
19:513:43244:27:0:57:554:68:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detailed juvenile o¤ense xed e¤ects. The point estimate in column (2) indicates a statistically signicant
20:514:43353:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:12 percentage point increase in adult recidivism for those who were incarcerated as juveniles. Panels (B)
20:515:43458:27:27:57:553:696:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:through (D) report the same e¤ect by type of adult crime, and reveal no signicant heterogeneity.12
20:516:43557:27:27:57:553:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The coe¢cient estimates are positive and signicantly di¤erent for drugo¤enses, for violent crimes, as
20:517:43659:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well as for property crimes. These results, however, are likely to be biased as there are several potential
20:518:43766:27:28:57:417:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unobserved factors a¤ecting both adult conviction and youth incarceration.
20:519:43840:28:27:74:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To address potential endogeneity of youth incarceration, we estimate the same models within the
20:520:43935:27:27:57:553:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:framework of equations (1) and (2); instrumenting youth incarceration withJS in Incarceration. The
20:521:44033:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results are radically di¤erent from those obtained from OLS. The results in Panel A of Table 6 show that
20:522:44137:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the impact of juvenile incarceration on adult crime is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
20:523:44244:27:27:74:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specically, columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 show if the person was convicted of a crime and was
20:524:44339:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarcerated as a juvenile (due to having faced a tough judge) he/she is only one percentage point more
20:525:44442:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:likely to get convicted of a crime as an adult (in comparison to a juvenile who was also convicted but
20:526:44544:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not incarcerated). This small e¤ect, however, is not statistically di¤erent from zero. Thus, the IV results
20:527:44651:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Panel (A) of Table 6 reveal that juvenile incarceration has no statistically signicant impact on adult
20:528:44757:27:28:57:463:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime when the dependent variable does not make a distinction between crime types.
20:529:44839:28:27:74:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Panels B, C and D of Table 6 reveal that this null-e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on adult crime
20:530:44938:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:emerges because juvenile incarceration has di¤erential e¤ects on di¤erent types of adult crime.  For
20:531:45038:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:example, columns (1) and (2) of Panel B report the results of the IV regressions where the dependent
20:532:45138:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable is conviction of a drug crime as an adult. Juvenile incarceration increases the probability of
20:533:45241:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adult conviction of a drug o¤ense by 27 percentage points. Panel C shows that juvenile incarceration has
20:534:45345:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:no impact on the probability of conviction for a violent crime as an adult. On the other hand, as shown
20:535:45448:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Panel D, juvenile incarceration reduces the propensity for recidivism in adulthood in case of property
20:536:45553:27:24:57:90:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crimes.
20:537:45560:24:15:66:554:103:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:12We do not analyze crimes that are not classied as a drug crime,property crime, or violent crime.  These residual
20:538:45675:15:11:57:554:88:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:crimes constitute a small fraction of all adult crime in the data (3.5 percent of all adult convictions). As noted, they are a
20:539:45801:11:11:57:554:77:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:highly heterogeneous group, including crimes ranging from jury misconduct to criminal trespass, from hit and run driving
20:540:45921:11:0:57:140:66:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:to aggravated incest.
21:541:45944:0:27:74:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In summary, juvenile incarceration, triggered by exposure to a harsher juvenile judge, has a deterrent
21:542:46046:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¤ect on adult property crime commission, it has a positive impact on committing a drug o¤ense as
21:543:46143:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an adult, and has no e¤ect on adult violent crime. Consistent with the strong rst-stage relationship
21:544:46244:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reported in Table 2, the reduced-form regressions reported in the last column of Table 6 show that the
21:545:46346:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stringency in incarceration of the juvenile court judge has a signicant negative impact on adult property
21:546:46452:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime, and a positive e¤ect on adult drug crime. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority
21:547:46555:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of adult drug crimes are related to drug use, rather than drug selling. This is because about 95 percent
21:548:46659:27:43:57:536:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of all adult drug convictions receive a suspended sentence or probation, as opposed to incarceration.
21:549:46760:43:34:57:200:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.2  Robustness Checks
21:550:46782:34:27:57:554:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We undertake several sensitivity checks to examine the robustness of our results. First, we redene our
21:551:46885:27:27:57:554:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outcome of interest to take the value of one if an individual was convicted of a crime as adult by any
21:552:46987:27:27:57:554:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:age, instead of 25 or earlier. Doing so does not alter the results (Column 1, Table 7). Second, recall that
21:553:47094:27:27:57:554:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we limit our e¤ective sample to include juvenile o¤enders whose judge had handled at least 25 case les
21:554:47197:27:28:57:554:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:over the period from 1996 to 2012. Relaxing this restriction and including judges with at least 15 case
21:555:47300:28:27:57:554:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:les has little impact on our results (Column 2). Similarly, further restricting the sample to judges who
21:556:47405:27:27:57:537:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:handled 250 or more case les does not alter the point estimates appreciably (Column 3 of Table 7).

21:558:47605:27:27:57:554:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 2012. In column (4) of Table 7, we recalculate the leave-out mean incarceration rate of judges using the
21:559:47712:27:27:57:554:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:case les which only appear in our juvenile sample period (1996-2004). The estimated e¤ects on juvenile
21:560:47815:27:27:57:554:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration remain intact. Finally, we also construct the measure of judge stringency that is allowed
21:561:47918:27:27:57:554:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to di¤er by juvenile o¤ense severity (e.g., felony vs. non-felony). Our ndings from this exercise (column
21:562:48024:27:27:57:554:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:5) are very similar to those reported throughout the paper, providing assurance about the monotonicity
21:563:48126:27:27:57:554:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption. Alternatively, when we try a measure of judge stringency which varies by juvenile o¤ense
21:564:48226:27:0:57:554:77:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:type (violent crime, property crime or drug crime) we obtain estimates that are similar in magnitude to
22:565:48331:0:43:57:162:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:those reported earlier.
22:566:48354:43:34:57:311:680:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5.3  Extensions and Potential Mechanisms
22:567:48394:34:27:57:554:646:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We investigated whether the type of crime committed as a juvenile and having been incarcerated for
22:568:48492:27:28:57:554:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that crime as juvenile exert a di¤erential impact on adult recidivism in the same crime category. The
22:569:48593:28:27:57:554:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results from this exercise are displayed in Table 8. The instrumental variables estimate in column (1)
22:570:48695:27:27:57:554:564:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:show that, consistent with the results of Table 6, juvenile incarceration has a positive impact on adult
22:571:48799:27:27:57:554:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conviction of a drug o¤ense, but having been convicted of a drug charge as a juvenile has no impact on
22:572:48901:27:27:57:554:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the propensity of conviction of a drug crime in adulthood. Column (2) of Table 8 similarly shows that
22:573:49002:27:27:57:554:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile incarceration has no impact on adult recidivism in case of violent crimes, and that having been
22:574:49106:27:27:57:554:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:convicted of a violent crime as a juvenile has no impact either. Column (3) reveals the same picture with a
22:575:49213:27:27:57:554:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:slight twist: Consistent with the results in Table 6, we nd that juvenile incarceration experience reduces
22:576:49320:27:27:57:554:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the propensity to commit a property crime as an adult. However, we also nd that if the individual
22:577:49418:27:27:57:554:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:had a criminal experience as a juvenile for a property crime, the impact of incarceration is smaller (-
22:578:49521:27:28:57:554:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:0.467+0.138), although the net e¤ect of incarceration is negative and still statistically di¤erent from zero
22:579:49629:28:27:57:164:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with a p-value of 0.00.
22:580:49652:27:27:74:554:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also analyzed the extent to which incarceration as a juvenile has any di¤erential e¤ect on adult
22:581:49751:27:27:57:554:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recidivism by race and by age at youth conviction. We report the results in Appendix Table A3. Odd
22:582:49849:27:27:57:554:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:numbered columns in Appendix Table A3 present the results based on race, while even numbered columns
22:583:49949:27:27:57:554:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:report the results based on age. There is some weak evidence for di¤erential e¤ects by race for violent
22:584:50052:27:27:57:554:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime (Column 3) and by age at conviction for property crime (Column 6). However, the estimated e¤ects
22:585:50154:27:27:57:501:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of youth incarceration overall do not appear to reveal any signicant degree of heterogeneity.
22:586:50248:27:27:74:554:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It can be argued that the deterrence e¤ect reported for property crime (see Table 6) may be due to
22:587:50346:27:0:57:554:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incapacitation. Juveniles who spend time in a secure detention facility will have fewer opportunities to
23:588:50452:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recidivate after they are released if they have served time in detention beyond the age of 18.13There
23:589:50553:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are, however, only 62 individuals involved in adult property crime whose release date is set at age 19 or
23:590:50658:27:27:57:371:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:above. Dropping these observations had no impact on the results.
23:591:50722:27:27:74:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also estimated the models using the intensive margin of di¤erent crimes as outcomes. That is, we
23:592:50821:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dened the outcome as the number of crimes committed rather than whether or not the person is convicted
23:593:50924:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of a crime. The same picture has emerged. When the outcome is the number all crimes committed as an
23:594:51023:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adult, the impact of juvenile incarceration is not di¤erent from zero (-0.099, se=0.265). The same result
23:595:51128:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is obtained when the outcome is the number of violent crimes committed (-0.051. se=0.118). Consistent
23:596:51229:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with previous results obtained on the extensive margin, when the outcome is the number of property
23:597:51327:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crimes, the impact of juvenile incarceration is -0.504 (se=0.121), indicating that having been incarcerated
23:598:51434:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a juvenile (as opposed to having been found guilty, but not going to prison) reduces the intensity of
23:599:51538:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the property crime activity as an adult. Consistent with previous results, juvenile incarceration increases
23:600:51645:27:27:57:352:398:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:the number of drug o¤enses in adulthood (0.370, se=0.158).14
23:601:51705:27:27:74:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Recall the discussion in Section 4.3, where we have shown that time served in prison is not related to
23:602:51807:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:judge stringency in incarceration, holding constant incarceration. At the same time, there is variation in
23:603:51913:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time served among those who are incarcerated. To investigate whether the impact of juvenile incarceration
23:604:52018:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on recidivism is di¤erent between those who spent more vs. less time in detention, we re-estimated the
23:605:52120:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:models by creating a sample of juveniles by excluding those who have served longer than 209 days (which
23:606:52223:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is the median time served, conditional on incarceration), and another sample that excludes those who
23:607:52323:27:27:57:243:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stayed in prison shorter than 209 days.
23:608:52362:27:27:74:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Columns (1) and (2) in Panel (C) of Table 9 show that the impact of being incarcerated as a juvenile
23:609:52462:27:26:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reduces the propensity to recidivate for property crime as an adult, but that this deterrent e¤ect is not
23:610:52567:26:15:66:553:128:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:13Judges can set a maximum duration of disposition up to the youths 18th birthday. The maximum duration can extend
23:611:52682:15:11:57:554:113:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:up to 21st birthday if the juvenile o¤ense involves heinous crimes such as murder and rape (Louisiana Childrens Code CHC
23:612:52803:11:7:57:101:102:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:686-897.1).
23:613:52814:7:15:66:554:95:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:14The sample mean of the number of property crimes with which individuals are charged as an adult is 0.15 (min=0,
23:614:52927:15:11:57:92:80:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:max=6).
23:615:52934:11:0:66:553:69:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:The sample mean of the number of drug crimes with which individuals are charged as an adult is 0.19 (min=0, max=6).
24:616:53051:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:signicantly di¤erent between those who stayed in prison shorter or longer than the median time. In
24:617:53150:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other words, time spent in prison does not inuence the magnitude of the deterrent e¤ect of incarceration
24:618:53255:27:27:57:183:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in case of property crimes.
24:619:53282:27:27:74:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Panel B shows that, consistent with the previous results, adult violent crime is not impacted by
24:620:53378:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile incarceration, regardless of the duration of incarceration.  Panel A of Table 9 indicates that
24:621:53481:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juvenile incarceration has no statistically signicant impact on adult drug conviction if time spent in
24:622:53584:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration as a juvenile is shorter than the median (column 1). On the other hand, column (2) of
24:623:53683:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Panel A reveals that incarceration as a juvenile increases the propensity for conviction of a drug crime as
24:624:53790:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an adult if time spent in incarceration as a juvenile is longer than 209 days. Note also that the estimated
24:625:53897:27:27:57:352:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¤ect is considerably larger than that obtained in column (1).
24:626:53959:27:27:74:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This could be because of three possible reasons.  First, longer duration in incarceration increases
24:627:54058:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exposure to other convicted juveniles and this negative peer e¤ect might be the driver for adult drug
24:628:54159:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conviction. This explanation is unlikely because peer e¤ects explanation would be equally applicable in
24:629:54262:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:case of violent and property crimes, but we observe no di¤erential e¤ects of prison duration in case of
24:630:54365:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these adult crimes. Second, negative selection could be the reason: those who end up staying longer in
24:631:54467:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prison, conditional in incarceration, could be di¤erent from those who spend less time in prison. The
24:632:54568:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unobservable, likely pre-existing, attributes of these long-stayers might be responsible for their higher
24:633:54673:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recidivism rates. This explanation, while plausible, is also inconsistent with the other results reported in
24:634:54781:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 9, because under this scenario one would observe di¤erential recidivism rates between those who
24:635:54882:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spend less and more time in prison in other crime categories as well, but this is not the case. Relatedly,
24:636:54988:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:note also that all specications in Table 9 control for detailed juvenile o¤ense types (136 o¤ense xed
24:637:55091:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¤ects). A third explanation is that longer time spent in incarceration might induce additional stress on
24:638:55196:27:27:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juveniles and might impact their emotional well-being, making them more susceptible to drug use. As
24:639:55295:27:27:57:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mentioned earlier, 95 percent of all drug convictions receive either a suspended sentence or probation,
24:640:55398:27:0:57:554:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which indicates that the overwhelming majority of drug conviction are related to drug use, rather than
25:641:55502:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:drug selling. This suggests that longer jail time would make the juveniles more likely to use drugs upon
25:642:55606:27:43:57:126:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leaving prison.

25:644:55666:34:28:57:554:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The impact of imprisonment on human capital accumulation and future labor market outcomes is not
25:645:55762:28:27:57:554:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well-understood. For example, Landersø (2015) used register data from Denmark and found that longer
25:646:55861:27:27:57:554:564:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration spells generated lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, possibly due to rehabili-
25:647:55963:27:27:57:554:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tation. This nding is echoed by Bhuller et al (2016) using data from Norway. Similarly, Kling (2006)
25:648:56064:27:27:57:554:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reported a small positive impact of incarceration on employment in the U.S. Aizer and Doyle (2015), on
25:649:56166:27:27:57:554:483:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the other hand, reported that juvenile incarceration has a negative e¤ect on high school completion in
25:650:56268:27:27:57:166:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Chicago/Cook County.
25:651:56288:27:27:74:554:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because we can link the juvenile o¤enders with the public high school records in the state, we can
25:652:56386:27:27:57:554:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investigate the impact of incarceration as a juvenile on the probability of completing high school. That is,
25:653:56494:27:27:57:554:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we replace our outcome of interest in equation (1) with an indicator for high school graduation and re-run
25:654:56600:27:28:57:554:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:OLS and IV regressions. The results from this exercise are reported in Table 10. The OLS regressions
25:655:56700:28:27:57:554:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicate about a 5 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of high school graduation following juvenile
25:656:56807:27:27:57:554:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration (Panel A). However, when we estimate the same model with instrument variables as before,
25:657:56909:27:27:57:554:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we nd that juvenile incarceration has no impact on high school graduation (columns 1-2 of Panel B, Table
25:658:57014:27:27:57:554:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10). This result is di¤erent from Aizer and Doyle (2015). In an attempt to reconcile these conicting
25:659:57115:27:27:57:554:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results, we partition the data as birth cohorts from (i) 1979 to 1982, and (ii) 1983 to 1987. The former
25:660:57219:27:27:57:437:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group partially overlaps with the birth cohorts used by Aizer and Doyle (2015).
25:661:57298:27:27:74:554:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Column (3) of Table 10 presents the IV specication which allows the impact of juvenile incarceration
25:662:57399:27:27:57:554:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to di¤er between these two cohorts. The estimated e¤ect of juvenile incarceration for earlier birth cohorts
25:663:57506:27:27:57:554:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicates a statistically signicant 15 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of high school gradua-
25:664:57613:27:0:57:554:77:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion, while the point estimate for more recent cohorts is positive but insignicant. We also experiment
26:665:57718:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the same analysis by (i) dropping GED recipients from the e¤ective sample (around 20 percent of all
26:666:57817:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high school graduates) and (ii) redening early cohorts to include years from 1979 to 1983. Doing so
26:667:57917:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:does not alter the results. For example, the estimated e¤ect for earlier cohorts indicates a 12 percentage
26:668:58023:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point reduction in the likelihood of standard high school diploma when we exclude GED recipients. The
26:669:58124:27:28:57:397:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obvious question is: what could be the source of this di¤erential e¤ect?
26:670:58196:28:27:74:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The Louisiana School and District Accountability system was adopted by the states Board of Ele-
26:671:58292:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mentary and Secondary Education in June 1998. The state identied 10- and 20-year goals for all public
26:672:58394:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schools and required schools to demonstrate progress toward these goals, which included targets in test
26:673:58497:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scores, increases in attendance and reduction in the dropout rates. As part of the new accountability
26:674:58598:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system, rst-time tenth grade students were required to take graduation exit exams (GEE) in English,
26:675:58698:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:math, science and social studies to be eligible for a standard high school diploma.15This new test-based
26:676:58802:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:promotion policy became e¤ective in the 2000-2001 academic year. Students failing to achieve the mini-
26:677:58904:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mum requirements in all portions of the standardized tests even after multiple attempts were not able to
26:678:59008:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obtain a diploma. The high school experience of more recent cohorts of juveniles in Louisiana coincide
26:679:59110:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with this policy adoption, which suggests that the new accountability system may have led to di¤erential
26:680:59214:28:27:57:187:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¤ects across birth cohorts.
26:681:59242:27:27:74:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To further explore this hypothesis, we plot high school graduation trends over birth cohorts disaggre-
26:682:59344:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gated by juvenile incarceration status in Figure 2. The horizontal axis identies the birth cohort. High
26:683:59448:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school graduation rates of incarcerated juveniles, represented by the solid line, remained rather steady
26:684:59552:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across birth cohorts.  This may not be surprising because of a potential oor e¤ect, i.e., high school
26:685:59654:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graduation rates of incarcerated juveniles are consistently low (around 20 percent), and therefore they
26:686:59757:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are not responsive to variation in the policy environment. There is, however, a clear decreasing trend
26:687:59859:27:27:57:554:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:among non-incarcerated individuals after the cohort of 1982 in both Panels A and B. (the birth cohorts
26:688:59961:27:26:57:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of 1983 and 1984 are likely to be the rst cohorts that are impacted by the adoption of the test-based
26:689:60063:26:15:66:554:74:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:15More precisely, GEE English and math were administered in grade 10. Science and social studies were administered in
26:690:60180:15:0:57:407:59:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:grade 11 (GEE Interpretive Guide, Louisiana Department of Education-various years).
27:691:60265:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:promotion policy in high school). The introduction of GEE made it more di¢cult to obtain a high school
27:692:60367:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:degree, and as shown in Figure 2, this may have led to a decline in the high school graduation rates
27:693:60467:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of those juveniles who were delinquent, but who were not incarcerated. Put di¤erently, the exit exams
27:694:60568:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:introduced by the education reform may have induced some non-incarcerated juveniles to drop out of high
27:695:60671:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school, but it had no impact on already-low graduation rate of incarcerated juveniles. As a robustness
27:696:60773:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:check, we re-estimated the model in column (3) of Table 10 by re-dening Early Cohort. Specically,
27:697:60874:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when we dene the Early Cohort as those born in 1981 or earlier, or as those born in 1980 or earlier
27:698:60976:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the estimated coe¢cient of the interaction term is small, and not di¤erent from zero.16This nding is
27:699:61077:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consistent with the time-series behavior of the graduation rates presented in Figure 2, and it supports
27:700:61180:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the hypothesis that the education reform in Louisiana, that increased the high school graduation stan-
27:701:61282:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dards, eliminated the di¤erential graduation rates between incarcerated and non-incarcerated juveniles
27:702:61384:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by reducing the graduation rates of the non-incarcerated. Our proposed explanation is also consistent
27:703:61485:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with a number of existing studies that nd adverse e¤ects of high school exit exams on graduation rates,
27:704:61589:27:53:57:447:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in particular for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (Dee and Jacob 2007).
27:705:61668:53:38:57:269:318:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6  Conclusion and Discussion
27:706:61696:38:27:57:554:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper investigates the extent to which juvenile incarcerationexperience has an impact on adult
27:707:61795:27:27:57:554:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime and high school completion. While standard models of criminal activity predict that severity of
27:708:61896:27:27:57:554:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:punishment is a deterrent to crime (Becker 1968, Ehrlich 1973), it is also the case that incarceration
27:709:61998:27:27:57:554:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:experience can enhance criminal human capital, while depreciating legal human capital, and thus making
27:710:62100:27:27:57:554:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it more attractive to participate in crime in the future (Mocan et al. 2005). The issue is particularly
27:711:62203:27:27:57:521:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:important for juveniles who are in formative years of their human capitalboth legal and illegal.
27:712:62300:27:26:74:554:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Existing research, based on credible designs, have provided mixed evidence on the impact of juvenile
27:713:62400:26:15:66:553:92:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:16When we estimate the e¤ects of juvenile incarceration on adult recidivism by birth cohorts, the results are qualitatively
27:714:62523:15:0:57:209:77:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:similar to those presented in the text.
28:715:62564:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:punishment on criminal recidivism. Exploiting random assignment of cases to judges and using judge
28:716:62662:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stringency in punishment as an instrument, Bhuller et al. (2016) found that imprisonment discouraged
28:717:62762:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future criminal activity in Norway. They reported that this e¤ect was due to participation in programs
28:718:62864:27:27:57:554:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:aimed at improving employability. In other words, the e¤ect was reported to be driven by time spent
28:719:62963:27:28:57:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in prison with a focus on rehabilitation. The applicability of this nding in another setting, such as the
28:720:63069:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:U.S., where emphasis on rehabilitation is not as intensive as it is in Norway, is uncertain. In fact, Aizer
28:721:63176:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Doyle (2015) employ the same identication strategy and analyze data from Chicago/Cook County,
28:722:63274:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and report the opposite result that juvenile incarceration generates a drop in high school completion and
28:723:63379:27:27:57:554:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an increase in adult recidivism. The city of Chicago/Cook County, is of course radically di¤erent from
28:724:63481:27:27:57:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the average city in Norway, as well as from many other settings in the U.S. in a number of dimensions
28:725:63582:27:27:57:448:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ranging from the urbanization rate to the crime rate, to the conditions of prisons.
28:726:63665:27:27:74:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper we focus on a di¤erent setting: The American South. We use the universe of case les
28:727:63763:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of juveniles who were found guilty by juvenile courts between 1996 to 2012 in Louisiana. Each case le
28:728:63865:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contains information on the attributes of the juvenile o¤ender and the details of the case, including the
28:729:63970:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exact statute o¤ense committed, the date the juvenile was disposed before the judge and the court in
28:730:64070:28:27:57:554:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which the hearing was held. Importantly, the case les contain information not only on the disposition
28:731:64172:27:27:57:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:type of the juvenile (whether the juvenile was incarcerated, put on probation or placed in non-secure
28:732:64273:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:custody), but also the sentence length assigned by the judge, as well as the actual time served in prison.
28:733:64379:27:27:74:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We link these individuals to the records of adult crime data from the Louisiana Department of Public
28:734:64479:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Safety and Corrections that contain information on their adult convictions as well as the basic demo-
28:735:64580:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graphic information, the exact type of crime committed and sentence type (e.g., incarceration or pro-
28:736:64681:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bation).  We also link these records to the administrative records from the Louisiana Department of
28:737:64780:27:27:57:402:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Education to determine whether the juvenile has completed high school.
28:738:64850:27:27:74:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We exploit the institutional structure that randomly assigns juvenile case les to judges and we create
28:739:64953:27:0:57:554:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an instrument for having been sentenced to prison based on the idiosyncratic harshness of the judge
29:740:65054:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in his/her incarceration proclivity.  While OLS regressions demonstrate a positive impact of juvenile
29:741:65155:27:27:57:554:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration on future crime, instrumental variables regressions reveal a di¤erent picture. We nd that
29:742:65259:27:27:57:554:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on future violent crime, but that it lowers the propensity to
29:743:65362:27:27:57:243:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:commit a property crime in the future.
29:744:65400:27:28:74:554:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:On the other hand, incarceration as a juvenile increases the propensity of conviction for a drug o¤ense
29:745:65503:28:27:57:554:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in adulthood. This e¤ect appears to be mainly driven by time spent in prison as a juvenile. That is, we
29:746:65606:27:27:57:554:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fail to nd any statistically signicant impact of juvenile incarceration on adult drug o¤enses if time spent
29:747:65715:27:27:57:554:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in prison is less than the median time (209 days), but that longer incarceration signicantly increases the
29:748:65822:27:27:57:233:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:propensity for adult drug conviction.
29:749:65859:27:27:74:554:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We show that the overwhelming majority of adult drug convictions are arguably related to drug
29:750:65952:27:27:57:554:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:use rather than drug sales or tra¢cking because they receive probation, instead of prison time. Thus,
29:751:66053:27:27:57:554:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:although we have no direct evidence on drug use, this latter nding is consistent with the conjecture that
29:752:66159:27:27:57:554:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:longer time spent in prison as a juvenile may lead to adult drug use because of emotional stress endured
29:753:66263:27:27:57:554:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in long prison stays. We also show that these results are not due to incapacitation (inability to commit
29:754:66367:27:28:57:554:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:crime because of being in prison), nor is it plausible to attribute them to peer e¤ects in prison or to
29:755:66470:28:27:57:144:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative selection.
29:756:66489:27:27:74:554:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We nd that incarceration as a juvenile has no impact on high school completion propensity, except
29:757:66587:27:27:57:554:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the younger cohorts. This may be tied to an education reform, implemented in Louisiana in 1996,
29:758:66686:27:27:57:554:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which made it di¢cult to graduate from high school. As part of the new system, students have to pass
29:759:66786:27:27:57:554:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:competency exams in core subject to graduate from high school. We nd that for older cohorts, going
29:760:66885:27:27:57:554:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to prison as a juvenile reduced the probability of high school completion. On the other hand, among the
29:761:66988:27:27:57:554:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:younger cohorts, there is no e¤ect of juvenile incarceration on high school graduation. The reform may
29:762:67090:27:27:57:441:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have eliminated the advantage of not going to prison for the convicted juveniles.
29:763:67171:27:27:74:554:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In summary, our results obtained from a state in the American South fall in between those obtained
29:764:67269:27:0:57:554:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from a Scandinavian country (Norway) and a major metropolitan American city (Chicago/Cook County).
30:765:67369:0:27:57:554:723:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We nd that juvenile punishment is a double-edged sword: incarceration deters future property crime,
30:766:67469:27:0:57:527:696:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but it increases the propensity for adult drug conviction, if the actual time spent in prison is long.
