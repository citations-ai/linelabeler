5:108:3443:24:24:90:194:658:197:Times:197:Times:1.1  Introduction 
5:109:3461:24:24:126:130:634:197:Times:197:Times: 
5:110:3461:24:24:90:525:610:197:Times:197:Times:       The   financial   system   consists   of   specialized   and   non-specialized 
5:111:3547:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:financial  institutions,  of  organized  and  unorganized  financial  markets,  of  
5:112:3631:24:24:90:532:562:197:Times:197:Times:financial   instruments   and   services,   which   facilitate   transfer   of   funds.   
5:113:3721:24:24:90:536:538:197:Times:197:Times:Procedures    and    practices    adopted    in    the    markets,    and    financial    
5:114:3811:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:interrelationships  are  also  parts  of  this  system. In  product  or  other  service  
5:115:3900:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:markets,  purchasers  part  with  their  money  in  exchange  for  something  now.  
5:116:3984:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:In finance, money “now” is exchanged for a “promise to pay in the future”. 
5:117:4059:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:However, in  product or service markets, if the object sold – from a car to a 
5:118:4137:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:haircut – is defective, the buyers often find out relatively soon.1 On the other 
5:119:4218:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:hand, loan quality is not readily observable for quite some time and can be 
5:120:4294:24:24:90:530:369:197:Times:197:Times:hidden  for  extensive  periods.  Moreover,  banks  and  non-bank  financial  
5:121:4372:24:25:90:530:345:197:Times:197:Times:intermediaries  can  also  alter  the  risk  composition  of  their  assets  more  
5:122:4455:25:24:90:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:quickly  than  most  non-financial  industries,  and  banks  can  readily  hide  
5:123:4536:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:problems  by  extending  loans  to  clients  that  cannot  service  previous  debt  
5:124:4620:24:24:90:531:272:197:Times:197:Times:obligations.   Theoretically,   the   financial   market   facilitates   allocation   of   
5:125:4711:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:resources efficiently, which involves quick dissemination of information and 
5:126:4788:24:24:90:168:224:197:Times:197:Times:reaction to it. 
5:127:4804:24:24:126:531:200:197:Times:197:Times:   The   financial   markets   are   susceptible   to   manipulation   as   some   
5:128:4887:24:25:90:532:176:197:Times:197:Times:participants   have   information   that   others   do   not   that   is   information   
5:129:4976:25:24:90:528:151:197:Times:197:Times:asymmetry  is  ubiquitous  in  financial  markets.  To  overcome  this  problem

6:141:5610:24:24:90:505:538:197:Times:197:Times:a) To examine some of the major misdemeanors which perpetuated in the 
6:142:5680:24:25:90:340:514:197:Times:197:Times:financial system in 1991 and 2001 in India . 
6:143:5724:25:24:90:519:489:197:Times:197:Times:b) Understand  the financial  regulatory measures which have been adopted  
6:144:5799:24:24:90:514:465:197:Times:197:Times:after the 1991 share scam in India and why despite such measures adopted  
6:145:5873:24:24:90:295:441:197:Times:197:Times:security scam has recurred in  2001. 
6:146:5910:24:24:90:511:417:197:Times:197:Times:c) Examine the theoretical structure of corporate governance for analyzing 
6:147:5985:24:24:90:497:393:197:Times:197:Times:security scams that have occurred in the 1990s and the new millennium.

6:149:6130:24:25:90:521:345:197:Times:197:Times:to the share scams and financial frauds in India and abroad during the recent 
6:150:6208:25:24:90:484:320:197:Times:197:Times:decade that shook the financial markets. The third section surveys the 
6:151:6279:24:24:90:511:296:197:Times:197:Times:rationale for regulation of securities markets and the functional procedures 
6:152:6356:24:24:90:507:272:197:Times:197:Times:adopted in India in the aftermath of the scams. The fourth section looks at 
6:153:6432:24:24:90:521:248:197:Times:197:Times:the theoretical underpinnings of corporate governance which, is followed by 
6:154:6508:24:24:90:522:224:197:Times:197:Times:a discussion of the shortcomings of the regulatory set up in India which fails 
6:155:6587:24:24:90:392:200:197:Times:197:Times:to prevent the recurrence of financial misdemeanors.  
6:156:6641:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:Financial Liberalization is a phenomenon that is almost all pervasive in the 
6:157:6718:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:world  today.  While  liberalization  has  led  to  substantial  benefits  in  terms  of  
6:158:6808:24:30:90:533:127:197:Times:197:Times:increased   transparency,   it   has   ushered   in   opportunities   of   corporate

7:163:7108:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:ensure  that  suppliers  of  funds  receive  the  return  on  investment  is  not  
7:164:7191:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:sufficient  or  appropriate.  Recent  trends  through  the  1990s  in  India  and  
7:165:7274:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:abroad  reveal  how  corporate  governance  has  not  been  effective  permitting  
7:166:7357:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:unscrupulous and opportunistic individuals to manipulate the market in their 
7:167:7434:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:favor.    The  process  of  financial  market  regulation  ensures  that  important  
7:168:7519:24:24:90:531:562:197:Times:197:Times:guidelines   are   issued   regarding   how   primary   dealers   (brokers)   should   
7:169:7606:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:operate  with  regards  to  mode  of  operation,  conduct,  litigation,  amount  of

7:171:7757:25:24:126:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:These  security  scams  and  financial  scandals  discussed  here  involved  
7:172:7834:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:the manipulation of huge amounts of money. The perpetrators of these gross 
7:173:7909:24:24:90:530:441:197:Times:197:Times:transgression  had  such  a  comprehensive  knowledge  of  how  the  system  
7:174:7986:24:24:90:532:417:197:Times:197:Times:worked   that   they   manipulated   it   to   their   advantage   operating   in   an   
7:175:8075:24:24:90:525:393:197:Times:197:Times:opportunistic manner3. The essence of the argument in  is that the occurrence 
7:176:8153:24:24:90:529:369:197:Times:197:Times:and  reoccurrence  of  such  security  scams  and  financial  scandals  can  be  
7:177:8234:24:25:90:529:345:197:Times:197:Times:attributed  to  a  failure  of  corporate  governance  in  finance4  despite  the  
7:178:8317:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:existence  of  an  functioning  regulatory  authority  empowered  with  the  legal

8:191:8632:24:24:90:336:683:197:Times:197:Times:A security scam has the following features: 
8:192:8676:24:25:90:266:659:197:Times:197:Times:a)manipulation in share prices. 
8:193:8708:25:24:90:473:634:197:Times:197:Times:b)monopoly in dealing with a huge number of shares of a company. 
8:194:8773:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:c)money  laundering-borrowing  money  to  trade  in  securities  but  using  the  
8:195:8855:24:0:90:284:586:197:Times:197:Times:funds  for  unconnected  purposes.
8:196:8889:0:7:283:288:593:81:Times:81:Times:5
8:197:8890:7:24:288:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:  According  to  the  Securities  Exchange  
8:198:8934:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:Act(1934)SEA-"It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person  to  engage  in  any  act,  
8:199:9018:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:practice  or  course  of  action  which  operates  or  would  operate  as  a  fraud  or  
8:200:9107:24:25:90:530:514:197:Times:197:Times:deceit  upon  nay  person  in  connection  with  the  purchase  or  sale  of  a  
8:201:9188:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:security." While understanding the causes or possible mechanisms by which 
8:202:9262:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:a  security  scam  takes  places  we  can  on  a  parallel  plane  understand  the  
8:203:9346:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:motives  for  financial  market  regulation  otherwise  called  the  economics  of  
8:204:9430:24:24:90:529:417:197:Times:197:Times:financial  market  regulation.  There  is  a  certain  systemic  risk  involved  if  
8:205:9515:24:24:90:531:393:197:Times:197:Times:brokers   or   banks   get   into   settlement   problems   during   the   process   of   
8:206:9605:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:transacting  in  securities.  If  so,  it  results  in  a  domino  effect,  which  could  
8:207:9695:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:create  problems  for  other  banks  and  brokers  in  the  system.  A  systemic  risk  
8:208:9783:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:also can occur when there is not enough liquidity in the system due to very 
8:209:9859:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:few  brokers,  monopolizing  in  the  transaction  of  a  security.  Also  insider  
8:210:9943:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:trading is another problem when traders who are insiders to an organization 
8:211:10019:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:trade when they have superior knowledge which is considered unfair and an 
8:212:10093:24:24:90:530:224:197:Times:197:Times:extension  of  asymmetric  information.  Also  concentration  tendencies  of  
8:213:10171:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:traders towards dealing in one security only should be avoided. There is also 
8:214:10249:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:a consumer protection to ensure that the price formation process is efficient 
8:215:10327:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:as possible and also to ensure sufficient competition among traders, brokers 
8:216:10404:24:31:90:261:127:197:Times:197:Times:and other market participants.

10:301:11790:24:24:90:94:683:197:Times:197:Times: 
10:302:11790:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:In  April  1992,  press  reports  indicated  that  there  was  a  shortfall  in  the  
10:303:11876:25:24:90:530:634:197:Times:197:Times:Government  Securities  held  by  the  State  Bank  of  India.  Investigations  
10:304:11956:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:uncovered  the  tip  of  an  iceberg,  later  called  the  securities  scam,  involving  
10:305:12045:24:0:90:453:586:197:Times:197:Times:misappropriation  of  funds  to  the  tune  of  over  Rs.  3500  Crores

10:307:12117:7:24:457:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:.  The  scam  
10:308:12131:24:24:90:530:562:197:Times:197:Times:engulfed  top  executives  of  large  nationalized  banks,  foreign  banks  and  
10:309:12212:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:financial  institutions,  brokers,  bureaucrats  and  politicians:  The  functioning  
10:310:12298:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:of  the  money  market  and  the  stock  market  was  thrown  in  disarray.  The  
10:311:12380:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:tainted shares were worthless as they could not be sold. This created a panic 
10:312:12458:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:among  investors  and  brokers  and  led    to  a  prolonged  closure  of  the  stock  
10:313:12545:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:exchanges along with a precipitous drop in the price of shares. Soon after the 
10:314:12624:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:discovery  of  the  scam,  the  stock  prices  dropped  by  over  40%,  wiping  out  
10:315:12709:24:24:90:529:393:197:Times:197:Times:market  value  to  the  tune  of  Rs.  100,000  crores.  The  normal  settlement  
10:316:12791:24:24:90:530:369:197:Times:197:Times:process  in  government  securities  was  that  the  transacting  banks  made  
10:317:12870:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:payments  and  delivered  the  securities  directly  to  each  other.  The  broker's  
10:318:12956:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:only  function  was  to  bring  the  buyer  and  seller  together.  During  the  scam,  
10:319:13044:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:however, the banks or at least some banks adopted an alternative settlement 
10:320:13120:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:process similar to settlement of stock market transactions. The deliveries of 
10:321:13198:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:securities  and  payments  were  made  through  the  broker.  That  is,  the  seller  
10:322:13284:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:handed  over  the  securities  to  the  broker  who  passed  them  on  to  the  buyer,  
10:323:13372:24:24:90:525:200:197:Times:197:Times:while the buyer gave the cheque to the broker who then made the payment to 
10:324:13447:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:the  seller.  There  were  two  important  reasons  why  the  broker  intermediated  
10:325:13532:25:48:90:462:151:197:Times:197:Times:settlement began to be used in the government securities markets: 
10:326:13598:48:7:90:524:103:99:Times:99:Times:

10:328:13790:12:0:90:391:84:42:Times:99:Times:8 Stock market Scam in India of 1991:The Janakiraman Committee Report 
11:329:13860:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:• The brokers instead of merely bringing buyers and sellers together started 
11:330:13937:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:taking positions in the market. They in a sense imparted greater liquidity to 
11:331:14015:24:25:90:162:659:197:Times:197:Times:the markets. 
11:332:14028:25:0:90:481:634:197:Times:197:Times:•  When  a  bank  wanted  to  conceal  the  fact  that  it  was  doing  an  
11:333:14104:0:7:481:486:641:81:Times:81:Times:9
11:334:14105:7:24:486:525:634:197:Times:197:Times:Ready 
11:335:14111:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:Forward deal, the broker came in handy. The broker provided contract notes 
11:336:14186:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:for  this  purpose  with  fictitious  counterparties,  but  arranged  for  the  actual  
11:337:14274:24:24:90:529:562:197:Times:197:Times:settlement  to  take  place  with  the  correct  counterparty.  This  allowed  the  
11:338:14358:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:broker  to  lay  his  hands  on  the  cheque  as  it  went  from  one  bank  to  another  
11:339:14448:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:through  him.  The  hurdle  now  was  to  find  a  way  of  crediting  the  cheque  to  
11:340:14536:25:24:90:529:489:197:Times:197:Times:his  account  though  it  was  drawn  in  favour  of  a  bank  and  was  crossed  
11:341:14618:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:account payee. It is purely a matter of banking custom that an account payee 
11:342:14695:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:cheque is paid only to the payee mentioned on the cheque. In fact, privileged 
11:343:14773:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:(corporate)   customers   were   routinely   allowed   to   credit   account   payee   
11:344:14860:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:cheques in favour of a bank into their own accounts to avoid clearing delays, 
11:345:14938:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:thereby  reducing  the  interest  lost  on  the  amount.  The  brokers  thus  found  a  
11:346:15026:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:way  of  getting  hold  of  the  cheques  as  they  went  from  one  bank  to  another  
11:347:15114:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:and crediting the amounts to their accounts. This effectively transformed an 
11:348:15191:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:RF into a loan to a broker rather than to a bank. But this, by itself, would not 
11:349:15272:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:have led to the scam because the RF after all is a secured loan, and a secured 
11:350:15351:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:loan to a broker is still secured. What was necessary now was to find a way 
11:351:15427:24:24:90:276:224:197:Times:197:Times:of eliminating the security itself. 
11:352:15463:24:24:90:338:200:197:Times:197:Times:Three routes adopted for this purpose were: 
11:353:15507:24:25:90:525:176:197:Times:197:Times:• Some banks (or rather their officials) were persuaded to part with cheques 
11:354:15584:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:without  actually  receiving  securities  in  return.  A  simple  explanation  of  this  
11:355:15673:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:is that the officials concerned were bribed and/or negligent. Alternatively, as 
11:356:15753:24:0:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:long as the scam lasted, the banks benefited from such an arrangement. The 
12:357:15828:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:management of banks might have been sorely tempted to adopt this route to 
12:358:15902:24:24:90:203:683:197:Times:197:Times:higher profitability. 
12:359:15924:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:• The second route was to replace the actual securities by a worthless piece 
12:360:16001:25:0:90:199:634:197:Times:197:Times:of  paper  –  a  fake  
12:361:16024:0:7:200:209:641:81:Times:81:Times:10
12:362:16026:7:24:209:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:Bank  Receipt  (BR).  A  BR  like  an  IOU  has  only  the  
12:363:16086:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:borrower's  assurance  that  the  borrower  has  the  securities  which  can/will  be  
12:364:16173:24:24:90:281:586:197:Times:197:Times:delivered if/when the need arises. 
12:365:16208:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:•  The  third  method  was  simply  to  forge  the  securities  themselves.  In  many  
12:366:16295:24:24:90:529:538:197:Times:197:Times:cases,  PSU  bonds  were  represented  only  by  allotment  letters  rather  than  
12:367:16378:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:certificates  on  security  paper.  However,  it  accounted  for  only  a  very  small  
12:368:16466:25:24:90:530:489:197:Times:197:Times:part  of  the  total  funds  misappropriated.  During  the  scam,  the  brokers  
12:369:16547:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:perfected  the  art  of  using  fake  BRs  to  obtain  unsecured  loans  from  the  
12:370:16631:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:banking  system.  They  persuaded  some  small  and  little  known  banks  –  the  
12:371:16714:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:Bank  of  Karad  (BOK)  and  the  Metropolitan  Cooperative  Bank  (MCB)  -  to  
12:372:16795:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:issue  BRs  as  and  when  required.  These  BRs  could  then  be  used  to  do  RF  
12:373:16880:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:deals  with  other  banks.  The  cheques  in  favour  of  BOK  were,  of  course,  
12:374:16963:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:credited into the brokers' accounts. In effect, several large banks made huge 
12:375:17041:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:unsecured loans to the BOK/MCB which in turn made the money available 
12:376:17111:24:24:90:174:296:197:Times:197:Times:to the brokers.

13:400:18497:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:Of  all  the  recent  encounters  of  the  Indian  public  with  the  much-celebrated  
13:401:18584:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:forces  of  the  market,  the  Unit  Trust’s  US-64  debacle  is  the  worst12.  Its  
13:402:18670:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:gravity  far  exceeds  the  stock  market  downswing  of  the  mid-1990s,  which  
13:403:18752:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:wiped  out  Rs.  20,000  crores  in  savings.  13The  debacle  is  part  of  the  recent  
13:404:18842:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:economic  slowdown  which  has  eliminated  one  million  jobs  and  also  burst  
13:405:18924:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:the information technology (IT) bubble. This has tragically led to suicides by 
13:406:19003:24:24:90:530:296:197:Times:197:Times:investors.  And    then  suspension  of  trading  in  US-64made  the  hapless  
13:407:19082:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:investors  more  dejected  at  the  sinking  of  this  "super-safe"  public  sector  
13:408:19167:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:instrument  that  had  delivered  a  regular  return  since  1964.  There  is  a  larger  
13:409:19257:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:lesson  in  the  US-64  debacle  for  policies  towards  public  savings  and  public  
13:410:19344:24:24:90:534:200:197:Times:197:Times:sector   undertakings   (PSUs).   The   US-64   crisis   is   rooted   in   plain   
13:411:19428:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:mismanagement. US-64 was launched as a steady income fund. Logically, it 
13:412:19501:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:should  have  invested  in  debt,  especially  low-risk  fixed-income  government  
13:413:19584:24:20:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:bonds. Instead, its managers increasingly invested in equities, with high-risk 
13:414:19663:20:7:90:236:107:99:Times:99:Times:

14:417:19831:0:24:90:530:707:197:Times:197:Times:speculative  returns.In  the  late  1980s  UTI  was  "politicised"  with  other  
14:418:19912:24:24:90:529:683:197:Times:197:Times:financial  institutions  (FIs)  such  as  LIC  and  GIC,  and  made  to  invest  in  
14:419:19997:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:certain  favoured  scrips.  By  the  mid-1990s,  equities  exceeded  debt  in  its  
14:420:20081:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:portfolio.  The  FIs  were  also  used  to "boost  the  market"  artificially  as  an  
14:421:20167:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:"endorsement"  of  controversial  economic  policies.  In  the  past  couple  of  
14:422:20249:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:years, UTI made downright imprudent but heavy investments in stocks from 
14:423:20322:24:24:90:530:562:197:Times:197:Times:Ketan  Parekh’s  favourite  K-10  portfolio,  such  as  Himachal  Futuristic,  
14:424:20401:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:Global  Tele  and  DSQ.  These  "technology"  investments  took  place  despite  
14:425:20482:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:indications  that  the  "technology  boom"  had  ended.  US-64  lost  half  its  Rs.  
14:426:20568:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:30,000 crore portfolio value within a year. UTI sank Rs. 3,400 crores in just 
14:427:20646:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:six out of a portfolio of 44 scrips. This eroded by 60 percent. Early this year, 
14:428:20727:24:24:90:525:441:197:Times:197:Times:US-64’s net asset value plunged below par (Rs.10). But it was re-purchasing 
14:429:20803:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:US-64 above Rs. 14! Today, its NAV stands at Rs. 8.30 - a massive loss for 
14:430:20878:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:13  million  unit-holders.It  is  inconceivable  that  UTI  made  these  fateful  
14:431:20960:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:investment decisions on its own. According to insiders, the Finance Ministry 
14:432:21037:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:substantially  influenced  them:  all  major  decisions  need  high-level  political  
14:433:21123:25:24:90:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:approval.  Indeed,  collusion  between  the  FIs,  and  shady  operators  like  
14:434:21203:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:Harshad  Mehta,  was  central  to  the  Securities  Scam  of  1992.  The  Joint  
14:435:21284:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:Parliamentary  Committee’s  report  documents  this.  In  recent  months,  the  
14:436:21364:24:24:90:531:248:197:Times:197:Times:Finance  Ministry  became  desperate  to  reverse  the  post-Budget  market  
14:437:21441:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:downturn.  UTI’s  misinvestment  now  coincided  with  the  global  technology  
14:438:21521:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:"meltdown." US-64 crashed. UTI chairman resigned. Although culpable, he 
14:439:21593:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:was probably a scapegoat too. The Ministry has kept a close watch on UTI, 
14:440:21667:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:especially since 1999.The US-64 debacle, then, is not just a UTI scam. It is a 
14:441:21746:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:governance  scam  involving  mismanagement  by  a  government  frustrated  at  
14:442:21825:24:20:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:the failure of its macroeconomic calculations. This should have ensured the

15:445:22095:0:24:90:529:707:197:Times:197:Times:Finance  Minister’s  exit  in  any  democracy  which  respects  parliamentary  
15:446:22174:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:norms. There are larger lessons in the UTI debacle. If a well-established, and 
15:447:22253:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:until  recently  well-managed,  institution  like  UTI  cannot  safeguard  public  
15:448:22336:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:savings,  then  we  should  not  allow  the  most  precious  of  such  savings  -  
15:449:22419:24:24:90:522:610:197:Times:197:Times:pensions  -  to  be  put  at  risk.  Such  risky  investment  is  banned  in  many  self-
15:450:22508:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:avowedly  capitalist  European  economies.  In  India,  the  argument  acquires  
15:451:22589:24:24:90:522:562:197:Times:197:Times:greater force given the poorly regulated, extremely volatile, stock market—
15:452:22664:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:where  a  dozen  brokers  control  90  percent  of  trade.  Yet,  there  is  a  proposal  
15:453:22754:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:by the Finance Ministry to privatize pensions and provident funds. Basically, 
15:454:22832:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:the government, deplorably, wants to get rid of its annual pension obligation 
15:455:22910:24:24:90:214:465:197:Times:197:Times:of Rs. 22,000 crores.

17:545:24961:25:24:90:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:Nikkei  average."  A  closer  look  at  the  reaction  of  market  participants  and  
17:546:25047:24:24:90:530:610:197:Times:197:Times:volatility  after  the  fall  may  provide  insight  into  the  magnitude  of  the  
17:547:25131:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:contagion effect. Barings' young trader Nicholas Leeson was supposed to be 
17:548:25206:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:"arbitraging", seeking to profit from differences in the prices of Nikkei-225 
17:549:25284:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:futures  contracts  listed  on  the  Osaka  Securities  Exchange  (OSE)  in  Japan  
17:550:25368:24:25:90:531:514:197:Times:197:Times:and   Singapore   Monetary   Exchange   (SIMEX).   Such   arbitrage   involves   
17:551:25449:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:buying  futures  contracts  on  one  market  and  selling  them  on  another.  Since  
17:552:25535:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:the margins on this are small, the volumes traded by arbitrageurs tend to be 
17:553:25612:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:large. However, this strategy is not very risky: a long position in one market 
17:554:25691:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:(betting on a rise) is offset by a short position (betting on a fall) in the other). 
17:555:25776:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:However, in addition to arbitraging the Osaka Exchange and the SIMEX, as 
17:556:25849:24:24:90:525:369:197:Times:197:Times:far back as September 1994, Leeson began to simultaneously sell put options 
17:557:25925:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:and  call  options  on  Nikkei-225  futures.  This  type  of  deal  is  known  as  a  
17:558:26011:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:"straddle."  If  the  market  is  less  volatile  than  the  options  prices  predict,  the  
17:559:26104:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:seller  makes  a  profit.  However,  as  a  result  of  the  Kobe  earthquake,  the  
17:560:26189:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:Nikkei-225  fluctuated  and  Leeson  began  to  exponentially  increase  the  size  
17:561:26273:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:of his open positions. By trading on a fraudulent account, numbered 88888, 
17:562:26348:24:24:90:522:224:197:Times:197:Times:Leeson began to buy futures on a large scale in an attempt to almost single-
17:563:26424:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:handedly push up the Nikkei 225. This proved unsuccessful and eventually 
17:564:26497:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:Leeson's  losses  were  so  large  the  bank  eventually  collapsed.  A  lifeboat  by  
17:565:26584:25:24:90:529:151:197:Times:197:Times:the  Bank  of  England  was  not  feasible  due  to  the  fact  that  many  of  the  
17:566:26669:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:derivatives  were  impossible  to  wind  down  immediately,  as  the  options  did  
17:567:26753:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:not  expire  for  months.  While  this  case  has  been  widely  cited  as  providing  
17:568:26840:24:0:90:525:79:197:Times:197:Times:evidence of a market failure, others argue that the systemic risk from the loss 
18:569:26920:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:was  minimal.  Others  argue  that  in  the  event  of  a  viable  threat  of  systemic  
18:570:27009:24:24:90:529:683:197:Times:197:Times:risk,  the  Bank  of  England  would  have  bailed  out  Barings  Bank,  but  the  
18:571:27092:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:precise  magnitude  of  the  systemic  risk  is  not  known.  Reports  in  the  Wall  
18:572:27178:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:Street Journal immediately following the collapse of Barings express that the 
18:573:27256:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:markets were "shaken" but provide no quantifiable estimate of the effect of 
18:574:27332:24:24:90:163:586:197:Times:197:Times:the collapse.

18:579:27415:16:25:90:526:498:197:Times:197:Times:The perpetrators in this case were two brothers,the Gokal brothers, who were 
18:580:27492:25:24:90:526:473:197:Times:197:Times:shipping magnates. The fraudulent brothers and BCCI's founder Agha Hasan 
18:581:27565:24:24:90:526:449:197:Times:197:Times:Abedi, shared the confidence of a new world balance of power centered on 
18:582:27638:24:24:90:527:425:197:Times:197:Times:the  massive  Middle  East  oil  deposits.  Agha  Hasan  Abedi  went  as  far  as  to  
18:583:27725:24:24:90:531:401:197:Times:197:Times:fund  a  very  readable  business  magazine  called  SOUTH  which  was  a

18:585:27875:24:25:90:528:353:197:Times:197:Times:NEWSWEEK.  BCCI's  loans    through  Agha  Hasan  Abedi  to  the  brothers  
18:586:27951:25:24:90:527:328:197:Times:197:Times:shipping business were inflated, and their quality was upgraded by forgery. 
18:587:28027:24:24:90:528:304:197:Times:197:Times:The  fraud  went  on  for  over  a  decade..  The  BCCI-Gulf  Transport  Group  
18:588:28107:24:24:90:527:280:197:Times:197:Times:consortium  wanted  to  dip  their  fingers  into  the  coffers  of  one  of  their  best  
18:589:28198:24:24:90:526:256:197:Times:197:Times:sponsors, Sheikh Zayid of Abu Dhabi. The reason for this was the financial 
18:590:28273:24:24:90:527:232:197:Times:197:Times:hole  left  by  huge  losses  suffered  by  Gulf  on  the  derivatives  market.    It  is  
18:591:28364:24:24:90:527:208:197:Times:197:Times:certainly  true  that  Sheikh  Zayid  started  to  pick  up  the  losses  in  1990.  This  
18:592:28455:24:25:90:526:184:197:Times:197:Times:leaves open the argument of many muslims that the bank did not have to fail. 
18:593:28532:25:24:90:526:159:197:Times:197:Times:There is also deception in the way that  one of the perpetrators was brought 
18:594:28609:24:24:90:526:135:197:Times:197:Times:to justice. He was flying to the USA in order to clear himself of liability for 
18:595:28689:24:24:90:522:111:197:Times:197:Times:abbetting  in  the  production  of  a  Pakistani  nuclear  bomb.  Almost  any  high-
18:596:28773:24:0:90:527:87:197:Times:197:Times:tech  metallurgy  going  to  a  third  world  country  is  suspect.  In  the  same  way

19:599:29017:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:illicit drug refining ventures. The perpetrator took the plane from Karachi to 
19:600:29096:25:24:90:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:New  York  in  l994.  British  police  arrested  him  during  a  refuelling  stop  at

19:604:29214:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:At  the  heart  of  Enron's  demise  was  the  creation  of  partnerships  with  shell  
19:605:29302:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:companies,  these  shell  companies,  run  by  Enron  executives  who  profited  
19:606:29383:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:richly from them, allowed Enron to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in 
19:607:29458:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:debt  off  its  books.  But  once  stock  analysts  and  financial  journalists  heard  
19:608:29546:24:24:90:532:441:197:Times:197:Times:about   these   arrangements,   investors   began   to   lose   confidence   in   the   
19:609:29634:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:company's  finances.  The  results:  a  run  on  the  stock,  lowered  credit  ratings  
19:610:29722:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:and  insolvency.  According  to  claims  and  counter-claims  filed  in  Delaware  
19:611:29805:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:court  hearings(of  the  Enron  Case);  many  of  the  most  prominent  names  in

19:613:29967:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:Bank and Dresdner Bank - were still involved in the partnership, directly or 
19:614:30044:24:24:90:530:296:197:Times:197:Times:indirectly,  when  Enron  filed  for  bankruptcy.  Originally,  it  appears  that  
19:615:30127:24:0:90:237:272:197:Times:197:Times:initially Enron was using

19:619:30290:24:24:90:530:224:197:Times:197:Times:did  wrong  was  that  they  apparently  tried  to  manufacture  earnings  by

20:633:31257:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:were  controlled  by  Enron  management.  The  scope  and  importance  of  the  
20:634:31337:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:off-balance sheet vehicles were not widely known among investors in Enron

20:636:31498:25:24:90:529:489:197:Times:197:Times:1999,  according  to  company  estimates,  it  had  moved  $27bn  of  its  total

21:658:32578:0:24:90:348:707:197:Times:197:Times:3 Financial Market Regulation (Rationale) 
21:659:32620:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:The nature of securities markets is such that they are inherently susceptible 
21:660:32698:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:to failures due to the existence of information asymmetries and existence of 
21:661:32775:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:high  transaction  costs  Sanyal  (1997).  It  needs  to  be  emphasized  that  when  
21:662:32861:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:securities  markets  come  into  existence,  the  interest  of  the  member  brokers  
21:663:32947:24:24:90:531:586:197:Times:197:Times:are   taken   care   of   through   margin   requirements,   barriers   to   entry   of   
21:664:33037:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:membership, listing agreements. However the investors/clients who buy and 
21:665:33111:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:sell via their brokers are not able to form an organization to safeguard their 
21:666:33190:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:interests  due  to  the  cost  of  creation  of  such  organizations  and  free  rider  
21:667:33278:25:24:90:531:489:197:Times:197:Times:problems.  The  distinctive  nature  of  the  market  can  be  observed  with  
21:668:33357:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:reference  to  the  commodity,  its  quality,  the  system  of  transactions  and  the  
21:669:33445:24:24:90:305:441:197:Times:197:Times:participants in the market, as follows: 
21:670:33485:24:24:90:400:417:197:Times:197:Times:(a) the commodity(the security)has a life to perpetuity. 
21:671:33542:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:(b) while the outcome of the contract say the redemption of debt is certain, 
21:672:33619:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:in the case of the government, it is not always so in the case of a private debt 
21:673:33700:24:25:90:362:345:197:Times:197:Times:instrument, hence uncertainty comes into focus. 
21:674:33748:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:(c) the quality of private debt instrument is unobservable and hence, it is the 
21:675:33828:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:trust  reposed  on  the  trader  or  the  issuer  that  is  the  decisive  factor,  here  the  
21:676:33923:24:24:90:327:272:197:Times:197:Times:problem of information comes into focus. 
21:677:33964:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:(d) in any securities market in any transaction or deal there are at least four 
21:678:34044:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:participants,  two  clients  and  two  brokers.  The  brokers  negotiate  deals  with  
21:679:34131:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:each other on behalf of their clients and thus the problem of transaction cost 
21:680:34210:24:25:90:520:176:197:Times:197:Times:comes into focus. When there is so much scope for failure and opportunism, 
21:681:34285:25:24:90:529:151:197:Times:197:Times:there  appears  to  be  substantial  ground  for  prescribing  an  institution  that  
21:682:34371:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:oversees the market at different stages to ensure its reliability, efficiency and  
21:683:34454:24:24:90:197:103:197:Times:197:Times:it's very existence.

22:686:34475:25:23:90:368:682:197:Times:197:Times:3.1 Objective of Financial Market Regulation  
22:687:34521:23:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:The  objective  of  regulation  and  supervision  is  to  facilitate  the  efficient  and  
22:688:34612:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:fair  performance  of  economic  functions,  but  a  practical  regulatory  structure  
22:689:34699:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:must  deal  with  (and  will  influence)  the  products  and  institutions  through  
22:690:34784:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:which those functions are performed. This creates considerable complexities 
22:691:34860:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:because  there  is  no  unique  relationship  between  functions,  products,  and  
22:692:34943:24:24:90:531:538:197:Times:197:Times:institutions.   Several   products   might   perform   the   same   function,   some   
22:693:35030:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:functions might involve several products, institutions can provide a range of 
22:694:35108:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:products,  and  these  relationships  can  be  changing  over  time,  in  response  to  
22:695:35196:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:technological  change  and  in  ways  influenced  by  the  existing  regulatory  
22:696:35277:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:structure.  One  focus  of  financial  regulation  is  upon  the  characteristics  of  
22:697:35364:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:financial  products,  which  are  explicit  or  implicit  contracts  between  parties,  
22:698:35452:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:entered  into  with  certain  expectations  on  the  basis  of  information  held  by  
22:699:35539:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:those  parties.  Financial  regulation  stems  in  large  part  from  the  undesirable  
22:700:35627:24:25:90:536:345:197:Times:197:Times:consequences    of    participants    entering    contracts    with    inappropriate    
22:701:35715:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:expectations based on imperfect information. Participants may be unable to 
22:702:35790:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:obtain information to appropriately evaluate the ability of a counter-party to 
22:703:35869:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:meet  a  contractual  obligation  (such  as  payment  of  an  insurance  benefit),  or  
22:704:35957:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:may be given incorrect information which leads them to form inappropriate 
22:705:36031:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:expectations  of  performance  (such  as  of  a  managed  fund).  Ultimately,  the  
22:706:36115:24:24:90:492:200:197:Times:197:Times:focus of a regulatory structure must be on the welfare of the end users.  
22:707:36189:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:Financial  products  are  contracts  between  two  parties,  issued  under  specific  
22:708:36275:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:legal arrangements. While there may be an argument that individuals have a 
22:709:36350:24:24:90:528:127:197:Times:197:Times:"natural"  right  to  enter  into  such  contracts  as  deposit  takers,  there  is  no  
22:710:36439:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:"natural" right possessed by institutions, which allows them to do so. That is 
22:711:36518:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:recognized  internationally  by  financial  legislation  of  most  nations,  which  
23:712:36602:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:impose  certain  socially  determined  criteria  upon  institutions  (institutional  
23:713:36687:24:24:90:532:683:197:Times:197:Times:form,   identity   of   owners,   competence   of   managers,   compliance   with   
23:714:36771:24:25:90:530:659:197:Times:197:Times:prudential  standards  etc.)  if  they  are  to  be  allowed  to  undertake  such  
23:715:36854:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:activities.  Also  they  should  be  a  good  incentive  structure  for  providing  
23:716:36938:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:information  in  financial  markets  as  information  is  very  important  to  the  
23:717:37022:24:24:90:530:586:197:Times:197:Times:investor.  Often  investors  find  it  difficult  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  
23:718:37109:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:security  or  service  offered  which  calls  for  an  intermediary  to  disseminate  
23:719:37195:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:information and services that have to be regulated. Regulations also prevent 
23:720:37272:24:25:90:532:514:197:Times:197:Times:monopoly   of   capital   markets   which   otherwise   jeopardize   the   market

30:904:48460:23:25:90:526:499:197:Times:197:Times: This section includes the motives behind financial market regulation. There 
30:905:48537:25:24:90:527:474:197:Times:197:Times:are several factors which motivate financial market regulation. One if them 
30:906:48613:24:24:90:530:450:197:Times:197:Times:is  the  systemic  risk  .Individual  agents  take  into  consideration  only  the  
30:907:48697:24:24:90:527:426:197:Times:197:Times:private cost and often forget the social cost involved in their transactions.If 
30:908:48777:24:24:90:532:402:197:Times:197:Times:one   trader   finds   difficulty   in   delivering   the   proposed   security   under   
30:909:48867:24:24:90:528:378:197:Times:197:Times:consideration  it  could  set  a  chain  or  reactions  which  could  affect  several  
30:910:48954:24:24:90:527:354:197:Times:197:Times:other  traders  in  the  system.So  will  be  the  case  if  banks  get  into  settlement  
30:911:49045:24:25:90:528:330:197:Times:197:Times:problems  or  failures.It  could  affect  several  other  banks  and  traders  in  the  
30:912:49133:25:24:90:526:305:197:Times:197:Times:system.Also it should be ensured that there is enough liquidity in the system. 
30:913:49212:24:24:90:528:281:197:Times:197:Times:This  can  be  allowed  by  making  sure  that  there  is  perfect  competition  and  
30:914:49298:24:24:90:528:257:197:Times:197:Times:removing  barriers  to  entry-the  more  traders  in  the  system,  more  liquidity.  
30:915:49384:24:24:90:529:233:197:Times:197:Times:Also  insider  trading  should  be  prohibited-i.e  when  some  traders  possess  
30:916:49466:24:24:90:529:209:197:Times:197:Times:superior  information  than  other  which  cause  the  latter  to  get  suboptimal  
30:917:49550:24:24:90:530:185:197:Times:197:Times:returns  in  transactions.  This  can  be  corrected  by  having  an  investment  
30:918:49632:24:25:90:529:161:197:Times:197:Times:banker  to  mediate  between  traders  and  ensuring  an  adequate  supply  of  
30:919:49712:25:24:90:528:136:197:Times:197:Times:information.  Insider  trading  allows  people  to  manipulate  with  prices  and  
30:920:49795:24:24:90:527:112:197:Times:197:Times:cause  monopolised  holding  of  shares.  As  more  and  more  traders  access  the  
30:921:49880:24:0:90:531:88:197:Times:197:Times:system  it  leads  to  benefits(positive  externalities)  to  all  as  opposed  to  
31:922:49964:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:monopoly.  Such  a  monopoly  condition  is  more  a  characteristic  of  security  
31:923:50048:24:24:90:532:683:197:Times:197:Times:markets   because   of   the   associated   low   transaction   costs   and   greater   
31:924:50136:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:regulation which raise the barriers to entry. Also these is need for consumer 
31:925:50214:25:24:90:530:634:197:Times:197:Times:protection  to  ensure  that  the  price  formation  process  is  as  efficient  as  
31:926:50299:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:possible.  Consumers  are  better  off  in  a  more  efficient  market  than  a  less  
31:927:50386:24:24:90:532:586:197:Times:197:Times:efficient   one.   A   more   efficient   market   can   be   ensured   by   reducing   
31:928:50474:24:24:90:532:562:197:Times:197:Times:asymmetric   information.   Principal   agent   relationships   are   common   in   
31:929:50558:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:securities  markets.  Retail  investors  typically  invest  in  different  funds  and  
31:930:50645:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:other  financial  services  firms.  Here  the  former  are  principals  and  the  latter  
31:931:50735:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:agents.  It  is  essentially  than  in  all  transactions  agents  do  not  deviate  from  
31:932:50826:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:what they are bound to so as mentioned in the contract. Also money which is 
31:933:50902:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:used  for  the  transaction  of  securities  should  not  be  used  for  any  king  of  
31:934:50990:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:personal benefit of traders nor should drug traders or criminals be allowed to 
31:935:51069:24:25:90:525:393:197:Times:197:Times:trade in securities thereby allowing themselves to perpetuate their evil deeds.

31:937:51149:24:24:90:282:344:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 a)The Systemic Risk Motive 
31:938:51180:24:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:The prime objective of most existing financial regulation and supervision is 
31:939:51257:24:0:90:501:296:197:Times:197:Times:to  ensure  that  no  systemic  risks  will  threaten  the  financial  system.  
31:940:51337:0:7:501:510:303:81:Times:81:Times:20
31:941:51339:7:24:510:525:296:197:Times:197:Times:In 
31:942:51342:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:principle, there are two assumptions underlying the concept of systemic risk. 
31:943:51420:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:The first assumption is the existence of a market failure, often in terms of an 
31:944:51500:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:externality.  The  individual  agents  only  take  the  private  costs  into  account  
31:945:51587:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:and any “potential social cost [or benefit] is not incorporated in the decision 
31:946:51667:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:making”  of  the  agents.  For  instance,  if  one  trader  encounters  problems  in  
31:947:51753:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:delivering  the  securities  after  a  trade,  problems  may  easily  spread  to  other  
31:948:51842:24:30:90:529:127:197:Times:197:Times:agents  through  the  settlement  system.  The  existence  of  an  externality  is  
31:949:51926:30:7:90:236:97:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
31:950:51984:7:16:90:522:90:42:Times:99:Times:20 Niemeyer,Jonas, “Where to Go after the Lamfalussy Report?An Economic Analysis of Securities Market 
31:951:52086:16:0:90:234:74:99:Times:99:Times:Regulation and Supervision”(2001) 
32:952:52120:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:however not enough to create a systemic risk. The scope of the effect is also 
32:953:52198:24:24:90:528:683:197:Times:197:Times:at  hand.  The  second  assumption  is  based  on  the  notion  that  if  problems  
32:954:52282:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:occur,  they  “would  damage  the  financial  system  to  such  an  extent  that  
32:955:52364:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:economic  activity  in  the  wider  economy  would  suffer.”  The  traditional  
32:956:52444:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:example of systemic risks is when financial problems in one bank lead to a 
32:957:52519:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:bank  run  which  in  turn  undermines  the  confidence  in  the  whole  banking  
32:958:52601:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:system, makes the payment system collapse, the money supply contract and 
32:959:52674:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:potentially results in a recession or even depression. In this case, the effects 
32:960:52755:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:on  other  banks  and  economic  agents,  let  alone  the  social  costs  of  a  general  
32:961:52845:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:depression, are not taken into account in the risk analysis of the bank or the 
32:962:52924:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:agent. In this paper, the focus is not on banking issues but on the problems 
32:963:53001:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:related  to  the  securities  markets.  In  terms  of  systemic  risks  resulting  from  
32:964:53090:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:activities   in   financial   markets,   there   are   two   main   concerns   ,   a)   the   
32:965:53184:24:24:90:525:393:197:Times:197:Times:settlement systems and b) the liquidity of the markets. Even though the focus 
32:966:53262:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:of  the  paper  is  not  on  banking  issues,  in  practice  the  banks  play  such  an  
32:967:53351:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:important  role  in  the  payment  and  therefore  in  the  settlement  of  financial  
32:968:53438:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:securities that banks and other financial intermediaries cannot be completely 
32:969:53516:24:24:90:358:296:197:Times:197:Times:ignored in a discussion of securities regulation. 
32:970:53566:24:24:90:97:272:197:Times:197:Times:  
32:971:53568:24:24:90:272:248:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 b)Clearing and Settlement 
32:972:53597:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:The  clearing  and  settlement  of  financial  securities  entails  several  problems.  
32:973:53685:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:First,  if  a  seller  of  a  financial  security  is  not  able  to  deliver,  it  may  cause  
32:974:53781:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:delivery  problems  in  other  transactions,  i.e.  have  domino  effects  on  many  
32:975:53866:25:24:90:530:151:197:Times:197:Times:other  traders.  If  one  trader  is  unable  to  fulfill  her  obligations,  all  her  
32:976:53954:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:counterparts could run into problems, thus spreading the financial instability. 
32:977:54034:24:24:90:529:103:197:Times:197:Times:The  netting,  used  in  most  settlement  systems,  makes  many  transactions  
32:978:54114:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:dependent  on  each  other  and  therefore  amplifies  this  problem.  Second,  a  
33:979:54197:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:dominating  and  increasing  part  of  the  daily  flows  in  the  payment  system  
33:980:54281:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:emanates form the securities markets and the payment system is a vital part 
33:981:54357:24:25:90:522:659:197:Times:197:Times:of   the   financial   infrastructure.   Most   other   activities   rely   on   a   well-
33:982:54447:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:functioning payment system. If the payment system would collapse all other 
33:983:54522:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:economic activity would run into serious problems. It is difficult to imaging 
33:984:54600:24:24:90:530:586:197:Times:197:Times:any  economic  activity,  which  does  not  involve  payments.  Therefore,  a  
33:985:54679:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:disruption  in  the  settlement  of  financial  securities  may  have  far  reaching  
33:986:54765:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:consequences  for  the  entire  economy.  Furthermore,  clearing  and  settlement  
33:987:54848:24:25:90:532:514:197:Times:197:Times:organizations   have   features   similar   to   natural   monopolies.   There   are   
33:988:54935:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:substantial economies of scale. As a consequence, most countries only have 
33:989:55010:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:one settlement organization, at least for the same type of financial securities. 
33:990:55091:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:If  such  an  organization  would  default  due  to  technical  problems  or  fraud,  
33:991:55177:24:24:90:533:417:197:Times:197:Times:settlement   may   be   difficult   and   the   risk   of   major   macroeconomic   
33:992:55261:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:disturbances  is  not  negligible.  There  are  however  not  only  operational  
33:993:55342:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:reasons for systemic risks. Such risks are also present if financial problems 
33:994:55420:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:for one agent involved in the system spread to other agents. The typical way 
33:995:55497:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:to deal with this systemic problem is to set up different forms of prudential 
33:996:55575:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:regulation,  including  stringent  supervision  standards.  Normally  the  central  
33:997:55659:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:bank  assumes  responsibility  of  the  payment  system,  while  the  clearing  and  
33:998:55744:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:settlement  organizations  often  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  general  
33:999:55828:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:financial supervision. Given the special status and importance of the clearing 
33:1000:55907:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:and  settlement  organizations,  it  has  even  been  argued  that  they  should  be  
33:1001:55993:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:governed more like public utilities than as privately held companies. In any 
33:1002:56070:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:case,  by  imposing  regulations  on  the  clearing  and  settlement  as  well  as  the  
33:1003:56159:24:24:90:530:127:197:Times:197:Times:payment  systems,  there  is  clearly  a  risk  of  inducing  moral  hazard,  by  
33:1004:56241:24:24:90:531:103:197:Times:197:Times:increasing   the   agents’   propensity   to   take   risks,   and   thus   raising   the   
33:1005:56333:24:0:90:282:79:197:Times:197:Times:probability of systemic problems. 
34:1006:56367:0:25:90:94:707:197:Times:197:Times: 
34:1007:56367:25:23:90:230:682:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 c)Market Liquidity 
34:1008:56390:23:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:Another  type  of  systemic  risks  emanates  from  the  fact  that  liquidity  in  the  
34:1009:56479:25:24:90:525:634:197:Times:197:Times:securities markets has externality features. “Investors want three things from 
34:1010:56558:24:24:90:525:610:197:Times:197:Times:markets: liquidity, liquidity and liquidity.” As a consequence, most investors 
34:1011:56637:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:will prefer to trade when liquidity is as high as possible, i.e. when and where 
34:1012:56717:24:24:90:530:562:197:Times:197:Times:most  other  investors  trade.  Also,  if  one  agent  supplies  more  liquidity,  
34:1013:56800:24:24:90:529:538:197:Times:197:Times:everybody  gains,  since  the  service  provided  by  the  liquidity  supplier  is  
34:1014:56884:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:available to everybody in the market. Thus, as more traders access a certain 
34:1015:56961:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:trading  system,  the  benefits  for  everybody  in  the  trading  system  will  rise.  
34:1016:57049:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:Also, while trading in a market, or supplying liquidity, agents are not likely 
34:1017:57128:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:to  take  the  aggregated  benefit  to  all  other  agents  of  the  increased  liquidity  
34:1018:57219:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:into  account,  i.e.  liquidity  has  a  positive  externality.  Thus,  market  liquidity  
34:1019:57310:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:feeds  market  liquidity.  However,  there  is  a  backside  of  the  coin  as  well.  If  
34:1020:57401:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:liquidity falls it may also disappear fast. Thus, there is a substantial risk that 
34:1021:57484:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:liquidity  will  dry  up  if  a  crisis  occurs,  in  ways  similar  to  what  happened  at  
34:1022:57577:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:the stock market crash of 1987. In a crisis the cost of supplying liquidity is 
34:1023:57656:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:likely  to  increase.  Thus,  when  liquidity  is  most  needed,  it  may  become  
34:1024:57739:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:increasingly scarce. In this sense the first requirement for a systemic risk is 
34:1025:57819:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:fulfilled,  i.e.  there  is  a  potential  market  failure.  As  a  consequence,  many  
34:1026:57907:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:agents, especially financial intermediaries, are increasingly dependent on the 
34:1027:57986:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:securities  markets  for  funding  and  risk  management.  Liquidity  problems  in  
34:1028:58070:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:the  securities  markets  could  easily  spread  to  the  banking  sector.  Serious  
34:1029:58155:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:disturbances in the securities markets could severely affect the funding of a 
34:1030:58233:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:bank.  Also,  “sale  of  assets  to  cover  funding  needs  may  itself  depress  the  
34:1031:58320:24:24:90:525:103:197:Times:197:Times:value of other holdings, or be impossible due to the market-liquidity crisis”, 
34:1032:58399:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:with contagious effects for the entire banking sector.  If these banks run into 
35:1033:58479:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:problems,  it  may  jeopardize  the  payment  system  with  severe  effects  on  the  
35:1034:58565:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:entire  economy.  Thus,  the  funding  of  and  the  risk  management  systems  in  
35:1035:58649:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:banks  have  become  so  dependent  on  the  securities  markets  that  systemic  
35:1036:58731:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:risks may follow if liquidity falls. As banks are becoming increasingly active 
35:1037:58810:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:in securities business, including issuing, trading, underwriting and providing 
35:1038:58889:24:24:90:404:586:197:Times:197:Times:back-up facilities the potential problems are increasing. 
35:1039:58947:24:25:90:94:562:197:Times:197:Times: 
35:1040:58947:25:23:90:218:537:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 d)Insider trading 
35:1041:58969:23:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:Prohibiting  insiders  from  trading  when  they  have  superior  knowledge,  and  
35:1042:59052:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:forcing them to disclose all their trades are measures aimed at reducing the 
35:1043:59129:24:24:90:530:465:197:Times:197:Times:asymmetric  information  and  restoring  market  confidence  among  market  
35:1044:59205:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:participants  and  the  general  public.  Here,  it  is  not  obvious  that  any  market  
35:1045:59295:24:24:90:532:417:197:Times:197:Times:solution,   such   as   signaling   or   reputation,   would   solve   the   problem.   
35:1046:59383:24:24:90:531:393:197:Times:197:Times:Therefore,   potentially   rules   and   regulations   to   reduce   the   asymmetric   
35:1047:59471:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:information may be welfare increasing, given that a well-functioning market 
35:1048:59547:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:can  be  seen  as  a  public  good.  There  are  four  means  through  which  insider  
35:1049:59634:25:24:90:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:trading  could  potentially  harm  the  company.  First,  insider  trading  may  
35:1050:59715:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:reduce the efficiency of corporate decisions by delaying the transmission of 
35:1051:59792:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:information  within  the  company.  However,  if  a  manager  wants  to  trade  on  
35:1052:59876:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:price  sensitive  information  before  transmitting  it  to  her  superior  –  a  phone  
35:1053:59965:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:call  to  her  broker  would  suffice  and  this  would  not  take  more  than  a  few  
35:1054:60053:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:minutes.  Thus,  the  delay  story  is  not  convincing.  Second,  insider  trading  
35:1055:60138:24:25:90:531:176:197:Times:197:Times:may   increase   the   individual   manager’s   incentives   to   choose   high-risk   
35:1056:60225:25:24:90:528:151:197:Times:197:Times:projects,  where  the  benefits  from  insider  trading  are  larger.  However,  this  
35:1057:60312:24:24:90:532:127:197:Times:197:Times:may   attenuate   the   conflict   that   managers   are   more   risk   averse   than   
35:1058:60401:24:24:90:528:103:197:Times:197:Times:shareholders.  Third,  managers  may  manipulate  share  prices,  by  disclosure  
35:1059:60483:24:0:90:530:79:197:Times:197:Times:policies  etc,  in  order  to  maximize  their  insider  trading  profits  and  at  
36:1060:60567:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:considerable social costs. However, prohibiting insider trading is also costly. 
36:1061:60647:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:Fourth,  insider  trading  may  harm  the  company’s  reputation.  The  main  
36:1062:60725:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:problem  is  that  the  insider  information  is  the  property  of  the  corporation.  
36:1063:60813:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:Therefore the insider trading is primarily a contractual dilemma and could be 
36:1064:60891:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:resolved  through  contracts  between  the  corporation  and  the  user  of  any  
36:1065:60973:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:insider  information.  In  practice,  insider  trading  rules  and  regulations  could  
36:1066:61061:24:24:90:531:562:197:Times:197:Times:entail   establishing   and   verifying   standards   of   information,   supervising   
36:1067:61149:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:disclosure requirements and enforcing obligations to  include audit reports in 
36:1068:61228:24:25:90:319:514:197:Times:197:Times:the annual statements of companies, etc. 
36:1069:61269:25:24:90:94:489:197:Times:197:Times: 
36:1070:61269:24:24:90:202:465:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 e)Externalities 
36:1071:61289:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:There  are  also  other  externality  problems.  As  more  traders  access  a  certain  
36:1072:61377:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:trading  system,  the  benefits  for  everybody  in  the  trading  system  will  rise.  
36:1073:61465:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:Thus,  there  are  clearly  externalities  involved  in  market  liquidity.  One  
36:1074:61547:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:problem with this externality is that it results in a consolidation of trading to 
36:1075:61629:24:25:90:529:345:197:Times:197:Times:a  limited  number  of  trading  venues.  These  concentration  tendencies  are  
36:1076:61710:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:likely to limit competition. Thus, financial markets have a certain number of 
36:1077:61788:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:features  in  common  with  natural  monopolies.  From  economic  theory,  we  
36:1078:61867:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:know that monopolies charge prices that are higher than the socially optimal. 
36:1079:61945:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:This  results  in  a  too  low  production  of  the  services  supplied  by  the  
36:1080:62027:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:monopolist and an economic loss to society and investors. Economic theory 
36:1081:62101:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:indicates  that  the  ideal  situation  is  perfect  competition  on  all  markets.  The  
36:1082:62191:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:concentration  tendencies  described  above  may  be  seen  as  a  market  failure.  
36:1083:62276:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:Put  differently,  if  we  let  the  market  forces  work,  the  competition  between  
36:1084:62363:24:24:90:529:127:197:Times:197:Times:the  providers  of  the  financial  markets  may  be  limited  and  the  level  of  
36:1085:62447:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:financial  services  production  sub-optimal.  The  obvious  regulatory  response  
36:1086:62530:24:0:90:529:79:197:Times:197:Times:is  to  lower  the  barriers  to  entry,  in  order  to  stimulate  competition.  The  
37:1087:62617:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:question  here  is  if  the  concentration  tendencies  are  higher  in  the  securities  
37:1088:62707:24:24:90:529:683:197:Times:197:Times:business  than  in  other  areas.  There  are  surely  also  other  industries  with  
37:1089:62793:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:significant  concentration  tendencies.  However  there  may  be  two  reasons  
37:1090:62873:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:why securities markets are more exposed to this problem than other markets. 
37:1091:62949:24:24:90:532:610:197:Times:197:Times:Firstly,   financial   securities   have   very   low   transaction   costs,   such   as   
37:1092:63040:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:transportation  and  legal  costs.  In  many  other  markets,  these  costs  make  
37:1093:63123:24:24:90:534:562:197:Times:197:Times:market   integration   prohibitively   expensive.   Therefore,   concentrations   
37:1094:63205:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:tendencies  in  securities  market  may  be  large  compared  to  other  markets.  
37:1095:63288:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:Secondly,  securities  regulation  imposed  for  other  reasons  –  may  raise  the  
37:1096:63373:25:24:90:529:489:197:Times:197:Times:barriers-to-entry  and  reduce  competition.  The  traditional  test  of  “fit  and  
37:1097:63458:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:proper”  is  one  example  of  a  regulation,  which  in  this  sense  could  be  
37:1098:63540:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:counterproductive in terms of efficiency. In defining securities regulations, – 
37:1099:63619:24:24:90:532:417:197:Times:197:Times:motivated   for   other   reasons–   it   is   therefore   important   to   take   the   
37:1100:63708:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:concentrations  tendencies  into  account.  Still,  the  main  question  is  whether  
37:1101:63794:24:24:90:533:369:197:Times:197:Times:these   concentrations   tendencies   necessitate   regulation   specific   to   the   
37:1102:63881:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:securities  industry  or  whether  the  general  anti-trust  laws  and  competition  
37:1103:63966:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:regulations are sufficient. There are also other externalities. For example, all 
37:1104:64047:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:market  participants  would  be  better  off  if  everybody  followed  high  ethical  
37:1105:64133:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:standards, but market participants often have strong incentives to break these 
37:1106:64212:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:standards  as  long  as  everybody  else  acts  ethically.  The  result  without  rules  
37:1107:64301:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:and  regulation  may  be  that  many  participants  break  the  ethical  rules  and  
37:1108:64386:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:everybody  is  worse  off.  There  is  a  market  failure  if  the  incentives  of  the  
37:1109:64475:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:market  participants  (be  it  exchanges,  brokers,  major  investors,  corporations  
37:1110:64561:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:etc) are not aligned. The problem is that they cannot coordinate their actions. 
37:1111:64641:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:This  is  a  classical  prisoner’s  dilemma  problem  and  can  be  generalized  to  
37:1112:64726:24:24:90:532:103:197:Times:197:Times:many   situations.   Another   example   of   a   coordination   dilemma   is   the   
37:1113:64812:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:monitoring problem, common to securities markets. The basic problem is the 
38:1114:64887:0:24:90:529:707:197:Times:197:Times:combination  of  three  features.  First,  there  is  a  principal  agent  problem.  
38:1115:64972:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:Investors – the principals – supply capital into corporations but delegate the 
38:1116:65051:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:decisions to the management – the agents. Small investors – the principals – 
38:1117:65127:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:buy  investment  services  from  professional  investors  –  the  agents.  Second,  
38:1118:65211:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:contracts  cannot  specify  all  contingencies,  and  thus  leave  the  agents  with  
38:1119:65297:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:some  freedom  to  deviate  from  what  is  optimal  for  the  principals.  Third  in  
38:1120:65384:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:securities  markets,  the  principals  are  typically  small.  Given  these  features,  
38:1121:65472:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:the  competitive  situation  is  likely  to  result  in  low  levels  of  monitoring,  due  
38:1122:65564:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:to  free  riding.  Contracts  that  align  the  incentives  of  the  agents  and  the  
38:1123:65651:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:principals could potentially be difficult to obtain. An aggregated low level of 
38:1124:65731:24:24:90:531:465:197:Times:197:Times:monitoring   could   therefore   harm   efficiency   and   appropriate   regulation   
38:1125:65817:24:24:90:505:441:197:Times:197:Times:inducing coordination of the monitoring efforts could enhance efficiency. 
38:1126:65891:24:24:90:94:417:197:Times:197:Times: 
38:1127:65891:24:24:90:328:393:197:Times:197:Times:3.3 (f)The Consumer Protection Motive 
38:1128:65929:24:24:90:602:369:197:Times:197:Times:One  frequently  used  argument  for  securities  regulation  and  supervision  is  t                       
38:1129:66037:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:that the consumers need protection. Generally speaking, an efficient way to 
38:1130:66113:25:24:90:528:320:197:Times:197:Times:protect  consumers  in  the  securities  markets  is  to  ensure,  a)  that  the  price  
38:1131:66202:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:formation  process  is  as  efficient  as  possible,  and  b)  that  there  is  sufficient  
38:1132:66294:24:24:90:530:272:197:Times:197:Times:competition  between  the  traders,  brokers  and  other  market  participants.  
38:1133:66375:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:Thus,  if  a  large  number  of  professional  traders  compete  in  assembling  and  
38:1134:66461:24:24:90:531:224:197:Times:197:Times:interpreting  new  information,  securities  market  prices  will  reflect  that  
38:1135:66543:24:24:90:533:200:197:Times:197:Times:information   and   unsophisticated   traders   do   not   need   any   additional   
38:1136:66628:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:information  and  analysis.  In  this  case,  the  observed  prices  are  sufficient.  
38:1137:66715:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:Given that rules and regulations are needed for some other reason, effective 
38:1138:66792:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:ways to protect uniformed traders are therefore to enact measures to reduce 
38:1139:66868:24:24:90:529:103:197:Times:197:Times:transaction  costs,  to  guarantee  efficient  trading  mechanisms,  to  introduce  
38:1140:66952:24:0:90:527:79:197:Times:197:Times:antitrust  policies,  to  lower  barriers  to  entry  and  to  improve  competition.  If  
39:1141:67042:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:the  markets  are  efficient,  all  trades  will  be  performed  at  correct  prices  and  
39:1142:67133:24:24:90:529:683:197:Times:197:Times:the  need  to  protect  consumers  will  in  principle  vanish.  Thus,  one  basic  
39:1143:67217:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:conclusion is that consumers are better protected in an efficient market than 
39:1144:67295:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:in a less efficient market. Thus, an effective way of protecting the consumers 
39:1145:67374:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:is to ensure an efficient market. However, securities markets cannot always 
39:1146:67450:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:be  perfectly  efficient  in  an  informational  sense.  One  of  the  reasons  is  that  
39:1147:67540:24:24:90:529:562:197:Times:197:Times:there  is  asymmetric  information.  The  consumer  protection  argument  for  
39:1148:67619:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:regulation  is  typically  based  on  the  existence  of  asymmetric  information.  
39:1149:67703:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:Price  sensitive  information  is  not  immediately  spread  to  all  traders.  Some  
39:1150:67789:25:24:90:534:489:197:Times:197:Times:investors,   especially   small   investors,   normally   have   less   access   to   
39:1151:67875:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:information  than  other  traders.  As  a  consequence,  securities  regulations  are  
39:1152:67962:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:often aimed at either reducing the asymmetric information between different 
39:1153:68038:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:agents,   or   limiting   the   perceived   damage   of   asymmetric   information.   
39:1154:68124:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:However,  reducing  the  asymmetric  information  may  also  have  significant  
39:1155:68204:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:adverse  effects.  If  the  regulation  prohibits  agents  from  taking  advantage  of  
39:1156:68292:24:25:90:530:345:197:Times:197:Times:superior  information,  this  information  will  not  be  incorporated  into  the  
39:1157:68375:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:securities prices. It is exactly the search for information, not yet reflected in 
39:1158:68457:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:the prices, which makes prices informationally efficient. This search, which 
39:1159:68534:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:is  costly,  has  to  be  profitable  otherwise  prices  will  not  be  as  informative.  
39:1160:68624:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:Therefore, accepting a certain limited level of asymmetric information may 
39:1161:68699:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:be the price we have to pay to get informative prices on a well-functioning 
39:1162:68775:24:24:90:530:200:197:Times:197:Times:market.  There  are  also  other  problems.  The  main  reason  for  investor  
39:1163:68854:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:protection  is  based  on  a  free-riding  problem,  combined  with  a  principal  
39:1164:68937:25:24:90:529:151:197:Times:197:Times:agent  conflict  and  incomplete  contracts.  Principal  agent  relationships  are  
39:1165:69021:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:common  in  securities  markets.  Retail  investors  typically  invest  in  different  
39:1166:69108:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:funds and other financial services firms. Here the former are principals and 
39:1167:69185:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:the latter agents. These investment funds, trusts and financial services firms 
40:1168:69264:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:invest in stocks, bond etc and then act as principals towards the management 
40:1169:69341:24:24:90:528:683:197:Times:197:Times:of  the  issuing  companies  (agents).  Given  that  complete  contracts  are  not  
40:1170:69425:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:feasible or enforceable, that all contingencies cannot be foreseen, and that it 
40:1171:69505:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:is  not  obvious  that  contracts  that  align  the  incentives  are  always  available,  
40:1172:69595:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:there  is  a  potential  economic  problem.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  free  
40:1173:69681:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:market  may  yield  a.  socially  sub-optimal  solution,  and  thus  there  may  be  
40:1174:69766:24:24:90:522:562:197:Times:197:Times:scope for regulations based on the consumer protection motive. socially sub-
40:1175:69842:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:optimal  solution,  and  thus  there  may  be  scope  for  regulations  based  on  the  
40:1176:69930:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:consumer  protection  motive.  The  overall  conclusion  is  therefore  that  the  
40:1177:70013:25:24:90:525:489:197:Times:197:Times:main consumer protection argument for the regulation of investment services 
40:1178:70089:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:is based a) on the principal agent problem between the retail investor and the 
40:1179:70168:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:investment  service  provider,  b)  on  the  difficulty  of  the  retail  investor  to  
40:1180:70256:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:monitor the performance of the service provider, even ex post, c) on the long 
40:1181:70334:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:term  aspect  of  many  investment  services,  and  d)  all  under  the  assumption  
40:1182:70419:24:24:90:530:369:197:Times:197:Times:that  the  public  se0ctor  has  a  responsibility  for  some  minimum  living  
40:1183:70499:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:standards. Another question is then how these problems can be solved. Other 
40:1184:70575:25:24:90:528:320:197:Times:197:Times:Motives  Occasionally  other  motives  for  separate  securities  regulations  are  
40:1185:70659:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:presented,  such  as  competitiveness  and  money  laundering.  Historically,  a  
40:1186:70741:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:number of other politically motivated arguments have been made, including 
40:1187:70815:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:the need to channel funds to politically favored sectors of the economy, or to 
40:1188:70894:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:help  financing  public  deficits.  However  after  the  deregulation  of  securities  
40:1189:70981:24:25:90:426:200:197:Times:197:Times:markets, the latter argument have more or less disappeared.

40:1193:71153:24:24:90:528:103:197:Times:197:Times:lifted  regulation  on  these  transactions,  it  has  become  easier  also  for  drug  
40:1194:71241:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:traders  and  organized  crime  to  use  the  financial  system  to  hide  criminal  
41:1195:71326:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:revenue  and  transform  them  into  legitimate  financial  positions.  Therefore  a  
41:1196:71412:24:24:90:532:683:197:Times:197:Times:number   of   countries   have   imposed   reporting   requirements   for   major   
41:1197:71496:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:currency  transactions.  As  long  as  it  is  only  a  question  of  requirements  to  
41:1198:71584:25:24:90:530:634:197:Times:197:Times:report,  the  costs  are  likely  to  be  small  and  not  to  influence  legitimate  
41:1199:71670:24:24:90:530:610:197:Times:197:Times:transactions  in  any  major  way.  However,  if  additional  restrictions  are  
41:1200:71751:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:imposed,  even  for  ‘good’ causes such as in the combat against terrorism, It

42:1226:72579:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:corporate  governance  problem  perfectly,  or  that  the  corporate  governance

42:1228:72736:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:economic  and  legal  mechanisms  that  can  be  altered  through  the  political  
42:1229:72819:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:process.  Corporate  governance  is  a  straightforward  agency  perspective

43:1250:74019:24:24:90:535:683:197:Times:197:Times:governance    because    of    informational    asymmetries    and    poor    legal,    
43:1251:74107:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:bankruptcy,  and  regulatory  systems.  If  the  world  is  to  rely  on  banks  –  and  
43:1252:74196:25:24:90:525:634:197:Times:197:Times:other financial intermediaries – to exert effective corporate governance, then 
43:1253:74275:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:the managers of financial institutions must themselves face sound corporate 
43:1254:74351:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:governance.  If  bank  managers  face  sound  incentives,  they  will  be  more  
43:1255:74432:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:likely  to  allocate  capital  efficiently  and  then  implement  effective  corporate  
43:1256:74520:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:governance over the firms in which they invest. If bank managers, however, 
43:1257:74594:24:25:90:182:514:197:Times:197:Times:have enormous  
43:1258:74609:25:24:90:525:489:197:Times:197:Times:discretion to act in their own interests rather than the interests of the bank’s 
43:1259:74690:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:equity and debt holders, then this will adversely affect corporate governance. 
43:1260:74769:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:In  particular,  banks  will  allocate  capital  less  efficiently  and  bank  managers  
43:1261:74858:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:may actually induce firm managers to behave in ways that favor the interests 
43:1262:74935:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:of  bank  managers  and  firms  but  hurt  overall  firm  performance.  Thus,  the  
43:1263:75019:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:corporate  governance  of  banks  and  other  financial  intermediaries  is  crucial

43:1265:75193:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:Nevertheless, the financial sector has generally received far less attention in 
43:1266:75273:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:the  corporate  governance  literature  than  seems  warranted  by  their  central  
43:1267:75357:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:role  in  a  nation’s  corporate  governance  system.  How  do  the  suppliers  of  
43:1268:75441:24:24:90:470:248:197:Times:197:Times:capital influence managers to act in the best interests of capitalists? 
43:1269:75513:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:First,  governments  construct  the  basic  legal  system  underpinning  corporate  
43:1270:75597:24:24:90:530:200:197:Times:197:Times:governance.  Second,  governments  may  influence  the  flow  of  corporate  
43:1271:75674:24:25:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:finance  by  restricting  corporate  activities  and  insuring  corporate  finance  in

44:1276:75913:0:24:90:394:707:197:Times:197:Times:4.2 Problems of Corporate Governance in Finance 
44:1277:75961:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:In  particular,  we  examine  three  interrelated  characteristics  of  financial  
44:1278:76044:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:intermediaries and how these traits affect corporate governance. First, banks 
44:1279:76122:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:and  other  intermediaries  are  more  opaque,  which  fundamentally  intensifies  
44:1280:76205:24:24:90:531:610:197:Times:197:Times:the  agency  problem.  Due  to  greater  information  asymmetries  between  
44:1281:76281:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:insiders  and  outside  investors  in  banking,  it  is  (i)  more  difficult  for  equity  
44:1282:76373:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:and debt holders to monitor managers and use incentive contracts, (ii) easier 
44:1283:76451:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:for  managers  and  large  investors  to  exploit  the  private  benefits  of  control,  
44:1284:76540:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:rather than maximize value, (iii) unlikely that potential outside bidders with 
44:1285:76619:25:24:90:529:489:197:Times:197:Times:poor  information  will  generate  a  sufficiently  effective  takeover  threat  to  
44:1286:76704:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:improve  governance  substantially,  and  (iv)  likely  that  a  more  monopolistic  
44:1287:76789:24:24:90:530:441:197:Times:197:Times:sector  will  ensue  and  will  generate  less  corporate  governance  through  
44:1288:76869:24:24:90:534:417:197:Times:197:Times:product   market   competition,   compared   with   an   industry   with   less   
44:1289:76951:24:24:90:529:393:197:Times:197:Times:informational  asymmetries.  Second,  banks,  like  most  intermediaries,  are  
44:1290:77031:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:heavily  regulated  and  this  frequently  impedes  natural  corporate  governance  
44:1291:77115:24:25:90:530:345:197:Times:197:Times:mechanisms.  For  instance,  (i)  deposit  insurance  reduces  monitoring  by  
44:1292:77194:25:24:90:528:320:197:Times:197:Times:insured  depositors,  reduces  the  desirability  of  banks  to  raise  capital  from  
44:1293:77281:24:24:90:533:296:197:Times:197:Times:large,   uninsured   creditors   with   incentives   to   monitor,   and   increases   
44:1294:77368:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:incentives for shifting bank assets to more risky investments, (ii) regulatory 
44:1295:77447:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:restrictions on the concentration of ownership interfere with one of the main 
44:1296:77525:24:24:90:535:224:197:Times:197:Times:mechanisms    for    exerting    corporate    governance    around    the    world:    
44:1297:77612:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:concentrated ownership, (iii) regulatory restrictions on entry, takeovers, and 
44:1298:77691:24:25:90:531:176:197:Times:197:Times:bank  activities  reduce  competition,  which  reduce  market  pressures  on  
44:1299:77769:25:24:90:529:151:197:Times:197:Times:managers  to  maximize  profits,  and  (iv)  bank  regulators  and  supervisors  
44:1300:77850:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:frequently  have  their  own  incentives  in  influencing  bank  managers  that  do  
44:1301:77935:24:24:90:528:103:197:Times:197:Times:not  coincide  with  value  maximization.  Finally,  government  ownership  of  
44:1302:78015:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:banks  fundamentally  alters  the  corporate  governance  equation.  Since  state  
45:1303:78098:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:ownership  of  banks  remains  large  in  many  countries,  this  makes  corporate  
45:1304:78182:24:25:90:496:683:197:Times:197:Times:governance of the banking industry very different from other industries. 
45:1305:78255:25:24:90:94:658:197:Times:197:Times: 
45:1306:78255:24:17:90:394:634:197:Times:197:Times:4.3 Strategy for improving Corporate Governance 
45:1307:78303:17:7:90:99:617:81:Times:81:Times:23
45:1308:78305:7:24:99:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:Existing  research  shows  that  countries  in  which  the  government  supports  
45:1309:78387:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:the  ability  of  private  sector  entities  to  monitor  banks,  permits  banks  to  
45:1310:78473:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:engage in a wide-range of activities, in banking. As a first step, it is critical 
45:1311:78555:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:that governments recognize and curb any of their own behaviors that thwarts 
45:1312:78631:24:25:90:530:514:197:Times:197:Times:the  private  sector’s  ability  and  incentive  to  monitor  banks.  Thus,  for  
45:1313:78713:25:24:90:531:489:197:Times:197:Times:example,  in  countries  in  which  government  ownership  is  pronounced,  
45:1314:78789:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:private sector monitoring cannot be expected, and competitive forces clearly 
45:1315:78866:24:24:90:532:441:197:Times:197:Times:are   blocked.   Moreover,   as   argued   above,   government   supervision   of   
45:1316:78950:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:government  banks  also  cannot  be  expected  to  be  thorough  and  independent  
45:1317:79033:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:as  we  observe  in  India.  In  these  cases,  embarking  on  a  program  to  reduce  
45:1318:79120:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:government  ownership  where  it  is  pronounced  would  seem  to  be  essential;  
45:1319:79203:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:without  this  step  it  is  difficult  to  conceive  of  the  success  of  other  efforts  to  
45:1320:79299:25:24:90:533:320:197:Times:197:Times:ameliorate   the   governance   problem.   Countries   with   blanket   deposit   
45:1321:79381:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:insurance,  or  extremely  generous  deposit  insurance  coverage  (certainly  the  
45:1322:79465:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:levels  of  10  to  15  times  per  capita  GDP  that  are  found  in  very  low  income  
45:1323:79555:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:countries)  also  are  sure  to  be  those  in  which  private  sector  monitoring  is  
45:1324:79643:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:virtually  nonexistent.  Reducing  such  coverage  to  much  lower  levels  also  
45:1325:79725:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:would  be  essential  in  order  to  enhance  private  sector  monitoring.  A  second  
45:1326:79812:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:step  in  improving  governance  in  banking  involves  directly  reducing  the  
45:1327:79893:25:20:90:533:151:197:Times:197:Times:opacity   of   banks   by   improving   the   flow   of   information.   Although   
45:1328:79977:20:9:90:236:131:99:Times:99:Times:                                                           
45:1329:80035:9:24:90:510:122:81:Times:99:Times:23 Caprio, Gerard Jr. and Ross Levine, “Corporate Governance In Finance: Concepts and International 
45:1330:80134:24:18:90:176:98:99:Times:99:Times:Observations”(2002) 
45:1331:80154:18:0:90:92:80:99:Times:99:Times: 
46:1332:80154:0:24:90:531:707:197:Times:197:Times:transparency  of  banking  information  in  emerging  markets  is  receiving  
46:1333:80232:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:increased attention in the wake of the East Asian crisis (and perhaps more so 
46:1334:80310:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:in  the  aftermath  of  the  Enron  collapse),  the  likely  reinforcement  of  opacity  
46:1335:80399:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:by existing ownership patterns in emerging markets suggests that this task is 
46:1336:80477:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:even  more  important  and  yet  more  difficult  than  has  been  recognized.  In  
46:1337:80561:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:effect,  authorities  will  need  to  engage  in  the  unpopular  task  of  shaking-up  
46:1338:80649:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:cozy relationships among powerful interest groups in their society. This task 
46:1339:80727:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:is not as simple as superficial adherence to international standards; rather, it 
46:1340:80808:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:is a process that will require sustained commitment over a period of time in 
46:1341:80885:25:24:90:532:489:197:Times:197:Times:order   to   effect.   In   addition   to   much   greater   attention   to   improving   
46:1342:80975:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:accounting  and  auditing,  improvements  to  credit  information  will  facilitate  
46:1343:81060:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:the expansion of banking by those interested in providing finance to groups 
46:1344:81136:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:that were previously excluded. Enhancing corporate finance reporting in the 
46:1345:81212:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:media,  and  education  as  to  the  importance  of  this  issue  in  a  wide  swath  of  
46:1346:81302:24:24:90:530:369:197:Times:197:Times:civil  society,  will  help  make  a  lasting  contribution  to  better  corporate  
46:1347:81386:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:governance. This is not easy: the same family groups that control banks may 
46:1348:81462:25:24:90:528:320:197:Times:197:Times:also  control  the  media,  so  broader  antitrust  activity  may  be  necessary  in  
46:1349:81548:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:order  to  make  this  work.  Moreover,  it  is  worth  stressing  again  that  these  
46:1350:81635:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:changes  will  not  happen  to  the  extent  that  governments  underwrite  risk.  
46:1351:81718:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:Third, although better information may indirectly enhance the contestability 
46:1352:81795:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:of  the  banking  market  and  invigorate  the  market  for  corporate  control  in  
46:1353:81880:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:banking,  opening  to  foreign  banks  offers  a  direct  mechanism  for  creating  
46:1354:81964:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:competitive pressures in banking. It was not so much the presence of foreign 
46:1355:82041:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:banks  as  the  contestability  of  markets  (associated  with  relative  openness  to  
46:1356:82129:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:foreign entry) that contributed to the development and stability of emerging 
46:1357:82206:24:20:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:market  banking.  Foreign  banks,  and  indeed  foreign  entry  in  other  markets,  
46:1358:82291:20:12:90:524:83:99:Times:99:Times:                                                                                                                                                                             
46:1359:82463:12:0:90:92:71:99:Times:99:Times: 
47:1360:82463:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:will  serve  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  the  economy  in  general  and  
47:1361:82548:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:lessen  the  reliance  on  family  or  conglomerates  relationships.  Increased  
47:1362:82629:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:foreign  presence  in  emerging  market  banking  has  the  attractive  benefit  of  
47:1363:82714:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:improving access to credit, even by small and medium-sized enterprises. The 
47:1364:82790:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:resulting  increase  in  competition  in  the  economy  can  pay  dividends  in  the  
47:1365:82876:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:long-term to the corporate governance problems discussed here. Clearly the 
47:1366:82951:24:24:90:532:562:197:Times:197:Times:same   should   apply   to   foreign   competition   in   insurance   and   pension   
47:1367:83037:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:management. Fourth and most importantly, the potential monitors of banks – 
47:1368:83111:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:owners,  markets  (large  creditors  in  particular)  and  supervisors  –  need  clear  
47:1369:83199:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:and strong incentives to do their jobs well. As stressed above, the legal and 
47:1370:83277:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:bankruptcy  systems  do  not  operate  well  in  many  countries.  Thus,  bank  
47:1371:83357:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:managers  can  control  banks  with  little  to  fear  from  outsider  investors,  or  
47:1372:83444:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:even  from  bankruptcy  as  is  clearly  evident  from  Japan’s  ten-year  banking  
47:1373:83528:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:crisis. Owners, particularly controlling shareholders, will have the incentive 
47:1374:83607:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:to  monitor  their  banks  well  (meaning  in  accordance  with  society’s  goals),  
47:1375:83692:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:only to the extent that their own resources are really at risk and to the extent 
47:1376:83773:25:24:90:531:320:197:Times:197:Times:that   there   are   healthy   profits   in   return   for   safe   and   sound   banking.   
47:1377:83866:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:Unfortunately,  ensuring  that  capital  is  real  and  that  weak  lending  practices  
47:1378:83954:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:have  not  eroded  is  not  simple  in  practice.  The  incentives  facing  insider  
47:1379:84039:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:owners and managers can be enhanced in a number of ways. The ability of 
47:1380:84111:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:authorities to influence inside owners and managers is enhanced if regulators 
47:1381:84189:24:24:90:530:200:197:Times:197:Times:can  impose  penalties  when  there  is  evidence  of  fraud  or  of  improper  
47:1382:84269:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:conduct. Similarly, the incentives of inside owners and managers will clearly 
47:1383:84347:25:24:90:530:151:197:Times:197:Times:be  enhanced  if  small  shareholders  and  debtors  can  confidently  use  an  
47:1384:84427:24:24:90:528:127:197:Times:197:Times:efficient  court  system  that  supports  their  rights.More  generally,  regulation  
47:1385:84513:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:has not focused much attention on the compensation of senior managers. For 
47:1386:84588:24:0:90:527:79:197:Times:197:Times:example,  an  attempt  to  vary  capital  requirements  in  line  with  the  extent  to  
48:1387:84677:0:24:90:525:707:197:Times:197:Times:which banks’ compensation policies encourage or discourage excessive risk 
48:1388:84751:24:24:90:525:683:197:Times:197:Times:taking is a promising area for new research. The supervisory process in some 
48:1389:84828:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:countries is getting close to this issue when supervisors examine the systems 
48:1390:84906:25:24:90:530:634:197:Times:197:Times:that  banks  have  in  place  for  managing  their  risks.  We  suspect  that  as  
48:1391:84989:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:important  as  risk  management  is  as  a  process,  the  incentives  inside  the  
48:1392:85073:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:individual banks for taking risk will determine the efficacy of any processes 
48:1393:85151:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:that  are  written  down.  Certainly,  the  threat  of  legal  recourse  for  those  who  
48:1394:85241:24:24:90:530:538:197:Times:197:Times:suffer  losses  when  directors  do  not  fulfill  their  fiduciary  duties  would  
48:1395:85325:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:improve  the  incentives  for  this  group,  and  it  might  also  encourage  them  to  
48:1396:85413:25:24:90:533:489:197:Times:197:Times:support   reforms   in   compensation   policies   for   senior   bank   officers.   
48:1397:85498:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:Compensation policies of directors themselves also demand greater attention 
48:1398:85574:24:24:90:532:441:197:Times:197:Times:and   further   research      into   the   extent   to   which   bank   and   corporate   
48:1399:85664:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:performance is a function of differences in this area would be highly useful. 
48:1400:85742:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:To improve corporate governance of financial intermediaries, policy makers 
48:1401:85817:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:must seek to enhance the ability and incentives of creditors and other market 
48:1402:85895:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:participants  to  monitor  banks.  Recently,  subordinated  debt  proposals  have  
48:1403:85978:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:received increased attention. It should be clear that the governance problem 
48:1404:86055:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:in  finance  is  severe,  but  it  is  not  hopeless.  Recognition  of  the  difficulty  of  
48:1405:86148:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:the  process,  and  the  need  to  get  governments  focused  on.  Better-governed  
48:1406:86232:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:banks, in the sense of those able to contribute to development yet also robust 
48:1407:86311:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:to macro disturbances, used to be more common. Notwithstanding, waves of 
48:1408:86384:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:failure by small U.S. banks in the nineteenth century, depositor losses in the 
48:1409:86463:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:now industrialized countries were minor and taxpayers’ losses nil. This state 
48:1410:86541:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:of affairs resulted from clear incentives for the various actors reviewed here, 
48:1411:86621:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:not  least  of  which  was  the  practice  for  bonds  to  be  posted  by  bankers  and  
48:1412:86710:24:0:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:even deferred compensation for supervisors. We can only hope that the scale 
49:1413:86786:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:of losses in emerging market banking and the consequent increased attention 
49:1414:86862:24:25:90:348:683:197:Times:197:Times:to this topic will help promote reform efforts.

49:1417:86944:17:7:90:99:617:81:Times:81:Times:24
49:1418:86946:7:24:99:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:In  India  recently  ,March  2003,  a  committee  has  been  formed  by  SEBI  to  
49:1419:87029:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:discuss  the  scope  of  Corporate  Governance  in  India  which  is  headed  by  
49:1420:87111:24:24:90:322:562:197:Times:197:Times:the CEO of Infosys,Narayana Murthy. 
49:1421:87147:24:24:90:300:538:197:Times:197:Times:Excerpts from the Committee report: 
49:1422:87183:24:25:90:520:514:197:Times:197:Times:A corporation is a congregation of various stakeholders, namely, customers, 
49:1423:87259:25:24:90:534:489:197:Times:197:Times:employees,    investors,    vendor    partners,    government    and    society.    A    
49:1424:87348:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:corporation  should  be  fair  and  transparent  to  its  stakeholders  in  all  its  
49:1425:87434:24:24:90:529:441:197:Times:197:Times:transactions.  This  has  become  imperative  in  today’s  globalized  business  
49:1426:87515:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:world  where  corporations  need  to  access  global  pools  of  capital,  need  to  
49:1427:87600:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:attract  and  retain  the  best  human  capital  from  various  parts  of  the  world,  
49:1428:87688:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:need  to  partner  with  vendors  on  mega  collaborations  and  need  to  live  in  
49:1429:87773:24:25:90:533:345:197:Times:197:Times:harmony   with   the   community.   Unless   a   corporation   embraces   and   
49:1430:87853:25:24:90:427:320:197:Times:197:Times:demonstrates ethical conduct, it will not be able to succeed. 
49:1431:87915:24:24:90:531:296:197:Times:197:Times:Corporate   governance   is   about   ethical   conduct   in   business.   Ethics   is   
49:1432:88004:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:concerned  with  the  code  of  values  and  principles  that  enables  a  person  to  
49:1433:88091:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:choose  between  right  and  wrong,  and  therefore,  select  from  alternative  
49:1434:88172:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:courses  of  action.  Further,  ethical  dilemmas  arise  from  conflicting  interests  
49:1435:88260:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:of the parties involved. In this regard, managers make decisions based on a 
49:1436:88336:24:56:90:530:176:197:Times:197:Times:set  of  principles  influenced  by  the  values,  context  and  culture  of  the

50:1441:88573:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:organization.  Ethical  leadership  is  good  for  business  as  the  organization  is  
50:1442:88661:24:24:90:523:683:197:Times:197:Times:seen to conduct its business in line with the expectations of all stakeholders.  
50:1443:88742:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:Corporate governance is beyond the realm of law. It stems from the culture 
50:1444:88817:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:and  mindset  of  management,  and  cannot  be  regulated  by  legislation  alone.  
50:1445:88901:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:Corporate  governance  deals  with  conducting  the  affairs  of  a  company  such  
50:1446:88985:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:that  there  is  fairness  to  all  stakeholders  and  that  its  actions  benefit  the  
50:1447:89074:24:24:90:532:562:197:Times:197:Times:greatest   number   of   stakeholders.   It   is   about   openness,   integrity   and   
50:1448:89163:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:accountability. What legislation can and should do is to lay down a common 
50:1449:89238:24:25:90:525:514:197:Times:197:Times:framework – the “form” to ensure standards. The “substance” will ultimately 
50:1450:89314:25:24:90:532:489:197:Times:197:Times:determine   the   credibility   and   integrity   of   the   process.   Substance   is   
50:1451:89403:24:24:90:530:465:197:Times:197:Times:inexorably  linked  to  the  mindset  and  ethical  standards  of  management  
50:1452:89482:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:Corporations need to recognize that their growth requires the cooperation of 
50:1453:89559:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:all  the  stakeholders;  and  such  cooperation  is  enhanced  by  the  corporation  
50:1454:89644:24:24:90:529:393:197:Times:197:Times:adhering  to  the  best  corporate  governance  practices.  In  this  regard,  the  
50:1455:89728:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:management needs to act as trustees of the shareholders at large and prevent 
50:1456:89805:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:asymmetry  of  benefits  between  various  sections  of  shareholders,  especially  
50:1457:89889:25:24:90:439:320:197:Times:197:Times:between the owner-managers and the rest of the shareholders. 
50:1458:89950:24:24:90:532:296:197:Times:197:Times:Corporate   governance   is   a   key   element   in   improving   the   economic   
50:1459:90034:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:efficiency  of  a  firm.  Good  corporate  governance  also  helps  ensure  that  
50:1460:90116:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:corporations take into account the interests of a wide range of constituencies, 
50:1461:90196:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:as well as of the communities within which they operate. Further, it ensures 
50:1462:90273:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:that  their  Boards  are  accountable  to  the  shareholders.  This,  in  turn,  helps  
50:1463:90361:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:assure that corporations operate for the benefit of society as a whole. While 
50:1464:90439:25:24:90:530:151:197:Times:197:Times:large  profits  can  be  made  taking  advantage  of  the  asymmetry  between  
50:1465:90518:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:stakeholders in the short run, balancing the interests of all stakeholders alone 
50:1466:90599:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:will ensure survival and growth in the long run. This includes, for instance, 
50:1467:90677:24:0:90:489:79:197:Times:197:Times:taking into account societal concerns about labor and the environment. 
51:1468:90748:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:Often,  increased  attention  on  corporate  governance  is  a  result  of  financial  
51:1469:90835:24:24:90:531:683:197:Times:197:Times:crisis.   For   instance,   the   Asian   financial   crisis   brought   the   subject   of   
51:1470:90929:24:25:90:531:659:197:Times:197:Times:corporate   governance   to   the   surface   in   Asia.   Further,   recent   scandals   
51:1471:91019:25:24:90:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:disturbed  the  otherwise  placid  and  complacent  corporate  landscape  in  the  
51:1472:91102:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:US. These scandals, in a sense, proved to be serendipitous. They spawned a 
51:1473:91177:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:new set of initiatives in corporate governance in the US and triggered fresh 
51:1474:91254:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:debate  in  the  European  Union  as  well  as  in  Asia.  The  many  instances  of  
51:1475:91339:24:24:90:525:538:197:Times:197:Times:corporate misdemeanours have also shifted the emphasis on compliance with 
51:1476:91413:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:substance,  rather  than  form,  and  brought  to  sharper  focus  the  need  for  
51:1477:91496:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:intellectual honesty and integrity. This is because financial and non-financial 
51:1478:91576:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:disclosures  made  by  any  firm  are  only  as  good  and  honest  as  the  people  
51:1479:91661:24:24:90:532:441:197:Times:197:Times:behind   them.   By   this   very   principle,   only   those   industrialists   whose   
51:1480:91750:24:24:90:530:417:197:Times:197:Times:corporations  are  governed  properly  should  be  allowed  to  be  a  part  of  
51:1481:91831:24:24:90:525:393:197:Times:197:Times:committees.   This   includes   the   Prime   Minister   and   Finance   Minister’s 
51:1482:91915:24:24:90:531:369:197:Times:197:Times:advisory   councils,   committees   set   up   by   the   Confederation   of   Indian

52:1497:92252:24:24:90:530:633:197:Times:197:Times:The  security  scams  and  financial  scandals  discussed  here  involved  the  
52:1498:92332:24:24:90:529:609:197:Times:197:Times:manipulation  of  huge  amounts  of  money.  The  purpose  of  the  so  called  
52:1499:92412:24:24:90:529:585:197:Times:197:Times:“traders”    or  “investors”  was  not  genuine.  The  perpetrators  had  such  a  
52:1500:92495:24:25:90:526:561:197:Times:197:Times:comprehensive knowledge of how the system worked that they manipulated 
52:1501:92566:25:24:90:526:536:197:Times:197:Times:it. It is clearly evident that the occurrence and reoccurrence of such security 
52:1502:92646:24:24:90:526:512:197:Times:197:Times:scams and financial scandals as some point in time be attributed to a failure 
52:1503:92724:24:24:90:532:488:197:Times:197:Times:of   corporate   governance   in   finance   and   that   of   financial   regulation.   
52:1504:92813:24:24:90:529:464:197:Times:197:Times:Corporate  Governance  vs  Financial  Regulation  is more  a  personal  thing  
52:1505:92892:24:24:90:528:440:197:Times:197:Times:which  involves  the  adherence  to  rules  regulations  and  ethics  by  officials  
52:1506:92977:24:24:90:527:416:197:Times:197:Times:(management).It  is  more  self  enforced  as  a  ethical  behavior  or  a  matter  of  
52:1507:93065:24:25:90:530:392:197:Times:197:Times:pursuing  codes  of  conduct  without  an  outside  agent  monitoring  ,  but  
52:1508:93144:25:24:90:528:367:197:Times:197:Times:financial  market  regulation  in  exercised  more  by  an  external  organization  
52:1509:93228:24:24:90:527:343:197:Times:197:Times:either  a  regulatory  body  authorized  to  monitor  and  impose    a  surveillance  
52:1510:93314:24:24:90:528:319:197:Times:197:Times:mechanism    to  ensure  frauds  or  misdemeanors  are  not  perpetuated  and  so  
52:1511:93397:24:24:90:527:295:197:Times:197:Times:that the market functions efficiently to over see the functions of the market

52:1513:93561:18:31:90:532:253:81:Times:197:Times:25Though   standard   corporate   governance   theory   states   that   corporate   
52:1514:93645:31:24:90:528:222:197:Times:197:Times:governance  includes  the  role  that  equity  and  debt  holders  have  to  play  in

52:1516:93822:24:24:90:527:174:197:Times:197:Times:should  not  be  forgotten  that  it  also  includes  the  role  that  creditors,  owners

53:1525:94346:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:diligence  and  sincerity  of  management  when  it  comes  to  the  adherence  to  
53:1526:94430:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:rules  and  regulation.  Also  they  must  have  a  concern  for  the  welfare  of  
53:1527:94514:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:shareholders(investors) and other suppliers of capital to ensure that they get 
53:1528:94593:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:a  fair  and  regular  return  for  their  investments.  While  corporate  governance  
53:1529:94680:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:ensures  a  regular  supply  of  capital  and  fair  share  of  profit  to  investors  it's  
53:1530:94773:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:role  does  not  end  there.  Corporate  Governance  at  that  level  does  not  mean  
53:1531:94860:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:that it is entirely solved but definitely can be improved on. Shareholders and 
53:1532:94939:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:other  parties  find  difficulty  in  exercising  corporate  governance  because  of  
53:1533:95025:24:24:90:529:465:197:Times:197:Times:poor  legal  systems,  corruption  and  bankruptcy.  Also  managers  have  the  
53:1534:95105:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:incentive  to  act  in  their  own  interests  rather  than  the  interests  of  equity  and  
53:1535:95199:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:debt  holders  which  could  definitely  affect  corporate  governance.  Also  
53:1536:95278:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:informational asymmetries in the system make it difficult for equity and debt 
53:1537:95356:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:holders to monitor mangers. It also induces bank mangers to act according to 
53:1538:95433:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:their  own  incentives  and  not  according  to  value  maximization.  Also  heavy  
53:1539:95517:25:24:90:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:regulation  induces  bankers  to  invest  in  high  risk  ventures  rather  than  
53:1540:95599:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:borrowing  from  uninsured  borrowers  who  have  a  greater  incentive  monitor  
53:1541:95681:24:24:90:531:272:197:Times:197:Times:.Also   regulations   and   prohibitions   of   entry   of   foreign   banks   reduces   
53:1542:95770:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:competition  and  market  pressures  on  managers  to  earn  profits.  Corporate  
53:1543:95852:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:Governance problem can be improved by increasing private monitoring and 
53:1544:95924:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:reducing  government  ownership  when  it  interferes  with  private  monitoring.  
53:1545:96007:24:25:90:532:176:197:Times:197:Times:The   opacity   of   banking   processes   should   be   removed   and   a   proper   
53:1546:96093:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:information flow should ensue. A lack of this can be attributed to the Asian 
53:1547:96170:24:24:90:531:127:197:Times:197:Times:Crisis   and   collapse   of   Enron.   Entry   of   foreign   banks   should   induce   
53:1548:96259:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:competition  and  make  mangers  do  their  job  well  without  relying  on  family  
53:1549:96344:24:0:90:529:79:197:Times:197:Times:conglomerates  and  politicians.  Also  managers  in  banks  should  be  given  
54:1550:96424:0:24:90:529:707:197:Times:197:Times:strong  incentives  to  do  their  jobs  well  and  their  good  efforts  should  be  
54:1551:96510:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:rewarded and mistakes corrected. They should be remunerated well. In India 
54:1552:96585:24:25:90:534:659:197:Times:197:Times:corporate   governance   revolves   around   ethical   behavior   on   part   of   
54:1553:96668:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:management,  knowing  to  make  right  decisions  and  also  knowing  to  choose  
54:1554:96750:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:between  right  and  wrong..  It  also  calls  for  the  managers  to  behave  in  the  
54:1555:96838:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:interests of economics efficiency of the firm and shareholders. Management 
54:1556:96913:24:24:90:525:562:197:Times:197:Times:should be made more accountable for their actions in terms of deployment of 
54:1557:96989:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:funds , making decisions and also transmitting information. However though 
54:1558:97064:24:25:90:530:514:197:Times:197:Times:standard  corporate  governance  theory  states  that  it's  realms  of  control  
54:1559:97146:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:include assuring a fair return to suppliers of capital it's scope has changed in 
54:1560:97227:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:recent  years.  Often,  increased  attention  on  corporate  governance  is  a  result  
54:1561:97315:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:of financial crisis. For instance, the Asian financial crisis brought the subject 
54:1562:97397:24:24:90:529:417:197:Times:197:Times:of  corporate  governance  to  the  surface  in  Asia.  Further,  recent  scandals  
54:1563:97481:24:18:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:disturbed  the  otherwise  placid  and  complacent  corporate  landscape  in  the  
54:1564:97564:18:30:90:526:375:81:Times:197:Times:26US. These scandals, in a sense, proved to be serendipitous. They spawned 
54:1565:97639:30:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:a new set of initiatives in corporate governance in the US and triggered fresh 
54:1566:97718:25:0:90:386:320:197:Times:197:Times:debate  in  the  European  Union  as  well  as  in  Asia.

54:1568:97779:7:24:394:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:One  cannot  forget  the  
54:1569:97805:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:security  scams  in  India.  The  many  instances  of  corporate  misdemeanors  
54:1570:97885:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:have  also  shifted  the  emphasis  on  compliance  with  substance,  rather  than  
54:1571:97969:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:form,  and  brought  to  sharper  focus  the  need  for  intellectual  honesty  and  
54:1572:98054:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:integrity.  This  is  because  financial  and  non-financial  disclosures  made  by  
54:1573:98139:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:any  firm  are  only  as  good  and  honest  as  the  people  behind  them.  By  this  
54:1574:98226:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:very  principle,  only  those  industrialists  whose  corporations  are  governed  
54:1575:98309:25:0:90:414:151:197:Times:197:Times:properly  should  be  allowed  to  be  a  part  of  committees.

71:1970:106682:0:24:90:233:707:197:Times:197:Times:A1) Recommendations  
71:1971:106703:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:Based  on  the  committee’s  preliminary  findings  it  made  the  following  
71:1972:106781:24:25:90:193:659:197:Times:197:Times:recommendations 
71:1973:106797:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:(1)The  diversion  of  funds  has  been  largely  facilitated  by  the  practice  of  
71:1974:106883:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:banks  executing  a  large  number  of  “ready  forward”  and  “double  ready  
71:1975:106962:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:forward”  transactions  .  Since  there  is  no  permanent  sale  of  transfer  of  
71:1976:107046:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:investments  in  such  cases  ,there  is  no  real  need  to  effect  transfer  of  actual  
71:1977:107138:24:18:90:530:538:197:Times:197:Times:scrips  of  SGL  forms  or  to  deposit  SGL  forms  when  issued  with  the  
71:1978:107216:18:31:90:527:520:81:Times:197:Times:30PDO(Public  Debt  Office-that  which  records  all  the  banks  transactions  in  
71:1979:107300:31:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:government securities). These transactions have, therefore, presumably been 
71:1980:107376:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:supported  by  BRs  or  SGL(ledger  accounts  maintained  by  the  PDO  which  
71:1981:107455:24:24:90:535:441:197:Times:197:Times:records    all    the    banks    transactions    in    government    securities    with    
71:1982:107547:24:24:90:533:417:197:Times:197:Times:balances)forms   not   intended   to   be   deposited   with   the   PDO.As   the   
71:1983:107631:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:transactions  effectively  get  reversed  on  the  due  date,  it  is  also  possible  that  
71:1984:107724:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:the  transactions  were  effected  without  the  sale  of  BRs  ,SGL  forms  by  the  
71:1985:107810:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:issue of unauthorized BRs or SGL forms. A “ready forward” transaction in 
71:1986:107883:25:24:90:529:320:197:Times:197:Times:substance  could  also  be  a  mere  lending  of  funds  for  the  period    of  the

73:2046:111740:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:PSU  bonds  may  have  been  justified  by  the  banks  on  the  ground  that  there  
73:2047:111826:24:24:90:525:127:197:Times:197:Times:has been undue delay in the issue of scrips by the PSUs and therefore trading 
73:2048:111904:24:24:90:528:103:197:Times:197:Times:in  such  bonds  has  been  possible  only  through  BRs.  The  issue  of  a  large  
73:2049:111989:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:number of BRs in respect of units may also have been justified by the banks 
74:2050:112065:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:on the ground that the transfer of the units in the name of the  buyer involves 
74:2051:112145:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:stamp  duty  and  therefore  transfers  need  to  be  effected  only  when  the  units  
74:2052:112233:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:need  to  be  lodged  with  the  UTI  payment  of  dividend.  These  are  no  doubt  
74:2053:112318:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:valid  assertions  but  the  practice  of  issuance  of  BRs  in  respect  of  these  
74:2054:112404:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:instruments  have  been  largely  responsible  for  the  diversion  of  funds  to  the  
74:2055:112492:24:24:90:139:586:197:Times:197:Times:brokers; 
74:2056:112501:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:         (9)The issuance of BRs in respect of Government securities as also the 
74:2057:112581:24:24:90:529:538:197:Times:197:Times:apparent  short-trading  has  been  sought  to  be  justified  by  the  banks  on  
74:2058:112664:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:grounds  of  the  inability  of  the  PDOs  in  the  RBI  to  record  speedily  the  
74:2059:112749:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:transactions effected and to communicate the credit advices in time to banks. 
74:2060:112827:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:Banks,  therefore  do  not  know  the  fate  of  SGL  forms  lodged  when  they  in  
74:2061:112912:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:turn issue SGL forms. The Committee is not convinced that this justification 
74:2062:112989:24:24:90:535:417:197:Times:197:Times:is    valid    particularly    since    objection    memos    have    generally    been    
74:2063:113080:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:communicated  in  time.  However  ,the  work  of  the  PDOs  needs  to  be  
74:2064:113156:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:considerably speeded up and more relevant information furnished to banks. 
74:2065:113230:24:25:90:278:345:197:Times:197:Times:This information should include; 
74:2066:113263:25:24:108:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:(a)   immediate  advice  of  all  objection  memos.  Unless  a  bank  makes  
74:2067:113339:24:24:126:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:arrangements  on    a  regular  basis  to  collect  objection  memos  over  the  
74:2068:113420:24:24:126:534:272:197:Times:197:Times:PDO    counter    the    advices    should    be    by    courier    for    which    
74:2069:113505:24:24:126:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:acknowledgement  would  be  debited  to  the  account  of  the  concerned  
74:2070:113580:24:24:126:161:224:197:Times:197:Times:bank; 
74:2071:113586:24:24:108:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:(b) a  weekly  statement  of  all  transactions  in  individual  ledger  accounts  
74:2072:113668:24:25:126:317:176:197:Times:197:Times:together with the balance thereof. 
74:2073:113703:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:It  is  also  necessary  that  there  is  a  daily  verification  of  all  securities  held  in  
74:2074:113800:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:the  SGL  accounts  of  all  banks  in  the  aggregate  and  that  on  a  weekly  basis  
74:2075:113889:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:the PDO submit to the Department of Banking Operations and Development 
74:2076:113960:24:0:90:527:79:197:Times:197:Times:(DBOD)  of  the  RBI  a  report  giving  bank-wise  details  of  all  SGLs  returned  
75:2077:114046:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:for  want  of  sufficient  balance.The  Committee  believes  that  given  the  large  
75:2078:114132:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:number of accounts the large number of individual securities and the number 
75:2079:114208:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:of transactions, the work of the PDO cannot be done manually and needs to 
75:2080:114282:25:24:90:264:634:197:Times:197:Times:be immediately computerized. 
75:2081:114311:24:24:108:525:610:197:Times:197:Times:              (10)The  Committee  recognizes  that  with  80  banks  having  over 
75:2082:114393:24:24:108:531:586:197:Times:197:Times:60000   branches   it   is   virtually   impossible   for   the   RBIs   inspection   
75:2083:114479:24:24:108:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:procedures  to  examine  individual  transactions  of  banks.  At  present  the  
75:2084:114560:24:24:108:532:538:197:Times:197:Times:RBI   carries   out   an   annual   financial   review(AFR)   and   a   financial   
75:2085:114644:24:25:108:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:inspection  once  in  four  years.  Even  the  financial  inspection  is  largely  
75:2086:114727:25:24:108:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:concerned  with  the  advances  portfolio  of  the  banks  and  the  adequacy  of  
75:2087:114810:24:24:108:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:provisions.  The  committee  understands  that  the  inspection  system  and  
75:2088:114888:24:24:108:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:procedures  of  the  DBOD  have  been  recently  reviewed  by  a  committee  
75:2089:114965:24:24:108:530:417:197:Times:197:Times:appointed  by  the  RBI  governor  and  its  recommendations  are  in  the  
75:2090:115041:24:24:108:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:process of being implemented. However the primary responsibility in this 
75:2091:115114:24:24:108:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:regard must remain with the bank managements which must remain with 
75:2092:115182:24:25:108:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:the bank managements which must ensure that there are adequate internal 
75:2093:115254:25:24:108:531:320:197:Times:197:Times:control  (including  internal  audit)  procedures.  The  committee  would  
75:2094:115329:24:24:108:264:296:197:Times:197:Times:,therefore recommend that: 
75:2095:115356:24:24:108:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:(a) On-site inspection by the RBI should be supplemented by reporting of 
75:2096:115428:24:24:126:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:compliance  by  banks  with  prudential  and  other  guidelines.  To  lend  
75:2097:115504:24:24:126:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:authenticity to this compliance reporting, banks should be required to 
75:2098:115575:24:24:126:529:200:197:Times:197:Times:get  compliance  in  key  areas  certified  by  statutory  auditors  of  the  
75:2099:115653:24:25:126:166:176:197:Times:197:Times:banks. 
75:2100:115660:25:24:108:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:(b) The scope of the RBI inspection should be widened to include greater 
75:2101:115732:24:24:126:319:127:197:Times:197:Times:emphasis on the treasury function 
75:2102:115766:24:24:108:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:(c) The RBI should review the adequacy of the internal audit departments 
75:2103:115838:24:0:126:387:79:197:Times:197:Times:of the banks and the scope of their operations. 
76:2104:115886:0:24:108:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:(d) The portfolio management operations of banks should be subjected to 
76:2105:115957:24:24:126:525:683:197:Times:197:Times:a separate audit by the banks’statutory auditors as these operations are 
76:2106:116030:24:25:126:338:659:197:Times:197:Times:in the nature of trusteeship functions. 
76:2107:116070:25:24:108:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:(e) The  RBI  should  strengthen  it’s  organization  responsible  fro  market  
76:2108:116149:24:24:126:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:intelligence  so  that  early  action  can  be  taken  when  there  are  market  
76:2109:116230:24:24:126:270:586:197:Times:197:Times:rumours of irregularities. 
76:2110:116257:24:24:90:323:562:197:Times:197:Times:                11)Ready Purchase Operations 
76:2111:116302:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:It  would  be  counter  productive  to  ban  REPO  transactions  as  they  serve  a  
76:2112:116387:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:useful  purpose  as  money  market  instrument  for  equilibrating  liquidity  and  
76:2113:116471:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:for  covering  the  needs  of  banks  and  bulk  investors  for  short-term  funds  at  
76:2114:116559:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:varying  points  of    time.  While  continuation  of  REPOs  even  in  PSU  bonds  
76:2115:116643:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:and  units  could  be  allowed.  It  is  important  that  the  transactions  should  be  
76:2116:116732:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:covered  by  prudential  guidelines  to  be  stipulated  by  RBI,  limiting  overall  
76:2117:116818:24:24:90:531:393:197:Times:197:Times:maximum   position   as   also   portfolio   turn   over   ratios   per   player   and   
76:2118:116907:24:24:90:530:369:197:Times:197:Times:stipulating  that  all  transactions  are  put  through  a  centralized  clearance  
76:2119:116991:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:system, which can inter alia make the necessary information available to the 
76:2120:117068:25:24:90:530:320:197:Times:197:Times:authorities.Only  banks,  mutual  funds  and  financial  institutions  may  be  
76:2121:117148:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:allowed to participate in the REPO operations .These also would necessarily 
76:2122:117224:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:be the members of the centralized clearing agency. The need of some of the 
76:2123:117299:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:PSUs who have large stocks of existing PSU bonds also has to be recognized 
76:2124:117374:24:24:90:530:224:197:Times:197:Times:and  they    should  be  allowed  to  participate  in  REPO  transactions  with  
76:2125:117455:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:banks/mutual  funds/financial  institutions  for  a  limited  period  of  say  ,two  
76:2126:117540:24:25:90:532:176:197:Times:197:Times:years.RBI   may   look   into   the   manner   in   which   banks   and   financial   
76:2127:117626:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:institutions account in their books their investments in PSU bonds and units 
76:2128:117703:24:24:90:529:127:197:Times:197:Times:and  ensure  that  these  are  valued  at  market  prices  rather  than  at  prices  
76:2129:117788:24:24:90:280:103:197:Times:197:Times:nominated in REPO transactions. 
76:2130:117820:24:0:90:258:79:197:Times:197:Times:                12)Role of Brokers 
77:2131:117855:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:As regards role of brokers the committee recommends that the firms dealing 
77:2132:117930:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:in the money market transactions should be segregated from those dealing in 
77:2133:118006:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:shares.  RBI  would  be  the  right  authority  to  regulate  such  firms  with  regard  
77:2134:118095:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:to  adequacy  of  their  capital,  extent  f  transactions  etc.  These  brokers  should  
77:2135:118185:24:24:90:513:610:197:Times:197:Times:be allowed to take positions, but they should cat as genuine intermediaries. 
77:2136:118262:24:24:90:525:586:197:Times:197:Times:                   13)Phased   Electronic   Clearance,   Settlement   and   Depository 
77:2137:118349:24:24:90:139:562:197:Times:197:Times:(ECSD) 
77:2138:118356:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:    All  the  transactions  should  be  routed  through  a  centralized  agency  which  
77:2139:118444:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:will  operate  an  electronic  book-entry  clearance  and  settlement  system  and  
77:2140:118528:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:would  also  act  as  depository  (ECSD).RBI  should  ensure  that  all  the  bulk  
77:2141:118612:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:investors (i.e. banks, mutual funds ,financial institutions and PSUs ) become 
77:2142:118690:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:members of the ECSD and all their transactions in PSU/units irrespective of 
77:2143:118766:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:whether  they  are  traded  on  stock  exchanges  or  outside  on  spot  basis  are  
77:2144:118851:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:reported  cleared  and  settled  through  ECSD.There  be  only  one  ECSD  in  
77:2145:118930:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:Bombay/New Bombay as the setting up to many smaller organizations may 
77:2146:119000:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:not be cost effective and may create problems in monitoring and control.To 
77:2147:119075:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:give a legal standing to the depository legal changes would also be required 
77:2148:119152:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:for registration of PSU bonds and units in the name of the depository .Legal 
77:2149:119229:24:24:90:525:272:197:Times:197:Times:changes will also be required for exemption of revenue stamp duty in respect 
77:2150:119306:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:of  PSU  bonds/units  whilst  registering  in  the  name  of  the  depository.ECSD  
77:2151:119390:24:24:90:529:224:197:Times:197:Times:should  be  formed  and  become  operative  straightaway  even  in  a  limited  
77:2152:119470:24:24:90:530:200:197:Times:197:Times:fashion  so  that  it  can  act  as  a  centralized  agency  fro  monitoring  the  
77:2153:119553:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:transactions  and  making  the  data  available  for  monetary  and  regulatory  
77:2154:119634:25:0:90:156:151:197:Times:197:Times:authorities.

78:2157:119741:23:25:90:431:659:197:Times:197:Times:The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows:— 
78:2158:119798:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:1. To go into the irregularities and manipulations in all their ramifications in 
78:2159:119879:24:24:90:181:610:197:Times:197:Times:all transactions, 
78:2160:119897:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:including insiders trading, relating to shares and other financial instruments 
78:2161:119976:24:24:90:134:562:197:Times:197:Times:and the 
78:2162:119984:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:role of banks, brokers and promoters, stock exchanges, financial institutions,

78:2177:120604:25:24:90:176:175:197:Times:197:Times:B1) Overview 
78:2178:120617:24:24:90:97:151:197:Times:197:Times:  
78:2179:120619:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:Parliament, through a motion in the Lok Sabha on 26.4.2001, mandated this 
78:2180:120693:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:JPC(Joint Parliamentary Committee) to enquire into the stock market scam. 
78:2181:120767:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:This scam was distinct and different from the scam enquired into by a Joint 
79:2182:120843:0:24:90:529:707:197:Times:197:Times:Parliamentary  Committee  in  1992-93.  While  the  enquiry  into  the  earlier  
79:2183:120924:24:24:90:528:683:197:Times:197:Times:scam  related  to  ‘irregularities  in  securities  and  banking  transactions’,  the  
79:2184:121011:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:present  scam  mainly  relates  to  financial  misconduct  in  the  stock  market.  
79:2185:121095:25:24:90:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:Both  the  scam  enquired  into  in  1992-93  and  the  present  one  have  some  
79:2186:121177:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:common features like the failure of some banks as also high volatility in the 
79:2187:121255:24:24:90:528:586:197:Times:197:Times:stock  market.The  Committee  were  given  an  additional  task  after  they  had  
79:2188:121338:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:been constituted and started functioning. As announced by the Speaker, Lok 
79:2189:121413:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:Sabha on 3.8.2001, the Committee were further asked to look into all matters 
79:2190:121490:24:25:90:530:514:197:Times:197:Times:relating  to  the  Unit  Trust  of  India  (UTI).  This  additional  task  to  the  
79:2191:121574:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:Committee  was  necessitated  by  the  freeze  on  resale  of  US-64  units  by  UTI  
79:2192:121660:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:in July 2001. Accordingly, the Committee enlarged their enquiry to include 
79:2193:121735:24:24:90:529:441:197:Times:197:Times:UTI  in  addition  to  the  Stock  Market  Scam.During  the  working  of  this  
79:2194:121815:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:Committee, simultaneous actions pertaining to the enquiry were initiated by 
79:2195:121891:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:the  Regulatory  agencies  like  SEBI(Securities  And  Exchange  Board  Of  
79:2196:121967:24:24:90:529:369:197:Times:197:Times:India),RBI(Reserve  Bank  Of  India)  and  DCA  (Department  Of  Company  
79:2197:122041:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:Affairs).Information was gathered by the Committee from all these agencies 
79:2198:122116:25:24:90:531:320:197:Times:197:Times:through  written  questions,  perusal  of  relevant  departmental  documents  
79:2199:122194:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:including files and depositions in person by heads/representatives of Banks, 
79:2200:122271:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:Regulatory bodies, Stock Exchanges, UTI(Unit Trust Of India) and officials 
79:2201:122346:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:of  Government  departments.  The  Committee  were  also  assisted  by  the  
79:2202:122423:24:24:90:529:224:197:Times:197:Times:present  Finance  Minister  and  his  three  immediate  predecessors.  Flowing  
79:2203:122503:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:from the terms of reference were some of the questions that were discussed 
79:2204:122578:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:in-house  by  the  JPC:  Why  do  scams  occur  frequently?  Are  the  rules  and  
79:2205:122661:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:regulations  obsolete  or  inadequate?  Do  regulatory  authorities  lack  adequate  
79:2206:122746:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:power, or, are they deficient in implementation and vigilance? Do the stock 
79:2207:122822:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:exchanges  follow  laid-down  guidelines  and  procedures?  Are  the  managem  
79:2208:122901:24:0:90:532:79:197:Times:197:Times:ents   of   banks   following   the   norms   of   accountability   and   corporate   
80:2209:122987:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:governance and are they running them according to guidelines laid down by 
80:2210:123061:24:24:90:525:683:197:Times:197:Times:the regulator? Should the stock market be self-disciplined and self-regulating 
80:2211:123140:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:or,  should  the  regulators  and  the  Government  keep  a  close  watch  all  the  
80:2212:123225:25:24:90:502:634:197:Times:197:Times:time? Have Government shown themselves alert to emerging problems?  
80:2213:123292:24:24:90:94:610:197:Times:197:Times: 
80:2214:123292:24:24:90:414:586:197:Times:197:Times:B2) The Mechanics of the Stock Market Scam of 2001 
80:2215:123343:24:24:90:94:562:197:Times:197:Times: 
80:2216:123343:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:The  period  of  the  scam,  the  main  players  involved,  and  its  intensity  have  
80:2217:123430:24:25:90:528:514:197:Times:197:Times:been  examined  by  the  Committee.  The  present  scam  includes  the  role  of  
80:2218:123512:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:banks,  stock  exchanges,  brokers,  the  Unit  Trust  of  India  (UTI),  corporate  
80:2219:123597:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:bodies and chartered accountants. Regulatory authorities like SEBI, RBI and 
80:2220:123673:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:the  Department  of  Company  Affairs  (DCA)  should  have  been  able  to  lay  
80:2221:123754:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:down  and  implement  guidelines  and  procedures  that  could  prevent  such  a  
80:2222:123836:24:24:90:530:393:197:Times:197:Times:scam  or  at  least  activate  red  alerts  that  could  lead  to  early  detection,  
80:2223:123922:24:24:90:529:369:197:Times:197:Times:investigation  and  action  against  fraud  as  well  as  the  rectification  of  any  
80:2224:124009:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:systemic  deficiencies  discovered.  Moreover,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  
80:2225:124091:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:Regulators  and  all  others  concerned  had  the  benefit  of  the  voluminous  and  
80:2226:124177:24:24:90:532:296:197:Times:197:Times:detailed   Action   Taken   Reports   (ATRs)   submitted   by   Government   to   
80:2227:124259:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:Parliament  on  the  numerous  recommendations  of  the  1993  Report  of  the  
80:2228:124339:24:24:90:529:248:197:Times:197:Times:Joint  Committee  on  irregularities  in  securities  and  banking  transactions.  
80:2229:124422:24:24:90:530:224:197:Times:197:Times:Concerted  mutual  interaction  between  Government  and  the  Regulators,  
80:2230:124498:24:24:90:531:200:197:Times:197:Times:especially   through   the   institutional   mechanism   of   HLCC,   could   have   
80:2231:124583:24:25:90:531:176:197:Times:197:Times:signally   contributed   to   effective   pre-emptive   and   corrective   action   to   
80:2232:124672:25:24:90:530:151:197:Times:197:Times:forestall  or  moderate  the  scam  by  the  early  detection  of  wrong-doing.  
80:2233:124753:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:Investigations were undertaken by SEBI against  the manipulator’s  entities 
80:2234:124829:24:24:90:529:103:197:Times:197:Times:in  the  wake  of  allegations  that  manipulator’s  entities  were  involved  in  
80:2235:124912:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:market manipulation in some scrips. The manipulator was operating through 
81:2236:124986:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:a  large  number  of  entities  which  facilitated  hiding  the  nexus  between  the  
81:2237:125072:24:24:90:531:683:197:Times:197:Times:source  of  fund  flows  to  him  from  corporate  houses,  banks,  financial  
81:2238:125151:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:institutions and foreign institutional investors and the ultimatedeployment of 
81:2239:125230:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:these  funds  in  the  stock  market.  It  was  observed  that  funds  received  by  
81:2240:125315:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:certain  entities  from  banks  as  loans  and  overdrafts  were  diverted  to  other  
81:2241:125402:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:entities for acquiring shares/meeting other obligations. It also appeared that, 
81:2242:125482:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:transactions for purchase and sale of shares were done in the name of a large 
81:2243:125560:24:24:90:531:538:197:Times:197:Times:number  of  entities  so  that  concentration  of  positions/transactions  in  a  
81:2244:125642:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:particular  scrip  could  not  be  readily  detected.  Thus,  various  layers  were  
81:2245:125727:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:created so that it became difficult to link the source of fund with the actual 
81:2246:125806:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:users to which these fund were put. He used a net working of various FII sub 
81:2247:125883:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:accounts, OCBs, institutions and mutual funds for large transactions thereby 
81:2248:125960:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:creating  an  impression  of  market  interest  in  certain  select  scrips.To  begin  
81:2249:126047:24:24:90:533:393:197:Times:197:Times:with,   he   normally   identified   companies   with   relatively   low   floating   
81:2250:126133:24:24:90:529:369:197:Times:197:Times:stocks,acquired  substantial  holdings  in  these  companies  either  directly  or  
81:2251:126217:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:through  associates  including  FII  sub  accounts,  OCBs  etc.He  also  used  the  
81:2252:126301:25:24:90:531:320:197:Times:197:Times:presence   of   a   number   of   exchanges   and   different   settlement   cyclesto   
81:2253:126389:24:24:90:530:296:197:Times:197:Times:systemically  shift  positions  from  one  Exchange  to  the  other  Exchange.  
81:2254:126469:24:24:90:529:272:197:Times:197:Times:While  being  interested  in  increasing  or  maintaining  the  prices  of  select  
81:2255:126553:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:scrips,  he  appears  at  various  point  of  time  to  have  systematically  sold/off-  
81:2256:126642:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:loaded  his  holdings  to  book  profits  and  take  further  positions  therefrom  to  
81:2257:126730:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:further  increase  the  prices..  Some  of  the  corporate  groups  which  had  given  
81:2258:126817:24:25:90:530:176:197:Times:197:Times:funds  to  the  manipulators  entities  during  January  2000-April  2001  are  
81:2259:126897:25:24:90:530:151:197:Times:197:Times:Adani,  HFCL,  DSQ,  Cadila,  Essel,Kopran  and  Nirma  and  the  amount  
81:2260:126971:24:24:90:525:127:197:Times:197:Times:outstanding from the manipulator to these entities is over Rs. 1273 crore. His 
81:2261:127050:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:entities received around Rs. 80 crore from Vidyut Investments, a subsidiary 
81:2262:127126:24:0:90:527:79:197:Times:197:Times:of  Ranbaxy.  Most  of  the  companies  have  claimed  that  the  funds  given  by  
82:2263:127210:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:them  to    the  manipulator’s  entities  were  in  the  nature  of  Inter  Corporate  
82:2264:127297:24:24:90:528:683:197:Times:197:Times:Deposits(ICDs)  under  the  Companies  Act.  They  also  claim  that  they  have  
82:2265:127379:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:given some money to buy the shares of other companies but not their own.

83:2312:131131:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:Software, Global Tele, etc. and whether these companies provided him large 
83:2313:131206:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:funds  to  jack  up  their  prices.  In  reply,  the  witness  conceded  that  they  had  
83:2314:131296:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:large investments in these companies and said ‘We did build huge positions 
83:2315:131371:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:in  the  market  in  these  companies,  and  probably  because  of  that  I  suffered  
83:2316:131458:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:that losses that I suffered.’ He further said that , ‘none of the corporates has 
84:2317:131539:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:ever given us money to invest in their own shares or to buy their own shares. 
84:2318:131617:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:The  moneys  received  from  the  corporates  were  for  specific  contracts  -  for  
84:2319:131703:24:25:90:529:659:197:Times:197:Times:purchase  of  shares  in  the  companies  that  they  were  interested  in,  either

84:2321:131869:24:24:90:529:610:197:Times:197:Times:contracts  were  completed  in  time,  part  of  the  contracts  are  still  pending  
84:2322:131955:24:24:90:530:586:197:Times:197:Times:because  I  got  into  problems.  The  moneys  that  have  come  from  these  
84:2323:132033:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:corporates  have  come  when  the  markets  have,  in  fact,  started  going  down  
84:2324:132117:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:drastically and when the valuations thought by them were right for investing 
84:2325:132194:24:25:90:527:514:197:Times:197:Times:in the companies they wanted. In the whole rise of 1999-2000, not a single 
84:2326:132269:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:corporate has ever given us any money to invest in the shares. Even during 
84:2327:132344:24:24:90:527:465:197:Times:197:Times:the  down  side  also,  there  was  no  money  fromany  corporate  given  to  us  to  
84:2328:132430:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:buy their own shares or for jacking up the price. Referring to SEBI reports, 
84:2329:132507:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:the Committee pointed out that funds were available to the manipulator from 
84:2330:132583:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:HFCL Group, Zee group, Madhavpura Bank and OCBs, the witness said that 
84:2331:132654:24:24:90:525:369:197:Times:197:Times:‘all these monies have come in from the period of September, 2000 to March 
84:2332:132729:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:2001’ after the fall started. According to the manipulator, the biggest rise in 
84:2333:132809:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:the market was during the period 1999-2000 and that his borrowings during 
84:2334:132883:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:that period was in the region of Rs. 50 crore to 100 crore. On the other hand

84:2338:133216:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:manipulators  entities  suffered  loss  in  range  of  Rs.  3000  crores  to  Rs.  4000

85:2373:134338:24:25:90:526:297:197:Times:197:Times:dimensions of the stock market scam which surfaced in March 2001, as also 
85:2374:134412:25:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:in payments problem in the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) and the crash of 
85:2375:134486:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:Madhavpura  Mercantile  Cooperative  Bank  (MMCB).  He  was  operating  
85:2376:134558:24:24:90:530:224:197:Times:197:Times:through  a  large  number  of  entities  which  facilitated  hiding  the  nexus  
85:2377:134639:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:between  source  of  funds  flow  and  their  ultimate  use.  Various  layers  were  
85:2378:134724:24:24:90:527:176:197:Times:197:Times:created  in  his  transactions  so  that  it  became  difficult  to  link  the  source  of  
85:2379:134816:24:24:90:525:152:197:Times:197:Times:fund with the actual user of fund. SEBI’s investigations after the scam have 
85:2380:134893:24:24:90:530:128:197:Times:197:Times:revealed  that  the  amount  outstanding  from  the  manipulators  entities  to  
85:2381:134974:24:25:90:526:104:197:Times:197:Times:certain corporate houses at the end of April, 2001 was over Rs. 1,273 crore. 
85:2382:135051:25:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:Dues of the manipulators entities to MMCB were around Rs. 888 crore and 
86:2383:135123:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:to  Global  Trust  Bank  over  Rs.  266  crore.  There  were  also  dues  to  other  
86:2384:135208:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:entities.  The  funds  received  from  corporate  houses  and  banks  have  gone  to  
86:2385:135294:24:25:90:530:659:197:Times:197:Times:three  major  broker  groups  in  CSE  and  been  utilized  in  capital  market  
86:2386:135375:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:operations. The manipulators entities appear to have chosen CSE mainly to 
86:2387:135449:24:24:90:532:610:197:Times:197:Times:exploit   the   known   weaknesses   of   the   EXchange.   They   also   used   a   
86:2388:135534:24:24:90:530:586:197:Times:197:Times:networking  of  various  Overseas  Corporate  Bodies,  Foreign  Institutional  
86:2389:135613:24:24:90:527:562:197:Times:197:Times:Investor  sub-accounts  and  mutual  funds  for  large  transactions.  Not  till  the  
86:2390:135700:24:24:90:527:538:197:Times:197:Times:MMCB  crash  occurred  did  the  regulatory  authorities  even  begin  looking  in  
86:2391:135784:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:the manipulators directions although this was being underlined in Parliament 
86:2392:135861:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:and  the  media.  It  is  difficult  to  believe  that  the  Stock  Exchanges  or  SEBI  
86:2393:135950:24:24:90:531:465:197:Times:197:Times:were   quite   unaware   of   what   was   going   on   in   the   market   when   the   
86:2394:136039:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:manipulators entities were manipulating the market using their network. Nor 
86:2395:136115:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:did  the  High  Level  Coordination  Committee  (HLCC)  or  the  SEBI  seek  a  
86:2396:136195:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:check  on  where  the  mnaipulator  was  getting  his  funds  from  or  his  methods  
86:2397:136281:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:of manipulating the market. This is all the more disturbing in the context of 
86:2398:136359:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:the  previous  JPC’s  findings  against  the  manipulator.  The  main  regulator  of  
86:2399:136445:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:Stock Exchanges, SEBI, has been in place since 1988 and has been working 
86:2400:136518:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:under an Act of Parliament since 1992 and should have been able to regulate 
86:2401:136594:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:the liberalized market more efficiently. The Committee found that SEBI has 
86:2402:136669:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:still  a  long  way  to  go  before  becoming  a  mature  and  effective  regulator.  If  
86:2403:136759:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:SEBI  had  continued  to  improve  its  procedures,  vigilance,  enforcement  and  
86:2404:136842:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:control mechanisms, it could have been more effective in a situation where 
86:2405:136917:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:the  stock  market  became  unusually  volatile,  leading  to  an  unprecedented  
86:2406:136999:25:24:90:526:151:197:Times:197:Times:surge and subsequent depression in the capital markets. It was also clear that 
86:2407:137078:24:24:90:529:127:197:Times:197:Times:the  capitalmarket  in  India  is  neither  deep  nor  wide  enough  to  moderate  
86:2408:137161:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:volatility and, therefore, a fewplayers could attempt to manipulate the stock 
86:2409:137239:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:markets. Clearly, the various regulatory authorities were not able to foresee 
87:2410:137317:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:the situation leading to the scam and prevent it. “Nor was adequate attention 
87:2411:137395:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:paid  in  government  circles  particularly  the  Ministry  of  Finance  as  the  
87:2412:137477:24:25:90:526:659:197:Times:197:Times:custodian of the financial health of the economy.Wrong doing by banks have 
87:2413:137552:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:also  contributed  significantly  towards  the  scam  although  the  number  of  
87:2414:137633:24:24:90:530:610:197:Times:197:Times:banks  involved  in  committing  irregularities  in  comparison  to  the  total  
87:2415:137714:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:number  of  banks  functioning  in  our  country  is  small.  Notably,  major  banks  
87:2416:137800:24:24:90:529:562:197:Times:197:Times:were  nationalized  in  1969  but  pursuant  to  economic  liberalization,  new  
87:2417:137881:24:24:90:529:538:197:Times:197:Times:private  banks  including  foreign  banks  were  allowed  into  banking  sector.  
87:2418:137963:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:Public sector banks were in general not involved in the scam and have fared 
87:2419:138039:25:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:well  but  private  sector  banks  need  to  be  closely  watched,  especially  in  the  
87:2420:138128:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:area  of  risk  management  and  stricter  regulation.  Cooperative  banks  have  
87:2421:138210:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:tended to ignore rules, procedures and risk management. This should set the 
87:2422:138286:24:24:90:528:417:197:Times:197:Times:RBI  and  the  Government  thinking.  There  is  need  to  have  more  effective  
87:2423:138368:24:24:90:529:393:197:Times:197:Times:regulation  in  the  banking  sector  as  a  whole  with  particular  emphasis  on  
87:2424:138452:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:cooperative banks.One of the major concerns of the Committee was to look 
87:2425:138525:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:at  the  trading  practices  and  procedures  adopted  in  the  stock  market.  Stock  
87:2426:138612:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:Exchanges, brokers and regulators play a very important role in determining 
87:2427:138688:24:24:90:529:296:197:Times:197:Times:the  transparency  of  procedures  and  practices  in  the  stock  markets.  The  
87:2428:138770:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:Committee  went  into  the  functioning  of  these  entities  and  generally  found  
87:2429:138855:24:24:90:530:248:197:Times:197:Times:that  the  quality  of  governance  and  the  practices  followed  in  the  stock  
87:2430:138938:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:exchanges  were  different  from  exchange  to  exchange,  having  evolved  from  
87:2431:139020:24:24:90:531:200:197:Times:197:Times:different   local   economic,   social   and   historical   conditions.   SEBI,   as   a   
87:2432:139111:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:regulator,  had  made  some  attempts  at  standardizing  the  practices  in  these  
87:2433:139196:25:24:90:528:151:197:Times:197:Times:exchanges  and  had  also  instituted  arrangements  whereby  the  happening  in  
87:2434:139278:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:the  stock  exchanges  would  come  to  its  notice.  But,  in  practice,  the  system  
87:2435:139366:24:24:90:526:103:197:Times:197:Times:did not function efficiently or in a transparent manner. When stock markets 
87:2436:139442:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:were rising, there was general lack of concern to see that such a rise should 
88:2437:139520:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:be in consonance with the integrity of the market and not the consequence of 
88:2438:139597:24:24:90:528:683:197:Times:197:Times:manipulation  or  other  malpractice.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  markets  
88:2439:139679:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:went  into  a  steep  fall,  there  was  concern  all  over.  Such  dissonance  in  the  
88:2440:139768:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:approach  to  issues  of  regulation  and  good  governance  needs  to  be  replaced  
88:2441:139854:24:24:90:525:610:197:Times:197:Times:with effective regulation which concentrates on market integrity and investor 
88:2442:139932:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:protection whether at any given point of time the market is buoyant or not. 
88:2443:140008:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:This  Committee  did  not  concern  itself  with  either  the  rise  or  fall  of  the  
88:2444:140096:24:24:90:530:538:197:Times:197:Times:market  but  specifically  with  manipulations  or  irregularities  that  caused  
88:2445:140178:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:unusual rise and fall. The procedures, adherence to rules and the concern for 
88:2446:140256:25:24:90:526:489:197:Times:197:Times:common investor appear to have been quite loose in the CSE. The payment 
88:2447:140328:24:24:90:526:465:197:Times:197:Times:problem that surfaced in Calcutta Stock Exchange brought to light many ills 
88:2448:140404:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:of the institution. Worse, those ills such as unofficial badla could have been 
88:2449:140483:24:24:90:527:417:197:Times:197:Times:recognized and corrected well in time. The Committee discussed the period 
88:2450:140557:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:in which the present Scam surfaced, resulting ultimately in the crash of the 
88:2451:140634:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:stock market in March 2001 onwards. During the year 1999 and early 2000, 
88:2452:140707:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:the market, particularly ICE stocks, rose sharply. Thereafter, from June 2000 
88:2453:140785:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:onwards it showed a decline which was gradual but consistent. From March 
88:2454:140858:24:24:90:526:296:197:Times:197:Times:2001 onwards the decline in the SENSEX was sharp and could be termed a 
88:2455:140929:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:crash.  There  are  a  number  of  factors  that  contributed  to  this  crash,  one  of  
88:2456:141019:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:which  is  over-reaching  by  one  particular  broker  and  his  inability  to  sustain  
88:2457:141108:24:24:90:528:224:197:Times:197:Times:his  position.  In  addition,  during  the  month  of  January-February  2001  the  
88:2458:141192:24:24:90:526:200:197:Times:197:Times:Committee have found indications of large funds being withdrawn from the 
88:2459:141265:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:stock market. Whether withdrawal of large sums from the stock market was 
88:2460:141338:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:responsible  for  the  crash  or  the  large  players  withdrew  the  money  because  
88:2461:141424:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:they knew that the SENSEX was likely to take a beating was another aspect 
88:2462:141498:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:the  Committee  deliberated  upon. The  Committee  note  that  the  manipulator  
88:2463:141578:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:who  emerged  as  a  key  player  in  this  scam  received  large  sums  of  money  
89:2464:141662:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:from the banks as well as from the Corporate bodies during the period when 
89:2465:141737:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:SENSEX  was  falling  rapidly.  This  led  the  Committee  to  believe  that  there  
89:2466:141822:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:was a nexus between the manipulator, banks and the corporate houses. The 
89:2467:141895:25:24:90:528:634:197:Times:197:Times:Committee  recommend  that  this  nexus  be  further  investigated  by  SEBI  or  
89:2468:141977:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:Dept. of Company Affairs expeditiously. The process of liberalization of the 
89:2469:142054:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:economy  has  continued  apace  and  it  is  market  forces  that  will  increasingly  
89:2470:142141:24:24:90:526:562:197:Times:197:Times:determine economic trends in the country. With liberalization, the role of the 
89:2471:142220:24:24:90:528:538:197:Times:197:Times:Government  as  a  direct  player  in  the  financial  market  will  diminish.  This  
89:2472:142306:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:makes it all the more necessary that the procedures and guidelines laid down 
89:2473:142383:25:24:90:528:489:197:Times:197:Times:for  the  creation  and  perpetuation  of  fair  and  transparent  financial  markets  
89:2474:142470:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:and  institutions  like  stock  exchanges  and  banks  have  to  be  more  specific,  
89:2475:142556:24:24:90:528:441:197:Times:197:Times:and  effective  mechanisms  have  to  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  they  are  
89:2476:142643:24:24:90:531:417:197:Times:197:Times:regularly  followed.  That  job  will  have  to  be  done  by  the  regulatory  
89:2477:142723:24:24:90:526:393:197:Times:197:Times:authorities;  viz.,  SEBI,  RBI  and  DCA  in  liaison  with  investigative  agencies  
89:2478:142810:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:like  the  Income  Tax  Department,  Enforcement  Directorate  and  the  Central  
89:2479:142892:24:25:90:529:345:197:Times:197:Times:Bureau  of  Investigation.  Coordination  with  Government  on  policy  issues  
89:2480:142972:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:will, however, continue to be central to good governance as there can be no 
89:2481:143048:24:24:90:531:296:197:Times:197:Times:escaping   Government’s   responsibility   to   Parliament   and   the   country.   
89:2482:143132:24:24:90:527:272:197:Times:197:Times:Therefore,  Government  must  recognize  that  transactions  in  the  market  will  
89:2483:143216:24:24:90:527:248:197:Times:197:Times:be  insulated  from  scams  only  if  the  relinquishment  of  Government  control  
89:2484:143300:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:over the economy is accompanied by strong and effective regulatory bodies. 
89:2485:143375:24:24:90:528:200:197:Times:197:Times:This  point  had  also  been  underlined  by  the  earlier  JPC  Report,  1993  on  
89:2486:143459:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:Irregularities in Securities and Banking Transactions.The proceedings before 
89:2487:143536:25:24:90:529:151:197:Times:197:Times:the  Committee  themselves  acted  as  a  catalyst  for  many  reforms  in  the  
89:2488:143617:24:24:90:527:127:197:Times:197:Times:system,  which  were  put  in  place  during  the  Committee’s  pendancy.  These  
89:2489:143699:24:24:90:525:103:197:Times:197:Times:actions by regulators like SEBI and RBI and by the Ministry of Finance have 
89:2490:143775:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:been  touched  upon  in  various  chapters.  The  Committee  feel  that  after  the  
90:2491:143860:0:24:90:529:707:197:Times:197:Times:presentation  to  Parliament  in  August  and  December  1994  of  the  Action  
90:2492:143940:24:24:90:526:683:197:Times:197:Times:Taken Reports (ATRs) on the scam relating to irregularities in securities and 
90:2493:144018:24:25:90:530:659:197:Times:197:Times:banking  transactions,  the  will  to  implement  various  suggestions  of  the  
90:2494:144099:25:24:90:527:634:197:Times:197:Times:previous  Committee  petered  out.  But,  as  soon  as  this  Committee  began  its  
90:2495:144184:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:sittings and searching questions were asked, SEBI,RBI and other regulatory 
90:2496:144259:24:24:90:527:586:197:Times:197:Times:authorities  including  Ministry  of  Finance,  went  into  active  mode.  Had  this  
90:2497:144345:24:24:90:525:562:197:Times:197:Times:state of affairs prevailed after the Action Taken Report, the probability of the 
90:2498:144426:24:25:90:330:538:197:Times:197:Times:present Scam would have been negligible. 
90:2499:144467:25:24:90:94:513:197:Times:197:Times: 
90:2500:144467:24:24:90:527:489:197:Times:197:Times:B3)  Reasons  for  the  Reoccurrence  of  Security  Scam  in  2001  Inspite  of  
90:2501:144548:24:24:90:293:465:197:Times:197:Times:Guidelines Issued by RBI in 1992 
90:2502:144581:24:24:90:94:441:197:Times:197:Times: 
90:2503:144581:24:24:90:529:417:197:Times:197:Times:The  Committee  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  a  report  on  the  lines  of  the  
90:2504:144667:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:Janakiraman  Committee  Report  which  was  made  available  to  the  previous  
90:2505:144747:24:24:90:528:369:197:Times:197:Times:JPC  on  the  scam  in  securities  and  banking  transactions.  Reliable  evidence  
90:2506:144832:24:25:90:526:345:197:Times:197:Times:was difficult to find and took much time to cull. The Committee had to rely 
90:2507:144908:25:24:90:528:320:197:Times:197:Times:on  a  number  of  reports  that  dealt  with  specific  and  limited  subjects.  The  
90:2508:144995:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:enquiry reports of the regulators also displayed many gaps which had to be 
90:2509:145070:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:filled by securing answers to a very large number of questions asked by the 
90:2510:145146:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:Committee. The Special Cell constituted by the Ministry of Finance in June, 
90:2511:145222:24:24:90:529:224:197:Times:197:Times:1994  to  investigate  the  nexus  between  brokers  and  industrial  houses  in  
90:2512:145304:24:24:90:529:200:197:Times:197:Times:pursuance  of  the  recommendation  of  the  earlierJPC  having  gone  defunct  
90:2513:145384:24:25:90:529:176:197:Times:197:Times:since  May  22,  1995,  without  coming  out  with  any  tangible  findings  or  
90:2514:145465:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:recommendations  for  remedial  action,  is  one  of  the  examples  of  apathy  on  
90:2515:145550:24:24:90:528:127:197:Times:197:Times:the  part  of  different  agencies  and  departments  concerned.  The  Committee  
90:2516:145632:24:24:90:527:103:197:Times:197:Times:were  informed  by  the  Central  Board  of  Direct  Taxes  that  on  May  19,  1995  
90:2517:145718:24:0:90:526:79:197:Times:197:Times:the DGIT (Investigation), Bombay, who headed the Special Cell, had sought 
91:2518:145792:0:24:90:526:707:197:Times:197:Times:from CBDT adequate empowerment and administrative support for the Cell 
91:2519:145863:24:24:90:530:683:197:Times:197:Times:in  the  absence  of  which  the  Cell  was  unlikely  to  reach  to  any  firm  
91:2520:145944:24:25:90:531:659:197:Times:197:Times:conclusions   about   the   role   of   any   one   or   more   industrial   houses   in   
91:2521:146035:25:24:90:526:634:197:Times:197:Times:comprehensive manner but the Chairman, CBDT, in his response thereto had 
91:2522:146108:24:24:90:526:610:197:Times:197:Times:suggested that due to limited scope of task of the Special Cell no additional 
91:2523:146186:24:24:90:529:586:197:Times:197:Times:manpower  was  required.  Also  in  the  minutes  of  the  last  meeting  of  the  
91:2524:146269:24:24:90:528:562:197:Times:197:Times:Special  Cell  held  on  May  22,  1995,  the  members  recorded  that  principal  
91:2525:146352:24:24:90:526:538:197:Times:197:Times:obstacle in unearthing the exact role of the industrial houses in the scam was 
91:2526:146431:24:25:90:526:514:197:Times:197:Times:due to the scope of the Cell was limited only to Bombay region due to which 
91:2527:146507:25:24:90:529:489:197:Times:197:Times:investigation  into  the  activities  of  the  suspects  outside  Bombay  was  not  
91:2528:146591:24:24:90:530:465:197:Times:197:Times:within  the  jurisdictional  authority.  Thus,  the  Special  Cell  was  virtually  
91:2529:146675:24:24:90:526:441:197:Times:197:Times:rendered a still-born baby. The lack of concern of Government demonstrated 
91:2530:146750:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:in this casual approach to such an important issue is regrettable. This Scam 
91:2531:146826:24:24:90:531:393:197:Times:197:Times:is   basically   the   manipulation   of   the   capital   market   to   benefit   market   
91:2532:146918:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:operators, brokers, corporate entities and their promoters and managements. 
91:2533:146994:24:25:90:529:345:197:Times:197:Times:Certain  banks,  notably  private  and  co-operative  banks,  stock  exchanges,  
91:2534:147075:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:overseas  corporate  bodies  and  financial  institutions  were  willing  facilitators  
91:2535:147163:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:in  this  exercise.  The  scam  lies  not  in  the  rise  and  fall  of  prices  in  the  stock  
91:2536:147260:24:24:90:531:272:197:Times:197:Times:market,   but   in   large   scale   manipulations   like   the   diversion   of   funds,   
91:2537:147352:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:fraudulent  use  of  banks  funds,  use  of  public  funds  by  institutions  like  the  
91:2538:147441:24:24:90:527:224:197:Times:197:Times:Unit  Trust  of  India  (UTI),  violation  of  risk  norms  on  the  stock  exchanges  
91:2539:147528:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:and  banks,  and  use  of  funds  coming  through  overseas  corporate  bodies  to  
91:2540:147612:24:25:90:528:176:197:Times:197:Times:transfer  stock  holdings  and  stock  market  profits  out  of  the  country.  These  
91:2541:147699:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:activities  went  largely  unnoticed.  While  the  stock  market  was  rising,  there  
91:2542:147786:24:24:90:526:127:197:Times:197:Times:was inadequate attempt to ensure that this was not due to manipulations and 
91:2543:147862:24:24:90:529:103:197:Times:197:Times:malpractices.  In  contrast,  during  the  precipitous  fall  in  March  2001  the  
91:2544:147946:24:0:90:527:79:197:Times:197:Times:regulators  showed  greater  concern.  Another  aspect  of  concern  has  been  the  
92:2545:148031:0:24:90:527:707:197:Times:197:Times:emergence  of  a  practice  of  non-accountability  in  our  financial  system.  The  
92:2546:148117:24:24:90:531:683:197:Times:197:Times:effectiveness   of   regulations   and   their   implementation,   the   role   of   the   
92:2547:148208:24:25:90:528:659:197:Times:197:Times:regulatory  bodies  and  the  continuing  decline  in  the  banking  systems  have  
92:2548:148292:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:been  critically  examined,  for  which  the  regulators,  financial  institutions,  
92:2549:148377:24:24:90:528:610:197:Times:197:Times:banks,  Registrars  of  Co-operative  Societies,  perhaps  corporate  entities  and  
92:2550:148462:24:24:90:526:586:197:Times:197:Times:their promoters and managements, brokers, auditors and stock exchanges are 
92:2551:148537:24:24:90:536:562:197:Times:197:Times:responsible    in    varying    degrees.    The    parameters    of    governmental    
92:2552:148624:24:24:90:365:538:197:Times:197:Times:responsibility have also been taken into account. 
92:2553:148674:24:25:90:529:514:197:Times:197:Times:It  is  the  considered  view  of  the  Committee  that  the  lack  of  progress  in  
92:2554:148760:25:24:90:534:489:197:Times:197:Times:implementing   the   recommendations   of   the   last   Joint   Parliamentary   
92:2555:148841:24:24:90:528:465:197:Times:197:Times:Committee  set  up  in  1992  to  enquire  into  Irregularities  in  Securities  and  
92:2556:148927:24:24:90:527:441:197:Times:197:Times:Banking  Transactions  emboldened  wrong-doers  and  unscrupulous  elements  
92:2557:149004:24:24:90:529:417:197:Times:197:Times:to  indulge  in  financial  misconduct.  The  Special  Cell  constituted  by  the  
92:2558:149087:24:24:90:527:393:197:Times:197:Times:Ministry  of  Finance  in  June  1994  to  investigate  the  nexus  between  brokers  
92:2559:149173:24:24:90:527:369:197:Times:197:Times:and  industrial  houses  in  pursuance  of  the  recommendation  of  the  previous  
92:2560:149257:24:25:90:528:345:197:Times:197:Times:Committee  having  gone  defunct  since  22  May  1995,  without  coming  out  
92:2561:149336:25:24:90:526:320:197:Times:197:Times:with anytangible findings or recommendations for remedial action, is one of 
92:2562:149412:24:24:90:528:296:197:Times:197:Times:the  examples  of  apathy  on  the  part  of  different  agencies  and  departments  
92:2563:149497:24:24:90:526:272:197:Times:197:Times:concerned. The Committee express their concern at the way the supervisory 
92:2564:149571:24:24:90:528:248:197:Times:197:Times:authorities  have  been  performing  their  role  and  the  regulators  have  been  
92:2565:149655:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:exercising their regulatory responsibilities. That the regulatory bodies failed 
92:2566:149735:24:24:90:527:200:197:Times:197:Times:in  exercising  prudent  supervision  on  the  activities  of  the  stock  market  and  
92:2567:149823:24:25:90:526:176:197:Times:197:Times:banking transactions, became evident during the course of evidence taken by 
92:2568:149899:25:24:90:527:151:197:Times:197:Times:the Committee and this has been detailed in the succeeding chapters. In the 
92:2569:149975:24:24:90:531:127:197:Times:197:Times:Committee’s   view   no   financial   system   can   work   efficiently   even   if   
92:2570:150061:24:24:90:530:103:197:Times:197:Times:innumerable  regulations  are  put  in  place,  unless  there  is  a  system  of  
92:2571:150143:24:0:90:528:79:197:Times:197:Times:accountability,  cohesion  and  close  cooperation  in  the  working  of  different  
93:2572:150228:0:24:90:528:707:197:Times:197:Times:agencies  of  the  government  and  the  regulators.  In  August  2001,  after  the  
93:2573:150313:24:24:90:527:683:197:Times:197:Times:freeze  by  UTI  in  US-64  unit  repurchases,  the  Committee  were  additionally  
93:2574:150397:24:25:90:527:659:197:Times:197:Times:mandated  by  Parliament  to  enquire  into  UTI  matters.  The  Committee  find  
93:2575:150479:25:24:90:529:634:197:Times:197:Times:that  weaknesses  in  management  and  regulations  of  stock  exchanges  was  
93:2576:150558:24:24:90:527:610:197:Times:197:Times:compounded  by  serious  management  deficiencies  in  the  UTI  and  financial  
93:2577:150639:24:24:90:159:586:197:Times:197:Times:institutions.

93:2580:150729:24:24:90:526:513:197:Times:197:Times:Reoccurrence of a Security Scam in India and Corporate Governance in 
93:2581:150798:24:24:90:163:489:197:Times:197:Times:this regard.

93:2583:150811:24:24:90:529:441:197:Times:197:Times:"New  brains  are  out  to  circumvent  rules  in  the  system.  Politicians  and  
93:2584:150894:24:24:90:526:417:197:Times:197:Times:politics have  a major role to play. They is a pressure in PSUs to hire every 
93:2585:150972:24:24:90:528:393:197:Times:197:Times:X,  Y  and  Z  and  hence  overstaffing  and  inefficiency.  They  have  become  
93:2586:151053:24:24:90:526:369:197:Times:197:Times:more commercial in operations. These workers are also inefficient and have 
93:2587:151128:24:25:90:527:345:197:Times:197:Times:no  incentive  to  work  hard.  As  much  as  how  good  work  is  not  rewarded  so  
93:2588:151214:25:24:90:527:320:197:Times:197:Times:are  mistakes  not  found  out  and  corrected.  While  people  in  major  banks  are  
93:2589:151301:24:24:90:527:296:197:Times:197:Times:paid  less  they  have  no  initiative  to  work  hard.  In  order  to  prevent  another  
93:2590:151391:24:24:90:528:272:197:Times:197:Times:scam  from  happening  a  more  comprehensive  set  of  guidelines  have  to  be  
93:2591:151473:24:24:90:526:248:197:Times:197:Times:prepared. Master Circulars have to be made available to bankers so that they 
93:2592:151550:24:24:90:526:224:197:Times:197:Times:work honestly and efficiently. In India justice is so much delayed and people 
93:2593:151628:24:24:90:398:200:197:Times:197:Times:often fall into old ways without following guidelines."
