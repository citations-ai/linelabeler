2:9:256:0:27:85:462:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:Orphan versus non-orphan IPOs: The difference analyst coverage makes 
2:10:325:27:14:259:339:718:144:Times:144:Times:A:Romain Boissin 
2:11:340:14:38:85:88:704:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
2:12:340:38:27:120:516:666:144:Times:144:Times:A:Numerous  articles  in  academic  journals  or  in  the  press  have  highlighted  the  
2:13:428:27:28:85:513:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance of financial analysts’ coverage of firms that are going public. Newly public 
2:14:516:28:27:85:516:611:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms  rely  on  their  underwriters  throughout  the  IPO  process,  especially  during  the  
2:15:611:27:28:85:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:marketing phase. The underwriters’ services include determining the offering price and 
2:16:698:28:28:85:513:556:144:Times:144:Times:B:the distribution of shares, but what is of particular importance for the issuer is receiving 
2:17:791:28:27:85:516:528:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage  through  their  financial  analysts.  During  the  IPO,  investors  are  limited  to  
2:18:887:27:28:85:512:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:information contained in the prospectus. As a result, the flow of information is restricted 
2:19:979:28:27:85:515:473:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  sparse.  Financial  analysts  can  reduce  these  asymmetries.  Indeed,  coverage  can  
2:20:1072:27:28:85:515:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:transcend  borders  and  financial  markets  and  put  the  firm  in  the  spotlight.  Coverage  is  
2:21:1173:28:28:85:514:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:seen  to  add  value  by  the  firm  because  it  can  generate  publicity,  attract  new  consumers  
2:22:1275:28:27:85:514:390:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Cliff and Denis, 2004), boost the share price (Chen and Ritter,  2000;  Aggarwal  et  al.,  
2:23:1368:27:28:85:514:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002),  attract  new  investors,  and  reduce  the  cost  of  capital.  However,  coverage  is  not  
2:24:1469:28:27:85:514:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:uniformly  distributed  and  is  mainly  concentrated  on  large  firms  (as  measured  by  their  
2:25:1568:27:28:85:515:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:market  capitalization).  In  the  mid-2000s,  50  per  cent  of  IPO  firms  were  covered  by  a  
2:26:1668:28:28:85:515:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial  analyst  and  35  per  cent  had  no  coverage1.  Newly  public  firms  often  suffer  
2:27:1766:28:27:85:514:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:from lack of analyst coverage even though it is widely accepted that, because coverage 
2:28:1853:27:28:85:503:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:adds value, the allocation of resources to attract such coverage is a worthy investment. 
2:29:1942:28:27:120:516:197:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  paper  addresses  the  resources  at  the  disposal  of  IPO  firms  to  attract  
2:30:2030:27:28:85:515:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial  analysts.  We  examine  the  long-run  performance  of  orphan  and  non-orphan  
2:31:2122:28:28:85:513:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPOs to explain what value has to be attributed to analyst coverage. We are interested in 
2:32:2212:28:0:85:513:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  added  value  of  analyst  coverage,  making  relevant distinctions between orphan IPO 
3:33:2306:0:27:85:513:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms (those without analyst coverage within 5 years of their issuance) and non-orphan 
3:34:2393:27:28:85:515:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPO  firms  (those  with  analyst  coverage  within  5  years  of  their  issuance).  This  paper  
3:35:2492:28:27:85:513:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:addresses the question of the importance of analyst coverage for the long-run returns of 
3:36:2581:27:28:85:307:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPO firms over the period from 1991 to 2010. 
3:37:2626:28:28:120:513:635:144:Times:144:Times:A:Over the years, academic research has noted the importance of analyst coverage. 
3:38:2706:28:27:85:514:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:Krigman et al. (2001) suggested that the most important motivation for firms to switch 
3:39:2793:27:28:85:515:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:underwriters  between  their  IPO  and  a  Seasoned  Equity  Offering  (SEO)  is  to  obtain  
3:40:2887:28:27:85:515:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:additional  and  influential  analyst  coverage.  Loughran  and  Ritter  (2004)  and  Cliff  and  
3:41:2985:27:28:85:514:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:Denis (2004) argued that the underpricing of newly public firms is positively related to 
3:42:3074:28:28:85:513:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyst coverage. According to Loughran and Ritter (2004), the average underpricing of 
3:43:3161:28:27:85:514:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPOs  was  7  per  cent  in  the  1980s,  which  doubled  to  15  per  cent  from  1990  to  1998,  
3:44:3261:27:28:85:514:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:before  jumping  to  65  per  cent  during  the  internet  bubble.  Part  of  this  increase  can  be  
3:45:3364:28:27:85:513:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributed to analyst coverage, which has grown more important over the years. Bradley 
3:46:3451:27:28:85:513:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:et al. (2003) showed that the number of managing underwriters in a syndicate is a good 
3:47:3538:28:28:85:516:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator  of  the  coverage  enjoyed  by  newly  listed  firms  at  the  time  of  their  IPOs.  
3:48:3636:28:27:85:514:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:Corwin and Schultz (2005) examined the syndicates  of  1638  IPOs  and  found  evidence  
3:49:3725:27:28:85:517:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  each  additional  co-manager  results  in  0.8  additional  analyst  recommendations  
3:50:3817:28:27:85:514:276:144:Times:144:Times:B:within  3  months  of  the  IPO.  Bradley  et  al.  (2008b),  however,  did  not  find  incremental  
3:51:3918:27:28:85:513:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage to be related to improved long-run performance. Bradley et al. (2004) focused 
3:52:4005:28:28:85:513:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the 2-year post-issue performance (at the end of the IPO’s quiet period) of IPOs that 
3:53:4094:28:27:85:513:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:receive analyst coverage compared to those that do not. The authors found that orphans 
3:54:4181:27:28:85:514:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly underperformed compared to non-orphans during the period from 1996 to 
3:55:4265:28:0:85:115:138:144:Times:144:Times:B:1998. 
4:56:4273:0:27:120:513:745:144:Times:144:Times:A:Unlike Bradley et al. (2004), we analyse long-run performance from one to five 
4:57:4352:27:28:85:515:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:years  after  the  IPO.  We  measure  the  influence  of  analyst  coverage  on  the  long-run  
4:58:4448:28:27:85:514:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance  of  IPO  firms  over  a  five-year  horizon.  We  are  then  able  to  observe  how  
4:59:4546:27:28:85:514:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:long-run  performance  adjusts  to  analyst  coverage.  Our  observation  period  is  large  and  
4:60:4644:28:28:85:512:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:encompasses the period from 1991 to 2010. Our definition of an orphan IPO firm differs 
4:61:4731:28:27:85:514:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:from  that  of  Bradley  et  al.  (2004)  because  the  authors  consider  an  IPO  firm  to  be  an  
4:62:4833:27:28:85:513:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:orphan if “there is an absence of a research report/analyst recommendation at the end of 
4:63:4922:28:27:85:431:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:the quiet period by at least one underwriter in the managing syndicate”. 
4:64:4995:27:28:120:513:525:144:Times:144:Times:A:In US IPOs, during the one- to five-year horizon, we find a significant long-run 
4:65:5076:28:28:85:510:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:abnormal  performance  by  orphans  (IPOs  without  analyst  coverage)  compared  to  non-
4:66:5166:28:27:85:510:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:orphans (IPOs with analyst coverage). For instance, by the fifth year after the IPO, buy-
4:67:5255:27:28:85:510:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:and-hold abnormal returns for orphans were a significant -52.95 per cent compared to -
4:68:5341:28:27:85:514:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:8.07  per  cent  for  non-orphans,  a  difference  that  is  statistically  significant  at  the  1  per  
4:69:5447:27:28:85:513:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent level. Further analysis reveals that this outperformance by non-orphans stems from 
4:70:5535:28:28:85:517:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:high  analyst  coverage.  Our  results  are  robust  after  accounting  for  venture  capital  
4:71:5630:28:27:85:517:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:backing,  underwriting  syndicates,  underpricing,  institutional  investor  ownership,  or  
4:72:5723:27:28:85:246:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:operating performance variables. 
4:73:5756:28:27:120:514:276:144:Times:144:Times:A:The paper is organised as follows. We first discuss the existing literature. In the 
4:74:5840:27:28:85:515:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:second  section,  we  describe  the  methodology,  data  and  sample  statistics.  The  third  
4:75:5935:28:28:85:423:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:section presents the findings, and the last section concludes the paper. 
4:76:6008:28:27:85:88:193:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:77:6008:27:28:85:190:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Literature review 
4:78:6028:28:27:120:515:138:144:Times:144:Times:A:Khorana  et  al.  (2009)  examine  the  consequences  of  the  loss  of  coverage  for  a  
4:79:6119:27:0:85:516:111:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm  over  the  period  from  1983  to  2004.  They  find  that  firms  that  lose  all  analyst  
5:80:6220:0:27:85:515:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage  are  significantly  more  likely  to  get  delisted.  This  study  sheds  light  on  the  
5:81:6320:27:28:85:516:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance  of  analyst  coverage  for  firms.  To  avoid  such  a  situation,  the  firm  may  
5:82:6416:28:27:85:513:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:acquire  the  means  to  attract  financial  analysts  during  its  IPO  process.  Previous  studies  
5:83:6518:27:28:85:515:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:have  found  that  the  underwriting  syndicate  and  the  presence  of  venture  capitalists  or  
5:84:6617:28:28:85:514:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutional investors in the IPO, as well as underpricing, allow the firm to increase its 
5:85:6709:28:37:85:240:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability of analyst coverage. 
5:86:6742:37:28:120:514:570:144:Times:144:Times:A:Krigman et al. (2001) reveal that changes in underwriters (between an IPO and 
5:87:6820:28:27:85:513:542:144:Times:144:Times:B:an SEO) are made because the firm wants more reputable underwriters that will provide 
5:88:6906:27:28:85:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:more  coverage.  The  authors  find  that  firms  are  more  likely  to  make  changes  when  
5:89:7000:28:28:85:515:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyst  coverage  is  not  to  their  liking.  In  addition,  firms  do  not  hesitate  to  allocate  
5:90:7103:28:27:85:514:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:resources  to  improving  their  coverage.  According  to  Ellis  et  al.  (2005),  almost  50  per  
5:91:7204:27:28:85:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent  of  firms  making  an  SEO  change  their  lead  underwriters.  This  change  takes  place  
5:92:7302:28:27:85:513:404:144:Times:144:Times:B:not because of the reputation of the underwriter but for the coverage of analysts whose 
5:93:7390:27:28:85:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:buy recommendation are often more favourable than those of their predecessors. Corwin 
5:94:7476:28:28:85:515:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  Schultz  (2005)  examine  the  underwriting  syndicates  of  1638  IPOs  between  1997  
5:95:7569:28:27:85:514:321:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 2002 in the United States. They emphasise the importance of co-managers, stating 
5:96:7654:27:28:85:513:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the addition of a co-manager to the syndicate increases analyst coverage within the 
5:97:7743:28:27:85:513:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:3 months after the IPO. Loughran and Ritter (2004) find that co-managers are included 
5:98:7829:27:38:85:360:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:in syndicates exclusively to provide additional coverage. 
5:99:7887:38:28:120:513:201:144:Times:144:Times:A:The presence of venture capitalists in the IPO may encourage analysts to follow 
5:100:7967:28:27:85:515:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  firm.  Several  studies  note  a  positive  relationship  between  the  presence  of  venture  
5:101:8067:27:28:85:516:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalists  in  the  IPO  and  analyst  coverage.  Jain  and  Kini  (2000)  find  that  venture  
5:102:8165:28:27:85:516:118:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalists  influence  institutional  investors,  investment  bankers  and  their  analysts  to  
5:103:8263:27:0:85:514:91:144:Times:144:Times:B:ensure the success of the IPO process. This influence is the result of many interactions, 
6:104:8355:0:27:85:514:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially  with  underwriters.  Gompers  and  Lerner  (1997)  estimate  that  approximately  
6:105:8449:27:28:85:516:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:25  per  cent  of  venture  capitalists  have  an  affiliation  with  underwriters.  A  venture  
6:106:8546:28:27:85:514:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalist involved in an IPO can advise its underwriter and vice versa1. These types of 
6:107:8635:27:28:85:516:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:interactions  also  arise  between  venture  capitalists  and  financial  analysts.  Therefore,  
6:108:8732:28:28:85:518:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:venture   capitalists   can   attract   underwriters   and   thus   facilitate   analyst   coverage.   
6:109:8835:28:27:85:514:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:According  to  Chemmanur  and  Loutskina  (2006),  the  presence  of  venture  capitalists  in  
6:110:8931:27:28:85:334:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:an IPO leads 0.22 more analysts to follow the firm. 
6:111:8983:28:27:120:515:552:144:Times:144:Times:A:Rajan  and  Servaes  (1997)  and  Aggarwal  et  al.  (2002)  argue  that  underpricing  
6:112:9071:27:28:85:513:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:attracts an analyst following. Cliff and Denis (2004) find that underpricing is positively 
6:113:9162:28:28:85:514:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to analyst coverage. The authors empirically examine the assumption that firms 
6:114:9249:28:27:85:515:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:attract  analyst  coverage  through  underpricing.  They  study  1050  firms  conducting  an  
6:115:9343:27:28:85:517:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPO  and  an  SEO  between  1993  and  2000  and  find  a  strong  correlation  between  
6:116:9432:28:27:85:513:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:underpricing and the frequency and quality of post-IPO analyst coverage. A total of 94 
6:117:9519:27:28:85:513:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:per cent of highly underpriced firms receive initial analyst coverage compared to 84 per

6:119:9704:28:27:85:514:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensates,  in  part,  for  expected  analyst  coverage.  James  and  Karceski  (2006)  note  
6:120:9800:27:28:85:516:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  IPO  firms  that  have  not  benefited  from  analyst  coverage  are  significantly  less  
6:121:9897:28:27:85:513:276:144:Times:144:Times:B:underpriced (average of 27 per cent) compared with those covered by financial analysts 
6:122:9984:27:28:85:514:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:(average  of  72  per  cent)  over  the  period  from  1999-2000.  Das  et  al.  (2006)  show  that  
6:123:10085:28:28:85:513:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPOs with low (high) analyst coverage exhibit underpricing close to 13 per cent (47 per 
6:124:10173:28:27:85:516:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent)  over  the  period  from  1986  to  2000.  In  contrast,  Bradley  et  al  (2008a)  do  not  
6:125:10272:27:28:85:513:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:establish any link between underpricing and analyst coverage following 683 IPOs from 
6:126:10357:28:0:85:154:138:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999 to 2000. 
7:127:10373:0:27:120:514:745:144:Times:144:Times:A:Ownership structure also affects analyst coverage. Bhushan (1989) and O'Brien 
7:128:10451:27:28:85:514:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  Bhushan  (1990)  find  that  the  likelihood  of  analyst  coverage  is  associated  with  the  
7:129:10552:28:27:85:515:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:interests  of  institutional  investors  in  the  firm.  The  authors  conclude  that  there  is  a  
7:130:10653:27:28:85:516:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive  relationship  between  institutional  investor  ownership  and  analyst  coverage.  
7:131:10747:28:28:85:516:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lang  et  al.  (2004)  and  Boubaker  and  Labegorre  (2008)  indicate  that  analysts  are  
7:132:10840:28:27:85:514:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:reluctant to cover a firm managed by controlling family members. This is explained, in 
7:133:10927:27:28:85:516:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:part,  by  the  reliance  of  these  firms  on  private  communication  channels  rather  than  
7:134:11023:28:27:85:392:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:public disclosure, producing a poor informational environment.

7:137:11129:28:27:85:181:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1 - Methodology: 
7:138:11148:27:28:120:516:442:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  results  of  long-run  performance  studies  are  sensitive  to  methodological  
7:139:11234:28:27:85:514:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:choices.  We  therefore  present  our  results  using  two  frequently  used  and  recommended  
7:140:11330:27:28:85:410:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:methodologies (Brav and Gompers, 1997; Barber and Lyon, 1997). 
7:141:11393:28:28:120:516:359:144:Times:144:Times:A:First,  we  use  the  calendar-time  approach  of  Fama  and  French  (1996).  Their  
7:142:11479:28:27:85:510:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:three-factor model assumes that the expected return on a portfolio in excess of the risk-
7:143:11568:27:28:85:513:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:free rate [(ERi) – Rf ] is explained by the sensitivity of its return to three factors: (i) the 
7:144:11664:28:27:85:515:276:144:Times:144:Times:B:excess  return  on  a  broad  market  portfolio  (RM  –  Rf);  (ii)  the  difference  between  the  
7:145:11764:27:28:85:514:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:return  on  a  portfolio  of  small  stocks  and  the  return  on  a  portfolio  of  big  stocks  (SMB,  
7:146:11869:28:28:85:509:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:small minus big); and (iii) the difference between the return on a portfolio of high-book-
7:147:11959:28:27:85:513:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:to-market stocks and the return on a portfolio of low-book-to-market stocks (HML, high 
7:148:12046:27:28:85:418:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:minus low). Specifically, the expected excess return on portfolio i is,

8:151:12257:27:28:85:514:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate,  E (RM)  is  the  monthly  return  on  an  equally  weighted  market  portfolio  of  NYSE,  
8:152:12354:28:27:85:516:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:AMEX,  and  NASDAQ  stocks,  E(SMB)  is  the  difference  between  the  returns  on  
8:153:12439:27:28:85:515:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolios  of  small  and  big  stocks  (below  or  above  the  median),  and  E(HML)  is  the  
8:154:12536:28:28:85:515:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference  between  the  returns  on  portfolios  of  high  and  low  book-to-market  stocks

8:156:12701:27:28:120:514:580:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second,  we  use  an  event-time  approach,  as  in  the  study  of  Brav  and  Gompers  
8:157:12790:28:27:85:515:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1997).  Fama  and  French  (1992,  1993)  have  shown  that  the  size  and  book-to-market  
8:158:12884:27:28:85:513:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolios are important determinants of the cross section of stock returns. We compare 
8:159:12972:28:28:85:514:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  performance  of  IPOs  with  that  of  size  and  book-to-market  portfolios.  Starting  in  
8:160:13070:28:27:85:514:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:January  1991,  we  use  all  NYSE,  AMEX,  and  NASDAQ  stocks  to  create  size  quartile  
8:161:13163:27:28:85:513:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:breakpoints with an equal number of firms in each size quartile. Size is measured by the 
8:162:13252:28:27:85:513:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of shares outstanding multiplied by the stock price at the end of the preceding 
8:163:13339:27:28:85:518:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:month.   The   monthly   book-to-market   data   for   each   firm   are   extracted   from   the   
8:164:13439:28:28:85:518:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:Datastream   database.   Within   each   size   quartile,   we   create   four   book-to-market   
8:165:13537:28:27:85:514:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolios  with  an  equal  number  of  firms  in  each  book-to-market  quartile,  resulting  in  
8:166:13637:27:28:85:514:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:16 size and book-to-market portfolios. Equally weighted returns are calculated for each 
8:167:13725:28:27:85:513:276:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolio. To avoid comparing IPO firms with themselves, we eliminate IPO firms from 
8:168:13810:27:28:85:513:249:144:Times:144:Times:B:the various portfolios for five years after their equity issues. Each issue is matched with 
8:169:13902:28:28:85:275:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:its corresponding benchmark portfolio. 
8:170:13941:28:27:120:515:193:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  Long-run  performance  is  calculated  using  the  BHAR  methodology.  The

9:187:14773:28:28:120:515:499:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  data  come  from  different  sources.  We  first  identify  firms  that  went  public  
9:188:14865:28:27:85:513:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 1991 to 2010 in the Thomson Financial Securities Data Company (SDC) Common 
9:189:14945:27:28:85:513:444:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stock Initial Public Offerings database. Consistent with prior studies, we eliminate IPOs 
9:190:15035:28:27:85:515:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  are  classified  as  ADRs,  REITs,  and  closed-end  funds,  along  with  offerings  that  
9:191:15132:27:28:85:514:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:have  a  file  range  midpoint  of  less  than  €8  and  financial  services  IPO  firms  (SIC  code  
9:192:15234:28:28:85:514:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:6000-6999).  Our  sample  contains  1265  IPOs.  Analyst  data  are  collected  from  the  First  
9:193:15332:28:27:85:155:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:Call database. 
9:194:15347:27:28:85:510:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:Long-run performance is calculated using the Datastream monthly stock price database. 
9:195:15433:28:27:120:517:278:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table  1  presents  descriptive  statistics  for  our  sample.  Panel  A  shows  the  
9:196:15519:27:28:85:514:251:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of the IPO sample over the three sub-periods. Panel B provides the market 
9:197:15606:28:28:85:515:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalization  of  the  IPOs  in  our  sample  at  the  end  of  the  first  month  following  the  
9:198:15707:28:27:85:514:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:offering. Our sample offerings are substantially large in terms of market capitalization. 
9:199:15797:27:28:85:514:168:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  find  that  63  per  cent  of  our  sample’s  IPOs  raise  $200  million  or  more  and  25  per  
9:200:15899:28:0:85:515:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent  of  the  offerings  have  a  capitalization  ranging  from  $50  million  to  $200  million.  
10:201:16001:0:27:85:513:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:Panel C documents that the industry composition of our sample is well-distributed, with

10:205:16186:28:28:120:514:639:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for orphan and non-orphan IPOs. There are 
10:206:16265:28:27:85:513:611:144:Times:144:Times:B:253 IPOs classified as orphans and 1012 classified as non-orphans. The long-term debt 
10:207:16351:27:28:85:514:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  non-orphans  is  higher  than  that  of  orphan  IPOs  (significant  at  the  1  per  cent  level  
10:208:16454:28:27:85:514:556:144:Times:144:Times:B:using w and t tests). The average orphan raises $309.61 million in its IPO, compared to 
10:209:16542:27:28:85:513:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:$1067.46 million for the average non-orphan. This difference is statistically significant 
10:210:16632:28:28:85:513:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:at the 1 per cent level. Like prior research, analyst coverage increases according to firm 
10:211:16723:28:27:85:513:473:144:Times:144:Times:B:size. We find no significant differences in venture capital backing between orphan and 
10:212:16810:27:28:85:514:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-orphan IPOs over the entire period. Orphans are associated with more underwriting 
10:213:16896:28:27:85:510:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:syndicates,  with  a  mean  of  6.86  managing  underwriters,  compared  to  6.48  for  non-
10:214:16988:27:28:85:516:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:orphans  (the  difference  is  statistically  significant  using  a  w  test).  There  is  a  weak  
10:215:17088:28:28:85:515:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship  between  analyst  coverage  and  underpricing.  For  instance,  orphans  have  
10:216:17181:28:27:85:510:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:initial  returns  of  13.85  per  cent  compared  to  15.53  per  cent  for  non-orphans.  Non-
10:217:17276:27:28:85:514:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:orphans are more underpriced than orphans and the difference is statistically significant 
10:218:17366:28:27:85:515:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:at  the  10%  level  using  a  w  test.  Non-orphans  are  associated  with  more  institutional  
10:219:17464:27:28:85:513:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:investor ownership than orphans. For instance, a mean of 73.89 per cent of the shares of 
10:220:17553:28:28:85:515:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPOs  with  analyst  coverage  are  held  by  institutional  investors,  compared  to  31.74  per  
10:221:17652:28:27:85:514:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent  for  orphan  IPO  firms.  The  difference  is  statistically  significant  at  the  1  per  cent  
10:222:17756:27:29:85:299:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:level and is confirmed by both t and w tests.

11:227:17925:28:27:85:514:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns over the entire period. The mean returns of IPOs range from 4.22 per cent over 
11:228:18012:27:28:85:513:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:the first year after their offerings to -16.40 per cent over the five-year horizon. Over the 
11:229:18105:28:28:85:514:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:period from 1991 to 1998, similar to Ritter and Welch (2002), we find that IPOs have, 
11:230:18191:28:27:85:513:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:on average, no abnormal returns regardless of the considered horizon. We also calculate

11:234:18561:28:28:85:518:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:performed  worse  than  expected.  Intercepts  (alpha)  are  positive  regardless  of  the  
11:235:18653:28:27:85:513:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:considered period. The Fama-French model shows that investing in IPO portfolios leads 
11:236:18739:27:28:85:513:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:to a statistically significant (at 1 per cent level) 0.78 per cent return per month over the

11:241:18952:27:28:85:515:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings  are  reported  in  table  4.  We  find  that  market  participants  make  a  relevant  
11:242:19049:28:27:85:509:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:distinction  between  orphan  and  non-oprhan  IPO  firms  over  the  entire  period  (1991-
11:243:19141:27:28:85:513:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010). For instance, the three-year return of non-orphans is -1.17 per cent, compared to 
11:244:19230:28:28:85:513:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:-18.09 per cent for orphan IPOs, and the difference is statistically significant at the 5 per 
11:245:19324:28:27:85:515:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:cent  level.  These  findings  are  confirmed  over  the  five-year  returns.  The  Fama-French  
11:246:19421:27:28:85:514:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:model  shows  that  investing  an  equal  amount  in  non-orphan  IPO  portfolios  provides  a  
11:247:19517:28:27:85:515:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.91  per  cent  return  per  month,  which  is  statistically  significant  (at  the  1%  level),  
11:248:19617:27:0:85:513:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to orphan IPO portfolios (monthly return of 0.11 per cent). The 1990s reveal 
12:249:19706:0:27:85:516:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  the  differences  between  orphan  and  non-orphan  IPOs  appear  in  the  first  year  
12:250:19800:27:28:85:514:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:following  the  offering.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  one-year  returns  show  the  analysts’  
12:251:19902:28:27:85:513:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability to predict the long-run performance before the disclosure of financial statements. 
12:252:19993:27:28:85:513:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:At the time of the IPO, investors are limited to the material information contained in the 
12:253:20084:28:28:85:514:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:prospectus,  and  informational  asymmetries  are  particularly  high.  In  the  first  year  after  
12:254:20185:28:27:85:513:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:the offering, the non-orphans exhibit positive abnormal performance, while the orphans 
12:255:20272:27:28:85:513:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:exhibit no abnormal performance. The internet bubble period (1999-2000) demonstrates 
12:256:20357:28:27:85:513:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar findings. The 2000s reveal the opposite result, meaning that orphan IPOs exhibit 
12:257:20446:27:28:85:513:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher returns than non-orphan IPOs in the first year after their issues. The difference is 
12:258:20538:28:28:85:516:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically  significant  at  the  5  per  cent  level  (not  confirmed  by  the  calendar-time  
12:259:20637:28:27:85:513:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach). This could be attributable to recent scandals involving financial analysts; as 
12:260:20727:27:29:85:447:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:a consequence, analyst coverage may have become worth less to investors.

12:272:21598:27:0:85:513:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:orphan VC-backed IPOs outperform those of their orphan counterparts. The alpha of the

16:348:27429:28:27:85:520:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table   10   reports   our   regression   results   (corrected   for   heteroscedasticity   and   
16:349:27527:27:28:85:516:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:multicollinearity).  We  use  a  2SLS  regression  model  to  account  for  the  endogenous  
16:350:27620:28:28:85:515:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:problem  (i.e.,  that  the  more  valuable  firms  would  likely  attract  more  analysts).  The  
16:351:27718:28:27:85:516:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage  variable  is  endogenous,  and  we  use  instrument  variables  such  as  trading  
16:352:27811:27:28:85:514:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:volume  and  intangibles  that  are  known  to  influence  analyst  coverage  but  not  long-run  
16:353:27909:28:27:85:515:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance  (Bhushan,  1989;  O’Brien  and  Bhushan,  1990;  Barth  et  al.,  2001).  The  
16:354:28001:27:28:85:515:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:results  of  our  model  are  statistically  significant  and  it  helps  to  explain  the  long-run  
16:355:28103:28:28:85:210:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance of US IPOs. 
16:356:28127:28:27:120:514:469:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  find  non-orphan  IPOs  to  be  positively  and  significantly  related  to  long-run  
16:357:28218:27:28:85:513:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance over the five-year horizon, which is broadly consistent with the univariate 
16:358:28306:28:27:85:515:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis  results  given  in  table  3.  This  finding  reveals  that  market  participants  do  not  
16:359:28408:27:28:85:516:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:fully  incorporate  the  perceived  value  of  analyst  coverage.  Both  the  syndicate  and  
16:360:28502:28:28:85:515:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:operating  performance  variables  explain  a  significant  component  of  the  long-run  IPO  
16:361:28597:28:27:85:517:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance   regardless   of   the   considered   horizon.   The   other   variables   (such   as   
16:362:28698:27:28:85:517:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:underpricing,  VC  backing  and  institutional  investors)  fail  to  explain  the  long-run  
16:363:28792:28:29:85:378:276:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance of US IPOs over the period from 1991 to 2010.

16:367:28880:27:28:120:513:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:We examine the long-run performance of US IPOs carried out between 1991 and 
16:368:28956:28:27:85:517:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010  and  find  that  the  IPOs  in  our  sample  performed  negatively  relative  to  the  
16:369:29049:27:0:85:510:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison  portfolio  over  this  period,  but  this  result  varies  substantially  across  sub-
17:370:29150:0:27:85:515:745:144:Times:144:Times:B:periods.  We  compare  the  long-run  performance  of  firms  that  do  not  receive  analyst  
17:371:29245:27:28:85:513:718:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage (orphans) to those that do (non-orphans). This abnormal long-run performance 
17:372:29331:28:27:85:513:690:144:Times:144:Times:B:is considerably more severe for orphan IPOs than for non-orphan IPOs given a three- to 
17:373:29418:27:28:85:514:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:five-year  horizon.  The  evidence  suggests  that  analyst  coverage  is  indeed  important  to  
17:374:29516:28:28:85:514:635:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  issuing  firm  but  the  market  does  not  fully  incorporate  the  perceived  value  of  this  
17:375:29618:28:27:85:514:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage.  Once  we  control  for  other  characteristics  that  have  been  shown  to  influence  
17:376:29717:27:28:85:514:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  long-run  performance  of  IPOs,  we  find  that  investors  and  market  participants  pay  
17:377:29815:28:27:85:515:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:attention  to  analyst  coverage  when  IPOs  have  large  underwriting  syndicates  and  are  
17:378:29910:27:28:85:510:525:144:Times:144:Times:B:highly  underpriced.  The  difference  between  orphans  and  non-orphans  persists  in  VC-
17:379:30002:28:28:85:514:497:144:Times:144:Times:B:backed  and  non-VC-backed  IPOs,  and  whatever  the  ownership  structures  of  the  IPOs.  
17:380:30096:28:27:85:513:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:Notably, however, the 2000s reveals that the difference between orphan and non-orphan 
17:381:30182:27:28:85:514:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:IPO  firms  is  diminishing.  This  trend  may  be  attributable  to  scandals  affecting  analyst  
17:382:30282:28:27:85:514:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, as both regulators and the financial press have identified analyst research that 
17:383:30373:27:28:85:280:387:144:Times:144:Times:B:had been tainted by conflicts of interest. 
17:384:30416:28:28:85:521:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally,    multivariate    regression    analysis    establishes    that    analyst    coverage    is    
17:385:30522:28:27:85:516:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly  related  to  the  long-run  performance  of  IPOs,  contrary  to  the  study  of
