3:49:3137:0:38:90:202:677:197:Times:197:Times:C:I. Introduction
3:50:3151:38:28:126:522:639:144:Times:144:Times:A:Since  the  early  1990s,  there  has  been  an  explosion  in  the  level  of  investment
3:51:3241:28:28:90:522:611:144:Times:144:Times:B:funding  provided  to  technology-oriented  start-up  firms  in  the  United  States.    For
3:52:3333:28:27:90:522:583:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, venture capitalists invested at least $12.5 billion in 1998 in the United States –
3:53:3424:27:28:90:522:556:144:Times:144:Times:B:up  over  five-fold  from  1991  (VentureOne,  2000;  Rausch,  1998)  –  and  venture-backed
3:54:3516:28:27:90:522:528:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms are now estimated to account for 15% of all domestic industrial innovation (Kortum
3:55:3604:27:28:90:522:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Lerner, 1999).  Not surprisingly, there is considerable popular and academic interest
3:56:3693:28:28:90:522:473:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  potential  implications  of  this  surge  in  the  rate  of  R&D  investment  in  small,
3:57:3790:28:27:90:522:445:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrepreneurial   firms   (Gompers   and   Lerner,   1999;   Kortum   and   Lerner,   1999;
3:58:3881:27:28:90:258:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:Christensen, 1997; Strasser, 1999).
3:59:3916:28:27:126:522:390:144:Times:144:Times:A:One  of  the  key  issues  raised  by  the  dramatic  rise  in  venture  financing  is  the
3:60:4007:27:28:90:522:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact  that  the  creation  of  these  new  firms  will  have  on  the  dynamics  of  industrial
3:61:4104:28:28:90:522:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:organization  in  high-technology  industries.    In  this  paper,  we  address  this  issue  by
3:62:4200:28:27:90:522:307:144:Times:144:Times:B:identifying the conditions under which the commercialization strategy chosen by a start-
3:63:4288:27:28:90:522:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:up   firm   tends   to   reinforce   (or,   alternatively,   overturn)   incumbent   market   power.
3:64:4388:28:27:90:522:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically, we provide empirical evidence that whether start-ups compete or cooperate
3:65:4475:27:28:90:522:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:with established firms depends on more fundamental economic factors which shape both
3:66:4559:28:28:90:517:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:the value of cooperation relative to competition and the transactional costs of bargaining.
3:67:4650:28:27:126:522:169:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  approach  builds  upon  two  competing  perspectives  on  the  product  market
3:68:4733:27:28:90:522:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:consequences  of  start-up  innovation.  On  the  one  hand,  many  analysts  suggest  that
3:69:4824:28:27:90:522:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrepreneurial  activity  ushers  in  systematic  industrial  restructuring  in  many  high-
3:70:4917:27:0:90:522:87:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology  industries  –  newly  financed  companies  compete  with  and  then  ultimately
4:71:5009:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:overturn  the  market  power  of  established  firms  (Foster,  1986;  Hobijn  and  Jovanovic,
4:72:5103:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999; Christensen, 1997).  According to this perspective, the small-firm R&D financing
4:73:5189:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:boom  is  accelerating  the  “gale  of  creative  destruction,”  the  process  by  which  new  firms
4:74:5289:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:leverage  the  innovative  process  to  replace  established  firms  within  specific  industrial
4:75:5386:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors (Schumpeter, 1943).  In effect, proponents of this perspective are suggesting that
4:76:5476:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:because  venture  capital  (and  other  financing  institutions  such  as  the  provision  of
4:77:5569:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:government   subsidies   to   technology-oriented   firms)   have   overcome   (or   at   least
4:78:5664:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantially  alleviated)  the  liquidity  and  incentive  dilemmas  which  have  traditionally
4:79:5760:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited  the  level  of  innovative  activity  by  small  firms,  the  rise  of  small  firm  R&D
4:80:5857:28:27:90:453:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:financing will be associated with systematic pro-competitive consequences.
4:81:5931:27:28:126:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:However, both economic theory as well as a slightly more detailed recounting of
4:82:6010:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  facts  associated  with  venture-backed  firms  suggests  that  the  link  between  entrant
4:83:6106:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovative  activity  and  changes  in  market  leadership  may  be  more  nuanced  than
4:84:6194:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:commonly assumed.  Conditional on developing a prototype of a new technology, a start-
4:85:6280:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:up  firm  may  calculate  that  greater  profits  may  be  earned  (in  expectation)  through
4:86:6373:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation  with  established  firms  (either  through  licensing,  joint  venture,  or  outright
4:87:6471:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:acquisition of the potential entrant by the incumbent) rather than through product market
4:88:6560:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition  with  these  same  firms  (Salant,  1984;  Gallini  and  Winter,  1985;  Anton  and
4:89:6656:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Yao,  1995;  Gans  and  Stern,  2000a).  In  such  a  case,  innovation-oriented  start-up  firms
4:90:6753:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:serve  as  upstream  suppliers  of  technology  to  established  firms  rather  than  potential
4:91:6848:27:28:90:324:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:sources of disruption to current market structure.
4:92:6898:28:28:126:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:A:Indeed,  in  the  absence  of  significant  imperfections  which  make  a  bargaining
4:93:6983:28:0:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:agreement  between  start-up  and  incumbent  infeasible,  these  economic  actors  share  two
5:94:7078:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:distinct  gains  from  trade  with  each  other:  (1)  the  preservation  of  current  market  power
5:95:7178:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:within   the   industry   and   (2)   the   opportunity   to   avoid   investment   in   duplicative
5:96:7278:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  assets,  such  as  those  which  might  be  associated  with  distribution,

5:98:7472:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization   does   not   involve   substantial   diseconomies of   scale   or   scope,
5:99:7566:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations of competition in the product market as the result of innovation by a start-up
5:100:7657:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm  reflect  a  prior  market  imperfection  –  in  the  “market  for  ideas.”    If  an  ideas  market
5:101:7762:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:functions well, this allows incumbents to contract for innovations from upstream start-ups
5:102:7852:27:28:90:384:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and so forestall the competitive impact associated with entry.
5:103:7914:28:27:126:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Of  course,  these  theoretical  concerns  would  be  of  only  limited  interest  if,  in
5:104:8004:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:reality, start-up innovators exclusively chose to earn their returns through product market
5:105:8095:28:27:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition.1    However,  even  a  sector-level  examination  of  commercialization  strategy
5:106:8189:27:28:90:522:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:patterns suggests important heterogeneity.  For example, in biotechnology, some form of
5:107:8276:28:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation  is  the  norm  (whether  through  licensing,  strategic  alliances  or  outright
5:108:8369:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:acquisition),  while  in  some  areas  of  electronics,  such  as  the  disk  drive  sector,  start-up
5:109:8471:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms  consistently  earn  their  returns  through  direct  participation  in  the  product  market
5:110:8570:28:28:90:401:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Orsenegio, 1989; Lerner and Merges, 1998; Christensen, 1997).
5:111:8632:28:27:126:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:Motivated  by  this  observed  variation  in  entrant  commercialization  strategy,  this
5:112:8721:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper focuses on the economic drivers of the commercialization path of research-oriented
5:113:8809:28:41:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up  firms.    In  particular,  we  document  the  linkage  between  small  firm  R&D  and
5:114:8904:41:7:90:234:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
5:115:8952:7:16:90:522:136:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 Indeed, while the earliest empirical studies of the sources of returns from innovation typically found that
5:116:9061:16:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:“cooperation”  (as  proxied  by  technology  licensing)  was  associated  with  modest  revenues  (Scherer,  1965;
5:117:9175:12:11:90:522:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:Caves,  Crookwell,  and  Killing,  1983),    more  recent  analyses  have  noted  that  (a)  cooperation  can  take
5:118:9290:11:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:numerous  forms,  from  licensing  to  strategic  alliances  to  outright  acquisition)  and  that  (b)  an  increasing
5:119:9409:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:share of start-up returns seem to be associated with such strategies (US DOJ Licensing Guidelines, 1995;
5:120:9513:12:0:90:345:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:Arora, 1995; Chesbrough and Teece, 1998; VentureOne, 1999).
6:121:9573:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:creative destruction by explicitly examining the strategic choices made by start-up firms
6:122:9662:28:27:90:329:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:after they have developed a prototype technology.
6:123:9711:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  analysis  begins  with  a  simple  theoretical  model  of  the  commercialization
6:124:9797:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:decision   of   start-up   firms.      While   both   incumbents   and   innovator   start-ups   have
6:125:9898:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives to avoid head-to-head competition or duplication of sunk investments, several
6:126:9986:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:factors may affect the probability of cooperation by introducing bargaining imperfections
6:127:10075:28:28:90:294:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:or changing the economies to cooperation.
6:128:10116:28:27:126:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:First,  a  principal  benefit  from  cooperation  is  the  ability  of  start-up  innovators  to
6:129:10212:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:exploit  “complementary  assets”  held  by  incumbent  firms,  such  as  through  their  control
6:130:10308:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:over   distribution   channels,   regulatory   or   manufacturing   expertise,   or   brand-name
6:131:10404:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:recognition  (Teece,  1986).    While  avoiding  duplication  of  these  sunk  assets  will  be
6:132:10499:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:important  in  fostering  cooperation  in  some  environments  (such  as  when  biotechnology
6:133:10592:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms   are   able   to   exploit   the   regulatory   expertise   of   established   pharmaceutical
6:134:10692:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:companies),  incumbent-held  assets  will  confer  minimal  value  to  start-up  innovators  in
6:135:10787:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:other  settings  (for  example,  when  the  start-up  innovator  has  developed  an  incompatible
6:136:10884:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology).    Whereas  previous  researchers  have  focused  on  how  asymmetries  in  sunk
6:137:10977:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:assets affect the distribution of  returns  from  innovation  (Teece,  1986;  Bresnahan,  Stern,
6:138:11073:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  Trajtenberg,  1997),  our  model  suggests  that  such  differences  may  also  drive
6:139:11163:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy:  as  the  relative  “cost”  of  competing  increase,  entrants  will
6:140:11260:28:27:90:497:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:tend to forgo competition and instead earn their returns through the market for ideas.
6:141:11346:27:28:126:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second,  identifying  and  contracting  with  incumbent  commercialization  partners
6:142:11430:28:28:90:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:may involve “search” or transactional costs.  Even when intellectual property (IP) rights
6:143:11519:28:0:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:are well defined, there may be uncertainty about the value (or other characteristics) of the
7:144:11612:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up  technology;  such  disagreements  necessitate  detailed  bargaining  between  the
7:145:11703:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:parties  about  royalty  rates  and  other  contingent  contracting  provisions  (Fosfuri,  Arora,
7:146:11801:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Gambardella, 1999).  In this case, the presence of bargaining “intermediaries” (such
7:147:11889:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  venture  capitalists  or  specialized  legal  counsel)  may  substantially  reduce  the  cost  of
7:148:11990:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:forging  an  agreement  between  the  two  parties  (Fosfuri,  Arora,  and  Gambardella,  1999;
7:149:12085:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:Burt,   2000).      Accordingly,   as   bargaining   costs   decrease,   the   relative   returns   to
7:150:12187:28:28:90:192:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation increase.
7:151:12208:28:27:126:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally,  there  is  a  contracting  hazard  inherent  in  the  nature  of  the  innovative
7:152:12299:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:process:  bargaining  between  entrant  and  incumbent  requires  the  start-up  to  disclose  the
7:153:12397:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:idea to the established firm (Arrow, 1962).  In the absence of complete IP protection, the
7:154:12487:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:established firm may be able to expropriate the economic value of the entrant’s invention
7:155:12576:28:27:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:through imitation.2  This disclosure hazard will be particularly salient when IP rights are
7:156:12667:27:28:90:522:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:weak  and  so  disclosed  information  substantially  reduces  the  cost  of  imitation  by  the
7:157:12763:28:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbent (Merges and Nelson, 1991; Anton and Yao, 1994).  In such a case, a start-up
7:158:12848:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovator  may  choose  to  earn  the  rents  on  its  innovation  through  the  product  market  in
7:159:12948:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:order  to  avoid  disclosing  technical  information  to  the  incumbent.3    Or,  stated  another
7:160:13046:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:way,   while   IP   likely   increases   the   absolute   returns   to   innovation   regardless   of
7:161:13147:28:27:90:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization strategy, IP also increases the relative returns to cooperation in many
7:162:13236:27:28:90:391:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:cases, precisely because it reduces the hazard of expropriation.
7:163:13300:28:27:126:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:A:The   main   contribution   of   this   paper   is   to   evaluate   empirically   whether
7:164:13390:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:environments that differ along each of these dimensions – complementary assets, the cost
7:165:13478:28:7:90:234:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
7:166:13526:7:16:90:522:122:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 Of course, if the start-up innovator’s technology builds upon the inventions of the incumbent, an optimal
7:167:13633:16:12:90:522:106:99:Times:99:Times:F:IP  regime  would  compensate  the  incumbent  for  part  of  the  value  generated  by  the  follow-on  innovator’s
7:168:13749:12:0:90:331:94:99:Times:99:Times:F:technology (Scotchmer, 1991; Green and Scotchmer, 1995).
8:169:13806:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:of contracting, and the strength of intellectual property – are associated with substantially
8:170:13899:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:different  start-up  innovator  commercialization  patterns.    Perhaps  surprisingly,  little
8:171:13993:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical  work  has  been  devoted  to  this  topic.  By  and  large,  prior  analyses  of  the
8:172:14089:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationship  between  start-up  and  established  firms  have  tended  to  focus  on  the  relative
8:173:14189:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives to innovate in the first place, under the assumption that innovation by a start-
8:174:14280:27:28:90:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:up  will  be  followed  by  product  market  competition  with  more  established  firms.4  As
8:175:14374:28:27:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:well, several analyses have examined the form of cooperation between smaller research-
8:176:14460:27:28:90:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:oriented  firms  and  larger  more  established  firms  without  considering  the  potential for
8:177:14555:28:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:product  market  entry.5    By  relating  the  choice between  cooperation  and  competition  to
8:178:14651:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the   firm’s   economic   environment,   our   analysis   suggests   that   the   competitive
8:179:14744:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:consequences   of   start-up   innovation   are   endogenous.      Specifically,   the   industrial
8:180:14843:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:organization  consequences  of  the  small-firm  R&D  financing  boom  depend  on  factors
8:181:14933:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:such as the strength of intellectual property and the availability of venture capital, which
8:182:15025:27:28:90:467:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:are themselves determined, at least in part, by various aspects of public policy.
8:183:15106:28:27:126:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:We investigate the determinants of the commercialization path of a group of 118
8:184:15185:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:small research-oriented firms, split almost equally between enterprises funded by venture
8:185:15274:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital and the US Federal government through the Small Business Innovation Research
8:186:15358:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Program.  We analyze three main hypotheses derived from our theoretical model.  First,
8:187:15444:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  consider  whether  innovations  that  receive  some  formal  IP  protection  (e.g.,  a  patent)
8:188:15543:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  associated  with  higher  levels  of  cooperative  activity.    Second,  we  examine  whether
8:189:15641:27:8:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
8:190:15785:8:16:90:522:149:42:Times:99:Times:F:3 Anton and Yao (1995) were the first to explicitly evaluate how the disclosure problem and the potential
8:191:15890:16:7:90:486:133:99:Times:99:Times:F:for expropriation impact the bargaining equilibrium between an incumbent and a potential start-up.
8:192:15988:7:16:90:522:126:42:Times:99:Times:F:4  The  literature  on  R&D  and  product  market  competition  between  incumbents  and  start-up  firms  is  too
8:193:16102:16:11:90:522:110:99:Times:99:Times:F:large to be summarized here, but see, for example, Schumpeter, 1943; Scherer, 1965; Gilbert and Newbery,
8:194:16206:11:12:90:522:99:99:Times:99:Times:F:1982; Reinganum, 1983; Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Cohen and Levin, 1989; Scotchmer, 1991; Scherer,
8:195:16304:12:0:90:470:87:99:Times:99:Times:F:1992; Henderson, 1993; Cockburn and Henderson, 1994; Lerner, 1997; and Christensen, 1997.
9:196:16394:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up innovators who have access to control over downstream complementary product
9:197:16478:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:market assets (e.g., distribution channels or manufacturing capability) are more likely to
9:198:16568:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:vertically integrate into the product market.  Finally, we consider whether start-up firms
9:199:16658:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  have  access  to  networks  of  contacts  (e.g.,  through  a  relationship  with  a  venture
9:200:16756:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalist) are more likely to be able to contract with potential commercialization partners
9:201:16848:27:28:90:265:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:as the result of lower “search costs.”
9:202:16886:28:28:126:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:On  their  face,  our  empirical  results  are  striking.    Each  of  the  above  factors  –
9:203:16979:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:control  over  intellectual  property,  the  attractiveness  of  control  over  complementary
9:204:17072:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:assets, and association with venture capitalists – is associated with a significant effect on
9:205:17165:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the probability of cooperation by our sample of start-up innovators.  For example, firms
9:206:17253:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  possess  intellectual  property  are  estimated  to  be  23%  more  likely  than  non-patent-
9:207:17352:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:holders to cooperate as part of their commercialization strategy.  Moreover, our empirical
9:208:17442:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings  are  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  a  variety  of  controls  and  to  focusing  on  within-
9:209:17545:27:28:90:262:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry or cross-industry variation.

9:211:17666:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:cautious  about  interpreting  our  results  as  a  dispositive  test  of  our  theory  of  start-up
9:212:17766:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy.  Our  empirical  measures  are  imperfect:    even  though  we
9:213:17857:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:include a large number of control variables, our results may be subject to bias.  However,
9:214:17947:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the chief “candidate “ for bias – conflating strong intellectual property or association with
9:215:18040:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:venture capitalists with “high-quality” projects – will likely generate bias in the opposite
9:216:18132:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:direction of both our theory and empirical results.  To see this more clearly, suppose that
9:217:18223:28:31:90:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:control  over  IP  (or  association  with  venture  capitalists)  is  simply  proxying  for  “high-

10:222:18696:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  our  measures  of  IP  protection  or  lower  bargaining  costs  would  be  associated  with
10:223:18794:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher  rates  of  independent  product  market  entry  by  technological  innovators  (Foster,
10:224:18889:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:1986; Shan, 1990; Pisano, 1990), precisely the opposite of our theoretical predictions and
10:225:18979:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical findings.  In other words, despite the relatively small size of our sample and our
10:226:19071:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:imperfect ability to measure the precise concepts underlying the theoretical model, we are
10:227:19161:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:able  to  demonstrate  a  fairly  robust  set  of  empirical  findings  which  accord  with  a  simple

10:230:19381:28:27:126:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the next section motivates the
10:231:19464:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:study by highlighting the heterogeneity of cooperation across technological sectors.  We
10:232:19552:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:then  develop  a  simple  model  exploring  the  economics  of  commercialization  strategies.
10:233:19646:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:After a brief review of our data, we present our principal empirical results in Section V.
10:234:19736:27:60:90:215:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:A final section concludes.
10:235:19762:60:38:90:307:290:197:Times:197:Times:C:II. What is the Empirical Puzzle?
10:236:19794:38:27:126:522:252:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our   analysis   is   motivated   by   a   simple   but   important   puzzle:   start-up
10:237:19882:27:28:90:522:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy  varies  substantially  across  industrial  sectors.    On  the  one
10:238:19978:28:28:90:522:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:hand, some research-intensive sectors are subject to a high rate of “creative destruction,”
10:239:20069:28:27:90:522:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:whereby start-up innovation followed by product market entry serves as a key mechanism
10:240:20155:27:33:90:521:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  which  incumbent  market  power  is  overturned.6    For  example,  in  the  hard  disk  drive
10:241:20253:33:7:90:234:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
10:242:20301:7:16:90:522:102:42:Times:99:Times:F:6  While  Schumpeter  (1943)  pioneered  the  study  of  the  relationship  between  innovation  and  market
10:243:20409:16:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:structure, it was not until more systematic empirical anlysis began in the 1960s that the ambiguous nature
10:244:20515:12:0:90:522:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:of  the  relationship  between  innovation  and  market  power  became  apparent  (Scherer,  1965;  Cohen  and
11:245:20626:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry,  each  “generation”  of  technology  (where  a  generation  is  defined  according  to
11:246:20722:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:disk  drive  size)  has  been  pioneered  by  an  entrant  firm  (see  Figure  A,  drawn  from
11:247:20816:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:Christensen,  1997);  as  well,  the  market  leader  associated  with  any  one  generation  of
11:248:20912:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology  has  not  been  the  market  leader  in  the  immediately  preceding  generation  of
11:249:21008:28:27:90:146:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:technology.
11:250:21019:27:28:126:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:A:On the other hand, in other industrial sectors, a high rate of innovation by start-up
11:251:21104:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:research-oriented   firms   is   associated   not   with   creative   destruction   but   with   the
11:252:21204:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:reinforcement of incumbent market power.  Consider the biotechnology industry.  While
11:253:21289:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  radical  technical  and  scientific  breakthroughs  promised  by  biotechnology  were
11:254:21379:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:heralded originally as a force for creative destruction (USOTA, 1984), market leadership
11:255:21467:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:has  remained  relatively  constant  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  over  the  past  25  years.
11:256:21566:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:As suggested by Table 1, not one of the ten largest independent pharmaceutical firms in
11:257:21653:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:1997 have their origins in biotechnology; indeed, seven of the top ten firms in 1997 were
11:258:21742:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:among the top fifteen leaders by sales in 1973, and the remaining three – Abbott, Baxter,
11:259:21831:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  SmithKline  Beecham  –  all  have  their  origins  in  the  traditional  pharmaceutical
11:260:21923:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:business   and   were   well-established   prior   to   the   beginnings   of   the   biotechnology
11:261:22022:28:28:90:153:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:“revolution.”
11:262:22035:28:27:126:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:This is not to suggest that biotechnology products have not been commercialized.
11:263:22115:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Indeed, by 1997, over 55% of all new products approved by the FDA in the United States
11:264:22201:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  based,  at  least  in  part,  on  discoveries  and  drugs  developed  with  the  tools  of
11:265:22296:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:biotechnology  (Bioworld,  1998).    As  well,  the  internal  R&D  departments  of  established
11:266:22392:28:28:90:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:pharmaceutical  firms  do  not  make  the  initial  discoveries  of  the  vast  majority  of  these
11:267:22491:28:11:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
11:268:22635:11:12:90:522:90:99:Times:99:Times:F:Levin, 1989).  More recently, the majority of empirical work in this area has been undertaken by scholars in
11:269:22743:12:0:90:522:78:99:Times:99:Times:F:the strategic management of technology and organizational sociology  (Foster, 1986; Henderson and Clark,
12:270:22849:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:biotechnology  products;  instead,  they  represent  the  innovative  outputs  of  research-
12:271:22941:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:oriented  biotechnology  firms  who  chose  to  cooperate  with  at  least  one  incumbent
12:272:23031:27:28:90:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:pharmaceutical   firm   in   the   commercialization   process   (BioWorld,   1998).7  This
12:273:23122:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization pattern allows for a high rate of innovation by start-up firms alongside
12:274:23212:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:stability  in  product  market  structure;  incumbent  firms  avoid  competition  from  potential
12:275:23309:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up  firms  by  choosing  to  cooperate  through  one  of  a  number  of  strategies,  from
12:276:23405:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:licensing  to  the  formation  of  strategic  alliances  to  outright  acquisition  of  the  start-up  by
12:277:23510:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the incumbent firm.  In other words, in contrast to the disk drive industry where start-up
12:278:23600:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovators   tend   to   earn   their   returns   through   competition   in   the   product   market,
12:279:23702:28:27:90:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:biotechnology firms tend to earn their returns on innovation through the market for ideas.
12:280:23792:27:28:126:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  challenge  is  therefore  to  identify  the  key  factors  which  differentiate  these
12:281:23883:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors    and    evaluate    whether    those    factors    help    explain    start-up    innovator
12:282:23984:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy  patterns  more  generally.    We  do  so  by  developing  a  simple
12:283:24080:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:but illustrative model of commercialization strategy in which a small set of key factors –
12:284:24170:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbent sunk assets, search costs, and the intellectual property protection afforded the
12:285:24260:27:60:90:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up innovator – affect the relative attractiveness of cooperation versus competition.

12:287:24407:38:28:126:522:197:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this section, we develop a theoretical model aimed at understanding the factors
12:288:24489:28:37:90:522:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  drive  a  cooperative  as  opposed  to  competitive  commercialization  choice  by  small
12:289:24584:37:12:90:522:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:

12:291:24770:7:16:90:522:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:7 While “...the [stock market capitalization] value of the biotech industry is about $77B, and the value of
12:292:24877:16:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:Merck is $127B...[biotech has] 350 products in clinical trials whereas Merck has about 25...[At the same
12:293:24981:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:time] the biotech companies have roughly 20 times more drugs [than Merck] in late-stage, Phase III trials.”

13:295:25113:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms.    We  focus  on  whether  a  start-up  innovator  who  has  successfully  developed  a
13:296:25207:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially   commercializable   innovation   cooperates   or   competes   with   a   single
13:297:25299:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbent.8    Consider  a  start-up  innovator,  E,  who  has  developed  a  commercializable
13:298:25393:28:28:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation.9  E  then  faces  a  choice  of  entering  the  product  market  by  making  those
13:299:25487:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments  itself  –  the  competitive  strategy  –  or  ‘selling’  the  innovation  to  a  single
13:300:25587:27:28:90:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbent, I  –  the  cooperative  strategy.  The  sale  of  the  innovation  itself  may  occur
13:301:25683:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:through a licensing agreement, a strategic alliance or outright acquisition of E’s assets by
13:302:25775:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:I.        Of  course,  these  strategies  are  themselves  differentiated  in  terms  of  their  impact  on
13:303:25882:27:28:90:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:future  incentives  to  innovate  and  the  locus  of  control  over  ultimate  decisionmaking.
13:304:25977:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, the key, common feature of these cooperative strategies is that, if an agreement
13:305:26066:27:28:90:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  reached,  I  is  able  to  foreclose  on  direct  competition  with  E  in  the  product  market,
13:306:26167:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:thereby  achieving  the  monopoly  profits  associated  with  control  over  the  prices  of  both
13:307:26265:28:27:90:196:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:old and new products.
13:308:26286:27:28:126:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:While E  can  exploit  the  innovation  if  it  enters  the  product  market,  I  can  only
13:309:26377:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:exploit  the  innovation  if  it  contracts  with  E  or  it  replicates  the  innovation  after  E’s
13:310:26478:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:disclosures  during  negotiations.    To  denote  the  difference  in  payoffs  associated  with
13:311:26574:28:28:90:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbent control over the innovation, let a = 1 if the incumbent controls the innovation
13:312:26663:28:27:90:316:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(by contracting or replication) and 0 otherwise.

13:314:26759:7:16:90:522:205:42:Times:99:Times:F:8 While our model examines strategic interaction between a start-up innovator and a single incumbent, the
13:315:26864:16:12:90:522:189:99:Times:99:Times:F:underlying  economic  forces  are  more  general  and  apply  to  an  environment  where  a  start-up  innovator
13:316:26976:12:12:90:522:177:99:Times:99:Times:F:considers  whether  to  enter  the  product  market  as  an  independent  firm  or  whether  to  cooperate  with  one
13:317:27093:12:11:90:522:165:99:Times:99:Times:F:among  a  number  of  established  firms.    A  more  inclusive  theoretical  treatment  would  consider  the
13:318:27202:11:12:90:522:154:99:Times:99:Times:F:possibility of non-exclusive cooperative behavior (e.g., through non-exclusive licensing), distinguish more
13:319:27309:12:11:90:522:142:99:Times:99:Times:F:carefully between different types of cooperative strategies (e.g., the distinction between licensing, strategic
13:320:27420:11:11:90:522:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:alliances,  or  outright  acquisition),  allow  for  imitation  in  the  absence  of  negotiations,  and  consider  the
13:321:27539:11:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:conduct between competing firms in the case of product market entry.  Our simpler approach highlights the
13:322:27644:12:7:90:501:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:salient economic tradeoffs raised by the cooperation decision with unambiguous empirical predictions.
13:323:27745:7:16:90:522:101:42:Times:99:Times:F:9  A  “commercializable”  innovation  is  defined  so  that  R&D  has  resolved  all  of  the  technical  uncertainties
13:324:27864:16:0:90:522:85:99:Times:99:Times:F:associated  with  the  technology  (i.e.,  there  exists  a  working  prototype  technology)  and  so,  with  known
14:325:27981:0:30:126:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  Table  2,  we  define  the  joint  profits  of  E  and  I  under  the  two  alternative
14:326:28072:30:30:90:522:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization scenarios.  Let (  )πma equal the level of monopoly profits that arise if
14:327:28163:30:29:90:522:649:144:Times:144:Times:B:I does not face product market competition from E; either because they cooperate or entry
14:328:28252:29:30:90:521:620:144:Times:144:Times:B:is not profitable for E.  (.)cIπ and (.)cEπ represents the profits under competition between
14:329:28344:30:28:90:522:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:I and E, respectively.  In addition, if E competes in the product market, E must invest K
14:330:28433:28:29:90:522:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:in   “duplicative”   commercialization   assets   already   possessed   by   the   incumbent.
14:331:28526:29:30:90:427:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:Investments which either firm must incur are incorporated into (1)mπ.
14:332:28595:30:28:126:522:503:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 2 distinguishes between environments by whether product market entry by
14:333:28672:28:29:90:521:475:144:Times:144:Times:B:E is credible.  When entry is not credible (that is, E’s  payoff  under  competition  are  less
14:334:28767:29:30:90:521:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:than K),  then  I  continues  to  earn  its  pre-innovation  monopoly  profits  ((0)mπ)  if  a
14:335:28861:30:28:90:522:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperative outcome is not reached.  On the other hand, if entry is credible, entry results
14:336:28952:28:27:90:522:388:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  duopoly  (rather  than  monopoly)  profits,  the  level  and  allocation  of  which  depend  on
14:337:29051:27:28:90:522:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether I competes  “head-to-head”  with  E  through  imitation  of  the  innovation  as  the
14:338:29144:28:30:90:522:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:result  of  disclosure  during  (failed)  negotiations.    Finally,  if  cooperation  is  achieved,  the
14:339:29248:30:31:90:521:303:144:Times:144:Times:B:joint  profits  are  equal  to  (1)πm,  the  distribution  of  which  depends  on  the  relative
14:340:29344:31:31:90:522:272:144:Times:144:Times:B:bargaining  power  of  E  and  I.    Let  γ   equal  the  fraction  of  (1)πmthat E  receives  as  the
14:341:29446:31:40:90:362:241:144:Times:144:Times:B:result of a Nash bargaining equilibrium between E and I.
14:342:29502:40:31:90:250:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:Efficient Bargaining Equilibrium
14:343:29534:31:28:126:522:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  analysis  begins  under  a  scenario  of  efficient  bargaining  conditions  –  that  is,
14:344:29628:28:28:90:522:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:so long as there are positive gains to trade between I and E, we assume that an agreement
14:345:29717:28:27:90:522:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  reached  in  equilibrium,  and,  moreover,  E  faces  no  risk  in  pursuing  negotiations  (we
14:346:29816:27:12:90:522:87:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
14:347:29960:12:0:90:522:75:99:Times:99:Times:F:additional investments on product market entry (e.g., to set up manufacturing or distribution facilities), the
15:348:30072:0:28:90:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:incorporate  various  bargaining  imperfections  below).    In  other  words,  E  neither  incurs
15:349:30169:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed  costs  to  begin  bargaining  nor  weakens  its  potential  competitive  position  as  the
15:350:30266:27:28:90:273:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:result of disclosure during bargaining.
15:351:30305:28:28:126:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:Under  conditions  of  efficient  bargaining,  a  cooperative  outcome  will  be  chosen
15:352:30393:28:29:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:whenever the industry profits from cooperation exceed those from competition, in which
15:353:30479:29:30:90:522:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:case I  must  pay  E  at  least  the  amount  that  E  would  earn  under  competition,  (0)π−cEK.
15:354:30577:30:28:90:522:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:More  precisely,  we  assume  that  E  and  I divide  the  surplus  that  remains  after  having
15:355:30673:28:27:90:327:511:144:Times:65:Times:B:compensated E for forgoing this outside option.10
15:356:30722:27:30:126:522:484:144:Times:144:Times:A:In other words, in an environment where product market entry is not credible (i.e.,
15:357:30805:30:32:105:521:454:144:Times:144:Times:A:(0)cEKπ<), I  continues  to  earn  pre-innovation  monopoly  profits  unless  a  cooperative
15:358:30897:32:32:90:521:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:agreement  is  reached.    As  such,  cooperation  occurs  only  if  (1)(0)mmππ≥  (i.e.,  the
15:359:30990:32:29:90:522:390:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation  adds  value).    On  the  other  hand,  when  entry  is  credible  (i.e.,  (0)cEKπ≥),
15:360:31087:29:30:90:522:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation  ensures  the  continuation  of  monopoly  profits,  and  so  cooperation  will  be
15:361:31182:30:30:90:521:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:chosen  so  long  as  (1)(0)(0)mc cEIKπππ≥+−.    As  long  as  monopoly  profits  exceeds  the
15:362:31276:30:27:90:522:301:144:Times:144:Times:B:sum of duopoly profits, this condition holds as long as K is not too negative (i.e., I does
15:363:31367:27:28:90:460:274:144:Times:65:Times:B:not face too heavy a cost disadvantage in commercializing the technology).11
15:364:31443:28:27:126:522:246:144:Times:144:Times:A:In sum, under efficient bargaining, there may be considerable gains from trade as
15:365:31524:27:41:90:522:219:144:Times:144:Times:B:the result of the preservation of monopoly profits and the avoidance of duplicative sunk
15:366:31612:41:12:90:522:178:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
15:367:31756:12:7:90:315:166:99:Times:99:Times:F:technology could be introduced into the product market.
15:368:31811:7:16:90:522:159:42:Times:99:Times:F:10 While it is possible to provide a full characterization of how the nature of bargaining affect the precise
15:369:31920:16:11:90:522:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:“price”  at  which  cooperation  takes  place  (see  Gans  and  Stern  (2000a)),  the  overall  finding  is  that
15:370:32033:11:12:90:522:132:99:Times:99:Times:F:cooperation  takes  place  when  bargaining  is  efficient  and  industry  profits  are  higher  by  the  avoidance  of
15:371:32152:12:7:90:341:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:competition is independent of the specific bargaining protocol.
15:372:32215:7:16:90:521:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:11  It  is  important  to  note  that  cooperation  is  therefore  the  equilibrium  under  the  assumptions  of  the
15:373:32332:16:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:traditional R&D strategic investment literature (Gilbert and Newbery, 1983; Reinganum, 1983; 1989).  In
15:374:32435:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:other  words,  most  prior  theoretical  work  has  simply  assumed  competition  as  an  outcome  rather  than
15:375:32546:12:0:90:373:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:identifying the economic foundations of competition over cooperation.
16:376:32617:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost   investment.      With   this   in   mind,   we   now   incorporate   two   key   bargaining
16:377:32715:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:imperfections  arising  from  “search”  costs  prior  to  bargaining  and  the  potential  for
16:378:32809:27:40:90:254:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:expropriation during negotiations.
16:379:32843:40:32:90:153:614:144:Times:144:Times:B:Search Costs
16:380:32855:32:27:126:522:582:144:Times:144:Times:A:Even if IP rights are well defined, bargaining over “ideas” may involve search and
16:381:32937:27:28:90:522:555:144:Times:144:Times:B:transactional  costs,  c,  borne  by  the  entrant,  which  may  reduce  the  gains  from  pursuing
16:382:33036:28:28:90:521:527:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation.    For  example,  I  and  E  may  disagree  about  the  commercial  value  of  an
16:383:33130:28:27:90:522:499:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation.    Alternatively,  E  may  have  to  incur  substantial  costs  in  locating  and
16:384:33223:27:28:90:522:472:144:Times:144:Times:B:identifying  the  “best”  potential  partner.    In  many  industries,  the  competencies  and  costs
16:385:33324:28:28:90:521:444:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  different  incumbents  may  not  be  observable  and  so  E  may  have  to  exert  effort  in
16:386:33421:28:27:90:241:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:searching for a suitable partner.
16:387:33454:27:28:126:522:389:144:Times:144:Times:A:Since c is  a  sunk  cost,  it  will  not  be  recoverable  during  negotiations  with  I.
16:388:33544:28:27:90:522:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently,  even  if  negotiations  after  search  proceed  “smoothly,”  E  accounts  for  this
16:389:33642:27:28:90:522:334:144:Times:144:Times:B:sunk  cost  (rather  than  the  pure  gains  from  cooperation)  when  choosing  its  optimal
16:390:33735:28:28:90:522:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategy.    If  entry  is  not  credible,  E  receives  0  if  no  agreement  is  reached  while  I
16:391:33835:28:32:90:521:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:continues  to  earn  its  pre-innovation  monopoly  profits.  In  this  case,  E  expects  to  earn
16:392:33934:32:0:99:169:246:247:Symbol:143:Times:A:()(1)( 0 )
16:393:33944:0:43:112:522:253:48:Times:144:Times:A:mmγππ−  through  bargaining  and  so  will  choose  to  cooperate  so  long  as

16:395:34038:0:8:112:452:217:48:Times:48:Times:F:mmc.    On  the  other  hand,  if  entry  is  credible,  E  earns  (0)c
16:396:34109:8:32:448:521:209:48:Times:144:Times:A:EKπ−  under
16:397:34120:32:29:90:522:177:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition  while  I’s  profits  are  equal  to  (0)cIπ.    This  threat  of  competition  affects  the
16:398:34224:29:0:90:522:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:outside  options  of  both  parties  in  bargaining.    Under  Nash  bargaining,  the  equilbrium
17:399:34323:0:28:90:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:alloation to E will simply be equal to the outside option of E plus E’s share of the gains

17:407:34709:39:32:90:234:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:Disclosure and Expropriation
17:408:34737:32:28:126:522:469:144:Times:144:Times:A:Perhaps a more fundamental source of bargaining imperfections in the context of
17:409:34816:28:27:90:522:441:144:Times:144:Times:B:R&D licensing arises from the disclosure problem.  As first articulated by Arrow (1962),
17:410:34904:27:28:90:522:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:the problem with a “market for ideas” is that while the value of an idea to a buyer cannot
17:411:34994:28:27:90:522:386:144:Times:144:Times:B:be  known  without  the  idea  being  disclosed,  disclosure  itself  precludes  the  buyer  from
17:412:35091:27:28:90:522:359:144:Times:144:Times:B:being required to pay for it.  In the context of start-up innovator negotiations with I, when
17:413:35184:28:27:90:521:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:IP  rights  are  weak,  E  realizes  that  by  disclosing  the  nature  of  the  innovation  during
17:414:35283:27:28:90:279:304:144:Times:144:Times:B:negotiations, it risks expropriation by I.
17:415:35325:28:28:126:522:276:144:Times:144:Times:A:However,  as  first  suggested  by  Anton  and  Yao  (1994),  expropriation  may  be
17:416:35409:28:27:90:522:248:144:Times:144:Times:B:partially mitigated by E’s credible threat to compete with I in the product market.   Since
17:417:35500:27:28:90:522:221:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up  innovators  are  able  to  reduce  incumbent  rents  even  in  the  absence  of  IP  rights,
17:418:35602:28:27:90:515:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential entrants may receive rents from cooperating because of their threat to compete.
17:419:35691:27:28:126:522:166:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  incorporate  the  impact  of  expropriation  and  its  interaction  with  potential
17:420:35778:28:40:90:522:138:144:Times:144:Times:B:product  market  competition  by  assuming  that,  when  E  negotiates  with  I, I  acquires  the
17:421:35875:40:8:90:234:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
17:422:35923:8:0:90:419:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:12 See Gans and Stern (2000a) for a detailed derivation of this bargaining solution.
18:423:36009:0:29:90:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation with probability 1-θ.  When copying occurs, I can exploit the innovation with
18:424:36097:29:29:90:521:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:no payment.  This lowers E’s bargaining power since I’s outside option has become more
18:425:36183:29:32:90:522:650:144:Times:144:Times:B:attractive  ((1)(0))ππ>ccII, and because its own outside option has become less attractive
18:426:36273:32:31:91:521:618:144:Times:144:Times:B:((1)    (0))ππ<ccEE.  At the same time, with probability θ, bargaining occurs according to the
18:427:36367:31:27:90:521:587:144:Times:144:Times:B:search  cost  equilibrium  described  above.    Finally,  it  is  important  to  recall  that,  if  E
18:428:36468:27:30:90:521:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:chooses  to  compete  prior  to  bargaining  at  all,  we  assume  that  I cannot  imitate  the
18:429:36563:30:30:90:241:530:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation (i.e., I earns      (0)πcI).
18:430:36602:30:27:126:522:500:144:Times:144:Times:A:E’s  optimal  commercialization  strategy  depends  on  its  expected  outside  options
18:431:36689:27:28:90:522:473:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  depend  on  the  credibility  of  product  market  entry.    Three  distinct  cases  arise,
18:432:36787:28:28:90:521:445:144:Times:144:Times:B:depending  on  whether  entry  is  credible  ex  ante  (prior  to  bargaining  with  I)  or  ex  post
18:433:36888:28:27:90:522:417:144:Times:144:Times:B:(after  bargagining  and  imitation  by  I)  (see  Table  3).    In  the  first  regime,  the  costs  of
18:434:36992:27:30:90:522:390:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization are sufficiently high so that ex ante entry is not credible.  In this case,
18:435:37085:30:30:90:522:360:144:Times:144:Times:B:ex post will also not be credible (i.e., (1)(0)ππ<<ccEEK), and so the only route by which
18:436:37174:30:30:90:521:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:E  can  earn  a  return  on  their  innovation  is  to  incur  the  search  cost  c  in  exchange  for  an
18:437:37280:30:33:90:275:300:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected return of ()(1)( 0 )mmθγ  ππ−.
18:438:37319:33:30:126:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second,  it  is  possible  that  while  ex  ante  entry  is  credible,  ex  post  entry  is  not
18:439:37415:30:29:90:521:237:144:Times:144:Times:B:credible  ((0)(1)ccEEKππ≥>).    In  this  regime,  E  risks  “losing”  its  outside  option  if  it
18:440:37514:29:28:90:521:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:attempts  to  cooperate  with  I but  is  expropriated  (at  which  point  entry  becomes  non-
18:441:37609:28:31:90:522:180:144:Times:144:Times:B:credible).  As such, E’s expected benefits from pursuing a cooperative strategy are equal
18:442:37698:31:34:90:521:149:144:Times:144:Times:B:to ()((1)(0)(1)((0)))θγ ππγ π−+−    −−mccIEKcwhich will be weighed against the benefits
18:443:37785:34:0:90:333:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:from competing in the product market, (0)π−cEK.
19:444:37834:0:30:126:522:707:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally,  if  ex  post  entry  is  credible  ((1)cEKπ≥), E  is  able  to  credibly  reduce  I’s
19:445:37929:30:28:90:522:677:144:Times:144:Times:B:monopoly  rents  under  expropriation.    Thus,  E  will  be  able  to  earn  a  cooperative  return
19:446:38029:28:27:90:522:649:144:Times:144:Times:B:from I even when its innovation has been disclosed (Anton and Yao, 1995).  Of course,
19:447:38114:27:28:90:522:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:as E’s outside option is reduced and the post-disclosure bargaining surplus is smaller, this
19:448:38206:28:32:90:183:594:144:Times:144:Times:B:share is reduced to:

19:452:38311:29:28:126:522:531:144:Times:144:Times:A:In summary, when choosing its commercialization strategy, E will account for its
19:453:38391:28:27:90:522:503:144:Times:144:Times:B:share of the gains from avoiding competition and duplicative investment, while balancing
19:454:38479:27:28:90:522:476:144:Times:144:Times:B:these  benefits  with  the  costs  of  search  and  the  potential  losses  in  bargaining  due  to  the
19:455:38583:28:28:90:522:448:144:Times:144:Times:B:disclosure hazard.  The size of each of these effects depends critically upon the credibility
19:456:38676:28:27:90:522:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:of entry by E, both prior to bargaining as well as after an instance of expropriation (table
19:457:38768:27:40:90:303:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:3 summarizes these equilibrium conditions).
19:458:38811:40:32:90:329:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:Comparative Statics and Hypothesis Formulation
19:459:38857:32:27:126:522:321:144:Times:144:Times:A:This   simple   model   holds   several   potentially   testable   insights   about   the
19:460:38946:27:28:90:522:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:determinants  of  start-up  commercialization  strategy.    First,  strong  intellectual  property
19:461:39044:28:27:90:522:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:rights  provide  protection  for  smaller  firms  against  imitation  and  expropriation  by
19:462:39136:27:28:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbents, hence raising the absolute level of their returns from innovation regardless of
19:463:39227:28:28:90:522:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether  they  choose  to  compete  or  cooperate.    However,  commercialization  strategy
19:464:39318:28:28:90:521:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:depends  on  the  relative  returns  to  competition  versus  cooperation.    In  our  model,  the
19:465:39416:28:29:90:521:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:strength  of  intellectual  property  rights  are  reflected  in  the  levels  of  θ  or  γ,  since  the
19:466:39520:29:27:90:522:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:former  measures  the  probability  that  E  avoids  expropriation  while  the  latter  reflects  the
19:467:39621:27:0:90:522:99:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability  of  I  to  work-around  E’s  property  protection  and  so  reduce  its  bargaining  power
20:468:39722:0:29:90:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Gans and Stern, 2000a).  As either θ or γ rises, the probability of cooperation rises, since
20:469:39815:29:27:90:522:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:stronger intellectual property protection improves E’s ability to negotiate a larger share of
20:470:39908:27:28:90:522:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  surplus  from  cooperation  and  hence  makes  it  worthwhile  to  search  for  incumbent
20:471:40002:28:27:90:522:624:144:Times:144:Times:B:partners.    Thus,  strong  intellectual  property  rights  improve  the  returns  from  cooperation
20:472:40102:27:28:90:521:597:144:Times:144:Times:B:with more established firms at  a  faster  rate  than  the  returns  to  competition.    Second,  as
20:473:40202:28:28:90:522:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  costs  of  searching  for  incumbent  partners  falls,  E  becomes  more  likely  to  pursue  a
20:474:40302:28:27:90:522:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperative path.  This is not surprising.  Nonetheless, it does highlight the importance of
20:475:40394:27:28:90:522:514:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlling  for  differences  in  search  costs  in  any  empirical  analysis.    Finally,  the
20:476:40490:28:28:90:522:486:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative  static  of  commercialization  strategy  with  respect  to  K is  somewhat  subtler.
20:477:40587:28:27:90:522:458:144:Times:144:Times:B:While  decreases  in  the  marginal  value  associated  with  investing  K  will  decrease  the
20:478:40682:27:28:90:522:431:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability  of  competition  among  those  firms  who  successfully  introduce  a  product
20:479:40773:28:27:90:521:403:144:Times:144:Times:B:through  competition  or  cooperation,  increases  in  K also  weaken  the  start-up  innovator’s
20:480:40870:27:28:90:522:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:bargaining position and so increases in K may result simply in non-commercialization of
20:481:40957:28:28:90:522:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  innovation  (i.e.,  the  project  would  be  technically  but  not  economically  feasible).
20:482:41054:28:27:90:522:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:However,  within  our  empirical  work,  we  condition  our  evaluation  on  a  sample  of  firms
20:483:41151:27:28:90:522:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:among  whom  all  have  chosen  to  commercialize  their  innovation:  under  this  sampling
20:484:41243:28:27:90:522:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraint,  the  return  from  cooperation  rises  at  a  slower  rate  than  the  return  from
20:485:41339:27:0:90:234:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition as K gets smaller.
21:486:41371:0:50:90:155:707:197:Times:197:Times:C:IV. Data
21:487:41378:50:32:90:144:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:The Survey
21:488:41388:32:28:126:522:625:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  evaluate  whether  the  simple  model  of  Section  III  helps  explain  start-up
21:489:41473:28:27:90:522:597:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovator   commercialization   strategy,   we   require   project-level   commercialization
21:490:41565:27:28:90:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategy  and  business  environment  data.      To  do  so,  we  developed  and  administered  a
21:491:41662:28:28:90:522:542:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy  to  a  sample  of  start-up  innovators  funded  by  two  distinct
21:492:41757:28:27:90:522:514:144:Times:144:Times:B:sources: the US Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program and private venture
21:493:41842:27:28:90:522:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital.  By dividing the sample between SBIR-funded firms and those funded by venture
21:494:41928:28:27:90:522:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital,  we  are  able  to  incorporate  variation  in  terms  of  the  costs  of  identifying  and
21:495:42028:27:28:90:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:contracting  with  potential  partners  while  preserving  the  ability  to  test  comparative
21:496:42122:28:28:90:522:404:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics about the strength of intellectual property protection or the sunk costs associated
21:497:42216:28:27:90:522:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  commercialization.    As  well,  to  ensure  comparability  across  the  two  samples,  we
21:498:42312:27:28:90:522:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:followed the procedure pursued by Lerner (1999) whereby we first collected a sample of
21:499:42398:28:27:90:522:321:144:Times:144:Times:B:SBIR-funded projects and then developed the venture-backed sample by matching on two
21:500:42482:27:28:90:375:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics: four digit SIC code and the firm sales level.
21:501:42544:28:28:126:522:266:144:Times:144:Times:A:Before  describing  the  summary  statistics  from  the  survey,  it  is  useful  to  first
21:502:42635:28:27:90:522:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:describe  some  of  the  institutional  detail  associated  with  our  two  sources  of  data:  SBIR-
21:503:42736:27:28:90:522:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:funded project and VC-backed entrepreneurial firms.  The SBIR program is administered
21:504:42821:28:27:90:522:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:through the Small Business Association (SBA) and aimed at American firms with 500 or
21:505:42905:27:28:90:522:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:fewer  employees  (USGAO,  1995).    Firms  submit  grant  applications  that  are  peer-
21:506:42994:28:28:90:522:128:144:Times:144:Times:B:reviewed  and  awarded  competitively  according  to  three  legislative  goals:  (a)  to  increase
21:507:43093:28:0:90:522:100:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  rate  of  commercialization  of  innovations  derived  from  Federal  research,  (b)  to
22:508:43188:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:enhance the “competitiveness” of small firms in technology-intensive industries, and (c)
22:509:43276:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  enhance  the  participation  of  small  firms  as  well  as  women  and  minority-owned
22:510:43367:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:businesses  in  the  Federal  contracting  process  (USGAO,  1995).13,14    Overall,  once  the
22:511:43462:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:awards are granted, the SBIR is a very “hands-off” subsidy in that the government neither
22:512:43551:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:takes  over  managerial  control  nor  maintains  an  equity  stake  in  funded  organizations
22:513:43645:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Wallsten, 1998; Lerner, 1999).  As well, because the program is administered through all
22:514:43734:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Federal  agencies  who  conduct  R&D,  the  SBIR  tends  to  fund  small-firm  R&D  projects
22:515:43826:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:across  a  wide  array  of  industries,  particularly  as  compared  to  the  concentrated  nature  of
22:516:43928:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:private  venture  financing  (Gans  and  Stern,  2000b).    However,  to  ensure  comparability
22:517:44023:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:across our two samples, however, we analyze a sample drawn from five high-technology
22:518:44107:27:28:90:393:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:segments that have both SBIR as well as venture-backed firms.
22:519:44168:28:28:126:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:The SBIR program can be contrasted with private venture capital.  In contrast to
22:520:44248:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  grants  provided  by  the  SBIR,  VCs  are  allocated  equity  and  managerial  control  in
22:521:44344:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange for start-up capital.  In addition to their purely financial role, VCs are believed
22:522:44436:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  aid  fledgling  firms  through  providing  superior  management  expertise  to  the  firm  as
22:523:44533:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:well  as  offering  the  VC  firm’s  network  of  contacts  and  experience  in  corporate
22:524:44623:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:governance  (Bygrave  and  Timmons,  1992;  Roberts,  1991).    While  prior  research  has
22:525:44714:28:38:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided only limited direct empirical evidence of these non-investment roles for venture
22:526:44803:38:7:90:234:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
22:527:44851:7:17:90:522:194:42:Times:99:Times:F:13 There are two rounds of potential awards. The maximum phase I award, earmarked for proof of concept
22:528:44953:17:11:90:522:177:99:Times:99:Times:F:and  idea  development,  is  $100,000.  For  the  period  1991-93,  for  all  11  participating  federal  agencies,  the
22:529:45073:11:11:90:522:166:99:Times:99:Times:F:average  ratio  of  funded  Phase  I  proposals  to  proposals  received  was  13.3%  (USGAO,  1995).  Phase  II
22:530:45185:11:12:90:522:155:99:Times:99:Times:F:awards  are  capped  at  $750,000  and  is  a  grant  for  developing  a  technology  and  exploring  its  commercial
22:531:45302:12:7:90:429:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:potential. Only those firms with a Phase I award are considered for a Phase II award.
22:532:45387:7:16:90:522:136:42:Times:99:Times:F:14 The rationale for the program appears to be two-fold. First, small, entrepreneurial firms are thought to be
22:533:45497:16:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:highly productive in generating ideas and technical advances that become the basis for valuable innovations
22:534:45604:12:11:90:522:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:(Acs  and  Audretsch,  1988;  Aghion  and  Tirole,  1994).  Second,  technology  development  in  these  firms  is
22:535:45718:11:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:believed to generate positive externalities (Jaffe, 1986). Left on their own, these firms would likely under-
22:536:45827:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:invest  relative  to  the  socially  optimal  level  due  to  their  inability  to  appropriate  the  full  value  of  their
22:537:45951:12:0:90:191:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:invention (Arrow, 1962).
23:538:45977:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalists,  both  economists  and  organizational  sociologists  have  increasingly  explored
23:539:46072:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:such  effect  in  recent  years  (Stuart,  et  al.  1999;  Gompers  and  Lerner,  1999).    More
23:540:46168:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:generally, while projects funded by the SBIR and VCs will differ in terms of the impact
23:541:46255:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  the  funders  will  have  on  the  operation  and  strategy  of  the  firm,  projects  funded  by
23:542:46358:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:either  source  are  comparable  in  several  respects:    the  projects  are  selectively  chosen,
23:543:46457:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:funded  enterprises  are  often  technology-based,  funded  organizations  tend  to  be  quite
23:544:46551:28:40:90:402:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:young, and the size of financing is comparable (by construction).
23:545:46616:40:31:90:230:503:144:Times:144:Times:B:Data and Summary Statistics
23:546:46643:31:28:126:522:472:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our   data   collection   efforts   took   place   in   two   stages.      First,   we   collected
23:547:46741:28:28:90:522:444:144:Times:144:Times:B:information  from  a  survey  (Appendix  C)  administered  to  a  sample  of  100  SBIR-backed
23:548:46835:28:27:90:522:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:companies between January and March, 1999.  The sample was drawn from the top 200
23:549:46916:27:28:90:522:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:SBIR award winners between 1990 and 1993.  To be included in the sample, firms had to
23:550:47001:28:27:90:522:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:have  successfully  commercialized  an  SBIR-funded  project  into  the  marketplace,  either
23:551:47094:27:28:90:522:334:144:Times:144:Times:B:independently or through partnerships or cooperative agreement.  While this requirement
23:552:47181:28:28:90:522:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:may have induced some degree of selectivity, this criterion was mostly in accord with our
23:553:47270:28:27:90:522:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:sampling  criteria  (i.e.,  most  firms  fit  the  criteria).    We  then  assembled  and  similarly
23:554:47370:27:28:90:522:251:144:Times:144:Times:B:surveyed a sample of VC-funded companies in July, 1999, matched to the SBIR sample,
23:555:47453:28:68:90:445:223:144:Times:65:Times:B:based on four-digit industrial code and each firm’s level of overall sales.15
23:556:47530:68:7:90:234:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
23:557:47578:7:16:90:522:148:42:Times:99:Times:F:15 Companies were matched using a two-step procedure (following Lerner (1999)). First, we searched the
23:558:47680:16:12:90:522:132:99:Times:99:Times:F:Venture  Economics  database  (through  Security  Data  Corporation’s  Platinum  Database)  for  candidate
23:559:47786:12:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:venture-backed companies whose primary line of business matched the four-digit SIC codes for the sample
23:560:47889:12:11:90:522:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:of  SBIR-backed  companies.  We  eliminated  those  companies  that  received  SBIR  funding  (based  on  a
23:561:47996:11:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:database  publicly  available  through  the  SBA  web  site).  Finally,  we  consulted  the  Corptech  Directory of
23:562:48110:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:Technology Companies (1998) to select only those firms within the four-digit SIC code that approximately
23:563:48214:12:0:90:383:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:matched the sales revenue of the SBIR sample, and surveyed those firms.
24:564:48287:0:28:126:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  sample  includes  55  VC-backed  projects  and  86  SBIR-backed  projects,  for  a
24:565:48374:28:27:90:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:total of 141 projects whose primary focus is in one of five SIC codes.16  Two sectors are
24:566:48463:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:drawn  from  projects  at  the  four  digit  SIC  level:  biotechnology  and  pre-packaged
24:567:48553:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:computer software. In addition, three sectors are drawn from projects at the two digit SIC
24:568:48643:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:level:   industrial   machinery   &   equipment,   electronic   &   electrical   equipment,   and
24:569:48740:27:28:90:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:instruments   (including   medical   devices).17      Because   23   observations   are   missing
24:570:48837:28:27:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:information   on   complementary   asset   ratings,   the   final   sample   consists   of   118
24:571:48933:27:28:90:154:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations.
24:572:48946:28:28:126:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:At  the  firm  level,  we  collected  background  information  on  the  organization’s
24:573:49032:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees  and  promotion  policies;  financial  information  about  corporate  ownership,
24:574:49122:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditures  and  revenues;  and  corporate  governance  issues.    On  the  project  level,  each
24:575:49221:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:company  was  asked  to  provide  information  on  the  commercialization  and  financing

24:579:49588:27:28:90:365:295:144:Times:65:Times:B:information about the commercialization strategy itself.18

24:581:49733:27:28:90:522:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent  variable,  COOPERATE,  is  a  dummy  variable  equal  to  1  if  either  the  firm’s
24:582:49828:28:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:revenues  from  the  project  are  the  result  of  licensing  or  intellectual  property  sales

24:584:49972:7:16:90:522:177:42:Times:99:Times:F:16  The  overall  response  rate  to  the  survey  was  approximately  50%.  Firms  contacted  but  not  responding
24:585:50087:16:12:90:522:161:99:Times:99:Times:F:seemed  to  be  randomly  mixed  between  firms  not  having  a  commercial  product  and  those  too  busy  or  not
24:586:50203:12:11:90:522:149:99:Times:99:Times:F:willing to respond. Within the organization, the respondent was typically one of the following individuals:
24:587:50310:11:12:90:522:138:99:Times:99:Times:F:the  director  of  R&D,  the  director  of  sales  or  marketing,  or  the  CEO.  Most  of  the  surveys  (approximately
24:588:50430:12:7:90:434:126:99:Times:99:Times:F:75%) were filled out over the telephone, with the balance either faxed or mailed back.
24:589:50516:7:16:90:522:119:42:Times:99:Times:F:17  Analysis  of  a  similar  data  set  of  55  SBIR-backed  firms  matched  with  55  comparable  VC-backed  firms
24:590:50632:16:0:90:359:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:yield qualitatively the same results as those presented in this paper.

25:592:50797:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise.  Within our sample of 118 projects, over one-third are commercialized through
25:593:50885:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  cooperative  strategy.    However,  as  can  be  seen  in  Figure  B,  there  is  substantial
25:594:50981:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneity  across  sectors  in  terms  of  this  probability  –  while  the  probability  of
25:595:51077:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:cooperation  is  more  than  50%  in  biotechnology,  only  just  over  20%  of  the  projects  are
25:596:51176:27:28:90:427:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialized via a COOPERATE strategy in Industrial Equipment.
25:597:51240:28:28:126:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  main  goal  of  our  empirical  exercise  is  to  relate  COOPERATE  to  variables
25:598:51327:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:proxying  for  the  salience  of  intellectual  property  protection,  the  role  of  sunk  cost
25:599:51423:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:asymmetries,  and  the  costs  of  identifying  and  negotiating  with  potential  partners.    We
25:600:51521:28:27:90:377:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:now review our variables for each of these concepts in turn.
25:601:51581:27:28:126:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:We measure the strength of intellectual property in several different ways across
25:602:51662:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  sample.    In  the  majority  of  our  analysis,  we  focus  on  whether  the  start-up  innovator
25:603:51765:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:has    received    at    least    one    patent    associated    with    the    technology    (PATENT
25:604:51866:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:THRESHOLD).    While  the  mean  number  of  patents  held  by  each  firm  is  a  little  greater
25:605:51964:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:than  six  (PATENTS),  just  less  than  two-thirds  of  the  start-ups  are  associated  with
25:606:52058:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:PATENT  THRESHOLD  =  1.19    In  addition  to  these  “objective”  measures  of  the
25:607:52143:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:association  with  intellectual  property,  we  also  exploit  our  survey  to  measure  the
25:608:52235:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:perceived  strength  of  appropriability  (in  the  spirit  of  Levin  et  al.  (1987)).    Specifically,
25:609:52340:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  asked  each  firm  to  rank  several  different  appropriability  strategies  on  a  five-point
25:610:52439:28:38:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:Likert  scale.    In  this  regard,  we  use  each  firm’s  ranking  of  the  importance  of  patents
25:611:52540:38:8:90:522:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
25:612:52684:8:18:90:522:138:65:Times:99:Times:F:18 Whenever  possible,  we  used  publicly  available  databases  to  verify  information  from  the  survey
25:613:52791:18:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:responders. For example, we verified the number of patents assigned to each organization through both the
25:614:52896:12:11:90:96:108:99:Times:42:Times:F:US Patent and Trademark Office’s web site and the IBM patent database.19
25:615:52968:11:11:96:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:  While  earlier  analyses  have  used  patents  in  a  limited  way  to  evaluate  commercialization  strategy
25:616:53079:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:(Hellman  and  Puri  (1998)),  we  interpret  it  according  to  a  much  more  specific  theory  of  how  intellectual
25:617:53198:12:0:90:340:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:property shapes start-up innovator commercialization strategy.
26:618:53262:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:(PATENT LIKERT) as well as their maximal rating as to the importance of patent, patent
26:619:53348:28:27:90:352:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:litigation threats, or trade secrecy (IP LIKERT MAX).
26:620:53401:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:To   measure   the   relative   investment   costs   that   entrants   face   in   acquiring
26:621:53493:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  assets  needed  to  commercialize  their  innovation,  we  again  relied  on  a
26:622:53587:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:five  point  Likert  scale.    Executives  from  our  sample  companies  were  asked  to  rate  the
26:623:53686:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:importance of control over each of the following in earning returns from their innovation:
26:624:53776:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturing,  distribution  channels,  brand  development,  and  servicing  resources.    We
26:625:53870:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:use  this  set  of  questions  as  a  measure  of  the  feasibility  of  entrants  to  acquire  or  control
26:626:53977:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  assets  necessary  to  exploit  their  invention,  reasoning  that  executives
26:627:54070:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  rate  individual  complementary  assets  as  high  if  he  or  she  believed  the  asset  was
26:628:54170:27:28:90:231:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtainable at reasonable cost.
26:629:54200:28:28:126:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  the  empirical  analysis,  we  use  two  measures  of  investment  costs  to  acquire
26:630:54289:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  assets.  CA  LIKERT  MAX  is  the  maximum  Likert  score  over  a  set  of
26:631:54379:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  assets  necessary  to  commercialize  a  given  innovation,  an  indication  of
26:632:54473:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether any  of  the  assets  were  important  in  earning  returns  from  the  technology-based
26:633:54569:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:project.  Since  complementary  assets  comprise  a  network  of  investment  choices,  all  of
26:634:54664:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:which are important in the ultimate division of profits from innovation between entrants
26:635:54752:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  incumbents  (Teece,  1986),  we  use  a  second  measure  of  complementary  assets.  CA
26:636:54845:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:LOW  is  a  dummy  variable  set  equal  to  one  if  CA  LIKERT  MAX  is  less  than  the
26:637:54935:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximum  possible  value  of  five.  CA  LOW  is  therefore  an  indicator  of  high  relative
26:638:55029:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:investment  cost  for  the  entrant  in  acquiring  the  set  of  assets  necessary  to  commercialize
26:639:55131:28:0:90:446:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:its innovation, a condition satisfied for just less than a third of our sample.
27:640:55212:0:28:126:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:As suggested earlier, we selected our sample so that it was approximately equally
27:641:55293:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:divided between SBIR-funded firms and VC-backed firms, thus allowing us to divide the
27:642:55378:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample  between  firms  who  on  average  would  face  relatively  high  versus  relatively  low
27:643:55474:28:28:90:485:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs in identifying and negotiating cooperative agreements with incumbent firms.
27:644:55555:28:27:126:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:In addition, we include several firm-level and technology-level variables into our
27:645:55637:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis.    To  control  for  differences  across  firms  in  their  resources  and  capabilities,  we
27:646:55740:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:include  a  control  variable  for  the  firm’s  initial  size  (a  little  over  25  employees  on
27:647:55839:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:average)  and  whether  the  founder  of  the  firm  has  remained  the  CEO  (this  latter  effect
27:648:55938:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:captures  the  degree  of  agency  in  the  firm  in  terms  of  the  commercialization  decision).
27:649:56037:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally,  we  respondents  recorded  the  type of  innovation  in  order  to  control  for  both  the
27:650:56138:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation’s quality and the degree to which the innovation would be complementary to
27:651:56223:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  incumbent’s  current  product  set  or  whether  this  was  more  naturally  a  competitive
27:652:56319:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:product  (e.g.,  almost  40%  of  the  innovations  were  recorded  as  “novel  systems”).    With
27:653:56417:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:this   data   overview   in   mind,   we   now   turn   to   our   analysis   of   how   start-up
27:654:56514:28:59:90:427:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization strategy is impacted by the economic environment.

27:656:56600:66:32:90:187:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:Simple Correlations
27:657:56619:32:28:126:522:165:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  analysis  begins  in  Tables  6  and  7  where  we  report  the  simple  “pairwise”
27:658:56707:28:27:90:522:137:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditional  means  relating  the  probability  that  COOP  =  1  to  our  key  variables.    The
27:659:56804:27:28:90:522:110:144:Times:144:Times:B:results are quite striking.  For each of our measures of environmental variation in Table 6,
27:660:56896:28:0:90:522:82:144:Times:144:Times:B:the probability of cooperation is increasing at least 70% as one moves from the lower to
28:661:56986:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher  conditional  mean.    As  well,  Table  7  presents  how  the  probability  of  cooperation
28:662:57085:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:varies  with  PATENT  THRESHOLD  and  CA  LOW.    When  both  of  these  measures  are
28:663:57171:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal  to  zero,  the  probability  of  cooperation  is  less  than  15%;  this  percentage  jumps  to
28:664:57273:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:over 55% when both are equal to one.  In other words, when there are fewer gains from
28:665:57358:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade (the start-up innovator rates control over assets as critical for profitability) and there
28:666:57454:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  no  well-defined  intellectual  property  claims,  then  the  probability  of  cooperation  is
28:667:57553:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:much  smaller  than  when  these  conditions  are  both  reversed.    Of  course,  these  simple
28:668:57649:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlations  are  not  in  any  sense  dispositive,  and  so  we  now  turn  to  a  more  systematic
28:669:57750:27:40:90:385:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression analysis to evaluate the robustness of these results.
28:670:57814:40:32:90:193:448:144:Times:144:Times:B:Regression Estimates
28:671:57834:32:27:126:522:416:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table  8  presents  our  core  regression  results,  each  of  which  is  estimated  using  a
28:672:57927:27:28:90:522:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:binary  probit  model  where  the  dependent  variable  is  the  probability  of  cooperation.      In
28:673:58029:28:27:90:522:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:(8-1) through (8-3) we simply evaluate the pairwise interactions between each of our core
28:674:58118:27:28:90:522:334:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures  and  COOP;  each  is  statistically  significant  and  quantitatively  important.    As
28:675:58215:28:28:90:522:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:well, our results remain robust along each dimension when we include multiple measures
28:676:58301:28:27:90:522:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  the  same  time,  as  we  do  in  (8-4)  through  (8-6).  For  example,  in  our  base  regression
28:677:58403:27:28:90:522:251:144:Times:144:Times:B:model (Equation 8-6), an individual change in the three (indicator) variables at the means
28:678:58493:28:27:90:522:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  other  independent  variables  changes  the  probability  of  cooperation  17.3%  (VC),
28:679:58589:27:28:90:522:196:144:Times:144:Times:B:18.4%  (CA  LOW),  and  23%  (PATENT  THRESHOLD).    In  some  sense,  these  “base”
28:680:58673:28:28:90:522:168:144:Times:144:Times:B:models simply confirm our results from Tables 5 and 6 about the basic relationship in the
28:681:58762:28:27:90:300:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:data between our core variables and COOP.
28:682:58803:27:28:126:522:113:144:Times:144:Times:A:The statistical significance of CA LOW and PATENT THRESHOLD is robust to
28:683:58875:28:0:90:522:85:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of a variety of control variables, a result demonstrated in Table 9.  In this set of
29:684:58971:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:regressions,  however,  the  significance  of  VC  is  weakened,  with  p-values  ranging  from
29:685:59066:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:11-18%.      For  example,  our  results  are  robust  (except  for  the  significance  of  the  VC
29:686:59165:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient)  to  a  regression  that  includes  BASELINE  EMPLOYEES  as  a  control  for  the
29:687:59259:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:size of the organization at the start of the project.  As well, this regression suggests that
29:688:59352:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller  organizations  are  more  likely  to  choose  to  cooperate,  perhaps  in  part  due  to
29:689:59449:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital constraints.  In addition, (9-2) includes the CEO FOUNDER variable as a control
29:690:59536:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:for possible “founder” effects.  There is evidence that firms headed by their founders may
29:691:59626:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionately  prefer  to  retain  corporate  control  over  the  commercialization  process
29:692:59723:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:of their technology, even if it means (ex-post)  less  profits  (Roberts,  1991).    Finally,  and
29:693:59821:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:perhaps  most  importantly,  (9-3)  suggests  that  both  our  findings  for  intellectual  property
29:694:59921:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  the  role  of  sunk  assets  is  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  “industry”  effects  (for
29:695:60016:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:biotechnology  and  electronics),  suggesting  that  we  are  identified  both  off  the  cross-
29:696:60112:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry  and  within-industry  variation  in  our  key  measures.    As  well,  notice  that
29:697:60205:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:biotechnology  firms  in  our  sample  are  more  likely  to  adopt  a  cooperator  strategy  in
29:698:60301:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercializing  their  innovations,  a  result  which  is  consistent  with  industry-level
29:699:60393:27:28:90:134:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyses.
29:700:60402:28:28:126:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  interpret  these  results  as  providing  support  for  a  model  in  which  an  ideas
29:701:60492:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:market  is  enabled  when  a  firm’s  business  environment  offers  a  strong  intellectual
29:702:60584:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:property  regime  at  the  same  time  that  entrant  firms  face  high  relative  costs  in  acquiring
29:703:60687:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  controlling  key  complementary  assets  necessary  for  commercialization  success.    In
29:704:60782:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic  environments  such  as  those  often  observed  in  the  biotechnology  industry,
29:705:60873:28:28:90:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:where  patents  are  relatively  effective  in  protecting  intellectual  property  (Levin,  et  al.,
29:706:60974:28:0:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:1987)  and  firms  face  high  relative  investment  costs  (USOTA,  1984),  firms  tend  to  earn
30:707:61074:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:their returns from innovation through the ideas market, acting as an upstream supplier of
30:708:61163:28:27:90:437:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:“technology” rather than as a horizontal innovation-oriented competitor.
30:709:61235:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  contrast,  when  investment  costs  for  the  entrant  are  relatively  low  and  the
30:710:61324:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:technological  innovation  is  not  protected  by  patents,  as  in  our  stylized  example  of  the
30:711:61424:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:disk  drive  industry,  we  predict  that  the  severe  disclosure  threat  along  with  the  relative
30:712:61526:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:high  level  of  incompatibility  between  “generations”  of  technology  forecloses  the  ideas
30:713:61622:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:market for entrants, who instead commercialize their innovations through product market
30:714:61709:28:39:90:501:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition; it is this market failure which then spurs the gale of creative destruction.

30:716:61844:32:27:126:522:444:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Table 10, we explore the robustness of our core results to different measures of
30:717:61927:27:28:90:522:417:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary assets and intellectual property protection.  In (10-1) through (10-3), we
30:718:62015:28:28:90:522:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:experiment  with  alternative  measures  of  strength  in  the  intellectual  property  regime.

30:720:62191:27:28:90:522:334:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant  and  quantitatively  important.    While  both  PATENT  THRESHOLD  and
30:721:62274:28:28:90:522:306:144:Times:144:Times:B:PATENT   LIKERT   each   have   their   own   interpretational   problems   (e.g.,   PATENT
30:722:62365:28:27:90:522:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:THRESHOLD might be proxying for quality while it is difficult to ensure comparability
30:723:62450:27:28:90:522:251:144:Times:144:Times:B:from  survey  responses  of  this  type),  the  robust  relationship  between  each  and  COOP
30:724:62544:28:68:90:522:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides limited supporting evidence for one of our key hypotheses: stronger intellectual

30:726:62681:7:16:90:522:148:42:Times:99:Times:F:20  In  addition  to  the  tables  reviewed  in  this  section,  Appendix  A  presents  a  single  regression  which
30:727:62797:16:12:90:522:132:99:Times:99:Times:F:simultaneously  includes  all  of  the  control  regressors  discussed  in  this  section,  as  well  as  several  other
30:728:62917:12:12:90:522:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:variables  which  we  experimented  with  extensively  (and  consistently  found  robustness  to).    Specifically,
30:729:63032:12:11:90:522:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:Appendix  A  includes  controls  for  initial  firm  size,  industrial  sector,  whether  the  CEO  is  the  founder,  the
30:730:63154:11:11:90:522:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:“type” of innovation, the composition of the firm’s workforce in terms of the share of employees who have
30:731:63259:11:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:technical  training  or  hold  a  PhD,  the  length  of  development  and  the  year  of  commercialization,  the
30:732:63372:12:0:90:402:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:customer type, and the manufacturing process associated with the technology.
31:733:63450:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:property  protection  is  associated  with  higher  rather  than  lower  levels  of  cooperation
31:734:63546:28:27:90:341:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:between incumbents and start-up innovator entrants.
31:735:63597:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:These  core  results  are  also  robust  to  an  alternate  measure  of  the  complementary
31:736:63688:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:asset  regime.  CA  LIKERT  MAX,  the  maximum  over  the  set  of  survey-collected  Likert
31:737:63780:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures  of  the  importance  of  complementary  assets  in  earning  returns  from  the  firm’s
31:738:63877:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovation,  is  also  significant.21    Indeed,  (10-5)  shows  that  this  variable  is  robust  to
31:739:63978:28:27:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry  and  firm  size  effects.  CA  LIKERT  MAX  indicates  that  if  any  of  the  set  of
31:740:64074:27:28:90:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  assets  is  relatively  costly  for  the  entrant  to  acquire,  the  entrant  is  more
31:741:64176:28:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely  to  take  a  cooperative  strategy,  a  result  consistent  with  our  preferred  measure  of
31:742:64277:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary  asset,  CA  LOW.22  In  addition,  as  previously  mentioned,  access  to  a
31:743:64368:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:network of assets is often necessary for commercial success.  Therefore, a better measure
31:744:64457:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the complementary asset regime is the maximum value over the set of Likert ratings, a
31:745:64545:28:27:90:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure  of  whether  any  complementary  assets  are  important  in  earning  returns  from
31:746:64637:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercializing  an  invention,  and  indeed,  CA  LIKERT  MAX  is  significant  in  equation
31:747:64730:28:27:90:111:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:B-1.
31:748:64734:27:28:126:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  contrast  to  the  systematic  and  robust  results  associated  with  intellectual
31:749:64821:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:property  and  sunk  assets,  our  measure  of  search  costs  for  alliance  opportunities  for
31:750:64917:28:27:90:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:entrants, VC,  shows  only  weak  robustness  across  different  specifications,  with  p-values
31:751:65013:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:ranging between 5% and 12.9% across different tables.  The weakness of this result may
31:752:65099:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:be  an  artifact  of  using  the  presence  of  venture  capital  financing  as  a  measure  of  search
31:753:65202:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs incurred by start-ups in locating and striking a deal with interested product market
31:754:65292:28:7:90:234:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
31:755:65340:7:16:90:522:122:42:Times:99:Times:F:21  Recall  that  we  interpret  high  ratings  of  the  complementary  asset  variable  as  an  indication  that  the
31:756:65458:16:0:90:339:106:99:Times:99:Times:F:manager believes the asset is attainable at a “reasonable” cost.
32:757:65524:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:incumbents.  Due to heterogeneity in the information intermediation role among venture
32:758:65610:28:27:90:339:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:financiers, our measure of search costs is imperfect.
32:759:65663:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally,  in  Table  11,  we  show  that  not  only  are  our  core  results  robust  to  the
32:760:65756:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of product characteristics, but these same features which are supposed to have
32:761:65844:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanatory  power  in  the  context  of  alternative  models  do  not  seem  to  have  an  effect  in
32:762:65946:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:the data.  Of course, we do not overemphasize such results as the type of innovation are
32:763:66034:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:self-reported by the organization.  That said, our results concerning the principal elements
32:764:66126:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  our  theory  (CA  LOW,  PATENT  THRESHOLD,  and  VC)  are  indeed  robust  to  the
32:765:66212:27:60:90:306:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of such technology-type indicators.
32:766:66257:60:38:90:198:428:197:Times:197:Times:C:VI. Conclusions
32:767:66271:38:27:126:522:390:144:Times:144:Times:A:Motivated  by  the  substantial  differences  observed  in  start-up  commercialization
32:768:66358:27:28:90:522:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategies  across  different  high-technology  sectors,  this  paper  developed  and  tested  a
32:769:66454:28:28:90:522:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:simple economic model identifying conditions under which start-up innovators earn their
32:770:66541:28:27:90:522:307:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns on innovation through product market cooperation with more established firms as
32:771:66628:27:28:90:522:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:opposed  to  competition  with  incumbents.    The  innovator’s  commercialization  strategy
32:772:66720:28:27:90:522:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:choice  weighs  the  competing  benefits  and  costs  of  cooperation.    While  a  cooperative
32:773:66815:27:28:90:522:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategy  forestalls  the  costs  of  competition  in  the  product  market  and
32:774:66914:28:28:90:522:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:avoids duplicative investment in sunk assets, imperfections in the “market for ideas” may
32:775:67003:28:27:90:522:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:lead   innovators   to   instead   pursue   a   competitive   strategy   in   the   product   market.
32:776:67104:27:33:90:522:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically,  if  the  transaction  costs  of  bargaining  with  incumbents  are  high  or  if  the
32:777:67204:33:7:90:522:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                
32:778:67348:7:16:90:522:102:42:Times:99:Times:F:22  As  well,  Appendix  B  shows  that  “individual”  Likert  ratings  of  the  complementary  asset  regime  are  not
32:779:67467:16:12:90:522:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:significant.  This result should not be surprising, as the importance of particular complementary assets for
32:780:67575:12:0:90:326:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:commercialization success vary (at least) across industries.
33:781:67637:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovator   faces   expropriation   in   the   context   of   bargaining,   then   product   market
33:782:67736:28:27:90:219:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition is more likely.
33:783:67763:27:28:126:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:A:We    tested    these    hypotheses    using    a    novel    sample    of    the    start-up
33:784:67856:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercialization  strategies  of  118  companies.    Overall,  our  empirical  results  provide
33:785:67952:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence  for  the  three  main  hypotheses  associated  with  our  theory.    Perhaps  most
33:786:68044:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:strikingly,  firms  who  control  intellectual  property  or  are  associated  with  venture  capital
33:787:68145:28:28:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:financing are more likely to pursue a cooperative strategy.  These results suggest that the
33:788:68236:28:27:90:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:role of intellectual property or venture capital on the competitiveness of product markets
33:789:68326:27:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  somewhat  more  nuanced  than  assumed  in  many  theoretical  treatments.    For  example,
33:790:68421:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:while  most  prior  work  has  emphasized  the  fact  that  strong  intellectual  property  position
33:791:68521:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases  the  absolute  returns  to  innovation,  our  evidence  is  consistent  with  a  slightly
33:792:68621:28:28:90:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:more  refined  position  –  increases  in  the  strength  of  intellectual  property  increase  the
33:793:68720:28:27:90:406:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative returns to cooperation by facilitating the market for ideas.
33:794:68789:27:28:126:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:Similarly,  while  most  analyses  simply  assume  that  technology-oriented  venture
33:795:68874:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:financing systematically spurs the “gale of creative destruction,” our results are consistent
33:796:68967:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  an  alternative  perspective.    Specifically,  while  venture  financing  is  certainly
33:797:69061:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with certain “instances” of creative destruction, the focus by venture capitalists
33:798:69154:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  profit  maximization  and  their  ability  to  reduce  the  costs  of  identifying  potential
33:799:69251:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:partners  increases  the  relative  attractiveness  of  cooperation  with  more  established  firms
33:800:69350:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  average.    More  generally,  our  results  suggest  that  the  pro-competitive  benefits  from
33:801:69449:27:28:90:456:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up innovation reflect an earlier market failure – in the market for ideas.
33:802:69529:28:28:126:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  findings  suggest  several  directions  for  future  research  on  how  the  strategic
33:803:69620:28:0:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction  between  entrants  and  incumbents  is  mediated  by  the  viability  of  the  ideas
34:804:69719:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:market.    First,  we  plan  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  the  incentives  associated  with
34:805:69817:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternative  commercialization  strategies  by  both  entrants  and  incumbents  in  “mixed”
34:806:69909:27:28:90:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic  environments.    For  example,  in  environments  where  intellectual  property  is
34:807:70002:28:28:90:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:weak and a dominant incumbent would prefer to take advantage of the R&D productivity
34:808:70086:28:27:90:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of smaller firms, it is possible that there exists a motive to develop a reputation for “non-
34:809:70179:27:28:90:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:expropriation”  in  order  to  provide  incentives  for  innovation  and  cooperation  with  more
34:810:70276:28:27:90:182:543:144:Times:65:Times:B:established firms.23
34:811:70296:27:28:126:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, we would like to evaluate the purely informational role played by venture
34:812:70377:28:28:90:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitalists.    Specifically,  after  controlling  for  the  ability  of  venture  capitalists  to  simply
34:813:70483:28:27:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:identify  “high-quality”  projects,  does  association  with  a  venture  capitalist  with  greater
34:814:70582:27:28:90:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:access  to  potential  partners  (e.g.,  through  participation  on  boards  of  directors)  increase
34:815:70683:28:28:90:481:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the performance and affect the commercialization strategy of start-up innovators?
34:816:70764:28:27:126:522:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally,  it  is  important  to  recall  that  our  data  is  composed  of  a  sample  of
34:817:70853:27:28:90:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:technologically  successful  start-up  firms  who  made  their  initial  investments  during  the
34:818:70950:28:27:90:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:first  half  of  the  1990s.    In  some  sense,  then,  these  firms  are  representative  of  a  wave  of
34:819:71057:27:28:90:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:start-up  investment  that  began  during  that  time  and  has  continued  for  at  least  a  decade.
34:820:71159:28:28:90:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:As  well,  these  firms  chose  their  commercialization  strategy  in  response  to  a  changing
34:821:71256:28:27:90:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:environment  that  has  tended  to  reinforce  the  strength  of  intellectual  property  and  apply
34:822:71356:27:28:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:intellectual  property  protection  in  areas  that  once  were  poorly  served.    While  earlier
34:823:71454:28:27:90:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:research  has  focused  on  the  possibility  that  these  two  trends  (venture  financing  and
34:824:71550:27:28:90:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases  in  the  strength  of  intellectual  property)  may  be  associated  with  an  increase  in
34:825:71652:28:28:90:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  economy  wide  rate  of  innovation  or  R&D  productivity  (Kortum  and  Lerner,  1999),
34:826:71746:28:27:90:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:our  results  suggest  that  these  institutional  and  environmental  changes  may  also  be
34:827:71839:27:7:90:234:74:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                
34:828:71887:7:0:90:515:67:42:Times:99:Times:F:23 Indeed, there is some evidence for such behavior by Intel in the microprocessor industry (Gawer, 2000).
35:829:71995:0:28:90:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated  with  a  shift  in  the  nature  of  strategic  interaction  between  start-up  innovators
35:830:72097:28:27:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  established  firms  –  from  innovation  competition  to  cooperation  in  the  market  for
35:831:72193:27:0:90:118:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:ideas.
