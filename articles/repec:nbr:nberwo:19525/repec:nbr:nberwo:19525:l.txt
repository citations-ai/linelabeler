2:32:1612:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Online contract labor globalizes traditionally local labor markets, with platforms that enable employers,
2:33:1717:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:most of whom are in high-income countries, to more easily outsource tasks to contractors, primarily
2:34:1816:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:located in low-income countries. This market is growing rapidly; we provide descriptive statistics
2:35:1914:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:from one of the leading platforms where the number of hours worked increased 55% from 2011 to
2:36:2007:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:2012, with the 2012 total wage bill just over $360 million. We outline three lines of inquiry in this
2:37:2108:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:market setting that are central to the broader digitization research agenda: 1) How will the digitization
2:38:2213:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of this market influence the distribution of economic activity (geographic distribution of work, income
2:39:2316:14:14:72:539:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:distribution, distribution of work across firm boundaries)?; 2) What is the magnitude and nature
2:40:2402:14:14:72:538:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of information frictions in these digital market settings as reflected by user responses to market
2:41:2486:14:14:72:539:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:design features (allocation of visibility, investments in human capital acquisition, machine-aided
2:42:2580:14:14:72:538:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:recommendations)?; 3) How will the digitization of this market affect social welfare (increased
2:43:2663:14:14:72:539:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:efficiency in matching, production?)? We draw upon economic theory as well as evidence from
2:44:2743:14:14:71:538:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:empirical research on online contract labor markets and other related settings to motivate and
2:45:2824:14:42:72:239:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:contextualize this research agenda.

3:74:3401:0:30:72:184:710:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:75:3416:30:20:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We motivate this chapter on the digitization of the market for contract labor with three observations. First,
3:76:3525:20:20:72:540:660:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this market is growing rapidly in terms of the number and variety of participants and transactions. Second,
3:77:3632:20:20:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in contrast to the highly localized exchange of services typical in the traditional o-ine market for contract
3:78:3741:20:20:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work, the online market is dominated by long distance North-South (as de\fned below) trade. Third, the
3:79:3843:20:20:72:540:600:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:online platforms that facilitate trade in this market introduce seemingly small informational frictions that
3:80:3951:20:20:72:454:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have signi\fcant e-ects on outcomes. We describe each of these market features in turn.
3:81:4038:20:20:86:539:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The growth of online markets for contract labor has been fast and steady. According toHorton(2010),
3:82:4137:20:20:71:539:540:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:workers in this market earned about $700 million by 2009, and theFinancial Times(2012) estimated this
3:83:4238:20:20:71:539:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market to be worth $1 billion annually by the end of 2012. Additional details from oDesk, the largest online
3:84:4346:20:20:71:539:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:marketplace for contract labor in terms of earnings, provide further insight into the growth of this market.
3:85:4454:20:19:71:539:480:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The number of employers billing on the site per quarter increased by over 800% between 2009 and 2013
3:86:4554:19:20:71:539:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(Figure 1), and the number of working contractors per quarter increased by approximately 1,000% over the
3:87:4658:20:20:71:539:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:same period (Figure 3). In pecuniary terms, the quarterly wage bill on oDesk increased by approximately
3:88:4761:20:20:71:464:421:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:900%, from $10,000,000 to almost $100,000,000 over the same four-year period (Figure 2).
3:89:4849:20:20:86:539:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:North-South exchange dominates the pattern of trade in these markets (e.g., relative to North-North,
3:90:4949:20:20:71:539:381:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:B:South-South, and South-North). In other words, employers are predominantly from high-income countries1
3:91:5051:20:20:72:540:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and contractors are mainly from lower-income countries. We classify countries as \high-income" using the
3:92:5155:20:20:72:540:341:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2012 World Bank list of high-income countries. We classify the remaining countries as \lower-income." In
3:93:5259:20:20:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1 we illustrate that not only are there more employers on oDesk from high- compared to lower-income
3:94:5365:20:20:72:540:301:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:countries, but the number from high-income countries is also growing at a faster rate. Similarly, the wage bill
3:95:5476:20:20:72:540:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per quarter is signi\fcantly greater and growing faster for employers from high- versus lower-income countries
3:96:5586:20:20:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(Figure 2). While the contrast is not quite as extreme on the contractor side of the market (a signi\fcant
3:97:5692:20:20:72:540:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:number of contractors are from high-income countries), there were approximately three times as many lower
3:98:5797:20:20:72:540:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:versus high-income contractors in 2009 and that di-erence increased to \fve times by 2013 (Figure 3). This
3:99:5903:20:19:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:does not simply re\rect a growing volume of small jobs performed by contractors from lower-income countries.
3:100:6011:19:20:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 4 we illustrate that the wage bill re\rects a similar pattern in terms of contractors from high- versus
3:101:6124:20:20:72:174:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lower-income countries.
3:102:6147:20:15:86:539:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A number of studies examine how seemingly small information frictions may signi\fcantly in\ruence match-

4:105:6383:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ing outcomesin online markets for contract labor. Perhaps the most dramatic \fnding is the one reported by
4:106:6489:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Pallais(2012). In this study, Pallais conducts a \feld experiment where she \treats" 952 randomly selected
4:107:6595:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contractors by hiring them and then providing feedback on their performance. Then she compares the subse-
4:108:6700:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quent employment performance of these treated contractors with a set of 2,815 other contractors (\controls")
4:109:6808:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who applied for her posted jobs but whom she did not hire and therefore did not post information on. She
4:110:6912:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reports that, for those with no prior work experience on oDesk, the subsequent income of treated contractors
4:111:7020:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:almost triples relative to the income of control contractors over the following two-month period. She then
4:112:7126:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:takes a number of steps to provide further evidence that the observed increase in employment performance
4:113:7230:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is due to the information she posted to the platform about the contractor (i.e., rating and feedback), rather
4:114:7339:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:than due to other explanations such as human capital accumulation by the contractor due to the experience
4:115:7444:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of doing the job. The reason this result is so dramatic is because the treatment is so small: the job is only

4:119:7877:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:completion is not statistically distinct from zero. In other words, the trebling of income is caused by mini-
4:120:7986:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mal information provided by the employer based on a remarkably small job. Although the observed e-ect
4:121:8087:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is based on low-wage data-entry specialists who propose wages of $3 per hour or less, the e-ect of such a
4:122:8192:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seemingly small amount of information is striking. It points to an important market friction present in this
4:123:8300:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:online setting. The author draws a welfare implication from her \fnding: \Under plausible assumptions, the

4:126:8534:20:20:86:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Similar information frictions are reported in other studies in this market setting.Stanton and Thomas

4:128:8736:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:inexperienced contractors a-liated with an intermediary have substantially higher job-\fnding probabilities

4:130:8946:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the relative role of information about experience on oDesk for contractors from high- versus low income
4:131:9049:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:countries.  They \fnd that information about platform-based work experience disproportionately bene\fts
4:132:9152:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contractors from low-income countries (approximately 40% premium). In a related study,Mill(2011) \fnds
4:133:9254:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that once an employer on Freelancer has a good experience with a contractor from a particular country,
4:134:9356:20:20:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:then the employer is more likely to hire someone else from that country. Also related,Ghani et al.(2012)
4:135:9460:20:0:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:report that members of the Indian diaspora hiring on oDesk are more likely to hire workers in India than are
5:136:9569:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:other employers. Finally,Horton(2012) \fnds that recommendations increase the likelihood of a hire in job
5:137:9674:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:categories with fewer quali\fed candidates. In each of these cases, seemingly small amounts of information
5:138:9780:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have signi\fcant e-ects on employment outcomes, suggesting that information frictions play an important
5:139:9883:20:20:72:227:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:role in the matching process online.
5:140:9919:20:20:86:544:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:With these three market features in mind - rapid growth, North-South trade, and sensitivity to information-
5:141:10026:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:based frictions - we turn to analyzing the basic economics of online markets for contract labor in Section 2.
5:142:10135:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In doing so, we consider the characteristics of both the demand and supply sides, stressing the incentives
5:143:10241:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that lead employers as well as contractors to utilize this channel. The main trade-o- that we consider is
5:144:10346:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between the reduction in search, communication, monitoring, and transportation costs on the one hand and
5:145:10450:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the potential for new sources of information-related frictions to arise on the other. We then describe the
5:146:10556:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:role that online contract labor platforms play in facilitating matches between demand and supply and in
5:147:10659:20:20:72:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:addressing some of these trade-o-s. Again, we use evidence from oDesk to provide an in-depth illustration.
5:148:10765:20:20:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Drawing on these insights regarding the basic economic properties of online markets for contract labor,
5:149:10868:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we outline a research agenda predicated on three lines of inquiry. These include: 1) distributional e-ects, 2)
5:150:10978:19:20:72:320:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market design, and 3) welfare. We describe each in turn.
5:151:11034:20:20:86:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In Section 3, we ask: How will the digitization of this market in\ruence the distribution of economic
5:152:11135:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:activity? We consider distribution along three dimensions. First, we contemplate the distribution of work
5:153:11240:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:across geographies.  Will digitization shift the distribution of contract work towards lower-income coun-
5:154:11345:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tries? Second, we question the distribution of income within and across countries. Will digitization further
5:155:11453:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:accentuate income inequality by amplifying superstar-type distributions whereby only a small fraction of
5:156:11557:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contractors capture a large fraction of rents (although some of these individuals may be in lower-income
5:157:11661:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:countries)? Finally, we raise the question of outsourcing. Will digitization lead to a shift in the distribution
5:158:11773:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of work across \frm boundaries, constricting the boundary of the \frm due to a lowering cost of contracting
5:159:11880:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:out discrete jobs? The answers to these lines of inquiry regarding distribution-related e-ects of digitization
5:160:11990:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:will have important implications for understanding the e-ect of digitization on the overall organization of
5:161:12097:20:20:72:270:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work and thus implications for social welfare.
5:162:12143:20:20:86:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Next, in Section 4, we raise this question: How might market design features in\ruence matching in the
5:163:12245:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:digital setting? We describe above the impact of ratings and feedback, a market design feature common
5:164:12346:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:across most platforms. In the digital setting, platforms can add or change market features at reasonably low
5:165:12454:20:20:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cost. However, the ease with which they can be added, deleted, or changed belies the in\ruence they may
5:166:12557:20:0:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have on matching outcomes. While contracting platforms employ many interesting market design features,
6:167:12660:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wefocus our discussion on \fve: 1) performance feedback (e.g., ratings), 2) machine-aided recommendations
6:168:12765:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(for employers and contractors), 3) the allocation of visibility, 4) pricing to reduce congestion, and 5) job
6:169:12874:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:category speci\fcation. Although platforms in the online contract labor market do not have the match-setting
6:170:12982:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:power that is typically analyzed in the market design literature (i.e., directly matching trading partners in
6:171:13091:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:settings such as kidney exchanges and medical student-hospital matching), they do in\ruence which matches
6:172:13196:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are ultimately formed and under what terms. Thus, as market design features evolve, so will the types of
6:173:13300:20:20:72:174:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matches they facilitate.
6:174:13324:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, in Section 5, we ask: How will the digitization of this market a-ect social welfare? In particular,
6:175:13432:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we specify two channels through which digitization may generate e-ciency gains: 1) better matching, and 2)
6:176:13538:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:better production. With regards to matching, the shift from local to global search along with the utilization
6:177:13647:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of market design features enabled by the digitization of relevant information may lead to e-ciency gains.
6:178:13752:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:With regards to production, a reduction in coordination costs that enables more \rexibility in terms of the
6:179:13859:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:location and timing (asynchronous) of work as well as a \fner division of labor due to the feasibility of
6:180:13964:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contracting out smaller jobs, which enables more specialization, may lead to e-ciency gains. At the same
6:181:14068:19:20:72:372:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:time, however, new frictions may lead to new forms of welfare losses.
6:182:14137:20:20:86:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We conclude by outlining three primary challenges to this research agenda. First, o-ine data for this
6:183:14238:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sector is costly to obtain but is required to estimate the causal e-ect of digitization on changes in distribu-
6:184:14349:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tional properties (geography, income, \frm boundaries) and welfare e-ects. Second, the economic salience of
6:185:14456:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:particular market design features may be \reeting since the market is evolving quickly and subject to rapid
6:186:14563:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:technological change. Finally, data ownership is concentrated among a few platforms that seem interested in
6:187:14670:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:engaging with the research community but have interests that are not fully aligned. Despite these challenges,
6:188:14779:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this research agenda identi\fes opportunities to shed light on questions that are of \frst-order importance from
6:189:14891:20:45:72:303:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both a scholarly and economic relevancy perspective.
6:190:14943:45:30:72:433:226:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2  The economics of online contract labor markets
6:191:14992:30:20:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Like other digitized markets, the most salient features of online labor markets are the potential for a large
6:192:15101:20:19:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:number of transactions and services to be provided by suppliers who may be geographically distant from
6:193:15203:19:20:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:buyers. What are the implications for the demand and supply of services in this context? Who supplies labor
6:194:15310:20:20:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:online? What entities search for online services, and what are the trade-o-s they face? What institutions
6:195:15415:20:0:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contribute to clearing these markets? To address these questions, we begin by discussing how oDesk works.
7:196:15521:0:38:72:513:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This willframe the ensuing discussion on labor supply, labor demand, and market-making platforms.
7:197:15618:38:26:72:242:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.1  Work Process on oDesk
7:198:15644:26:20:72:540:646:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:To post jobs on oDesk, employers have to register on the site by giving their contact details and information
7:199:15753:20:20:72:540:626:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on their company, including name, owner, and location. Once registered, employers are free to post as many
7:200:15859:20:20:72:540:606:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jobs as they like. Job postings include a description of the task, the location of the employer, and the type of
7:201:15971:20:20:72:540:586:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contract being o-ered. oDesk supports two contract types|hourly wage and \fxed price. Beyond the di-erent
7:202:16076:20:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:payment structures, the contracts have di-erent implications for monitoring and duration speci\fcations.
7:203:16180:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Speci\fcally, when posting an hourly-wage job, employers have to specify the expected number of hours per
7:204:16285:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:week and the number of weeks required to complete the job. They stipulate a limit on the number of hours
7:205:16389:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per week a contractor can work. When posting a \fxed-price job, employers have to specify the budget and
7:206:16493:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:deadline. Employers can make job postings public (so that any contractor can apply to them) or private (so
7:207:16599:20:20:72:304:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that only contractors they invite can apply to them).
7:208:16652:20:20:86:539:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To be hired on oDesk, workers similarly must register on the site by giving their contact details, name,
7:209:16756:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and location as well as by setting up a pro\fle page. Pro\fle pages are meant to advertise contractors to
7:210:16861:20:20:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:potential employers and can include a description of skills, education, work experience outside of oDesk,
7:211:16966:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oDesk-administered test scores, certi\fcations, whether or not they belong to an agency, and oDesk-speci\fc
7:212:17073:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work histories and feedback scores. Once they have set up their pro\fle pages, contractors can apply to jobs
7:213:17181:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by submitting cover letters and bids to job postings. A bid indicates the amount a contractor is willing to
7:214:17288:20:20:72:183:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be paid to work on a job.
7:215:17313:20:20:86:539:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Employers have the option to interview and negotiate over bids with applicants before hiring and to hire
7:216:17417:20:20:72:540:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as many contractors as they like. Once hired, contractors complete tasks remotely. Contractors submit their
7:217:17524:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work to employers online and are paid via oDesk. Employers have the option to give contractors bonuses
7:218:17626:20:20:72:283:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and can also reimburse expenses through oDesk.
7:219:17672:20:19:86:539:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:After each job, employers give contractors a rating out of \fve based on six criteria:  skills, quality,
7:220:17776:19:20:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:availability, deadlines, communication, and cooperation. Each contractor also has an overall feedback score,
7:221:17884:20:20:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which is a job-size-weighted average of the individual scores.  Contractors can provide their employers
7:222:17987:20:20:72:540:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:feedback scores based on the same criteria; employers have a similarly constructed overall score.  oDesk
7:223:18091:20:20:72:419:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:provides this service in exchange for 10% of every transaction made on the site.
7:224:18171:20:20:86:539:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to oDesk, Elance, Freelancer, and Guru are among the largest online contract labor markets.
7:225:18274:20:0:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Elance and Guru were both launched in 1999, followed by oDesk in 2005 and Freelancer in 2009. These sites
8:226:18380:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are similarin that they allow employers to \fnd and hire short-term workers by registering on the platform
8:227:18486:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and posting jobs to attract applicants. Similarly, they all allow registered contract workers from around the
8:228:18595:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:world to apply for jobs posted on the sites by bidding on them and to advertise themselves to employers
8:229:18698:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with pro\fle pages. These platforms earn revenue by charging a percentage of each transaction or member
8:230:18801:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fees to workers and, in some cases, both. In addition to providing a (virtual) place for demand and supply
8:231:18907:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to meet and for the market to clear, these platforms have evolved over time toward addressing some of the
8:232:19012:20:20:72:427:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:key challenges of labor markets in general and online labor markets in particular.
8:233:19094:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:While the other major platforms in the industry share several features with oDesk, they di-er on cer-
8:234:19195:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tain dimensions. The primary variations lie in the services they provide participants. For instance, some
8:235:19300:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:support contractor employment agencies while others do not, some o-er guaranteed payment for hourly
8:236:19399:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage contracts while others do not, and at least one of the major platforms does not have a virtual o-ce
8:237:19503:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:application. Perhaps the most signi\fcant di-erence concerns Freelancer, which supports both traditional
8:238:19607:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:hiring and crowdsourcing. Given that crowdsourcing has di-erent implications for matching and production,
8:239:19712:20:37:72:490:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\fndings from research based on traditional hiring may not generalize to crowdsourcing settings.
8:240:19808:37:26:72:180:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.2  Labor supply
8:241:19825:26:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:What are the incentives for individuals to supply labor online? One of the most important bene\fts to having
8:242:19933:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:access to online contract labor markets, especially for individuals participating from lower-income countries
8:243:20042:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who are more constrained in terms of opportunities, is that these marketplaces dramatically increase the
8:244:20146:20:20:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pool of available jobs. In addition to increasing the number of opportunities, they also increase the likelihood
8:245:20258:20:20:72:394:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that contractors will \fnd suitable matches for their skills and preferences.
8:246:20335:20:20:86:539:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Contractors also bene\ft from an increase in \rexibility in this market setting. For the most part, these
8:247:20440:20:20:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:transactions are contract-based:  workers are not employees and therefore have more control over their
8:248:20542:20:20:72:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schedules and how they allocate time between the provision of these services and other activities (e.g.,
8:249:20646:20:19:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:another job, family, leisure, etc. (The Economist,2010)). In a survey of workers on oDesk, more than 80%
8:250:20750:19:20:71:539:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:state that the \rexibility and freedom associated with working on the site is a major bene\ft of online work.
8:251:20859:20:20:71:539:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Evidence also shows that the \rexibility provided by telecommunication contributes to a signi\fcant increase
8:252:20967:20:20:71:540:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in female labor force participation (Dettling,2012). Thus, these online marketplaces may induce women
8:253:21068:20:20:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:previously out of the labor market to enter. Especially for contractors in the developing world, who make
8:254:21173:20:20:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:up the vast majority of workers, easier access to job opportunities from entities in higher-income countries
8:255:21281:20:0:72:218:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:might also imply higher earnings.
9:256:21315:0:20:86:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Some ofthe characteristics leading to bene\fts in participating in these markets may also be sources of
9:257:21418:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:costs and risks for contractors.  In particular, the contractual nature of these labor relations might lead
9:258:21525:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to more uncertainty about the duration and conditions of a work relationship. The dramatic increase in
9:259:21627:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:participation in these markets and the typical pro\fle of participants as relatively highly educated suggest
9:260:21735:20:37:72:529:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that on balance these markets represent viable and appealing opportunities for a large set of individuals.
9:261:21841:37:27:72:260:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.3  Demand for contract labor
9:262:21871:27:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The online market for contract labor o-ers several bene\fts to employers relative to traditional o-ine markets.
9:263:21982:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:It lowers the cost of search, communication, and transportation, which bene\fts trade in various services,
9:264:22088:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such as data entry, translation, and software development.  This also enables access to a broader pool
9:265:22190:20:19:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of prospective workers with potentially more suitable skills and possibly at more competitive wage rates.
9:266:22295:19:20:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Although oDesk has a range of organization types and sizes that use the platform, the access to a large and
9:267:22402:20:20:72:540:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:diverse pool of contract workers provided by these platforms is particularly unique for small, entrepreneurial
9:268:22512:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ventures. For instance, in a survey of employers using oDesk, more than half consider themselves start-ups.
9:269:22619:20:20:86:539:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:However, the relative lack of face-to-face interactions might make it di-cult for employers to extract
9:270:22721:20:20:72:540:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:high-bandwidth information (Autor,2001). Furthermore, the increased heterogeneity of applicants make
9:271:22821:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:comparisons among them more challenging; for instance, comparing seemingly similar school degrees or job
9:272:22925:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:experiences of applicants from di-erent countries may be problematic, particularly for novice recruiters. In
9:273:23033:20:20:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:addition to hidden-quality problems, an obvious issue for prospective employers is the di-culty in monitoring
9:274:23142:20:37:72:433:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and verifying e-ort from a distance and through an Internet-mediated transaction.
9:275:23223:37:26:72:253:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.4  Market-making platforms
9:276:23251:26:20:72:540:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Consistent with other two-sided markets, intermediaries in online markets take actions to ensure the partici-
9:277:23360:20:20:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pation of both suppliers and buyers (Armstrong, 2006;Rysman,2009). As mentioned above, a key challenge
9:278:23462:20:20:72:540:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in online contract labor transactions arises from the limited access to high-bandwidth information about
9:279:23566:20:20:72:540:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both applicants and employers (Autor,2001). Online contract labor platforms are increasingly providing
9:280:23668:20:20:72:539:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:features that attempt to solve these information problems.2First, platforms provide a veri\fcation and
9:281:23770:20:20:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:standardization device for some of this information; for example, although o-ine work experiences and edu-
9:282:23876:20:20:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cational attainments cannot be easily compared across individuals, especially if they come from very di-erent
9:283:23985:20:15:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:institutional and cultural contexts, employers can more easily compare work experience accumulated by con-

10:285:24207:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tractors onthe platform (i.e., the number of jobs, duration, types, as well as performance as expressed by the
10:286:24317:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rating given by the employers and workers). This information is available in online contract labor markets
10:287:24423:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on contractor pro\fles, and platforms generally do not allow contractors to delete or block this information
10:288:24531:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from their pro\fles, thus reducing selectivity issues and increasing the reliability of these signals. Platforms

10:290:24751:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:measures for prospective employers. Moreover, some platforms support contractor agencies or companies.
10:291:24853:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Contractors in an agency can cooperate to apply for and complete jobs on the site. Some evidence illustrates
10:292:24961:20:20:72:425:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that agencies help reduce information asymmetries (Stanton and Thomas, 2012).
10:293:25038:20:20:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to providing quality information, online contract labor platforms also help solve challenges
10:294:25142:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the observability and veri\fability of e-ort, on both the worker's and employer's sides, through
10:295:25250:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:various mechanisms. Direct monitoring is available on some platforms through virtual o-ce applications3.
10:296:25354:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Contractors who perform their work while logged into these virtual o-ces are monitored through regular
10:297:25456:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:screen shots and activity logs. To provide incentives for contractors to accept this degree of monitoring, some
10:298:25567:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:platforms guarantee contractor payment for hourly wage work only if it is performed while logged into the
10:299:25672:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:virtual o-ce. Along with direct monitoring, workers' ratings represent a potentially powerful reputational
10:300:25778:20:20:72:357:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism for aligning their objectives with employer objectives.
10:301:25843:20:20:86:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Likewise and as in other online markets, moral hazard issues can arise on the part of employers (see,
10:302:25944:20:20:72:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for instance,Resnick and Zeckhauser(2002) andCabral and Hortacsu(2010) for a discussion of moral
10:303:26040:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:hazard in online markets). For example, employers could refuse to pay for work performed outside virtual
10:304:26144:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:o-ces or to reimburse expenses. However, contract workers can rate their experience with an employer on
10:305:26247:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:most platforms, thus reducing concerns about the risk of exploitative behavior and reneging on previous
10:306:26350:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:agreements. Furthermore, both employers and contractors can \fle disputes if they feel they've been unjustly
10:307:26458:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:charged or underpaid. Platforms act as mediators in these disputes and ultimately decide how they should
10:308:26562:20:13:71:122:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be resolved.
10:309:26574:13:12:83:539:238:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:F:3Evidence shows that strict monitoring is important for the success of working from home.Bloom et al.(2013) study a
10:310:26689:12:9:71:539:226:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:Chinese travel agency that decided to try having some employees work from home. The study \fnds signi\fcant gains from
10:311:26807:9:10:71:539:217:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:working from home in terms of worker productivity and satisfaction.  This may be partially a result of the \frm's careful
10:312:26928:10:9:71:540:207:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:monitoring of telecommuting workers.Dutcher and Jabs Saral(2012) highlight the di-culties that may arise if telecommuting
10:313:27049:9:10:71:539:198:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:workers are not properly monitored by showing experimental evidence that non-telecommuting workers perceive that their
10:314:27167:10:117:71:222:188:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:telecommuting counterparts are shirkers.

11:322:27609:27:20:72:540:556:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The reduction in search, communication, and monitoring costs brought by the digitization of contract labor
11:323:27715:20:19:72:540:536:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:markets raises the possibility of improving employer-contractor matching and thus enhancing gains from
11:324:27817:19:20:72:540:517:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:trade. A consequence of this is a potential impact on the geographic distribution of work. Perhaps the most
11:325:27924:20:20:72:540:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:immediate and dramatic gains are those based on cross-region wage variation. Indeed, the dramatic growth
11:326:28028:20:20:72:540:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in activity on oDesk seems to be primarily of this nature. Speci\fcally, employers in high-income countries
11:327:28135:20:20:72:540:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:hire contractors from low-income countries, even for small jobs that were previously infeasible o-ine due
11:328:28240:20:20:72:540:437:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to transaction costs. As reported in Figure 1, not only were there more than 10 times as many employers
11:329:28343:20:20:72:540:417:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from high compared to lower-income countries by late 2012, but the growth rate of employers from high-
11:330:28445:20:20:72:540:397:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:income countries was much higher than that from lower-income countries. The gap was even greater when
11:331:28546:20:20:72:540:377:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expressed in terms of the wage bill rather than the number of employees (Figure 2). Conversely, by 2013,
11:332:28650:20:20:72:540:357:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approximately 4.5 times as many contractors were from lower- compared to high-income countries (Figure 3).
11:333:28756:20:20:72:540:337:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The trends so far suggest that the spread will continue to increase over time since the number of contractors
11:334:28865:20:20:72:540:317:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from lower-income countries is growing at a faster rate. Figure 4 con\frms this trend also exists in terms of
11:335:28974:20:20:72:540:297:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the total monthly wage bill, not just the number of contractors, despite the fact that, as one might expect,
11:336:29082:20:20:72:339:277:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wages are higher for contractors in more developed countries.
11:337:29143:20:19:86:539:257:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Although access to lower-cost labor is one reason for recruiting distant contractors, employers report other
11:338:29251:19:20:72:540:238:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reasons as well. In a survey of its users conducted by oDesk, 76% indicated that \remote is less expensive"
11:339:29358:20:20:72:540:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:was a primary reason they were interested in using the platform. However, 46% selected \can get work done
11:340:29463:20:20:72:540:198:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:faster remotely," 31% selected \di\u000ecult to \fnd local talent," and 21% selected \no room/equipment." Thus,
11:341:29574:20:20:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in addition to the reduced cost of accessing lower-wage workers, enhanced matching seems to bene\ft from
11:342:29678:20:20:72:201:158:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gains on multiple dimensions.
11:343:29707:20:20:86:539:138:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Countries vary in terms of their level of participation in online contract labor markets. For example, on
11:344:29812:20:0:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oDesk approximately 10 times as many contractors are from the Ukraine as from Spain, even though the
12:345:29913:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:two countries are similar in size (populations in 2013: Ukraine 45m; Spain 47m; however, Spain's economy is
12:346:30020:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approximately 10 times larger: 1.4 trillion USD compared to 0.165 trillion USD for the Ukraine). We illustrate
12:347:30130:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this in Figure 5, where we plot the number of contractors on oDesk per country against population. Nations
12:348:30236:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such as Mexico, Brazil, and China appear to be under-users (participation below what their population
12:349:30337:20:20:72:456:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would predict), whereas the Philippines, Bangladesh, and India appear to be over-users.
12:350:30424:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The variation in usage of this digital marketplace may simply re\rect o-ine employment opportunities.
12:351:30525:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oDesk contractors from Bangladesh and the Philippines, for example, earn signi\fcantly more than local
12:352:30627:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:minimum wages, perhaps partly explaining their disproportionate use of the platform. However, contractors
12:353:30732:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:from China also earn signi\fcantly above the local minimum wage on average yet under-use the platform
12:354:30833:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:relative to other nations. Furthermore, contractors from several countries, like Australia, earn only slightly
12:355:30943:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:more than the local minimum wage, on average, and yet seem to be over-users. This variation re\rects the
12:356:31047:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:relative bene\fts and costs, including opportunity costs, faced by the labor force in each country. Factors such

12:359:31376:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:will provide researchers with useful data to better understand o-ine employment opportunities (particularly
12:360:31483:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where reliable government data is sparse) and the relative returns to di-erent forms of education in a global
12:361:31592:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:work environment.  In addition, they will provide a setting for further analysis on the extent to which

12:363:31789:20:20:86:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The di-erent composition of online contract workers across countries may also explain the unexpectedly
12:364:31891:20:20:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:high average wages received by contractors in certain countries, such as China, Poland, and Russia, as
12:365:31993:20:20:72:540:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reported in Figure 7. Contractors from these three countries in particular are primarily concentrated in
12:366:32097:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:software development, information systems, and web development, which o-er higher wages on average
12:367:32195:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:than most other types of work on oDesk: by 2013, the average wage in software development ($16) was
12:368:32294:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approximately double that of writing and translation ($8) and more than triple that of administrative
12:369:32395:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:support ($4) as well as customer support ($5) and sales and marketing ($5) (Figure 8). Furthermore, the
12:370:32498:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quarterly spend in software development and web development is signi\fcantly greater than in any other
12:371:32600:20:20:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:category (Figure 9). We plot the concentration of total contractor wage bill by country over time in Figure
12:372:32707:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:10. Russia and Ukraine stand out as especially concentrated in only a few sectors (software development in
12:373:32813:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:particular)4. In contrast, contractors from the US and the Philippines do work across many categories. This

12:376:33148:12:34:72:341:105:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:F:software programmers are disproportionately located in Eastern Europe.

13:379:33327:20:38:72:318:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:terms of the distribution of total wages across countries.

13:381:33409:26:20:72:540:626:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The digitization of contract labor markets may a-ect the distribution of income across workers. However,
13:382:33513:20:20:72:540:606:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the direction of this e-ect is ambiguous. On the one hand, digitization could amplify income inequality
13:383:33616:20:20:72:539:586:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by way of the superstar e-ect (Rosen,1981), whereby the shift to lower search costs enables employers to
13:384:33720:20:20:72:540:566:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identify and contract for the best workers (or workers supplying the best value) in a global rather than local
13:385:33830:20:20:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:context such that the distribution of the total wage bill skews further towards a minority of contractors.
13:386:33936:20:20:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:On the other hand, digitization could reduce inequality due to more information leading to less mainstream
13:387:34042:20:19:72:389:506:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:skills in the \long tail" being more e\u000eciently matched (Anderson,2006).
13:388:34118:19:20:86:539:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Researchers report evidence of both types of e-ects resulting from digitization. For example,Tucker and
13:389:34221:20:20:72:539:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Zhang(2007) \fnd that when consumers on a wedding vendor website are able to see the popularity of a given
13:390:34327:20:20:72:540:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:vendor, sales concentrate around the more popular vendors. This suggests that online feedback systems have
13:391:34433:20:20:72:540:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the potential to increase skewness.Elberse and Oberholzer-Gee(2008) \fnd similar support for video sales.
13:392:34538:20:20:72:539:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In other cases, the reverse is true.Zentner et al.(2012) show that online video rentals are less concentrated
13:393:34647:20:20:72:540:387:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:around blockbusters than physical rentals,Peltier and Moreau(2012) show that online book sales in France
13:394:34751:20:20:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are less concentrated around superstars than o-ine, andBrynjol-son et al.(2011) \fnd that Internet sales for
13:395:34859:20:20:71:539:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:women's clothing are less concentrated than catalog sales. All of these papers identify search cost di-erences
13:396:34969:20:20:71:230:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as a core explanation for the results.
13:397:35007:20:20:86:539:307:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Superstar and long tail e-ects are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and both in fact may be at work
13:398:35109:20:20:71:539:287:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the context of online markets for contract labor.  This is because they are in\ruenced by related but
13:399:35213:20:20:71:539:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distinct characteristics of the services traded in this market.  Vertical di-erentiation (quality) drives the
13:400:35322:20:20:71:540:247:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:superstar e-ect, whereas horizontal di-erentiation (variety) drives the long tail e-ect (Bar-Isaac et al.,2012).
13:401:35434:20:19:71:539:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, subject to demand constraints, they may coexist. The superstar e-ect will result in increased
13:402:35538:19:20:71:539:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:income inequality as employers tend towards the highest quality (or best value) contractors based on a global
13:403:35647:20:20:71:539:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rather than local search. Thus, income will shift from contractors supplying the best value locally to those
13:404:35755:20:20:71:539:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:supplying the best value globally. Increased demand will drive up the wages of the highest-quality workers,
13:405:35862:20:20:71:539:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:mainly in cases where the spread is greatest between local and global wages (i.e., low-income countries). The
13:406:35971:20:20:71:492:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:superstar e-ect may be exacerbated due to information asymmetries and features of the market.
13:407:36064:20:0:86:539:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:At the same time, horizontally di-erentiated contractors (e.g., those who specialize in less common areas)
14:408:36172:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whose o-inewages are lower due to limited local demand for their expertise may particularly bene\ft from
14:409:36276:20:20:71:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:digitization since the shift from local to global matching may disproportionately increase the demand for their
14:410:36387:20:20:71:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:skills relative to the supply. For example, a software developer in Malaysia who learns to program in a new
14:411:36494:20:20:71:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cutting-edge language (e.g., django) may bene\ft from digitization since by connecting to the global market
14:412:36601:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that contractor will likely face a greater increase in demand for that skill than an increase in competition
14:413:36709:20:20:71:173:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for supplying that skill.
14:414:36734:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, digitization may shift the income distribution in a manner that bene\fts contractors with
14:415:36835:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:skills that are vertically di-erentiated (i.e., higher quality), horizontally di-erentiated (i.e., scarce), or lower
14:416:36951:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cost (due to fewer local o-ine opportunities) at the expense of those with skills that are neither di-erentiated
14:417:37063:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:nor low cost (i.e., mediocre quality, common skills, in high- or middle-income countries). The net e-ect of
14:418:37170:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such a shift is ambiguous, both at the country level and the individual level. At the country level, although
14:419:37279:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the immediate e-ect of digitization may be to decrease income inequality as the total wage bill shifts from
14:420:37386:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:high- to low-income countries due to expanded search for skills and lower wage rates in low-income countries,
14:421:37495:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the resulting increase in productivity of \frms in high-income countries may further increase o-ine wages
14:422:37600:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there, o-setting the e-ect of o-shoring.  At the individual level, while digitization will favor the highly
14:423:37707:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:skilled relative to the less-skilled, particularly in high-income countries the services provided by a contractor
14:424:37820:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have increasing marginal costs, unlike products with low marginal costs such as music, books, and software.
14:425:37927:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, enhanced matching and constrained supply may at least partially o-set increased competition and
14:426:38033:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thus temper the extent to which digitization ampli\fes the skewness of income distribution at the individual
14:427:38141:20:20:71:93:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:level.
14:428:38147:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Information asymmetries may also a-ect income distribution. The available evidence shows that even
14:429:38245:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small amounts of (employer- or platform-provided) information have a large e-ect on future employment
14:430:38346:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prospects (Pallais, 2012;Agrawal et al.,2013). On the one hand, this may increase the skewness of income
14:431:38450:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution because contractors who obtain a small lead early on, in terms of online work experience with
14:432:38556:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a positive public employer review, may experience subsequent gains and bene\ft from increasing returns (at
14:433:38662:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:least in the short term). On the other hand, to the extent that online markets facilitate low-cost trials for
14:434:38771:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:employers to test working with novice contractors and then publicize their quality, the digitization of this
14:435:38879:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market may decrease skew through the increased public revelation of contractor quality. The fact that a
14:436:38982:19:20:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small amount of veri\fed work experience online is associated with a disproportionate increase in winning
14:437:39087:20:20:71:540:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsequent jobs for contractors in low-income countries (Agrawal et al., 2013) seems consistent with this
14:438:39192:20:0:72:122:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:latter view.

15:440:39232:27:20:71:539:683:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:How will the digitization of this marketplace in\ruence the boundary of the \frm? Economic theory suggests
15:441:39338:20:20:71:539:663:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that because digitization lowers transaction costs (search, communication, and monitoring), the returns to
15:442:39444:20:20:71:540:643:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contracting in the market increase relative to performing these services in-house. For example,Grossman and
15:443:39551:20:20:72:539:623:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Rossi-Hansberg(2008) model the tension between the bene\fts (lower cost of labor) and costs (coordination
15:444:39656:20:19:72:540:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and monitoring) of o-shoring to examine precisely the e-ects of a decline in the cost of o-shoring, focusing
15:445:39764:19:20:72:539:584:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on the productivity e-ect of increased o-shoring. Similarly,Antras and Helpman(2004) present a model
15:446:39864:20:20:72:540:564:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of North-South trade where \fnal-goods \frms choose whether to vertically integrate into the production of
15:447:39970:20:20:72:540:544:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:intermediate goods or to outsource them. Their model o-ers an explanation for variation in \frm boundary
15:448:40074:20:20:72:540:524:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:decisions (in equilibrium, some \frms outsource while others do not, and those that do vary in their out-
15:449:40179:20:20:72:540:504:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sourcing location choice) based on the variation in \frms' productivity levels. Although the authors do not
15:450:40286:20:20:72:540:484:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:focus on the e-ect of falling transaction costs associated with outsourcing per se, the in\ruence of this on
15:451:40394:20:20:72:313:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\frm boundaries is a natural implication of their model.
15:452:40450:20:20:86:539:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Several studies report empirical evidence that digitization is associated with a contraction in the boundary
15:453:40558:20:20:72:540:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the \frm. For example,Abramovsky and Gri-th(2006) report that more ICT-intensive \frms purchase a
15:454:40658:20:20:72:540:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:greater amount of services on the market (rather than vertically integrating) and are more likely to purchase
15:455:40767:20:20:72:539:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:o-shore,Brynjol-son et al.(1994) report that investment in IT is correlated with a subsequent decrease in
15:456:40872:20:20:72:540:364:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\frm size, andHitt(1999) shows that an increase in IT use is correlated with a decrease in vertical integration.
15:457:40984:20:20:86:539:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A recent survey conducted by oDesk of its users sheds further light on the relationship between digitization
15:458:41092:20:19:72:540:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and \frm boundary decisions. Two of the survey questions o-er insight on how employers perceive the online
15:459:41198:19:20:72:540:305:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:platform relative to alternatives for performing contracted work. One of the survey questions asks: \If there
15:460:41307:20:20:72:540:285:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:had not been an appropriate oDesk contractor available for this project, then what would you most likely have
15:461:41416:20:20:72:540:265:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:done?" Of the 6,912 respondents, only 15% indicated they would have turned to a local hire, whereas 22%
15:462:41519:20:20:72:540:245:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:replied they would have worked extra hours, 9% replied they would have delayed or canceled the project, and
15:463:41626:20:20:72:540:225:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:50% indicated that they would have used some other remote source. Although there is room for alternative
15:464:41730:20:20:72:540:205:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:interpretations of these responses (for example, \other remote sources" could refer to other online contract
15:465:41838:20:20:72:540:185:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:labor platforms such that the results under-represent the fraction who would hire locally in the absence of any
15:466:41949:20:20:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:online platforms), one possible explanation is that the digitization of this marketplace directly a-ected the
15:467:42058:20:20:72:540:145:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:boundary of the \frm in only a minority (15%) of the cases. A second oDesk survey question asks: \Thinking
15:468:42164:20:20:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about the last time that you hired a contractor through oDesk, what alternatives did you consider?" In this
15:469:42271:20:0:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:case, respondents were able to select more than one option. Again, only 15% selected \hiring an employee,"
16:470:42379:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whereas 58%selected \doing it myself." Shifting from local to distant contractors appears to be a more
16:471:42481:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:signi\fcant economic e-ect from the digitization of this market than contraction in the boundary of the \frm.
16:472:42590:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, 40% of respondents indicated that a \local contractor" was an alternative they considered when they
16:473:42697:20:20:72:239:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:last hired a contractor through oDesk.
16:474:42735:20:20:86:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:It is important to note that the majority of oDesk users are small businesses (90% of 7,098 survey
16:475:42833:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:respondents indicated that their business had 10 employees or less, with an overall average \frm size of 2.6
16:476:42941:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:employees). This raises the question of how the e-ect of digitizing this marketplace may vary across \frm size.
16:477:43052:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:For example, do small \frms bene\ft disproportionately from digitization? We cannot draw this conclusion
16:478:43156:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:simply from observing a high fraction of small-\frm users. First, the 90% small-\frm user population may just
16:479:43265:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:re\rect the distribution of \frm sizes in the economy (interestingly, respondents reveal that 68% are part-time
16:480:43376:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:businesses, 69% are home-based businesses, and the average \frm age is 2.7 years). Second, the survey sample
16:481:43484:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution may not re\rect the population distribution. Perhaps small \frms are more likely to respond to
16:482:43591:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the survey. Still, one might conjecture that small \frms are more likely to hire contract workers since large
16:483:43700:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\frms are better able to aggregate tasks into full-time jobs and thus avoid the contracting and discontinuity
16:484:43809:19:45:72:244:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:costs associated with task-based hiring.
16:485:43849:45:30:72:197:386:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4  Market design
16:486:43865:30:20:72:540:356:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Platforms in online contract labor markets do not have the match-setting power typical in other contexts
16:487:43969:20:20:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that the market design literature has considered (e.g.Roth and Peranson, 1999;Roth, 2002; Milgrom,2011)
16:488:44072:20:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:because, unlike kidney exchanges and medical student-hospital matching systems, they are not centralized.
16:489:44177:20:20:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:However, an inability to set matches explicitly does not imply an inability to in\ruence which matches are
16:490:44283:20:20:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ultimately formed and under what terms. The position of the platform vis-a-vis the marketplace is more like
16:491:44390:20:20:72:540:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that of a government that sets policies to encourage e-cient market outcomes without dictating trades. The
16:492:44496:20:20:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:platform decides how often and in what context participants are exposed to each other, what information
16:493:44599:20:20:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is collected by parties, and how this information is displayed. Platforms also set policies about what trades
16:494:44708:20:20:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are permissible, how entry is gained, what contracts and prices are allowed, and so on. The platform may
16:495:44812:20:19:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also make recommendations and set defaults. A few market-design decisions in this softer match-making
16:496:44913:19:20:72:427:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:environment are worth considering to explore how these features a-ect matching.
16:497:44992:20:20:86:539:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:First, platforms are in the position to provide standardized and veri\fed information.  For example,
16:498:45092:20:0:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:because oDesk does not permit contractors to delete ratings or comments provided by employers after a job
17:499:45199:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is completed,this information is possibly distinct from what contractors might include in their resumes and
17:500:45306:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thus valuable to potential future employers. In the introduction above, we describe two studies that report
17:501:45413:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\fndings indicating that online work history information has a signi\fcant in\ruence on subsequent matching
17:502:45520:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes (Pallais, 2012; Agrawal et al.,2013).  Furthermore, platforms can provide additional tools for
17:503:45623:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contractors and employers to reveal standardized and veri\fed information about themselves. For example,
17:504:45727:20:20:71:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oDesk provides a series of standardized tests that contractors are able to take so that they may post their
17:505:45834:20:20:71:374:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:scores in order to communicate their pro\fciency in a speci\fc domain.
17:506:45904:20:20:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Given that wading through too much information is costly for a potential employer, does a simple overall
17:507:46008:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:performance score convey an optimal amount of information? Would a more detailed scoring system enhance
17:508:46111:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matching?Pallais(2012) reports that detailed feedback had no e-ect on subsequent outcomes, relative to
17:509:46213:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:simple feedback, for inexperienced contractors. However, for experienced contractors, the extra detail did
17:510:46319:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:make a di-erence. Furthermore, the Pallais result may underestimate the e-ect of a more detailed rating
17:511:46422:20:20:71:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:system since her feedback was conveyed via text rather than, for example, a simple ranking on \fve dimensions.
17:512:46532:20:19:71:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Given the apparently high sensitivity to ratings and feedback, further research into market design features
17:513:46639:19:20:71:511:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that address this particular type of information friction seems a fruitful direction for future research.
17:514:46744:20:20:86:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Second, because contractors have many decisions to make (such as what jobs to apply for, what wage to
17:515:46845:20:20:71:539:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bid, what skills to learn), as do employers (who to hire, whether to use a \fxed or variable fee contract, when
17:516:46956:20:20:71:539:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to o-er a bonus and how much), the digitized nature of these platforms, just like in other online markets, will
17:517:47067:20:20:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:likely lead to the development of algorithmic assistance with decision-making. These recommendation sys-
17:518:47171:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tems will augment human decision-making by, for example, reducing the search costs of market participants.
17:519:47277:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:One potential problem with recommending applicants is crowd-out. Recommending one worker presumably
17:520:47376:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:puts another worker at a disadvantage. However,Horton(2012) shows that the quantity and quality of
17:521:47474:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:matches can be improved via algorithmic recommendations to employers about candidates to recruit for
17:522:47574:20:20:71:300:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:their openings, without signi\fcant crowd-out e-ects.
17:523:47627:20:20:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Aside from the obvious recommendations about who to trade with and at what terms, the platform can
17:524:47725:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also make other kinds of recommendations. It can, for example, advise parties of best practices in how to
17:525:47830:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:manage a working relationship, such as suggesting more communication, periodic raises, and performance
17:526:47932:20:19:71:539:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:evaluations. One interesting challenge of recommender systems is the trade-o- between learning and rec-
17:527:48035:19:20:71:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ommending; recommender systems rely on natural decision-making to explore the space of alternatives to
17:528:48137:20:20:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:train models, but su-ciently good recommender systems that save their users substantial costs are likely to
17:529:48244:20:0:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:displace natural decision-making. So, maintaining some natural decision-making will eventually be costly,
18:530:48351:0:20:72:169:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at leastto some users.
18:531:48373:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Another area where algorithmic recommendations might particularly in\ruence matching is in helping
18:532:48471:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:individuals make good decisions about the accumulation of human capital, particularly around which skills
18:533:48576:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to learn. Traditionally, such decisions are made a small number of times by relatively uninformed individuals
18:534:48685:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who receive one-time feedback about their choices. In o-ine markets, decisions about human capital in-
18:535:48787:20:20:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:vestments are di-cult to observe. Online, these choices are more visible and measurable. On platforms like
18:536:48893:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oDesk, an enormous amount of information illustrates which combination of skills command higher wages in
18:537:48997:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:any particular domain. This enables recommender systems to distill which skills are most valuable to learn
18:538:49103:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:given a contractor's existing capabilities; the system further learns by observing how contractors perform
18:539:49209:20:20:72:162:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:via experimentation.
18:540:49229:20:20:86:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Third, how should contract labor sites allocate visibility? Which applicants should be listed at the top
18:541:49333:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:versus the bottom on an employer's screen? The large size and value of the search engine optimization (SEO)
18:542:49440:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market provides some indication of the importance of visibility. Should allocation preserve assortativity (e.g.,
18:543:49552:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contractors with higher feedback ratings or hours worked are given more visibility)? Should each worker be
18:544:49658:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:given at least some visibility? If visibility is auctioned o-, what would be the e-ciency and distributional
18:545:49766:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:properties of such an allocation?  While this topic has received much attention from researchers in the
18:546:49869:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:private sector at companies like Google and eBay concerning other markets, it remains an open question
18:547:49971:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the context of the market for contract labor.  Yet, this issue is important.  Market design decisions
18:548:50075:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:concerning the allocation of visibility will surely in\ruence matching outcomes, which in turn will in\ruence
18:549:50184:20:20:72:515:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both distribution and welfare e-ects. Moreover visibility relates to congestion, which we discuss next.
18:550:50287:20:20:86:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Fourth, platforms may need to control congestion due to the fact that posting (and applying for) a job
18:551:50389:20:20:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is almost costless. The low cost of applications may lead to an everyone-applies-to-everything equilibrium in
18:552:50498:20:20:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which each application also carries virtually no signal value. This was partly the motivation for introducing
18:553:50607:20:20:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the AEA signalling mechanism (Coles et al.,2010), in which job-market participants are given two (and
18:554:50708:20:20:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:only two) signals to send to schools. The school's knowledge of the scarcity of signals makes those signals
18:555:50815:20:20:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:informative. Accordingly, platforms may consider job application quotas. However, as described above, this
18:556:50921:20:20:72:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:strategy might penalize new entrants with low probabilities of being hired (Pallais, 2012). It also ignores
18:557:51028:20:19:72:540:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:employer heterogeneity, with some employers preferring many applicants and others few. Another potentially
18:558:51134:19:20:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:interesting approach is to allow the employer to decide the cost of applying. These are additional areas for
18:559:51242:20:20:72:299:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:research that re\rect the peculiarities of this market.
18:560:51297:20:0:86:539:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A \ffth interesting market-design feature is the creation of submarkets and categories that are often de\fned
19:561:51408:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:through somecombination of geography and time to coordinate activities and thus create a su-ciently
19:562:51507:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thick market (e.g., the creation of industrial districts for speci\fc sectors). The platform must attempt to
19:563:51615:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:de\fne at some level of detail the various services being supplied and then organize the market accordingly.
19:564:51723:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In the language of machine learning, there is both a clustering task (\fnding the meaningful groups of
19:565:51825:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jobs/contractors based on historical data) and a labeling task (being able to assign a new job to one of the
19:566:51933:20:20:72:288:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identi\fed clusters based on that job's attributes).
19:567:51985:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The \fve market features we describe above represent only a fraction of those that may be important for
19:568:52088:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in\ruencing the matching of employers and contractors as well as the way in which work is managed and
19:569:52189:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:produced online. The unique feature of this line of inquiry, relative to the one described above concerning
19:570:52296:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution and the one below concerning social welfare, is that this research can be performed without o-ine
19:571:52406:20:20:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data. That is because online features can be compared against each other with respect to the behaviour they
19:572:52513:20:20:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:elicit from users. So-called "A/B testing," which refers to controlled randomized experiments that allow for
19:573:52621:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:identifying causal relationships between variations in market design features and subsequent user behaviour,
19:574:52729:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:has already become a standard industry practise for determining the relative performance of competing
19:575:52830:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market design features. That is likely the reason that the majority of research concerning online markets for
19:576:52939:20:45:72:492:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contract labor relate to this line of inquiry whereas there is very little so far on the other topics.
19:577:53041:45:30:72:197:366:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5  Social Welfare
19:578:53058:30:20:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Two immediate consequences of digitization in this market may have important welfare implications. First,
19:579:53163:20:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:digitization may lead to better matching because the pool of prospective workers and employers increases
19:580:53267:20:20:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dramatically due to the decline in costs associated with distance. Second, digitization may lead to e-ciency
19:581:53375:20:37:72:485:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gains from production due to lower coordination costs. We discuss both lines of inquiry below.
19:582:53469:37:26:72:238:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.1  Matching made easier?
19:583:53495:26:20:72:540:213:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The ease of access to online contract labor markets, due to the development of platforms such as oDesk,
19:584:53598:20:20:72:540:193:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Freelancer, Elance, and Guru, has the potential to considerably increase the pool of both job seekers and
19:585:53703:20:20:72:540:173:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:employers and to reduce search costs. Matching models, particularly as applied to labor markets, predict that
19:586:53812:20:20:72:540:153:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this will lead to e-ciency gains due to lower search costs and a lower likelihood of mismatches (Petrongolo
19:587:53919:20:20:72:235:133:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Pissarides,2001;Wheeler,2001).
19:588:53953:20:0:86:539:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:However, opposite forces are also at play. While information technologies reduce the role of distance for
20:589:54060:0:20:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:searchand execution of work, they also lead to a more heterogeneous pool of both workers and employers.
20:590:54163:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In addition, the absence of personal interactions typical of o-ine and more localized labor markets precludes
20:591:54272:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:access to soft or high-bandwidth information about both job seekers and prospective employers (Autor,
20:592:54373:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2001). This introduces uncertainty that in turn may lead to an overall reduction in the quality of workers
20:593:54479:20:20:72:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(Akerlof,1970) and/or to search frictions (Stigler,1962).  These search frictions could be exacerbated if
20:594:54584:20:20:72:523:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quality is di-cult to determine (Wilde, 1981), which is quite possible because of the diverse labor pool.
20:595:54689:20:20:86:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Although theories of search and matching speci\fc to online labor markets have not yet been developed,
20:596:54791:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a growing body of evidence, described above, points to the presence of these informational problems and the
20:597:54898:20:20:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ways in which they are addressed in online contract labor platforms, (Horton,2012; Pallais, 2012; Stanton
20:598:55003:20:20:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Thomas,2012). A common pattern to a number of these studies is to look at the presence of preferences
20:599:55108:20:20:72:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for certain geographic locations of workers as a way to alleviate uncertainty about workers' quality (Mill,
20:600:55215:20:20:72:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2011;Ghani et al., 2012;Agrawal et al.,2013). An implication here is that online contract labor platforms
20:601:55320:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contribute to the alleviation of informational asymmetries by providing veri\fable, standardized information
20:602:55428:20:19:72:477:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(such as previous experience on the same platform) for all workers, regardless of their origin.
20:603:55523:19:20:86:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The broadening of the pool of workers and employers and, at least potentially, the increased likelihood
20:604:55626:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of good matches, is also likely to have implications for wages and income distribution.  The fact that
20:605:55728:20:20:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in online contract labor markets the number of workers outweighs the number of employers in every job
20:606:55829:20:20:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:category suggests that while many workers may be left unemployed, employers have a relatively good chance
20:607:55934:20:20:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of \fnding a worker who meets their criteria, with wages driven down (Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2006).
20:608:56037:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:However, because worker backgrounds may vary more than in traditional labor markets, a relatively small
20:609:56140:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:number of workers may meet the job requirements. As a result, wage o-ers could be higher than expected.
20:610:56243:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This suggests that in job categories with many quali\fed workers, the wages will be lower than in those with
20:611:56351:20:20:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:few quali\fed workers relative to the number of job postings. As the market evolves, wage di-erences between
20:612:56459:20:37:71:229:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:job types should begin to disappear.
20:613:56495:37:26:71:299:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.2  E-ciency gains from production?
20:614:56531:26:20:71:539:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Digitization may lead to e-ciency gains in production due to lower coordination costs that enhance, for
20:615:56634:20:20:71:539:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:example, contractor \rexibility, discretization of work into smaller jobs enabling more specialization, and
20:616:56741:20:20:71:540:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:remote team work. For instance,Dettling(2012) reports that \rexibility provided by IT contributes to an
20:617:56844:20:20:71:539:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the female labor force participation. More broadly, digitization may enable e-ciency gains in
20:618:56949:20:0:71:301:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:production through lowering the cost of outsourcing.
21:619:57003:0:20:86:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Of course,outsourcing and o-shoring predates the development of online contract labor markets. Of
21:620:57100:20:20:72:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:particular relevance here are theories of service outsourcing and o-shoring (e.g.Bhagwati et al.,2004; Francois
21:621:57211:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Hoekman,2010). Combined, these theories predict that the gains to service outsourcing are potentially
21:622:57316:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:signi\fcant.  However, they focus on relatively long arm's-length contracts between relatively large \frms
21:623:57422:20:20:72:534:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rather than on the short contracts between small organizations and individuals, typical of online markets.
21:624:57528:20:20:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Outsourcing services to online contract labor markets is also likely to lead to geographically dispersed
21:625:57632:20:20:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:production, even within narrowly de\fned tasks. For example, work teams may be composed of individuals
21:626:57734:20:20:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who are not necessarily co-located.Lazear(1999) argues that cultural diversity in work teams is costly and
21:627:57840:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:should only occur when skill complementarities exist between teammates to o-set these costs. It may be
21:628:57942:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:harder to meet these conditions in very diverse online labor markets than it is in more traditional labor
21:629:58047:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:markets. Two recent studies based on online labor markets focus on task completion and the e-ects of team
21:630:58152:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:organization, communication structure, incentives, and motivation on performance.Lyons(2013) provides
21:631:58253:20:20:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\feld experimental evidence on how nationally diverse communication impacts online team production and
21:632:58355:20:19:72:540:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:\fnds that nationally homogeneous teams bene\ft from working together but that diverse teams perform better
21:633:58462:19:20:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:when members work independently of one another. Related to the topic of online labor market partnerships,
21:634:58567:20:20:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Horton(2011) uses survey data from the crowdsourcing site Mechanical Turk to show that workers believe
21:635:58669:20:45:72:377:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:employers on the site are more fair and honest than o-ine employers.
21:636:58737:45:30:72:173:346:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6  Conclusion
21:637:58750:30:20:72:540:316:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We identify three broad lines of inquiry as central to the digitization research agenda. All three focus on the
21:638:58861:20:20:72:540:296:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:e-ect of digitizing the market for contract labor. The \frst concerns welfare e-ects, the second distribution
21:639:58970:20:20:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:e-ects, and the third user behavior e-ects. All three are set in the context of the market for contract labor
21:640:59079:20:20:72:347:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:but have broader implications for digitization in other settings.
21:641:59144:20:20:86:539:236:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Access to data will pose a challenge to fully addressing these questions. In contrast to data from online
21:642:59249:20:20:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:platforms that collect information on hiring (as well as pre- and post-hiring) transactions at a granular level
21:643:59360:20:20:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and at low cost, it is costly to obtain even a basic level of o-ine contracting data. Yet, to fully address the \frst
21:644:59477:20:19:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and third lines of inquiry outlined above, o-ine data is required to estimate the causal e-ect of digitization
21:645:59587:19:20:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on changes in distributional properties (geography, income, \frm boundaries) and welfare. This is likely why
21:646:59695:20:20:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:most of the \frst wave of studies concerning the digitization of this market focuses on market design-related
21:647:59804:20:0:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subjects (e.g., experience, agencies, ratings) since these questions only require observing within-platform
22:648:59913:0:20:72:479:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:variationin user behavior and do not require linking these data to non-platform-participants.
22:649:60006:20:20:86:539:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:While the second line of inquiry concerning market design, information frictions, and user behavior is
22:650:60108:20:20:71:539:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:largely spared from the requirement to link with o-ine data, the greatest challenge to this research in the
22:651:60215:20:20:71:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:short and medium term will likely be the rapid evolution of the industry. As illustrated above, the industry
22:652:60323:20:20:71:539:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is growing rapidly. In addition, complementary technologies, such as those associated with mobile and social,
22:653:60432:20:20:71:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are changing rapidly. As such, market design features that seem salient today may be less relevant relative
22:654:60539:20:20:71:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to other features in the future. For example, monitoring technologies such as work rooms with screen shots
22:655:60645:20:20:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:were only recently introduced and are already standard practice across many platforms. Furthermore, they
22:656:60749:20:20:71:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are likely to be replaced soon with better technology such as streaming screen video. While the ultimate goal
22:657:60858:20:20:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of research of this type is obtaining a deeper understanding of human behavior rather than of a particular
22:658:60964:20:20:71:539:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market design feature, the economic salience of the feature is often important for generalizability and yet may
22:659:61075:20:20:71:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be \reeting due to the rapid pace of change in this setting. Still, insight into user response to informational
22:660:61186:20:20:71:237:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:frictions is an important contribution.
22:661:61225:20:19:86:539:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Whereas the distribution and welfare lines of inquiry are most likely to be led by scholars and policy
22:662:61327:19:20:71:539:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:makers, the market design-related research will almost surely include important contributions from industry
22:663:61434:20:20:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:since this issue is of \frst-order importance for product development and competition.  This has already
22:664:61538:20:20:71:540:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:been the case with oDesk (Horton, 2010, 2012) as well as with other market design issues on platforms
22:665:61639:20:20:71:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:such as Google (Varian, 2007;Choi and Varian, 2012), eBay (Blake et al., 2013), and Yahoo (Ghosh and
22:666:61739:20:20:71:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:McAfee, 2011;Lewis and Reiley,2011). Industry interest coupled with their access to high-quality data may
22:667:61844:20:20:71:539:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:signi\fcantly accelerate progress on this research frontier. At the same time, the competitive implications of
22:668:61954:20:20:71:539:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market design insights may inhibit the dissemination of this type of research, and thus the overall impact of
22:669:62063:20:20:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:industry interest in this subject on the rate and direction of progress on this part of the agenda is ambiguous.
22:670:62175:20:20:86:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Given the role that platforms play as the central collectors of data in these markets, they will in\ruence the
22:671:62285:20:20:71:539:251:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:direction of research on all three lines if inquiry through their decisions regarding providing researchers with
22:672:62397:20:20:71:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:access to their data. Early signs are promising for the research community since many of the most prominent
22:673:62504:20:20:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:platforms have established Chief Economists or similar types of research-friendly leadership positions and
22:674:62610:20:20:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:encourage employees to participate in the academic community by publishing their research and participating
22:675:62717:20:19:71:252:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at conferences and other scholarly events.
22:676:62759:19:20:86:539:152:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Given the rapid growth rate of the online market for contract labor, this research agenda is economically
22:677:62864:20:20:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:important.  The welfare-related line of inquiry will help us better understand the potential private and
22:678:62968:20:0:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:social bene\fts due to the digitization of this sector of the economy. The distribution-related line of inquiry
23:679:63081:0:20:72:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:will shedlight on how the bene\fts of digitization may be allocated across countries and individuals as well
23:680:63189:20:20:72:540:690:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as its impact on the structure of the \frm. Finally, the market design-related line of inquiry will provide
23:681:63296:20:20:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:further insight into the importance of particular information frictions and human behavior in the digital
23:682:63401:20:20:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:world as we explore user reactions to platform features, many of which are common across sectors outside of
23:683:63508:20:20:72:540:630:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contract employment. Overall, these insights will be of great interest to scholars, policymakers, and industry
23:684:63618:20:0:72:150:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:participants alike.
