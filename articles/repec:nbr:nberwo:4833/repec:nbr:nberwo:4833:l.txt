3:35:1722:0:31:111:206:722:19:Times:19:Times:C:Introduction
3:36:1734:31:27:111:500:691:16:Times:16:Times:A:In 1959, Leif Johansen noted that production technologies in
3:37:1794:27:26:82:499:664:17:Times:17:Times:C:the existing growth literature were based either on the assump-
3:38:1857:26:27:82:500:638:16:Times:16:Times:A:tion that capital and labor are used in fixed proportions or on the
3:39:1924:27:26:82:497:611:17:Times:17:Times:C:assumption of smooth substitutability between factors. He pro-
3:40:1986:26:28:81:498:585:17:Times:17:Times:C:posed a synthesis of these extremes in which "any increment in
3:41:2048:28:26:81:500:557:17:Times:17:Times:C:production can be obtained by different combinations of incre-
3:42:2110:26:27:82:499:531:17:Times:17:Times:C:merits in labor and capital inputs, whereas any piece of capital
3:43:2174:27:26:81:498:504:16:Times:16:Times:A:which is already installed will continue to be operated by a con-
3:44:2239:26:29:81:499:478:17:Times:17:Times:C:stant amount of labor throughout its lifespan". Suhsequently,
3:45:2300:29:26:81:499:449:17:Times:17:Times:C:Solow (1962), Sheshinski(1967), Calvo (1967, 1976), Cass and
3:46:2360:26:25:81:498:423:16:Times:16:Times:A:Stiglitz (1969), and numerous others investigated the properties
3:47:2424:25:31:81:301:398:16:Times:16:Times:A:of this so-called putty-clay model.
3:48:2459:31:25:111:497:367:17:Times:17:Times:C:In most quantitative work to date, economists have used
3:49:2514:25:27:81:497:342:16:Times:16:Times:A:the now standard model of production with smooth substitution
3:50:2575:27:26:81:498:315:16:Times:16:Times:A:between factors. In that model, the capital stock of the economy
3:51:2639:26:28:81:498:289:16:Times:16:Times:A:can be aggregated into a single state variable. In contrast, in the
3:52:2706:28:25:80:499:261:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-clay model, capital goods come in a wide variety of types
3:53:2769:25:29:80:498:236:16:Times:16:Times:A:indexed by the proportions in which they can be combined with
3:54:2830:29:25:80:498:207:16:Times:16:Times:A:other factors, and, in general, no single capital aggregate can be
3:55:2896:25:26:81:499:182:17:Times:17:Times:C:formed. The concern that this feature of the putty-clay model
3:56:2957:26:27:80:499:156:17:Times:17:Times:C:might give rise to an intractable "curse of dimensionality" may
3:57:3020:27:36:80:273:129:16:Times:16:Times:A:have hindered its application.
3:58:3050:36:0:286:293:93:14:Times:14:Times:F:2
4:59:3051:0:27:143:531:706:17:Times:17:Times:C:In this paper, we build a version of the putty-clay model in
4:60:3111:27:26:114:532:679:16:Times:16:Times:A:which there is a large variety of types of capital goods which are
4:61:3177:26:26:114:530:653:17:Times:17:Times:C:combined with energy in different fixed proportions. Our prin-
4:62:3239:26:27:113:531:627:16:Times:16:Times:A:cipal contribution is to establish easily checked conditions under
4:63:3305:27:28:114:530:600:17:Times:17:Times:C:which the problem of solving for the equilibrium of the model
4:64:3366:28:25:113:532:572:16:Times:16:Times:A:economy reduces to a dynamic programming problem with only
4:65:3424:25:27:114:530:547:16:Times:16:Times:A:two endogenous state variables, regardless of the number of dif-
4:66:3488:27:26:113:530:520:17:Times:17:Times:C:ferent types of capital goods that are allowed. In appropriate
4:67:3550:26:29:114:529:494:17:Times:17:Times:C:applications, this result allows us to avoid the "curse of dimen-
4:68:3615:29:24:113:530:465:16:Times:16:Times:A:sionality" that typically plagues attempts to analyze the dynam-
4:69:3679:24:26:113:531:441:17:Times:17:Times:C:ics of economies with a wide variety of capital goods and bind-
4:70:3742:26:27:113:532:415:17:Times:17:Times:C:ing non-negativity constraints on investment. We apply these
4:71:3802:27:26:113:531:388:16:Times:16:Times:A:results to study the equilibrium dynamics of value-added, invest-
4:72:3867:26:29:113:533:362:16:Times:16:Times:A:ment, wages, and energy use in a simple model of energy use with
4:73:3931:29:34:113:232:333:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-clay capital.
4:74:3950:34:26:143:530:299:17:Times:17:Times:C:Several applied economists have suggested that putty-clay
4:75:4007:26:27:113:529:273:16:Times:16:Times:A:models may be useful in modelling the relationships between en-
4:76:4070:27:25:113:531:246:16:Times:16:Times:A:ergy prices, output, and other aggregate variables. For example,
4:77:4134:25:27:113:531:221:16:Times:16:Times:A:in interpreting differing estimates of the elasticity of energy use
4:78:4201:27:29:113:528:194:16:Times:16:Times:A:in time series and cross section data, Griffin and Gregory (1980)
4:79:4266:29:25:113:531:165:17:Times:17:Times:C:and Pindyck and Rotemberg (1983)argue that the elasticity of
4:80:4326:25:27:113:530:140:16:Times:16:Times:A:energy use is low in the short run and high in the long run. Griffin
4:81:4394:27:36:113:530:113:17:Times:17:Times:C:and Gregory go on to suggest that the putty-clay capital model
4:82:4456:36:0:317:325:77:16:Times:16:Times:A:3
5:83:4457:0:27:88:504:721:17:Times:17:Times:C:may provide a framework that is capable of generating a grad-
5:84:4518:27:28:88:503:694:17:Times:17:Times:C:ual adjustment of energy use in response to a persistent change
5:85:4581:28:24:87:505:666:17:Times:17:Times:C:in energy prices. Pindyck and Rotemberg develop an alterna-.
5:86:4641:24:26:88:504:642:17:Times:17:Times:C:tivé model of gradual adjustment of energy use based on costs
5:87:4702:26:28:88:505:616:17:Times:17:Times:C:of adjustment in capital and labor. In another example, in the
5:88:4764:28:27:88:504:588:17:Times:17:Times:C:business cycle literature, Mork (1989), Tatom (1988), and oth-
5:89:4826:27:28:88:505:561:17:Times:17:Times:C:ers document an asymmetric relationship between energy price
5:90:4886:28:26:88:504:533:16:Times:16:Times:A:changes and output. Specifically, they observe a large negative re-
5:91:4953:26:27:88:505:507:16:Times:16:Times:A:lationship between energy price increases and output but only an
5:92:5017:27:25:88:505:480:16:Times:16:Times:A:insignificant relationship between energy price decreases and out-
5:93:5083:25:27:88:505:455:17:Times:17:Times:C:put. Tatom suggests that these observations may be explained
5:94:5143:27:26:88:506:428:16:Times:16:Times:A:in a model in which the energy intensity of existing capital goods
5:95:5209:26:36:88:138:402:16:Times:16:Times:A:is fixed.
5:96:5218:36:26:118:503:366:16:Times:16:Times:A:In the business cycle literature more broadly, several econo-
5:97:5279:26:26:88:507:340:16:Times:16:Times:A:mists have noted a close relationship between changes in the price
5:98:5345:26:26:88:504:314:17:Times:17:Times:C:of energy and changes in output in post war data. For example,
5:99:5407:26:27:88:505:288:16:Times:16:Times:A:in an often cited article, Hamilton (1983) notes that all but one of
5:100:5475:27:26:89:507:261:16:Times:16:Times:A:the US recessions since World War II have been preceeded a large
5:101:5539:26:27:89:506:235:17:Times:17:Times:C:increase in the price of oil. Others have noted that the correlar-
5:102:5605:27:26:89:507:208:17:Times:17:Times:C:tion between output and the real price of energy is significantly
5:103:5670:26:27:89:505:182:17:Times:17:Times:C:negative. Motivated by these observations, Kim and Loungani
5:104:5729:27:27:90:505:155:17:Times:16:Times:A:(1992), Finn (1992), and Ratti and Raymon (1992) haveused
5:105:5786:27:35:89:507:128:16:Times:16:Times:A:models with putty-putty capital to assess the role of energy price
5:106:5852:35:0:295:302:93:14:Times:14:Times:F:4
6:107:5853:0:27:109:526:709:16:Times:16:Times:A:shocks in generating business cycles. They conclude that energy
6:108:5916:27:26:109:526:682:16:Times:16:Times:A:price shocks can play a significant role, potentially accounting for
6:109:5984:26:25:109:526:656:17:Times:17:Times:C:between 1/6 to 1/3 of the variablility of output. However, the
6:110:6046:25:29:109:527:631:17:Times:17:Times:C:predictions this model give for energy use differ from the data
6:111:6109:29:25:109:528:602:17:Times:17:Times:C:in a key respect: in these models, energy price changes have a
6:112:6171:25:27:109:527:577:17:Times:17:Times:C:large immediate effect on energy use, while in the data, energy
6:113:6234:27:26:109:527:550:17:Times:17:Times:C:use adjusts slowly over time. In related work, Rotemberg and
6:114:6294:26:26:109:527:524:16:Times:16:Times:A:Woodford (1993) develop a model of energy use with fixed costs
6:115:6356:26:26:110:527:498:16:Times:16:Times:A:and imperfect competition. We use a simple calibrated model to
6:116:6418:26:27:110:527:472:17:Times:17:Times:C:obtain some preliminary answers to the question of whether in-
6:117:6480:27:28:110:526:445:16:Times:16:Times:A:troducing putty-clay capital would in fact be useful in addressing
6:118:6546:28:33:110:211:417:16:Times:16:Times:A:these questions.
6:119:6562:33:27:140:529:384:16:Times:16:Times:A:We present three main propositions regarding the solution of
6:120:6622:27:26:110:527:357:16:Times:16:Times:A:the putty-clay model. First, it is immediate that given any wage,
6:121:6687:26:28:110:528:331:16:Times:16:Times:A:energy price, and vector of existing capital goods, there is a cutoff
6:122:6756:28:26:110:528:303:17:Times:17:Times:C:energy intensity such that all capital goods with lower energy
6:123:6818:26:25:110:530:277:16:Times:16:Times:A:intensities are fully utilized and those with higher intensities are
6:124:6886:25:27:110:529:252:16:Times:16:Times:A:left idle. Second, our main result is that, when all existing capital
6:125:6955:27:27:110:529:225:16:Times:16:Times:A:goods are always fully utilized, the equilibrium of the model can
6:126:7020:27:27:110:529:198:16:Times:16:Times:A:be found as the solution of a dynamic programming problem with
6:127:7082:27:26:110:529:171:16:Times:16:Times:A:only two aggregate endogenous state variables. Finally, we show
6:128:7145:26:29:110:529:145:17:Times:17:Times:C:that in this dynamic programming problem there is at most one
6:129:7206:29:34:110:529:116:16:Times:16:Times:A:type of capital with positive investment, even when energy prices
6:130:7271:34:0:315:321:82:12:Times:12:Times:F:5
7:131:7272:0:27:85:503:722:17:Times:17:Times:C:are stochastic. These results give rise to a simple algorithm for
7:132:7337:27:25:85:502:695:16:Times:16:Times:A:computing equilibrium in applications: first solve the simplified
7:133:7402:25:26:85:503:670:17:Times:17:Times:C:dynamic programming problem to obtain a candidate solution
7:134:7460:26:26:85:502:644:17:Times:17:Times:C:and then calculate the cutoff rule corresponding to this solution
7:135:7525:26:27:85:503:618:16:Times:16:Times:A:to verify that the solution indeed satisfies the assumption of full
7:136:7592:27:27:85:502:591:16:Times:16:Times:A:utilization. Verification of this condition confirms the candidate
7:137:7658:27:31:85:403:564:16:Times:16:Times:A:solution as the equilibrium of the original model.
7:138:7708:31:26:115:503:533:16:Times:16:Times:A:We use this algorithm to analyze the impacts of energy price
7:139:7768:26:27:86:502:507:17:Times:17:Times:C:changes in a calibrated model. It turns out in this application
7:140:7831:27:26:86:501:480:17:Times:17:Times:C:that the full utilization condition is always met. Intuitively this
7:141:7898:26:28:86:502:454:17:Times:17:Times:C:is because, in the data, energy costs as a share of total costs are
7:142:7965:28:26:86:503:426:16:Times:16:Times:A:typically low —onthe order of 5 to 15 percent of total costs. We
7:143:8029:26:26:86:503:400:16:Times:16:Times:A:analyze the properties of the model economy under the assump-
7:144:8090:26:26:86:502:374:16:Times:16:Times:A:tion that energy prices follow a Markov process with persistence
7:145:8154:26:26:86:502:348:16:Times:16:Times:A:similar to that estimated by Kim and Loungani (1992) and Finn
7:146:8215:26:26:87:501:322:17:Times:17:Times:C:(1992). We relate these properties to the applied issues men-

8:159:8839:27:26:109:526:602:16:Times:16:Times:A:finite set contained in [0, oo). A unit of capital of type v provides
8:160:8908:26:27:109:527:576:16:Times:16:Times:A:capital services in production only in combination with 1/v units

11:233:12204:31:25:119:506:533:17:Times:17:Times:C:We begin by analyzing the decision to utilize existing cap-

12:260:13349:45:25:104:520:380:14:Helvetica:16:Times:B:Thus,capital of type v is utilized, in the sense that e(v) and n(v)

14:292:14789:26:28:105:522:580:17:Times:17:Times:C:our full utilization condition, then we can use it constructthe

14:294:14891:29:30:136:525:523:17:Times:17:Times:C:To that end consider the problem of choosing sequences

15:310:15398:27:42:98:263:667:16:Times:16:Times:A:(1.5)-(1.9) as follows. Let

15:317:15673:26:28:98:512:421:18:Times:16:Times:A:(2.1) with Z0 =Eko(v)f(v)/vand M0 =ko(v)/v.Let
15:318:15719:28:23:97:513:393:18:Times:17:Times:C:the sequences {k21, It, elñ, ât}be the allocation derived
15:319:15776:23:26:97:515:370:18:Times:18:Times:C:from that solution. If this allocation satisfies condition that
15:320:15839:26:27:97:514:344:18:Times:18:Times:C:v > v(kj(s'),p(s)) for all dates t, states st and capital types
15:321:15902:27:29:97:514:317:17:Times:17:Times:C:v such that kj(v, s1') > 0, then this allocation solves problem
15:322:15965:29:26:98:132:288:16:Times:16:Times:A:(1.4).
15:323:15971:26:28:127:513:262:18:Times:18:Times:C:Proof: If v > v*(ict(st_1),pj(st)) for all dates L, states s
15:324:16031:28:25:97:514:234:18:Times:17:Times:C:and capital types v such that icj(v, tt)>0, then constraint
15:325:16090:25:30:98:514:209:16:Times:16:Times:A:(1.7) always binds. To see that the constructed sequences { k1÷1,
15:326:16155:30:24:120:512:179:16:Times:16:Times:A:el,n,ê1}0solve problem (1.4), it is easiest to rewrite (1.4)
15:327:16215:24:26:97:516:155:18:Times:18:Times:C:with the assumption that (1.7) always binds. To do this, use
15:328:16275:26:36:98:516:129:17:Times:17:Times:C:(1.7) to substitute out for energy use. Then note that the labor
15:329:16339:36:0:299:313:93:14:Times:14:Times:F:14
16:330:16341:0:28:102:520:709:16:Times:16:Times:B:allocation problem is static, and that for a fixed capital stock, its
16:331:16410:28:26:102:519:681:16:Times:16:Times:B:solution takes the form given by the expression for ñ.2(v, 3t). After
16:332:16479:26:29:102:519:655:17:Times:17:Times:C:substitution for energy use and labor into (1.5) and combining
16:333:16541:29:43:103:239:626:16:Times:16:Times:B:(1.5) with (1.6) gives
16:334:16563:43:55:240:517:583:22:Times:15:Times:C:c(st)+Ext(v,st) -(2.6)

16:337:16628:40:29:103:520:495:17:Times:17:Times:C:Keeping (1.3) as before this simplified problem is then one of
16:338:16690:29:24:104:520:466:17:Times:17:Times:C:choosing sequences for {kj÷i(v, 5t), xt(V, 3t), c1} to maximize
16:339:16753:24:26:104:520:442:18:Times:18:Times:C:(1.4) subject to (2.6) and (1.3). Final substitution of Z+i(st)
16:340:16816:26:26:104:521:416:18:Times:18:Times:C:for Ek2÷i(v,st)f(v)/v and Mt+i(s1) for >1cj+i(v,st)/v makes
16:341:16875:26:26:104:522:390:17:Times:17:Times:C:it easy to see that the constructed sequences derived from the
16:342:16937:26:29:103:447:364:16:Times:16:Times:B:solution to (2.1) solve this simplified version of (1.4).
16:343:16994:29:27:134:521:335:16:Times:16:Times:A:We now show that in the solution to problem (2.1), in each
16:344:17052:27:26:104:522:308:17:Times:17:Times:C:period and each state of nature, there is positive investment in
16:345:17116:26:31:104:284:282:17:Times:17:Times:C:at most one type of capital.
16:346:17144:31:24:134:521:251:19:Times:19:Times:C:Proposition 3: (One Type of Investment) Let {2+,
16:347:17192:24:27:204:521:227:17:Times:17:Times:C:solve problem (2.1). Then at each date t and in
16:348:17239:27:30:104:518:200:17:Times:17:Times:C:each state 3*, there is at most one v E V such that 1t(u,st)> 0.
16:349:17303:30:26:134:521:170:17:Times:17:Times:C:Proof: In the case that all capital is always fully utilized,
16:350:17364:26:29:104:523:144:16:Times:16:Times:B:we may examine the properties of the solutions of problem (2.1).
16:351:17428:29:34:104:521:115:17:Times:17:Times:C:Let Aflst),Af(st) AJ(3t) and Af(v,st) be Lagrange multipliers

17:358:17728:24:27:91:507:575:17:Times:17:Times:C:Furthermore, this multiplier is non-negative, so that zero is its
17:359:17793:27:28:91:507:548:16:Times:16:Times:A:minimum value. Let i3 be at type of capital that receives positive
17:360:17859:28:26:91:506:520:17:Times:17:Times:C:investment. Since zero is the minimum value of AT(v,5t),not
17:361:17918:26:27:91:505:494:16:Times:14:Helvetica:A:only is A(i, 8t) equal to zero, but so is the derivative of AT(i3,3t)
17:362:17987:27:29:91:508:467:16:Times:16:Times:A:with respect to v. The derivative of A7(v, 3t) with respect to v is
17:363:18054:29:28:91:145:438:16:Times:16:Times:A:given by
17:364:18062:28:38:180:347:410:15:Times:20:Times:C:[—Af(st)(f'(v)v —1(v))+
17:365:18085:38:27:91:508:372:16:Times:16:Times:A:The sign of this derivative depends on the sign of the numerator
17:366:18149:27:25:91:508:345:16:Times:16:Times:A:of this expression. The multiplier AZ is positive (since Z increase
17:367:18216:25:28:91:508:320:17:Times:17:Times:C:welfare) and the multiplier AM is negative (since M decreases
17:368:18277:28:25:91:507:292:16:Times:16:Times:A:welfare). Since f(v) is strictly concave, this numerator is strictly
17:369:18345:25:26:90:505:267:17:Times:16:Times:A:increasing in v. Thus, the derivative of A(v,8i)is strictly nega-
17:370:18410:26:27:91:506:241:16:Times:17:Times:A:tive for v <€3andstrictly positive for v > 5. Hence, if it exists,
17:371:18476:27:31:91:335:214:16:Times:16:Times:A:13 is the unique minimizer of M(v, 3t).
17:372:18515:31:26:120:507:183:16:Times:16:Times:A:While we find that proposition 3 is useful in simplifying com-
17:373:18577:26:27:91:507:157:17:Times:17:Times:C:putation 0 equilibrium, we also find that it sheds some light on
17:374:18641:27:36:91:509:130:17:Times:17:Times:C:the workings of the model. At first glance, one might think that
17:375:18705:36:0:293:306:94:13:Times:13:Times:F:16
18:376:18707:0:26:102:520:716:16:Times:16:Times:B:the problem of choosing which types of capital goods to invest in
18:377:18772:26:28:102:520:690:16:Times:16:Times:B:would be similar to a portfolio allocation problem, with multiple
18:378:18837:28:25:102:519:662:17:Times:17:Times:C:types of capital receiving positive investment in a given period
18:379:18901:25:27:102:519:637:17:Times:17:Times:C:for reasons of diversification. This proposition shows that this
18:380:18965:27:26:102:518:610:17:Times:17:Times:C:analogy is flawed: under the condition that all capital is always
18:381:19030:26:27:102:521:584:17:Times:17:Times:C:fully utilized, in this model, at each date and in each state of
18:382:19094:27:26:102:518:557:17:Times:17:Times:C:nature, there is always at most one optimal type of capital for
18:383:19157:26:27:102:520:531:17:Times:17:Times:C:investment. To see why this is true, it is useful to consider the
18:384:19222:27:29:102:518:504:16:Times:16:Times:B:problem of choosing investment in this model as a portolio selec-
18:385:19287:29:34:103:189:475:16:Times:16:Times:B:tion problem.
18:386:19300:34:26:133:520:441:16:Times:16:Times:A:Given the description of the production technology, at each
18:387:19359:26:27:102:519:415:18:Times:18:Times:C:date tandin each state of nature s, it takes one unit of con-
18:388:19420:27:26:102:520:388:17:Times:17:Times:C:sumption to produce a unit of new investment in capital of type

21:455:22053:27:27:91:507:510:17:Times:17:Times:C:investment. This choice, of course, varies at each date with the
21:456:22117:27:28:91:178:483:17:Times:17:Times:C:current state.
21:457:22131:28:26:120:507:455:16:Times:16:Times:A:This result does not generalize to cases in which some types
21:458:22191:26:26:91:508:429:17:Times:17:Times:C:of capital are left idle in some states of nature. To see why not,
21:459:22257:26:28:91:506:403:17:Times:16:Times:A:consider a two period example, with dates t= 0,1,with uncer-

21:461:22377:26:26:91:509:349:17:Times:17:Times:C:period. Let there be two types of capital v1, v2 and assume that
21:462:22441:26:26:91:509:323:17:Times:17:Times:C:capital of type 1 is left idle in state s2. The return to investing
21:463:22508:26:26:91:508:297:17:Times:17:Times:C:in capital of type v in this case is simply the marginal product
21:464:22572:26:26:90:507:271:17:Times:16:Times:A:of capital of that type at t= 1.Thus Rj(vi, 82)= 0.Consumers

22:476:22984:35:27:134:521:560:17:Times:17:Times:C:In this section we present an application of these results in
22:477:23045:27:26:104:521:533:17:Times:17:Times:C:which energy prices follow a Markov process. The solution to
22:478:23105:26:27:104:522:507:17:Times:17:Times:C:the model can be found as the solution to a Bellman equation
22:479:23165:27:27:104:520:480:17:Times:17:Times:C:with two endogenous state variables and two controls. Let en-
22:480:23226:27:26:104:523:453:17:Times:17:Times:C:ergy prices follow a Markov process with a finite set of states
22:481:23289:26:27:105:522:427:17:Times:17:Times:C:{p}. Let ir(p',p) be the probability that the energy price is p' at

22:483:23418:26:28:104:522:374:16:Times:16:Times:B:equilibrium under the assumption that for every realization of the
22:484:23484:28:24:104:523:346:16:Times:16:Times:B:Markov process for energy prices, the corresponding equilibrium
22:485:23547:24:25:104:522:322:16:Times:16:Times:B:capital stock is always fully utilized. We then verify this assump-
22:486:23614:25:28:104:521:297:17:Times:17:Times:C:tion after calculation. Given this assumption, we can treat the
22:487:23677:28:25:104:521:269:16:Times:16:Times:B:problem (2.1) as a dynamic program with endogenous state vari-

23:505:24410:27:26:91:509:375:16:Times:16:Times:A:Presumably, a wide variety of alternative solution methods would
23:506:24474:26:30:90:174:349:16:Times:16:Times:A:work as well.
23:507:24487:30:26:120:509:319:16:Times:16:Times:A:Before presenting the findings from the stochastic simulation
23:508:24548:26:27:90:509:293:17:Times:17:Times:C:of the model, it is useful to look at some static calculations to
23:509:24613:27:26:90:510:266:17:Times:17:Times:C:get a sense of the size of the immediate impact of energy price
23:510:24676:26:27:90:508:240:17:Times:17:Times:C:shocks of various sizes on value-added in the model economy
23:511:24735:27:27:91:508:213:17:Times:17:Times:C:and to examine the range of price changes for which all capital
23:512:24798:27:27:91:509:186:16:Times:16:Times:A:remains fully utilized. We present these calculations in Table 1.
23:513:24863:27:27:91:510:159:18:Times:18:Times:C:We assume that the capital stock that exists at date 0 is the
23:514:24924:27:35:90:508:132:17:Times:17:Times:C:capital stock that holds in the steady state of the model when
23:515:24986:35:0:292:307:97:15:Times:15:Times:F:22
24:516:24988:0:25:104:521:714:17:Times:16:Times:B:energy prices are permanently fixed at p =1.We then calculate
24:517:25049:25:27:105:523:689:16:Times:16:Times:B:value-added in period 0 for various values of p. For comparison,
24:518:25113:27:26:105:523:662:17:Times:17:Times:C:we include the same calculation for the case in which capital is
24:519:25177:26:29:104:521:636:17:Times:15:Times:C:putty-putty, so that there is a single capital stock Itandgross
24:520:25240:29:24:104:522:607:17:Times:17:Times:C:output is given by Q= (k°e('°))°n('°).We also calculate the
24:521:25299:24:27:104:521:583:16:Times:16:Times:B:steady state level of value-added that will obtain if the new energy
24:522:25367:27:25:104:521:556:16:Times:16:Times:B:price lasts forever. In the calculations in Table 1, we assume that
24:523:25434:25:29:119:522:531:18:Times:17:Times:C:=.96,labor's share (1 —0) intotal costs due to capital, labor,
24:524:25496:29:27:105:522:502:16:Times:16:Times:B:and energy is 2/3 and that energy's share 0(1 —a)in these costs
24:525:25559:27:27:105:523:475:17:Times:17:Times:C:in the steady state when energy prices are constant is 1/20. We
24:526:25622:27:26:105:522:448:16:Times:16:Times:B:set 5= .08.These figures are roughly consistent with cost shares
24:527:25686:26:31:105:319:422:16:Times:16:Times:B:for the U.S. economy as a whole.
24:528:25718:31:27:135:524:391:17:Times:17:Times:C:There are three main regularities that emerge from these
24:529:25774:27:25:105:524:364:16:Times:16:Times:B:calculations. First, the immediate impact of a large energy price
24:530:25839:25:29:105:523:339:17:Times:17:Times:C:increase is larger in the putty-clay economy than in the putty-
24:531:25902:29:24:105:524:310:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty economy. Second, the impact of energy price changes is
24:532:25962:24:28:106:523:286:17:Times:17:Times:C:asymmetric in the putty-clay economy in comparison with the
24:533:26021:28:24:105:523:258:16:Times:16:Times:B:putty-putty economy: energy prices increases have a greater im-
24:534:26084:24:27:106:524:234:17:Times:17:Times:C:pact on value-added than energy price decreases. Third, when
24:535:26144:27:27:106:524:207:17:Times:17:Times:C:the cost share for energy is low, there is a wide range of energy
24:536:26209:27:33:106:423:180:16:Times:16:Times:B:prices for which all capital remains fully utilized.
24:537:26261:33:24:135:524:147:17:Times:17:Times:C:In comparing the asymmetric relationship between energy
24:538:26316:24:36:106:524:123:18:Times:18:Times:C:prices and output reported in Table 1 to that found by Mork
24:539:26375:36:0:307:322:87:15:Times:15:Times:F:23
25:540:26377:0:29:85:499:716:17:Times:17:Times:C:(1989) and Tatom (1988), recall that these authors ran regres-
25:541:26439:29:25:84:501:687:17:Times:17:Times:C:sions of log changes in output on log changes in energy prices.
25:542:26502:25:27:84:501:662:17:Times:17:Times:C:The price columns in Table 1 correspond to equal positive and
25:543:26563:27:28:84:502:635:16:Times:16:Times:A:negative changes in the log of the energy price while the percent-
25:544:26629:28:24:85:501:607:17:Times:17:Times:C:age changes in output reported in the table approximate the log
25:545:26692:24:28:85:503:583:17:Times:17:Times:C:of the change in output. The figures in the table indicate that
25:546:26755:28:26:85:503:555:16:Times:16:Times:A:with an energy cost share of 5 percent, approximating the energy
25:547:26819:26:26:85:503:529:16:Times:16:Times:A:cost share for the economy as a whole, capital is not left idle until
25:548:26888:26:27:85:501:503:17:Times:17:Times:C:energy prices increase by more than a factor of 6. If we set the
25:549:26952:27:26:85:501:476:16:Times:16:Times:A:energy cost share to 15 percent, approximating numbers reported
25:550:27015:26:26:85:503:450:16:Times:16:Times:A:by Griffin and Gregory for the manufacturing sector of the econ-
25:551:27079:26:27:85:502:424:17:Times:17:Times:C:omy alone, capital is not left idle until energy prices more than
25:552:27144:27:35:85:132:397:16:Times:16:Times:A:double.
25:553:27151:35:27:115:503:362:16:Times:16:Times:A:We now consider an economy in which energy prices follows
25:554:27208:27:27:86:502:335:16:Times:16:Times:A:a Markov process. We compare the properties of a models with
25:555:27268:27:25:86:505:308:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-clay and putty-putty technologies. Let the parameters of
25:556:27330:25:27:86:504:283:17:Times:17:Times:C:preferences and technology be as before. Let the energy price
25:557:27391:27:27:86:502:256:16:Times:17:Helvetica:A:process take on two states, a high state phanda low state pj.Let

25:560:27588:27:27:86:502:176:16:Times:16:Times:A:and variance are similar to those found by Finn(1992), Kim and
25:561:27650:27:30:86:502:149:17:Times:17:Times:C:Loungani(1992), and Ratti and Raymon(1992). These statistics

26:565:27809:28:26:135:520:681:16:Times:16:Times:A:In Table 2, we report statistics from these economies assum-
26:566:27869:26:26:105:523:655:17:Times:17:Times:C:ing first putty-clay and then putty-putty capital. The mean and
26:567:27932:26:27:105:522:629:17:Times:17:Times:C:the standard deviation of output are nearly the same in the two
26:568:27995:27:26:105:521:602:17:Times:17:Times:C:models. Mean energy use in the putty-clay economy is about 5
26:569:28055:26:27:104:521:576:17:Times:17:Times:C:percent lower than in the putty-putty economy. The standard
26:570:28114:27:26:104:522:549:16:Times:16:Times:B:deviation of energy use in the putty-clay economy is less than 60
26:571:28179:26:27:104:521:523:16:Times:16:Times:B:percent its level in the putty-putty economy. The standard devi-
26:572:28243:27:27:105:523:496:16:Times:16:Times:B:ation of wages in the putty-clay economy is less than 75 percent
26:573:28307:27:27:104:522:469:16:Times:16:Times:B:of that in the putty-putty economy, while the standard deviation
26:574:28371:27:28:104:522:442:16:Times:16:Times:B:of investment is 15 percent higher in the putty-clay economy. En-
26:575:28436:28:26:104:522:414:16:Times:16:Times:B:ergy use, wages, and investment are highly correlated with output
26:576:28501:26:26:104:521:388:16:Times:16:Times:B:in both economies, but slightly less so in the putty-clay economy.
26:577:28567:26:27:104:521:362:16:Times:16:Times:B:Finally, in the putty-clay economy, the response of output to en-
26:578:28632:27:24:104:523:335:16:Times:16:Times:B:ergy price changes is asymmetric, while in the putty-putty model
26:579:28696:24:32:104:204:311:16:Times:16:Times:B:it is symmetric.
26:580:28712:32:28:134:521:279:16:Times:16:Times:A:To get some intuition for the workings of the economy, we
26:581:28769:28:25:104:522:251:16:Times:16:Times:B:plot segments of realized energy prices and major aggregates from
26:582:28834:25:27:104:522:226:16:Times:16:Times:B:simulations of both economies. These plots are presented in Fig-
26:583:28898:27:27:104:522:199:17:Times:17:Times:C:ures 1-7. Figures 1 and 2 plot the path of energy prices and the
26:584:28962:27:27:104:521:172:16:Times:16:Times:B:corresponding paths of value-added. Note that when the energy.
26:585:29024:27:26:104:521:145:16:Times:16:Times:B:price rises, value-added fails more initially and stays lower in the
26:586:29092:26:36:104:522:119:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-clay case. When the energy price falls, value-added rises
26:587:29155:36:0:304:319:83:15:Times:15:Times:F:25
27:588:29157:0:27:93:510:721:17:Times:17:Times:C:further initially in the putty-putty case. We also see the asym-
27:589:29221:27:26:92:512:694:16:Times:16:Times:A:metric initial response of value-added to energy prices changes in
27:590:29287:26:34:92:336:668:16:Times:16:Times:A:the putty-clay model in these figures.
27:591:29325:34:24:122:510:634:16:Times:16:Times:A:The asymmetric response of output to energy price changes
27:592:29382:24:30:92:510:610:17:Times:17:Times:C:in the putty-clay economy can be understood as follows. Dur-
27:593:29442:30:25:92:511:580:16:Times:16:Times:A:ing a long spell of low energy prices, the energy intensity of the
27:594:29508:25:27:92:510:555:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-clay economy builds up over time. When this long spell
27:595:29568:27:25:92:511:528:17:Times:17:Times:C:is followed by an energy price increase, the impact of this price
27:596:29633:25:29:92:510:503:17:Times:17:Times:C:increase on value-added is large. On the other, hand, if a long
27:597:29696:29:24:92:509:474:16:Times:16:Times:A:spell of high energy prices is followed by an energy price decline,
27:598:29763:24:26:92:511:450:16:Times:16:Times:A:the energy intensity of the economy will be low so that the price
27:599:29828:26:32:92:423:424:16:Times:16:Times:A:decrease will not have much affect on value-added.
27:600:29878:32:26:122:511:392:17:Times:17:Times:C:Figure 3 plots the transition paths of energy use in the two
27:601:29938:26:26:93:509:366:17:Times:17:Times:C:models. Here the difference between the two modeLs is stark:
27:602:29998:26:27:93:510:340:17:Times:17:Times:C:in the putty-clay model, energy use adjusts slowly, while in the
27:603:30062:27:25:92:510:313:17:Times:17:Times:C:putty-putty model, the adjustment is instantaneous. Figure 4
27:604:30122:25:26:92:512:288:14:Helvetica:16:Times:A:showsthat when the price of energy rises, investment falls in both
27:605:30188:26:27:92:511:262:17:Times:17:Times:C:the putty-clay and putty-putty models, but the drop is larger in
27:606:30252:27:30:92:510:235:17:Times:17:Times:C:the putty-clay model. Figure 5 shows that wages adjust more
27:607:30311:30:24:92:509:205:17:Times:17:Times:C:gradually following energy price changes. Figure 6 shows the
27:608:30371:24:27:92:509:181:16:Times:16:Times:A:fraction of the payments to energy and capital that go to energy.
27:609:30436:27:27:92:510:154:16:Times:16:Times:A:This fraction almost doubles initially when the energy price dou-
27:610:30501:27:36:92:509:127:16:Times:16:Times:A:bles and then falls gradually as there is investment in less energy
27:611:30568:36:0:293:308:91:15:Times:15:Times:F:26
28:612:30570:0:25:103:520:708:16:Times:16:Times:B:intensive types of capital. Note that when the energy price rises,
28:613:30636:25:29:103:521:683:16:Times:16:Times:B:the higher payments to energy come out of the returns to capital.
28:614:30701:29:27:132:522:654:16:Times:16:Times:A:Figure 7 shows the energy intensity of new investment. The
28:615:30759:27:27:103:521:627:16:Times:16:Times:B:choice of the type of new investment is quite responsive to energy
28:616:30825:27:25:103:521:600:17:Times:17:Times:C:price changes because these changes are persistent. In addition,
28:617:30889:25:28:103:522:575:16:Times:16:Times:B:there are small changes in the type of new investment that occur
28:618:30953:28:29:103:520:547:17:Times:17:Times:C:as the energy intensity of the existing capital stock gradually
28:619:31016:29:26:103:152:518:16:Times:16:Times:B:adjusts.
28:620:31024:26:29:133:214:492:18:Times:18:Times:C:Conclusion
28:621:31034:29:26:133:521:463:17:Times:17:Times:C:Despite the early theoretical attention given to putty-clay
28:622:31093:26:26:103:520:437:16:Times:16:Times:B:models of capital, they have not found frequent use in stochastic
28:623:31158:26:26:104:522:411:16:Times:16:Times:B:applications. We show that, in fact, the putty-clay model is quite
28:624:31224:26:27:103:520:385:17:Times:17:Times:C:tractable, even in stochastic applications, as long as a certain
28:625:31288:27:27:103:522:358:18:Times:18:Times:C:condition is met. We present an application of the model to
28:626:31347:27:29:103:480:331:17:Times:17:Times:C:energy use and find that this condition is met in practice.
28:627:31406:29:26:133:521:302:17:Times:17:Times:C:Simulation of this simple model produce several observa-
28:628:31462:26:28:104:522:276:17:Times:17:Times:C:tions. First, this model produces a negative correlation between
28:629:31526:28:26:103:521:248:17:Times:17:Times:C:energy prices and output. Second, this relationship between en-
28:630:31589:26:25:103:523:222:16:Times:16:Times:B:ergy prices and output is asymmetric. Third, energy use responds
28:631:31653:25:27:104:522:197:16:Times:16:Times:B:gradually to persistent changes in energy prices. While it is true
28:632:31719:27:27:104:522:170:17:Times:17:Times:C:that the putty-putty model produces a negative corrlation be-
28:633:31780:27:26:104:522:143:17:Times:17:Times:C:tween output and energy prices, it is not consistent with these
28:634:31843:26:36:104:521:117:16:Times:16:Times:B:latter two observations. In this sense, the putty-clay model is an
28:635:31909:36:0:305:320:81:15:Times:15:Times:F:27
29:636:31911:0:26:85:503:716:17:Times:17:Times:C:improvement over the putty-putty model in terms of capturing
29:637:31971:26:27:85:503:690:16:Times:16:Times:A:salient features of the data. While these results seem promising,
29:638:32036:27:27:85:504:663:16:Times:16:Times:A:more detailed work will be needed to see if this putty-clay model
29:639:32101:27:549:85:485:636:16:Times:16:Times:A:will prove useful in modelling energy use and business cycles.
