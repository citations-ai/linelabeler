2:9:263:0:35:212:475:707:14:Times New Roman:14:Times New Roman:Pakistan Economy: Caught in a Maelstrom 
2:10:301:35:32:248:438:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rashid Amjad* and Musleh ud Din** 
2:11:333:32:21:144:543:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Starting in the second half of 2007, the Pakistan economy began to show distinct 
2:12:414:21:21:108:543:619:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:signs of slowing down and started experiencing serious pressures on its fiscal and balance 
2:13:505:21:20:108:543:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  payments  situation.  Growth  in  the  economy  took  a  sharp  downward  turn.  By  early 
2:14:600:20:21:108:543:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2012  the  economy  still  had  not  recovered  and  remained  mired  in  deep  stagflation – 
2:15:693:21:21:108:543:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characterised  by  low  growth  and  high  inflation.  Economic  policies  that  were  adopted, 
2:16:789:21:21:108:543:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including  the  ones  under  an  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  programme  since 
2:17:877:21:32:108:479:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:November 2008, appear to have been of little help in reversing this situation. 
2:18:955:32:21:144:543:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Why Pakistan’s economy has not been able  to  break  out  of  stagflation?  What 
2:19:1036:21:21:108:542:462:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fundamental  factors  have  been  responsible  for  this  situation? Why  has  Pakistan  been  the 
2:20:1134:21:20:108:542:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:laggard  among  the  countries  in  South  Asia  and  the  larger  Asia-Pacific  region, that  were 
2:21:1233:20:21:108:543:421:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:able to relatively recover faster from the global financial crisis? What measures are needed 
2:22:1326:21:21:108:543:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  move  out  of  this  maelstrom?  This  chapter  attempts  to  answer  these  questions.  Its 
2:23:1423:21:20:108:543:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fundamental  message  is  that  the  Pakistan’s economy  faces  serious  structural  imbalances 
2:24:1518:20:21:108:540:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which make it very vulnerable to external shocks and are primarily responsible for its stop-
2:25:1610:21:21:108:542:338:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:go  cycles  of  economic  growth  (Amjad  et  al.,  2011  and  McCartney,  2011).  The  economic 
2:26:1707:21:20:108:542:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problems  the  country  faces, as  we  show  in  this  chapter, are  basically  structural  in  nature 
2:27:1808:20:33:108:405:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and not just due to cyclical movements in the global economy. 
2:28:1869:33:33:108:319:264:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Pakistan’s recent economic performance 
2:29:1907:33:21:144:542:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Understanding the dynamics of Pakistan’s economy has never been easy. Time 
2:30:1981:21:20:108:543:210:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and  again  the  country’s  economic  performance  has  proven  its  critics  wrong.  With 
2:31:2072:20:21:108:543:190:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively  low  levels  of  investments  and  savings,  its  growth  performance  has  been 
2:32:2165:21:21:108:542:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reasonably  impressive  though  not  spectacular.  During  1970-2010,  its  average  rate  of 
2:33:2259:21:20:108:543:148:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth  was  a  healthy  5  percent,  though  its  growth  path  has  always  moved  in  stop-go 
2:34:2356:20:31:108:144:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cycles.

3:38:2556:0:21:144:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During 2002 to 2007, Pakistan had been witnessing a phase of impressive growth 
3:39:2635:21:21:108:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with moderate inflation (Table 6.1). There were no real signs that the economy was about 
3:40:2723:21:20:108:543:667:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:to falter, though there was some unease expressed about the economy’s susceptibility to 
3:41:2811:20:21:108:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:external  shocks  (Amjad,  2007). Indeed,  official  circles  were  upbeat  about  the  economic 
3:42:2907:21:21:108:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance with claims that Pakistan had finally freed itself from its past heavy reliance 
3:43:2999:21:21:108:542:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on external borrowings and was on a path of achieving self-reliant sustainable growth. It 
3:44:3089:21:20:108:542:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was therefore somewhat of a rude surprise when the Pakistan economy suddenly plunged 
3:45:3174:20:33:108:315:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:into a deep economic crisis in 2007-2008.

3:53:3645:14:26:108:180:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:various issues. 
3:54:3660:26:20:144:543:369:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:What is perhaps not well-known is that Pakistan’s economy faltered not with the 
3:55:3740:20:21:108:543:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) in the second half of 2008 but before that, when 
3:56:3831:21:21:108:540:328:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the economy was hit by an unprecedented increase in global oil and food prices in 2007-
3:57:3918:21:20:108:543:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2008.  This  shock  forced  policy  makers  to  adopt  contractionary  policies  to  stabilise  the 
3:58:4018:20:21:108:540:287:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy.  These  measures  were  reflected  in  the  budget  adopted  in  June  2008  for 2008-
3:59:4113:21:21:108:542:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2009. Though not officially acknowledged, the agreement appeared to have been reached 
3:60:4199:21:20:108:542:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with the IMF for support, even though the IMF programme was signed later that year in 
3:61:4284:20:33:108:191:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:November 2008. 
3:62:4298:33:21:144:543:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The basic question then is not just about the impact of the global recession on the 
3:63:4382:21:21:108:543:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy of  Pakistan.  Equally,  and perhaps  more  important, is the  vulnerability  of  the 
3:64:4474:21:20:108:543:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  to  the  oil  and  commodity  price  shock  that  preceded  the  global  recession.  It  is 
3:65:4575:20:21:108:543:130:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:then quite pertinent to ask whether Pakistan’s economy would have actually fared not too 
3:66:4664:21:21:108:543:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differently   from   its   other South   Asian   neighbours   in   terms   of   deflecting   (and 
3:67:4762:21:0:108:543:88:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subsequently  recovering  faster  from)  the  GFC  in  the  absence  of  the  oil  and  commodity 
4:68:4860:0:21:108:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:price shock. To try and answer this question we start by examining Pakistan’s economic 
4:69:4946:21:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance   post-2000   in   terms   of economic   growth   and   the   movement   of   key 
4:70:5039:21:32:108:297:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:macroeconomic indicators (Table 6.1). 
4:71:5076:32:21:144:543:635:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:The  turnaround  in  Pakistan’s  economy  post-2003  was  preceded  by  a  sharp 
4:72:5157:21:21:108:543:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compression as the new Musharraf government entered into an IMF agreement in 1999 in 
4:73:5242:21:21:108:542:593:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:the face of a possible debt default and very high fiscal deficits. Pakistan’s economy in the 
4:74:5335:21:20:108:543:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1990s had not performed well as successive democratic governments were unable to push 
4:75:5421:20:21:108:543:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through   the   needed   reforms   and   successfully   complete   any   of   the   IMF   support 
4:76:5519:21:21:108:542:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:programmes they had entered into. The nuclear explosion in May 1998 had also led to a 
4:77:5604:21:20:108:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sharp decline in donor assistance. This situation was worsened by the impact of the Asian 
4:78:5694:20:33:108:218:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial crisis (AFC). 
4:79:5717:33:21:144:542:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The Musharraf  government used the period under the  IMF programme to bring 
4:80:5793:21:21:108:542:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in a  number  of  important  reforms  covering  the  financial  sector,  monetary  management, 
4:81:5888:21:20:108:543:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  taxation  reforms.  The  economy  rebounded  as  business  confidence  increased  with 
4:82:5980:20:21:108:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  growth  climbing  to  9  percent  in  2004-05  from  just  2 
4:83:6074:21:21:108:543:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent  in 2000-2001.Total  investment  at  around  20  percent  of  GDP  in  2004-05  also 
4:84:6167:21:20:108:543:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:became more respectable, though domestic savings continued to remain low (around 8-10 
4:85:6253:20:33:108:424:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent of GDP) with the gap being made up by foreign savings.  
4:86:6316:33:21:144:543:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  growth  momentum,  however  could not  be  sustained  as  the  very  forces  that 
4:87:6403:21:20:108:543:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had  helped  propel  the  economy  post-2001  were  also  in  many  ways  responsible  for 
4:88:6494:20:21:108:542:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bringing  to  an  end  the  boom  which  peaked  in  2004-05.  Cheap  money  supply  led  to  a 
4:89:6590:21:21:108:543:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:monetary  overhang  (Janjua,  2005)  that  fuelled  inflation and  the  rise  in  oil  prices  stoked 
4:90:6691:21:21:108:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  further.  In  the  face  of  rising  inflation  and  increasing  oil  imports  (cheap  credit 
4:91:6796:21:20:108:542:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had  led  to  large  increases  in  sales  of  energy–intensive  products  like  automobiles, 
4:92:6890:20:21:108:542:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:motorcycles, air-conditioners etc.) the government began to put brakes by raising interest 
4:93:6981:21:33:108:293:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates and reducing the money supply.  
4:94:7016:33:20:144:542:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  unprecedented  increase  in  global  oil  and  food  prices  that  followed  in  2007 
4:95:7107:20:21:108:543:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:put  the  Musharraf  government  in  a  quandary  as  macroeconomic  imbalances  started  to 
4:96:7200:21:0:108:543:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:build up and economic activity took a sharp hit in a context of rising political instability. 
5:97:7294:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:By March 2008, when the new government took office, the economy had slid into a full 
5:98:7379:21:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:blown  crisis  with  ballooning  fiscal  and  current  account  deficits,  sharply  rising  inflation, 
5:99:7482:21:20:108:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  dwindling  foreign  exchange  reserves, which  were  fast  depleting  by  almost  US$1 
5:100:7573:20:21:108:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:billion a month with total reserves at around US$16 billion. With the economic situation 
5:101:7662:21:21:108:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fast deteriorating, the new government was left with no option but to seek the support of 
5:102:7752:21:21:108:542:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the IMF and signed a Stand-By-Arrangement in November 2008. The key elements of the 
5:103:7834:21:20:108:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stabilisation programme were a reduction in fiscal deficit including through cuts in public 
5:104:7926:20:21:108:542:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spending,  a  tight  monetary  policy  with  a  200  basis  point  increase  in  interest  rates  to  15 
5:105:8031:21:21:108:542:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent,  and a flexible  exchange  rate  regime  which  resulted  in  a  twenty-five  percent 
5:106:8126:21:20:108:543:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depreciation of the rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar. But in spite of these stabilisation efforts 
5:107:8220:20:21:108:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Pakistan was  not able  to  lift  itself  out  of  stagflation  due  to  a  combination  of  factors, 
5:108:8320:21:21:108:543:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including policy slippages, the most notable being the lack of coordination between fiscal 
5:109:8411:21:21:108:540:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and monetary policies, the inability to introduce key structural reforms including the non-
5:110:8502:21:20:108:543:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implementation  of  the  reformed  General  Sales  Tax  (GST),  security  problems,  and 
5:111:8591:20:33:108:241:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crippling energy shortages. 
5:112:8618:33:33:108:372:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Impact of the global recession and policy responses 
5:113:8669:33:20:144:543:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  GFC  came  at  a  time  when  the  economy  was  already  under  stress  due  to  the 
5:114:8760:20:21:108:543:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:terms  of  trade  shock  resulting  from  the  global  food  and  fuel  price  hikes.  The  GFC 
5:115:8856:21:21:108:543:312:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:amplified Pakistan’s economic difficulties with a marked slowdown in economic growth 
5:116:8941:21:20:108:543:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coupled with a sharp rise in the current account and fiscal deficits, a spike in inflation, the 
5:117:9037:20:21:108:542:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depletion  of  foreign  exchange  reserves, and  pressure  on the domestic  currency. As  a 
5:118:9128:21:21:108:542:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:result,  economic  growth  witnessed  a  sharp  downturn  from  an  average  of  7.3  percent 
5:119:9222:21:21:108:543:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:during  2004-07  to  3.7  percent  in  2008,  further  slowing  down  to  1.7 percent in  2009  as 
5:120:9320:21:32:108:408:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:private investment took a hit on heightened security concerns. 
5:121:9381:32:21:144:542:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:With   the   external   accounts already   under   strain,   Pakistan   experienced a 
5:122:9466:21:21:108:543:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deterioration in the current account balance, which widened to 9 percent of GDP in 2008 
5:123:9551:21:20:108:543:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and put pressure on the domestic currency. This was accompanied by a sharp rise in the 
5:124:9637:20:21:108:543:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal deficit from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2008, as public 
5:125:9723:21:0:108:543:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenues dwindled with a slowdown in economic growth. In an effort to curtail the fiscal 
6:126:9812:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deficit  and  being  unable  to  cut  sticky  current  expenditures,  the  brunt  fell  on  the  public 
6:127:9916:21:21:108:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector  development  programme, which  fell  from  nearly  5  percent  of  GDP  to  less  than  2 
6:128:10013:21:20:108:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent – with  adverse  consequences  for  long  term  competitiveness  and  productivity. 
6:129:10103:20:21:108:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:High  fiscal  deficits  financed  through  borrowings  from  the  State  Bank,  coupled  with a 
6:130:10198:21:21:108:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tight  monetary  policy,  led  to  crowding  out  of  private  investment  in  a  high  interest  rate 
6:131:10301:21:21:108:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environment. Due mainly to a lack of coordination between fiscal and monetary policies, 
6:132:10389:21:20:108:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  tight  monetary  policy  failed  to  curb  inflationary  pressures  in  the  economy,  and  the 
6:133:10490:20:21:108:543:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  touched an  all-time  high  of  20  percent  in  September  2008.  Though  it  fell 
6:134:10584:21:21:108:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subsequently  to  nearly  12  percent,  it  remained in  double  digit until  the  second  half  of 
6:135:10684:21:32:108:138:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2012. 
6:136:10689:32:21:144:543:490:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Pakistan’s  policy  response  to  the  crisis  was  largely  dictated  by  the  IMF 
6:137:10773:21:21:108:542:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:programme, under  which  Pakistan  was  committed  to  adopt  tight  monetary  and  fiscal 
6:138:10863:21:21:108:543:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policies  to  restore  macroeconomic  stability.  In  response  to  sharply  rising  inflation,  the 
6:139:10964:21:20:108:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:monetary  policy  was  considerably  tightened, which  hurt  private  investment though  its 
6:140:11055:20:21:108:542:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact  on inflation  remained  muted  as  the  latter  was  driven  as  much  by  supply 
6:141:11145:21:21:108:542:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bottlenecks  as by demand  pressures  due  to  heavy  government  borrowing.  The  IMF 
6:142:11232:21:20:108:543:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agreement  also  required  a  sharp  reduction  in  fiscal  deficits  from  7.4  percent  of  GDP  in 
6:143:11334:20:21:108:543:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2008-2009 to 4.2 percent in 2009-2010 and further to 3.3 percent in 2010-2011. The tight 
6:144:11421:21:21:108:543:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal  and  monetary  policies  dictated  by  the  IMF  left  little  space  for  macroeconomic 
6:145:11518:21:33:108:409:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adjustments needed to revive the process of economic growth. 
6:146:11578:33:32:108:176:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Key findings 
6:147:11590:32:21:144:543:238:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:Based  on  the  foregoing  discussion, three key findings emerge. First Pakistan’s 
6:148:11673:21:21:108:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  was  vulnerable  to  external  economic  shocks  due  to  its  initial  conditions, 
6:149:11765:21:20:108:543:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including  macroeconomic  and  structural  imbalances  that  acted  as  shock  amplifiers. 
6:150:11856:20:21:108:543:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second,  despite  contractionary  policies  prescribed  under  the  IMF  programme,  Pakistan 
6:151:11950:21:21:108:543:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:failed   to   address   macroeconomic   imbalances   due   mainly   to   poor   macroeconomic 
6:152:12044:21:20:108:543:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management.  Third,  the  impact  of  the  financial  crisis  was  considerably  mitigated  due 
6:153:12140:20:21:108:542:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mainly  to  some  shock  absorbers  in  the  economy, including  a  sound  financial  system, 
6:154:12233:21:0:108:500:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reliance on consumption rather than exports, and a healthy inflow of remittances. 
7:155:12314:0:21:144:542:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:Pakistan’s  vulnerability  to  external  economic  shocks  stemmed  from a high 
7:156:12394:21:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concentration of exports in cotton and textiles, heavy reliance on external financing, high 
7:157:12486:21:20:108:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current  account  deficits coupled  with  a  de  facto  open  capital  account,  low  foreign 
7:158:12579:20:21:108:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  reserves  and a weakening  domestic  currency.  All  these  factors  combined  to 
7:159:12671:21:21:108:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:make Pakistan especially prone to cuts in external financing and a slack in global demand 
7:160:12761:21:33:108:263:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for cotton and textiles products. 
7:161:12794:33:20:144:543:572:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Though Pakistan’s macroeconomic policy response was constrained by the IMF 
7:162:12869:20:21:108:543:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:programme, poor economic management was largely responsible for the failure to correct 
7:163:12956:21:21:108:543:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:macroeconomic  imbalances, which  continued  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  revival  of  economic 
7:164:13050:21:20:108:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth.  First,  overdependence  on  monetary  policy  to  contain  the  inflationary  pressures 
7:165:13147:20:21:108:543:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was  a  mistake.  While  a  tight  monetary  policy  stance  failed  to  curb  inflation,  it  hurt  the 
7:166:13252:21:21:108:543:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth process by stifling private investment on the back of high interest rates. Inflation 
7:167:13343:21:21:108:543:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remained  stubborn  as  it  was  driven  by  high  fiscal  deficits  and  supply  bottlenecks, 
7:168:13437:21:20:108:543:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including  unprecedented  power  shortages  that  crippled  economic  activity.  Second, the 
7:169:13530:20:21:108:542:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal  policy   response   was  insufficient,  especially   revenue   generation,  and  mainly 
7:170:13626:21:33:108:542:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resulted in cuts in development expenditure that were critical to sustain economic growth. 
7:171:13716:33:20:144:543:353:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Given Pakistan’s adverse initial conditions, the impact of the crisis would have 
7:172:13797:20:21:108:543:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been  much  greater had  it  not  been  for some  shock  absorbers that helped  contain  the 
7:173:13890:21:21:108:543:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fallout  from  the  crisis.  First,  a  sound  financial  system  that  was  largely  insulated  from 
7:174:13992:21:20:108:543:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:global  financial  upheavals  helped  limit  the  transmission  of  financial  shocks  to  the 
7:175:14087:20:21:108:542:271:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:domestic  economy.  Second,  Pakistan’s reliance on domestic  consumption rather than 
7:176:14173:21:21:108:543:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exports  provided  a  cushion  to  the  domestic  economy  against  a  slump  in  demand  in  the 
7:177:14271:21:21:108:543:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:west.  Third,  Pakistan  continued  to  receive  healthy  inflow  of  remittances  that  provided  a 
7:178:14372:21:32:108:314:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:critical support to its balance of payments. 
7:179:14416:32:21:144:543:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The above discussion also helps to explain why Pakistan was unable to deflect the 
7:180:14498:21:21:108:542:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crisis, as was done by its South Asian neighbours – most notably India and Bangladesh. 
7:181:14582:21:20:108:543:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The initial conditions in both India and Bangladesh were much healthier than in Pakistan. 
7:182:14672:20:21:108:543:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  macroeconomic  situation  in  both  the  countries  was  characterised  by  robust  growth, 
7:183:14769:21:0:108:543:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:low fiscal deficits, low inflation, and comfortable current account and reserves positions. 
8:184:14861:0:21:108:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The strong macroeconomic fundamentals not only enabled these economies to withstand 
8:185:14945:21:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  external  shocks  but  also  provided  them  the  necessary  policy  space  to  counter  the 
8:186:15043:21:33:108:295:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potential adverse impacts of the crisis. 
8:187:15083:33:32:108:216:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Concluding remarks 
8:188:15101:32:21:144:543:602:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  most  pressing  challenge  facing  Pakistan  today  is  to  break  out  of  the  current 
8:189:15195:21:21:108:542:581:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prolonged spell of stagflation. At the same time, there is a need to reduce vulnerability to 
8:190:15288:21:20:108:543:560:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:emerging  pressures  on  the  balance  of  payments, especially  when the global  economic 
8:191:15378:20:21:108:543:540:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outlook continues  to  be uncertain  with  the  United  States  (US)  still  in  a  phase  of  slow 
8:192:15478:21:21:108:542:519:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recovery  and  the  euro  zone  taking  a  hit  on  account  of  the  debt  crisis  of  some  of  its 
8:193:15580:21:32:108:158:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:members. 
8:194:15588:32:21:144:543:466:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Pakistan  has  endured  a  series  of  supply  shocks  resulting  from  consecutive  floods, 
8:195:15681:21:21:108:542:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unprecedented energy shortages, and a difficult domestic security situation. Consequently, 
8:196:15772:21:21:108:543:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic  growth  remains  below  potential  and  is  unlikely  to  pick  up  unless  reforms  are 
8:197:15871:21:20:108:543:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:undertaken   to   remove   supply   side   bottlenecks, especially   the   alleviation   of   energy 
8:198:15971:20:21:108:543:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shortages. Recent research (Malik, 2012) has shown that the roots of the energy crisis lie in 
8:199:16065:21:21:108:542:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:poor  governance, indicating  that  the  problem  can  be  mitigated  to  a  significant  extent  by 
8:200:16166:21:20:108:543:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bringing  about  improved  economic  management  in  the  energy  sector.  Pakistan  needs  to 
8:201:16261:20:21:108:542:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:grow at 7-8 percent per annum to provide employment opportunities to its growing labour 
8:202:16349:21:21:108:543:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:force, and this is possible only if structural reforms are undertaken to put the economy on a 
8:203:16443:21:32:108:468:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher growth trajectory on a sustained basis (Planning Commission, 2011). 
8:204:16517:32:21:144:543:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Tackling inflation is another important challenge. Although inflation has moderated 
8:205:16601:21:21:108:542:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  the  recent  period,  inflationary  pressures  persist, especially  at  a  time  when  domestic  oil 
8:206:16705:21:21:108:543:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prices  have  increased  and  domestic  currency  has  weakened  considerably.  On  the  external 
8:207:16803:21:20:108:543:184:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:front, with weakening exports, Pakistan’s balance of payments have come under pressures 
8:208:16891:20:21:108:543:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  are likely  to  intensify  as  loan  repayments  to  the  IMF  become  due.  Worse  still,  the 
8:209:16993:21:21:108:543:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:global  economic  outlook  does  not  present  a  very  optimistic  scenario  as  the  US  is  still 
8:210:17094:21:20:108:542:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:struggling  to  recover  while  the  euro  zone  is  mired  in  a  fast  spreading  debt  crisis  that 
8:211:17197:20:21:108:543:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:threatens  the  very  survival  of  the  euro  itself.  In  this  scenario,  deft  macroeconomic 
8:212:17294:21:0:108:514:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management would be required to protect the economy from adverse external shocks. 
9:213:17375:0:21:144:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To  move  the  Pakistan  economy  out  of  the  maelstrom requires  a  three-pronged 
9:214:17460:21:21:108:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:strategy  focussed  on  macroeconomic  management,  structural  reforms,  and  drivers  of 
9:215:17551:21:32:108:200:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economic growth.  
9:216:17567:32:21:144:543:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:First, prudent macroeconomic management is essential to put the economy on the 
9:217:17646:21:21:108:543:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:path  of  sustainable  growth.  There  is  an  urgent  need for  a  better  coordination  between 
9:218:17744:21:21:108:543:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal and monetary policies to restore macroeconomic balance and secure price stability. 
9:219:17834:21:20:108:543:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Though  government  borrowing  from  the  central  bank  has  been  curtailed  in  recent 
9:220:17924:20:21:108:542:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:months,  the  government  has  resorted  to  borrowing  from the  commercial  banks  that  are 
9:221:18018:21:21:108:543:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accompanied  by  massive  liquidity  injections  by  the  central  bank.  This  practice  tends  to 
9:222:18118:21:20:108:543:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crowd out private investment while making it difficult for the monetary policy to control 
9:223:18208:20:21:108:542:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the rate of inflation. Also, there is a need to carefully calibrate monetary policy to balance 
9:224:18302:21:33:108:369:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the objectives of price stability and economic growth. 
9:225:18356:33:21:144:543:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second, Pakistan has been unable to implement key structural reforms due mainly 
9:226:18436:21:20:108:542:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to a lack of political consensus. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a consensus 
9:227:18529:20:21:108:543:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on  reforms  paving  the  way  for  the  implementation  of  much  needed  reforms  in  all 
9:228:18621:21:21:108:540:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:segments  of  the  economy  especially  resource  mobilisation,  restructuring  of  the  state-
9:229:18716:21:20:108:542:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:owned enterprises, and the energy sector. In particular, the inability of the government to 
9:230:18808:20:21:108:543:333:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:raise sufficient revenues has been the root cause of Pakistan’s economic troubles and 
9:231:18894:21:21:108:543:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there is thus an urgent need for reforms in the taxation system including the introduction 
9:232:18985:21:20:108:540:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  Reformed  GST,  removal  of  poorly  targeted  subsidies,  and restructuring  of  the  state-
