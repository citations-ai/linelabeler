2:36:2183:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Between  1999  and  2004  Switzerland  opened  its  border  region  (BR)  to  cross-border  workers 
2:37:2283:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:(CBW), who are foreign residents commuting to Switzerland for work. In this paper, we exploit 
2:38:2376:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:the   timing of   implementation   and   the   fact   that   CBW   commute   almost   exclusively   to 
2:39:2478:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:municipalities close to the border to estimate the effect of this policy on foreign labor supply and 
2:40:2578:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:on native labor market outcomes, using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that opening 
2:41:2674:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:the  border  to  CBW  increased  their employment  within  20  minutes  of  commuting  time  from  the 
2:42:2776:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:border by four to five percentage points. The increased inflow was constituted of highly-educated 
2:43:2873:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:workers  and  it  was  associated  with  an  increase in  wages  for  highly-educated  Swiss  workers. 
2:44:2975:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:Native  highly-educated  workers  became  more  likely to  fill  top  managerial  positions  after  the 
2:45:3078:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:liberalization. Moreover, we find increases in wages, employment and firm-creation, especially in 
2:46:3175:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:high-skilled  manufacturing  and  knowledge-intensive  services,  which help  explain  the  positive 
2:47:3275:14:42:72:290:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:wage effects of CBW on high skilled natives.

3:64:3637:0:33:70:183:774:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1    Introduction
3:65:3654:33:22:70:524:741:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Some politicians in European countries are reconsidering their commitment to the free mobility
3:66:3748:22:22:70:524:719:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of workers within the European Union (EU), saying that immigration from the rest of Europe
3:67:3838:22:22:70:523:697:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has harmed the labor market opportunities of their native workers.1Free mobility of workers,
3:68:3930:22:22:70:524:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:however,  means more opportunities for businesses to hire a wider variety of skills.  This may
3:69:4024:22:22:70:524:653:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stimulate productivity and growth, offsetting the consequences of labor market competition so
3:70:4117:22:22:70:392:631:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that employment and wage effects for natives need not be negative.
3:71:4183:22:21:87:524:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Rarely have economists been able to study the consequences of a policy that permanently
3:72:4270:21:22:70:524:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and completely opened labor market access to foreign workers.  This is what we do in this paper.
3:73:4366:22:22:70:524:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We consider the case of Switzerland, which–progressively, between 1999 and 2007–granted EU
3:74:4456:22:22:70:524:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:citizens free access to its labor markets.  In particular, we focus on a group of foreign workers
3:75:4553:22:22:70:524:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who  were  granted  free  access  first.   These  “cross-border  workers”  (CBW)  of  Switzerland  are
3:76:4655:22:22:70:524:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:residents of the bordering countries (Italy,  Germany,  Austria and France) and are allowed to
3:77:4749:22:22:70:524:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work in Switzerland, commuting from their countries of residence.  Agreements regulating the
3:78:4841:22:22:70:524:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:flow of CBW date back to the first part of the 20th century, when Swiss employers could hire
3:79:4933:22:22:70:524:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them if no Swiss resident was found to fill a job opening.  Beginning in 1999, with the signing of
3:80:5031:22:22:70:524:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the bilateral agreement for free labor mobility with the EU, the constraints on Swiss employers
3:81:5126:22:22:70:524:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to hire CBW were progressively reduced.  In the border regions limitations to hire CBW were
3:82:5217:22:22:70:524:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fully abolished in 2004; in 2007 the other categories of EU immigrants were granted full labor
3:83:5311:22:22:70:524:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:market access in Switzerland.  Despite mounting discontent, full access of CBW to Swiss labor
3:84:5404:22:21:70:235:324:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:markets has persisted to this day.2
3:85:5439:21:22:87:524:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The policy events affecting CBW in Switzerland are useful as a case-study of a policy that
3:86:5529:22:22:70:524:281:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:permanently  and  fullyremoved legal barriers to labor market access for foreign labor.  There
3:87:5623:22:22:70:524:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are important advantages and some caveats in studying this CBW liberalization with an eye
3:88:5712:22:22:70:524:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  the  identification  of  its  labor  market  impact.   First,  the  liberalization  policy  had  a  clear
3:89:5821:22:22:70:524:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pre-event period.  Before 1999 it was not even clear that Switzerland would have pursued free
3:90:5914:22:22:70:524:193:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mobility with the EU. During this period there were several restrictions on CBW. It also had a
3:91:6008:22:22:70:524:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:clear post-implementation period, beginning in 2004, when full liberalization of CBW (in Border
3:92:6103:22:22:70:524:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regions) was allowed.  1999-2004 was a transitional period in which a gradual but still limited
3:93:6198:22:16:70:450:127:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:liberalization took place, and expectations of complete liberalization developed.
3:94:6279:16:11:83:524:111:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:1Following these type of fears, British citizens voted, on June 23rd 2016, to leave the EU (the so-called “Brexit”)
3:95:6394:11:14:83:524:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:2The Ticino region of Switzerland voted a measure in September 2016, to limit again the movement of CBW.
3:96:6498:14:11:70:524:86:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:That measure will not become law if it is not approved by the federal government.  See “The Parable of Ticino”
3:97:6608:11:0:70:242:75:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:in The Economist (2016), September 24th.
4:98:6649:0:22:87:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, as CBW commute to work from abroad–and most of them commute daily–the pol-
4:99:6731:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:icy  generated  increased  availability  of  CBW  prevalently  in  regions  very  close  to  the  border.
4:100:6836:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Employment of CBW sharply drops with distance from the border, as we will show.  In loca-
4:101:6925:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions beyond 30 minutes of driving distance from the border, their numbers were and remained
4:102:7017:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:negligible throughout the considered period.  This creates a natural framework for a difference-
4:103:7113:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in-difference analysis:  If we compare labor markets very close to the border (treatment group)
4:104:7208:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with those farther away but similar (control group) before and after the liberalization policy,
4:105:7303:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  can  identify  a  causal  effect  of  the  policy  provided  that  the  control  group  is  a  reasonable
4:106:7412:22:22:70:305:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“counterfactual” for the “treated municipalities”.
4:107:7462:22:21:87:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Third, while one could be concerned with the external validity of the estimated effects, two
4:108:7554:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:features make it especially interesting.  As with other immigrants, because CBW are employed
4:109:7646:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Switzerland they constitute additional labor supply, but because they live abroad they likely
4:110:7742:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:generate  smaller  local  consumption/demand  effects  compared  to  other  immigrants.   As  they
4:111:7840:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spend a large portion of their incomes in their countries of residence, several demand-side effects–
4:112:7940:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  example,  on  local  housing  prices  (e.g.   Saiz,  2003)  and  on  local  demand  for  non-tradable
4:113:8046:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consumption  goods  (e.g.   Hong  and  McLaren,  2015)–are  almost  certainly  weaker.   Hence  the
4:114:8145:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:starkest  effects  of  this  policy  should  be  on  labor  demand  for  native  workers.   Moreover,  this
4:115:8252:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy  change  was  perceived  as  producing  a  permanent  increase  in  the  share  of  foreign-born
4:116:8355:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers in areas close to the border.  This is in contrast to the temporary push-driven surges in
4:117:8452:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:immigrants (such as the Mariel Boatlift in Miami or the outflows from Russia to Israel at the
4:118:8545:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:end of the cold war), and can provide particular insight into the long-run effects of permanently
4:119:8642:22:22:70:216:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changing immigration policies.
4:120:8672:22:21:87:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The main findings of this paper are the following:  First, the full liberalization of CBW in
4:121:8764:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Switzerland (starting in 2004) produced an increase of cross-border workers equal to between four
4:122:8861:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and five percentage points of total employment in municipalities within a 10 minute commute
4:123:8952:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the border (treated group) relative to those farther than a 30 minute commute from the
4:124:9043:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:border (control).  Municipalities within 10 to 20 minutes of commuting time (treated but not
4:125:9135:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as intensely) experienced an increase of about 2 to 3 percentage points of the labor force, while
4:126:9232:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:municipalities between 20 and 30 minutes of commuting time from the border experienced less
4:127:9323:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than  a  one  percentage  point  change.   There  is  mild,  not  statistically  significant  evidence  of
4:128:9429:22:22:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an increase in CBW during the transitional 1999-2004 period; the increase became larger and
4:129:9520:22:22:70:524:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statistically significant only after the full liberalization of 2004. We also document that the inflow
4:130:9622:22:0:70:524:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of CBW was strongly concentrated among highly- and middle-educated workers.  Low-educated
5:131:9712:0:22:70:357:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW showed no increase, and possibly a decline after 1999.
5:132:9770:22:22:87:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second,  looking  at  the  impact  on  wages  and  employment  of  native  workers,  we  find  that
5:133:9869:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:native Swiss workers with tertiary education within 10 minutes from the border experienced a
5:134:9961:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(statistically) significant positive wage change after full liberalization in 2004.  Primary-educated
5:135:10062:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers experienced a less significant increase in employment and total hours worked, instead.
5:136:10156:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The changes of wages and hours worked by secondary-educated workers in the 10- minute com-
5:137:10246:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:muting area were not significant. As the change in CBW represented an inflow of highly-educated
5:138:10341:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers, the wage increase of highly-educated natives cannot be rationalized by a simple model
5:139:10435:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of a pure supply shift with high and low skilled labor and no demand changes (such as Goldin
5:140:10527:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Katz (2008) or Borjas (2003)).  Hence we document several channels that show adjustment
5:141:10618:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in native occupations,  and increases in productivity and firm creation,  which may rationalize
5:142:10713:22:22:70:130:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these effects.
5:143:10727:22:22:87:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One  important  adjustment  channel  is  that  highly-educated  native  workers  responded  to
5:144:10821:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the increase of CBW by taking new managerial positions and climbing the managerial ladder.
5:145:10911:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Another sign of a positive productivity/investment effects is that we find strong positive wage
5:146:11006:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and employment changes in high tech manufacturing and human capital intensive sectors, which
5:147:11098:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employ most high skilled workers.  We also find some evidence of stronger firm creation closer
5:148:11192:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the border.  This implies capital investment and sectoral reallocation that is consistent with
5:149:11289:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the complementarity of highly-educated CBW with capital and highly-educated native workers.
5:150:11380:22:22:87:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While rigorous analysis of the short- and long-run effects of important immigration policy
5:151:11470:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes are rare, two recent papers exploit changes in policies on cross-border workers to learn
5:152:11566:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about  the  effects  of  foreign  labor  supply  and  are  closely  related  to  this  paper.   Dustmann,
5:153:11671:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Sch ̈onberg and Stuhler (2017) analyzes the opening of Germany’s border to Czech cross-border
5:154:11764:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers in June 1991.  Between 1991 and 1993, employment of Czech workers increased strongly
5:155:11856:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in areas close to the border.  The paper tracks the effect on employment and wages of natives.
5:156:11950:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:After 1993, the policy was de-facto withdrawn and a corresponding decrease in the number of
5:157:12041:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Czech workers took place.  The paper analyzes the short-run impact of such temporary shocks
5:158:12132:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in a difference-in-difference set-up.  It finds a strong, negative effect on employment of natives
5:159:12230:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  a  more  moderate,  negative  effect  on  wages.   The  negative  effect  on  native  employment
5:160:12331:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  mainly  due  to  smaller  inflows  of  natives  from  other  regions  of  Germany.   The  authors  use
5:161:12437:22:22:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance from the Czech-German border as a determinant of the intensity of the supply shock
5:162:12528:22:22:70:524:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(treatment)  and  compare  native  outcomes  in  treated  and  matched  regions  farther  from  the
5:163:12627:22:0:70:524:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:border.   Importantly,  the  episode  they  study  wastemporary,  as  the  policy  was  only  in  place
6:164:12731:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for two years, and cross-border workers were mainlylow-skilled.  It took place in a historically
6:165:12827:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extraordinary period, when the economy of the Czech Republic was depressed and undergoing
6:166:12916:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a major transition, right after the fall of the Communist regime.  Several features of the Swiss
6:167:13012:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:context and policy stand in contrast to the German one.  Its early announcement, its phased-in
6:168:13106:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implementation and predictability, and the fact that immigrants were mostly high-skilled, plus
6:169:13200:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  longer-run  perspective  of  the  policy  and  of  our  analysis,  make  this  case  more  similar  to
6:170:13307:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:standard change in immigration policies.  These factors may also help explain the more positive
6:171:13402:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage and employment effects for native workers that we find relative to Dustmann, Sch ̈onberg
6:172:13495:22:22:70:163:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Stuhler (2017).
6:173:13514:22:21:87:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In another paper, most closely related to ours and written concurrently, Ruffner and Siegen-
6:174:13606:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thaler (2016) present complementary results on the impact of the same liberalization episode in
6:175:13701:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Switzerland on firms’ outcomes.  Using a difference-in-difference identification strategy similar
6:176:13798:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to ours, they show that the policy had a positive impact on the R&D and innovation activity
6:177:13889:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of firms, and that positive productivity effects were concentrated in firms that used CBW more
6:178:13983:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensively.  We discuss their results in greater detail below, as well as how they compare to and
6:179:14081:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:complement ours.  The focus of our paper is to document the validity of the policy experiment,
6:180:14175:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and to characterize the dynamics and the channels through which immigration affected wages,
6:181:14266:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment, and regional- and occupational-mobility of natives.  In particular, we consider the
6:182:14361:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:internal migration dynamics and the sector- and skill-specific responses of Swiss workers to the
6:183:14457:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opening of the border.  In contrast, Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) use a firm-level database to
6:184:14554:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:analyze the impact of the policy on domestic firms’ outcomes, showing important evidence of
6:185:14645:22:22:70:335:313:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:effects on productivity, R&D and patented innovation.3
6:186:14699:22:21:87:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Evaluating the impact of specific policy changes is a step forward in the literature on the
6:187:14790:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor market effects of immigrants.  Most studies perform panel regression analysis exploiting
6:188:14884:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:area variation of immigrants.  Often, however, these studies lack a strong identification strategy,
6:189:14983:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:so  the  results  can  only  be  interpreted  as  partial  correlations.   Some  of  the  most  prominent
6:190:15088:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:papers in the literature are summarized in Blau and Kahn (2012), Lewis and Peri (2014), and
6:191:15179:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Longhi, Nijkamp and Poot (2005).  Apart from these, only a few recent papers have analyzed
6:192:15269:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific immigration policy changes and their impact on economic outcomes.  Kerr and Lincoln

7:201:16134:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on undocumented immigrant labor market performance.  For Europe, Glitz (2012) analyzed the
7:202:16224:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect  of  a  policy  allowing  ethnic  Germans  in  Eastern  Europe  to  obtain  German  citizenship,
7:203:16327:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which generated–in combination with the fall of the iron curtain–a sudden inflow of migrants.

7:207:16704:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects after the refugee inflow.  A handful of additional papers tried to measure immigration
7:208:16798:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policies and estimate the effect of policy changes on immigrant inflows in a multi-country gravity

7:211:17084:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10,000 to 15,000 individuals annually.  Beerli, Indergand and Kunz (2017) show that the increase
7:212:17180:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the positive selection of newly-arriving immigrants is mostly driven by long-run shifts in the
7:213:17277:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:demand for skills triggered by skill-biased technology, rather than by immigration policies.  Our
7:214:17374:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:paper is new in that it identifies the effect of a major and permanent policy change, and evaluates
7:215:17473:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:its consequences on the number and type of immigrant flows and the ensuing effects on local

7:219:17786:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Section 3.1 and 3.2 describe the main data sources and the key trends relative to the supply
7:220:17878:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of cross-border workers and resident immigrant workers, and shows summary statistics of de-

7:222:18072:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specifications and section 4 presents the estimates of the impact of border liberalization on the
7:223:18169:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:supply of CBW. Section 5 analyzes the consequences on key labor market outcomes for natives
7:224:18260:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such as wages, employment, and hours worked.  Section 6 inquires into possible channels, dy-
7:225:18352:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:namic transitions, and heterogeneous effects triggered by opening the border to CBW. We also

7:228:18568:32:22:70:524:104:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The process of opening the Swiss labor market to European Union citizens started with the sign-
7:229:18663:22:22:70:524:82:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ing of the bilateral agreements between the EU and Switzerland on June 21, 1999.  Before 1999
7:230:18756:22:0:70:524:60:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:there was not even a clear expectation about the possibility of free mobility between Switzer-
8:231:18851:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:land and Europe.  The main piece of this bilateral Agreement focused on the Free Movement of
8:232:18943:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Persons (AFMP), i.e.  full bilateral access to each other’s labor markets.  In an announcement by
8:233:19040:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the federal administration in 1999, it became clear that cross-border workers would be the first
8:234:19136:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group to benefit from a phase-in of the liberalization reform (Bundesrat, 1999).  Yet the exact
8:235:19231:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implementation of the liberalization remained uncertain since the bilateral agreements had to
8:236:19324:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:go through a ratification process in all EU member states and through a national referendum
8:237:19415:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Switzerland.  This took place in May 2000, and the agreement was approved with 67.2% of
8:238:19505:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:votes.  On June 1, 2002, the AFMP was enacted, 1.5 years after the target date that was initially
8:239:19602:22:22:70:124:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:announced.
8:240:19612:22:21:87:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The AFMP was part of larger bilateral package of agreements aimed at reducing the “in-
8:241:19698:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stitutional and economic isolation” of Switzerland that may have resulted from the rejection of
8:242:19793:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the European Economic Area membership in 1992 in a national referendum.4At the beginning
8:243:19881:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the negotiations in 1993 that led to these agreements, the Swiss government tried to avoid a
8:244:19976:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:full-fledged version of free worker mobility.  This position was rooted in the concern that neither
8:245:20075:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Swiss border cantons nor the population as a whole would accept a broad mandate since they
8:246:20169:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rejected joining the EEA largely due to fears of immigration from the rest of Europe.  As the EU
8:247:20265:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:insisted on full free mobility, a breakthrough in the negotiations was only reached when both
8:248:20358:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parties agreed that the full free mobility would be implemented step-wise and included further
8:249:20452:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:safety measures that the Swiss could trigger unilaterally, if necessary (Bundesrat, 1999).5These
8:250:20548:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:political circumstances and the fact that the federal government, and not Cantons, negotiated
8:251:20641:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the AFMP agreements, imply that the local economic conditions of border municipalities were
8:252:20732:22:22:70:379:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not a consideration in the timing and content of the agreements.
8:253:20796:22:21:87:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:A:The  group  ofcross-border  workers(CBW)  enjoyed  a  special  status  in  theborder  region
8:254:20888:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(BR).6Prior to 1999,  firms were allowed to hire CBW if no equally qualified resident worker
8:255:20980:22:17:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:could be found for a given job (the so-called “priority requirement”).7Moreover, CBW could
8:256:21070:17:15:83:524:231:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:4The package of bilateral agreements also included agreements on the reduction of technical barriers to trade,
8:257:21180:15:11:70:524:216:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the  liberalization  of  trade  in  agricultural  goods,  public  procurement,  and  transport,  and  the  participation  of
8:258:21304:11:11:70:524:205:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Switzerland  in  the  EU’s  research  framework  program.   See  the  Online  Appendix  C  for  more  details  on  the
8:259:21422:11:7:70:150:194:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:bilateral agreement.
8:260:21442:7:15:83:524:187:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:5The two safety measures that the Swiss could trigger were the following.  First, the “safeguard clause” allowed
8:261:21554:15:11:70:524:172:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Switzerland to reinstate quotas on immigration temporarily, if the inflow of workers exceeded a a certain threshold.
8:262:21670:11:10:70:524:161:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Second, Switzerland could re-evaluate its bilateral agreements with the EU 7 years after implementation with a
8:263:21780:10:11:70:524:151:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:national  referendum.   Fears  of  labor  market  competition  were  voiced  after  the  AFMP  was  signed.   This  is  an
8:264:21902:11:11:70:524:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:example from a prominent newspaper at the time (Neue Z ̈urcher Zeitung, 1999, Sept.  2):“The high prevailing
8:265:22010:11:11:70:524:129:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:wage level in Switzerland raises fears of wage dumping. These concerns are particularly pronounced in the border
8:266:22122:11:8:70:472:118:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:region where the free movement of persons is expected to raise the competition in the labor market.”
8:267:22222:8:14:83:524:110:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:6Bilateral agreements on CBW were signed with Italy in 1928, with France in 1946, with Germany in 1970
8:268:22324:14:7:70:174:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and with Austria in 1973.
8:269:22349:7:15:83:524:89:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:7Firms had to provide the cantonal migration offices with details about the job requirement and the working
8:270:22456:15:11:70:524:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:conditions before hiring CBW. They also had to demonstrate to have searched unsuccessfully for a suitable Swiss
8:271:22567:11:0:70:524:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:worker.  In turn, the cantonal immigration offices checked whether there was no equally qualified resident worker
9:272:22681:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not work in thenon-border  region(NBR) of Switzerland.  The remaining foreign workers who
9:273:22770:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:resided  in  Switzerland,  which  we  simply  callimmigrants  (I),  were  subject  to  yearly  national
9:274:22873:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quotas set by the federal government and to the “priority requirement”.  Immigrants could work
9:275:22967:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:anywhere in Switzerland.  Figure 1 shows a map of Switzerland with the municipalities in the
9:276:23059:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:BR shaded in gray, while the NBR are represented in white.  The separation of municipalities
9:277:23151:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between  BR  and  NBR  does  not  overlap  with  the  cantonal  borders  (indicated  by  black  lines)
9:278:23253:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nor with other cultural characteristics of the population (e.g.  the major language areas).  The
9:279:23349:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:boundaries of the BR remained unchanged with the introduction of the free movement policy,
9:280:23439:22:22:70:400:598:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:and we use the BR definition as it was during the period 2000-2010.8
9:281:23507:22:21:87:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Between 1994 and 1999,  the status quo was as described above.  This is what we call the
9:282:23595:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:Pre-Liberalization Phase:  CBW had restricted access to the labor market in the BR, they had
9:283:23687:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to commute daily, and they could not work in the NBR. Then between June 1, 1999 and May
9:284:23774:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:31, 2004, during thetransitional phase, cantonal immigration offices in the border region gained
9:285:23870:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more discretion in allowing firms to hire CBW.9In particular, the official introduction of the
9:286:23964:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:AFMP in 2002 was an important step toward opening the border region labor market to CBW.
9:287:24052:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Their permits were no longer bound to a particular job and remained valid for five years (rather
9:288:24148:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than only one year), and applicants for CBW permits were not required to have resided in the
9:289:24240:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adjacent  border  region  of  the  neighboring  country  for  the  previous  six  months.   In  addition,
9:290:24345:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW  were  allowed  to  commute  weekly  (rather  than  daily)  and  adopt  a  secondary  residency
9:291:24444:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  Switzerland.   It  appears,  however,  that  only  a  small  fraction  of  CBW  switched  to  weekly
9:292:24548:22:22:70:523:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:commuting during our period of analysis.10As argued above, the fact that CBW work but do
9:293:24636:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not reside in Switzerland suggests a more muted impact of CBW on local consumption (housing,
9:294:24728:22:21:70:253:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:etc.)  compared to resident immigrant.
9:295:24766:21:22:87:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:On June 1, 2004 thefull  liberalizationphase (or Free movement phase) of the reform was
9:296:24853:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enacted and the labor market of BR municipalities became fully accessible to CBW who could
9:297:24943:22:20:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be  hired  by  local  firms  under  no  different  conditions  than  Swiss  workers.   CBW  still  had  no
9:298:25049:20:7:70:440:206:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:registered as unemployed.  This procedure imposed substantial costs for firms to hire CBW.
9:299:25139:7:11:83:524:199:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:8Notice that the area within 25-30 kilometers form the Swiss border is almost exclusively occupied by the BR
9:300:25247:11:15:83:524:188:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:9Conversations with representatives from cantonal immigration offices revealed there was also a more relaxed
9:301:25355:15:11:70:524:173:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:handling of new CBW applications after 1999, and particularly after the national referendum on May 21, 2000,
9:302:25463:11:7:70:488:162:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:as it was clear that eventually CBW would be the first to gain unrestricted access to the border region.
9:303:25567:7:15:79:524:155:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:10Two pieces of evidence corroborate this conjecture.  First, we collected data about the secondary residence
9:304:25676:15:11:70:524:140:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:status of CBW among top 60 municipalities where most CBW were employed in 2010 according to the Swiss cross-
9:305:25784:11:11:70:524:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:border registry.  In a sample of 20 top destinations for CBW, for which we were able to collect data (registration
9:306:25898:11:11:70:524:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:of this status is not mandatory for municipalities), less than 2% of all CBW were registered as weekly commuters
9:307:26010:11:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:by 2010.  Second,  in the sample of all CBW from Germany available in the Swiss cross-border worker register
9:308:26118:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(1996-2010) for which we were able to geo-code their (primary) place of residence abroad, 99% live in two adjacent
9:309:26232:11:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:states Baden-W ̈urttemberg or Bayern, of which 89% and 99% live within 30 and 60 minutes driving time from
9:310:26338:11:0:70:192:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the Swiss border, respectively.
10:311:26370:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:access to work in the NBR but, as we will see, given their commuting patterns, employers in
10:312:26461:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:NBR  hired  almost  no  CBW  before  or  after  full  liberalization.   This  phase  marks  the  biggest
10:313:26565:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:change in freedom of access to labor markets for cross-border workers.  Only on June 1, 2007
10:314:26657:22:22:70:507:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:did Non-Border regions adopt full liberalization for CBW and for immigrants from the EU.
10:315:26745:22:22:87:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The progressively easier access of CBW to labor markets in the border region from 1999 to
10:316:26834:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2004 generated a growing asymmetry in access to foreign labor supply between municipalities
10:317:26925:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:close to the border and those farther away.  CBW, whose concentration was largest within the
10:318:27017:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:areas closest to the border, had progressively more access to Swiss jobs after 1999 and mainly
10:319:27111:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after 2004.  Other EU immigrants to Switzerland had the same access to all labor markets in
10:320:27202:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Switzerland,  if they were admitted.  It is this spatial difference and the timing of the reform
10:321:27298:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that we use in our identification strategy.  Finally let us emphasize that the bilateral agreement
10:322:27396:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  EU  countries  allowed  Swiss  people  to  commute  across  the  border,  too.   However,  their
10:323:27498:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment in the border regions of Italy, France, and Germany did not change in a significant
10:324:27592:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:way (see Ruffner and Siegenthaler, 2016) because the wage differential was strongly in favor of
10:325:27687:22:46:70:205:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Swiss side of the border.

10:332:28211:22:22:70:524:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work identified to the zip code level.  We use this information to identify the municipalities where
10:333:28311:22:22:70:524:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals work.  Municipalities are the smaller units identified in Figure 1.12As described in
10:334:28407:22:21:70:524:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Section  2  and  shown  in  the  Figure,  each  municipality  belongs  either  to  the  BR  or  the  NBR.
10:335:28512:21:22:70:524:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To compute the shortest travel time to the national border for each municipality, we identified
10:336:28607:22:22:70:524:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:municipalities  with  a  road  border  crossing  using  data  from  Federal  Customs  Administration,
10:337:28708:22:16:70:524:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and used data on road travel time between any two municipalities from search.ch, a web search
10:338:28801:16:15:79:524:146:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:11The official title of this data set is “Bundesamt f ̈ur Statistik, Schweizerische Lohnstrukturerhebung 1994-2010”
10:339:28916:15:7:70:473:131:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(BFS, 2010).  The survey collects information on labor market variables on October 31 of each year.
10:340:29015:7:15:79:524:124:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:12We use an official crosswalk from the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) between Municipalities and zip Codes.
10:341:29125:15:11:70:524:109:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:As  the  number  of  municipalities  (and  zip  codes)  changed  over  time  due  to  mergers,  we  use  the  municipality
10:342:29247:11:11:70:524:98:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:definition in year 2000 as a time-invariant unit.  Observations with outdated zip codes that could not be linked
10:343:29359:11:11:70:524:87:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(less than 0.3%) were dropped.  We thank Maurizio Bigotta for sharing the data of border region identifiers for
10:344:29470:11:0:70:434:76:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:each Swiss municipality.  See Losa, Bigotta and Gonzales (2012) for a detailed description.

11:346:29571:22:22:87:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  sample  we  use  includes  individuals  between  18  and  65  years  of  age,  working  in  the
11:347:29671:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:private sector,  with non-missing information for nationality,  place of work,  education,  wages,
11:348:29769:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hours worked, and other basic demographics.  In the data we distinguish three types of workers
11:349:29863:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based  on  their  residency  permit.   The  first  arenative  workers–those  with  Swiss  nationality
11:350:29964:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:either born in Switzerland or naturalized; the second are foreign-born workers with a residency
11:351:30059:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:permit which we call simply immigrants (I); and finally we have cross-border workers (CBW).
11:352:30150:22:22:70:353:620:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:Combined, we denote the last two groups asforeign-born.14
11:353:30207:22:22:87:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The first and most direct outcome of the policy we analyze is the net change in the number
11:354:30297:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  cross-border  and  foreign-born  workers  as  a  share  of  total  employment.   When  we  consider
11:355:30400:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes relative to native workers in a municipality, we use the total number of hours worked
11:356:30494:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and their hourly wage as measures of their labor supply and marginal productivity, respectively.
11:357:30590:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  data  set  contains  the  gross  monthly  wage  for  each  individual  worker  (in  the  month  of
11:358:30693:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:October) in Swiss Francs.  This measure includes social transfers, bonuses, and one-twelfth of
11:359:30787:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:additional yearly payments.  We divide this measure by the number of hours worked in October,
11:360:30880:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and use the consumer price index to deflate it into thereal hourly wageof an individual worker
11:361:30974:22:22:70:523:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at 2010 constant prices.  We expresshours workedas a fraction of the number of hours worked
11:362:31065:22:22:70:407:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by a full-time worker, so that one unit is a full time equivalent (FTE).
11:363:31137:22:22:87:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  our  analysis,  we  aggregate  data  at  the  municipal  level,  constructing  the  total  number
11:364:31238:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  workers,  the  total  hours  worked,  the  average  log  hourly  wage  and  other  variables  at  that
11:365:31344:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:geographical unit.15In most of the analysis we separate outcomes by schooling group.  Edu-
11:366:31434:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cation is a key determinant of skills and productivity and hence we identify three groups,  by
11:367:31528:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level  of  schooling,  which  we  occasionally  simply  call  skill  groups.   This  three-group  partition
11:368:31635:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:augments the common one between college- and non-college-educated used in large part of the
11:369:31726:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage inequality and immigration literature (e.g.  Katz and Murphy, 1992 or Autor, Katz and
11:370:31816:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Kearney,  2008),  especially  in  the  US.  The  intermediate  level  of  schooling  is  included  to  cap-
11:371:31923:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ture the fact that in the Swiss education system people with secondary education tend to have
11:372:32016:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:technical  and  vocational  degrees,  and  not  a  high  school  diploma.   They  work  in  specialized
11:373:32119:22:16:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jobs and are likely to constitute a group of abilities which is rather differentiated from those
11:374:32215:16:15:79:524:144:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:13We thank search.ch and Andreas Steinhauer for sharing the commuting data with us.  Municipalities with a
11:375:32321:15:7:70:378:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:border crossing are assumed to have zero travel time to the national border.
11:376:32397:7:15:79:524:122:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:14The group we call immigrants hold either an L permit (4 to 12 months) or a B permit (1 to 6 years).  Cross-
11:377:32506:15:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:border workers hold a G permit.  The foreign-born individuals with a permanent residence permit (C permit) can
11:378:32616:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:be considered aslong-time immigrants.  This is a group that we do not include in our analysis as its status was
11:379:32727:11:7:70:221:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:not affected by any changes in policy.
11:380:32765:7:15:79:524:78:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:15When  analyzing  wage  outcomes  we  trim  our  sample  by  excluding  individuals  with  wages  above  the  99th
11:381:32880:15:0:70:247:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:percentile of real hourly wages in each year.
12:382:32927:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  workers  with  primary  education  only.   We  define  workers  with  tertiary  education  as  being
12:383:33031:22:22:70:523:752:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:highly-educated.  Workers with less than a college education with a secondary school diploma
12:384:33123:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are defined asmiddle-educatedand workers with only primary education, completed or not, are
12:385:33214:22:22:70:171:708:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:calledlow-educated.16
12:386:33235:22:22:87:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In section 6, we augment our data with two additional data sets in order to analyze worker
12:387:33325:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:transitions across municipalities and employment status and heterogeneous effects in different
12:388:33419:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:subgroups.  The first data set is the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS), which we use with similar
12:389:33515:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample restrictions and definitions for skill groups and geography.  This data set covers the whole
12:390:33614:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:population, including unemployed and individuals currently not in the labor force.  Information
12:391:33709:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the place of work of individuals is available yearly since 1996.  As individuals were interviewed
12:392:33809:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:repeatedly (up to five years), we can track individuals over consecutive years and analyze their
12:393:33905:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mobility in terms of location, as we do in section 6.17A second additional data set we use is the
12:394:34002:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Swiss Business Census (BC), available in 1991, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2005 and 2008.  This database
12:395:34096:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:covers the universe of public and private sector establishments in Switzerland, and reports for
12:396:34191:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each the total employment of natives and foreign workers.  This is the database mainly used by
12:397:34285:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Ruffner and Sieghentaler (2017) in their firm-level analysis.  We use it only to analyze the share
12:398:34383:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of native workers across different industries and the birth of new establishments in sections 6.3
12:399:34480:22:38:70:108:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and 6.4.
12:400:34488:38:29:70:314:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.2    Summary Statistics and Key Trends
12:401:34528:29:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The number of CBW employed in the Border Region of Switzerland increased from 7% to 9.5%
12:402:34616:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of total employment between 1998 and 2010.  Importantly, this non-negligible increase was very
12:403:34710:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unevenly distributed within the Border Region. The Border Region includes Swiss municipalities
12:404:34804:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both between 0 and 30 minutes from and those more than 30 minutes travel time from the border.
12:405:34898:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Cross Border Workers,  as we will detail below,  were almost exclusively employed,  before and
12:406:34992:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after the reforms, in municipalities between 0 and 30 minutes from the border.  We first describe
12:407:35089:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:how the characteristics of CBW compare to the characteristics of native workers.  The potential
12:408:35184:22:16:70:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor market impact of their inflow depends on their number and on their skills.  Table 1 shows
12:409:35279:16:15:79:524:165:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:16The education variable has some missing information (roughly 15% on average).  As a consistency check of all
12:410:35389:15:11:70:524:150:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:results, we alternatively classified workers into three wage tercile groups, each year, and also try splitting them
12:411:35504:11:11:70:524:139:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:into three groups using the the 24 available occupations in the SESS data to classify them into groups of high,
12:412:35615:11:11:70:524:128:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:middle and low-paying occupations.  All results that we show are similar when we use these alternative occupation
12:413:35728:11:7:70:516:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:or wage-based skill classifications.  See Appendix, Figure A3 (effect on wages) and Figure A4 (effect on hours).
12:414:35840:7:15:79:524:110:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:17We focus on individuals’ transitions between two consecutive years as most individuals are only two consecutive
12:415:35953:15:11:70:524:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:years in the panel.  Although this data set is much richer in scope than the SESS, its sample is significantly smaller,
12:416:36072:11:11:70:524:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:which implies significantly larger measurement error at the level of the municipality.  All our baseline findings
12:417:36185:11:0:70:374:73:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:based on the SESS are qualitatively similar when we use the SLFS instead.
13:418:36260:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  summary  statistics  for  the  population  of  CBW  and  native  workers  in  the  border  regions
13:419:36363:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Switzerland.  We report the characteristics of those two populations in 1998 and 2010 and,
13:420:36456:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more importantly, their change, which provides information on the net inflow of CBW relative
13:421:36548:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  natives.   Four  features  are  noteworthy.   First,  while  in  1998  the  composition  of  CBW  was
13:422:36653:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more  concentrated  among  the  less-educated  relative  to  natives  (with  33%  among  CBW  with
13:423:36751:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only primary education versus 13% of natives), the change in composition of CBW during the
13:424:36841:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:considered period was strongly toward highly-educated.  The net change 1998-2010 for CBW
13:425:36929:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implied a large increase in the share of highly educated (+12.6%) and a corresponding decline
13:426:37022:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the share of less educated (−10%, see the columns labeled “change” in Table 1).  Second, the
13:427:37117:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:net inflow of CBW was concentrated in middle and low management positions, but not in high
13:428:37207:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:management  positions  that  remained  predominantly  occupied  by  natives.   This  is  consistent
13:429:37306:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with the interpretation that CBW were highly-educated and had technical skills, but possibly
13:430:37398:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lacked the cultural skills to be at the very top management levels of Swiss companies.  Third,
13:431:37492:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their inflow between 1998 and 2010 was mainly in the intermediate and high tercile of the wage
13:432:37586:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution, confirming their high level of skills.  Finally, the sector composition of new CBW
13:433:37682:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was strongly concentrated in IT/R&D/Business/real estate and, to a lesser extent, in the Health
13:434:37777:22:22:70:418:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sector.  CBW were, in large part, professionals in science and technology.
13:435:37851:22:22:87:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our identification strategy will be based on the timing of the labor market liberalization for
13:436:37945:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW and on the difference that the policy change produced in municipalities close to the border
13:437:38040:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative to those further away.  Figure 2 shows the change in CBW which will provide the key
13:438:38132:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identifying variation in our analysis.  In the top two panels of that figure, denoted as Panel A, we
13:439:38232:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show CBW as share of total employment in municipalities grouped and arrayed from left to right
13:440:38326:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by commuting time from the national border.  The graph shows the values aggregating 5-minute
13:441:38418:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bins from 0 to 85 minutes of travel time from the border,  with 0 representing a municipality
13:442:38511:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a border crossing.  Each of the two top panels has four lines, representing the CBW share
13:443:38605:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of employment in different years.  We show the connected values for the years 1994 and 1998,
13:444:38697:22:22:70:523:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:which are before any policy change, for year 2004 which is at the end of theTransition  Phase
13:445:38790:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and at the very beginning ofFull Liberalization, and then in year 2010, which is six years after
13:446:38886:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:full liberalization.18period.  The left panel represents municipalities in the Border Region going
13:447:38984:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:up all the way to the national border.  The panel on the right represents municipalities in the
13:448:39079:22:16:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Non-Border region (NBR) and, hence, it does not include municipalities less than 35 minutes
13:449:39170:16:15:79:524:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:18In fact, the full free mobility of CBW was implemented on June 1, 2004, and the data points in the SESS
13:450:39275:15:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:represent the situation of the labor market in October 31 of a particular year.  Thus, the data point in 2004 can
13:451:39388:11:0:70:286:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:be regarded as the first year of theFull Liberalization
14:452:39445:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the border.  That panel also shows that there was a negligible number of CBW in the NBR
14:453:39537:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both before the reforms as well as in the transition and full liberalization phases.19It is clear
14:454:39634:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from these two pictures that CBW were a significant share of employment only in border regions
14:455:39728:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and, within them, only in municipalities very close to the border.  Even before the policy reform,
14:456:39826:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW  constituted  10-20%  of  employment,  but  only  in  municipalities  within  10-15  minutes  of
14:457:39926:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:commuting time from the border.  The gradient of their employment share is very steep so that
14:458:40019:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:past 30 minutes of commuting time from the border their presence, both in the BR and in the
14:459:40110:22:22:70:196:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:NBR, was essentially zero.
14:460:40136:22:22:87:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The two lower panels of Figure 2 show the smoothed net change in CBW as share of employ-
14:461:40224:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ment in 1998 for the period 1994-1998 (pre-liberalization), for the period 1998-2004 (during the
14:462:40320:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:Transitionphase), and for the period 2004-2010 (duringFull Liberalizationphase).20We notice
14:463:40411:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the 1994-1998 change is extremely small and even negative for municipalities near the bor-
14:464:40506:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:der.  The change in the period 1999-2004 is positive for municipalities between 0 and 20 minutes
14:465:40602:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the border and negligible elsewhere, and the change between 2004 and 2010 is large and
14:466:40693:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive for municipalities up to 20 minutes from the border, non-negligible but much smaller
14:467:40786:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for municipalities between 20 and 30 minutes from the border, and negligible for municipalities
14:468:40881:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with a commute to the border above 30 minutes (and exactly zero above 35-40 minutes).  Hence
14:469:40973:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it appears that most of the change associated with liberalization of CBW took place between
14:470:41064:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0 and 20 minutes from the border, with some effects up to 30 minutes.  The border-region over
14:471:41157:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:30 minutes from the border and the non-border region (represented on the right in Panel B of
14:472:41249:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 2) shows essentially no changes during theTransitionor theFull Liberalizationphases:
14:473:41340:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW did not work there even after liberalization.  The focus of our analysis, therefore, is on the
14:474:41438:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:BR. We consider the municipalities in the 0−10 and 10−20 minute bins as, respectively, most
14:475:41529:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strongly treated and strongly treated.  Those between 20 and 30 minutes are weakly treated.
14:476:41620:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The municipalities over 30 minutes are the control group.  In some robustness checks we also
14:477:41712:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:include municipalities in the non-border region in the control group.  We additionally check that
14:478:41809:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the large inflow of CBW in municipalities near the border between 2004 and 2010 was not offset
14:479:41903:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by a corresponding decrease of immigrants but,  rather,  that it resulted in a total increase of
14:480:41999:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:foreign-born workers in those regions.  This is shown in the Appendix.  In Panel B of Appendix
14:481:42093:22:16:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure  A1,  we  can  see  that,  for  the  border  regions,  the  change  in  foreign-born  as  a  share  of
14:482:42202:16:15:79:524:122:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:19For the sake of illustration, bins with a very low level of total employment are omitted from this figure, i.e.
14:483:42315:15:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:bins in the border region more than 80 minutes from the border, and bins in the non-border between 13 and 35
14:484:42423:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:minutes and above 85 minutes from the border.  In the analysis below, the sample includes all municipalities as
14:485:42534:11:7:70:109:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:indicated.
14:486:42544:7:15:79:524:78:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:20To  reduce  noise,  we  smoothed  the  change  in  CBW  as  a  share  of  total  employment  in  1998  using  a  local
14:487:42664:15:0:70:231:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:polynomial with bandwidth 10 minutes.
15:488:42703:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment mirrors the changes of CBW being zero to negative and was rather flat in the 1994-
15:489:42796:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1998 period, positive and decreasing with distance in the 1999-2003 period, and larger and with
15:490:42891:22:22:70:375:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a steeper decline away from the border in the 2004-2010 period.
15:491:42954:22:22:87:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:It is also useful to compare the economic and demographic characteristics across the three
15:492:43044:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regions (0−10, 10−20 and 20−30) that received different intensity of “treatment” (availability
15:493:43138:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of CBW), and with the regions above 30 minutes of commuting time from the border, both in
15:494:43227:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the BR and in the NBR. Table A1 in the Appendix shows summary statistics for municipalities
15:495:43318:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the border region in the distance bins at 0−10,10−20,20−30,and more than 30 minutes
15:496:43404:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:travel time from the Swiss border.  The last columns shows the characteristics of municipalities
15:497:43500:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the entire non-border region that we add to the control group in some specifications.  Looking
15:498:43597:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at education, age, and gender composition as of 1998, the last year before the policy changes,
15:499:43691:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:one does not identify any specific or systematic differences.  In our empirical analysis we control
15:500:43790:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for fixed effects at the municipality levels, region-trends, and sector-composition driven effects.
15:501:43889:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, there does not seem to be a systematic correlation of the considered economic variables
15:502:43985:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  the  distance  from  the  border,  which  provides  further  reassurance  to  the  validity  of  our
15:503:44091:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identifying assumption.  As we will detail below, we also test the pre-1999 trend in immigrants
15:504:44186:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  cross-border  workers  across  distance  bins  to  make  sure  that  those  were  not  significantly
15:505:44291:22:38:70:112:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:different.

15:507:44345:29:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our basic empirical specifications test whether, during theTransition(1999-2003) and/or during
15:508:44439:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theFull Liberalization(2004-2010) phases, labor market outcomes in municipalities close to the
15:509:44533:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:border (and hence treated), changed differentially from those in municipalities farther than 30
15:510:44628:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minutes from the border (and hence non treated), vis-`a-vis their relative behavior pre-1999.  To
15:511:44725:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this end, we define a dummyTransitiontwhich is equal to one in the years 2000, 2002 and 2004
15:512:44817:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and zero otherwise, and a dummyFreetwhich equals zero prior to 2004, and equals one in 2004,
15:513:44909:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2006, 2008 and 2010. Then we interact these two variables, which denote the two different phases
15:514:45005:22:22:70:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the reform in the Border Regions, with indicator dummies that differentiate municipalities
15:515:45098:22:22:70:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:according to their travel-time distance from the border so thatI(Di≤distm< Dj) is equal to
15:516:45188:22:22:70:524:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1 if municipalitymis betweenDiandDjminutes of commuting time from the border and 0
15:517:45270:22:22:70:524:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:otherwise.  This strategy produces a treatment-control type of framework as the distance of a

15:519:45456:22:0:70:524:71:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by the increase in potential access of CBW. Municipalities above 30 minutes of commuting time

16:530:46307:22:22:70:524:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:into  three  groups:   [0−10),  [10−20),and  [20−30)  so  that  we  can  estimate  a  potentially
16:531:46404:22:22:70:523:488:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:decreasing effect of the “treatment” on municipalities progressively farther from the border.21

17:582:50014:22:22:70:524:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2 above, some partial measures reducing the barriers to CBW mobility were enacted progressively

17:584:50203:22:21:70:524:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dynamics of the reform in a regression environment, using interactions between the distance

18:610:51685:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:impact of the policy should be zero prior to the date it was announced, and as we are assuming
18:611:51779:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the control municipalities represent a valid counter-factual for the treated ones, we should

19:641:54543:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance interval.  While they are prevalently positive, they are always smaller than 1.2 log points
19:642:54643:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and they do not show statistical significance in the first two distance bins (0−10 and 10−20
19:643:54735:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minutes from the border).  Second, in the Full Liberalization phase the coefficients are positive,
19:644:54833:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant and between three and four percentage points for the first two bins.  In the third bin
19:645:54931:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(20−30 km) the coefficient is around 1.3 to 1.6 percentage points in specifications (2) and (3),
19:646:55027:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:denoting a small increase in CBW relative to the pre-1999 phase.  This group can be seen as
19:647:55118:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“weakly” treated.  Finally, the inclusion or not of the NBR municipalities as controls, which is
19:648:55214:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:done in specification (3), does not make any difference (vis-`a-vis specification 2).  Considering
19:649:55312:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:municipalities in the BR over 30 minutes distance from the border as control is just as good as
19:650:55407:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using also those in the NBR. Overall full liberalization seems to have triggered an increase in
19:651:55502:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the supply of CBW by three to four percent of the employment, only in municipalities 0−20
19:652:55591:22:22:70:190:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minutes from the border.
19:653:55615:22:22:87:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In the estimates of columns (1)-(3) we assume that municipalities at 30 or more km from
19:654:55702:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  border  are  a  good  counter-factual  for  municipalities  near  the  border,  conditional  on  the
19:655:55807:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control variables.  In column (4) we adopt a different strategy to choose the counter-factual, and
19:656:55905:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we focus only on the municipalities closest to the border, which should be the most intensely
19:657:55998:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treated.   In  it  we  identify  the  coefficients  on  the  interaction  of  the  policy  variables  and  the
19:658:56108:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0−10 minute distance dummy using matched pairs of “treated” and “control” municipalities.
19:659:56197:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Specifically, we match each municipality in the 0−10 minute time range from the border with
19:660:56288:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:another municipality in one of two control groups, the area in the border region at 30 minutes
19:661:56382:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or more from the border or in the non-border region.  We pool the 3 waves from the pre-reform
19:662:56475:22:22:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:period (1994-1998) to gain precision and match municipalities based on the variance-weighted
19:663:56567:22:22:70:524:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference in the employment share of three education and four age groups, the share of foreign
19:664:56662:22:0:70:524:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers, the share of twelve broad industry groups, the mean log wage level, and the employment
20:665:56759:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level and density (number of workers per land area).  With this approach we are able to match
20:666:56852:22:22:70:523:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:327 municipalities in the 0−10 minute area of the border region to 243 control municipalities.
20:667:56946:22:22:87:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We then include only the group of matched municipalities in a regression similar to 2 with
20:668:57036:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only the interactions of the policy phases with the 0−10 dummies.  We additionally include as
20:669:57129:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:many matched-pair dummies as there are municipalities in the 0-10 interval.  In this case, the
20:670:57223:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient on the interaction betweenFREEtandTransitiontand the dummyI(distm<10)
20:671:57304:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  estimated  based  only  on  the  difference  between  the  treated  municipality  and  its  matched
20:672:57407:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control, allowing for any common unobservable factor in the two matched areas before and after
20:673:57501:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the border opening.  Column (4) shows the coefficients of this type of estimate.  This method
20:674:57594:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:produces  a  precisely  estimated  zero  value  (0.1  percentage  points)  for  the  Transitional  phase
20:675:57698:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  a  value  close  to  four  percentage  points  for  the  Full  Liberalization  phase.   The  change  in
20:676:57806:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW between the 0−10 minute municipalities and their matched control is even more clearly
20:677:57895:22:22:70:435:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:concentrated in the Full Liberalization period, and is sizable and significant.
20:678:57974:22:22:87:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:These results indicate that, considering two municipalities as similar as possible on several
20:679:58067:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dimensions prior to 1998, and allowing for any common unobserved trend over time, the munici-
20:680:58160:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:palities in the 0-10 minute time bin experienced a significant increase in CBW after 2004 relative
20:681:58258:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the ones at 30+ minutes.  These results also indicate that the effect arises most clearly in the
20:682:58357:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Full Liberalization phase, rather than during the Transition.  We will, however, describe the full
20:683:58455:22:22:70:384:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics of the effect when performing the year-by-year analysis.
20:684:58520:22:22:87:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Column (5)-(7) show the change in CBW, by education group, as percent of total employment
20:685:58609:22:22:70:523:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in 1998.  The estimates show that, especially for the 0−10 and 10−20 bins, highly- and middle-
20:686:58703:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated CBW were the groups whose supply increased more significantly, already starting in the
20:687:58798:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Transition and much more in the Full Liberalization phase.  Low-skilled CBW actually declined
20:688:58891:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:somewhat in the 0−10 minute region in both periods.  This implies that the net increase in CBW
20:689:58985:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was also a net increase in relative supply of highly skilled workers for the municipalities close
20:690:59082:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the border.24The municipality at 0−10 minutes from the border experienced a growth of
20:691:59170:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:middle and high educated CBW by 5 percent of total employment and a decline in less educated
20:692:59262:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW  by  1.5  percent  of  total  employment.   Not  only  did  more  workers  become  available  to
20:693:59362:22:22:70:523:160:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:municipalities in those areas, but they were significantly more highly educated than natives.25
20:694:59457:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Finally Column (8) of Table 2 shows the estimated coefficient if we consider the change of all
20:695:59551:22:16:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:foreign born, summing CBW and immigrants (I)in municipalitymand yeart, standardized by
20:696:59637:16:15:79:524:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:24Note that the coefficient of the three education groups (columns 5-7) sum up to the coefficient on total CBW
20:697:59747:15:7:70:127:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:in column (2).
20:698:59761:7:15:79:524:78:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:25In  Appendix  Table  A2  we  show  that  the  growth  in  CBW  was  especially  concentrated  among  highly  paid
20:699:59876:15:0:70:324:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Analysts, Consultants, R&D workers and medical occupations.
21:700:59937:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  same  denominator  (total  employment  in  1998),CBWm,t+Im,tEmpm,1998as  dependent  variable.   The
21:701:60041:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results  allow  us  to  check  whether  the  growth  in  total  foreign-born  in  municipalities  near  the
21:702:60148:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:border corresponds to the growth of CBW. A smaller response of total foreign-born may suggest
21:703:60241:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offsetting impacts (crowding-out) of CBW on immigrants.  We find a coefficient that is somewhat
21:704:60336:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:larger (but not statistically different) for the 0−10 and 10−20 group, relative to the one in
21:705:60429:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:column (2) estimated for CBW. This implies slight crowding in of other immigrants, but also
21:706:60520:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shows that most of the change in foreign-born in the municipalities near the border relative to
21:707:60615:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:those at 30 minutes plus (about 75% of it) was due, in the Full Liberalization period, to a larger
21:708:60713:22:38:70:144:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inflow of CBW.
21:709:60727:38:28:70:240:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.2    Year-by-Year Estimates
21:710:60756:28:22:70:524:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To  visualize  the  exact  dynamics  of  the  change  in  CBW  over  time,  we  present  the  estimates
21:711:60859:22:22:70:524:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  the  year-by-year  interactions  with  the  distance  dummies.   We  show  the  point  estimates  of
21:712:60963:22:22:70:524:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  coefficientsγd1,t,γd2,tandγd3,t(fort=  1994,  ...,  2010)  estimated  from  equation  (3)  in
21:713:61061:22:22:70:523:466:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f12:B:graphs.  Figure 3, Panel A-C shows as a solid line the estimated values for the coefficientsγd1,t
21:714:61158:22:22:70:524:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:capturing the changes in the 0−10 minute distance bin, and each panel represents a different
21:715:61250:22:22:70:524:422:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specification.   In  panel  A  the  dependent  variable  is  the  share  of  CBW  in  total  workers  of  a
21:716:61357:22:22:70:524:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regression specification as in equation (3).  We report also the coefficients for the 10−20 and
21:717:61452:22:22:70:524:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  20−30  bins  in  this  Panel.26Then  panel  D  shows  the  separate  coefficient  estimates  for
21:718:61553:22:22:70:524:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:high,  medium  and  low  skill  CBW  in  the  0−10  minutes  region.   As  we  have  biannual  data,
21:719:61653:22:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  report  the  estimates  for  the  even  years  1994-2010,  omitting  1998  (which  is  standardized
21:720:61756:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  zero).   We  show  the  95%  confidence  interval  as  a  vertical  line  around  the  diamonds  with
21:721:61861:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“ticks” as boundaries of the interval.  In Panel B we show the coefficients on the 0−10 minute
21:722:61955:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance  bin  only,  estimated  using  the  “matching”  method  described  above.   In  Panel  C  we
21:723:62056:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show the regression-based coefficients as in A, but using the total foreign born change (CBW
21:724:62148:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:+ immigrants), standardized by employment in 1998, as dependent variable.  Finally Panel D
21:725:62238:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shows  the  regression-based  coefficients  in  the  0−10  distance  bin,  when  we  separate  highly-,
21:726:62341:22:22:70:226:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:middle- and low-educated CBW.
21:727:62370:22:22:87:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Let us emphasize that the behavior of the 0−10 minute coefficients are similar in Panels A-C
21:728:62462:22:22:70:524:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and some features stand out.  First, in the pre-1999 years, none of the estimates for any of the
21:729:62558:22:16:70:524:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time bins is significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence level.  The estimates for the
21:730:62656:16:15:79:524:99:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:26In  these  specifications,  we  estimate  equation  (3)  only  for  municipalities  in  the  border  region,  including  as
21:731:62781:15:11:70:524:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:controls a full set of municipality and year fixed effects, NUTS II-specific trends and the Bartik index of employ-
21:732:62896:11:11:70:524:73:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:ment.  We performed other variations, e.g.  including municipalities in the non-border region in the control group,
21:733:63011:11:0:70:310:62:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:which give similar results.  See Online Appendix Figure A2.
22:734:63072:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0−10 bin show some fluctuations from 1994 to 1998 both for CBW (Panel A, B) and for total
22:735:63161:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:foreign born workers (Panel C) but none significantly different from zero.  The 10−20 minute
22:736:63253:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients are similar to those for the 0−10 interaction, showing a similar time behavior.  This
22:737:63351:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is consistent with the fact that before the reform of 1999 there was no differential growth in
22:738:63445:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the share of CBW in the municipalities near the border relative to others.  Second, the 20−30
22:739:63538:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients for the CBW supply are small throughout the period 1994-2010, implying smaller
22:740:63629:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes for CBW in this distance group even in the Full Liberalization Phase.  Thus, the trend
22:741:63723:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:forCBWin this bin is not very different from that of the control group (more than 30 minutes)
22:742:63816:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which received no CBW. When considering all foreign-born (in panel C) the 20−30 coefficients
22:743:63908:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show a stronger upward trend after 2004, denoting the possible larger inflow of immigrants in
22:744:64001:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this bin.  Third,  there is a weak upward trend in the 1999-2004 years (panel A and B), with
22:745:64093:22:22:70:523:533:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:an  estimated  increase  in  the  CBW  share  of  the  population  between  one  and  two  percent.27
22:746:64194:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Hence, the coefficients on the 0−10 minute bin shows some mild increase already during the
22:747:64284:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:transitional phase, but the individual coefficients do not rise to a statistically significant level.
22:748:64385:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:It is hard to say whether the anticipation or the initial measures started having an effect already
22:749:64484:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the 1999-2004 period, but we can say that any effect was minor.  The most important and
22:750:64574:22:22:70:523:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:clear fact is that after 2004 the coefficient on the 0−10 and on the 10−20 minutes bins grew
22:751:64666:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consistently (see Panel A and B and C) becoming significantly different from zero with positive
22:752:64761:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and significant point estimates in 2006, 2008 and 2010, when the full liberalization of CBW was
22:753:64856:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in place.  The point estimate for Panel A, in 2010 is about 0.08, implying that CBW workers
22:754:64947:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increased by 8 percentage points of initial employment between 1999 and 2010.  Most of this
22:755:65038:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:growth was after 2004.  The coefficient for the 10−20 minute bin in panel A (triangles connected
22:756:65134:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by the dashed line) shows a similar growth and an upward trend since 2004, reaching a value of
22:757:65228:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.06 in 2010.  The estimates for total new immigrants in Panel C, show similar patterns, except
22:758:65323:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the coefficients on the 20−30 minute bin show some positive and more significant effects,
22:759:65417:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:revealing inflows of resident immigrants to this region especially after liberalization of resident
22:760:65516:22:22:70:165:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:immigrants in 2007.
22:761:65535:22:22:87:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates reported in Panel D provide additional information and confirm two important
22:762:65625:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics of the CBW increase after 1999.  First, we see that the post-1999 growth of CBW
22:763:65720:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the 0−10 distance range (the only coefficient reported) is due to the increase of middle and
22:764:65815:22:16:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:highly educated CBW (dark and medium dashed lines).  Their pre-1999 trend was very flat and
22:765:65906:16:15:79:524:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:27When compared to 1998, the point estimates of 2002 and 2004 for the 0−10 bin seem to reveal a positive
22:766:66010:15:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:deviation.   However,  if  one  compares  them  with  an  average  pre-1999  (1994,  1996  and  1998)  there  is  really  no
22:767:66134:11:0:70:200:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:deviation (as shown in Table 2).
23:768:66168:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their  growth  took  off,  significantly,  only  after  2004.   Second,  the  growth  of  low-skilled  CBW
23:769:66274:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:remains close to zero (light dashed line) over the whole period, with possibly even a decrease
23:770:66368:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative to the pre-1999 period.  The noise of the data for low-skilled CBW, and the fact that
23:771:66462:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their coefficient remained rather flat for most of the period, suggests that this group remained at
23:772:66561:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pre-1999 level of mobility.  The Transitional phase and the Full Liberalization of CBW therefore
23:773:66657:22:22:70:514:664:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:implied a clear increase in supply in medium- and skilled CBW but not in less-skilled ones.28
23:774:66750:22:22:87:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:An additional feature of the CBW changes reported in Figure 3 is worth emphasizing.  The
23:775:66838:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:supply of CBW in municipalities 0−10 minutes from the border increased progressively starting
23:776:66931:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in 2004.  Clearly there was no immediate “jump”produced by free CBW movement, but rather
23:777:67019:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a progressive growth in their share of employment from 2004 to 2010.  Likely, the opening of the
23:778:67115:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:border made firms recognize opportunities to hire new highly skilled CBW and it encouraged
23:779:67205:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them to create more jobs, slowly affecting their employment.  This emphasizes the importance
23:780:67297:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of analyzing the “total” rather than “partial” effects of immigration over time, which accounts
23:781:67392:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for several margins of adjustment.  The dynamics of capital investment,  the transition of na-
23:782:67486:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tives  across  occupations,  firms’  growth  and  birth  of  new  firms  occurredat  the  same  timeas
23:783:67588:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the CBW inflow took place, and in anticipation and response to that inflow.  Hence the com-
23:784:67679:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parison of outcomes with the changes in CBW across years produces a picture of simultaneous
23:785:67770:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adjustments  in  response  to  a  cumulated  increase  of  immigrants.   What  is  new  in  this  paper
23:786:67873:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  that  we  can  analyze  first  the  effect  of  the  immigration  policy  on  immigration  flows  before
23:787:67981:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:analyzing the consequences of immigrants on natives.  Our study, and the work of Ruffner and
23:788:68073:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Siegenthaler  (2016),  are  among  the  very  few  (as  far  as  we  know)  that  track  the  effects  of  a
23:789:68181:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:permanent immigration policy change in a developed country.  Our focus is on the analysis of its
23:790:68277:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consequences both on immigrants and on labor market outcomes and on the internal migration
23:791:68367:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and inter-sectoral and inter-job dynamic adjustment of native workers.  The work of Ruffner and
23:792:68462:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Siegenthaler (2016), complementary to this, analyzes the impact on firm creation, innovation,
23:793:68555:22:16:70:189:226:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:R&D and productivity.29
23:794:68578:16:15:79:524:210:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:28In Appendix Table A2, we report the change in the number of CBW (relative to total employment in 1998)
23:795:68682:15:11:70:524:195:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:for 24 separate occupation categories in the SESS data.  This shows that the largest contribution to the overall
23:796:68794:11:11:70:524:184:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:increase in CBW came from middle and highly-paying occupations, particularly from occupations entrusted with
23:797:68902:11:7:70:444:173:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:reviewing/consulting/certifying, R&D, analyze/program/operating and medical occupations.

24:803:69346:29:22:70:524:711:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  findings  in  the  previous  section  establish  that  by  2010  the  policy  of  free  labor  market
24:804:69452:22:21:70:524:689:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:access for CBW increased their supply by about four to five percentage points of employment in
24:805:69546:21:22:70:524:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:municipalities within a 0−10 minute commute from the border.  It also increased their supply
24:806:69638:22:22:70:524:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by a similar amount in municipalities 10−20 minutes from the border.  Beyond that commuting
24:807:69729:22:22:70:524:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time, the effects on CBW supply are one percent or smaller.  Tertiary and secondary-educated
24:808:69821:22:22:70:524:602:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW were the groups responsible for the whole increase.  Did this result in depressed wages
24:809:69912:22:22:70:524:580:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or employment for highly-skilled natives?  Were the wages of other groups of workers affected
24:810:70005:22:22:70:524:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:through complementarity?  Or did firms respond by creating jobs for highly-educated and absorb
24:811:70099:22:22:70:524:536:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the larger supply of CBW? And did native workers respond by moving from close to the border
24:812:70190:22:22:70:452:514:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to other areas?  Or by changing jobs?  And which industries were more affected?
24:813:70269:22:22:87:524:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To answer these questions, we first analyze the effect of the policy changes on wages, em-
24:814:70359:22:22:70:524:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ployment, and hours worked by Swiss natives in aggregate.  We estimate a regression in the form
24:815:70454:22:22:70:524:448:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of equation (2) with municipalities as units and the average logarithm of native hourly wages as
24:816:70550:22:22:70:524:426:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dependent variable.30We show the main estimated coefficients interacting the policy phase
24:817:70643:22:21:70:524:404:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the distance bins in Column (1) and (2) of Table 3a.  If one thinks of the change in supply
24:818:70738:21:22:70:524:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of CBW as the dependent variable and of the policy dummies interacted with distance bins as
24:819:70829:22:22:70:524:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the instrument, then the coefficient reported are those from a reduced-form IV regression.  The
24:820:70924:22:22:70:524:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient estimates represent the intention-to-treat effect (ITT) and the treated groups are the
24:821:71022:22:22:70:524:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0−10 and 10−20 minute bins.  The point estimates of the impact on native wages can then
24:822:71109:22:22:70:524:295:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be used to derive the elasticity of their response to the change in the supply of CBW, estimated
24:823:71205:22:22:70:524:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Table 2, dividing the first coefficient by the second.  Column (1) shows estimates from the
24:824:71299:22:22:70:524:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specifications with all controls and including only municipalities in the Border Region.  Column

24:826:71484:22:16:70:524:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the coefficients estimated separately by education group.  Column (1) in Panel A in Table 3b
24:827:71576:16:15:79:524:191:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:30Table A3 in the Appendix shows the estimates using log of monthly wages as dependent variable.  Monthly
24:828:71681:15:7:70:505:176:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:wages are originally collected in the SESS. The results are similar to those obtained using log hourly wages.
24:829:71790:7:30:79:482:169:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:31When we consider wage as outcome we use a Bartik measure also based on national wage growth:

25:846:72424:22:22:70:523:752:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:and Panel C does the same for middle educated and low educated native workers, respectively.32
25:847:72518:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The point estimates of Table 3b show the “total” effect of immigrants on the wage of each ed-
25:848:72611:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ucation group of natives.  Those of table 3a show the total effect on average native wages.  The
25:849:72707:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients captures the impact on native wages both from competition of CBW with similar
25:850:72797:22:22:70:386:664:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:skills and from complementarity from CBW with different skills.33
25:851:72862:22:22:87:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Inspecting the estimates of Table 3a, the first consideration is that the effects on the average
25:852:72958:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages  in  the  0−10  and  10−20  minute  bins  are  very  small  and  never  significant  both  in
25:853:73057:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  “Transition”  and  in  the  “Full  Liberalization”  phase.   The  point  estimates  for  the  0−10
25:854:73160:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  10−20  bins  are  usually  positive  but  small  (never  larger  than  1.8  log  points)  and  never
25:855:73265:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant at the 5% confidence level.  Since we found that the post-2004 liberalization increased
25:856:73364:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the share of CBW by about four to five percent of the employment in bins at 0−20 minute
25:857:73451:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distance,  the implied elasticity for the average wage effect is compatible with values between
25:858:73546:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:-0.3 and 0.3, using the estimates of the 0−10 and 10−20 interacted with Full-liberalization.
25:859:73638:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Given  the  standard  errors,  a  zero  effect  cannot  be  rejected  at  any  level  of  confidence.   An
25:860:73744:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explanation based on a classical model of “change in supply for fixed demand” does not work
25:861:73835:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:well  in  this  case  (as  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  short  run  of  a  negative  effect).   This  is  even
25:862:73950:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:clearer  when  we  look  at  the  impact  by  education  group  shown  in  Table  3b.   As  documented
25:863:74052:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:above,  Full  Liberalization  produced  a  larger  inflow  of  highly  educated  CBW  relative  to  less-
25:864:74157:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated ones.  Hence the canonical “partial effects” model would imply a negative wage effect
25:865:74251:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on highly-educated natives and positive effects on low-educated ones.  To the contrary, the most
25:866:74347:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant effects, which are robust across specifications, are reported in column (1) of Panel A
25:867:74445:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of table 3b and show apositivepositive coefficient on the wages of the highly-educated in the
25:868:74538:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Full Liberalization phase, in the order of + 4% in the 0−10 and the 10−20 minute bins.  The
25:869:74629:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient is positive but not significant (equal to 1.6%) for the 20−30 minute bin.  Smaller
25:870:74723:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive  effects,  especially  in  the  0−10  minute  bins  appear  already  in  the  Transition  phase.
25:871:74828:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:At the same time, no wage effects are significant at the 5%-level for the middle educated and
25:872:74921:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the low educated (Panel B and C, Column (1)).  Some point estimates are estimated to be
25:873:75012:22:16:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:negative in any of the phases.  The changes in wages of highly-educated natives are consistent
25:874:75106:16:15:79:524:144:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:32The random sampling of the SESS implies that some municipalities have missing information for the dependent
25:875:75215:15:11:70:524:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:variable of some education groups.  This explains the difference in the number of observations across education
25:876:75326:11:11:70:524:118:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:groups (panels) of a particular specification in the Table 3b and also in Table 3a.  We found similar results when
25:877:75440:11:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:dropping municipalities below the 20th percentile of aggregate employment each year or dropping municipalities
25:878:75550:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:that had missing information in aggregate employment in any year.  These results are shown for log hourly wages
25:879:75661:11:7:70:426:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and total hours as dependent variables in the Appendix Tables A4 and A5, respectively.
25:880:75747:7:15:79:524:78:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:33See Ottaviano and Peri (2012) for a more formal argument about the estimation of a total effect of immigrants
25:881:75858:15:0:70:482:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:aggregating all the direct competition and indirect complementarity effects from different skill groups.
26:882:75964:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  a  causal  effect  of  the  increase  in  CBW,  but  not  with  a  simple  neoclassical  model.   The
26:883:76071:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:channels of this complementarity/productivity effect can be several.  We suggest three of them
26:884:76165:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:here that have been recently proposed in relation to immigrants.  First, a larger supply of CBW
26:885:76260:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pushes firms to expand and create new jobs (as in a search model `a la Chassamboulli and Palivos
26:886:76356:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2014)) with some of those jobs filled by natives.  Second, firms’ return to investing in equipment
26:887:76455:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:capital  and  new  technologies  that  complement  the  skills  of  CBW  increases,  and  investment
26:888:76555:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enhances productivity of native workers too (as in Lewis, 2011, Lafortune, Tessada and Lewis
26:889:76647:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2015) or Peri (2012)).  Finally, local human capital externalities of the type analyzed in Moretti
26:890:76746:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2004a,b; 2010), and occupational upgrading of native highly skilled jobs as described in Peri and
26:891:76844:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Sparber (2009), could increase productivity through learning, higher efficiency and technological
26:892:76941:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:adoption.  Such models can generate increases in productivity for groups whose supply increases.
26:893:77037:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Increased productivity and job creation for high skilled natives are also consistent with the firm-
26:894:77136:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level evidence presented by Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) and reviewed in Section 6.5 below.
26:895:77230:22:22:87:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates for the full dynamic year-by-year interactions with distance bins are shown in
26:896:77322:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 4 Panels A-D. The panels show the year-bin coefficient estimates for the 0−10 minute bin
26:897:77417:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only and the 95% confidence interval obtained from specification (3) with the average logarithm
26:898:77512:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of native wages as the dependent variable in Panel A, the log wage of highly-educated natives
26:899:77605:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Panel B, and the same wage measure for middle- and low-educated natives in Panels C and
26:900:77695:22:22:70:488:379:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:D, respectively.  The estimated coefficients for the [10−20) minute region are similar.34
26:901:77784:22:22:87:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:There is some variability in the estimates before 1999, but there is no evidence of a systematic
26:902:77880:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pre-trend.  None of Panels A-D, show evidence that the intensely treated municipalities (0−10
26:903:77973:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bin) had a systematically different wage trends relative to the control group before 1999.  This
26:904:78069:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is consistent with our identifying assumptions.  For the aggregate log wages we observe a small
26:905:78164:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and non-significant drop in 2004 (the point estimate is half the size of the standard error) and
26:906:78260:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:no change after then.  This amounts to no evidence of an average wage effect.  Panel B, relative
26:907:78356:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to highly skilled wages, shows instead positive and significant coefficients after 2004, reaching
26:908:78453:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about  four  to  five  percent  by  2010.   The  timing  and  scale  of  the  effect  is  consistent  with  a
26:909:78562:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive effect of CBW on productivity of high skilled Swiss workers with a semi-elasticity of
26:910:78656:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about one (namely an increase of CBW of one percent of employment produces a one percent
26:911:78744:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage increase).  The other two groups of native workers (middle- and less-educated) have smaller
26:912:78840:22:16:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and non significant wage changes, with the low-educated experiencing a drop between 2000 and
26:913:78932:16:15:79:524:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:34In  the  reported  figures  we  estimated  the  equation  (3)  only  for  municipalities  in  the  border  region  and  we
26:914:79056:15:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:always include a full set of municipality and year fixed effects,  region-specific trends and an education-specific

27:916:79196:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2004 and a more mixed path between 2004 and 2010, while the middle educated have a small
27:917:79284:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:drop in 2004 as well.  Yet this change is also not significant statistically.35Combining evidence
27:918:79381:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from Tables 3a, 3b and Figure 4, we find consistent evidence of a significant wage increase for
27:919:79476:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:highly-educated natives in the areas where and periods when CBW increased as a consequence
27:920:79566:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  the  new  policies.   Both  middle-skill  native  workers  and  native  workers  as  a  whole  did  not
27:921:79673:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experience  any  significant  effect.   Less-skilled  workers  possibly  experienced  a  small,  negative,
27:922:79779:22:38:70:191:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:still not significant effect.

27:924:79862:29:22:70:524:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A second important aspect of the potential labor market effects of CBW is the impact on native
27:925:79956:22:21:70:524:553:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor supply.  While positively affecting productivity of high skilled natives, did CBW displaced
27:926:80053:21:22:70:524:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor supply of native workers?  We measure this variable as the logarithm of total number of
27:927:80146:22:22:70:524:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:native workers or,  alternatively,  as the logarithm of total hours worked by natives.  The first
27:928:80243:22:22:70:524:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measure  captures  only  the  extensive  margin  of  labor  supply,  while  the  second  combines  the
27:929:80345:22:22:70:524:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extensive and intensive margin.  Table 3a, columns (3) and (4) shows the coefficients of interest
27:930:80442:22:22:70:524:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for total native employment and columns (5) and (6) for total native work hours, respectively.

27:936:81006:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worked are somewhat noisy and the standard errors can be as large as 6 percent and sometimes
27:937:81098:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they exceed 15 percent for the small group of less-educated.  They, however, never show evidence
27:938:81194:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of an “crowding out” effect on native employment or native hours worked (which would imply
27:939:81284:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:negative and significant coefficients).  The point estimates for the aggregate employment and
27:940:81377:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hours effects during the Full Liberalization period are not significant and are usually positive (see
27:941:81478:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also Figure 5, Panel A). For individual education groups, we see some positive and significant
27:942:81572:22:22:70:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients on the highly-educated employment and working hours mainly in the 20−30 bin,
27:943:81661:22:16:70:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which was only weakly treated.  This may imply some spillover effects from the bins closer to
27:944:81754:16:15:79:524:143:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:35We find qualitatively similar results when we use two alternative definitions of workers’ skills and when we
27:945:81864:15:11:70:524:128:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:use two distance bins (0−15 and 15−30 minutes) only.  Figure A3 shows the year effects for 15-minute distance
27:946:81973:11:11:70:524:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:partitions (Panel I) and for wage tercile and occupation based partitions (Panel II and III). In all cases, the effect
27:947:82091:11:11:70:524:106:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:on highly skilled wage is positive and usually significant for the region closest to the border in the post-2004 years.
27:948:82210:11:7:70:431:95:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:For the other two education groups, the effects are usually close to zero and insignificant.
27:949:82302:7:15:79:524:88:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:36The regressions used to obtain the coefficients of Figure 5 includes year and municipality fixed effects, region-

28:952:82619:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:there seems to be a positive but not significant (noisy) effect near the border for employment
28:953:82713:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and hours worked.  The increase in employment and hours worked by less-educated natives can
28:954:82804:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggest an increase in the demand for their services resulting from the complementarity with
28:955:82896:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  services  of  skilled  CBW.  This  demand  could  have  triggered  a  rather  elastic  labor  supply
28:956:83001:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:response of less-skilled workers without affecting their wages much.  The estimates, however, are
28:957:83098:22:22:70:482:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not significant at standard confidence levels and so we should take them with caution.
28:958:83184:22:22:87:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Altogether, the estimated wage and employment coefficients are consistent with a positive
28:959:83273:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:complementary/productivity effect of CBW on high skilled native workers. Moreover they do not
28:960:83366:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggest crowding out, or pure competition from CBW. In particular, the positive and significant
28:961:83461:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect on the wages of highly-educated and the null to positive overall effects on their employment
28:962:83560:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are at odds with pure competition effects that would prevail in a canonical neoclassical model.
28:963:83655:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In order to understand better the channels of response of native workers and firms that allow
28:964:83748:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such a positive impact on native workers, we analyze in greater detail some specific transitions
28:965:83844:22:38:70:431:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of native workers into and out of employment, and between jobs or regions.

28:967:83942:29:22:70:524:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:To further alleviate the concern that unobserved variables may create a bias in the estimates
28:968:84035:22:22:70:524:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the effect of CBW in the wage and employment regressions, we perform several robustness
28:969:84125:22:22:70:524:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:checks, reported in Appendix Tables A6a for aggregate variables and A6b, panel A-C, for skill-
28:970:84219:22:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific groups.  As a first check, shown in that Table in columns (1) and (5), we estimate our
28:971:84314:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:baseline specification (2), using less conservative standard errors, clustered at the municipality
28:972:84412:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level instead of the commuting zone level.  Compared to the baseline estimates above (in columns
28:973:84508:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(1) and (5) of Tables 3a and 3b), however, this check leads to almost no change in the significance
28:974:84607:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level of the coefficients.  Second, while we found no evidence for a pre-1999 trend and our baseline
28:975:84707:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specification already includes separate trends for the seven NUTS II regions, columns (2) and (6)
28:976:84804:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allow for a separate trend for each of the 26 Cantons in Switzerland.  Adding the canton-specific
28:977:84901:22:22:70:523:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:trends we observe a small decrease in the positive 0−10 and 10−20 wage coefficient on high
28:978:84991:22:22:70:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:skilled during the Full Liberalization period and a small increases in the 10−20 and 20−30
28:979:85081:22:22:70:524:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment and hours coefficient.  However, the differences are minor.  A third robustness check
28:980:85177:22:22:70:524:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has to do with the concern that the economies of large cities near the border, such as Geneva,
28:981:85271:22:22:70:524:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Basel and Lugano, may drive the whole ”attraction effect” for CBW after Full Liberalization.
28:982:85363:22:0:70:524:71:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Hence, we estimate a specification excluding border cities in Columns (3) and (7) of Appendix
29:983:85458:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Table A6a and A6b.  This change does not have any significant impact on the results.  Finally,

29:986:85739:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 0−10 minute region,  and we match them with most similar ones in the +30min region.
29:987:85826:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The  estimated  coefficients  are  significantly  positive  for  the  high  skilled  wage  effect  after  full
29:988:85936:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:liberalization, confirming that the positive productivity effect of CBW on that group seems the
29:989:86031:22:45:70:329:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strongest result of our wage and employment analysis.

29:992:86185:29:22:70:524:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As municipalities are small open economies, part of the effect of a larger supply of CBW may
29:993:86277:22:21:70:524:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spill  over  to  other  municipalities  in  different  ways.   Of  particular  interest  is  how  inflows  of
29:994:86386:21:22:70:524:491:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW may affect the ways Swiss workers move to other municipalities nearby or in the rest of
29:995:86477:22:22:70:524:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Switzerland, and how they may affect the inflow from other Swiss municipalities.  A significant
29:996:86572:22:22:70:524:447:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:movement of Swiss workers to other municipalities, possibly within the border region but farther
29:997:86668:22:22:70:524:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from  the  border,  may  affect  the  municipalities  farther  than  30  minutes  from  the  border  and
29:998:86772:22:22:70:524:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hence question our assumption that they are a valid control group.  Past research (e.g.  Card
29:999:86865:22:22:70:523:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and DiNardo, 2000; Peri and Sparber, 2011a) has not found significant outflows of natives in
29:1000:86957:22:22:70:524:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:response to immigration.  However, recent papers (e.g.  Dustmann, Sch ̈onberg and Stuhler, 2017)
29:1001:87053:22:22:70:524:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have suggested that inflows of natives from other areas may be reduced following immigration,
29:1002:87146:22:22:70:490:315:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:producing a “crowding out” of potential natives who would have moved into the region.
29:1003:87231:22:22:87:524:293:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In table 4 we show the key findings about the changes in net flows (column (1)) and inflows
29:1004:87322:22:22:70:524:271:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(columns 2 and 3) and outflows (columns 4 and 5) from/to other Swiss municipalities in the Full
29:1005:87417:22:22:70:524:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Liberalization period.  Additionally we divide these flows between municipalities within the 30
29:1006:87512:22:21:70:524:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:minute range from the border (columns 2 and 4) and those farther than 30 minutes (columns 3
29:1007:87603:21:22:70:524:206:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and 5).  For compactness, we only report the coefficients in the Full liberalization period, first
29:1008:87701:22:22:70:524:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:considering all workers (panel A) and then the three education groups separately (Panels B-D).
29:1009:87795:22:22:70:524:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Results in the Transitional period are weaker and reported in Appendix Table A7.  In Table 4
29:1010:87887:22:22:70:524:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dependent variable for each column is a different flow into or out of a municipality during
29:1011:87982:22:22:70:524:118:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a year, standardized by the initial employment of the municipalitym.  Hence the dependent
29:1012:88071:22:22:70:331:96:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable is a migration/rate as percent of employment.
29:1013:88125:22:0:87:524:74:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To construct these variables, we use the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS) as a complemen-
30:1014:88215:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tary data set.  Most individuals in the SLFS were interviewed for two consecutive years,  and
30:1015:88308:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we can calculate the flow variables at the municipal level using the employment status and the
30:1016:88402:22:22:70:454:730:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:place of work for each individual in the previous or the next year, respectively.37
30:1017:88485:22:22:87:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Panel  A  of  Table  4  shows  that  the  coefficients  on  net  flows  (column  1),  inflows  (columns
30:1018:88588:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2) and (3)) and outflows (columns (4) and (5)) for all Swiss workers are very small and never
30:1019:88682:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant.  This implies that there is no sign of spillovers effect or indirect impact on potential
30:1020:88783:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:movers during Full Liberalization.  When looking at the highly educated, which is the only group
30:1021:88879:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for which we find a robust wage effect, in panel B of Table 4, we see no significant coefficient
30:1022:88975:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the net migration nor for gross inflows or outflows from/to the area within 30 minutes from
30:1023:89070:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the border (columns (2) and (4)).  There is one coefficient which is significant for the inflow and
30:1024:89169:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outflow of workers from/to regions at more than 30 minutes from the border.  These are for the
30:1025:89263:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10−20 minute bin, and they have the same sign and similar magnitude, implying smaller inflows
30:1026:89356:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and smaller outflows of similar amounts and so, in net, no effect.  Hence there is no significant
30:1027:89453:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence that net flows of highly educated Swiss workers between treated municipalities and any
30:1028:89548:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the considered distance bins has played a significant role in the adjustment.  In panel C we
30:1029:89643:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:see no evidence of net flows for middle educated while for less educated there is one positive
30:1030:89737:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficient  on  net  with  the  municipalities  at  10−20  minutes  from  the  border.   This  may  be
30:1031:89840:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:somewhat consistent with the positive (albeit only not marginally significant) employment effect
30:1032:89936:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:showed in Table 3b on employment.  The lack of a clear distance pattern and the imprecision of
30:1033:90030:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:some of the estimates in panel D, however, do not support too strongly the idea of a significant
30:1034:90126:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:internal  migration  response  of  less-educated  workers.   All  estimated  changes  in  net  flows  are
30:1035:90231:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small and are unlikely to have any impact on the average control municipalities (in the regions
30:1036:90326:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at more than 30 minutes from the border).  Overall, the inflow of CBW who were mainly highly-
30:1037:90419:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated  increased  their  supply  in  municipalities  very  close  to  the  border  without  creating  a
30:1038:90525:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:”domino” or ”spillover” effect of native internal migration towards other part of the country.
30:1039:90619:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We also note here that the flows of Swiss workers from the border region to outside Switzerland
30:1040:90714:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(as commuters or migrants in the reverse direction from the one considered in the paper) were
30:1041:90807:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:negligible,  as  the  wage  differential  between  Switzerland  and  municipalities  in  other  countries
30:1042:90912:22:17:70:255:160:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:near the border is large (up to 30%).38
30:1043:90951:17:14:79:524:143:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:37Due to a structural break in this data from year 2010 onward, we only use the years 1996 to 2009 (on a yearly
30:1044:91062:14:11:70:524:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:basis) when computing flow variables between two consecutive years (e.g.  in Table 4 or Appendix Table A7).  In

30:1046:91286:11:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:year 2010.  We only use the SLFS to analyze additional mechanisms and worker transitions as the data set is much
30:1047:91398:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:smaller than the SESS, which we use for our main analysis.  Nevertheless, we replicated all our main results using
30:1048:91512:11:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the SLFS and all results were qualitatively similar.  See Appendix B for more details on the exact calculation of
30:1049:91625:11:7:70:143:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the flow variables.
30:1050:91644:7:0:79:524:67:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:38In fact,  aggregate statistics collected by the Federal Statistical Office suggest that the absolute number of

31:1052:91796:29:22:70:524:745:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Internal geographical mobility was not significantly affected by the increase of CBW. What, then,
31:1053:91893:22:22:70:524:723:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were  the  mechanisms  put  in  motion to  absorb  the  new  workers  and  to  produce  the  observed
31:1054:91994:22:22:70:524:701:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage/productivity effects on high skilled Swiss workers?  We explore here several alternatives,
31:1055:92089:22:22:70:524:679:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:beginning with the different specialization between CBW and native Swiss workers and the oc-
31:1056:92181:22:22:70:524:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cupational response of natives.  As shown above, highly educated CBW were primarily employed
31:1057:92273:22:22:70:524:635:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Technical/Scientific and Engineering type of jobs.  One possibility is that, in companies hiring
31:1058:92372:22:22:70:524:613:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CBW, we may observe an incentive for highly educated Swiss workers to move towards the high
31:1059:92463:22:22:70:524:591:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:end of managerial jobs (see a similar phenomenon in Peri and Sparber (2011b) and Peri, Shih
31:1060:92554:22:22:70:524:569:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Sparber (2015b)).  Positions in the top organizational tiers of management require knowl-
31:1061:92647:22:21:70:524:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:edge of local culture, laws and norms, and possibly a local network of contacts.  Those are more
31:1062:92743:21:22:70:524:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accessible to a native than to a foreign individual.39The demand for top managerial jobs grew
31:1063:92836:22:22:70:524:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as firms became larger and more productive, as hiring CBW as STEM workers was a way to
31:1064:92922:22:22:70:524:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:grow.  Hence we analyze whether natives, especially highly-educated ones, were more likely to
31:1065:93015:22:22:70:524:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:become high-level managers in the executive board of Swiss companies after the introduction
31:1066:93106:22:22:70:524:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of free mobility of CBW. To do this,  we use a question in the SLFS that identifies if worker
31:1067:93199:22:22:70:524:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is in the top executive level (“Direktion/Gesch ̈aftsleitung”) of a firm, which we consider as top
31:1068:93297:22:22:70:188:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:management of the firm.
31:1069:93320:22:22:87:524:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table 5 uses as the dependent variable in columns (1) and (2) the share of native workers in
31:1070:93412:22:22:70:524:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:executive boards (i.e.  in the top tier of management) relative to native employment.  Column

31:1072:93597:22:22:70:524:306:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:top managerial positions.  For compactness we show the coefficients on the interaction between

31:1074:93784:22:21:70:524:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and (10−20] which were more intensely treated.  We partition the results in panels reporting
31:1075:93876:21:22:70:524:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  estimates  for  all  workers  at  the  top  (Panel  A),  and  then  proceeding  down  the  Table,  for
31:1076:93983:22:22:70:524:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:highly-educated workers (Panel B), middle-educated workers (Panel C), and for less-educated
31:1077:94074:22:22:70:524:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers (Panel D), respectively. We find that for highly-educated and middle-educated there was
31:1078:94169:22:22:70:524:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a significant increase in the share of natives in the top tier of management in the 0−10 or in the
31:1079:94267:22:22:70:524:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10−20 minute bins. Employment and hours worked in those jobs (column 3 and 4) also increased
31:1080:94359:22:20:70:524:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significantly for highly educated.40The effect on middle-educated is not significant for workers
31:1081:94455:20:11:70:524:111:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Swiss cross-border workers commuting for work abroad increased a bit since 2002 but still constitutes a negligible
31:1082:94569:11:7:70:336:100:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:share of total employment (Swiss Federal Statistical Office, 2015).
31:1083:94636:7:15:79:524:93:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:39Appendix Table A10 shows that CBW usually work in language region where they speak the local language.
31:1084:94740:15:11:70:524:78:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Thus language may not “per se” be a significant source of comparative advantage.  Institutional and local knowl-
31:1085:94852:11:7:70:430:67:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:edge, though, can be just as important in creating specialization and relative advantages.
31:1086:94942:7:0:79:524:60:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:40The latter two effects imply that the change in share of managers must be driven by the entry of individuals
32:1087:95054:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and hours (column 3 and 4). We infer that for this intermediate group the response is not as clear
32:1088:95152:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as for the highly-educated. For less-educated the impact is negative or null, but on average a very
32:1089:95251:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small share of these workers is in management positions so that in aggregate the effect on this
32:1090:95346:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:group is very small.  These estimates are consistent with the idea that, due to complementarity
32:1091:95441:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  CBW  and  productivity  growth  in  the  firms,  native  workers  were  more  likely  to  become
32:1092:95543:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:top-tier managers in firms that hired CBW as technical and scientific professionals.  By moving
32:1093:95638:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to those jobs,  natives’ wages increased,  and this accounts for a portion of the increase in the
32:1094:95735:22:22:70:254:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage found for this group in Table 3b.
32:1095:95773:22:22:87:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In Table 6,  we show more precisely what part of the highly educated wage effects can be
32:1096:95861:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:attributed  to  higher  top  management  wages  and  to  a  larger  share  of  natives  moving  to  top
32:1097:95964:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:management  positions.   In  the  first  column  we  reproduce  the  estimated  effects  on  the  “Full
32:1098:96067:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Liberalization”  dummy  interacted  with  distance  bins  on  the  wage  of  highly  educated  native
32:1099:96168:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers.   Then  we  show  the  impact  on  wages  in  top  management  (column  2)  and  in  non-
32:1100:96266:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:management  (column  3)  positions.   We  see  that  the  positive  effect  is  30%  stronger  on  top
32:1101:96368:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:management position, which likely benefit more of the improved hiring and expansion of firms’
32:1102:96461:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:productivity and scale because of CBW. This already suggests a stronger complementarity of
32:1103:96551:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:top management with CBW. Column (4) show the wage increase in highly educated if the share
32:1104:96641:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of natives in top-management positions is kept constant at the pre-1999 level.  This specification
32:1105:96739:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controls for the reallocation of natives towards top management.  We see that the effect is 20%
32:1106:96834:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(in the 0−10 bin) to 45% (in the 10−20 bin) smaller than in column (1).  This implies that
32:1107:96924:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a non negligible share of the wage growth of natives is simply due to the reallocation of highly
32:1108:97020:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated  natives  towards  high  management  positions.   An  important  margin  of  adjustment
32:1109:97116:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  highly-educated  Swiss  workers  was  to  transition  towards  managerial  positions  as  highly-
32:1110:97218:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated CBW took technical, math-intensive, and engineering type of jobs.  This upgrading to
32:1111:97311:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:high management is a form of occupational upgrading among natives that seems often triggered
32:1112:97403:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by immigration.  For instance, Cattaneo, Fiorio and Peri (2015) for countries in the European
32:1113:97496:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Union and in Foged and Peri (2016) for Denmark have shown that native workers upgrade their
32:1114:97587:22:22:70:471:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:occupations in response to immigration by moving into more complex types of jobs.
32:1115:97668:22:22:87:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A further piece of evidence confirming that the wage gains for highly educated are in part
32:1116:97758:22:22:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:driven by upgrading to managerial positions is provided in Appendix table A9.  We show the
32:1117:97848:22:20:70:524:116:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients on the wage and hours worked by highly educated across demographic groups, sep-
32:1118:97940:20:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:into management positions rather than the exit of non-managers in highly exposed areas,  as employment and
32:1119:98046:11:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:hors worked by this group increase.  In unreported results, we found no effect on the employment and hours of
32:1120:98155:11:0:70:128:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:non-managers.

33:1122:98272:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with  high  (more  than  6  years)  and  low  tenure  at  the  current  job.   The  strongest  results  are
33:1123:98379:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  changes  in  hours  worked  by  different  sub-groups  among  highly  educated.   Supporting  the
33:1124:98481:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesis that CBW stimulated demand for natives in top managerial positions, males, older
33:1125:98572:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers, and those with longer tenure are the groups experiencing a larger and more significant
33:1126:98667:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase  in  hours  worked.   These  are  the  groups  more  likely  to  be  in  managerial  positions  in
33:1127:98774:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Swiss economy.  Higher demand for highly-educated males and highly-experienced natives
33:1128:98864:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  consistent  with  the  upgrading  story  at  the  top  of  the  managerial  ladder.   It  is  likely  that
33:1129:98974:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:complementarity between CBW, who specialize in technical and scientific skills, and top man-

33:1131:99157:21:38:70:435:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers.  This is the strongest and most consistent effect found in the paper.

33:1133:99277:29:22:70:524:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:An  important  dimension  of  the  heterogeneity  of  the  CBW  effect  is  their  different  presence
33:1134:99379:22:22:70:524:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across sectors.  As they were heavily employed as IT professionals, engineers, and scientists, this
33:1135:99478:22:22:70:524:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implies a larger direct impact on productivity growth in the sectors that use these skills more
33:1136:99573:22:22:70:524:422:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensively.  Those are the high-tech manufacturing sectors and the more knowledge-intensive

33:1140:99948:22:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may  have  affected  wages  differentially  across  sectors  and  more  in  those  experiencing  larger

34:1163:102088:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between ”FREE” and the [0−10) and [10−20) distance bin,  which are the most intensely
34:1164:102173:22:22:70:130:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:treated bins.
34:1165:102186:22:22:87:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The post-liberalization period was characterized by a much larger inflow of CBW in high-tech
34:1166:102278:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:manufacturing (+5.8 and +4.4 percent in the two distance bins) and knowledge intensive services
34:1167:102373:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(+5.1 and +3.9 percent) than in other sectors.  These heterogeneous inflows are consistent with
34:1168:102468:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the idea that CBW were mainly employed in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive
34:1169:102557:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:service sectors.  Hence, those sectors are also where we expect the strongest complementarity
34:1170:102650:22:22:70:196:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effect with native workers.

34:1172:102774:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups,  the  only  significant  coefficient  at  the  1%  level  is  the  one  on  wages  in  the  high-tech
34:1173:102883:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:manufacturing for workers in the 0−10 minute bin.  Also positive, non-negligible in magnitude
34:1174:102976:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:but not statistically significant is the coefficient on knowledge-intensive sectors (close to 10%
34:1175:103073:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significance for the 10−20 bin).  The coefficients on low-tech manufacturing and on knowledge-
34:1176:103167:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-intensive services are negative and almost significant.  These estimates are consistent with
34:1177:103263:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:higher productivity brought by CBW in high-tech and knowledge intensive companies.  The par-
34:1178:103355:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ticularly strong effect in high-tech manufacturing is also consistent with the results in Ruffner
34:1179:103452:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Siegenthaler (2016) who show that CBW increased the R&D and the innovation done in
34:1180:103538:21:22:70:524:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms:  the  effects  they  found  were  particularly  strong  in  high-tech  firms.   Interestingly,  when
34:1181:103645:22:22:70:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we separate by skill, the positive wage effects in this sector seem stronger for middle- and less-
34:1182:103743:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated  native  workers  who  are  likely  to  be  complementary  to  the  technical  skills  of  CBW.
34:1183:103847:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:When  we  break  the  estimates  further  down  by  education  groups,  we  find  a  positive  wage  ef-

34:1186:104146:22:22:70:422:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experience a wage loss of around three percentage points near the border.

34:1188:104311:22:22:70:524:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Table  7,  on  log  of  hours  worked  by  natives.   These  captures  possible  shifts  in  labor  supply
34:1189:104417:22:0:70:524:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by  natives  in  response  to  CBW  across  those  sectors.   Expansion  and  increased  productivity
35:1190:104520:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at  the  sector  level  may  imply  a  larger  labor  supply  of  native  workers.   While  the  coefficients
35:1191:104629:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are mostly non-significant,  there is some evidence of a positive effect on the hours worked of
35:1192:104724:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:high-educated  in  high-tech  manufacturing  and  of  less-skilled  natives  in  services  that  are  not
35:1193:104829:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:knowledge-intensive.   This  last  effect  may  be  driven  by  positive  job-multiplier  effects  (as  de-
35:1194:104936:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:scribed by Moretti (2010)) on local, low-skill services, and support companies (e.g.  hotel, food,
35:1195:105034:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hospitality industries) attracted by the growth of high tech manufacturing and services.  The
35:1196:105127:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive effect on employment and zero (or even negative) effect on the wages of low-educated
35:1197:105220:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:natives in this sector is consistent with a highly elastic labor supply for these jobs that require
35:1198:105319:22:22:70:382:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very generic skills, and a possible negative selection in the sector.
35:1199:105388:22:21:87:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In all the existing regressions we have focused on private sector employment.  it is however
35:1200:105480:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interesting to mention another possible margin of adjustment.  In Appendix Table A8 we show
35:1201:105571:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the impact on employment in public sector workers.  These are estimated using data from the
35:1202:105662:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Swiss Business Census (BC), a different database, which includes, differently from the rest of the
35:1203:105760:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:paper, public-sector workers.  A significant effect shown in this table is the tendency of native
35:1204:105857:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers to move towards public sector jobs in response to CBW. There is a significant, albeit
35:1205:105950:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small, shift of about one percent of native employment moving from the private to the public
35:1206:106042:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sector  after  the  liberalization.   This  transition  could  be  an  additional  channel  through  which
35:1207:106148:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:natives  protected  their  wages  from  immigrant  competition,  as  native  have  easier  access  than
35:1208:106251:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:immigrants to public jobs.  We do not know of other studies that analyze this margin, which
35:1209:106342:22:38:70:292:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:can be important in some European countries.

35:1211:106416:29:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The positive productivity effect from CBW, consistent with higher wages and employment of
35:1212:106505:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:natives, and particularly clear in high tech manufacturing and knowledge intensive service sec-
35:1213:106600:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tor, may also derive from a complementarity of these workers with capital investments.  Their
35:1214:106693:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:presence,  and  the  perspective  of  hiring  them,  may  have  attracted  new  establishments  in  the
35:1215:106796:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:region  near  the  border,  producing  the  growth  of  employment  and  wages  we  observed.   The
35:1216:106895:22:22:70:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prospect of hiring the right type of workers can be a very strong attractor for firms and a key
35:1217:106990:22:22:70:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:driver of agglomeration economies (as in Moretti, 2004).  In Table 9 we consider the creation of
35:1218:107086:22:22:70:524:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:new establishment, as a share of total establishment in the sector in 1998, during the Transition
35:1219:107183:22:22:70:524:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:phase and during the Full Liberalization phase, in the four sectors considered above (high- and
35:1220:107278:22:22:70:524:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:low-tech manufacturing in columns (1) and (2), and sectors that were and were not knowledge-
35:1221:107370:22:0:70:524:71:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensive in columns (3) and (4)).  The estimates show the largest positive firm creation effects
36:1222:107469:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:during the Full Liberalization period (coefficients of the ”FREE” variable).  It appears that such
36:1223:107567:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm-creation was quite widespread across sectors, although stronger in high-tech manufacturing
36:1224:107662:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and in Knowledge-intensive services, in line with the previous results.  The aggregate effect is
36:1225:107758:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an additional creation of new establishments by 3.4 percent in the bin closest to the border, by
36:1226:107854:22:22:70:452:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2.8 percent in the bin at 20−30 minutes and a little bit less in the 10−20 bin.
36:1227:107933:22:22:87:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:During the Transition we also find a (smaller) effect of between one and two percent higher
36:1228:108024:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm-creation in aggregate.  This is consistent with the idea that anticipation of a larger supply
36:1229:108122:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  CBW  may  have  attracted  new  investment  and  new  firms  already  in  the  transition.   The
36:1230:108222:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sector distribution of the effects during the transition shows noisier and less precisely estimated
36:1231:108321:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coefficients.   It  suggests  that  the  high-tech  manufacturing  and  service  sector  experienced  the
36:1232:108426:21:22:70:508:555:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:largest entry of new establishments relative to the initial number of firms in these sectors.43

36:1234:108609:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bility have not played a particularly relevant role in response to the opening to CBW. Instead,

36:1237:108905:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:especially  during  the  phase  of  full  mobility.   Together  these  channels  are  consistent  with  the
36:1238:109012:22:38:70:479:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage increase of highly skilled natives estimated after allowing free mobility of CBW.

36:1240:109143:29:22:70:524:356:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Before concluding,  we systematically compare our results with those of two recent papers re-
36:1241:109236:22:22:70:524:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lated to this one and point out similarities and differences.  The first study from Ruffner and
36:1242:109331:22:22:70:524:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Siegenthaler (2016) was developed concurrently to this paper and focuses on the same episode of
36:1243:109426:22:22:70:524:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:liberalization in Switzerland.  Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) use firm-level data and focus on
36:1244:109522:22:21:70:524:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm outcomes:  labor productivity, sales, R&D investments, innovation, and firm entry and exit
36:1245:109617:21:22:70:524:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after CBW liberalization.  They provide results that are complementary to those presented in
36:1246:109709:22:22:70:524:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this paper.  First, they show that firms close to the border experienced an increase in aggregate
36:1247:109806:22:22:70:524:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment and an expansion in sales and a mild increase in productivity post-liberalization.
36:1248:109899:22:22:70:524:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The authors also document that firms expressing worries about shortages of highly-skilled work-
36:1249:109994:22:22:70:524:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ers  in  the  pre-liberalization  period  (via  a  survey)  experienced  larger  increase  in  sales  and  in
36:1250:110103:22:22:70:524:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value-added per workers following the liberalization.  This confirms that the expansion of CBW
36:1251:110197:22:22:70:524:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:supply may have facilitated growth, investment, and productivity gains.  Second, firms that ben-
36:1252:110293:22:16:70:524:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:efited most with respect to productivity and growth were those in the high-tech sector, larger
36:1253:110387:16:15:79:524:77:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:43These results complement the findings of Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) who also find positive effects on
36:1254:110495:15:0:70:354:62:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:firm entry and no robust effects on firm exit close to the Swiss border.
37:1255:110569:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms, and those previously dependent on cross-border workers.  This result is consistent with
37:1256:110663:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the stronger positive wage effects we find on high-tech manufacturing workers (Table 7).  Third,
37:1257:110759:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) find that firms also experienced larger innovation rates, larger
37:1258:110855:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment shares in R&D, and more entry of new establishments as a consequence of CBW
37:1259:110941:22:22:70:135:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:liberalization.
37:1260:110956:22:22:87:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  paper,  on  the  other  hand,  goes  much  more  in  depth  into  the  analysis  of  the  labor
37:1261:111056:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:market dynamics triggered by the opening of the border.  First, it shows that CBW were highly
37:1262:111149:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated and did not crowd out other immigrants, but increased total foreign-born employment,
37:1263:111242:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:especially of highly-skilled.  Second we show that they triggered dynamics through which highly-
37:1264:111338:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:educated local workers were more likely to become top managers and stay in the municipality,
37:1265:111430:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:while  internal  mobility  of  Swiss  workers  was  not  affected  much.   Third  our  analysis  suggests
37:1266:111535:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that,  possibly  because  of  a  positive  local  job  multiplier  (as  in  Moretti  (2010))  from  CBW,
37:1267:111639:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  employment  and  wages  in  high-tech  manufacturing  and  knowledge-intensive  services  was
37:1268:111737:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positively  affected.   What  both  studies  suggest  is  the  fact  that  the  absorption  of  new  CBW
37:1269:111841:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after 2004 took place via job and firm creation and increased productivity, innovation, and total
37:1270:111938:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment.  Our analysis also unveils a more detailed account of who gained and who lost from
37:1271:112032:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  opening  of  the  border  among  Swiss  workers.   Older,  highly-educated,  male  workers  with
37:1272:112133:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:longer tenure  were  the  main beneficiaries,  as they  took managerial jobs  in response to CBW
37:1273:112229:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inflow.   Importantly,  these  positive  effects  may  be  connected  to  the  fact  that  the  new  CBW
37:1274:112333:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were highly skilled, that the growth in their supply had a transition period (1999-2004), during
37:1275:112429:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which firms could prepare their adjustment.  The fact that we document also some positive firm
37:1276:112523:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:creation during the transition phase confirms this conjecture.  Hence, in evaluating the impact
37:1277:112618:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of immigration policy changes and the consequences of the ensuing inflow of immigrants, this
37:1278:112710:21:22:70:245:270:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:episode may be particularly useful.44
37:1279:112747:22:22:87:524:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A second paper with important similarity to ours, especially for the type of policy considered,
37:1280:112842:22:22:70:524:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  Dustmann,  Sch ̈onberg  and  Stuhler  (2017).   The  authors  analyze  the  effect  of  a  temporary
37:1281:112946:22:22:70:524:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:agreement allowing the free access of cross-border workers from the Czech Republic to Germany
37:1282:113039:22:22:70:524:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between 1991 and 1993.  This agreement followed the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe,
37:1283:113127:22:22:70:524:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  increased  the  presence  of  Czech  workers  in  the  bordering  German  regions.   Similarly  to
37:1284:113230:22:16:70:524:138:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  Swiss  case,  the  effect  on  labor  supply  was  highly  concentrated  near  the  border  because
37:1285:113334:16:15:79:524:122:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:44It is somewhat harder to reconcile our results with the initial policy report by Losa, Bigotta and Gonzales
37:1286:113443:15:11:70:524:107:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(2012) that looked at the employment and wage effects of removing barriers on CBW. That paper applied a simple
37:1287:113553:11:11:70:524:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:difference-in-difference approach between border and non-border regions and it focused on the short run effects
37:1288:113664:11:11:70:524:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(2 years after the policy).  Such an approach can incur significant noise and measurement error as we documented
37:1289:113776:11:11:70:524:74:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:that the changes in CBW took a few years since 2004 and that only the municipalities closest to the border (rather
37:1290:113890:11:0:70:392:63:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:than the whole border region) experienced a significant increase in their supply.
38:1291:113973:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the commuting requirement.  Yet,  Dustmann,  Sch ̈onberg and Stuhler (2017) find that this
38:1292:114066:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inflow was associated with a large decline in the employment of old, unskilled Germans and a
38:1293:114158:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:larger decline in wages of younger workers.  The authors explain these differences with different
38:1294:114255:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:degrees of rigidity of wages and elasticity of supply of different age groups.  Our findings are
38:1295:114351:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:particularly interesting in light of these results.  However, it must be born in mind that there are
38:1296:114451:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:three main differences between the German set-up and the Swiss case.  First, the Czech inflow
38:1297:114544:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was mainly composed of less-educated workers hired in relatively manual-intensive occupations.
38:1298:114638:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Second,  it  was  unexpected  and  not  planned  years  in  advance.   Third,  it  wastemporary,  and
38:1299:114739:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:perceived as such, and it was reversed in 1993.  Each of these features may have reduced the
38:1300:114831:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:response  margin  of  native  workers  and  firms,  limiting  the  ability  to  absorb  the  new  workers
38:1301:114936:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  hence  these  differences  may  contribute  to  explain  the  different  labor  market  effects  on
38:1302:115040:22:22:70:524:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:natives:  negative in the   case of Dustmann, Sch ̈onberg and Stuhler (2017), and positive in our
38:1303:115137:22:22:70:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:case.  Dustmann, Sch ̈onberg and Stuhler (2017) also discuss the main channels of adjustment of
38:1304:115232:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:native employment, which seems to be a reduction of other natives moving to those regions.  This
38:1305:115328:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:seems plausible because the region near the border with the Czech Republic, due to the turmoil
38:1306:115422:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:created by the end of Communism, may have experienced more economic uncertainty and less
38:1307:115510:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:growth than other regions around 1991-1992.  The Swiss experiment, instead, took place around
38:1308:115603:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2004, a period in which the countries near the border were not experiencing significant economic
38:1309:115699:22:22:70:524:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:transitions.   Hence  it  may  be  a  cleaner  case  to  isolate  the  effect  of  apermanent  immigration
38:1310:115805:22:22:70:524:357:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:reformon local labor markets, avoiding other economic spillover effects from across the border.
38:1311:115900:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Also  the  high  skills  of  immigrants  and  the  different  horizon  of  the  policy  may  be  crucial  to
38:1312:116008:22:22:70:524:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explain our positive results on native wages.  More generally, however, we cannot make a strong
38:1313:116103:22:21:70:524:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statement  about  which  feature  of  the  Swiss  set-up  generated  the  difference  for  the  effect  on
38:1314:116209:21:46:70:428:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes we observe vis-`a-vis the German-Czech set-up in the early 1990s.
38:1315:116283:46:33:70:171:224:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:7    Conclusion
38:1316:116298:33:22:70:524:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In  this  paper,  we  analyze  the  effect  of  liberalization  of  labor  market  access  for  cross-border
38:1317:116406:22:22:70:524:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers,  implemented  in  Switzerland  between  1999  and  2007,  on  the  labor  supply  of  foreign
38:1318:116508:22:21:70:524:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers  and  on  native  labor  market  outcomes.   We  adopt  a  difference-in-difference  approach
38:1319:116609:21:22:70:524:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and we exploit the fact that the availability of cross-border workers strongly depended on the
38:1320:116703:22:22:70:524:104:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:commuting  time  from  the  national  border,  as  these  workers  resided  abroad  and  commuted
38:1321:116800:22:22:70:524:82:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  work  in  Switzerland.   After  showing  that  the  introduction  of  free  labor  market  access  for
38:1322:116906:22:0:70:524:60:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these workers in 2004 produced a progressive and significant increase in their employment in
39:1323:117000:0:22:70:524:774:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:municipalities within 0−20 minutes of travel time from the border, but very little effect beyond
39:1324:117096:22:22:70:524:752:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:30  minutes  from  the  border,  we  analyze  their  impact  on  labor  market  outcomes  of  natives.
39:1325:117198:22:22:70:524:730:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We find that, in the aggregate, natives in municipalities within the 0−20 minute range from
39:1326:117289:22:22:70:524:708:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the border did not experience any differential change in average log wages, log employment, or
39:1327:117383:22:22:70:524:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:log hours after the liberalization relative to natives in similar municipalities farther away from
39:1328:117481:22:22:70:524:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the border.  However, this insignificant post-liberalization change in averages masks a positive
39:1329:117577:22:22:70:524:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and significant change in the wages of highly-educated natives.  This effect is the strongest and
39:1330:117674:22:22:70:524:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:most robust estimate in the paper.  We also find a positive but less robust and only marginally
39:1331:117769:22:22:70:524:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant positive change on hours worked by less-educated natives in the region near the border
39:1332:117867:22:21:70:524:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after liberalization.  To better understand these results, we analyze several margins and channels
39:1333:117965:21:22:70:524:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of adjustment for native workers that may explain the positive wage change for highly-educated
39:1334:118059:22:22:70:522:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:natives, which is not consistent with a increase in supply in the canonical labor market model.
39:1335:118154:22:22:87:524:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We rule out internal migration as a significant adjustment mechanism, and provide suggestive
39:1336:118246:22:22:70:524:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence  on  three  interesting  mechanisms  that  seem  to  be  at  work  in  response  to  the  higher
39:1337:118351:22:22:70:524:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:supply  of  CBW.  First,  we  find  evidence  that  highly-educated  natives,  and  particularly  older
39:1338:118454:22:22:70:524:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  more  senior  workers,  became  more  likely  to  take  top  management  positions.   Second  we
39:1339:118555:22:22:70:524:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:find  positive  productivity  (wage)  effects  in  the  high-tech  manufacturing  sector  and  in  skilled
39:1340:118661:22:22:70:524:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:services, where the employment of skilled CBW increased the most.  Third, we find more new
39:1341:118751:22:22:70:355:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm creation in the border regions after Full Liberalization.
39:1342:118813:22:22:87:524:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Overall,  this  suggests  that  the  CBW  produced  positive  effects  on  local,  highly-educated
39:1343:118911:22:22:70:524:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers, through both a complementarity and a productivity channel, by pushing some of them
