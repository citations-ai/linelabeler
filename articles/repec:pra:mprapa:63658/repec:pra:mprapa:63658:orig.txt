3:41:713:19:19:72:526:661:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f6:Purpose: The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  discuss  the  current  state  of  higher  education,  high-impact 
3:42:826:19:19:72:526:642:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:research  and  university  rankings  in Asian  emerging  market-India. Firstly, overview  of  higher 
3:43:926:19:19:72:523:623:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:education  and  government  schemes  for  academic  research  is presented.  Secondly,  progress  of  high-
3:44:1033:19:19:72:526:604:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:impact research in India and China for citable documents, number of citations, cites per document and 
3:45:1135:19:19:72:526:585:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:H-index  in  three subject categories  is  assessed.  Lastly,  we  discuss  potential  challenges  in  the 
3:46:1242:19:19:72:491:566:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:university education and recommend policy guidelines for betterment of the existing practices.

3:48:1336:19:19:72:525:528:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f6:Methodology: Being  a  qualitative  study  we  have  collected data  from  archival  sources  and  thereby 
3:49:1442:19:19:72:360:509:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:accomplished our goals based on inductive and deductive logics.

3:51:1505:19:19:72:526:471:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f6:Findings: Overall, Chinese universities are found to be outperforming Indian universities, especially 
3:52:1606:19:19:72:526:452:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:in citable documents, number of citations, international collaboration, collaborative research projects, 
3:53:1711:19:19:72:526:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:publications  and  editorship,  and  university  rankings.  For  citable  documents  in  all  subjects  category, 
3:54:1825:19:19:72:525:414:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f11:United  States is ranked 1st, followed by China 2nd, United Kingdom 3rd ..., and India 9th. We 
3:55:1920:19:19:72:525:395:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:therefore suggest that individual-, university- and country-specific factors have significant impact on 
3:56:2023:19:19:72:170:376:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:high-impact research.

3:58:2044:19:19:72:526:338:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f6:Research   limitations: The   study is restricted   to   India.   Hence,   conducting   a   survey   among 
3:59:2149:19:19:72:525:319:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:government  and private universities  with  regard  to  academics  and  research  assessment  measures 
3:60:2251:19:19:72:184:300:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:deserves future research.

4:78:3192:21:20:275:529:634:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:- Dr. Manmohan Singh, Ex-Prime Minister of India

4:80:3266:21:21:72:165:593:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:On the other hand, 
4:81:3284:21:21:108:526:572:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:“By  2030,  India  will  be  amongst  the youngest  nations  in  the  world  with  nearly  140 
4:82:3378:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:million people in the college-going age  group, one in every  four  graduates in the world will 
4:83:3474:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:be  a  product  of  the  Indian  education  system  (Times  of  India,  2014), fifty  percent  of  youth 
4:84:3579:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:would be in the higher education system, at least 23 Indian universities would be among the

4:86:3763:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:would be among top five countries globally in cited research output, its research capabilities 
4:87:3857:21:21:72:477:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:boosted by annual R&D spends totaling over US$140 billion” (Businessline, 2014). 
4:88:3936:21:20:72:75:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
4:89:3936:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:From  the  aforementioned  comments,  one  would  notice  two  opposing  views that  associated 
4:90:4032:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with the higher education system in  India. Firstly, reaction but disagreement to the progress 
4:91:4125:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  higher  education  system,  research  contribution  and  university  rankings.  Secondly,  how 
4:92:4224:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:should  we  establish  better-structured,  managed  and  excelled  higher  educational  systems 
4:93:4320:20:21:72:525:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:while   scrubbing-out contaminated procedures,   controlling   malpractices   and   removing 
4:94:4412:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:politicking-abuse  within  it,  thus  to  place  the  governance-based, objective-oriented  higher 
4:95:4510:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education  system  on  the  world  map.  Albeit,  second  comment  seems  be un(realistic) goals 
4:96:4606:20:21:72:525:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with some fancy numbers, audaciousness whilst more on to protect self-respect of the ruling 
4:97:4696:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:political   party. Being   stated   that,   one   should   aim   high   and   work   prudently   for   the 
4:98:4802:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:development  of  the  country.  Overall, the  outcome will  have  positive  impact on  economic 
4:99:4896:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:progress,  employment,  foreign  collaboration,  capital  mobilization  and  entrepreneurship. As 
4:100:4993:21:21:72:525:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:such, it is also a fact that institutional environment, economic resources and human resources 
4:101:5088:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:are important drivers of higher education and high-impact research (Xie et al., 2014; Zoogah 
4:102:5177:21:20:72:135:137:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:et al., 2015). 
4:103:5190:20:21:108:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Generally speaking, higher education degree is the most fundamental constituent that 
4:104:5273:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:needs careful attention and evaluation to foresee any outcome in the given country. It is truly 
4:105:5369:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:a  reward  for  citizens, gives  knowledge  and  respect,  makes  self-assured and  provides 
5:106:5463:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:opportunity that is more relevant. Taking forward, number of admissions and job market are 
5:107:5554:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:increasingly  becoming  more  challenging  due  to  structural  problems  in  the  governance 
5:108:5648:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:system,  self-benefitting  advantages  with  bureaucrats  and politically  influencing  manners. 
5:109:5744:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Importantly, a blend of teaching and research is almost a demanding task in higher education 
5:110:5836:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that associated  with  developing  countries  in  South  Asia  and  African  continentals,  and  being 
5:111:5939:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:placing in  world  university  rankings  is  a highly  rewarded gift  for  a  number  of  state-run  and 
5:112:6043:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:private  universities.  In  this  vein, Indian higher  education has  been evolved  and progressed 
5:113:6141:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:during post-independence era. Thus far, government of India has mainly targeted a few areas 
5:114:6230:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in  higher  education,  for  instance, setting-up  national  importance  institutes (e.g., Indian 
5:115:6325:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Institute  of  Technology, National  Institute  of  Technology,  Indian  Institute  of  Management), 
5:116:6426:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:providing  financial  assistance  to  state-run  universities,  teacher training  institutes,  quality 
5:117:6529:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:measures   in   admissions,   job   market   assistance   and   producing Ph.D.s   for   teaching 
5:118:6626:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:requirements,  among  others.  Unfortunately,  Indian  institutes have never been  focused  on 
5:119:6721:21:20:72:525:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:industry collaboration, high-impact research, number of citations and university rankings, but 
5:120:6815:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:they  are  known about  national-level quality  measures such  as National  Assessment  and 
5:121:6906:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Accreditation Council (NAAC) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA) certifications. In 
5:122:6993:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:fact, local institutes always thrive for admissions, central  government  grants, pay  scales and 
5:123:7091:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:increments, and  national  assessment.  In  other  words, a  number  of  government  and  private 
5:124:7188:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities could  not  pay  attention  to  global university  rankings because  of problems that 
5:125:7286:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:exist in  financial  assistance,  research  infrastructure,  research  skills  of  supervisors  and  of 
5:126:7389:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:course, research interest. While supporting this, most Indian universities are lacking research 
5:127:7483:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:culture because  of high  importance  that  given  to  teaching requirements and  number  of 
5:128:7576:21:21:72:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:admissions. Further, one would certainly notice increasing number of private universities for 
5:129:7669:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:last  five  years,  quality  and  quantity  contradictions,  unethical  practices  in the university 
5:130:7770:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assessment, outdated policies in technical education, etc. Conversely, one would also find the 
5:131:7863:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:India’s real  contribution in higher  education when  compare  to  the  progress  of  higher 
5:132:7954:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education and  research  output in  China.  For  example,  Xie et  al. (2014)  describe  four 
5:133:8045:20:21:72:525:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:important factors that drive China in scientific research: a large population and human capital 
5:134:8139:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:base,  a  labor  market  favoring  academic  meritocracy,  a  large  diaspora  of  Chinese-origin 
5:135:8237:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:scientists  and  a  centralized  government  willing  to invest  in  science. Being  realized by  these 
5:136:8339:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:institutional experiences, India’s newly elected government aims to establish best practices of 
5:137:8435:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:excellence  and  inclusiveness and  highest  standards  of  ethics  and  accountability  across 
5:138:8531:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university  education, and  work  towards placing  local  universities  in  the global  university 
5:139:8629:21:0:72:220:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:rankings (Businessline, 2014). 
6:140:8659:0:21:108:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:With this in mind, the paper sets three goals. First, it presents the overview of higher 
6:141:8747:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education  system  in  India  and  government  initiatives  for  conducting  academic  research. 
6:142:8844:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Second, it reports the current state of high-impact academic research (e.g., citable documents, 
6:143:8939:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:number  of  citations,  cites  per  documents  and  H-index;  indexing  and  abstracting  of  local 
6:144:9039:20:21:72:525:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:journals) in  India  compared  to  neighboring Asian country-China  and  comments  on  Indian 
6:145:9132:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  ranking  in  the  world  university  rankings.  Lastly  but  importantly,  we  discuss 
6:146:9233:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:potential  challenges  that  embedded  in  the  existing  higher  education  and  academic  research, 
6:147:9335:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and suggest policy recommendations for betterment of academic practices, research skills and 
6:148:9425:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university environment. Hence,   no   earlier   study   claims   our   research   objectives   and 
6:149:9524:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:contribution to the literature. Therefore, findings of the study would have a greater impact on 
6:150:9618:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:policy development, university teaching, industry collaboration, high-impact research, global 
6:151:9712:20:21:72:276:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university rankings and national progress. 
6:152:9754:21:21:108:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The  remainder  of  the  paper  proceeds  as  follows. Section  2  presents  research  design 
6:153:9847:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and organization of thoughts. Section 3 outlines overview of higher education system in India 
6:154:9940:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and outlines different government fellowships for academic research. Section 4 discusses the 
6:155:10032:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:current  state  of high-impact  research and  related  issues  in  India.  Section  5  reports  global 
6:156:10135:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university  rankings  with  regard  to  Indian  universities.  Section  6  explains  various  challenges 
6:157:10240:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in higher education and  academic research, and suggests policy  guidelines for betterment of 
6:158:10332:21:21:72:317:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the system. Finally, Section 7 concludes the study. 
6:159:10383:21:21:72:75:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
6:160:10383:21:20:72:260:344:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:2. Research design and organization 
6:161:10418:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The  main  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  discuss  the  progress  of  higher  education,  high-impact 
6:162:10520:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  and  university  rankings  in  India.  To  do  so,  we  have  created  an  interdisciplinary 
6:163:10623:21:20:72:525:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research setting by linking inductive and deductive logics based on archival sources (Reddy, 
6:164:10715:20:21:72:525:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:2015; Reddy  and  Agrawal,  2012). It allows  us  to  draw  various  imperative  conclusions.  For 
6:165:10813:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:example, it presents not only the evolution of higher education system but also discusses the 
6:166:10906:21:20:72:525:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:level  of  academic  research and  innovation  by  making  connection  to  university  rankings.  It 
6:167:11007:20:21:72:525:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:eventually  helps  us  to explore a  number  of challenges  and  opportunities  in  the  higher 
6:168:11101:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education  governance  and  control  mechanisms, and  to  suggest  fruitful  policy  guidelines  for 
6:169:11201:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:betterment  of  existing  practices.  Being  stated  that,  a  number  of  earlier  studies refer  to  India 
6:170:11310:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:have reviewed   and statistics   on   higher   education   has   collected   from   the   respective 
6:171:11411:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government organizations such  as Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development  (MHRD), 
6:172:11495:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Universities  Grants  Commission  (UGC) and All  India  Council  for  Technical  Education 
6:173:11585:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(AICTE). Regarding high-impact research, we have used ‘country-based research and citation 
7:174:11676:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:ranking  list’ from  SCImago – an  official  source  of research  and  citation  metrics.  Thus,  four 
7:175:11775:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:metrics are  being  assessed:  citable  documents,  number  of  citations,  cites  per  document  and 
7:176:11876:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:H-index  in  three  categories- (i)  all  subjects,  (ii)  business,  management  and  accounting,  and 
7:177:11979:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(iii)  economics,  econometrics and  finance. The Times  Higher  Education  (THE)  World 
7:178:12065:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:University Rankings list for 2014-15 has been used in order to make an appropriate comment 
7:179:12155:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:on  the  performance  of  Indian  universities  compared  to  neighboring  country  universities. 
7:180:12252:21:20:72:525:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Lastly,  we  have  surveyed abstracting  and  indexing  of  Indian  and  Chinese  journals  through 
7:181:12351:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:browsing world’s leading publishers include Elsevier,  Emerald,  John  Wiley,  Springer  and

7:185:12619:20:21:72:319:531:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:3. Overview of higher education system in India 
7:186:12665:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Indian higher education has long been criticized for various reasons include quality in course 
7:187:12760:21:20:72:525:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:content,   shortage   of   excelled   teaching   faculty, lack   of   research   interest,   be   short   of 
7:188:12869:20:21:72:525:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infrastructure  facilities,  insufficient  financial  support,  industry-centric  skills,  international 
7:189:12974:21:21:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:collaborations, and  research  output  and  number  of  citations. By  and  large,  it  is because  of 
7:190:13076:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:high-level  government  control  over  administration,  admissions,  examinations, recruitment 
7:191:13171:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  assessment. Nevertheless,  a  number  of  systems  and  practices  in  higher  education  have 
7:192:13271:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:been  redefined,  redesigned and  transformed since  the  entry  of  private  university  degree 
7:193:13367:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:system  due  to  liberalization  and  globalization  of  the  economy.  It  infers  that  economic 
7:194:13466:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:deregulation  and  integration  policies  not  only  influence  the  economic  performance  of  the 
7:195:13566:20:21:72:403:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:country but also influence the assorted sectors like higher education. 
7:196:13635:21:21:108:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Being stated that, Indian higher education is referred as the third largest in the world 
7:197:13723:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:after US and China, which has great potential to compete with global universities (Times of 
7:198:13814:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:India,  2014). Main participants of  the  system  include  national  importance  institutes,  central 
7:199:13913:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities,  state  universities,  deemed-to-be  universities,  private  universities,  autonomous 
7:200:14014:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:institutes and supporting institutes. According to MHRD, “number of universities has notably 
7:201:14107:20:21:72:525:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:increased  from  20  in  1950  at  3285%,  to  677  in  2014,  which  consists  of  51  institutions  of 
7:202:14212:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:national  importance  (16  IITs,  30  NITs  and  5  IISERs),  45  central  universities, 318 state 
7:203:14310:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities, 185 state private universities, 129 deemed to be universities and four institutions 
7:204:14408:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:established  under  various state  legislations. Further,  number  of  registered  colleges  has 
7:205:14505:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:remarkably increased  from  500  in  1950  at  7341%,  to  37204  in  2013-March”.  These  figures 
7:206:14604:21:21:72:525:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infer  that  the  government  of  India has paid a  greater attention  to  the  development  of  higher 
7:207:14707:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education for benefitting the larger population. According to UGC annual report 2012-13 (as 
8:208:14800:0:21:72:525:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  March),  Tamil  Nadu has registered with  highest number  of  universities-79,  followed  by 
8:209:14895:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Uttar   Pradesh-56,   Rajasthan-56   and   Andhra   Pradesh   43,   among   others. Total student 
8:210:14991:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:enrolment  in  all  courses  in  regular  stream has reached  215.01  lakhs  (93.06  lakhs  female 
8:211:15090:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(43.28%)). Thus, Uttar Pradesh has enrolled with maximum number of students-33.65 lakhs, 
8:212:15179:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:followed  by  Maharashtra-24.57  lakhs,  Tamil  Nadu-20.38  lakhs,  and  Andhra  Pradesh-20.14 
8:213:15274:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:lakhs, just to cite a few. Number of teaching faculty has reached 9.51 lakhs in which 82.5% 
8:214:15365:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:teachers   are   working   in   colleges   and   remaining   17.5%   are   working   in   universities. 
8:215:15469:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Importantly, number of Ph.D. recipients totaled to 17631 in which Faculty of Arts (Faculty of 
8:216:15562:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Science)  has awarded  higher  number  of  research  degrees- 5642 (5607),  followed  by  faculty

8:219:15851:20:21:72:265:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Ph.D. recipients over the last few years. 
8:220:15892:21:21:108:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Other appealing observations  include  (i)  growth  of  student  enrolment  (including 
8:221:15978:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  degrees- M.Phil  and  Ph.D.s)  has  massively  increased  from  3404096  in  1984-85  to 
8:222:16076:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:8399443 in 2000-01, and then reached 21501154 in 2012-2013; (ii) number and distribution

12:349:25323:20:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We develop this section based on the recent viewpoint articles (Gruber, 2014; Zoogah et al., 
12:350:25414:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:2015), SCImago’s country research metrics  and  Indian  research environment.  We  therefore 
12:351:25507:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:present  our  thoughts  in  four  main  strands  such  as  importance  of  academic  scholarship, 
12:352:25605:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:determinants  of  high-impact  research,  country-based  research metrics, and abstracting  and 
12:353:25700:21:21:72:208:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:indexing of Indian journals. 
12:354:25728:21:20:72:75:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
12:355:25728:20:21:72:202:531:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:4.1 Academic scholarship 
12:356:25752:21:21:72:525:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Academic  scholarship  is  the  most  important  intellectual  asset  of  a  faculty,  university  and 
12:357:25855:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:nation. Indeed,  research  scholarship  is  a  continuous  job  influenced  by  a  set  of  motives  and 
12:358:25960:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:requirements  of  institutions  for  discovering  new  knowledge  that  led  to  simplify  the  human 
12:359:26062:21:21:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:life. By  and  large,  research  is  a  determination  of “search  and  re-search” as  to  explore  new 
12:360:26164:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:findings  for  defining  the  new  order  of  the  world. Extant  scholars  define  the  scholarship  for 
12:361:26269:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:various reasons. For example, Boyer (1990) suggested that “scholarship involves discovery - 
12:362:26360:21:21:72:525:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:original  research  that  advances  knowledge;  integration - synthesis  of  information  across 
12:363:26456:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:disciplines,  across  topics  within  a  discipline,  or  across  time;  application - the rigor and 
12:364:26555:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:application of disciplinary expertise with results that can be shared with and/or evaluated by 
12:365:26650:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:academic peers and  appreciated by the non-academic world; and teaching and learning - the 
12:366:26740:21:21:72:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:systematic study of teaching and learning processes” (cf.  Zoogah et al., 2015).  In particular, 
12:367:26835:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:academic   research at university-level   not   only   helps   faculty   members   in   receiving 
12:368:26932:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government grants but also helps them in publishing research as well as teaching courses. As 
12:369:27024:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:such,  a  blend  of  theory  and  industry-oriented  research  enriches  the  classroom  experience 
12:370:27124:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:among  faculty  and  students,  especially  in  management  discipline.  Importantly,  research 
12:371:27220:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:findings  would  have  significant  impact  on  government  policy  making  and  social  issues.  For 
12:372:27322:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:example,  findings of  the research  on road  accidents in  metropolitan  cities help  concerned 
12:373:27416:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:ministry   of   the   government,   city   police,   society   and   higher   education   institutions   in 
12:374:27524:21:20:72:525:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:preventing  road  accidents  and  improving  safety  measures. Overall,  research  is a  form  of 
12:375:27621:20:21:72:504:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:intangible asset (e.g. patents, research papers, books) of a faculty, university and country.

13:379:27756:20:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Secondly, high-impact research has distinct meaning in different disciplines (Jie et al., 2008). 
13:380:27851:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:For  example,  research  on  causes  of  cancer  in  medical  sciences  should  be  at  high-level  that 
13:381:27956:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:requires financial  support,  a  pool  of  talented  medical  scientists,  and  physical  and  scientific 
13:382:28061:20:21:72:525:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infrastructure. Then,  findings  of  the  research  will be  eventually  published  in  referred 
13:383:28156:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:international  journals,  for  example, Nature, Science, New England  Journal  of  Medicine. 
13:384:28248:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Conversely,  high-impact research in management discipline can be defined as “an  approved 
13:385:28339:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:project  that  is  meaningful  to  industry, helps  in  managerial  decision  making  and  government 
13:386:28441:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:policy  making,  which  can  be  published  in  top-ranked  journal, for  example, Academy  of 
13:387:28536:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Management Journal, Journal of Finance. Nevertheless, one has to remember that publishing 
13:388:28625:21:20:72:525:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  in  high-quality  journals  is  the  only  measure  to  assess  the  performance  of  a  faculty 
13:389:28732:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:and university (Zoogah et al., 2015). Further, Zoogah et. also described “three characteristics 
13:390:28825:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of high-impact   research:   problematization   (diagnoses   economic,   social,   and   technical 
13:391:28924:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:problems  with  the  purpose  of  generating  meaningful  solutions),  focus  (directs  the  empirical 
13:392:29027:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:lens at the specific problem with laser-precision to achieve valid and reliable outcomes), and 
13:393:29122:21:21:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:contextuality (distinguishes temporal, physical, and psychological contextual features so as to 
13:394:29217:21:20:72:339:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:minimize errors and to maximize the desired effects)”.  
13:395:29272:20:21:108:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Based  on the former  and  later illustrative  experiences  we  perceive  that  high-impact 
13:396:29363:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  is  an  essential  task  of disseminating  research  findings  through  publishing it in  a 
13:397:29465:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:reputable journal and is irrelevant whether the project was received grants or not from either 
13:398:29560:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government or industry. Thus, reputable journal refers to the publishing outlet or place  with 
13:399:29654:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:international  outlook,  editorial  broad,  mission  and  objectives,  blind  review  system, highly 
13:400:29755:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:accessed and highly cited. This is further extended to “indexed in Thomson Reuters ISI-SCI 
13:401:29844:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  highest impact factor” (total number of citations against number of published papers). 
13:402:29934:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We  then  explain  various  determinants  of  high-impact  research:  individual-specific  factors 
13:403:30033:21:21:72:525:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(e.g.,  educational  qualification,  job  profile,  university  affiliation,  level  of  research  skills, 
13:404:30140:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:knowledge of research methods, writing and presentation skills, personal motivation, filed of

13:406:30335:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infrastructure, research culture, data access, training and workshops on research publications, 
13:407:30429:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  assistance,  financial  support, international  collaborations, incentives  for  research 
13:408:30528:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publications,  teaching  load,  coordination  among  various  departments,  political  and  social 
13:409:30627:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:behaviour,  university  policies  with  regard  to  faculty  appointment  and  promotion);  and 
13:410:30723:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:country-specific  factors  (e.g., institutional  environment,  level  of  government  involvement  in 
13:411:30825:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university  administration,  level  of  political  intervention,  government  budgeting  for  higher 
14:412:30928:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education,  tax  incentives  on  research  grants  and  income,  postdoctoral  research  fellowships, 
14:413:31030:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:collaborative  research  grants,  bilateral  agreements). Altogether,  high-impact  research  not 
14:414:31127:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:only helps in publishing it in a journal with highest impact factor but also attracts a number of 
14:415:31224:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:citations.  For  example, a  special  issue  of Long  Range  Planning on  “business  models” 
14:416:31315:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:published in 2010 is the most exciting case in management discipline. As of 2013, the special 
14:417:31409:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:issue  has  attracted  more  than  150,000  downloads  and  more  than  3,500  Google Scholar  and 
14:418:31508:21:20:72:384:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:more than 500 ISI citations (Baden-Fuller and Haefliger, 2013).  
14:419:31572:20:21:108:525:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Hence,  there  is  no rule-based approach  that  the  paper  published  in  a  journal  with 
14:420:31664:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:highest  impact  factor  receives  highest  number  of  citations.  Again,  number  of  citations  is 
14:421:31766:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:influenced  by  various  factors  that  responsible  for  journal  outlook, open  access, journal 
14:422:31864:21:20:72:525:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:subscriptions, speed in publishing the  forward-looking  research, level of interest in the field 
14:423:31962:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(e.g., business  models,  corporate  governance),  and progress  in the research  field  (e.g., 
14:424:32055:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:emerging markets, US, UK), among others (e.g., Bernius, 2010). Albeit, one has to consider 
14:425:32142:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that managing research projects and publishing papers in journals with good impact factor are 
14:426:32236:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:two  different  tasks  in  academic  environment. Though, academic  fraternity should also 
14:427:32326:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:remember  that  spreading  knowledge  through  publishing  it  in  high-quality  journals  (and, 
14:428:32423:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:books)  is  not  an  easy-doing  job. It has  greater value  than  low-impact  research  that indeed 
14:429:32520:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:influences the university rankings. Referring to management discipline, we come across three

14:436:33016:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We  present publishing  research metrics during  1996-2013 for top  20  countries  in three 
14:437:33106:21:21:72:525:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:categories:  (i)  all  subjects,  (ii)  business,  management  and  accounting (BMA),  and  (iii) 
14:438:33203:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:economics,  econometrics  and  finance (EEF) (Table  1).  Thus,  we  discuss four important 
14:439:33292:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:metrics such as citable documents, number of citations, citations per document and H-index. 
14:440:33382:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:For citable documents in all subjects category, United States has been ranked 1st, followed by 
14:441:33477:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:China 2nd, United Kingdom 3rd ..., and India 9th. For citable documents in BMA category, 
14:442:33566:21:20:72:525:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:United States has been ranked 1st, followed by United Kingdom 2nd, China 3rd ..., and India 
14:443:33658:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:7th. For citable documents in EEF category, United States has been ranked 1st, followed by 
14:444:33749:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:United Kingdom 2nd ..., China 8th ..., and India 12th. Further, H-index  for China  in all 
14:445:33840:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:subjects  (436),  BMA  (83)  and EEF  (74)  is  significantly  higher  than  H-index for  India (341, 
15:446:33942:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:66, and 57). We also show trend line of  category-based metrics for China and  India (Figure 
15:447:34033:21:21:72:525:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:1). In  case  of  citable  documents  to  all  subjects,  the  speed  in  rate  of  growth  for  China  was 
15:448:34141:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:better  than  the  speed  in  rate  of  growth  for  India.  Hence,  there were different  trend  lines for 
15:449:34248:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:both countries in BMA and EEF categories. For number of cites and cites per document in all 
15:450:34340:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:subjects  category,  trend  line  of  Chinese  and  Indian  publishing  research has  represented 
15:451:34437:21:21:72:525:655:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:‘raising yet declining’ sharply, especially after the year 2008. While, mixed performance was 
15:452:34530:21:21:72:236:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:noticed for remaining categories.

15:454:34585:20:21:242:355:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:[Insert Figure 1 here] 
15:455:34607:21:21:108:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:On the other hand, for instance, we found that ‘one Chinese professor is currently an 
15:456:34692:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:associate  editor  and  ten  professors  from  Hong  Kong  located  universities  are  currently 
15:457:34789:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:editorial board members of the Academy of Management Journal’, which is a highly refereed 
15:458:34879:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and valued academic outlet in the management discipline. While, only one Indian professor is 
15:459:34972:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:currently  an editorial board member of it. Referring to number of published papers in 2014, 
15:460:35064:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:we  found  that  six  papers are affiliated  to  Chinese  universities and  regrettably,  not  even  one 
15:461:35166:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:paper is from  Indian  universities. Furthermore,  one  would certainly notice  that a number  of 
15:462:35261:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Chinese  professors  representing international journals  (e.g.  editor,  associate  editor,  board 
15:463:35359:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:member) are considerably higher  than  that  of  Indian  professors representing. All  in  all, 
15:464:35451:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Chinese   universities   are   being   outperforming   Indian   universities,   especially   in   citable 
15:465:35557:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:documents,  number  of  citations,  international  collaboration  (e.g., Xi'an  Jiaotong-Liverpool 
15:466:35655:21:20:72:525:344:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:University, China Europe International Business School), collaborative research projects and 
15:467:35748:20:21:72:217:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publications and editorship.

15:469:35779:21:20:72:312:282:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:4.4 Abstracting and indexing of Indian journals 
15:470:35825:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Lastly, we purposively uncover a few interesting observations with regard to the management 
15:471:35917:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:discipline. For  example,  Indian  universities  and  institutes  publish  a  number  of  academic 
15:472:36016:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:journals but they are mostly local with no abstracting and indexing in Scopus and SSCI (see 
15:473:36105:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Appendix-II).  Over  the  last  few  years, a  number  of local management  institutes have  taken 
15:474:36204:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:advantage  of  the ‘worldwide distribution at low cost pricing’ with Sage  India  publications 
15:475:36298:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:and thereby started new journals and preferred hosting services, for instance, Global Business 
15:476:36391:21:20:72:523:137:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Review, Journal of Emerging Market Finance, Vision, Management and Labor Studies, Asia-
15:477:36478:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Pacific  Journal  of  Management  Research  and  Innovation, and Vikalpa,  just  to  name  a  few. 
15:478:36577:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:Likewise,  Elsevier  publishes IIMB  Management  Review and Springer  publishes Global 
15:479:36663:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Journal  of  Flexible  Systems  Management, and Decision based  on  pricing  and  distribution 
16:480:36758:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:agreement. Emerald  publishes Journal  of  Indian  Business  Research, Indian  Growth  and 
16:481:36849:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Development  Review and Journal  of  Advances  in  Management Research,  and Taylor  & 
16:482:36935:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Francis   publishes Macroeconomics   and   Finance   in   Emerging   Market   Economies. 
16:483:37024:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:InderScience  publishes International  Journal  of  Indian  Culture  and  Business but it  is not 
16:484:37120:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:affiliated to any resident Indian university. While, many local journals are not even abstracted 
16:485:37216:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:in Cabell’s directory of academic journals,  lacking  quality  in  all  respects  include  research 
16:486:37316:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:output,  formatting  and  finishing. Importantly,  none  of  the  Indian  journal in  management 
16:487:37411:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:subject is indexed in SSCI for Impact Factor, which is the best indicator of publishing quality 
16:488:37507:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:research. In fact, many journals are not accepted for inclusion in the Association of Business 
16:489:37600:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Schools-UK journal  guide and Australian Business Dean’s Council journal ranking list. 
16:490:37685:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Undertaking these journal-publishing  matters  as  a  serious issue, we therefore suggest  that 
16:491:37778:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government  has  to  rethink  and  promote  more  research  activities  for  betterment  of  quality  in 
16:492:37883:21:21:72:299:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research publications and number of citations.  
16:493:37928:21:20:108:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Conversely,  a number  of  quality journals are edited  by  Chinese  universities (or, 
16:494:38014:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:dedicated  to),  for  instance, Management  and  Organization  Review, Asia  Pacific  Journal  of 
16:495:38111:21:21:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Management, China  Economic  Review, Chinese  Management  Studies, Asia  Pacific  Journal 
16:496:38201:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel  & Tourism Marketing, etc. Likewise, South African 
16:497:38290:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:institutes have a  few dedicated  journals  like African Development  Review, South  African 
16:498:38380:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Journal  of Economics, Review  of  Development  Finance, Africa  Journal  of  Management, 
16:499:38470:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Journal  of  Africa  Business, African Journal  of  Economic  and  Management  Studies, etc. 
16:500:38561:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Further, number  of special  issues  with  international  journals  edited  by  resident  Indian 
16:501:38657:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:academicians are not even reached double digit. This figure is really small compare to China 
16:502:38749:21:21:72:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  Latin  American  academicians. We thus strongly propose  that a  number  of  Indian 
16:503:38836:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:institutes  require effective training  in matters  like publishing  high-impact  research,  new 
16:504:38932:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:journal  development,  book  writing,  organizing  conferences  and  workshops,  etc. In  effect, 
16:505:39030:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:they  could  benefit from  the  experiences  of neighboring countries like  China,  Singapore  and 
16:506:39128:21:20:72:107:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Korea. 
16:507:39134:20:21:72:75:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
16:508:39134:21:21:72:284:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:5. University rankings: You deserve this! 
16:509:39175:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The concept of university rankings was originally evolved in the western world, and thereby 
16:510:39267:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:transformed    to    the    emerging    markets    due    to    globalization,    privatization and 
16:511:39366:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:internationalization   of   higher   education   and   research   practices.   Ranking   a   university 
16:512:39470:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:establishes  best  benchmarking  practices  in  the  higher  education  system  and  allows  policy 
16:513:39570:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:makers  in  various  administration  and  development  activities.  In  fact,  a  number  of  best 
17:514:39671:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:practices become standardize for evaluating the current practices and improving the outdated 
17:515:39764:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(rule-based) systems. A number of researchers and independent organizations have developed 
17:516:39853:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:various measures  in  order  to  evaluate  and  rank  the  university based  on  survey, academic 
17:517:39949:21:20:72:525:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:records and actual performance (Gruber, 2014). For example, number of admissions, number 
17:518:40037:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of international students, library and resource budgeting and usefulness, use of ICT, industry 
17:519:40132:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:linkage  and  financial  support,  university  budget,  job  market  and  placement,  high-impact 
17:520:40230:21:20:72:525:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:academic  research  including  number  of  Nobel prize  nominees  and  recipients,  number  of 
17:521:40324:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:citations  for  published  research,  and  international  outlook,  among  others.  We  come  across 
17:522:40425:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:three  most widely  used university  rankings such  as Times  Higher  Education  (THE) World 
17:523:40516:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:University  Rankings, QS World University  Rankings and Academic  Ranking  of  World 
17:524:40599:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Universities (known  as Shanghai  Ranking,  China).  In  a  subject  category, Financial  Times 
17:525:40693:20:21:72:302:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:often publishes Top 100 Best Business Schools. 
17:526:40739:21:21:108:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:We notice that  Indian  universities  were  really  performing  “poorly”  over  their 
17:527:40824:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:neighboring country-based universities from China, Korea and Japan. For example, In case of 
17:528:40916:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:THE-World University Rankings for 2014-15 top 500 list, only four Indian universities were 
17:529:41007:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:ranked, namely Panjab University, Indian Institute of Science-Bangalore (276-300 grouping), 
17:530:41097:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and IIT Bombay, IIT Roorkee (351-400 grouping). The report also indicated that none of the 
17:531:41185:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Indian  university  was  able  to  get  ranking  in  top  200  list  while  there  were  three  Chinese 
17:532:41289:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  and  two  Singaporean  universities (Live  mint,  2014).  Overall,  US  universities 
17:533:41387:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:continue to get top ranking in the list in which it was marked seven universities in top 10 and 
17:534:41483:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:74 in top 200, followed by UK 28, and Germany 12, just to cite a few. Notably, University of 
17:535:41576:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Tokyo (23rd) was ranked  as  the  best  institution  in  Asia. Furthermore,  only  10  Indian 
17:536:41668:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  were  ranked  in  THE-Asia  2014-15 top  100  universities  compare  to  18  Chinese 
17:537:41766:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  that  ranked  in  the  list  (excluding Taiwan  and  Hong  Kong).  The list  of Indian 
17:538:41867:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  include Punjab  University 32, IIT  Kharagpur 45, IIT  Kanpur 55, IIT  Delhi 59, 
17:539:41954:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:IIT  Roorkee 59, IIT  Guwahati 74, Jadavpur  University 76, IIT  Madras 76, Aligarh  Muslim 
17:540:42038:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:University 80, and Jawaharlal Nehru University 90. Indeed, one has to notice that the ranking 
17:541:42129:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:agency-THE usually ranks universities based on 13 parameters in four key segments: industry 
17:542:42221:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:income,  teaching-learning  environment,  research contribution and  international  outlook. For 
17:543:42316:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:example, “research influence (30%) is the most influential indicator that assesses the role of 
17:544:42410:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f6:universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas”. On  the  other  hand,  only three business 
17:545:42503:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:schools were ranked in the Financial Times Top 100 Best Business Schools list for 2014, of 
17:546:42591:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:which IIM-Ahmedabad (30), Indian  School  of  Business-Hyderabad (36)  and IIM-Bangalore 
17:547:42677:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:(68).  In  case  of  China,  seven  business  schools  were  ranked  in  the  list, of  which HKUST 
18:548:42778:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Business  School (14), CEIBS (17), University  of  Hong  Kong (29), Peking  University:

18:553:43047:20:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Lastly  but importantly,  this  section  aims  to  uncover  various  challenges  and issues  that 
18:554:43145:21:20:72:525:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:embedded in the Indian higher education. A number of issues include gross enrolment ratio, 
18:555:43236:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university education and technical infrastructure, job market and placement, industry-oriented 
18:556:43331:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  and innovation, quality  and assessment  of practices, financial support, and political 
18:557:43429:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interference. Further, we  also  suggest a  set  of policy  guidelines  for  improvement  of  the 
18:558:43525:21:20:72:281:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:existing practices and governance systems.

18:560:43567:21:21:72:365:510:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:6.1 Challenges in higher education and academic research 
18:561:43623:21:20:72:208:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.1 Gross enrolment ratio 
18:562:43650:20:21:72:525:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Number of students opting admission in the university degree is relatively small compare to 
18:563:43741:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:number  of  students  admitted  in the pre-university  education.  As  such,  Indian  government  is 
18:564:43842:21:20:72:523:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:being aimed to increase gross enrolment of students in higher education from 17.9% in 2012-
18:565:43933:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:13  to  30% by 2020  (Times  of  India,  2014). Hence,  the  current  rate  is worse than  26%  in 
18:566:44029:21:21:72:525:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:China  and  36%  in  Brazil  (British  Council,  2014). There are  strong  reasons  behind  this 
18:567:44125:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dichotomous  experience,  which  include  poor  financial  status  of  students,  lack  of  student 
18:568:44225:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:motivation, no suitable job after completing university degree, a number of fake guidelines in 
18:569:44320:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:admissions criteria, poor quality of examinations and award of degree, and bogus practices in 
18:570:44413:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government universities, university affiliated colleges and private universities (e.g., Mahajan 
18:571:44506:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:et al., 2014). Therefore,  government should establish better control measures and inspection 
18:572:44598:20:21:72:377:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:committees in order to overcome these dichotomous problems.

18:574:44657:21:20:72:404:220:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.2 University education and physical and technical infrastructure 
18:575:44724:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:One has to remember that education at university level is a matured and appreciated degree in 
18:576:44817:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  society.   In  order  to  provide  better  education  at  degree  and  post-graduation  level 
18:577:44916:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities  must furnish sophisticated  infrastructure  such  as  location,  buildings, technically 
18:578:45018:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:equipped classrooms, library with access to database, textbooks and journals, and computers 
18:579:45109:20:21:72:525:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and technology centers. Overall, one must hold sufficient funds, a pool of talented faculty and 
18:580:45205:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:also  aspire  to  do  beyond  the university  system. In  particular,  Indian  universities have never 
18:581:45307:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:named  as world-class institutions  expect  few  corporate  promoted  institutions  such  as Indian 
19:582:45408:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:School of Business, Hyderabad and national importance institutions such as established IITs, 
19:583:45500:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:NITs,  IISc and IIMs.  Unfortunately,  a  number of  state  universities  are  being  found  with 
19:584:45597:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:outdated  computers  and  applications,  old  buildings, poor  classrooms,  very  bad sanitary 
19:585:45691:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:service including drinking water and restrooms, entrenched local culture, outdated textbooks 
19:586:45783:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  resources,  limited  subscription  to  academic  journals  (mostly,  local  journals  with  low 
19:587:45884:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:cost),  lack of  research  culture and  training among  research  scholars,  lack  of  research 
19:588:45977:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:supervision  skills,  and  so  on. In  fact, many  universities  do  not  provide  office  space for 
19:589:46078:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  scholars  in  social  sciences  and  management  disciplines  and scholars often sit  in 
19:590:46176:21:21:72:200:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:library, canteen or hostel.  
19:591:46204:21:21:108:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Taking  forward,  we  have  asked  a  few  research  scholars  who  are  pursuing  Ph.D.  in 
19:592:46297:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:state  universities about  online  subscriptions  to  international  journals.  They  were  not  even 
19:593:46399:20:21:72:525:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:aware the Academy  of  Management  Journal and international publishers  like Emerald, 
19:594:46484:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Elsevier,  Springer,  John  Wiley,  Taylor &Francis,  etc.  However,  they  were recalled a  few 
19:595:46580:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:local  journals  that  are mostly available  in  printed  copies  published  by  Sage  India  and  other 
19:596:46684:20:21:72:525:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publishers,  for  example, Global  Business  Review, Indian  Journal  of  Finance,  just  to  cite  a 
19:597:46786:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:few. Regrettably,  a  number  of  scholars were  not  even  heard  what  is APA referencing  style 
19:598:46883:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:during their doctoral studies. The fact, yet the fate is that untrained scholars join as a faculty 
19:599:46982:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in the same university or in other institutions, then would become supervisors for scholars in 
19:600:47077:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:coming  years.  Albeit,  the  result  is  same,  it  infers  that “why  should  I  do  research  when  my 
19:601:47183:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:supervisor  does  not  know  about  research  and  publications?  So, I  simply  follow her”. 
19:602:47277:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Therefore, government should provide sufficient financial assistance in order to improve the 
19:603:47369:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:quality  in  doctoral  research  and  journal  publications  that  would have  significant  impact  on 
19:604:47472:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the overall performance of the university. At the same time, government should remover bad 
19:605:47562:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:practices that injected but largely mixed in doctoral research admissions, research grants, fake 
19:606:47659:20:21:72:237:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publications and award of degree. 
19:607:47692:21:21:72:75:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
19:608:47692:21:20:72:229:220:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.3 Job market and placement 
19:609:47722:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Job  market  and  placement  has  become  more  challenging task in  higher  education  sector at 
19:610:47820:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:both  universities  and  autonomous  institutions. A number  of  corporate  recruiting  firms argue 
19:611:47918:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:that  university  education  in  India truly fails  to teach appropriate theory  and  provide  better 
19:612:48019:21:20:72:525:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:hands-on-experience  that  require  for  industry.  Conversely,  job  market  is  really  in  a  bad 
19:613:48120:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:situation  wherein  many  international companies were  financially closed around  the  2007-08 
19:614:48214:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:global  financial  crisis.  A  recent  survey  by  NASSCOM  reported  that  only  25%  of  technical 
19:615:48315:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:graduates  and  15%  other  graduates  are  employed  in  information  technology  sector.  Another 
20:616:48417:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:survey  on  management discipline indicated that only  23%  of graduates  are  employed  in 
20:617:48507:21:21:72:449:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:various industries, largely banking and finance sector (Times of India, 2014).  
20:618:48586:21:21:108:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:We also present a few realistic but contradicting observations that come across in our 
20:619:48672:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:experiences. Firstly, a number of applications for Ph.D. admission in universities and national 
20:620:48766:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:importance  institutes have massively  increased  for  last  three  years.  This  is  due  to  rate  of 
20:621:48869:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:increase for unemployment  in  corporate  sector,  growing  number  of  fresh  graduate  holders, 
20:622:48966:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  importantly,  significant  increase  in  monthly  stipend  from  Rs.  16000  to  Rs.  25000  per 
20:623:49068:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:month. Further,  a  Ph.D.  scholar  continues  to  get  stipend  for  minimum  of  three years to 
20:624:49166:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:maximum of five years. While, monthly stipend for a Ph.D. scholar in management discipline 
20:625:49257:21:21:72:525:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:is  considerably three  times higher  than  monthly  salary  for  a junior faculty  member  in 
20:626:49351:21:20:72:525:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university-affiliated  colleges.  Secondly,  an  academic  doctorate that  dedicated five  years  for 
20:627:49451:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Ph.D.  in management  discipline has joined  as  a junior faculty  member  in  a  third-grade 
20:628:49544:21:21:72:525:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:management college for Rs. 14000 per month. Likewise, another doctorate has also joined in 
20:629:49635:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:a pre-university college for Rs. 6500 per month with 12 hrs teaching load per week. Based on 
20:630:49727:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:these facts, one should question whether to continue in the current job or to do another Ph.D.? 
20:631:49822:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Albeit,  we  cannot  treat  them as  dignity  of  labor, in  that  case what  is  the  use  of  doctorate 
20:632:49926:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:degree?  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  on  Indian  university education,  there  are  plenty  of 
20:633:50027:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:dichotomous experiences  yet most  horrible and miserable. A  number  of private  business 
20:634:50116:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:schools in India do consider only teaching experience and not consider research publications. 
20:635:50210:21:21:72:525:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Because,  they mostly act  as  teaching  theatres, recruit  people who  mug  up simply  textbooks 
20:636:50305:21:20:72:257:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and even become placement agencies.

20:639:50386:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Referring  to  the  mounting  competition  among  universities,  a  higher  education  institution 
20:640:50485:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:should   have   an   ability   to   establish   innovation   and   incubation centers for   promoting 
20:641:50586:21:21:72:525:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:entrepreneurship  activities. For  example,  innovation  is  referred  as  “it  lies  in  developing 
20:642:50687:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:products  and  processes  that  successfully  solve  points  of  pain  in  existing  technologies  in  an 
20:643:50793:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:economical, scalable and vastly more efficient manner leading to significant value addition to 
20:644:50888:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  end user” (Times of India, 2014). As  such,  education  at  university  level  must  prepare 
20:645:50986:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:students  and  make  them  engage  more  in  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  programs  that 
20:646:51081:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:should be at  the  forefront, thus  bridges  the  gap  between  academic  degree  and  industry 
20:647:51176:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:requirements. This  initiate,  conversely,  helps to getting  involved  more  in  research  and 
20:648:51271:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:development  labs  at  industry  location  that  usually  brings  some  amount  of  grants,  which  can 
20:649:51375:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:be   used   to promote research culture among   various   disciplines   that   leads   to   more 
21:650:51472:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interdisciplinary  research. Regrettably,  it  is  still  lacking  in  the  Indian  higher  education; and 
21:651:51577:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:many  companies  do  not  consider  grades and percentages  in  their  recruitment  due  to 
21:652:51668:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:competition between public and private universities and lack of required skills in applicants. 
21:653:51763:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Herewith, we argue that not the government but both universities and companies should come 
21:654:51854:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:forward  and  establish  a  few  research centers that  likely  help  students  to  understand  the 
21:655:51953:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:industry  needs  and  requirements.  However,  very  few  institutions  like  IITs  and  IISc  are  now 
21:656:52057:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:promoting more industry-oriented research through better course plan, teaching material and 
21:657:52149:20:21:72:159:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:training modules. 
21:658:52166:21:21:72:75:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
21:659:52166:21:21:72:274:572:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.5 Quality and assessment of practices 
21:660:52207:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:University  education  needs  to  be  defined,  designed,  dedicated, assessed and  improved 
21:661:52299:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:following   the   economic   changes,   increasing   competition   among   public   and   private 
21:662:52397:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities,  and  industry  requirements. Thus,  one  must  adapt  best  practices  not  only  at 
21:663:52497:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:administration   level   but   also   at   teaching   resources,   course   content,   examinations   and 
21:664:52603:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:placement that allows universities and institutions to get more advantage of the markets and 
21:665:52695:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:opportunities  as  well  as  establishes  academic  relations  with  the  industry.  In  case  of  India, 
21:666:52801:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:NAAC  and  NBA  are  two  independent  organizations  that  responsible  to  grade  and  rank  the 
21:667:52900:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities and institutions. Hence, quality measures and assessment practices are not up to 
21:668:52994:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the de  facto subject  and  their  assessment  is  biased,  yet mostly influenced  by  corruption  and 
21:669:53096:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:political  interference.  Further,  calculating the scores  for  journal  publications,  conference 
21:670:53196:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:presentations,  workshops  and  book  publications  are  not  convinced  to  many  academicians, 
21:671:53293:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f9:especially talented academic researchers. For example, presenting a paper in the Academy of 
21:672:53385:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:Management  Annual  Meetings and unknown  international  conference  carries  equal  scores. 
21:673:53476:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Likewise,  publishing  a  research  paper  in the SSCI-indexed  journal and unknown  (not  even 
21:674:53571:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:indexed  in  Scopus)  journal  carries  equal  weights.  Therefore,  Indian  university  system  really 
21:675:53675:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:needs  progressive  changes  in  the   governance  systems,  quality  measures  and  research 
21:676:53769:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assessment as   to place   in   global   university   rankings.   Being   stated   that, one   should 
21:677:53869:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:accountable  to  the  government  and society. Taking  forward,  government  should  establish  a 
21:678:53965:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research assessment council to eliminate scientific fraud activities such as submission of fake 
21:679:54060:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:thesis  reports,  plagiarized  research  proposals  and  bogus  academic  journals  (publish  only  for 
21:680:54164:21:20:72:525:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:fee). As  such,  a  number  of  policy initiatives  surely  help  the  universities  and  institutions  in 
21:681:54270:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assessing  the  performance  of  a  faculty,  research  scholar  and  department  for  various  reasons 
21:682:54374:21:21:72:430:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:include appointment, promotions and incentives for high-impact research. 
21:683:54445:21:0:72:75:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
22:684:54447:0:21:72:188:759:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.6 Financial support 
22:685:54470:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:University  education requires huge budget  and needs unremitting financial support from the 
22:686:54562:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government. However, one has to manage not only fundraising but also budget allocation and 
22:687:54653:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:control the misuse of such  funds.  In  the  early  years  after  independence,  government had 
22:688:54747:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:mostly allocated  budget  for  setting  up  national  importance  institutes,  central  and  state 
22:689:54846:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities and specialized institutions in underdeveloped locations. For some reason, Indian 
22:690:54941:21:20:72:525:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:universities are known  about  the  world  university  rankings  though they did  not really  try to 
22:691:55040:20:21:72:525:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:get into such top rewards due to lack of – funds, expertise in writing and publishing research, 
22:692:55135:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university   interest,   talented   academicians,   in-house   politics   and   power, quality   and 
22:693:55235:21:21:72:525:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:assessment  practices. Unfortunately,  policy  makers  also  design  unproductive  schemes,  then 
22:694:55332:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government approves  budget to  such  projects  for  no  productive  benefits.  For  example, 
22:695:55425:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:postdoctoral  fellowships  to “unemployed”  women doctorates, why  should  government 
22:696:55509:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:encourage unemployed women, if what is right with unemployed women and granting funds 
22:697:55592:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:for postdoctoral research on part time basis?  In such cases,  government should enquire how 
22:698:55685:20:21:72:525:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:many applicants are  genuine  and  why  are they unemployed after  holding  doctorate  degree. 
22:699:55778:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:One  should  also assess how  many  papers they  are publishing  in  SCI-indexed  journals  and 
22:700:55872:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:what their contribution to the respective field is. We strongly argue that these concerns bring 
22:701:55967:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:lot  of  policy  changes  in  the  higher education  system,  which  would have  positive  impact  on 
22:702:56068:21:21:72:292:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:overall performance of the university system. 
22:703:56113:21:21:72:75:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
22:704:56113:21:20:72:204:344:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.1.7 Political interference 
22:705:56141:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:It  is  also  a  fact  that  the  university  education  frequently  litigates  and  influences  by  political 
22:706:56252:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:environment in emerging countries like India and China. In a recent study, Xie et al. (2014) 
22:707:56342:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:mentioned that China has been facing number difficulties due to political issues and scientific 
22:708:56438:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:fraud. Being  stated  that, level  of  political intervention is  too  severe  in  overall  Indian 
22:709:56534:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:education  system (Business  Standard,  2014;  New  Indian  Express,  2015).  Because,  most  of 
22:710:56630:21:20:72:523:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:the  politicians  hold  deep  cash  flows  and  have  political  power  to  set  up a school,  pre-
22:711:56729:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university  college,  engineering  institute and private  university.  In  fact,  appointment  of  vice 
22:712:56832:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:chancellor  in  a  state  university  is mostly influenced  by  ruling  political  party  include  chief 
22:713:56936:21:21:72:525:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:minister and concerned minister. Likewise, faculty recruitment in a local affiliated college or 
22:714:57032:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:autonomous  college  is greatly hooked  by  local  ministers  and  influential  persons. It will  be 
22:715:57130:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:even more when the faculty recruitment happens at a state or central university. For instance, 
22:716:57223:21:21:72:525:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:a private university  has sold  faculty  appointments for  direct  cash due  to  local  political 
22:717:57320:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:influence and of course, same caste, community, religion, or location. Therefore, government 
23:718:57414:0:21:72:525:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:should either  control  such  wrong  practices or  privatize  the  higher  education  and  encourage 
23:719:57515:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:international  university  collaboration. One should  also  remember  that  a  complete  control  of 
23:720:57615:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:political intervention may not possible for government but the level of such involvement can 
23:721:57708:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:be controlled  by  imposing  strict  guidelines  and  severe  penalties. Furthermore,  many  issues 
23:722:57807:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(e.g., reservation system, fee reimbursement for political benefit) are unresolved with regard 
23:723:57901:21:21:72:360:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to higher education and job market (Basant and Sen, 2014).

23:725:57959:21:20:72:187:613:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:6.2 Policy implications 
23:726:57982:20:21:72:186:593:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.2.1 Research funding 
23:727:58004:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Research  funding  is  the  most  important  element  in  higher  education  and  high  impact 
23:728:58099:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research. Indeed, a university that has financial support, sophisticated physical and technical 
23:729:58195:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infrastructure,  pool  of  talented  academic  faculty,  high-impact  research  and quality  of 
23:730:58291:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:admissions  not  only  influence  university  recognition  and  brand  name  but  also  influence 
23:731:58389:21:20:72:525:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:industry  income  and  number  of  citations (e.g.,  Jowkar et  al., 2011).  All  in  all,  will  have 
23:732:58490:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:significant  impact  on  university  rankings. Therefore,  emerging  countries  like  India must 
23:733:58586:21:21:72:525:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:allocate more funds to university-level research and training centers for encouraging students 
23:734:58680:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to pursue research degree as well as to bridge the gap between academic courses and industry 
23:735:58773:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:requirements. For example, the ratio of China’s R&D expenditure to that of the United States 
23:736:58866:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:has appreciably increased to 44% in 2010 from 5% in 1991 (Xie et al., 2014). On one hand, 
23:737:58954:21:21:72:525:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government  may approach cash-rich local companies  to  fund  and  manage  state  universities 
23:738:59048:21:20:72:525:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:for  various  reasons  include  physical  infrastructure,  network  building and  placement.  This 
23:739:59147:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:seems to be more appropriate scheme when compare to the scheme that allows corporates to 
23:740:59236:21:21:72:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:start  their  own  university. For  instance,  company  representatives can  participate  in  strategic 
23:741:59339:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:decisions,  faculty  recruitment,  course  content,  research  training  and  placements. As  such, 
23:742:59438:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:similar  kind  of  schemes can  be  designed  for  international  universities  who  are  keen  to  offer 
23:743:59544:21:21:72:166:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:programs in India.  
23:744:59563:21:20:108:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:On  the  other  hand,  government  should  think  genuinely  what  the  purpose  of  research 
23:745:59657:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:fellowship is. It simply refers to that government supports research scholars “financially” for 
23:746:59753:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:learning and conducting productive research during the course period. Assume that, a scholar 
23:747:59846:21:21:72:525:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:has  completed  her  doctorate  in  four  years  wherein she received  the  fellowship  (monthly 
23:748:59943:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:stipend and annual contingency grant) for full duration. After, she joined as a faculty member 
23:749:60038:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in a private university for government scale. The point what we are trying to highlight is that 
23:750:60133:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:did she pay back that research fellowship? It is obliviously ‘no’, then how should government 
23:751:60223:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:support  new  doctoral  admissions  in  coming  years.  If  not,  there  will  be  always  deficit  in 
24:752:60328:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government budget  that  require  for new doctoral  admissions  and  high  impact  research. To 
24:753:60422:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:overcome  the  budget  deficit  as  well  as  encourage  doctoral  research  admissions,  government 
24:754:60523:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:should  ask  previous  stipendiary  candidates  to  pay  that  fellowship  amount back  to the 
24:755:60618:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:government research fund in equivalent future years. It will not be a serious financial burden 
24:756:60711:20:21:72:525:676:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:if government implements “paying-back  fellowship  scheme” after two years from the award 
24:757:60801:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:year. In  fact,  government  can  include  this proposal as  a  criterion in  faculty  recruitment  in 
24:758:60902:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:state  and  central  universities. The noteworthy intentions  behind  this  scheme  are  to  create 
24:759:61000:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:serious research interest among research scholars and supervisors and to support the national 
24:760:61094:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:development. Though,  teaching  assistant (not,  project  assistant)  during  Ph.D.  program  is 
24:761:61190:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:biased yet largely bogus in all most all universities. This scheme can be extended to M.Tech, 
24:762:61282:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:MSc  and other  fellowship  master  degrees. As  such,  UGC  must  establish  an  independent 
24:763:61376:20:21:72:382:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research assessment cell as to minor and administer the scheme. 
24:764:61439:21:21:72:75:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
24:765:61439:21:20:72:255:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.2.2 Collaborative research projects 
24:766:61476:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Zoogah et al. (2015) described that institutional environment, resources, level of involvement 
24:767:61570:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:by  universities,  institutions  and  individuals  are  major  drives  of  high-impact  research. We 
24:768:61670:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:therefore   emphasize   that   level   of   involvement   is   the   most   critical   success   factor   in 
24:769:61779:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:collaborative research projects. Further, level of involvement should be high when a foreign 
24:770:61872:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university  associated  with developed  market  shows  keen interest in  such  collaborative 
24:771:61963:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  projects. These  schemes  are  special  purpose  instruments  wherein universities  have 
24:772:62060:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:advantage   over   direct   participation,   research   output,   research   grants   and   research 
24:773:62161:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publications.  For  example,  a  state  university  has  signed  a  collaborative  research  agreement 
24:774:62264:21:21:72:525:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:with a well-known UK university. Firstly, there  will be an exchange of ideas among faculty 
24:775:62356:21:20:72:526:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:members  who  involve  in  it.  This  allows  local  faculty  to  share  their  own  thoughts  and 
24:776:62455:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:experiences as  well  as  to  work  with  skilled academic researchers. Secondly, research  grant 
24:777:62552:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:can  be  shared  among  participant  universities  and  eventually  the  research  output  can  be 
24:778:62651:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:disseminated  by  publishing in  journals  and  books  that  will certainly  bring  new  citations. 
24:779:62748:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Lastly,  local  faculty members who  participated  in  such  collaborative  research  projects  may 
24:780:62848:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:give training to their colleagues and doctoral students for betterment in research projects and 
24:781:62944:21:21:72:526:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publications. Thus,  universities can  establish international  collaboration  not  only  in  projects 
24:782:63045:21:20:72:525:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:handling  but  also  in  course  development,  teaching  methods,  quality  assessment  process, 
24:783:63142:20:21:72:386:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:infrastructure development, and faculty recruitment and training. 
24:784:63206:21:21:72:75:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
24:785:63206:21:0:72:75:75:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9: 
25:786:63208:0:21:72:241:759:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:6.2.3 Research assessment council 
25:787:63241:21:21:72:526:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Our  view  is  that  research  assessment  council  should  accomplish  three  main  goals,  namely 
25:788:63341:21:21:72:525:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:evaluating research  papers  and  books  published  by  faculty  and  research  scholars  in  a 
25:789:63436:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:university, auditing the income  received  from  industry-oriented  research,  and  ranking  best 
25:790:63534:20:21:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:papers, best professors, best local journals and best universities in India. The council must be 
25:791:63628:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:an  independent organization established  under  MHRD  and  UGC.  Government  can  recruit 
25:792:63718:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:senior  researchers  and  provide  training  on  various  assessment  measures  at  international 
25:793:63816:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:standards. Further, the council is also responsible for establishing a research assessment cell 
25:794:63912:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:in  all  public  and  private  universities  and  autonomous  institutions.  Importantly, senior 
25:795:64009:21:21:72:526:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:professors  and  government  officials  must  guide  the  council on  serious  issues  such  as 
25:796:64105:21:20:72:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:scientific fraud, fake journal publications, bogus Ph.D. theses and certificates, duplication in 
25:797:64202:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  output  and  approval  of  patents,  among  others. Being  stated  that, the council is 
25:798:64297:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:accountable  to  communicate the university  assessment  report  for various  purposes  include 
25:799:64392:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:NAAC,  NBA  and overall  university  rankings. The council  can  award  incentives  for  best 
25:800:64484:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research  publications  published  by  faculty  members,  retired  academicians  and  researchers, 
25:801:64583:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students. Hence, incentives for high-impact research should 
25:802:64677:21:20:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:restrict  to authors  who  are  affiliated  with  Indian  universities and  institutes.  Conversely, the 
25:803:64782:20:21:72:525:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:council can coordinate with global ranking assessment councils and multinational publishing 
25:804:64874:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:companies to provide better training for universities, faculties and students in matters include 
25:805:64971:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:publishing research, journal development and research metrics. In addition, it is accountable 
25:806:65063:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:to provide  Indian  Researcher  ID  and conduct  awareness  workshops  on the open  access 
25:807:65154:20:21:72:348:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:repository services like Shodhganga and ShodhGangotri.

25:809:65208:21:20:72:149:282:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:7. Conclusions 
25:810:65222:20:21:72:526:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:The aim of this paper was to present the current state of higher education system, high-impact 
25:811:65316:21:21:72:526:241:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research and university rankings in Asian emerging market-India. To do so, we collected data 
25:812:65409:21:20:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:from archival sources and thereby accomplished our goals based on inductive and deductive 
25:813:65498:20:21:72:526:200:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:logics. Firstly, overview of higher education and government schemes for academic research 
25:814:65586:21:21:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:was  discussed.  Secondly,  progress  of  high-impact  research  in  India  and  China  for  three 
25:815:65685:21:21:72:525:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:categories  (all  subjects,  BMA  and  EEF)  was  assessed  and  commented. Further,  abstracting 
25:816:65783:21:20:72:526:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:and  indexing  of  Indian  and  Chinese  journals  was  compared.  Thirdly,  we  described  potential 
25:817:65885:20:21:72:526:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:challenges  in  the  Indian  university  education  and  thereby  recommended  fruitful  policy 
25:818:65981:21:21:72:526:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:guidelines  for  betterment  of  the  existing  practices  and  university  rankings. In  particular,  we 
25:819:66086:21:0:72:526:75:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:reported country-based research metrics for citable documents, number of citations, cites per 
26:820:66182:0:21:72:526:759:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:document and H-index in all three categories. For citable documents in all subjects category, 
26:821:66275:21:21:72:525:738:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:United States was ranked 1st, followed by China 2nd, United Kingdom 3rd ..., and India 9th. 
26:822:66367:21:21:72:526:717:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Overall, Chinese universities are found to be outperforming Indian universities, especially in 
26:823:66462:21:20:72:526:696:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:citable  documents,  number  of  citations,  international  collaboration,  collaborative  research 
26:824:66562:20:21:72:523:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:projects,  publications  and  editorship,  and  university  rankings. We  also  suggested  that  high-
26:825:66663:21:21:72:526:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:impact  research  influences  by  three  important  factors,  namely  individual-,  university- and 
26:826:66762:21:20:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:country-specific  factors. Importantly,  we  also  proposed  that  a  number  of  Indian  universities 
26:827:66864:20:21:72:526:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:really  require  effective  training  in  academic  and  administration  matters  such  as  publishing 
26:828:66967:21:21:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:high-impact  research,  new  journal  development,  book  writing,  organizing  conferences  and 
26:829:67064:21:21:72:153:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:workshops, etc.  
26:830:67080:21:20:108:526:551:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Furthermore,  a number of potential challenges were deeply discussed, which include 
26:831:67164:20:21:72:526:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:gross  enrolment  ratio,  university  education  and  physical  and  technical  infrastructure,  job 
26:832:67265:21:21:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:market  and  placement,  industry-oriented  research  and  innovation,  quality  and  assessment  of 
26:833:67366:21:20:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:practices, financial  support,  and  political  interference.  Then,  a  set  of  policy  guidelines 
26:834:67466:20:21:72:526:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:(research  funding,  collaborative  research  projects  and  research  assessment  council)  was 
26:835:67563:21:21:72:526:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:suggested for imparting quality academic practices and standards. For example, we proposed 
26:836:67654:21:20:72:525:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:that  government  should embark ‘paying-back fellowship scheme’ to create serious research 
26:837:67745:20:21:72:526:407:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:interest  among  public  and  private  universities  and  to  support  the  national  development. 
26:838:67844:21:21:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:Eventually, findings of the paper would influence university teaching, industry collaboration, 
26:839:67939:21:21:72:526:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:high-impact  research,  global  university  rankings  and  national  progress. Yet,  the  study  was 
26:840:68039:21:20:72:526:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:restricted to India and not used survey or interview data to explore the realistic performance 
26:841:68134:20:21:72:526:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:of  higher  education  and  research.  Hence,  conducting  a  survey  among  higher  education 
26:842:68229:21:21:72:526:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:institutes,  and  government  and  non-government  universities  with  regard  to  academics  and 
26:843:68327:21:20:72:361:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:research assessment measures deserves future research.
