2:25:1144:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:This paper studies the dynamics of international trade flows at business cycle frequencies. We show
2:26:1243:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:that introducing dynamic considerations into an otherwise standard model of trade can account for
2:27:1340:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:several puzzling features of trade flows at business cycle frequencies. Our insight is that because international
2:28:1453:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:trade is time-intensive, variation in the rate at which agents are willing to substitute across time affects
2:29:1561:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:how trade volumes respond to changes in output and prices. We formalize this idea and calibrate our
2:30:1660:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:model to match key features of U.S. data. We find that, in contrast to standard static models of international
2:31:1770:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:trade, our model is quantitatively consistent with salient features of U.S. cyclical import fluctuations.
2:32:1875:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:A:We also find that our model accounts for two-thirds of the peak-to-trough decline in imports during
2:33:1974:14:42:72:192:476:12:Times:12:Times:A:the 2008-2009 recession.

3:48:2295:0:28:56:157:719:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1. Introduction
3:49:2310:28:18:57:555:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The collapse of international trade during the recent financial crisis exposed the failure of stan-
3:50:2409:18:18:56:554:673:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dard trade models to explain the response of trade volumes to changes in economic activity
3:51:2499:18:18:56:554:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:during both normal and crisis episodes.1For instance, the empirical elasticity of imports to
3:52:2591:18:18:56:555:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures of economic output are well above one, yet standard models have a unitary income
3:53:2680:18:18:56:555:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity. Similarly, while the empirical elasticity of import volumes to measures of relative
3:54:2775:18:18:56:555:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices is well below one, typical calibrations of standard models use values that are well above
3:55:2871:18:18:56:555:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one. Moreover, accounting exercises that use static trade models to measure deviations between
3:56:2965:18:24:56:518:565:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:predicted and observed fluctuations in imports find these deviations to be pro-cyclical.2
3:57:3054:24:18:57:555:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper, we show that introducing dynamic considerations into a standard model of trade
3:58:3147:18:18:56:554:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can account for these puzzling features. The dynamic consideration we focus on is a time-to-
3:59:3239:18:18:56:554:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ship friction to import goods and its interaction with a finite intertemporal elasticity of substitu-
3:60:3340:18:18:56:554:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion.3The time-to-ship friction makes the importing decision dynamic because resources today
3:61:3432:18:18:56:554:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must be sacrificed for the delivery of goods tomorrow. With a finite intertemporal elasticity
3:62:3525:18:17:56:554:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of substitution, the rate at which agents are willing to substitute across time—the intertempo-
3:63:3620:17:18:56:555:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ral marginal rate of substitution—depends on the trade-off between consumption today ver-
3:64:3709:18:18:56:554:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sus expectations of consumption tomorrow. Our insight is that variation in the intertemporal
3:65:3801:18:18:56:555:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal rate of substitution with changes in income and relative prices breaks the unitary in-
3:66:3896:18:18:56:555:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:come elasticity, biases the estimated price elasticity relative to static trade models, and shows
3:67:3993:18:18:56:554:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:up as a time-varying trade friction. Quantitatively, we show that this insight is able to account
3:68:4090:18:25:56:382:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well for these key features of U.S. cyclical import fluctuations.
3:69:4155:25:17:57:554:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We formalize these ideas by building a pure exchange, Armington model of trade. An agent
3:70:4243:17:18:56:555:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:within a country receives a stochastic endowment of its own nationally differentiated good.
3:71:4334:18:18:56:555:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Agents have time-separable preferences of the constant relative risk aversion class over an ag-
3:72:4429:18:18:56:555:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gregate consumption good. The aggregate consumption good is a composite of the nationally
3:73:4518:18:18:56:554:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differentiated goods, and the aggregator of the goods is of the constant elasticity of substitution
3:74:4617:18:18:56:554:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:class. Agents take prices as given, and we model the evolution of relative prices as follow-
3:75:4709:18:18:56:555:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing a stochastic process. International purchases are subject to an ad-valorem trade cost. The
3:76:4803:18:18:56:555:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only other friction that agents face is that they must commit resources today for the delivery of
3:77:4900:18:19:56:263:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imported goods in subsequent periods.
3:78:4937:19:16:70:558:157:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:1Examples of models of this type are those ofKrugman(1980), Eaton and Kortum(2002), Anderson and van
3:79:5037:16:12:56:555:141:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Wincoop(2003), andMelitz(2003). This also includes international real business-cycle models as summarized in
3:80:5145:12:8:56:215:129:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland(1995).
3:81:5178:8:15:70:555:121:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:2Houthakker and Magee(1969) is the seminal reference that documents the high income elasticity for the U.S.
3:82:5285:15:12:56:555:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:and other countries at low frequencies.Jacks, Meissner, and Novy(2009) andLevchenko, Lewis, and Tesar(2010a),
3:83:5394:12:12:56:555:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:building on the insights ofChari, Kehoe, and McGrattan(2007) emphasize the third fact’s role in accounting for
3:84:5504:12:9:56:280:82:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:the decline in trade during the 2008-2010 recession.
3:85:5556:9:15:70:555:73:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:3Hummels and Schaur(2013) document the time intensive nature of international trade and, thus, introducing
3:86:5662:15:0:56:439:58:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:a time-to-ship friction is a natural way to introduce dynamics to the decision to import.
4:87:5752:0:18:57:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We use the model to answer the following quantitative question: Given a stochastic process
4:88:5842:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:describing income and prices as in U.S. data, how do the time-to-ship friction and finite in-
4:89:5935:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tertemporal elasticity of substitution shape the decision to import? To answer this question, we
4:90:6031:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate the stochastic process for endowments and prices from U.S. data. We then feed this
4:91:6122:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stochastic process into our model and walk through several exercises to study the quantitative
4:92:6216:18:24:56:271:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importance of our proposed mechanism.
4:93:6253:24:18:57:554:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The first exercise studies the model implied income and price elasticities. To compute these
4:94:6345:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures, we simulate the model and estimate the model implied income and price elasticities
4:95:6437:18:18:56:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using simulated data under different assumptions about the intertemporal elasticity of substi-
4:96:6531:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tution, the elasticity of substitution across goods, and the shipping technology. We find that
4:97:6625:18:18:56:555:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model can quantitatively account for the high income elasticity and low price elasticity ob-
4:98:6721:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:served in U.S. time series data. For instance, with an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of
4:99:6819:18:18:56:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.20 and an elasticity of substitution of 1.5, the income and price elasticities are 1.70 and -0.34;
4:100:6919:18:18:56:554:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the data, they are 1.99 and -0.26. Performing the same exercise, but removing the time-to-
4:101:7012:18:18:56:555:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ship friction or shutting down variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, we
4:102:7107:18:17:56:555:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find the estimated income elasticity is effectively one and the price elasticity is the same as our
4:103:7206:17:25:56:241:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:calibrated elasticity of substitution.
4:104:7244:25:18:57:554:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The second exercise focuses on the ability of our model to account for the observed dynamics
4:105:7336:18:18:56:555:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of U.S. imports. To discipline this exercise, we calibrate the preference parameters of our model
4:106:7433:18:18:56:555:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to match features of the data over the first half of our sample. We then compute our model’s
4:107:7525:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predicted import series for the the un-targeted second half of our sample and compare it with
4:108:7618:18:18:56:555:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data. We find that our model accounts well for the dynamics in U.S. imports by correctly cap-
4:109:7711:18:17:56:571:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:turing the overall magnitude and timing of cyclical fluctuations (see Figure5(a)   .) And that the
4:110:7809:17:25:56:554:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:active intertemporal marginal rate of substitution is critical to accounting for these fluctuations.
4:111:7909:25:18:57:554:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we provide supporting evidence of the mechanism by examining some cross-sectional
4:112:7999:18:18:56:554:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implications of our model. In particular, our model predicts that a country’s bilateral imports
4:113:8094:18:18:56:555:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:should be more volatile when sourced from a partner with longer shipping times. This impli-
4:114:8185:18:18:56:555:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cation is a test of our model because static trade models (or our dynamic model with no active
4:115:8279:18:17:56:555:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intertemporal marginal rate of substitution) predict that the volatility of imports is independent
4:116:8377:17:18:56:555:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of to the time-to-ship/distance. Using data constructed byHummels and Schaur(2013) and the
4:117:8467:18:18:56:555:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:World Bank on shipping times, we find that US imports from countries with higher than aver-
4:118:8558:18:18:56:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:age shipping times are considerably more volatile than imports from countries with lower than
4:119:8651:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average shipping times. We find these results to be supportive of the underlying mechanism at
4:120:8744:18:25:56:87:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work.
4:121:8749:25:19:57:555:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our results have much to say about the large drop in trade during the 2008-2009 crisis.4Our
4:122:8840:19:0:70:559:68:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:4Much attention has focused on this episode. See, for example, the papers inBaldwin(2010); Alessandria,
5:123:8944:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explanation is simple: a very large shock unexpectedly reduced output, and agents became
5:124:9032:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unwilling to substitute (on the margin) across time periods. Because international trade is time-
5:125:9129:18:18:56:554:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intensive, imports declined more than absorption resulting in a trade collapse. Quantitatively,
5:126:9224:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we find that our model accounts two-thirds of the peak-to-trough decline in imports in U.S.
5:127:9315:18:24:56:539:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports (see Figure6), when the parameters of the model are calibrated to pre-crisis events.
5:128:9407:24:18:57:554:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our results complement alternative mechanisms proposed to explain the trade collapse. In
5:129:9495:18:18:56:554:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particular, an active intertemporal marginal rate of substitution would surely amplify the role
5:130:9590:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of financial fictions discussed inAmiti and Weinstein(2011) andChor and Manova(2012),
5:131:9675:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inventory considerations inAlessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2010b), or the future value of
5:132:9767:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufactures as inEaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis(2013). The distinguishing feature of
5:133:9856:18:18:56:555:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our story, however, is that it does not rely on specifics about the 2008-2009 crisis but applies
5:134:9952:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:broadly across time periods. This is a key implication of our second exercise which calibrated
5:135:10046:18:18:56:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model parameters to pre-crisis events. Moreover, the lack of reliance on specifics of 2008-
5:136:10141:18:18:56:555:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2009 crisis is consistent with the evidence fromStock and Watson(2012) who find that the same
5:137:10234:18:24:56:526:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factors that explained previous postwar recessions also explain the most recent recession.
5:138:10324:24:18:57:554:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Trade elasticities play critical roles in formulating predictions and recommendations for policy
5:139:10420:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makers with regard to issues such as the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and policy (see,
5:140:10515:18:18:56:555:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:e.g.,Houthakker and Magee(1969) andMarquez(2002) for a discussion of this research). The
5:141:10603:18:18:56:555:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:key questions surrounding the empirical estimates of trade elasticities concern their stability
5:142:10698:18:18:56:554:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(and, hence, their usefulness in making predictions) and the disconnect with the predictions
5:143:10790:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of standard trade models. We contribute to this literature by providing answers to these open
5:144:10883:18:18:56:555:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:questions. First, we rationalize the disconnect between empirical trade elasticities and standard
5:145:10980:18:17:56:555:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade models by introducing dynamics into the import decision. Moreover, while our model
5:146:11068:17:18:56:555:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not have constant price and income elasticities, it retains the parsimony and performance
5:147:11162:18:18:56:555:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of statistical models. These two features—theoretical consistency and statistical performance—
5:148:11256:18:42:56:555:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that our model can contribute to answering important forecasting and policy questions.
5:149:11350:42:28:56:393:220:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2. Cyclical Features of International Trade Volumes
5:150:11401:28:18:57:555:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we document some key features of the cyclicalfluctuations of imports, income,
5:151:11495:18:18:56:555:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices and their co-movement in U.S. time series data. The data features we describe are not
5:152:11587:18:18:56:554:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:new; for example seeHouthakker and Magee(1969) on the income elasticity of trade at long-

5:155:11854:18:22:56:555:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three features of the data is important since we will later show that they can be simultaneously

6:160:12216:24:18:57:555:699:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Before proceeding, it is worthwhile to outline our language conventions. First, while we use
6:161:12308:18:18:56:555:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the term “elasticity,” the estimates we discuss are best thought of as simply summarizing the
6:162:12401:18:18:56:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:statistical properties of how imports, income, and prices behave in the time series. Second,
6:163:12493:18:18:56:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:although the measure of economic activity that we focus on is absorption, we use the terms
6:164:12583:18:25:56:374:627:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:income, output, and absorption synonymously throughout.5
6:165:12639:25:18:57:555:602:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To summarize the statistical properties of imports, income,and prices in U.S. time series data,
6:166:12734:18:17:56:555:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we use a log-linear relationship relating imports to prices and income. The rationale for using
6:167:12829:17:18:56:555:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this relationship comes from standard models of international trade based on CES preferences
6:168:12921:18:37:56:519:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or production functions.6In these models, the demand function for imports is given by:

6:175:13041:36:18:56:554:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This equation relates real importsM, real absorptionAbs, the price of importspm, and the
6:176:13129:18:18:56:555:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absorption price indexP, in a log-linear way. The parameterθis the price elasticity of imports,

6:178:13282:24:18:57:555:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We use the structure of equation (1) to summarize key features of the data. We do so in two
6:179:13373:18:37:56:284:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ways. Our first exercise runs the regression

6:186:13451:35:18:56:555:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Relative to equation (1), the coefficientαmeasures the empirical price elasticity, andβmeasures
6:187:13546:18:18:56:555:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the empirical income elasticity. These empirical elasticities inform us about the response of real
6:188:13644:18:18:56:555:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports to changes in income and import prices, and allow us to examine the extent to which
6:189:13735:18:25:56:414:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:standard models deviate from the relationship observed in the data.
6:190:13802:25:18:57:554:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The second exercise imposes the theoretical restrictions implied by equation (1), a unit income
6:191:13897:18:18:56:555:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity and an assumed value for the price elasticity, and uses the data on income and import
6:192:13993:18:18:56:554:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices to obtain a measure of predicted imports. Finally, we infer the wedgeωby comparing

6:194:14189:16:12:56:555:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:pose balanced trade, in these models absorption corresponds with income. Hence, we use absorption and income
6:195:14297:12:8:56:122:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:synonymously.
6:196:14310:8:16:70:555:157:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:6We think of standard models as those that generate log-linear import demand functions, also known as gravity
6:197:14419:16:12:56:558:141:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:equations. Examples of standard models are those ofKrugman(1980), Anderson and van Wincoop(2003), Eaton
6:198:14522:12:12:56:555:129:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:and Kortum(2002), andMelitz(2003) or international business-cycle models such asBackus, Kehoe, and Kydland

7:212:14844:17:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Tesar(2010a). Following the arguments ofChari, Kehoe, and McGrattan(2007), this exercise is

7:215:15115:18:18:56:555:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:business cycle, then this suggests that: (i) that there are economic forces that are not reflected in
7:216:15216:18:18:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equation (1); and (ii) that any new mechanism posited to explain these deviations should oper-

7:218:15403:18:18:56:555:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international business-cycle literature. Using largerθs, as in typical calibrations of international
7:219:15503:18:32:56:260:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade models, results in larger wedges.

7:221:15565:28:18:57:555:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are several issues in constructing data for use in the regression in (2) and wedge analysis
7:222:15662:18:18:56:555:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in (  3). They are: (i) the appropriate definitions of imports and absorption; and (ii) how to
7:223:15756:18:18:56:555:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:construct the appropriate real measures and their associated price indices. Because these are
7:224:15849:18:18:56:555:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important issues, we spend several paragraphs here describing the construction of our data
7:225:15939:18:24:56:89:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series.
7:226:15946:24:18:57:554:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We focus our analysis on imports and absorption of goods, excluding oil. The National In-

7:228:16123:18:25:56:554:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coming from goods sales. AppendixA provides the details of the exact data series that we use.
7:229:16216:25:18:57:555:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The focus on goods GDP helps address compositional issues of the sort emphasized byEaton,
7:230:16305:18:18:56:554:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis(2013). To address these compositional issues, we focus on an
7:231:16393:18:17:56:555:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absorption measure where most trade occurs (goods-only component of GDP). To address com-
7:232:16482:17:18:56:555:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positional issues within goods (i.e., durable vs. non-durable) emphasized byBoileau(1999) and
7:233:16575:18:18:56:555:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Engel and Wang(2011), we perform the same analysis later in this section using only durable
7:234:16666:18:25:56:174:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or non-durable goods.
7:235:16687:25:18:57:557:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Constructing real measures of these activities and their associated price indices is not as straight-
7:236:16788:18:18:56:555:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forward as it might seem. Real values in the U.S. NIPA accounts are chain-type indexes con-

7:238:16967:18:17:56:555:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desirable properties, they are not additive across categories (seeEhemann, Katz, and Moulton
7:239:17059:17:18:56:555:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2002) andWhelan(2002) for detailed discussions). For our purposes, the implication is that
7:240:17150:18:18:56:555:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one cannot compute real absorption simply by adding real goods GDP to real imports and sub-
7:241:17241:18:0:56:555:69:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tracting real exports. An (approximate) solution to this problem is to use a “Fisher of Fishers”

8:251:17617:48:18:56:554:548:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approach suggested byDiewert(1978). The basic idea is to take the real values and their as-
8:252:17708:18:18:56:555:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sociated price indexes for the categories of interest and then compute Fisher indexes of these
8:253:17802:18:24:56:305:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures—hence the “Fisher of Fishers” name.
8:254:17846:24:18:57:554:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Using this approach, we construct data series for real absorption of goods, real imports of
8:255:17937:18:18:56:555:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods, and their associated price indexes starting in the second quarter of 1967 and ending in
8:256:18031:18:18:56:555:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the fourth quarter of 2013. To deal with trends, we HP-filter the logarithm of these data with
8:257:18125:18:32:56:548:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smoothing parameter 1600. Results using log-first-differences yield no significant differences.

8:259:18290:28:18:57:555:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table1 presents the estimated income and price elasticities of imports, using ordinary least
8:260:18382:18:18:56:571:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:squares to estimate equation (2). Figure2(a)   plots the result from the wedge accounting exer-
8:261:18477:18:31:56:386:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cise. Below we outline three observations from these exercises.
8:262:18540:31:18:57:555:307:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:O.1. Income elasticity>1.The estimated income elasticity of imports is nearly two—i.e., a
8:263:18629:18:18:56:554:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one-percent increase in absorption is associated with a two-percent increase in imports. Figure
8:264:18724:18:17:56:555:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1(a)   illustrates this finding by plotting the percent deviations from trend of real absorption and
8:265:18824:17:18:56:554:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports. Consistent with the findings in Table1, absorption correlates strongly with imports,
8:266:18917:18:25:56:226:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yet it is less than half as volatile.
8:267:18954:25:18:57:554:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This feature of the data is interesting because it contrasts with the implication of standard mod-
8:268:19052:18:18:56:554:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:els of international trade. These models imply that a one-percent increase in absorption results
8:269:19148:18:18:56:555:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a one-percent increase in imports—i.e., these models feature a unit income elasticity. Thus,
8:270:19243:18:18:56:555:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:attempts at modeling trade volumes at business-cycle frequencies must confront this discrep-
8:271:19335:18:24:56:323:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ancy between standard trade models and the data.
8:272:19383:24:18:57:554:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As mentioned above, the fact that the estimated income elasticity of demand for U.S. imports
8:273:19475:18:19:56:555:97:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exceeds unity is not new, and dates back toHouthakker and Magee(1969).7Marquez(2002)
8:274:19559:19:15:70:555:78:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:7Prominent explanations of the high income elasticity of import demand are largely based on expanding prod-

10:307:20138:0:18:56:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:examines this feature of the data from a modern perspective and finds that it is robust to alter-
10:308:20235:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:native econometric specifications, different frequencies, and commodity disaggregation. At a
10:309:20327:18:18:56:554:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:disaggregated level,Fitzgerald and Haller(2012) find a high income elasticity (and low price
10:310:20419:18:24:56:349:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity) at the plant level in census data from Ireland.
10:311:20478:24:18:57:554:645:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:O.2. Low price elasticity.Our second observation is that the estimated import price elasticity
10:312:20572:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is−0.26. Figure1(b)illustrates this finding. It plots the percent deviations from trend of rel-
10:313:20667:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ative pricespm,tPtand import data. Notice that prices and imports weakly correlate with each
10:314:20759:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other negatively and, in some instances, even move in the same direction. Thus, the low price
10:315:20852:18:24:56:247:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity in Table1 is not a surprise.
10:316:20891:24:18:57:554:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:While modelers have a choice over this parameter, typical calibrations/estimations of static
10:317:20983:18:18:56:555:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade models or international business-cycle models generally use values of it that are consid-
10:318:21078:18:18:56:555:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:erably larger. Moreover, estimates of this parameter based on static trade models and changes
10:319:21171:18:18:56:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in trade flows during trade liberalizations typically suggest substantially higher values of it.
10:320:21267:18:18:56:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Lower values, but still higher than we estimate, typically come from imposing a unitary in-
10:321:21358:18:18:56:554:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:come elasticity and using time series variation in prices and trade flows relative to absorption.
10:322:21455:18:24:56:524:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Ruhl(2008) provides an extensive discussion of the conflicting estimates of this elasticity.
10:323:21547:24:18:57:555:417:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:O.3. Pro-cyclical wedges.Our last observation is that the wedges inferred using equation (3)
10:324:21639:18:25:56:379:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are pro-cyclical and explain much of the variation in imports.
10:325:21701:25:18:57:554:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure2(a)simply plots the wedge and the imports data. For most of the time period, the
10:326:21788:18:18:56:555:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wedge tracks imports very closely.  Confirming this, a regression of imports on the wedge
10:327:21877:18:17:56:555:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yields a slope coefficient of0.70and anR2of0.42. This suggests that systematic variation in the
10:328:21972:17:18:56:554:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wedge is quantitatively important to understanding variation in imports. Given the discussion
10:329:22065:18:18:56:555:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above, this observation suggests that there are economic forces that are operative in the data
10:330:22159:18:25:56:302:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but not in models consistent with equation (1).
10:331:22206:25:18:57:555:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Systematic variation in the trade wedge is not distinct from observationsO.1andO.2. Standard
10:332:22298:18:18:56:554:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade models basically have stronger substitution effects relative to income effects—i.e., imports
10:333:22396:18:18:56:555:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:should be more responsive to a one-percent change in prices relative to a one-percent change
10:334:22488:18:17:56:555:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in income. The data observationsO.1andO.2suggest the complete opposite pattern—imports
10:335:22574:17:18:56:555:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are less responsive to prices relative to income. Thus, the wedge analysis based on a model
10:336:22665:18:18:56:555:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that puts more weight on relative price changes versus changes in income is bound to find
10:337:22754:18:25:56:267:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:systematic variation in the trade wedge.
10:338:22794:25:22:57:554:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The 2008-2009 crisis illustrates this point well. During this period, absorption decreased and
10:339:22888:22:12:56:555:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:tions. Quantitatively,Feenstra(1994) shows that the expanding product variety explanation can account for only
10:340:22998:12:12:56:554:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:a part of the high income elasticity.Ruhl(2008) shows that this margin is not quantitatively important at business-
10:341:23113:12:12:56:555:82:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:cycle frequencies.Kehoe and Ruhl(2013) measure changes in the extensive margin and find that it playslittle role
10:342:23225:12:0:56:367:70:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:outside of significant structural transformations or trade liberalization.

12:374:23657:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports decreased even more—this reflects the high income elasticity. When the income elastic-
12:375:23751:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity is constrained to be one in the wedge analysis, the wedge must then decrease to rationalize
12:376:23846:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the drop in imports. Furthermore, relative prices decreased and imports did not increase as pre-
12:377:23942:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dicted by the standard model—this reflects the low price elasticity. When the price elasticity is
12:378:24039:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constrained to take on a standard value, this implies that the wedge must decrease even more.
12:379:24132:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, the fact that imports over-respond to income and under-respond to prices manifests itself
12:380:24227:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as a pro-cyclical wedge when events like the 2008-2009 recession are analyzed in the context of

12:383:24385:28:18:57:554:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Recent papers on the collapse in trade during the 2008-2009 crisis have raised two issues: the
12:384:24479:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distinction between durables and non-durables, and the role of inventories. Here, we show
12:385:24568:18:18:56:554:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that observationsO.1-3are robust to restricting attention to durables or non-durable goods,
12:386:24659:18:24:56:304:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and accounting for the behavior of inventories.
12:387:24706:24:18:57:555:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Durables vs. Non-Durables.One concern is that observationsO.1-3are just picking up com-
12:388:24793:18:18:56:555:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positional effects of the sort described byBoileau(1999) andEngel and Wang(2011). The ar-
12:389:24882:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gument is based on the fact that a larger fraction of imports is classified as durable than in,
12:390:24977:18:18:56:555:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:say, absorption of total goods. This observation, combined with the fact that consumption of
12:391:25069:18:18:56:555:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:durables is more volatile than that of non-durables, suggests that an income elasticity larger
12:392:25163:18:18:56:555:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than unity or pro-cyclical trade wedges may arise because of the compositional difference.
12:393:25253:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, the durables composition explanation suggests that if we focused on only durables
12:394:25345:18:24:56:368:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or non-durables, then observationsO.1-3would disappear.
12:395:25400:24:18:57:555:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We address this argument by re-estimating equation (2) restricting the import, absorption, and
12:396:25494:18:18:56:555:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price data to include only durable goods or only non-durables. AppendixA provides the details
12:397:25587:18:24:56:242:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the exact data series that we use.
12:398:25624:24:18:57:555:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table2 presents our results. It shows that the income elasticity of imports of durables is well
12:399:25719:18:18:56:555:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above one (albeit mitigated), and the import price elasticity is similar to that found in Table1.
12:400:25816:18:18:56:555:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:When the data are restricted to only non-durables, one finds a very high income elasticity and
12:401:25910:18:25:56:161:195:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:low price elasticity.8
12:402:25932:25:17:57:555:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The durable trade wedge still accounts for a lot of the variation in imports. Figure2(b)illus-
12:403:26026:17:18:56:555:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trates this by plotting the trade wedge for durable goods only. Similar to the results discussed in
12:404:26125:18:18:56:554:135:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:O.3, a regression of imports on the wedge yields a slope coefficient of0.80and anR2of0.42. The
12:405:26219:18:18:56:555:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reasoning is the same as discussed above: though the data suggests that imports of durables
12:406:26310:18:19:56:555:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are more responsive to income than to changes in relative prices, standard models predict the
12:407:26403:19:16:70:554:80:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:8Some care must be taken with this observation because available measures of non-durable imports include
12:408:26507:16:0:56:270:64:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:petroleum products, unlike the other data series.

13:436:27011:48:18:56:554:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:opposite pattern. Thus, while the income elasticity is mitigated, the relative weighting of the
13:437:27106:18:24:56:434:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income and substitution effects still conflict with what the data suggest.
13:438:27180:24:18:57:554:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Another implication of the durable goods explanation is the following: we should observe that
13:439:27273:18:18:56:554:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the income elasticity of imports is higher when the share of durables in imports is large relative
13:440:27371:18:18:56:555:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the share of durables in total absorption—i.e., when there is a large compositional difference
13:441:27468:18:18:56:555:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between imports and absorption. Thus, we should observe a positive correlation between the
13:442:27558:18:18:56:554:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income elasticity and the share of durables in imports relative to the share of durables in total
13:443:27655:18:24:56:116:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absorption.
13:444:27666:24:18:57:555:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To explore this implication, we ran the regression in (2) for all goods on a 40-quarter moving
13:445:27760:18:18:56:554:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:window—i.e., for 1967q2-1977q1, 1967q3-1977q2, etc. We found a strong negative correlation
13:446:27850:18:18:56:555:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(−0.63and statistically different from zero) between the income elasticity and the relative share
13:447:27947:18:18:56:555:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of durables in imports. This result goes against the positive correlation that the durables expla-
13:448:28045:18:24:56:135:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nation implies.
13:449:28060:24:18:57:555:221:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Inventories.Another concern is thatO.1-3arises because we abstract from changes in inven-

13:451:28236:18:18:56:555:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline in trade flows during the 2008-2009 crisis;Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2010a)
13:452:28328:18:18:56:555:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:argue that inventory considerations are important for understanding the dynamics of devalua-
13:453:28420:18:18:56:555:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions. An implication ofAlessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan’s (2010b) model is that the regres-
13:454:28514:18:18:56:555:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sion equation in (2) should be augmented with the change in imported inventories(Alessan-
13:455:28603:18:19:56:372:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2011) provide this derivation).
13:456:28662:19:15:70:555:94:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:9Feenstra(1994) suggests this, as well, and uses real personal consumption to instrument for the fact that
13:457:28768:15:12:56:555:79:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:changes in inventories are not controlled for. We did this and found that the estimated price and income elasticities
13:458:28885:12:0:56:139:67:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:are−0.52and2.34.
14:459:28903:0:18:57:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We followed this argument by augmenting the regression in (2) by including data on the real
14:460:28994:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change in private inventories as an additional explanatory variable. Separate information on
14:461:29086:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in inventories of imported goods is unavailable. The third row in Table2 reports the
14:462:29178:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results. After controlling for changes in inventories, the income elasticity is1.65, relative to
14:463:29274:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:B:1.99without controlling for inventories. Including inventories also improves the fit of the re-
14:464:29369:18:18:56:554:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gression from anR2of0.65without inventories to0.73with inventories. These results suggest
14:465:29458:18:18:56:554:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that inventory adjustments are a partial, but not a complete explanation, of the high income
14:466:29550:18:30:56:283:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities observed at cyclical frequencies.
14:467:29596:30:18:57:554:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the next sections, we argue that systematic variation in intertemporal substitution can ra-

14:469:29783:18:18:56:554:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:because we model the decision to import as a dynamic decision. With a finite intertempo-

14:471:29967:18:18:56:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumption today versus expectations of consumption tomorrow. Changes in endowments and
14:472:30052:18:18:56:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices affect the trade-off between consumption today and consumption tomorrow, and, thus,

15:498:31260:0:18:57:555:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Every period, the consumer in a typical home country receivesa stochastic endowment of good
15:499:31351:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:x, while the consumer in a typical foreign country receives a stochastic endowment of goody.
15:500:31443:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These endowments are idiosyncratic to each particular country, and can be either consumed
15:501:31532:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestically or used to acquire foreign goods through a centralized goods market.  Goods
15:502:31620:18:24:56:154:651:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:cannot be stored.10
15:503:31639:24:18:57:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:International trade consists of the exchange of one type of good for another type of good. In-
15:504:31733:18:18:56:555:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ternational trade is subject to two technological constraints. First, agents in each country face
15:505:31830:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:iceberg trade costs,τ >1, to move goods across borders. This implies that for everyτunits of a
15:506:31924:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:good that are shipped, only one unit arrives at a destination. We assume that goods cannot be
15:507:32017:18:24:56:120:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:re-exported.
15:508:32029:24:18:57:555:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, international purchases take time.11We model this as a time-to-ship friction, such
15:509:32119:18:18:56:554:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that if the home country purchases one unit of goodyat datet, the good arrives (and is only
15:510:32210:18:18:56:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:available for consumption) at datet+ 1. Along with this assumption, we assume that goods
15:511:32298:18:18:56:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must be paid for before they are delivered.12Underlying this international trading structure is
15:512:32393:18:18:56:555:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an assumed enforcement technology that allows countries to coordinate the dynamic exchange
15:513:32483:18:24:56:254:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of goods across international borders.
15:514:32521:24:18:57:554:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We abstract from trade in international financial assets.13This does not imply that the typical
15:515:32616:18:18:56:555:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agent is in financial autarky. Because of the timing assumption on international trade, trade in
15:516:32712:18:18:56:555:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods is equivalent to purchasing a one-period non-state-contingent bond that pays out in units
15:517:32807:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the foreign good in the next period. Thus, international trade acts implicitly as a financial
15:518:32903:18:18:56:555:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset in this model. With this insight, and noting that each country faces idiosyncratic risk
15:519:32996:18:18:56:555:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in endowments, this model is closely related to the one-good incomplete market models of
15:520:33084:18:18:56:555:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Huggett(1993) andAiyagari(1994), and specifically toCastro’s (  2005) reinterpretation of these
15:521:33179:18:24:56:302:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models to countries rather than to individuals.
15:522:33226:24:18:57:554:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:With these assumptions, the consumer in a typical home country faces the following budget
15:523:33315:18:33:56:112:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint:

15:525:33351:19:16:67:555:197:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:10The shipping technology to trade goods internationally does actually provide a method to store goods, where
15:526:33460:16:11:56:555:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:the consumer could send part of his endowment away for delivery next period. However, given the size ofτ, we
15:527:33568:11:9:56:311:170:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:conjecture that this would not be an equilibrium outcome.
15:528:33625:9:16:67:555:161:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:11Empirically,Hummels(2007), Djankov, Freund, and Pham(2010), Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2010a)
15:529:33728:16:8:56:511:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:and  Hummels and Schaur(2013) document the time-intensive nature of shipping goods across borders.
15:530:33826:8:16:67:555:137:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:12In reality, a variety of payment arrangements are used. The payment structure in the model is known as “cash
15:531:33936:16:11:56:555:121:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:in advance.” SeeCapela(2011) for a description of how international transactions take place. At the aggregate
15:532:34045:11:12:56:555:110:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:level, it is hard to find evidence about the composition of payment structures of international trade.Antras and
15:533:34157:12:12:56:555:98:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Foley(2011) provide evidence from a large U.S.-based exporter that cashin advance accounts for a large share of
15:534:34268:12:9:56:171:86:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:international transactions.
15:535:34295:9:15:67:555:77:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:13Evidence on the international asset structure that agents have access to is limited, and what is available points
15:536:34410:15:0:56:371:62:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:towards financial autarky; see, for example,Heathcote and Perri(2002).

16:541:34830:24:18:57:555:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:B:Inspecting the budget constraint (6), one realizes that the value of imports ordered at datet

16:553:35258:17:18:56:555:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to, or depart from, the home country, as it is done by statistical agencies in the U.S. Then, we
16:554:35354:18:18:56:555:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have that trade is not balanced period by period as in static trade models, and, thus, our model
16:555:35450:18:18:56:555:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:features a non-zero current account. In the model, the current account equals the difference in
16:556:35545:18:18:56:555:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:orders of imports and arrivals of imports. Consistent with the idea of international trade being
16:557:35641:18:18:56:555:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar to asset trade, a positive current account acts as an increase in savings since consump-

16:559:35821:24:18:57:554:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Given the description of the model, we now focus on the problem of a consumer located in a
16:560:35911:18:56:56:545:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particular home country. The consumer faces the following dynamic programming problem:

16:570:36099:33:18:56:554:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are four state variables in the problem. The first three state variables are the consumer’s

16:573:36375:18:18:56:555:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The consumer takes the aggregate pricespytandpxtas given and forms expectations of future

16:575:36559:18:18:56:555:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:orders of imports arriving for consumption this period. Given the state variables, the consumer
16:576:36654:18:18:56:554:123:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f13:B:chooses the quantity of goodxto be consumed this period and chooses the quantity of goody′
16:577:36744:18:24:56:398:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to order internationally for consumption in the following period.

17:583:37161:24:18:57:555:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The idea here is to model endowments and prices as following a stochastic process and esti-

17:586:37435:18:18:56:554:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desire to answer the following quantitative question in a simple and straightforward way: If a
17:587:37529:18:18:56:555:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:typical agent faces an endowment and price process like the one we observe in the data, then
17:588:37621:18:18:56:555:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:what are the implications for imports? Directly specifying a stochastic process over prices and
17:589:37716:18:18:56:554:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimating it from data allows us to answer this question in a straightforward manner, without
17:590:37810:18:17:56:554:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:having to set up a general equilibrium model that generates an equilibrium process of output
17:591:37902:17:18:56:554:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and prices as observed in the data. Because we are not interested in world-economy outcomes
17:592:37993:18:18:56:555:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or in performing counterfactuals, this approach allows us to sidestep this more involved alter-

17:594:38095:32:29:56:191:404:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.1. Qualitative Features
17:595:38120:29:18:57:555:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we study some qualitative features of the model to develop the intuition behind
17:596:38216:18:24:56:406:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the mechanism that underlies our quantitative results in Section4.
17:597:38282:24:18:57:555:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below we derive a dynamic import demand equation and then use this equation to walk
17:598:38365:18:18:56:555:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through examples as to how and why imports respond to orthogonal endowment or price
17:599:38448:18:18:56:555:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks. To ease the exposition, we restrict attention to the special case in which the shocks are
17:600:38545:18:18:56:555:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:orthogonal and the non-diagonal terms of the VAR are set to zero. In the quantitative analysis
17:601:38639:18:18:56:554:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we relax these assumptions and estimate the unconstrained VAR and the covariance structure
17:602:38729:18:18:56:555:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the shocks directly from US data. The key result is this section is that the our model is able to
17:603:38829:18:18:56:555:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deliver an income elasticity of imports greater than one and a price elasticity of imports below
17:604:38925:18:24:56:260:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the calibrated elasticity of substitution.
17:605:38967:24:18:57:554:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There is one caveat we must mention up front. The ability of or model to deliver these results
17:606:39061:18:18:56:555:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not ensure that it will empirically. The ability of the model to replicate the patterns seen
17:607:39158:18:18:56:555:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in U.S. data very much depends on the covariance structure of the shocks to endowments and
17:608:39248:18:24:56:276:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices and hence is an empirical question.
17:609:39290:24:18:57:554:105:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Dynamic Import Demand.The key relationship in our model is the dynamic demand function
17:610:39376:18:0:56:555:87:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for imports. After solving the representative consumer’s problem, the demand for imports in
18:611:39469:0:33:56:245:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the home country can be written as:

18:634:39607:54:18:56:561:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are several points to note about equation (10 ). First, the timing: endowments and prices
18:635:39702:18:18:56:555:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at datetaffect imports consumed/delivered at datet+ 1. This is in contrast to the contempora-
18:636:39795:18:18:56:555:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:neous effects of endowments and prices on the import decision in equation (1) that comes from
18:637:39888:18:24:56:494:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:astandard static trade model. This is a direct result of the time-to-ship assumption.
18:638:39973:24:18:57:555:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, the termEt(  ̃mt+1)enters equation (10 ). The term ̃mt+1is an implicit function of the
18:639:40067:18:18:56:555:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:standard intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) in theories of asset prices and con-
18:640:40163:18:18:56:555:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumption with CRRA preferences.14This term induces the demand for imports to depend on
18:641:40249:18:18:56:555:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the agent’s willingness to substitute consumption today (i.e. spending less on home goods to-
18:642:40342:18:18:56:555:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:day) for consumption tomorrow (i.e. imports arrive tomorrow); the termEt(  ̃mt+1)reflects this
18:643:40436:18:24:56:109:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:valuation.
18:644:40446:24:18:57:555:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:An important difference between ̃mt+1and the IMRS is that1θshows up along with the param-
18:645:40535:18:18:56:555:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eterγ.15The reason is that goodxis not a perfect substitute for goody. Thus, the elasticity
18:646:40626:18:18:56:555:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of substitution across goods shows up with the intertemporal elasticity. The special case when
18:647:40720:18:18:56:554:333:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:xandyare perfect substitutes (implyingθ=∞) illustrates this point, as only the parameter
18:648:40808:18:18:56:555:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:γshows up in ̃mt+1. In contrast, when the elasticity of substitution equals the intertemporal
18:649:40901:18:18:56:555:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity,θ=1γ,variation in consumption across time periods plays no role and ̃mt+1=β. The
18:650:40992:18:18:56:555:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intuition behind this is that whenγ=1θ,the benefits from smoothing consumption are offset
18:651:41081:18:18:56:555:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the imperfect substitutability of the good through which this smoothing is done, such that
18:652:41174:18:24:56:532:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the agent is indifferent between current and next period’s consumption (up to factor beta).
18:653:41265:24:18:57:554:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, note that the IMRS changes with the endowments and prices. Thus, systematic vari-
18:654:41355:18:18:56:554:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ation in the IMRS leads to systematic variation inEt(  ̃mt+1), implying that the model’s income
18:655:41450:18:18:56:555:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity will generally differ from one and the price elasticity will generally differ fromθ; the
18:656:41549:18:18:56:555:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:direction and magnitude of the difference, however, is a quantitative question. Moreover, be-
18:657:41642:18:18:56:555:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:causeEt(  ̃mt+1)shows up in the same places as the trade friction, variation in the IMRS has the
18:658:41738:18:20:56:304:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ability to look like a time-varying trade wedge.
18:659:41786:20:15:67:555:109:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:14To keep terminology and notation clear, the IMRS ismt+1=β(Qt+1/Qt)−γ—i.e., the marginal rate of substi-
18:660:41891:15:9:56:407:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:tution of aggregate consumption. The term ̃mt+1is an implicit function ofmt+1.
18:661:41969:9:15:67:555:85:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:15A more subtle point is that time-to-ship works similarly to habits as decisions yesterday impact utility today
18:662:42081:15:0:56:555:70:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:(see   Campbell and Cochrane(1999)). A key difference is that these decisions are internalized, unlike external habit.

19:683:42536:35:18:57:554:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below, we describe how this mechanism can deliver an income elasticity greater than unity
19:684:42625:18:17:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and an artificially low price elasticity. We focus on the empirically relevant part of the param-
19:685:42722:17:18:56:554:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eter space (γ−1θ>0). We then restrict the stochastic process (for simplicity) to independent
19:686:42814:18:18:56:555:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:AR(1) processes describing the evolution of endowments and prices. As we discuss below, this
19:687:42906:18:25:56:554:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simplifying assumption is not innocuous, however, it cleanly illustrates how the model works.
19:688:42999:25:18:57:555:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Income Elasticity Greater than Unity.Our economy can generate an income elasticity of im-
19:689:43088:18:18:56:554:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ports that is greater than one. To gain intuition regarding this result, assume that the economy
19:690:43184:18:24:56:503:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is initially in steady-state and then hit by a negative shock to endowmentztat datet.
19:691:43269:24:18:57:554:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As a result of the shock, two forces work to affect imports. First, a negative shock toztdirectly
19:692:43366:18:18:56:555:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lowers imports tomorrow since expenditures decrease. This is the standard force in static trade
19:693:43461:18:18:56:555:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models. Second, a negative shock decreases the agent’s willingness to substitute across time,
19:694:43554:18:18:56:554:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pushingEt(  ̃mt+1)down, further lowering imports. This is where dynamics bite. Because of the
19:695:43647:18:18:56:554:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline in the endowmentandthe decline inEt(  ̃mt+1), imports drop more than proportionally
19:696:43738:18:24:56:217:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the drop in the endowment.
19:697:43767:24:18:57:555:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The dynamic force deserves more explanation. Because the endowment is scarce at datet,
19:698:43853:18:18:56:555:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal utility in that period is high. Moreover, becauseztis below its steady-state value, the
19:699:43949:18:18:56:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agent rationally expects the endowment to be relatively higher tomorrow—i.e.,Et(zt+1)> zt. A
19:700:44041:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relatively higher level of endowment means more consumption tomorrow, decreasing expected
19:701:44130:18:18:56:555:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal utility tomorrow. Together, these forces imply thatEt(  ̃mt+1)declines with a negative
19:702:44225:18:18:56:554:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:endowment shock. Because of howEt(  ̃mt+1)enters equation (10 ), a decrease inEt( ̃mt+1)lowers
19:703:44319:18:0:56:333:76:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports more than the drop in the endowment does.

20:724:44697:35:18:57:555:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figures3(a)   and 3(b)   trace these arguments out. Figure3(a)   plots the decline inEt( ̃mt+1), when
20:725:44798:18:17:56:555:436:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:ztis perturbed below its non-stochastic steady state and the economy is allowed to transit back.
20:726:44894:17:18:56:555:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure3(b)plots the corresponding response of imports and endowments.The figure shows
20:727:44979:18:18:56:555:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that imports decline by more than the endowment shock. The difference is purely because of
20:728:45069:18:18:56:554:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the change in agent’s willingness to substitute across time in response to the endowment shock.
20:729:45164:18:18:56:555:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In contrast, in a static model, imports would move by the exact same amount as the move in
20:730:45254:18:25:56:128:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:endowments.
20:731:45265:25:18:57:554:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:B:Low Price Elasticity.Our economy can also generate a price elasticity that is artificially below
20:732:45361:18:17:56:555:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:the elasticity of substitutionθ. To gain intuition regarding this result, again assume thatγ−1θ>0
20:733:45458:17:18:56:555:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and that the economy is initially in steady state and then hit by a negative price shock topy,tat

20:735:45561:25:18:57:555:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As a result of the shock, imports increase by less thanθ. The reason is that there are two forces
20:736:45658:18:18:56:555:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:working in opposite directions. First, a lowerpy,tdirectly increases imports tomorrow byθ.
20:737:45748:18:18:56:555:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is the standard force from static trade models. Second, a negative price shock decreases
20:738:45841:18:18:56:554:190:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:Et(  ̃mt+1)pushing imports in theoppositedirection of the first force. Because these two forces
20:739:45936:18:24:56:376:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work in opposing directions, imports increase by less thanθ.
20:740:45996:24:18:57:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Why does a lower price of imports decreaseEt(  ̃mt+1)? This shock makes agents “wealthier”
20:741:46086:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the future because imports delivered tomorrow cost less. This leads to an increase in ex-
20:742:46178:18:18:56:555:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pected aggregate consumption and lower expected marginal utility in the next period, lower-
20:743:46269:18:18:56:555:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ingEt(  ̃mt+1). Because of howEt(  ̃mt+1)enters equation (10 ), a decrease inE( ̃mt+1)is a force to
20:744:46368:18:0:56:149:76:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decrease imports.
21:745:46387:0:18:57:571:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure4(a)   and4(b)illustrate these arguments. Figure4(a)   plots the decline in the stochastic
21:746:46483:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discount factor whenpy,tis perturbed below its non-stochastic steady state and the economy
21:747:46573:18:18:56:572:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is allowed to transit back. Figure4(b)   plots the corresponding response of imports and prices.
21:748:46669:18:18:56:560:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Here, the response in prices is the response of the term(pytPt)−θ1Ptfrom (10 ). This is the object
21:749:46767:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of interest because in the static model, imports should respond one for one with this term. In
21:750:46861:18:18:56:555:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, Figure4(b)shows that imports rise less than the response of the price term. Again,
21:751:46953:18:18:56:555:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the difference between imports and the price term arises because of the change in the agent’s
21:752:47046:18:24:56:409:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:willingness to substitute across time in response to the price shock.
21:753:47115:24:18:57:554:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The previous discussions considered orthogonal shocks to endowments and prices and their
21:754:47203:18:18:56:555:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects. If there is non-zero covariance between endowment and prices shocks, then their dy-
21:755:47295:18:18:56:555:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:namic effects on the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution could offset or reinforce each
21:756:47390:18:18:56:555:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other. For example, if states of the world with low endowments are also likely to have high
21:757:47481:18:18:56:554:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative prices of imports, then both shocks would have offsetting effects on the intertemporal
21:758:47576:18:24:56:436:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:marginal rate of substitution, potentially nullifying its effect on imports.
21:759:47652:24:18:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This observation is important for two reasons. First, it influenced our choice to model endow-
21:760:47746:18:18:56:554:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments and prices as a stochastic process. This allows us to isolate the role of intertemporal
21:761:47839:18:18:56:555:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:substitution with a stochastic endowment and price process that is estimated directly from the
21:762:47933:18:18:56:555:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data. Second, our model’s ability to replicate observationsO.1andO.2is not predetermined.
21:763:48022:18:18:56:555:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Because there exist covariance structures that can influence the results, the data provides im-
21:764:48117:18:41:56:494:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portant discipline on our model’s ability to capture cyclical features of import data.
21:765:48203:41:29:56:218:328:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4. Quantitative Analysis
21:766:48227:29:17:57:555:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we study the quantitative properties of our model. The quantitative question
21:767:48320:17:18:56:555:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that motivates our analysis is: How do the time-to-ship friction and finite intertemporal elas-
21:768:48415:18:18:56:555:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticity of substitution shape the decision to import, given a stochastic process describing output
21:769:48512:18:25:56:264:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and prices as estimated from U.S. data?
21:770:48551:25:18:57:554:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To answer this question we estimate the endowment and price process from U.S. data and
21:771:48637:18:18:56:555:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we then simulate time paths of imports, absorption, and prices from our model. We then use
21:772:48727:18:18:56:555:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equation (2) as a lens through which to examine co-movement in the simulated data. In this
21:773:48817:18:17:56:555:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section we focus specifically on how the model implied income and price elasticities depend on
21:774:48911:17:18:56:555:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parameter values. The next section focuses on the ability of the model to account for the actual
21:775:49007:18:0:56:193:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics of U.S. imports.
22:776:49034:0:28:56:142:722:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.1. Calibration
22:777:49050:28:18:57:555:694:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As a benchmark, we take a time period in the model to represent one quarter in the data, which
22:778:49144:18:18:56:554:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies that it takes one quarter for international goods to arrive. This assumption is stark,
22:779:49238:18:18:56:555:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but in line with previous calibrations—see, e.g.,Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2010b).
22:780:49329:18:18:56:555:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:They motivate their choice based on evidence fromDjankov, Freund, and Pham(2010), who
22:781:49414:18:18:56:555:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:show that the extra time it takes to ship a good internationally is, on average, between 1.5 to
22:782:49509:18:18:56:555:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two months.Amiti and Weinstein(2011) provide a nice discussion of this evidence and argue
22:783:49598:18:17:56:555:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that trade finance leads to further time impediments. We recognize that there is heterogeneity
22:784:49692:17:18:56:555:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the speed of the international delivery of goods, (see, e.g.,Hummels(2007) andHummels
22:785:49780:18:18:56:564:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Schaur(2013)) and, thus, we loosen this assumption in later in Section4.3  . Moreover, we
22:786:49873:18:25:56:356:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide additional evidence on time-to-ship in Section6.
22:787:49929:25:18:57:555:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We explore different values of the parameterγ={1θ,2,5,10}, which controls the agent’s in-
22:788:50018:18:18:56:555:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tertemporal elasticity of substitution over aggregate consumption. As discussed earlier, the
22:789:50110:18:18:56:555:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case whenγ=1θis interesting because ̃mt+1is constant in this case and equals the subjective
22:790:50201:18:17:56:555:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discount rate. We set the discount factorβequal to0.995. This value implies a steady-state real
22:791:50296:17:18:56:555:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:annual interest rate of two percent which is consistent with the data on ex-post real returns on
22:792:50392:18:25:56:382:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:near-risk-free assets (see, e.g.,Tallarini(2000) or   Barro(2006)).
22:793:50459:25:18:57:554:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The baseline value we use for the elasticity of substitution is1.5, which is the standard value
22:794:50554:18:18:56:554:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:used in calibrations of international real business-cycle models, (seeBackus, Kehoe, and Kyd-
22:795:50647:18:18:56:555:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:land (1995)). Note that in the dynamic model, the price elasticity estimated from simulated data
22:796:50743:18:17:56:554:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:will differ from this value because of the arguments made in the previous section. Only in the
22:797:50837:17:18:56:555:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:static model without time-to-ship or the dynamic model without the IMRS playing a role will
22:798:50928:18:18:56:555:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this value correspond with the price elasticity. AppendixC reports the results with an elasticity
22:799:51025:18:18:56:554:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of substitution equal to4which is at the low end of estimates from cross-sectional data or trade
22:800:51121:18:25:56:463:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:liberalization episodes (see the discussion inSimonovska and Waugh(2014)).
22:801:51195:25:18:57:555:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The trade friction is calibrated so that imports are 15 percent of absorption. The top panel of

22:803:51356:24:18:57:555:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We estimate the stochastic process for endowments and prices (equation (9)) using HP filtered
22:804:51449:18:18:56:555:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quarterly U.S. data on real absorption (zt), absorption price index (pxt), and the import price
22:805:51544:18:18:56:554:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:index (pyt). Again, all data series include only the goods component of GDP and non-petroleum
22:806:51637:18:18:56:555:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports of goods. The rationale for choosing these series is that one can show thatzcorresponds
22:807:51732:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to absorption in the data (appropriately modified, as discussed below) andpxto its associated
22:808:51825:18:18:56:555:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price index.16Finally, import prices (appropriately modified, as discussed below) inform us
22:809:51916:18:19:56:555:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aboutpy. AppendixA provides the details on the construction of these series, andAppendixB
22:810:52005:19:15:67:555:75:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:16An alternative approach to measuringpxuses the price index for domestic consumption. We found that the
22:811:52109:15:0:56:367:60:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:quantitative results were similar across this approach and the baseline.

23:851:53131:24:18:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:An issue in the estimation of the stochastic process for endowments and prices is that we must
23:852:53225:18:18:56:555:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modify standard data series to correspond with the timing in the model. Specifically, we need
23:853:53318:18:18:56:555:112:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the variables in the data to reflect the timing at which they would be observed by the agent in

23:855:53510:18:18:56:554:76:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:collect import data and the prices on arrival at the border. Yet, in the model, these prices are
23:856:53606:18:0:56:555:58:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observed by consumers a quarter before. Thus, we adjust the data variables accordingly to
24:857:53697:0:24:56:507:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:make them consistent with the timing of our model. AppendixB provides the details.
24:858:53779:24:18:57:555:699:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The middle panel of Table3 summarizes the estimated relationship betweenzt,pyt, pxtcorre-

24:860:53960:18:18:56:555:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model with those of a model without time-to-ship, we re-estimate the relationship between

24:862:54145:18:18:56:555:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its results. The bottom panel of Table3 summarizes the estimated relationship for the no time-

24:864:54253:25:17:57:554:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, in the simulations we measure output from our model to conform with National In-

24:868:54526:28:18:57:555:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table4 presents the results from simulate time paths of imports, absorption, and prices from
24:869:54618:18:18:56:555:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our model and then regressing imports on absorption and relative prices as described in equa-
24:870:54711:18:18:56:555:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion (2). The first row replicates the empirical income and price elasticities seen in Table1. The
24:871:54809:18:17:56:555:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:second through fourth rows report the results from our model for different values ofγ. These
24:872:54901:17:25:56:437:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are the cases when variation in the IMRS impacts the decision to import.
24:873:54973:25:18:57:555:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table4 shows that our model can deliver an income elasticity greaterthan unity. As the in-
24:874:55063:18:18:56:555:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tertemporal elasticity of substitution increases, the income elasticities are1.16,1.70, and2.52.
24:875:55159:18:18:56:554:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the case ofγ= 5, the income elasticity is near the magnitude seen in the data. These results
24:876:55254:18:18:56:555:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:show that variation in the IMRS can be quantitatively strong enough to account for the high
24:877:55345:18:24:56:507:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income elasticity of imports documented in the U.S. data outlined in observationO.1.
24:878:55429:24:18:57:554:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table4 also shows that the price elasticity estimated from simulated data lies below the true
24:879:55522:18:18:56:555:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity of substitutionθ. Depending on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, our model
24:880:55619:18:18:56:554:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delivers a price elasticity of−1.07,−0.34,0.64. All are meaningfully below the calibrated elas-
24:881:55714:18:18:56:555:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticity of substitution of−1.5. In fact, withγ= 10, changes in the IMRS more than offset changes
24:882:55809:18:18:56:555:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in prices such that the price elasticity becomes positive at0.64. Again, these results show that
24:883:55905:18:18:56:554:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variation in the IMRS is strong enough to rationalize the low price elasticity outlined in obser-
24:884:56002:18:24:56:401:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vationO.2—even though the true elasticity of substitution is -1.5.
24:885:56068:24:18:57:554:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We want to emphasize that there are several aspects of these results that are surprising and
24:886:56160:18:18:56:555:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not predetermined. First, as discussed above, there exist covariance structures between en-
24:887:56251:18:18:56:555:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dowments and prices that would not deliver these results. Thus, our model’s ability to even
24:888:56342:18:18:56:554:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualitatively replicate observationsO.1andO.2was not predetermined. It turns out, however,
24:889:56432:18:18:56:555:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the estimated empirical relationship between endowments and prices plus the economic
24:890:56521:18:0:56:439:74:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:environment are able to capture well the cyclical features of import data.

25:910:57095:12:45:113:152:469:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:?:the data.
25:911:57104:45:17:57:555:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A second surprising result is that the same parameterization that generates an income elas-
25:912:57195:17:18:56:554:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ticity that is close to the data is also the same parameterization generating a price elasticity
25:913:57291:18:18:56:554:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:close to the data. There is no reason to expect this outcome from our model. In other words,
25:914:57383:18:18:56:555:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one mechanism—-systematic variation in the IMRS—simultaneouslygenerates a high income
25:915:57468:18:25:56:239:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity and a low price elasticity.
25:916:57506:25:18:57:555:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The second to last row of Table4 shows the results from the model when the intertemporal
25:917:57594:18:17:56:555:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity of substitution is set equal the elasticity of substitution across goods. This is the case
25:918:57695:17:18:56:554:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when variation in the IMRS does not affect the import decision. In this parameterization, the
25:919:57788:18:18:56:555:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price elasticity effectively corresponds with the elasticity of substitutionθand we find an in-
25:920:57883:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:come elasticity close to unity, as in the static no time-to-ship model. This shows that the timing
25:921:57981:18:25:56:455:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference between the dynamic and static models is not driving the results.
25:922:58057:25:18:57:554:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The final row shows the results when time-to-ship is turned off. This is a standard trade model
25:923:58152:18:18:56:555:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with an import demand equation corresponding with equation (1). Here, the income and price
25:924:58242:18:17:56:555:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities correspond with what the static model predicts—a price elasticity corresponding
25:925:58334:17:25:56:416:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the elasticity of substitutionθand an income elasticity of unity.
25:926:58404:25:18:57:555:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table4 reports results for an underlying elasticity of substitution,θ, set equal to 1.5. How do
25:927:58499:18:18:56:555:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our results depend on this parameter? AppendixC presents the full details, but a summary is
25:928:58590:18:18:56:555:100:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that increasingθincreases the income elasticity for all values ofγand results in larger biases
25:929:58684:18:18:56:555:82:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the estimated price elasticity. There are two reasons for this. First, an increase inθchanges

26:959:59599:28:18:57:555:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The one-period shipping technology may be too stark of an assumption, given that our model
26:960:59689:18:18:56:555:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is calibrated to a quarterly frequency. Clearly, there is heterogeneity in the speed of the inter-
26:961:59787:18:18:56:555:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:national shipping of goods and we would like to understand how accounting for the speed of
26:962:59877:18:18:56:555:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delivery affects our results. A simple way to loosen our one-period lag assumption is to posit
26:963:59971:18:33:56:489:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the following law of motion for how the consumption of imports relates to orders:
26:964:60052:33:32:150:555:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:A:c(y)t=φyt+1+ (1−φ)yt,andQt= [xρt+c(y)ρt]1/ρ,(11)

26:967:60272:18:18:56:554:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The law of motion in (11 ) reflects the idea that some orders may arrive immediately—e.g., the
26:968:60366:18:18:56:555:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shipping of goods by airplane or from nearby trading partners—while other orders arrive with
26:969:60458:18:24:56:436:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a delay—e.g., goods shipped by sea and from trading partners far away.
26:970:60528:24:18:57:561:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We solve the problem in (8), with the modifications in (11 ). We then perform the same exercise
26:971:60623:18:18:56:554:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:described above. In the results, we focus on the case withγ= 10, varying the time-to-ship

26:974:60809:19:15:67:555:75:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:17An alternative modeling strategy would be to allow for the “option” to pay for immediate delivery after
26:975:60914:15:0:56:321:60:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:endowments are realized as inHummels and Schaur(2010).
27:976:60970:0:18:56:554:723:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time-to-ship model. The third through fifth rows report the results as we increase the fraction
27:977:61065:18:18:56:554:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of orders that arrive within the same period. Not surprisingly, asφincreases, the importance of
27:978:61160:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time-to-ship diminishes, and the price and income elasticities begin to converge towards those
27:979:61254:18:18:56:555:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implied by the static model. Similar to Table4, the same parameterization that generates an
27:980:61345:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income elasticity that is close to the one in the data is also the same parameterization generating
27:981:61444:18:41:56:288:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a price elasticity close to the one in the data.

27:983:61530:29:18:57:555:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The results in Table4 and  5 are encouraging in the sense that our model can easily accountfor
27:984:61624:18:17:56:555:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cyclical properties of trade volumes in the U.S. with reasonable parameter values. This section
27:985:61719:17:25:56:509:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:focuses on the ability of our model to account for the actual dynamics of U.S. imports.
27:986:61806:25:18:57:554:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To discipline this exercise, we calibrate the model to match the empirical income and price
27:987:61897:18:18:56:555:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities observed in the data over the first half of our sample (i.e. the period from Q2 1967 to
27:988:61997:18:18:56:555:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Q4 1989). We then ask: Can our model account for the dynamics of U.S. imports in the second
27:989:62088:18:24:56:554:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:half of our sample which includes the trade collapse (i.e. the period from Q1 1990 to Q4 2013)?
27:990:62183:24:18:57:554:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We answer this question by applying the Kalman smoother to the state-space representation
27:991:62272:18:18:56:555:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of our model using U.S. data on absorption and prices over the entire Q2 1967-Q4 2013 time
27:992:62362:18:18:56:554:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period. This allows us to generate the time series of imports implied by our model given the
27:993:62454:18:18:56:555:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absorption and prices observed in the data, which we then contrast with the actual data on U.S.
27:994:62549:18:18:56:555:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports. Importantly, note that import data is only used to parameterize the model using data
27:995:62642:18:18:56:555:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from first half of the sample—it plays no role in generating the implications of our model for
27:996:62736:18:32:56:213:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the second half of the sample.
27:997:62766:32:28:56:142:285:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1. Calibration
27:998:62782:28:18:57:555:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As before, we estimate the the stochastic process for endowments and prices (equation (9))
27:999:62872:18:18:56:554:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using data on absorption and relative prices for the entire time period. Thus, the point estimates
27:1000:62970:18:18:56:555:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reported in Table3 are the values used in this exercise. Estimating the stochastic process for only
27:1001:63069:18:18:56:555:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the second half of our sample yielded nearly identical results (in terms of calibrated parameter
27:1002:63165:18:24:56:453:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:values, overall fit, trade collapse predictions, etc.) to those described below.
27:1003:63245:24:18:57:554:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We choose the intermediate time-to-ship parameter to match the average number of days that it
27:1004:63338:18:18:56:555:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:takes to ship goods into the U.S. from the time-to-ship data described in Section6. Specifically,
27:1005:63435:18:18:56:554:125:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we compute the average time-to-ship across the different countries of origin, with observations
27:1006:63530:18:18:56:554:107:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weighted by the average value of imports across the sample. We find that the average time-to-
27:1007:63623:18:18:56:555:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ship is 33 days. From the lens of our model, we interpret this value as implying that almost two
27:1008:63719:18:0:56:555:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thirds of U.S. imports arrive contemporaneously, while a third of them arrive with a delay of

28:1020:64577:18:18:56:555:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this period. We match these moments exactly with a parameterization that setsγto14.71and

28:1022:64760:18:18:56:555:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is consistent with estimates from previous studies such asHall(1988) andVissing-Jorgensen
28:1023:64849:18:18:56:555:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2002). Our estimated value ofθis very close to the value commonly used to calibrate interna-

28:1026:65027:28:18:57:555:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure5(a)   illustrates the results. It plots import data and predictions from our model for the
28:1027:65124:18:18:56:555:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:entire time period Q2 1967-Q4 2013. Preference parameters were calibrated using data to the

28:1029:65312:18:18:56:555:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the second half of the sample and, thus, can be viewed as an out of sample prediction of
28:1030:65405:18:24:56:114:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our model.
28:1031:65415:24:18:57:554:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our model performs very well. It tracks the data quite closely by capturing both the overall
28:1032:65507:18:18:56:554:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:magnitude of fluctuations and the timing of peaks and troughs. In contrast to these outcomes,

28:1034:65700:18:18:56:555:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not fit the data well and it has severe problems regarding the timing and magnitudes in
28:1035:65792:18:24:56:149:143:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:many instances.18

28:1037:65901:19:16:67:555:100:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:18There are two drops in imports that are completely unaccounted for by our model—specifically, Q1 1969 and
28:1038:66008:16:12:56:555:84:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:Q4 1971—but, there is an explanation. In Q1 1969 and parts of Q3 and Q4 1971, the U.S. suffered major shutdowns
28:1039:66119:12:12:56:555:72:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:of U.S. ports due to dock worker strikes; seeIsard(1975). Thus, these events appear to account for this discrepancy
28:1040:66234:12:0:56:201:60:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:F:between the model and the data.

30:1078:66820:18:18:56:555:705:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model’s root mean squared error is 0.030, nearly 40 percent lower then the static model (0.051).
30:1079:66916:18:18:56:555:687:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As another point of comparison, the root mean squared error from the regression in (2) is 0.037.
30:1080:67012:18:18:56:554:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In other words, our calibrated model fits the data better than the best-fitting, linear regression
30:1081:67110:18:18:56:555:651:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of imports on absorption and prices. This shows that our model can account well for cyclical
30:1082:67202:18:24:56:230:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fluctuations in U.S. imports data.
30:1083:67236:24:18:57:554:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure6 zooms in on the last 14 years to illustrate the predictions from our model with respect
30:1084:67331:18:18:56:555:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the 2008-2009 trade collapse. Our model picks up the decline in trade from 2000-2002/2003,
30:1085:67424:18:18:56:555:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the expansion in trade from 2003 to early 2008, the sharp drop from mid-2008 to 2009, and,
30:1086:67514:18:24:56:270:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:finally, the expansion seen most recently.
30:1087:67556:24:18:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The key failures of the baseline model regard the magnitude during the collapse and a one
30:1088:67645:18:18:56:555:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quarter miss in picking up the trough of the collapse. The last row of Table6 reports the results
30:1089:67742:18:18:56:555:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regarding the percent deviation from trend during Q2 2009, which is the trough of the cycle. In
30:1090:67837:18:18:56:555:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the data, imports were 22 percent below trend; the model, however, is only 11 percent below
30:1091:67928:18:18:56:555:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trend. Part of this miss is because the model predicts the trough to be Q1 2009 and 13 percent
30:1092:68022:18:18:56:554:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:below trend. Overall, from peak to trough, our model predicts a 20 percent change in imports
30:1093:68114:18:24:56:315:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to the 30 percent change seen in the data.
30:1094:68165:24:18:57:554:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are meaningful ways of thinking about this discrepancy between the model and the data.
30:1095:68257:18:18:56:555:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Researchers have argued that there are important mechanisms specific to the 2008-2009 crisis
30:1096:68349:18:18:56:555:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that are not in our model. Explicit mechanisms put forth are shocks in trade finance, as dis-
30:1097:68442:18:18:56:555:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cussed inAmiti and Weinstein(2011) or   Chor and Manova(2012); inventory considerations
30:1098:68529:18:18:56:554:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discussed inAlessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan(2010b); input-output linkages and vertical
30:1099:68618:18:18:56:555:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specialization discussed inBems, Johnson, and Yi(2010); or shocks to the future value of man-
30:1100:68711:18:18:56:555:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ufactures as inEaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis(2013). Either (or all) of these mechanisms
30:1101:68803:18:24:56:551:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would complement our results and, perhaps, provide a complete account of the drop in trade.
30:1102:68894:24:18:57:554:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The distinguishing feature of our explanation relative to this literature is that our model does
30:1103:68990:18:18:56:570:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not rely on specifics about the 2008-2009 crisis. As Figure5(a)   shows, our model can account
30:1104:69084:18:18:56:555:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well for cyclical fluctuations in U.S. imports for 40 years of data. Moreover, our model’s ability
30:1105:69182:18:18:56:555:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to account for both the past 40 years and the most recent crisis is consistent with evidence
30:1106:69274:18:18:56:555:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regarding the sources of macroeconomic fluctuations.Stock and Watson(2012) use a dynamic
30:1107:69362:18:18:56:555:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor model to analyze the contributions of various shocks to explaining the most recent and
30:1108:69455:18:18:56:554:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:previous recessions. They find that the same factors that explained previous postwar recessions
30:1109:69550:18:0:56:257:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also explain the most recent recession.

31:1129:69839:29:18:57:555:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section examines some cross-sectional implications ofour model. Our model predicts that
31:1130:69931:18:18:56:555:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a country’s bilateral imports should be more volatile when sourced from a partner with longer
31:1131:70024:18:18:56:555:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shipping times. This implication is shown in the final column of Table5; the volatility of nomi-
31:1132:70120:18:17:56:555:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nal imports increases with the share1−φ(the effective length of time to ship) of imports that
31:1133:70213:17:18:56:555:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:arrive in the following period. This implication is a “test” of our model because the static model
31:1134:70311:18:18:56:555:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(or the dynamic model with no active intertemporal marginal rate of substitution) predicts that
31:1135:70406:18:25:56:439:269:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:the volatility of imports is independent of to the time-to-ship/distance.19
31:1136:70481:25:18:57:555:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To explore this implication, we construct a measure of the time it takes to ship goods from a
31:1137:70574:18:18:56:555:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country of origin into the US by combiningHummels and Schaur’s (  2013) dataset on shipping

34:1211:76113:28:18:57:554:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our paper shows how incorporating dynamic, forward-lookingfeatures into static interna-

34:1213:76295:18:18:56:555:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frequencies. The key premise is that international trade is a time-intensive activity, and, thus,
34:1214:76392:18:18:56:555:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variation in the rate at which agents are willing to substitute across time affects how trade vol-

34:1217:76678:18:18:56:555:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:business-cycle frequencies. Furthermore, we showed that our model can account well for both

34:1219:76855:24:18:57:554:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Several questions and avenues for future research remain open. While we presented evidence
34:1220:76945:18:18:56:555:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the volatility of trade by distance and mode, further analysis of this type may help to pro-

34:1222:77136:18:18:56:555:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:critical roles in formulating predictions and recommendations for policy makers. Because our
34:1223:77228:18:18:56:555:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model has both theoretical consistency and statistical performance, exploring the model’s abil-

39:1335:85031:18:18:85:554:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:tinction are the line numbers—specifically lines 7 and 11 for nominal values, quantity and

39:1338:85225:34:18:56:554:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As discussed in Section2.1  , the construction of real absorption and the associated price index is
39:1339:85324:18:18:56:555:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not as straightforward as this might seem. Real values in the U.S. NIPA accounts are chain-type
39:1340:85419:18:18:56:554:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indexes using an “ideal” chain index advocated byFisher(1922). While these indexes have
39:1341:85506:18:18:56:555:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desirable properties, they are not additive across categories (seeEhemann, Katz, and Moulton
39:1342:85598:18:18:56:555:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2002) andWhelan(2002) for detailed discussions). For our purposes, the implication is that
39:1343:85689:18:18:56:555:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one cannot compute real absorption simply by adding real goods GDP to real imports and
39:1344:85775:18:24:56:184:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subtracting real exports.
39:1345:85800:24:18:57:555:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our solution to this problem is to use a “Fisher of Fishers” approach suggested byDiewert
39:1346:85889:18:18:56:555:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1978). The basic idea is to take the quantities indexes and the associated price indexes for the
39:1347:85986:18:18:56:555:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:categories of interest and then compute Fisher indexes of these measures—hence the “Fisher of
39:1348:86079:18:18:56:555:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Fishers” name. For example, to construct real absorption and the associated price index, then
39:1349:86172:18:18:56:554:81:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the quantity indexes of goods GDP, (minus) goods exports, and goods imports and the price
39:1350:86261:18:0:56:432:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indexes are combined to create a Fisher quantity index and price index.

40:1352:86367:28:18:57:555:691:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section discusses how objects in our model relate to those in the data. The key issue re-
40:1353:86461:18:18:56:554:673:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gards adjusting observed time series given the timing friction to estimate the stochastic process
40:1354:86558:18:18:56:555:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for endowments and prices. Below, we discuss the one-period time-to-ship case and the inter-
40:1355:86650:18:24:56:194:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mediate time-to-ship case.

40:1357:86764:18:18:56:555:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:need to construct a time series to proxy forzt,pxt, andpyt. Specifically, we need the variables
40:1358:86859:18:18:56:555:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the data to reflect the timing at which they would be observed by the agent in the model,
40:1359:86951:18:18:56:555:559:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not the timing at which they are observed by U.S. statistical agencies. These agencies collect
40:1360:87045:18:18:56:555:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:import data and the prices on arrival at the border. Yet, in the model, these prices are observed
40:1361:87142:18:18:56:555:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a quarter before. Thus, we adjust the data variables accordingly to make them consistent with
40:1362:87235:18:18:56:555:505:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:B:the timing of our model. Below, we discuss the adjustment and measurement forpy,z, andpx
40:1363:87323:18:24:56:95:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in turn.
40:1364:87331:24:18:57:555:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To measurepyt, we used the observed price index of imports, but shifted one period back.
40:1365:87419:18:18:56:555:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Again, the reason is that is the price measured in Q1 2011 is really the price that the agent
40:1366:87512:18:18:56:555:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observed and on which he based his choice of imports in Q4 2010 according to our model.
40:1367:87599:18:18:56:554:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, by shifting back the Q1 2011 price of imports, it will line up in the estimation with Q4
40:1368:87693:18:24:56:307:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2010 real (adjusted) absorption and price index.
40:1369:87741:24:18:57:554:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The timing assumption affects absorption, as well. Absorption from NIPA includes consump-

40:1394:88384:18:18:56:555:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:B:zt, by using real GDP, minus real exports, plus real imports att+ 1, and the associated price

41:1437:89620:18:24:56:393:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Quantitatively, we found little difference in the two approaches.

41:1439:89772:18:18:56:555:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above. The only difference is that measured imports are now a combination of imports decided
41:1440:89864:18:18:56:555:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upon today and yesterday, thus, all import series and the associated price indexes are adjusted
41:1441:89959:18:32:56:193:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to reflect this. Specifically,

42:1453:90529:28:18:57:555:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we report two alternative parameterizations. The first one reproduces Table4
42:1454:90622:18:18:56:555:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but withθ=4. The second alternative parameterization reports results when the stochastic
42:1455:90710:18:18:56:555:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:process for endowments and prices are treated as independent AR(1) processes and estimated
42:1456:90800:18:25:56:112:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:separately.
42:1457:90811:25:18:57:554:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table9 presents the results withθ=4. The key observation is that both the income and price
42:1458:90901:18:18:56:555:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticities are significantly higher than in the baseline results. For example, withγ= 2, the in-
42:1459:90999:18:17:56:554:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:come elasticity is two—the same as theγ= 5, θ= 1.5case presented in Table4. Price elasticities
42:1460:91093:17:25:56:446:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are, higher, but they are significantly biased below the true price elasticity.
42:1461:91172:25:18:57:555:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table10  presents the results with a different stochastic process forendowments. We estimated
42:1462:91265:18:18:56:555:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:separate AR(1) processes for each series. Thus, there is no covariance at all between endow-
42:1463:91357:18:18:56:555:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments and prices. For the income elasticity, the results are effectively the same. For the price
42:1464:91453:18:18:56:554:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity, the results appear to be larger than those in Table4. The reason is evident in the dis-
42:1465:91552:18:18:56:554:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cussion at the end of Section3.1  about how different covariance structures can either reinforce
42:1466:91648:18:17:56:555:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the results or offset them. Here, it appears that the covariance structure estimated from the data
42:1467:91746:17:0:56:479:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:appears to reinforce the results specifically for the estimate of the price elasticity.
