2:27:1187:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Are there times when durable spending is less responsive to economic stimulus? We argue that aggregate
2:28:1289:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:durable expenditures respond more sluggishly to economic shocks during recessions because microeconomic
2:29:1392:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:frictions lead to declines in the frequency of households' durable adjustment. We show this by first
2:30:1492:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:using indirect inference to estimate a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model with fixed costs
2:31:1592:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:of durable adjustment to match consumption dynamics in PSID microdata. We then show that aggregating
2:32:1692:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:this model delivers an extremely procyclical Impulse Response Function (IRF) of durable spending
2:33:1788:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:to aggregate shocks.  For example, the response of durable spending to an income shock in 1999 is
2:34:1885:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:estimated to be almost twice as large as if it occurred in 2009. This procyclical IRF holds in response
2:35:1988:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:to standard business cycle shocks as well as in response to various policy shocks, and it is robust to
2:36:2090:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:general equilibrium. After estimating this robust theoretical implication of micro frictions, we provide
2:37:2194:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:additional direct empirical evidence for its importance using both cross-sectional patterns in PSID
2:38:2293:14:42:72:403:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:data as well as time-series patterns from aggregate durable spending.

3:50:2578:48:18:89:539:620:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Does the response of aggregate durable spending to a given change in policy depend on
3:51:2663:18:18:71:539:602:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the state of the business cycle? In this paper, we argue that microeconomic durable frictions
3:52:2756:18:26:71:331:584:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:lead to sluggish macro responses during recessions.
3:53:2807:26:324:193:418:558:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:Figure 1: Frequency of Durable Adjustment
3:54:2848:324:18:89:539:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We begin by using various data to show that while durable adjustment is always infre-
3:55:2933:18:18:71:539:216:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:quent, households are particularly unlikely to adjust their durable holdings during recessions.
3:56:3028:18:18:71:538:198:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 1 shows the frequency of durable adjustment in PSID data across time.1We show
3:57:3112:18:18:71:539:180:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:this both for a broad measure of durables, which is only available beginning with the PSID
3:58:3202:18:18:71:539:162:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:redesign in 1999, as well as for housing, which is available for a longer time-series.  Panel
3:59:3295:18:18:71:539:144:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:logit regressions imply that recessions lead to a decline in the probability of broad durable
3:60:3388:18:18:71:539:126:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment of approximately 20% and a decline in the probability of buying/selling a house
3:61:3478:18:16:85:540:108:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:1See Appendix 1 for a detailed description of the data construction for these and subsequentfigures.
3:62:3578:16:12:71:539:92:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Broad durables include both housing and vehicles while housing includes only housing adjustment.  Fre-
3:63:3680:12:0:71:159:80:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:quencies are annual.
4:64:3701:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of approximately 15%.2In addition to this time-series result, wefind a strong relationship
4:65:3791:18:18:71:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:between local business cycles and durable adjustment: a two-standard deviation increase
4:66:3878:18:18:71:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in state unemployment lowers the probability of broad durable adjustment in the PSID by
4:67:3965:18:18:71:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:30%-40% after controlling for various combinations of state, year and householdfixed effects.
4:68:4058:18:18:89:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Aggregate durable turnover shows a similar pattern:  Figure 2 shows various measures
4:69:4142:18:18:71:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of durable sales in a year divided by initial stocks.  Thefirst panel shows the behavior of
4:70:4233:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:new and used vehicle sales (as measured by CNW market research) and the second panel
4:71:4317:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shows the behavior of new and existing housing sales (as measured by Census and HUD).
4:72:4402:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:While it is well-known that new durable purchases are highly cyclical, it is less widely
4:73:4490:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:documented that used durables exhibit similar patterns. These facts reinforce each other so
4:74:4581:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that the probability that a randomly chosen house or car changes hands falls dramatically
4:75:4670:18:20:71:142:510:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:in recessions.3

4:77:4746:351:16:89:539:139:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:These microeconomic adjustment patterns have important implications for business cycle
4:78:4832:16:16:85:540:123:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2See Appendix 1 for formal regression results.  Declines during recessions are highly significant and hold
4:79:4938:16:8:71:231:107:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:using various detrending procedures.
4:80:4974:8:16:85:540:99:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:3New (New+Existing) house turnover is 19% (22%) lower in recession years than non-recession years.
4:81:5072:16:12:72:540:83:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Similarly, New (New+Existing) vehicle turnover is11% (14%) lower. See Appendix 1 for description of our
4:82:5175:12:0:72:94:71:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:data.
5:83:5181:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics.  In particular, infrequent and lumpy durable adjustment at the household level
5:84:5269:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:leads aggregate durable expenditures to become much less responsive to shocks or unantici-
5:85:5359:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:pated policy changes during recessions. Why is there a cyclical link between micro lumpiness
5:86:5451:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and aggregate responsiveness?  Declines in wealth and income during recessions lead fewer
5:87:5540:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households to adjust their durable holdings upwards and more households to adjust them
5:88:5626:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:downwards.  However, the presence of depreciation means that the number of increases
5:89:5710:18:18:72:540:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:declines more quickly than the number of decreases grows.  Thus, during recessions, fewer
5:90:5799:18:18:72:540:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households adjust their durable holdings, which sharply reduces the elasticity of aggregate
5:91:5890:18:18:72:286:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable expenditures to aggregate shocks.
5:92:5931:18:18:89:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Understanding the behavior of broad durable expenditures is crucial for understanding
5:93:6016:18:18:72:540:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:recessions.  Consumer durables and residential investment respectively accounted for 24%
5:94:6104:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and 33% of the total decline in real GDP between 2007-2009 so that declines in broad durable
5:95:6196:18:17:72:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:spending account for more than half of the recession.4From 1960-2013 both components of
5:96:6283:17:18:71:539:475:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:GDP were highly cyclical and volatile, with reductions in consumer durable spending (res-
5:97:6372:18:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:idential investment) accounting for 26.6% (58.3%) of real GDP changes during recessions.5
5:98:6461:18:18:72:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Leamer [2007] shows that residential investment and durable spending are the two most
5:99:6546:18:18:72:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:importance components in explaining "Weakness in GDP" going into recessions prior to
5:100:6630:18:18:72:540:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:2007-2009.  Thus, in a pure accounting sense, stabilizing broad durable expenditures would
5:101:6720:18:18:72:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:substantially moderate the business cycle, and indeed, a number of policy interventions
5:102:6807:18:18:72:504:367:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:during the Great Recession were specifically designed to stimulate durable demand.6
5:103:6890:18:18:89:539:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We argue for the quantitative and empirical relevance of procyclical durable responsive-
5:104:6978:18:18:71:160:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ness infive steps:
5:105:6996:18:18:89:540:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:1)  We use indirect inference to estimate a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets
5:106:7078:18:18:71:540:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model withfixed costs of durable adjustment to match household behavior in PSID.  In
5:107:7162:18:18:71:539:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:particular, we use a novel "gaps" based approach that maximizes thefit between model
5:108:7246:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and data along the dimensions which are most important for explaining durable adjustment.
5:109:7335:18:18:71:539:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:This procedure is extremely successful as our model is able to explain 72-86% of observed
5:110:7424:18:17:71:539:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:variation in household adjustment probabilities.  In addition, our estimated model matches
5:111:7514:17:18:71:314:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a variety of facts that are not directly targeted.
5:112:7564:18:18:93:539:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:2) After arguing that our estimated model matches micro consumption dynamics, we
5:113:7644:18:18:71:539:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:explore its implications for aggregate dynamics. We begin the macro analysis with a series of
5:114:7737:18:18:71:539:152:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate shocks in partial equilibrium. We start with a partial equilibrium analysis because
5:115:7830:18:16:85:539:134:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:4This is the change in components of real chained GDP divided by the change in total real chained GDP
5:116:7931:16:8:72:174:118:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:from 2007q4 to 2009q2.
5:117:7953:8:16:85:539:110:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:5This is the average contribution to percent change in real gross domestic product from BEA Table 1.1.2
5:118:8056:16:8:72:253:94:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:calculated over NBER recession quarters.
5:119:8096:8:0:85:407:86:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:6For example, the Cash for Clunkers and First Time Home Buyers credit.
6:120:8167:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:it allows us to explore a more empirically realistic baseline model and provide more sensitivity
6:121:8263:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:analysis relative to what is feasible in general equilibrium.  In addition, it allows us to
6:122:8354:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:explore the implications of business cycles for household dynamics in a model that perfectly
6:123:8446:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:replicates the aggregate behavior of income and wealth.  We show that the response of
6:124:8531:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate durable expenditures to a variety of shocks is highly procyclical. In particular, we
6:125:8625:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:allow for shocks to income, wealth, taxes, interest rates and subsidies to durable adjustment.
6:126:8719:18:18:72:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In all cases there is substantial state-dependence so that the same shock has much smaller
6:127:8809:18:18:72:435:582:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:effects if it occurs in a recession than if it occurs during an expansion.7
6:128:8884:18:18:89:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:3) As discussed above, the procyclical impulse response in our model is driven by variation
6:129:8975:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:across time in the distribution of households’ durable holdings together with the probability
6:130:9068:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:they adjust.  We next show that we can directly test for this reduced form implication in
6:131:9157:18:18:71:508:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:PSID data, and we show that the data strongly supports this theoretical implication.
6:132:9241:18:18:89:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:4) While steps 1-3 provide evidence for procyclical responsiveness in partial equilibrium,
6:133:9331:18:17:71:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a large literature argues that general equilibrium can undo these effects.  To assess this,
6:134:9422:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:we next add general equilibrium to our model and show that our conclusions are robust.8
6:135:9509:18:18:72:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:The key reason that GE is not particularly important in our framework is that households
6:136:9597:18:18:72:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:can save in both illiquid wealth and liquid wealth.  If households can only save in only one

6:138:9767:18:18:72:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:necessarily induces violations of consumption smoothing.  With two sources of savings so

6:140:9889:18:18:89:540:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:5)  Finally, we show that our GE RBC model withfixed costs of durable adjustment
6:141:9969:18:18:71:540:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is a substantially betterfit to time-series evidence than are existing models with durable
6:142:10059:18:18:71:539:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:consumption. We do a much better job of matching standard business cycle moments than
6:143:10144:18:18:71:540:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:models withflexible durable adjustment.  While models with convex adjustment costs can
6:144:10230:18:18:71:539:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:also match these standard business cycle moments, we also show that aggregate durable
6:145:10315:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:expenditures exhibit "conditional-heteroscedasticity": they are more volatile during booms
6:146:10405:18:18:71:539:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:than during recessions.  Conditional heteroscedasticity arises naturally in our model with
6:147:10495:18:17:71:452:223:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:B:fixed costs of adjustment but not in models with convex adjustment costs.
6:148:10568:17:18:89:539:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Thus, a variety of structural, reduced-form and time-series evidence supports the conclu-
6:149:10657:18:18:71:539:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sion that durable expenditures respond less strongly to shocks during recessions.  However,
6:150:10748:18:18:71:540:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:it is important to note that our results are about the relative effectiveness of durable stimulus
6:151:10845:18:18:71:539:152:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:over the business cycle, so they do not on their own imply that durable stimulus is ineffective
6:152:10940:18:18:71:539:134:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:during recessions. What they do imply is that policy makers will get less bang-for-the-buck
6:153:11031:18:12:85:453:116:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:7Importantly, our model implies a state-dependent IRF but not an asymmetric IRF.
6:154:11111:12:15:85:540:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:8One disadvantage of GE is that the set of permissible exogneous shocks is more limited.  For example,
6:155:11213:15:12:72:539:89:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:we can no longer introduce exogenous shocks to interestrates since these are determined endogenously. For
6:156:11318:12:0:72:333:77:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:this reason, we focus on TFP shocks in general equilibrium.
7:157:11378:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:from policies designed to stabilize durable expenditures during recessions than suggested by
7:158:11470:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:linear VAR evidence.  Indeed, in Berger and Vavra [2014] we provide evidence using non-
7:159:11557:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:linear VARs that durable spending multipliers are substantially lower during recessions than
7:160:11649:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:those implied by linear VARs.  In addition, Kaplan and Violante [2014] argue that poli-
7:161:11736:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:cies designed to stimulate non-durable spending are likely to become more effective during
7:162:11826:18:18:71:469:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:recessions, so such policies may be relatively more attractive for stabilization.
7:163:11907:18:18:89:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:For most of the paper, we focus on analyzing a broad measure of durable spending
7:164:11987:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that encompasses both consumer durables and housing.  We focus on this broad notion of
7:165:12073:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables since procyclical responsiveness should apply to any purchase which is long-lived
7:166:12163:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and illiquid. These are important characteristics at the broadest level of durable aggregation.
7:167:12258:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In addition, both consumer durable spending and residential investment are very large and
7:168:12347:18:18:71:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:have similar cyclical patterns.9Nevertheless, focusing on this broad notion of durables
7:169:12434:18:17:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:forces us to abstract from some institutional features that may be important for housing but
7:170:12526:17:18:71:539:475:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:not for autos (or vice versa).  For this reason, we consider several robustness checks that
7:171:12617:18:18:71:524:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:focus separately on different durable components and show that our conclusions remain.
7:172:12703:18:18:89:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:There is a long line of literature studying models with durable consumption.10In pio-
7:173:12788:18:18:72:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:neering work, Eberly [1994] estimates (S,s) triggers for household auto purchases based on
7:174:12878:18:18:72:540:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the stylized model of Grossman and Laroque [1990]. She then interacts these estimated trig-
7:175:12969:18:18:72:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gers with estimates of the household wealth distribution to explain the aggregate time-series
7:176:13062:18:18:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for U.S. auto purchases.  We expand on this approach in several important ways.  Since
7:177:13148:18:18:72:540:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:her work is based on Grossman and Laroque [1990] she imposes a single (S,s) trigger.  In
7:178:13236:18:18:72:540:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:addition, she must exclude liquidity constrained households from her analysis.  We show
7:179:13323:18:18:72:540:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that in our model, which allows for binding borrowing constraints as well as (S,s) triggers
7:180:13414:18:18:72:540:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that vary with income and wealth, these assumptions matter. In contrast to our model, the
7:181:13503:18:18:72:540:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Grossman and Laroque [1990] model has very little predictive power for most households’
7:182:13590:18:18:72:540:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable adjustment. In a similar stylized model, Bar-Ilan and Blinder [1992] argue that (S,s)
7:183:13683:18:18:72:539:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:models should lead durable spending to depend on the past history of durable purchases and
7:184:13773:18:17:72:324:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:thus the distribution of households’ current gaps.
7:185:13823:17:16:85:539:206:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:9It is important to note that the stock of housing is somewhat larger than the stock of consumer durables,
7:186:13929:16:12:72:540:190:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:but that this is due to slightly lower depreciation rates.  The average level of real consumer durable expen-
7:187:14038:12:8:72:402:178:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:diture is slightly larger than the average level of real residential investment.

7:190:14328:12:12:72:539:142:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of durable consumption withfixed costs.  Leahy and Zeira [2005], Luengo-Prado [2006], and Browning and

7:192:14533:12:12:72:540:118:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:a large body of work studying various aspects of durable consumption over the life-cycle including Dunn

8:194:14719:0:18:89:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Bajari, Chan, Krueger, and Miller [2013] usean alternative estimation procedure to try
8:195:14805:18:18:71:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to understand housing demand.   In contrast to our approach, they estimate a reduced
8:196:14889:18:18:71:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:form housing demand function and then back out utility parameters tofit these reduced
8:197:14974:18:18:71:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:form estimates rather than solving the households’ dynamic programming problem.  This
8:198:15059:18:18:71:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:approach makes the results less suitable for analyzing policy changes that might alter the
8:199:15149:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:reduced form relationship they estimate.  In addition, they only explore one-time shocks in
8:200:15240:18:18:71:474:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:partial equilibrium, in contrast to our emphasis on business cycle implications.
8:201:15320:18:18:89:540:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Iacoviello and Pavan [2013] build an incomplete markets model withfixed costs of housing
8:202:15408:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment and aggregate shocks. In contrast to our paper, they perform a simple calibration
8:203:15500:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:exercise for the parameters of the model and do not explore its ability to explain micro
8:204:15588:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics. In addition, they focus on entirely different aggregate questions. While our model
8:205:15680:18:18:71:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is infinite horizon, they instead build a life-cycle model, and computational considerations
8:206:15772:18:18:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:then require an annual rather than quarterly frequency.  As such, their model is less suited
8:207:15864:18:17:71:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for examining business cycle dynamics and they instead focus on explaining secular changes
8:208:15954:17:18:71:185:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in aggregate volatility.
8:209:15978:18:18:89:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Kaplan and Violante [2014] study the implications of illiquid wealth holdings such as
8:210:16063:18:18:71:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables for the behavior of non-durable consumption and show that they are able to explain
8:211:16154:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the response of non-durable consumption to one-timefiscal rebate payments.  In addition,
8:212:16242:18:18:71:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:they briefly show that illiquidity can potentially lead to state-dependent consumption dy-
8:213:16332:18:18:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:namics. We view our work as highly complementary to their own but it is distinct in several
8:214:16423:18:18:71:539:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ways. For the most part, we focus on the implications of illiquidity for durable expenditures
8:215:16516:18:18:71:539:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rather than for non-durable spending because durable spending is substantially more impor-
8:216:16606:18:18:71:539:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:tant for understanding business cycle behavior. Since our motivation is understanding how
8:217:16695:18:18:71:540:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:micro consumption dynamics influence aggregate business cycles, our model also features a
8:218:16784:18:18:71:494:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:variety of aggregate shocks and we explore the implications of general equilibrium.
8:219:16867:18:18:89:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, our paper is closely related to Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger [1995], Ca-

8:222:17127:18:17:71:540:205:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:vious difference that we study households rather thanfirms, there are several distinctions
8:223:17217:17:18:71:539:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:between our analyses.  In Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger [1995] and Caballero, Engel,
8:224:17305:18:18:71:539:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and Haltiwanger [1997] they impute capital and employment gaps and explore their aggre-
8:225:17392:18:18:71:539:152:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gate implications.  However, their imputed gaps are inconsistent with those arising under
8:226:17481:18:18:71:539:134:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:optimalfirm behavior.  For example, in Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger [1995] afirm’s
8:227:17568:18:18:71:540:116:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:imputed capital gap is the difference between its current capital and what it would choose in

8:229:17754:18:39:71:539:80:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model.  In contrast, our gap imputation is fully model consistent.  Bachmann, Caballero,

9:237:18308:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in an estimated, quantitative GE model.  The existing literature shows that ignoring micro

10:292:20706:18:18:71:539:473:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:B:fixing a broken furnace in a house.14When a household adjusts its durable stock, it must
10:293:20794:18:17:71:544:455:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:payfixed adjustment costs that take two forms.  First, they lose afixedfractionofthe
10:294:20878:17:18:71:539:438:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:value of their durable stock.   These costs correspond to brokers fees, titling costs, etc.
10:295:20969:18:18:71:539:420:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Second, households face some time cost of adjusting their durable holdings.  These costs
10:296:21057:18:18:71:539:402:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:correspond to, e.g., the time involved in searching for a new house or in researching which
10:297:21148:18:18:71:540:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:car to purchase. We allow for this general specification because these two adjustment costs
10:298:21239:18:18:71:540:366:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:may interact differently with the business cycle. The opportunity cost of time is procyclical
10:299:21332:18:18:71:539:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:so that time costs will tend to generate countercyclical durable adjustment.  Conversely,
10:300:21421:18:18:71:540:330:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:B:fixed costs that are proportional to the stockof durables have the most bite when income is
10:301:21512:18:18:71:539:312:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:low and tend to generate procyclical durable adjustment.  Estimating a specification with

10:303:21664:18:18:89:510:276:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Given these assumptions, the infinite horizon problem can be recast recursively as

10:305:21854:15:12:72:543:243:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Note the Cobb-Douglas utility function also means we can normalize the serviceflowsfromdurablestobe

10:307:21999:8:12:81:459:223:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:13Endogenizing hours complicates the model and does not affect our main conclusions.
10:308:22083:12:16:81:539:211:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:14In previous versions of this paper, we considered an adjustment cost function that allowed households
10:309:22186:16:12:72:540:195:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:to endogenously choose the amount of maintenance between0and1without paying thefixed adjustment
10:310:22281:12:12:72:540:183:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:cost.  This led to similar results but substantially increases the computational burden of the model, which
10:311:22388:12:0:72:194:171:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:makes estimation infeasible.

12:361:24146:18:18:89:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In the general formulation of our model, durables serve a dual role: they provide direct
12:362:24234:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:utility to households, but they also serve as collateral against which households can borrow.
12:363:24327:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:For most of the analysis that follows, we will shut down this second channel by setting=1.
12:364:24418:18:18:71:540:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:However, in Appendix 4 we estimate a version of the model with=020so that households
12:365:24504:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:need only pay a 20% down payment to purchasenew durable holdings.  We show that this
12:366:24588:18:18:71:526:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:version of the model delivers similar results both for micro and macro durable dynamics.
12:367:24676:18:18:89:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:There are two main reasons that we choose to make the model with=1our benchmark:
12:368:24757:18:18:71:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:First, when1and there is no adjustment costs on, the model implies that households
12:369:24842:18:18:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:can costlessly adjust their durable equity.  In other words, such a parameterization implies
12:370:24934:18:17:71:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that households can costlessly refinance, which is clearly counterfactual.  Since it is infeasi-
12:371:25030:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ble to solve a more realistic model with liquid assets, semi-liquid durable equity, and illiquid
12:372:25126:18:18:71:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables we concentrate on the case with no refinancing rather than the case with costless
12:373:25216:18:18:71:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:refinancing as our benchmark. Second, if collateral constraints become looser during expan-
12:374:25307:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sions this will tend to amplify all of our results since when down-payment requirements are
12:375:25398:18:18:71:539:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:low households can rapidly adjust their durable holdings in response to shocks. In contrast,
12:376:25490:18:18:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:when down-payment requirements are large, households must save a larger amount of liquid
12:377:25578:18:18:71:539:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:assets before increasing their durable holdings. By shutting this channel down, our quanti-
12:378:25669:18:18:71:539:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:tative conclusions are thus relatively conservative.  Setting=1in our benchmark model
12:379:25755:18:18:71:539:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:alsomakesourresultsmorecomparabletothemodel in Kaplan and Violante [2014], which
12:380:25835:18:18:71:358:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rules out collateralized borrowing against illiquid assets.
12:381:25894:18:18:89:539:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to exploring the role of collateral constraints, Appendix 4 also explores a
12:382:25981:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:second important empirical extension of our model.  In particular, we consider the role
12:383:26068:18:18:71:539:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of rental markets for our analysis and provide evidence that introducing rental markets
12:384:26155:18:18:71:540:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:has little quantitative effect on our results.   While rental markets are not particularly
12:385:26245:18:17:71:539:205:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:important for consumer durables, they play a large role in housing markets.   It would
12:386:26331:17:18:71:539:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:be desirable to build a model with separate consumer durables and housing, but this is
12:387:26417:18:18:71:539:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:technically infeasible. We disallow rental markets in our benchmark model for three reasons:
12:388:26509:18:16:81:539:152:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:15Since the tax isfixed across time, and hours are exogenous this plays essentially no role in our analysis.
12:389:26617:16:12:72:540:136:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Using a higher value to match overall income taxes (orexcluding taxes from the model entirely) yields
12:390:26718:12:12:72:540:124:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:nearly identical results along all dimensions.  We only include the tax so that we can perform simple policy
12:391:26826:12:8:72:426:112:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:experiments with temporary and permanent tax changes in the following section.
12:392:26904:8:16:81:539:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:16We have solved versions of the model with both higher and lower depreciation rates and arrived at similar
12:393:27011:16:0:72:124:88:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:conclusions.
13:394:27025:0:18:72:539:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:1) Consumer durable spending represents morethan half of total broad durable spending
13:395:27110:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:from 1960-2013, and rental markets are not important for consumer durables. 2) Introducing
13:396:27200:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rental markets increases the computational burden of the problem substantially by adding
13:397:27288:18:18:72:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:an additional choice.173)  The indirect inference procedure we describe next is based
13:398:27373:18:18:71:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:on the "gap" between a households’ current durable holdings and those it would hold if it
13:399:27462:18:18:71:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:temporarily faced no adjustment costs.  Defining gaps in a world with rental markets is
13:400:27549:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:not straightforward.18Focusing on a benchmark model without rentals and restricting the
13:401:27636:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:empirical analysis to homeowners obviates all of these issues.  Nevertheless, Appendix 4
13:402:27724:18:35:71:473:564:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:shows that the introduction of rental markets does not alter our conclusions.19

13:415:28753:18:18:71:539:307:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:today. However, since the household does face adjustment costs, its actual choice of durables
13:416:28846:18:18:71:540:289:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:today may or may not be equal to∗.Ifthen the household will choose

13:420:29180:18:18:71:539:217:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:will be increasing in the (absolute) size of the gap.  This implies that measuring household
13:421:29272:18:18:71:465:199:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gaps is essential for understanding households’ durable adjustment decisions.

13:425:29591:12:15:81:539:133:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:18In the data it is also not obvious how to define durable stocks for households that simultaneously rent

13:427:29729:9:15:81:540:109:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:19In addition, homeownership rates are fairly stableacross time with only mild procyclicality.  Further-

14:461:31594:18:18:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:That is, we would pick our parameters so that the simulated distribution of gaps and hazards

14:463:31773:18:18:72:540:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:be straightforward. The obvious complication with implementing this procedure is that we
14:464:31861:18:18:72:431:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:do not observein the data, so we cannot compute()and().
14:465:31923:18:18:89:539:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:While we do not directly observein the data, this procedure is not hopeless because
14:466:32007:18:18:71:540:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we can imputeusing restrictions implied by our structural model.22We know that in our
14:467:32093:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model, there is a mapping from observables to∗and thus. That is, for a particular set of
14:468:32183:18:18:71:540:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:parameters, we can construct a model-generated functionthat maps variableswhich

14:476:32509:18:18:71:539:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to overcome a methodological challenge by imputing unobservable empirical objects from
14:477:32595:18:16:81:540:152:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:20This intuitive expression ignores maintenance expenditures, but quantitatively in the simulated model
14:478:32698:16:12:71:540:136:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:these are close to constant across time so that this intuitive expression is highly accurate for capturing
14:479:32804:12:8:71:267:124:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:changes in durable expenditures numerically.
14:480:32848:8:12:81:377:116:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:21We have a more formal discussion of identification in Appendix 3.
14:481:32915:12:16:81:539:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:22This is analogous to the procedure in Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger [1995] and Caballero, Engel, and
14:482:33021:16:11:72:540:88:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Haltiwanger [1997], but in those papers they impute gaps using some simple rules of thumb that approximate

15:489:33554:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model gaps.23In addition, we require panel data on these objects so that we can construct

15:491:33730:18:18:72:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the only data sets satisfying this restriction are the PSID24(from 1999-2011), and the Italian

15:494:33998:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:formally stating our estimation procedure because it introduces two additional complications:
15:495:34091:18:18:71:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:1) PSID data is self-reported and subject to substantial measurement error.  2) Beginning
15:496:34180:18:18:71:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with the sample redesign, PSID only collects data every other year while our model period is
15:497:34272:18:17:71:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:quarterly.  We address both of these complications directly by aggregating our model data
15:498:34361:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to the same frequency as the PSID and introducing measurement error when comparing our

16:581:36524:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:time-aggregation bias, it will in general be a misspecified description of the dynamics of
16:582:36614:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the true model.  However, it is important to note that as usual in indirect inference, con-
16:583:36705:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sistent estimation does not require the auxiliary model to be correctly specified.  As long
16:584:36796:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:as the reduced form model is computed identically on actual and simulated data we will
16:585:36882:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:achieve consistent estimation.  We further discuss this point in addition to a discussion of
16:586:36974:18:18:71:367:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:identification of our structural parameters in Appendix 3.
16:587:37032:18:18:89:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Now that we have formally stated our estimation procedure, we provide some additional
16:588:37117:18:18:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:discussion in intuitive terms before turning to results.   It is important to note that since
16:589:37210:18:17:71:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the distribution of gaps in the model as well as in the data are purely functions of the joint
16:590:37304:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:distribution of observables,b, our estimation strategy is in some sense trying to make these
16:591:37397:18:18:71:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:joint distributions line up with each other.  If the joint distribution of observables in the
16:592:37490:18:18:71:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:modelΓ(c)was able to perfectly match the joint distribution of observables in the data
16:593:37578:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f16:145:g_d0_f2:B:Γ(b), then by construction the distribution of gaps in the model and data would be identical.
16:594:37672:18:18:89:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:However, given that we have few parameters and thatΓ(b)is an extremely high dimen-
16:595:37756:18:18:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sional object, a perfectfit is clearly unobtainable.26Since it is infeasible to perfectly match
16:596:37851:18:18:71:539:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the joint-distribution of wealth, durable holdings and non-durable consumption, which mo-
16:597:37940:18:18:71:539:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ments of this distribution are most important to match?  Our gap-based indirect inference
16:598:38029:18:18:71:539:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:procedure provides the answer to this question.  We should weight moments ofΓ(b)by
16:599:38113:18:18:71:539:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:their importance for determining gaps.  For example, if our model told us that the ratio
16:600:38201:18:18:71:539:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of non-durable to durable consumption was extremely important for determining household
16:601:38288:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gaps, while liquid wealth was unimportant, then our estimation strategy would place more
16:602:38376:18:18:71:497:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:weight on matching the former distribution and less weight on matching the latter.
16:603:38458:18:17:89:539:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In the following section, we will show that our bestfit parameters yield a distribution of
16:604:38548:17:18:71:539:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gaps in the model that is an extremely goodfit to the distribution in the data, which means
16:605:38639:18:19:71:539:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we match the moments ofΓ(b)that are important for determining gaps.27More importantly,

17:656:40989:25:18:71:539:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Here we briefly describe the data and sample restrictions for our benchmark estimation. We

17:658:41169:18:18:71:539:320:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:estimation uses data from the PSID from 1999-2011. Households are interviewed every other
17:659:41258:18:18:71:539:302:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:year, and are asked a variety of questions about non-durable consumption, wealth, housing,
17:660:41348:18:18:71:539:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:vehicles and income. While it would be desirable to extend the analysis to data before 1999,
17:661:41440:18:18:71:540:266:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the previous PSID samples only collected foodconsumption rather than broad non-durable
17:662:41526:18:18:71:508:248:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:consumption.  In addition, vehicle data was not constructed consistently across time.
17:663:41611:18:18:89:539:230:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:The value ofis the sum of all components of food consumption, utilities, transportation

17:665:41786:18:18:71:540:194:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and vehicle values andis the sum of business value, stocks, IRAs, cash and bonds minus the
17:666:41877:18:17:71:539:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:value of outstanding debt. Since our benchmark model does not include rental markets, we
17:667:41965:17:18:71:539:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:restrict our estimation to continuous home-owners in our benchmark results. In Appendix 4
17:668:42054:18:18:71:539:141:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss an extension of our model to include rental markets and adjust our PSID analysis

18:681:42930:18:18:72:539:517:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:typically used in the literature.29In the following sections, we show that thisfixed cost has
18:682:43023:18:17:71:539:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:important implications for aggregate dynamics.  In contrast, we estimate a negligible (and
18:683:43113:17:18:71:539:482:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:statistically insignificant) time cost of durable adjustment.  While not directly targeted, we
18:684:43207:18:18:71:539:464:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:show that the non-durable share in utility of 0.88 delivers ratios of durable to non-durable
18:685:43299:18:18:71:539:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:expenditures that are consistent with the data.  The point estimate for our measurement
18:686:43386:18:18:71:539:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:error parameter implies that measurement error is distributed mean zero with standard
18:687:43471:18:18:71:539:410:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:deviation of 8%.  This implies that a reported value will be within 5% (10%, 15%) of the
18:688:43559:18:18:71:539:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:true value approximately 47% (80%, 94%) of the time. Finally, our estimated maintenance
18:689:43646:18:43:71:463:374:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:parameter implies that households offset 80% of depreciation each quarter.30

19:708:44936:18:18:71:540:671:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:points. Again, this closefit between model and data means that for our bestfit parameters
19:709:45025:18:18:71:540:653:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the model is able to matchΓ(b)along the dimensions important for explaining gaps.  In
19:710:45112:18:18:71:539:635:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:addition, the estimated densities are moderately negatively skewed due to the presence of
19:711:45201:18:26:71:515:617:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:depreciation, which we will show has important implications for aggregate dynamics.31

19:714:45420:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is equal to the probability that a household adjusts for a given gapcNote that the hazard
19:715:45512:18:18:71:539:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in the model does not follow a strict (S,s) rule, jumping from 0 to 1 at some threshold. This
19:716:45605:18:18:71:540:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is because different state variables can map to the same gap so that sometimes a household
19:717:45695:18:18:71:539:205:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with a given gap will choose to adjust and other times it will not.32In the data, the hazard
19:718:45787:18:18:71:540:187:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is equal to the actual empirical probability that a household with an imputed gapbchooses
19:719:45878:18:18:71:539:169:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to adjust.  As stressed in the previous section, this is a very strong test of whether the
19:720:45968:18:14:71:539:151:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:structural model is well-specified.  If the model is very misspecified then the imputed gaps
19:721:46060:14:22:74:424:137:145:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f2:B:bwill have little predictive power for empirical durable adjustment.

19:723:46191:11:16:81:539:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:32Note that if we conditioned on all state variables rather than just the gap, households would follow a
19:724:46295:16:0:72:141:88:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:strict (S,s) rule.

20:726:46367:317:18:89:539:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, our model is extremely successful at predicting actual durable adjustment in
20:727:46452:18:18:71:540:374:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the data.33We can assess this more formally using several quantitative measures of thefit
20:728:46541:18:17:71:539:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:between the model and hazard.  First, we can compare the additional explanatory power
20:729:46626:17:21:71:539:339:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of our model versus a Calvo model that just implies all households adjust with the same
20:730:46713:21:0:71:296:318:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f13:B:probability.  That is, we compute2=1−

20:736:46803:0:18:408:539:318:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:.  This tells us how much
20:737:46828:18:18:72:540:300:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of the total variation in the hazard predicted by the model is observed in the empirical

20:740:47088:18:17:71:539:246:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the model over the whole distribution of gaps, but we might also be interested in a local

20:748:47360:18:18:71:540:193:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:percentage deviation between the model and empirical hazards.  Wefind that the average
20:749:47446:18:16:81:539:175:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:33Clearly the standard errors for the empirical hazard are wider than those for the model but the hazard
20:750:47550:16:12:72:540:159:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:is strongly upward sloping.  Wider standard errors inthe data occur because there is some idiosyncratic
20:751:47653:12:12:72:540:147:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:adjustment in the data not explained by our model andthis "noise" interacts with sampling error in regions
20:752:47759:12:8:72:244:135:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of the gap distribution with little mass.
20:753:47800:8:16:81:539:127:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:34We weight the deviations between(b)and(b)by(b)to account for the fact that more gap
20:754:47894:16:12:71:539:111:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:mass is close to zero than far out in the tails.  That means that we should care more about getting the
20:755:47997:12:12:71:539:99:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:hazard correct in the middle of the distribution.  If we weight all points in the hazard equally rather than
20:756:48105:12:0:71:314:87:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f17:F:weighting by the gap density then we get an2=098
21:757:48158:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:deviation is .276 so that given a gap, we can onaverage explain 72% of the observed hazard
21:758:48248:18:18:72:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in the data.35Thus, while our model is not a perfectfit to the empirical hazard, we can
21:759:48335:18:18:72:417:672:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:explain a very large fraction of observed adjustment probabilities.36
21:760:48404:18:18:89:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:It is important to note that since we only havefive parameters, there was no guarantee
21:761:48490:18:18:71:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that any configuration of parameters would be successful at matching the reduced form
21:762:48575:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:hazard and density of gaps.  In this sense, the predictive power of our model is not driven
21:763:48666:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:mechanically by imputing empirical gaps from our model structure.  In Appendix 3, we
21:764:48750:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:show this more explicitly by performing an identical estimation procedure using the model
21:765:48839:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of Grossman and Laroque [1990], which has served as the basis for many existing empirical
21:766:48928:18:18:71:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:studies. We show there that the empirical hazard computed from imputed gaps is nearlyflat,
21:767:49018:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and is, if anything downward sloping.  This implies that the model actually has modestly
21:768:49106:18:18:71:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:negative predictive power: when the model predicts that households in the data should be
21:769:49194:18:18:71:531:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:more likely to adjust than average, they are empirically less likely to adjust than average.
21:770:49286:18:17:89:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Thus, we view the strong ability of our benchmark model to predict empirical adjustment
21:771:49373:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:patterns as its main strength: while the structure used to impute gaps is complicated, given
21:772:49465:18:18:71:495:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:our imputed gap we are highly accurate at predicting when households will adjust.
21:773:49546:18:18:89:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the hazard and density, which are explicitly targeted by our indirect
21:774:49630:18:18:71:544:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:inference estimation procedure, we can also assess the modelfitalongvariousdimensions
21:775:49715:18:18:71:539:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:which are not directly targeted.  Kaplan and Violante [2014] emphasize the importance of
21:776:49803:18:18:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:"wealthy-hand-to-mouth" consumers for explaining household consumption dynamics. They
21:777:49888:18:18:71:539:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:argue that many households have a large fraction of their wealth in illiquid assets such as
21:778:49979:18:18:71:540:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables and that these households may behave quite differently from those with access
21:779:50065:18:18:71:539:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to liquid wealth.   Thus, if we want to take seriously the implications of our model for
21:780:50153:18:18:71:539:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:consumption dynamics, it is important that it implies reasonable numbers of both hand-
21:781:50239:18:18:71:540:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to-mouth and wealthy-hand-to-mouth households.  We define a hand-to-mouth household
21:782:50322:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:as one who has liquid assets less than one-half of their monthly labor earnings, and we
21:783:50409:18:18:71:540:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:then define a hand-to-mouth household as wealthy-hand-to-mouth if its durable holdings

21:785:50582:17:18:71:540:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:definition in PSID data, 28.7% of households are hand-to-mouth and 17.8% of households
21:786:50668:18:16:81:539:188:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:35The average absolute difference (rather than percentage difference) between the model and empirical
21:787:50769:16:12:72:540:172:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:hazard is .038.  In addition, as noted in the previous footnote, we weight deviations by the density of gaps.
21:788:50878:12:12:72:540:160:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:If we instead weight all points on the hazard equallythen we explain 86% of the observed hazard in the data
21:789:50985:12:8:72:239:148:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:andfind an absolute deviation of .032.
21:790:51023:8:16:81:539:140:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:36We do not model life-cycle interactions or shocks to locational preferences that might interact with
21:791:51125:16:12:72:540:124:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:housing decisions. We suspect that the unexplained portion of durable adjustment is largely driven by these
21:792:51232:12:8:72:361:112:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:factors, which should be largely independent of the business cycle.
21:793:51299:8:16:81:539:104:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:37Using different definitions such as 1/4 of monthly earnings for hand-to-mouth or the 50th percentile for
21:794:51405:16:0:72:348:88:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:durable holdings produces similarfits between model and data.
22:795:51468:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:are wealthy-hand-to-mouth. While the estimation does not directly target these numbers it
22:796:51557:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:produces extremely similar results, with 26.4% of households hand-to-mouth and 18.0% of
22:797:51644:18:18:72:254:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households wealthy-hand-to-mouth.
22:798:51677:18:18:89:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, our model produces an average frequency of adjustment which is close to that
22:799:51766:18:18:72:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in PSID data.  Using our broad definition of durables that encompasses housing+vehicles,
22:800:51854:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable stocks in the PSID data have an annual frequency of adjustment of 10.8%.  The
22:801:51939:18:26:72:468:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model implies a frequency of adjustment of only slightly above this at 12.9%.

22:803:52060:352:18:89:539:222:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we can assess the model’s ability to match the overall patterns of durable holdings
22:804:52152:18:18:71:547:204:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in the data. In Figure 5 we show four different slices of the durable distribution inΓ(b).We
22:805:52245:18:18:71:540:186:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:show the unconditional distribution of durable holdings as well as the relationship between
22:806:52336:18:18:71:539:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable holdings and non-durable consumption, the relationship between durable holdings
22:807:52423:18:18:71:539:150:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and total wealth, and the relationship between durable holdings and income.  Overall, the
22:808:52512:18:18:71:539:132:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model is a goodfit to the data.  The only place where the model misses somewhat more
22:809:52596:18:18:71:539:114:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:substantially is on the mean level of durable holdings.  While the distribution of durable
22:810:52686:18:18:71:539:96:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:holdings around the mean in the model and data are quite similar, the model overstates mean
22:811:52777:18:0:71:539:78:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable holdings relative to the data by roughly 10%. However, this does not have important
23:812:52870:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:consequences for any of our results. We can refit a version of the model that explicitly targets
23:813:52966:18:18:71:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:mean durable holdings to be equal in the model and data. By construction, this model is a
23:814:53055:18:18:71:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:slightly worsefit for the distribution of gaps and hazards but gives almost identical aggregate
23:815:53150:18:18:71:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:results. Again, the fact that our benchmark estimation does not exactly match mean durable
23:816:53240:18:18:71:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:holdings in the data implies that mean durable holdings are not particularly important for
23:817:53330:18:18:71:334:618:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:determining the distribution of gaps and hazards.38
23:818:53381:18:18:89:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Overall our estimated model is a goodfit to household level consumption dynamics both
23:819:53466:18:18:71:540:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:along targeted as well as untargeted dimensions. Bolstered by this good microeconomicfit,
23:820:53555:18:45:71:360:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we now explore the aggregate implications of our model.
23:821:53610:45:30:72:540:519:301:g_d0_f1:301:g_d0_f1:F:3  Aggregate Implications of Lumpy Durable Purchases
23:822:53662:30:18:72:540:489:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:We explore the macroeconomic implications of our model byfirst exploring the response
23:823:53747:18:18:71:539:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to a number of shocks in partial equilibrium.  The use of partial equilibrium analysis has
23:824:53837:18:18:71:539:453:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:several advantages: 1) Partial equilibrium is substantially faster to compute than general
23:825:53927:18:18:71:539:435:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium, which allows us to explore the robustness of our results to various extensions such
23:826:54023:18:18:71:539:417:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:as collateralized borrowing and rental markets and to perform additional sensitivity analysis.
23:827:54117:18:17:71:539:399:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:2) In partial equilibrium we can explore a number of aggregate shocks (such as exogenous
23:828:54205:17:18:71:539:382:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:changes in interest rates) that are more challenging to model in general equilibrium.  We
23:829:54294:18:18:71:539:364:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:will argue that lumpy micro adjustment has important implications for how actual durable
23:830:54382:18:18:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:spending responds to any shock that changes desired durable holdings, so it is important to
23:831:54473:18:18:71:540:328:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:explore robustness to a variety of shocks.393) In partial equilibrium, we can pick a sequence
23:832:54566:18:18:71:539:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of aggregate income and wealth shocks that exactly reproduces the behavior of U.S. GDP
23:833:54652:18:18:71:539:292:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:and capital across time so that our simulated economy well-approximates the actual U.S.
23:834:54739:18:39:71:117:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:economy.
23:835:54747:39:26:72:290:235:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:3.1  Aggregate Income Shocks
23:836:54775:26:18:72:540:209:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:We begin by exploring the implications of aggregate income shocks.  For brevity, we leave
23:837:54864:18:17:72:540:191:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the full model description to Appendix 2 and just discuss the changes in the model relative
23:838:54955:17:18:72:540:174:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f5:B:to the previous section.   In the previous section, we assumed thatlog0=log+
23:839:55036:18:19:72:539:156:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with∼(0)whereis an idiosyncratic income shock.   We introduce aggregate
23:840:55113:19:16:81:539:137:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:38This makes sense since as average durable holdings rise both−1and∗will tend to rise and gaps are
23:841:55213:16:12:72:540:121:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:not that affected. Furthermore, time-series movements in aggregate durable expenditures also don’t depend
23:842:55318:12:8:72:499:109:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:much on mean durable holdings since they are determined by changes inrather than levels of.
23:843:55411:8:16:81:539:101:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:39Since our mechanism applies in a wide-variety of environments and in response to a variety of shocks, we
23:844:55517:16:12:72:540:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:prefer to focus on documenting the generality of our mechanism rather than taking a stand on a particular
23:845:55622:12:0:72:516:73:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:source of business cycle shocks or focusing on the institutional details of one particular policy change.

24:847:55819:18:36:71:311:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:component plus an additional aggregate shock:

24:849:55882:26:18:89:544:628:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:As before, we assume that the idiosyncratic component of income,log,followsanAR

24:853:56220:18:18:72:540:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:one additional aggregate state-variable to the household’s problem but solution methods are
24:854:56311:18:18:72:540:538:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:otherwise unchanged.  We solve this model using the parameters previously estimated and
24:855:56398:18:18:72:364:520:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:then compute impulse response functions tologshocks.
24:856:56451:18:18:89:540:502:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Motivated by the evidence in Figure 1, we are particularly interested in whether micro
24:857:56537:18:18:72:539:484:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:non-linearities in durable adjustment lead durable spending to respond differently to income
24:858:56629:18:17:72:540:466:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shocks which occur at different points in the business cycle.   To do this, we mustfirst
24:859:56717:17:18:71:540:449:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:define booms and recessions in our model.  We match our model to U.S. data by picking
24:860:56802:18:18:71:539:431:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a particular sequence of aggregate income shocks in the modellog19601 log20134to
24:861:56891:18:18:72:540:413:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:exactly reproduce hpfiltered US GDP from 1960-2013.  Given this sequence of shocks, we
24:862:56977:18:18:72:539:395:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:can then compute the impulse response of durable expenditures to anadditionalimpulse to
24:863:57064:18:18:72:540:377:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate income at each date. That is, we feed a sequence of aggregate shocks exogenously
24:864:57154:18:18:72:540:359:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:into our model for 212 quarters.  Then given the history of aggregate shocks up to each
24:865:57241:18:18:72:540:341:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:date, we compute the full impulse response function to an additional shock at that date.
24:866:57329:18:18:72:493:323:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:See Appendix 2 for additional discussion of the computation of impulse responses.
24:867:57410:18:18:89:539:305:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We summarize our state-dependent impulse response in three ways.  First, following
24:868:57492:18:18:72:539:287:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Bachmann, Caballero, and Engel [2013], we compute thefirst element of the impulse response
24:869:57582:18:18:71:540:269:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:function (IRF) for each quarter between 1960q1 and 2013q4.  This "Responsiveness Index"
24:870:57669:18:18:71:539:251:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:provides an estimate of how much durable expenditures will respond to an aggregate shock
24:871:57757:18:18:71:539:233:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to income in the quarter in which it occurs.  We are particularly interested in the IRF on
24:872:57847:18:18:71:539:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:impact since this has direct relevance for how durable expenditures are likely to respond
24:873:57936:18:17:71:539:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in the short-run to shocks or stimulus policies during recessions.  Second, we report the
24:874:58025:17:18:71:539:180:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:cumulative response41of durable expenditures to the same impulse to income.  Figure 6
24:875:58110:18:18:72:540:162:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shows that measured either using either method, durable expenditures are substantially less
24:876:58201:18:18:72:318:144:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:responsive to income shocks during recessions.42
24:877:58249:18:12:81:454:126:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:40Calibrating the income shocks to labor compensation yields nearly identical results.
24:878:58335:12:16:81:539:114:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:41The cumulative response is the total area under the impulse response function from 1-8 quarters (after
24:879:58439:16:8:72:283:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:which the IRFs are indistinguishable from zero).
24:880:58487:8:16:81:540:90:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:42As we will show more formally when discussing whatdrives this result, this is evidence of an impulse
24:881:58589:16:0:71:540:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:response that depends on the state of the business cycle, it is not evidence of an asymmetric response to

25:883:58763:335:18:89:539:374:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:On average, the IRF on impact in recessions is only 54% of that in expansions, indicating
25:884:58852:18:18:71:540:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:an economically significant amount of state-dependence.   Table 2 shows that the 95th
25:885:58937:18:18:71:539:338:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:percentile of the IRF on impact is 174% larger than the 5th percentile and that the 95th
25:886:59025:18:27:71:433:320:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:percentile of the cumulative IRF is 46% larger than the 5th percentile.

26:909:59913:44:18:89:539:288:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 8 shows that the IRF on impact in 1999 is estimated to be almost twice as large
26:910:59999:18:17:71:539:270:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:as that in 2009.  While the IRF on impact is most relevant for assessing the short-run
26:911:60085:17:18:71:539:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:impact of economic shocks during recessions, these differences persist for several quarters:
26:912:60177:18:18:71:436:235:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the cumulative IRF in 1999 is more than 30% larger than that in 2009.
26:913:60246:18:18:89:539:217:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Before turning to an explanation for this procyclical durable spending IRF, we show that
26:914:60334:18:18:71:539:199:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the same result holds for a variety of other aggregate shocks. Beyond just providing a simple
26:915:60427:18:18:71:539:181:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:robustness check, this is important because we want to argue that the aggregate implications
26:916:60519:18:18:71:539:163:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of lumpy micro adjustment apply to a wide-class of aggregate shocks. Essentially all shocks
26:917:60610:18:18:71:465:145:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that are commonly used to explain business cycles yield similar implications.
26:918:60687:18:0:81:320:127:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:43Other boom and recession years yield similar results.

27:920:60772:26:18:72:540:682:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:While we consider income shocks to be the most natural proxy for U.S. business cycles in a
27:921:60862:18:18:72:540:664:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:partial equilibrium model, we next show that wealth shocks deliver similar results. We think
27:922:60954:18:18:72:540:646:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of these shocks as proxying for declines in stock market value or other asset holdings during
27:923:61047:18:18:72:539:628:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:recessions which will affect households’ consumption decisions. We assume that households’
27:924:61137:18:18:71:539:610:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:liquid wealth is subject to aggregate shocks which follow some AR process in logs.  That

27:927:61394:18:18:71:539:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we construct using a perpetual inventory method as in Bachmann, Caballero, and Engel
27:928:61478:18:17:71:539:538:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:[2013]. This yields a quarterly persistence of 0.95 and a standard deviation of 0.003 so that
27:929:61571:17:27:71:358:521:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate wealth shocks are small but highly persistent.

27:931:61682:334:18:89:539:160:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 9 shows that the durable response to wealth shocks is even more procyclical than
27:932:61769:18:18:71:539:142:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the response to income shocks.44Table II shows that the 95th percentile of the IRF on
27:933:61854:18:18:71:539:124:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:impact is more than 6 times as large as the 5th percentile.  The 95th percentile of the
27:934:61941:18:16:81:539:106:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:44Note that the model business cycles in the two versions of the model are not identical, since in one
27:935:62043:16:12:72:539:90:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:aggregate income exactly matches U.S. GDP, in the other aggregate wealth exactly matches U.S. capital.
27:936:62145:12:0:72:493:78:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Solving a model with both shocks simultaneously would be much more computationally difficult.
28:937:62240:0:18:72:409:708:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:cumulative IRF is almost 5 times larger than the 5th percentile.45
28:938:62306:18:18:89:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Our baseline wealth shock is a proportionate equal decline in all households wealth so
28:939:62392:18:18:71:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that all households face the same shock. However, rich households have a greater proportion
28:940:62483:18:18:71:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of their total wealth in liquid assets and so are more affected by these shocks. Nevertheless,
28:941:62577:18:18:71:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:this proportional shock may still understate distributional effects of wealth shocks if rich
28:942:62669:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households hold assets which are riskier and lose more value during recessions.  To assess
28:943:62759:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the importance of this channel, we have resolved a version of the model with wealth shocks
28:944:62849:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that only affect wealthy households as well as with wealth shocks that are increasing in the
28:945:62941:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:level of household wealth.  For brevity we do not plot the results but note that all of our
28:946:63032:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:conclusions are strengthened under these alternative specifications: if wealth shocks mainly
28:947:63124:18:39:71:386:528:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:affect the rich then the IRF becomes even more procyclical.46

28:949:63203:25:18:72:540:464:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In addition, we can compute impulse responses to shocks that roughly correspond to various
28:950:63293:18:18:72:540:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:policy experiments.  Since we do not think the business cycle is primarily driven by any
28:951:63381:18:18:72:539:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of these policy experiments, we now perform a slightly different experiment.  Rather than
28:952:63470:18:18:72:540:410:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:assuming that there are stochastic shocks to policy and picking these shocks to match the
28:953:63559:18:18:72:540:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:behavior of GDP, we introduce one-time unanticipated policy shocks on top of our previous
28:954:63648:18:18:72:540:374:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model with aggregate income shocks.  That is, we assume that households are subject to
28:955:63734:18:18:72:540:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate income shocks which, as before, are picked to match the behavior of U.S. GDP.
28:956:63821:18:18:72:540:338:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:We then compute the optimal response of households to a one-time unanticipated policy
28:957:63906:18:18:72:508:320:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:experiment at different points in the business cycle (as defined by aggregate income).
28:958:63992:18:18:89:539:302:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:While it is not computationally feasible to simultaneously introduce stochastic policy
28:959:64078:18:18:71:539:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shocks together with stochastic aggregate income shocks, we can compute the durable re-
28:960:64165:18:18:71:539:266:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sponse to changes in policy that are either completely temporary or are fully permanent.
28:961:64253:18:17:71:540:248:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:For brevity we only report results for permanent policy shocks, but temporary shocks de-
28:962:64341:17:18:71:539:231:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:liver similar time variation.  We compute the impulse response to three policy shocks: a
28:963:64429:18:18:71:539:213:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:permanent decline in the interest rate, a permanent decline in the payroll tax, and a subsidy
28:964:64522:18:18:71:539:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to durable adjustment (which isfinanced by an increase in taxes).47We view these policy
28:965:64609:18:18:71:539:177:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:experiments as rough approximations to the various stimulus policies such as reductions in
28:966:64699:18:16:81:539:159:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:45Wealth shocks induce greater time-series variationin IRFs because they are more persistent than income
28:967:64803:16:8:71:408:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:shocks and lead to larger movements in households desired durable holdings’.
28:968:64879:8:16:81:539:135:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:46This is because as we show shortly, in a model with liquidity constraints but no illiquid wealth, the
28:969:64982:16:11:72:539:119:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:IRF is mildly countercyclical.  Since this countercyclical effect of liquidity constraints is entirely driven by
28:970:65094:11:12:72:540:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:households close to the liquidity constraint, if these constrained households do not face wealth shocks then
28:971:65202:12:9:72:346:96:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:this effect is shut down and the IRF becomes more procyclical.
28:972:65264:9:0:81:436:87:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A:47In the modeling appendix we describe each of these experiments in more detail.

29:974:65435:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:2009. While we believe a more detailed quantitative study of these particular policies is an

29:977:65693:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shocks, which necessitates abstracting from some of the institutional details important to

29:981:65939:18:18:71:539:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is procyclical.  Table II shows that across time, the 95th percentile of the IRF on impact is
29:982:66032:18:38:71:539:225:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:60-129% larger than the 5th percentile for the interest rate, tax and durable subsidy shock.

29:987:66418:18:18:71:540:107:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:focuses on the broadest interpretation of durables withfixed adjustment costs. Nevertheless,
29:988:66510:18:18:71:539:89:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:this forces us to abstract from features that may make housing respond differently to shocks

30:998:67187:25:18:72:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Why is the IRF of durable expenditures to aggregate shocks procyclical?  These aggregate
30:999:67275:18:18:72:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:patterns arise because of the household-level non-linearities induced byfixed costs of durable

30:1001:67453:18:18:71:539:438:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:disappears when durable adjustment is frictionless.  We then discuss the microeconomic
30:1002:67539:18:18:71:539:420:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:mechanism that drives our result and provide additional evidence for this channel by further

30:1004:67656:18:18:89:539:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 11 shows the impulse response to income shocks in a model which is otherwise
30:1005:67739:18:18:71:539:366:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:identical to our benchmark model but with≡≡0.   Clearly there is much less
30:1006:67817:18:18:72:539:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:variation in impulse responses across time than in the model withfixed costs. Furthermore,
30:1007:67907:18:18:71:539:330:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:what variation there is now countercyclical instead of procyclical.   The reason the IRF
30:1008:67995:18:18:71:539:312:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:becomes countercyclical when there are nofixed costs of adjustment is that during recessions,
30:1009:68088:18:17:71:539:294:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:more households are close to the borrowing constraint, which increases the response of their
30:1010:68180:17:18:71:539:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable expenditures to income shocks. This is just a manifestation of the classic result that
30:1011:68274:18:18:71:539:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:marginal propensities to consume out of income shocks are larger for liquidity constrained
30:1012:68364:18:18:71:130:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households.
30:1013:68375:18:18:89:539:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:This experiment with nofixed costs of adjustment is important because it shows that
30:1014:68458:18:18:71:539:205:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:our results are driven byfixed costs rather than just by the sequence of aggregate shocks.
30:1015:68548:18:18:71:540:187:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In a model with incomplete markets, state-dependent IRFs could arise even withoutfixed

30:1017:68725:18:18:71:539:151:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f2:B:find evidence of this effect, but it works in the opposite direction of our headline result and
30:1018:68820:18:0:71:160:133:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is relatively mild.

31:1021:68956:26:18:72:539:347:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, in the model with nofixed costs of adjustment, which is inconsistent with micro data,

31:1023:69135:18:18:72:540:311:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that matches micro data, there is an extremely procyclical IRF.  Why dofixed costs of
31:1024:69220:18:18:72:540:293:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment induce a procyclical IRF?  We can see this by returning to the expression for

32:1055:70248:18:18:72:540:314:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:has negative skewness because depreciation means that more households want to increase
32:1056:70334:18:18:72:540:296:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:than to decrease durable holdings.  This becomes more pronounced during the boom, as
32:1057:70418:18:18:72:540:278:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households’ desired durable holdings rise and the distribution of durable gaps shifts to the
32:1058:70510:18:17:72:539:260:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:right.49As more households are now further from their desired level of durables, they move
32:1059:70600:17:18:71:539:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:into the region with a higher probability of adjustment, and since all households that adjust
32:1060:70693:18:18:71:539:225:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:will respond to aggregate shocks, aggregate durable expenditures become more responsive
32:1061:70780:18:18:71:539:207:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to these shocks.  This is amplified by the increase in the probability of adjustment during
32:1062:70871:18:18:71:539:189:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a boom.  Households are more likely to adjust to a given durable gap during a boom than
32:1063:70958:18:18:71:539:171:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:during a recession as thefixed costs of durable adjustment represent a smaller fraction of
32:1064:71048:18:16:71:165:153:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:household income.
32:1065:71065:16:15:81:539:137:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:48Note that here we are plotting the true model hazards and gaps (with no measurement error) while

32:1067:71267:12:12:72:540:110:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:is zero when the durable gap is equal to zero, measurement error leads the measured hazard to be strictly
32:1068:71372:12:8:72:164:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:positive at all points.
32:1069:71395:8:16:81:539:90:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:49The model with business cycles driven by aggregate wealth shocks delivers stronger movements in the
32:1070:71496:16:0:72:335:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:distribution of gaps since wealth shocks are more persistent.

33:1072:71648:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:During booms, a shock that increases households’ desired durable holdings will raise aggre-

33:1074:71830:18:18:72:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:also true that during booms, a shock that lowers households’ desired durable holdings will

33:1076:72010:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Our model implies an IRF that depends on the state of the business cycle; it does not imply

33:1083:72560:18:18:71:540:182:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Since our estimation procedure delivers values for(b)and(b)for each PSID sample

35:1123:75185:30:18:72:540:561:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:There is a large and important literature studying the role of general equilibrium in models

35:1125:75363:18:18:72:540:525:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that general equilibrium can eliminate the aggregate effects of micro lumpiness that had been
35:1126:75456:18:18:72:540:507:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:found in earlier partial equilibrium work such as Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger [1995].
35:1127:75547:18:18:72:540:489:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Given that our evidence thus far is purely partial equilibrium, it is important to explore
35:1128:75637:18:18:72:539:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:whether a similar effect arises in our model.   Does the inclusion of general equilibrium
35:1129:75726:18:18:71:540:453:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:price movements eliminate the time-varying IRF that wefind in partial equilibrium?  In

35:1131:75903:18:18:71:539:417:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium is less important for lumpy household durable adjustment than is often found

38:1216:79841:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:our results apply to a large variety of aggregate shocks and we simply want to argue that
38:1217:79930:18:27:72:361:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:general equilibrium does not undo our basic conclusions.

38:1220:80075:335:18:89:539:278:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Just as in partial equilibrium, wefind a quantitatively large procyclical IRF. Figure 16
38:1221:80163:18:17:71:539:260:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shows that there is large and procyclical variation in the IRF across time. It is worth noting
38:1222:80257:17:18:71:539:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that movements in the IRF in this version of the model do not line up quite as sharply with
38:1223:80348:18:18:71:540:225:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:recessions as in Figure 6. However, recall that we are feeding very different aggregate shocks
38:1224:80442:18:18:71:539:207:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:into these two models.  In Figure 6, we were hitting the economy with aggregate income
38:1225:80528:18:18:71:539:189:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shocks that exactly correspond to actual U.S. GDP, while in Figure 16 we are hitting the
38:1226:80616:18:18:71:539:171:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:economy with TFP shocks that correspond to U.S. Solow Residuals. Since TFP in the data
38:1227:80702:18:18:71:539:153:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:does not perfectly comove with GDP, it is not surprising that the resulting IRF would line
38:1228:80792:18:18:71:539:135:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:up less sharply with observed recessions. Nevertheless, our general conclusion remains: after
38:1229:80885:18:18:71:539:117:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sequences of TFP shocks that increase household income and wealth, durable responsiveness
38:1230:80974:18:18:71:96:99:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rises.
38:1231:80980:18:0:89:540:81:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Why does the addition of general equilibrium have little effect for aggregate dynamics in

39:1233:81159:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:because in our model, households have two sources of savings: households can save in liquid

39:1237:81510:18:18:72:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:motives.  If lumpy investment at thefirm level causes aggregate investment in capital to
39:1238:81598:18:18:72:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:move differently than in a frictionless RBC model, the representative household would face
39:1239:81688:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:more consumption volatility. That is because in their model,=+so a large change in

39:1241:81861:18:18:72:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:motive, there are then large price movements in general equilibrium that undo the partial
39:1242:81950:18:18:72:277:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium effects of lumpy investment.
39:1243:81990:18:18:89:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast, in our model=++In this environment, if lumpy durable

39:1247:82325:18:18:71:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:savings do not necessarily imply that households must violate consumption smoothing. This
39:1248:82414:18:18:71:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is similar to the intuition in Bachmann and Ma [2013] who argue that the presence of
39:1249:82498:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:inventories in a model with lumpy investment reduces the importance of general equilibrium

39:1252:82619:42:18:72:540:298:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we argue that time-series data on durable spending provides additional support
39:1253:82713:18:18:72:539:280:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for our theoretical model withfixed costs of durable adjustment.  Wefirst show that the
39:1254:82800:18:18:72:540:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model withfixed costs of durable adjustment delivers standard business cycle moments that
39:1255:82889:18:18:72:539:244:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:betterfit the data than a frictionless model with durable consumption. Since these moments
39:1256:82979:18:18:72:540:226:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:do not condition on the state of the business cycle, we refer to our model as better matching
39:1257:83072:18:18:72:545:208:145:g_d0_f25:145:g_d0_f2:B:unconditionalbusiness cycle moments.  While the frictionless model is not a goodfitto
39:1258:83157:18:18:71:539:190:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the data, it is straightforward to introduce convex adjustment costs into an RBC model
39:1259:83243:18:18:71:540:172:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to perfectly match the unconditional behavior of the model withfixed adjustment costs.
39:1260:83329:18:17:72:540:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:However, we next show that even though an RBC model with convex adjustment costs and a
39:1261:83415:17:18:72:540:137:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model withfixed costs of adjustment have observationally equivalent unconditional behavior,
39:1262:83506:18:18:71:539:119:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:they have very different implications for theconditionalbehavior of durable spending over
39:1263:83595:18:18:71:540:101:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the business cycle and that U.S. time-series data strongly supports the model withfixed
39:1264:83682:18:0:71:99:83:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:costs.
40:1265:83690:0:18:89:539:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Table 3 reports the unconditional business cycle moments from our model and how they
40:1266:83774:18:18:71:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:compare to data.55In addition, we report results for representative agent RBC models
40:1267:83858:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with and without convex adjustment costs, which we describe in Appendix 5.  Clearly, the
40:1268:83946:18:18:72:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:representative agent model with frictionless durable adjustment is a poorfit to the data.

40:1277:84378:23:18:89:539:471:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:The reason that investment in the frictionless RBC model is too volatile is because this
40:1278:84466:18:18:71:540:453:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model features the comovement problem identified in Greenwood and Hercowitz [1991] and
40:1279:84552:18:17:71:539:435:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:further explored in Fisher [1997].  A change in productivity changes the relative returns to
40:1280:84644:17:18:71:539:418:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:saving in productive capital vs durables. An increase in productivity makes it more valuable
40:1281:84736:18:18:71:539:400:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to shift saving into productive capital, and the additional output produced can later be
40:1282:84824:18:18:71:540:382:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:used tofinance durable consumption. This generates a strong negative correlation between
40:1283:84912:18:18:71:539:364:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable expenditures and investment in productive capital in the models with no adjustment
40:1284:85002:18:18:71:539:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:costs and increases the volatility of both variables.  The introduction of adjustment costs
40:1285:85093:18:18:71:539:328:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:breaks this comovement problem and substantially dampens the volatility of investment.
40:1286:85179:18:18:71:540:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In addition,fixed costs of adjustment make a fraction of household wealth illiquid, which
40:1287:85268:18:18:71:540:292:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:amplifies the volatility of non-durable consumption for the reasons explored in Kaplan and

40:1290:85463:18:18:71:539:238:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that we reach a similar conclusion. Moreover, quadratic adjustment costs can substantially
40:1291:85553:18:18:71:540:220:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:improve thefit of the representative agent model.56The third column of Table 3 shows that
40:1292:85642:18:17:72:540:202:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we can pick adjustment costs in an RBC model to generate exactly the same volatility of in-

40:1294:85834:16:12:71:539:169:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:residential investment.  The BEA treats durable and residential investment differently, including housing
40:1295:85939:12:12:71:539:157:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:services in GDP while excluding durable services.  In both our model and data analysis, we define GDP
40:1296:86040:12:12:71:539:145:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:as consumer durable expenditures + private domestic investment + non-durable expenditures (excluding
40:1297:86140:12:8:71:147:133:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:housing services).
40:1298:86158:8:16:81:539:125:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:56Smooth adjustment costs can be microfounded in various ways:  Gomme, Kydland, and Rupert [2001]

41:1302:86458:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that while adjustment costs are important for matching the volatility of durable spending in
41:1303:86550:18:18:72:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the data, the form of the adjustment costs cannot be identified from unconditional business
41:1304:86641:18:18:71:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:cycle movements: quadratic adjustment costs andfixed costs of adjustment can produce
41:1305:86725:18:18:71:383:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:exactly the same dampening of durable spending on average.
41:1306:86783:18:18:89:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:However, we now argue that the volatility of durable expendituresconditionalon the
41:1307:86865:18:18:71:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate state of the business cycle can provide additional identification that supports
41:1308:86954:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the presence offixed adjustment costs.  In particular, aggregate durable expenditures are
41:1309:87043:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:systematically more volatile during expansions than they are during slumps.  This arises
41:1310:87131:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:naturally in the model withfixed costs of durable adjustment, since we have shown that that
41:1311:87222:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model generates a procyclical IRF but not in models with convex adjustment costs. Beyond
41:1312:87310:18:18:71:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:supporting thefixed cost specification, we believe this result is interesting in its own right
41:1313:87404:18:18:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for optimal policy design.  Since policies are not implemented randomly over the business
41:1314:87493:18:17:71:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:cycle, conditional responses are likely to be more informative for the effects of policy than
41:1315:87586:17:18:71:215:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:are unconditional responses.

41:1326:88505:18:18:72:540:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:variance was 50% larger than at the trough of the 2007 recession (when durable investment

41:1328:88614:18:17:89:539:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In principle, conditional heteroscedasticity could arise for two reasons: (1) The economy
41:1329:88703:17:18:71:539:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is subject to shocks of constant variance but durable expenditures respond more to these
41:1330:88791:18:16:81:539:188:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:57Since we only pick two adjustment cost parameters, we can directly target the volatility of durable and
41:1331:88896:16:12:72:539:172:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:capital investment, and we get a slightly different number for the volatility of non-durable consumption.

43:1350:89776:18:18:89:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Appendix 6 shows that while durable expenditures exhibit conditional heteroscedasticity,
43:1351:89864:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:there is no evidence for heteroscedasticity for either productivity or monetary shocks. Thus,
43:1352:89957:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:there is no evidence for heteroscedasticity among the most common shocks used in business
43:1353:90046:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:cycle models. Furthermore, aggregate GDP also does not exhibit conditional heteroscedas-
43:1354:90134:18:18:72:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ticity, and since the aggregate shocks affecting durable expenditures and total GDP should
43:1355:90224:18:18:71:544:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:be similar, we interpret conditional heteroscedasticity of durable expendituresasevidence
43:1356:90313:18:18:72:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of thefirst explanation:  durable expenditures become more responsive to aggregate shocks
43:1357:90402:18:18:72:220:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:during business cycle booms.
43:1358:90430:18:18:89:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Since the model withfixed costs of adjustment implies procyclical responsiveness while
43:1359:90516:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the model with convex adjustment costs does not, the aggregate time-series evidence thus
43:1360:90604:18:18:72:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:supports the former model.  Indeed, Appendix 6 shows that the model withfixed costs im-
43:1361:90691:18:17:72:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:plies conditional heteroscedasticity that is highly significant and in-line with the aggregate
43:1362:90785:17:18:72:540:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:data while the model with convex adjustment costs generates no conditional heteroscedas-
43:1363:90873:18:18:72:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ticity.   In addition, Berger and Vavra [2014] provide additional time-series evidence for
43:1364:90963:18:18:72:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:procyclical durable spending responsiveness.  In that paper, we use an STVAR to estimate
43:1365:91051:18:18:72:540:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the durable spending multiplier in response to identified government spending changes and
43:1366:91140:18:69:72:327:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:show that it rises dramatically during expansions.

43:1368:91201:29:18:72:540:287:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this paper, we argue that household-level durable adjustment frictions matter for aggregate
43:1369:91295:18:18:72:540:269:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics.  We use a novel indirect inference procedure to estimate an incomplete markets
43:1370:91383:18:18:72:539:251:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model withfixed costs of durable adjustment and show that it does a very good job of
43:1371:91467:18:18:71:540:233:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:explaining various microeconomic consumption patterns.   More importantly, this model
43:1372:91552:18:18:71:539:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:implies that as household wealth and income falls during a recession, fewer households adjust
43:1373:91645:18:18:71:539:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:their durable holdings or are on the margin of doing so.  This means that the elasticity of
43:1374:91736:18:18:71:530:179:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate durable expenditures to shocks which affect durable demand falls substantially.
43:1375:91825:18:18:89:539:161:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We provide support for this mechanism in various ways.  In addition to showing that
43:1376:91908:18:18:71:539:143:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the average frequency of durable adjustment indeed falls in recessions, we show that cross-
43:1377:91999:18:18:71:539:125:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sectional distributions in the PSID data move as predicted by our model and that aggregate
43:1378:92089:18:18:71:539:107:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable expenditures are less responsive to reduced form time-series shocks during recessions.
43:1379:92183:18:18:89:540:89:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Our results have implications for estimating the efficacy of durable stimulus.  The re-
43:1380:92270:18:0:71:540:71:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sponse of durable expenditures to changes in policy is highly dependent on the aggregate
44:1381:92360:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:state of the economy, which means that using estimates from linear VARs to estimate the
44:1382:92447:18:18:72:539:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:effects of any such program is likely to be misleading.  While a growing body of research
44:1383:92536:18:18:72:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:argues that the government spending multiplier should be countercyclical,60the forces we
44:1384:92624:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:identify push in the opposite direction.  In Berger and Vavra [2014] we provide STVAR
44:1385:92709:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:evidence that while the overall government spending multiplier is indeed countercyclical, the
44:1386:92802:18:18:72:502:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:"durable spending" multiplier is instead procyclical, just as predicted by our model.
44:1387:92887:18:18:89:539:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we emphasized the general mechanism that causes micro adjustment fric-
44:1388:92972:18:18:72:540:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:tions to lead to procyclical IRFs. As such, we considered a variety of aggregate shocks and
44:1389:93063:18:18:72:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:explored a very broad definition of durables that should include all durable goods subject
44:1390:93153:18:18:72:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to transaction costs of adjustment.  In future work, we plan to explore our model impli-

44:1392:93325:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Homebuyer" credit.  Realistic policy analysis will require enriching our model to include
44:1393:93414:18:18:72:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:various institutional details that are beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, our mod-
44:1394:93507:18:17:72:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:eling insights should continue to apply and we hope to quantify their importance for specific
44:1395:93600:17:18:72:540:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:policies.  For example, Mian and Sufi[2012] use cross-sectional variation in the propensity
44:1396:93691:18:18:72:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of clunkers to estimate the average effect of the "Cash-for-Clunkers" program, but our model
44:1397:93783:18:18:71:540:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:also implies that the effects of the policy should differ geographically with the distribution
44:1398:93877:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of wealth and local economic conditions.  More generally, understanding durable spending
44:1399:93965:18:18:71:539:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:patterns requires understanding the level and distribution of wealth in an economy and how
44:1400:94055:18:28:71:253:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:this distribution moves across time.

48:1474:98586:37:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:This appendix discusses provides additional discussion of our PSID data analysis.   We
48:1475:98672:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:restrict our analysis to 1999-2011 because prior to 1999, the PSID did not collect the data
48:1476:98763:18:18:72:540:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:necessary for our analysis.   Beginning in 1999, the PSID contains detailed information

48:1478:98924:18:18:72:540:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:holdings.  Although more detailed non-durable consumption data is available beginning in
48:1479:99012:18:18:72:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:2003, for comparability we use only variables that are available beginning in 1999. The value
48:1480:99105:18:18:72:540:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for non-durable expenditures is the sum of all components of food consumption, utilities,
48:1481:99194:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:transportation expenses, schooling expenses and health services. Our measure of−1is the
48:1482:99282:18:17:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sum of last periods housing value and vehicle values.  Assets are the sum of business value,
48:1483:99374:17:18:71:390:475:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:stocks, iras, cash, bonds, minus the value of outstanding debt.
48:1484:99437:18:18:89:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Our benchmark analysis is restricted to home-owners with household headage 65.
48:1485:99516:18:18:72:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:After constructing each of our variables, we deflate these nominal values using NIPA price
48:1486:99606:18:18:72:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:indices and remove a householdfixed effect.  To define durable adjustment, we combine
48:1487:99691:18:18:72:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:several questions in the PSID.  In our benchmark results, we define durable adjustment
48:1488:99777:18:18:72:540:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:as a self-reported house or vehicle sale together with a 20% change in the reported value
48:1489:99866:18:18:72:540:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of the durable stock. We use a combination of self-reported adjustment and a minimum
48:1490:99950:18:18:72:540:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:threshold for several reasons.  1) Combining these indicators is likely to reduce spurious
48:1491:100040:18:18:72:540:331:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustments due to measurement error.  2) Some house sales are likely to be the results
48:1492:100127:18:18:72:540:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of idiosyncratic moves across location which may not lead to any substantial adjustment in
48:1493:100217:18:18:72:540:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the size of the stock. 3) Finally, and most importantly, self-reported adjustment indicators
48:1494:100309:18:18:72:540:277:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ask about adjustment over the previous three years while the sample is conducted every
48:1495:100395:18:18:72:540:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:two years.  This implies that the same adjustment may be counted twice.  Requiring a
48:1496:100479:18:18:72:540:241:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:simultaneous change in value and self-reported adjustment reduces this concern. We chose
48:1497:100567:18:17:72:539:223:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a 25% threshold because the median change inthe reported durable stock conditional on
48:1498:100652:17:18:72:540:206:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:self-reported adjustment is 40% while the median change conditional on no adjustment is
48:1499:100739:18:18:72:540:188:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:4%, so a 20% threshold roughly splits this distance. This adjustment definition generates an
48:1500:100831:18:18:72:274:170:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment probability of roughly 10%.
48:1501:100869:18:18:89:540:152:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 1 applies this adjustment definition to our broad measure of durables that includes
48:1502:100959:18:18:72:540:134:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:housing and vehicles as well as to a more narrow definition that focuses just on housing after
48:1503:101053:18:18:71:539:116:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:removing deterministic age effects.   We split the sample in 1999 for the housing series
48:1504:101141:18:18:71:539:98:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:because the sampling frequency and thus questions change slightly and there appears to be
48:1505:101230:18:39:71:539:80:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a trend break in the series.  Table A1 reports results a for a panel logit for the probability

49:1508:101417:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:falls by around 20% during recessions while the probability of buying/selling a house falls

49:1518:101935:18:18:71:539:478:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:sions are capturing time-trends rather than something about recessions. To argue that this
49:1519:102025:18:18:71:539:460:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:is not the case, we perform a similar exercise using cross-state variation in unemployment
49:1520:102115:18:18:71:539:442:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rates. Running a logit of broad durable adjustment on local unemployment rates shows that
49:1521:102204:18:18:71:539:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:a two standard deviation in unemployment lowers the odds of durable adjustment by 30-
49:1522:102289:18:18:71:540:406:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:40%.  This statistically significant decline in the frequency of durable adjustment is robust

51:1608:106541:18:18:71:539:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:than constructing real GDP with the GDP deflator.  However, the necessary chained GDP

51:1611:106808:18:18:71:540:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the price deflators, the real series constructed by deflating the nominal series individually do

53:1673:109867:33:18:89:539:595:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Since the choice when adjusting is two-dimensional it takes substantially longer tofind

53:1675:110044:18:18:71:539:559:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ing.  Thus, eliminating a state-variable from this problem dramatically speeds calculations.
53:1676:110136:18:18:71:539:541:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Given these value functions, we approximatee(:;:)and(::;:)as

53:1679:110406:18:18:72:540:487:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of capital, so before solving the model with aggregate shocks, we solve for the steady-state
53:1680:110498:18:18:72:540:469:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of the model.  The solution method is similar and simpler than the solution with aggregate
53:1681:110588:18:18:72:266:451:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:shocks, so we only describe the latter:
53:1682:110627:18:17:93:539:433:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Given an initial guess for the value functions and transition function, we solve for the

53:1685:110889:18:18:71:539:380:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:function.  The values of adjusting and not adjusting are compared, to generate the overall
53:1686:110979:18:18:71:539:362:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:policy function and to update the overall value function. We iterate until the separate value

53:1688:111159:18:18:71:539:326:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:solve for the optimal policy function an additional time on afiner grid, to use for simulation.
53:1689:111254:18:18:89:539:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We then simulate a panel of households and compute the evolution of the aggregate

55:1741:115487:18:18:71:539:451:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:problematic in a world with measurement error.  Since this function is non-linear, even if
55:1742:115577:18:18:71:539:433:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:measurement error is on average zero it need not produce estimates which are on average

55:1746:115923:18:18:72:414:361:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:approximateby a linear function of various observable variables.
55:1747:115988:18:18:89:539:343:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In particular, we assume that()=0+1−1+2−1+3+4−1In practice,

57:1878:121253:18:17:71:540:313:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:parameters at various starting values converges to the same best-fit results, which suggests

57:1880:121383:18:18:89:539:278:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Furthermore, we can argue more strongly for local identification by varying individual

60:2045:123649:18:18:72:338:192:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:error to demonstrate that there is a clear minimum.
60:2046:123700:18:18:89:539:174:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:However, it is worth noting that the variation in densities and hazards induced by mea-

60:2048:123879:18:18:72:540:138:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:so if any parameter is not particularly well-identified it is probably the amount of measure-
60:2049:123972:18:18:72:540:120:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:ment error.  However, this is not a huge concern for our results as we are not particularly
60:2050:124063:18:18:72:540:102:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:interested in assessing the amount of measurement error in PSID variables.  Furthermore,
60:2051:124151:18:0:72:540:84:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:measurement error does not really affect any of our conclusions aside from their affect on

61:2054:124418:18:18:71:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:changes in measurement error.  Since the measurement error parameter does not affect the
61:2055:124506:18:18:71:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:actual PSID data, changing its importance has no effect on the conclusions for the implied

61:2061:124900:26:18:72:540:517:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we explore two additional aspects of our estimation. 1) Can our estimation

61:2063:125079:17:35:71:133:482:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:predictions?

61:2065:125130:46:292:136:474:401:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:Figure 25: Empirical Results for Grossman Laroque (1990) Model
61:2066:125192:292:18:89:540:109:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:First, to what extent is the empirical hazard actually a test for misspecification in our
61:2067:125281:18:18:71:540:91:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model?  Since we target the density and hazarddirectly, perhaps it is just mechanical that
61:2068:125371:18:0:71:539:73:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:wefind a goodfit for these variables. To assess this, we apply our gap imputation procedure
62:2069:125464:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to PSID data using the model from Grossman and Laroque [1990]. In this model, households
62:2070:125552:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:target a constant fraction of liquid wealth when adjusting, so it is straightforward to impute
62:2071:125646:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable gaps.  To what extent do these durable gaps provide predictive power for actual
62:2072:125733:18:18:72:540:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment patterns?  Figure 25 shows that the answer is: not at all.  Gaps imputed using
62:2073:125822:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the structural model of 25 generate a nearlyflat hazard (varying from 0.06 to 0.12) but more
62:2074:125914:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:importantly, the hazard is not upward sloping in the absolute gap.  Households which are
62:2075:126002:18:18:72:410:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:predicted to adjust by the model are actually less likely to adjust.
62:2076:126070:18:18:89:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Clearly the model of 25 is highly stylized since it ignores liquidity constraints and has
62:2077:126159:18:18:72:540:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:no non-durable consumption, and clearly these things matter empirically. The point of this
62:2078:126249:18:18:72:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:section is not that 25 is a bad model but is instead to illustrate that using an (S,s) model
62:2079:126341:18:18:72:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with atheoreticalupward sloping hazard to impute gaps does not imply that the resulting
62:2080:126428:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f25:145:g_d0_f2:B:empiricalhazard need be upward sloping. In this sense, the behavior of the empirical hazard
62:2081:126519:18:18:72:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:implied by the structural model is indeed a good test for misspecification of the structural

62:2084:126634:25:18:71:539:415:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Our model was estimated to match PSID data, and we showed that we canfind parameters
62:2085:126718:18:18:71:540:397:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:so that the model is a goodfit to the behavior of households in this sample.  In this sense,
62:2086:126810:18:18:71:540:379:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:our extremely strongfit is constructed "in-sample".  If we apply our same model estimates

62:2088:126992:18:18:71:356:343:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:power?  In this section we argue that the answer is yes.
62:2089:127048:18:18:89:539:325:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:To our knowledge the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW)

62:2093:127399:17:18:71:539:254:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:1987 as the survey methodology has remained roughly constant over this time period. In
62:2094:127485:18:18:71:539:236:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:particular, we use the 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995,1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and

63:2124:128939:258:18:89:539:316:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we impose the same structural relationship from on the model on this data (as
63:2125:129022:18:18:71:539:298:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we did in the PSID) to generate empirical measures of the empirical durable gap. Given
63:2126:129108:18:18:71:539:280:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:estimates of these gap, we can then calculate the probability of adjustment as a function
63:2127:129197:18:18:71:539:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:of the durable gap.  Unfortunately, unlike the PSID, there are fewer variables explicitly
63:2128:129286:18:18:71:539:244:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:asking households about their durable adjustment, so we must define adjustment purely in
63:2129:129374:18:18:71:539:226:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:terms of some adjustment threshold.  We define durable adjustment as times when the
63:2130:129457:18:18:71:539:208:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:household either had non-zero expenditure in a period on means of transport or a 40%
63:2131:129541:18:18:71:539:190:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:change in the reported value of real estate. The results are qualitatively robust (the hazard
63:2132:129634:18:18:71:539:172:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:rate is increasing in the durable gap) to using different minimum thresholds including the
63:2133:129724:18:18:71:540:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:25% threshold we used in our benchmark specification in the PSID. The main difference is
63:2134:129812:18:18:71:540:136:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that a 25% threshold implies that the annual frequency of adjustment is approximately 30%,
63:2135:129902:18:18:71:495:118:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:whereas a 40% threshold implies an annual frequency of adjustment closer to 15%.
63:2136:129982:18:17:89:539:100:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 26 shows the distribution of gaps and hazards that arise in SHIW data when
63:2137:130063:17:0:71:540:83:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:applying our model which is estimated on PSID data.   Clearly, we continue tofind an
64:2138:130149:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:extremely strong upward sloping hazard.  In addition, the gap distribution continues to

64:2140:130259:18:18:89:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to computing the average distribution and hazard, we can also redo the

64:2142:130427:18:18:72:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the SHIW. Since there is no comparable business cycle dating committee for Italy, we plot

64:2161:130898:30:18:72:540:181:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we extend our model to include two features which are particularly important
64:2162:130990:18:38:72:408:163:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for housing markets: rental markets and collateralized borrowing.
64:2163:131055:38:26:72:226:125:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:11.1  Rental Markets
64:2164:131075:26:18:72:540:99:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this section we show that the inclusion of rental markets does not change any of the
64:2165:131162:18:0:72:540:81:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:conclusions from our model.  We choose not to include rental markets in our benchmark
65:2166:131249:0:18:72:540:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model for several reasons: 1) Since we want to use a broad measure of durables as our
65:2167:131334:18:18:72:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:benchmark that encompasses all durable goods subject to lumpy adjustment costs, we must
65:2168:131421:18:18:72:539:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:necessarily aggregate differentdurablegoodsthataresomewhatdifferent into one good.
65:2169:131503:18:18:71:539:654:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Overall, consumer durable spending is a larger fraction of total household durable spending
65:2170:131594:18:18:71:540:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:than is residential investment, so it makes sense for our benchmark calibration to reflect
65:2171:131684:18:18:71:539:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:something closer to consumer durable markets than housing markets. While rental markets
65:2172:131771:18:18:71:540:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:are clearly important for housing, rental markets are not particularly important for consumer
65:2173:131864:18:18:71:539:582:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables such as automobiles and furniture.  2) Our estimation procedure is based on the
65:2174:131952:18:18:71:539:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:concept of the "gap" between a household’s current durable holdings and those it would
65:2175:132038:18:18:71:539:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:choose if it temporarily faced no adjustment costs.   While this gap is well-defined for
65:2176:132126:18:18:71:539:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable owners, it is not well-defined for renters.  In general, even if temporarily facing no
65:2177:132220:18:18:71:539:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:adjustment costs, households may still choose not to purchase. 3) Finally, even for renters,
65:2178:132312:18:18:71:539:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:in reality moving is not costless. In order to remain computationally feasible, our extension
65:2179:132405:18:17:71:539:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:with rental markets assumes that households can costlessly adjust their durable holdings
65:2180:132493:17:18:71:539:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:when renting.  Thus, this model likely underestimates true frictions to durable adjustment.
65:2181:132584:18:18:71:540:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Nevertheless, we now show that including this extension has only small effects on our results.
65:2182:132678:18:18:89:539:421:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:We extend the benchmark model by allowing households to rent durables. These durables
65:2183:132763:18:18:71:539:403:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:depreciate fully each period and are more expensive due to the presence of higher deprecia-
65:2184:132854:18:51:71:532:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:tion, but they are not subject to adjustment costs.  The household value function is then:

65:2204:133611:18:0:72:540:84:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model with rental markets in Figures 28 and 30. Just as in our baseline model, we are able
66:2205:133703:0:18:72:248:708:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:to well-explain the empirical data.
66:2206:133738:18:18:89:540:690:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:After estimating the rental market model, we explore its aggregate implications.  Given
66:2207:133825:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:gaps and hazards in the PSID data from 1999-2011, we can use (1) to compute an implied

66:2209:133998:18:18:89:539:636:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, we can calculate the true impulse responses to shocks in our structural model.
66:2210:134089:18:18:72:540:618:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Just as in the benchmark model, the model with rental markets delivers a strong state-

66:2213:134353:18:18:72:540:564:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:For brevity, we do not show results for other aggregate shocks or for alternative measures of

66:2217:134617:18:18:72:540:464:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:understanding some durable markets: the role of collateralized borrowing. In our benchmark
66:2218:134707:18:18:72:539:446:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:model, we assume that=1so that households cannot borrow against their durables.
66:2219:134787:18:18:71:539:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we relax that assumption.  Since collateralized borrowing is particularly
66:2220:134877:18:18:71:539:410:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:important for housing, we think of this robustness check as one that applies more to housing
66:2221:134969:18:18:71:281:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:markets than to broad durable spending.
66:2222:135008:18:18:89:539:374:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:In this extension, we assume that households can borrow up to 80% of the value of their
66:2223:135095:18:18:71:539:356:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durables: that is we assume that=02so that households must put down a 20% down-
66:2224:135176:18:18:71:539:338:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:payment.  The reason that we do not include collateralized borrowing in our benchmark
66:2225:135261:18:18:71:539:320:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:specification is because technical considerations force us to admit this borrowing in a way
66:2226:135352:18:18:71:539:302:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:that we view as somewhat empirically unrealistic.  Since it is not feasible to have a sep-
66:2227:135442:18:18:71:539:284:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:arate adjustment cost on durable equity together with afixed cost of durable adjustment
66:2228:135529:18:18:72:540:266:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:we must assume that durable equity can be adjusted costlessly.  That is, the collateralized
66:2229:135620:18:17:72:539:248:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing model which is numerically feasible must allow for costless refinancing.  Clearly
66:2230:135711:17:18:72:540:231:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:households in the real world cannot costlessly extract equity from their durables and do not
66:2231:135803:18:18:72:539:213:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:refinance continuously.  Thus, the specification with collateralized borrowing with friction-
66:2232:135896:18:18:72:540:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:less equity adjustment substantially overstates households’ ability to smooth idiosyncratic
66:2233:135987:18:18:72:475:177:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:earnings shocks and substantially understates the illiquidity of durable wealth.
66:2234:136067:18:18:89:539:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Nevertheless, our basic message goes through: even with costless equity adjustment,
66:2235:136150:18:18:72:539:141:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:durable responsiveness remains procyclical. To solve the model with=02we reformulate
66:2236:136236:18:18:71:539:123:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:the problem using "voluntary equity" as in in Diaz and Luengo-Prado [2010].  This rec-

66:2238:136414:18:0:71:539:87:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:reformulated model is solved identically to the model in our baseline results. Figure 33 and

74:2445:141380:27:18:89:539:404:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:It is important to note that while we have interpreted conditional heteroscedasticity as a

74:2447:141560:18:18:71:539:368:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:interpretation is that aggregate shocks themselves are larger during booms than during reces-

74:2450:141830:18:18:72:540:314:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:there is no evidence of conditional heteroscedasticity for GDP.  Presumably the aggregate

74:2454:142175:17:18:72:539:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:As further evidence for this point, we also estimate the time-series model for changes in

74:2457:142387:18:18:71:540:189:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:We also bootstrapped the procedure to construct corresponding confidence intervals.  To
74:2458:142474:18:18:71:539:171:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:do this, we redraw residuals from thefirst stage to create one-thousand bootstrap samples

74:2464:142980:15:12:72:540:84:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:it is likely that the actual rate is more relevant for durable purchases as households should respond to both

75:2468:143302:18:18:72:540:672:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for our simulated models. Since we know that the true shocks in the model follow an AR(1)

75:2475:143858:18:18:89:540:546:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A:Whilefixed costs induce procyclical impulse response functions, they need not be the
75:2476:143942:18:18:72:540:528:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:only mechanism that can generate these dynamics.   Another possible explanation for a
75:2477:144027:18:18:72:540:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:procyclical IRF is the presence of collateral constraints.  If collateral constraints tighten
75:2478:144120:18:18:72:540:492:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:during recessions, then durable expenditures may respond less to shocks during recessions
75:2479:144209:18:17:72:540:474:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:than during booms. We have tested for this using the models with collateral constraints in
75:2480:144299:17:18:72:540:457:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:Appendix 4. However, wefind that this mechanism is quantitatively weak. This is partially
75:2481:144388:18:18:71:539:439:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:because the response to time-varying credit conditions is solely one-sided.  A tightening of

75:2484:144665:18:18:71:539:385:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:B:for time-varying IRFs.  Furthermore, wefind no empirical support for such asymmetric
