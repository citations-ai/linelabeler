3:26:788:27:28:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:In  the  current  paper,  we  aim  to  estimate  workers'  marginal  costs  of  commuting.  These  costs  
3:27:894:28:27:72:544:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:include  mainly  travel  time  costs  and  monetary  costs,  but  they  may  also  include  other  costs  that  
3:28:1006:27:28:72:543:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:affect the utility of travel (e.g., stress, risk of accidents). Commuting costs play an important role 
3:29:1109:28:27:72:544:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:in  hundreds  of  studies  that  contribute  to  urban  economics  theory  (e.g.,  Wheaton,  1974;  Fujita,  
3:30:1218:27:28:72:542:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:1989). In the Alonso-Muth-Mills monocentric model, commuting costs not only determine urban 
3:31:1310:28:28:71:545:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:spatial  structure  –  by  influencing  the  size  of  the  city  –  they  also  determine  whether  a  city  is  
3:32:1424:28:27:71:544:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:monocentric  at  all  (Ogawa  and  Fujita,  1980;  Fujita  and  Ogawa,  1982),  and  generally  they  will  
3:33:1532:27:28:71:545:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:determine  land,  and  therefore  house,  prices,  as  well.1  However,  it  turns  out  that  we  know  
3:34:1637:28:27:72:354:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:surprisingly little about the size of these commuting costs. 
3:35:1698:27:28:107:547:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:A  large  number  of  transport  economics  studies  focus  on  the  time   component   of   
3:36:1791:28:28:72:543:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:commuting costs (e.g., Small et al., 2005). Estimates of the time component of commuting costs 
3:37:1886:28:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:vary by a large margin, but studies tend to find that the value of travel time is 20% to 100% of 
3:38:1983:27:28:72:539:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:the  hourly  (gross)  wage  (Small,  1992).  De  Borger  and  Fosgerau  (2008)  find  strong  reference-
3:39:2087:28:27:72:545:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:point  effects  in  stated  preference  data  and  suggest  a  way  to  correct  for  this  effect.  Revealed  
3:40:2198:27:34:72:542:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:preference  studies  tend  to  find  substantially  higher  values  than  stated  preference  studies.2

3:42:2359:7:24:72:543:255:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:1 Commuting costs are also relevant to other economics fields, such as labour economics, because these 
3:43:2462:24:19:72:543:231:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:costs affect the cost of being employed, and therefore workers' labour supply (e.g., Wales, 1978; Cogan, 
3:44:2567:19:19:72:544:212:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:1981;  Parry  and  Bento,  2001),  as  well  as  workers'  reservation  and  realised  wages  (e.g.,  Van  den  Berg,  
3:45:2686:19:14:72:359:193:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:1992; Van den Berg and Gorter, 1997, Manning, 2003a; 2003b). 
3:46:2747:14:24:72:543:179:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:2 The majority of (transport economics) studies that assess the costs associated with travel time are based 
3:47:2855:24:19:72:543:155:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:on actual commuters' mode and route choices (Miller, 1989; Small, 1992; Hensher, 1997 and Small et al., 
3:48:2959:19:19:72:544:136:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:2005).  There  are  likely,  however,  some  serious  problems  with  these  studies,  with  regard  to  correlation  
3:49:3077:19:19:72:544:117:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:between  travel  time  and  cost,  and  the  difficulty  of  measuring  the  travel  time  and  cost  associated  with  
3:50:3197:19:19:72:542:98:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:different travel alternatives. A related technique avoids these problems by exploiting subjective response 
3:51:3304:19:0:72:542:79:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:data on choices among hypothetical trip or mode alternatives that differ in time and cost components (see 
4:52:3411:0:28:72:543:710:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Although the time component is an important part of the commuting costs, the other components 
4:53:3505:28:28:72:547:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:are  not  negligible,  and  may  therefore  not  be  ignored  (Cogan,  1981). For  commuters,  the  
4:54:3604:28:27:72:543:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:monetary costs are thought to be about 30% to 40% of the time costs (e.g., Fujita, 1989; Small, 
4:55:3700:27:28:72:543:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:1992). Furthermore, workers may vary the speed of their commute through their choice of travel 
4:56:3795:28:27:72:545:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:mode,  so  the  share  of  the  time  costs  as  part  of  the  total  commuting  costs  is  endogenously  
4:57:3902:27:28:72:543:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:determined. As a consequence, information on the costs of the time component is not necessarily 
4:58:3998:28:28:72:290:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:informative about the total commuting costs. 
4:59:4043:28:27:107:544:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:For  all  travel  modes  except  car  use,  the  marginal  monetary  costs  are  easy  to  determine.  
4:60:4146:27:28:72:545:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:For  non-motorized  transport  (bicycling,  walking),  the  marginal  monetary  costs  are  (close  to)  
4:61:4251:28:27:72:542:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:zero; for public transport (train, bus, metro), the marginal monetary costs can be derived from the 
4:62:4351:27:28:72:545:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:price  paid  for  the  ticket.  For  car  users,  however,  who  are  the  majority  of  commuters,  the  
4:63:4457:28:28:72:544:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:marginal  monetary  costs  associated  with  commuting  are  not  so  straightforward  to  determine.  
4:64:4560:28:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:These costs of car use comprise not only the variable costs of car use (fuel, depreciation of the 
4:65:4658:27:28:71:543:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:car due to its use), but also costs that are related to the ownership of the car (interest, insurance, 
4:66:4761:28:27:71:543:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:etc).  The  latter  cost  component  is  frequently  treated  as  fixed,  and  it  is  therefore  assumed  not  to  
4:67:4877:27:28:71:544:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:affect  workers'  marginal  costs  of  travel.  This  may  be  argued  to  be  a  relevant  assumption  in  the  
4:68:4990:28:28:71:543:268:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:United States, where car availability is high and almost all workers commute by car. Outside the 
4:69:5087:28:27:71:544:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:United  States,  the  proportion  of  workers who commute by car is much smaller. For example in 
4:70:5184:27:28:71:543:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:the  Netherlands,  approximately  50%  of  workers  commute  by  car.  Car  ownership  decisions  will  
4:71:5288:28:27:71:543:185:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:frequently depend on the length of the commuting distance, which constitutes about one third of 
4:72:5384:27:28:71:543:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:a car's mileage (De Jong, 1990). Consequently, even though treating car ownership costs as fixed 
4:73:5481:28:13:72:542:130:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                                                                                                                                                           
4:74:5667:13:19:72:544:117:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:Hensher,  1997;  Verhoef  et  al.,  1997;  Calfee  and  Winston,  1998;  Fosgerau,  2005).  With  such  data,  the  
4:75:5783:19:19:72:543:98:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:problems of revealed preference data are eliminated by design. However, this advantage is gained at the 
4:76:5887:19:0:71:499:79:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:cost of introducing a range of biases related to the hypothetical nature of data (McFadden 1999). 
5:77:5986:0:28:72:544:710:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:may  make  sense  with  respect  to  some  travel  decisions,  these  costs  are  clearly  not  fixed  with  
5:78:6095:28:28:72:186:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:respect to commuting.3 
5:79:6117:28:27:107:546:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Workers'  marginal  commuting  costs  can  be  derived  in  various  ways.  One  method,  
5:80:6207:27:28:72:546:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:familiar  to  labour  economists,  is  to  use  the  trade  off  between  wages  and  the  length  of  the  
5:81:6315:28:27:72:544:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:commute,  using  hedonic  wage  models,  as  developed  by  Rosen  (1986),  see  for  example  Zax  
5:82:6415:27:28:72:546:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:(1991).  But  such  a  method  has  a  number  of  disadvantages,  as  it  relies  on  the  (implicit)  
5:83:6519:28:28:72:545:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:assumption  that  workers  have  full  information  about  availability  of  jobs  and  do  not  have  to  
5:84:6626:28:27:72:543:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:search for jobs (Hwang et al., 1992; Hwang et al., 1998; Gronberg and Reed, 1994). A number of 
5:85:6721:27:28:72:545:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:studies  have  shown  that  estimates  of  valuation  of  job  attributes,  such  as  commuting  time,  are  
5:86:6830:28:27:72:543:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:likely  seriously  downward-biased  if  hedonic  wage  models  are  used  (Gronberg  and  Reed,  1994;  
5:87:6934:27:28:72:543:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Van Ommeren et al., 2000; Villanueva, 2007).  An alternative method is to rely on the trade off 
5:88:7030:28:28:72:543:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:between house prices and commuting (which implicitly also relies on Rosen, 1986). For certain 
5:89:7124:28:27:72:544:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:relatively  simple  spatial  structures  of  cities  with  well-defined  workplace  centres,  such  as  Hong  
5:90:7234:27:28:72:544:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Kong,  this  method  seems  promising  (see  Tse  and  Chan  (2003)  and  Yiu  and  Tam  (2007)).  For  
5:91:7338:28:27:72:536:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:complex urban structures, such as in the Netherlands, application of this method seems difficult. 
5:92:7436:27:26:107:543:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:In this paper, we estimate commuting costs based on actual on-the-job search, as well as 
5:93:7525:26:8:72:219:270:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
5:94:7583:8:24:72:543:262:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:3 In addition to monetary and time commuting cost, there are other cost components. For example, given 
5:95:7686:24:19:72:544:238:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:the  presence  of  a  car  in  the  household,  the  use  of  the  car  for  commuting  imposes  opportunity  costs  on  
5:96:7807:19:19:72:544:219:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:other  members  within  the  same  household  who  do  not  have  simultaneous  access  to  the  use  of  the  car.  
5:97:7924:19:19:72:544:200:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:There  is  also  a  large  literature  in  psychology  that  suggests  that  the  psychological  costs  of  travel  are

5:99:8158:19:19:72:542:162:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:pressure, physical disorders and anxiety. Further, long commutes are thought to have adverse effects on a 
5:100:8264:19:18:72:543:143:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:worker's  mood,  as  well  as  on  cognitive  performance.  Economics  literature  on  the  psychological  costs  of  
5:101:8382:18:19:72:544:125:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:commuting  indicates  that  these  costs  are  relevant  (Kahneman  et  al.,  2004;  Stutzer  and  Frey,  2004).  As  
5:102:8500:19:19:72:543:106:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:most  of  the  psychological  costs  of  travel  increase  with  travel  time,  it  is  not  necessary  to  deal  with  these  
5:103:8627:19:0:72:147:87:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:costs separately.

6:105:8750:28:28:71:544:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:search and job moving behaviour, employing a dynamic job search approach.4 Our paper relates 
6:106:8843:28:27:72:543:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:to a number of studies that have estimated the implied  value  of  job  attributes  using  data  on  job  
6:107:8949:27:28:72:543:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:moving behaviour (Herzog and Schlottmann, 1990; Gronberg and Reed, 1994; Manning, 2003b; 
6:108:9038:28:27:72:545:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Dale-Olsen,  2006)  and  job  search  behaviour  (Van  Ommeren  and  Hazans,  2008).5 It is also 
6:109:9135:27:28:71:544:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:loosely  related  to  the  approach  introduced  by  Bartik  et  al.  (1992)  who  estimated  the  value  of  
6:110:9245:28:28:71:391:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:residential characteristics based on residential moving behaviour.  
6:111:9312:28:27:107:547:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:The  dynamic  job  search  approach  assumes  that  workers  are  not  in  their  preferred  
6:112:9405:27:28:71:543:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:(welfare-maximising) job due to imperfect information about other jobs, but workers are able to 
6:113:9501:28:27:71:543:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:improve their welfare over time by searching for other jobs, and by moving to other jobs if a job 
6:114:9599:27:28:71:544:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:is  found  that  increases  welfare.  This  approach  uses  the  implicit  trade  off  between  commuting  
6:115:9706:28:28:71:544:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:time  and  wage,  which  affects  both  on-the-job-search  and  job  moving  behaviour,  to  determine  
6:116:9810:28:25:71:239:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:workers' marginal costs of travel.6 
6:117:9845:25:13:72:542:353:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                                                                                                                                                           
6:118:10031:13:14:72:75:340:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F: 
6:119:10031:14:24:72:544:326:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:4  This  approach  avoids  some  strong  assumptions  underlying  discrete  choice-based  estimates  based  on  
6:120:10143:24:19:72:544:302:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:actual  route  or  mode  choices,  including  the  assumption  that  the  choice  set  of  the  worker  is  accurately  
6:121:10263:19:19:72:543:283:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:observed, and that the characteristics of the travel alternatives not chosen by the commuter are accurately 
6:122:10371:19:19:72:543:264:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:observed. It also avoids the fundamental assumption, common in transport studies, that a change in mode 
6:123:10475:19:19:72:543:245:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:affects only the costs and times associated with these modes. Such an assumption may be very restrictive, 
6:124:10581:19:14:72:465:226:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:as it ignores, for example, changes in convenience (see, e.g., Calfee and Winston, 1998). 
6:125:10671:14:24:72:483:212:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:5 Isacsson and Swärdh (2007) estimate the value of commuting time based on the duration of 
6:126:10762:24:14:72:514:188:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:employment, using strong assumptions regarding the choice of transport mode and the related costs. 
6:127:10861:14:24:72:543:174:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:6  The  reader  may  wonder  whether  a  method  that  relies  on  the  trade  off  between  wages  and  commuting  
6:128:10977:24:19:72:545:150:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:time,  and  therefore  measures  the  long-run  marginal  costs  of  commuting,  generates  results  that  are  
6:129:11089:19:19:72:543:131:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:comparable to methods, common in transport economics, that measure the short-run marginal costs of the 
6:130:11192:19:19:72:543:112:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:time component. At least theoretically, the answer is yes. One of the standard micro-economics results is 
6:131:11298:19:19:72:543:93:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:that  long-run  and  short-run  marginal  costs  are  equal  (because  the  long-run  and  short-run  average  curves  
6:132:11417:19:0:72:433:74:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:are tangent, see Varian, 1992). Our dynamic search model has the same property. 
7:133:11498:0:28:107:544:710:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Our  study  is  related  to  studies  that  focus  on  the  compensation  workers  receive,  in  the  
7:134:11600:28:28:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:labour  market,  for  commuting  (e.g.,  Zax,  1991;  Van  Ommeren  et  al.,  2000;  Manning,  2003a;  
7:135:11703:28:27:72:546:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Van  Ommeren  and  Hazans,  2008).  Typically,  these  studies  use  either  commuting  time  or  
7:136:11801:27:28:72:546:627:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:B:distance  as  an  approximation  for  commuting  costs.  This  is  not  justified,  but  is  seen  as  a  
7:137:11907:28:27:72:544:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:restriction of the available data set. Intuitively, if commuting costs mainly consist of time costs, 
7:138:12008:27:28:72:543:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:then the use of commuting time is preferred. On the other hand, if there exist large (unobserved) 
7:139:12106:28:28:72:546:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:differences  in  speed,  for  example  due  to  congestion,  then  commuting  distance  may  be  the  
7:140:12208:28:27:72:544:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:preferred  measure.  The  two  measures  are  equivalent  only  if  the  commuting  speed  is  fixed  and  
7:141:12315:27:28:72:543:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:constant across the population. In the current paper, we apply a dynamic search model approach, 
7:142:12411:28:27:72:544:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:and  measure  commuting  costs  based  on  commuting  time.  The  use  of  commuting  time,  when  
7:143:12510:27:28:72:543:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:commuting distance is not observed, will be justified theoretically by allowing for endogenously 
7:144:12607:28:28:72:462:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:B:chosen speed. Hence, we will measure the costs of commuting in terms of time.7 
7:145:12685:28:27:107:543:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Although the dynamic search model approach has a number of fundamental advantages, 
7:146:12768:27:28:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:it has also a number of disadvantages (Gronberg and Reed, 1994; Manning, 2003b). One of the 
7:147:12860:28:27:72:543:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:main drawbacks of the dynamic search model approach is that one must assume identical utility 
7:148:12954:27:28:72:543:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:functions across workers, and the literature remains suspicious as to what extent this assumption 
7:149:13052:28:28:72:543:268:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:biases the results (e.g., see the seminal paper by Gronberg and Reed, 1994). This criticism can be 
7:150:13151:28:27:72:544:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:(partially) addressed by means of panel data techniques; these techniques have not been applied 
7:151:13247:27:28:72:543:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:previously in this context. In the current paper, we will show that the results remain robust, using 
7:152:13348:28:27:72:181:185:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:panel data techniques. 
7:153:13371:27:28:107:543:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Note that although we are aware of various studies that use either the job mobility or the 
7:154:13462:28:8:72:219:130:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
7:155:13520:8:24:72:545:122:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:7  We  believe  that  such  a  measure  is  generally  more  useful  than  a  measure  in  terms  of  distance,  for  
7:156:13638:24:19:71:543:98:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:international comparisons. One notable characteristic of commuting time (and not of distance) is that the 
7:157:13744:19:0:71:517:79:121:g_d0_f7:121:Times:F:nationwide average commuting time is hardly time-varying (see Van Ommeren and Rietveld, 2005). 
8:158:13839:0:28:72:542:710:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:B:job search approach to estimate the value of job attributes, this is the first study that applies both 
8:159:13942:28:28:72:543:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:approaches  to  the  same  data  set.  Both  approaches  rely  on  the  same  underlying  dynamic  search  
8:160:14049:28:27:71:546:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:model,  so  they  should  (if  applied  correctly)  generate  the  same  estimate  of  the  value  of  job  
8:161:14157:27:28:72:543:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:attributes. Another potential advantage is to estimate joint models of job search and mobility. In 
8:162:14256:28:27:72:545:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:our  application,  though,  it  turns  out  that  joint  models  of  job  search  and  mobility  generate  
8:163:14363:27:28:72:543:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:identical results to separate models of job search and mobility, without any gain in the efficiency 
8:164:14463:28:28:72:543:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:of the estimates. Throughout the paper, we will provide the results for the separate models, and, 
8:165:14561:28:27:72:520:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:discuss soon the estimates of the joint model, when discussing the robustness of the analysis. 
8:166:14655:27:28:107:543:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Although the underlying assumptions of the search and mobility approaches are the same, 
8:167:14743:28:27:71:543:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:the job search approach is easier to apply, since the job mobility approach requires information 
8:168:14840:27:28:71:545:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:on  voluntary  job  mobility  –  information  that  is  frequently  not  available  in  surveys.  One  may  
8:169:14948:28:28:71:544:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:avoid  this  issue  by  making  the  additional  assumption  that  the  job  attribute  does  not  affect  the  
8:170:15060:28:27:71:542:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:involuntary job-quitting rate (see Van Ommeren and Hazans (2008) for details). In the context of 
8:171:15157:27:28:71:543:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:our  study,  this  does  not  turn  out  to  be  problematic,  because  it  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  
8:172:15270:28:27:71:546:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:the  length  of  the  commute  does  not  affect  the  involuntary  job-quitting  rate.  Hence,  given  
8:173:15374:27:28:71:543:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:estimates  from  both  approaches,  we  are  able  to  test  whether  the  two  approaches  are  consistent  
8:174:15483:28:28:71:544:268:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:with each other in their empirical implementation. Given consistency, estimates of the different 
8:175:15580:28:27:71:518:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:approaches can be pooled, enabling one to reduce the standard errors of the pooled estimate. 
8:176:15673:27:28:107:545:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:The  outline  of  the  paper  is  as  follows.  In  section  2,  we  introduce  a  job  search  model  
8:177:15776:28:27:71:544:185:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:(allowing  for  commuting  costs),  specify  the  appropriate  utility  function,  and  derive  workers'

8:179:15978:28:28:71:232:130:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:3. Section 4 concludes the paper.

9:182:16034:0:27:72:191:709:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:?:2.1 Short-run behaviour 
9:183:16058:27:28:72:543:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Consider an employed individual who lives forever. In the short run, the worker’s residence and 
9:184:16154:28:27:72:543:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:workplace  locations,  and  therefore  the  commuting  distance  D,  are  exogenously  given.  Also,  in  
9:185:16260:27:28:71:543:627:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:the short run, she derives utility from job attributes X by the quasi-concave instantaneous utility 
9:186:16360:28:27:72:543:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:function v(X). The estimation method we use to estimate workers' value of job attributes applies 
9:187:16457:27:28:72:542:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:to any quasi-concave utility function v(X). However, in the context of commuting, for estimation 
9:188:16554:28:28:72:408:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:and interpretation purposes, it is useful to specify v(X) in more detail. 
9:189:16628:28:27:108:543:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:We assume that v(X) = v(Y,L), where Y is income and L denotes leisure time. Income Y 
9:190:16713:27:30:72:542:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:is equal to wH-c, where w is the hourly wage, H is the number of hours worked and c denotes the 
9:191:16809:30:28:72:545:459:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:monetary  commuting  costs.8  Leisure  time  is  equal  to  LHt−−,  where  L  is  the  total  time

9:193:17012:27:28:72:403:404:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:commuting time t, as well as hours of work H, are optimally chosen. 
9:194:17080:28:27:107:542:376:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:We consider commuting distance to be produced according to the production function d, 
9:195:17166:27:28:71:542:349:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:which takes money and travel time as inputs. We assume that this production function is strictly 
9:196:17263:28:28:71:543:321:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:increasing and strictly concave, such that the isoquants are strictly convex. Since the commuting

10:210:18543:29:28:72:543:680:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:Together, these first-order conditions imply that wdc=dt. Further, it appears that, by the envelope

10:231:19715:28:28:72:546:296:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:interpreted  as  the  total  marginal  costs  of  commuting  associated  with  commuting  time.  It  
10:232:19816:28:27:72:544:268:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:measures the increase in wage that is necessary to compensate for an optimally-chosen increase

10:235:20112:28:25:72:542:185:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:(2), this measure exceeds the MWP for commuting time that ignores monetary commuting costs.

11:245:20937:28:27:72:543:542:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:fact that the choice of how to go to work, and hence the time and cost, involves, in general, much 
11:246:21036:27:28:72:545:515:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:more  than  a  simple  discrete-mode  choice.  There  are  a  multitude  of  choices  –  including  some  
11:247:21142:28:28:72:542:487:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:continuous choices. Consider, e.g., the possibilities for combining different modes (Van Exel and

11:249:21340:27:28:72:544:432:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:between  slow  and  fast  routes,  car  drivers  choosing  speed  and  driving  style,  choosing  between  
11:250:21447:28:27:72:545:404:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:cars  with  different  costs,  etc.  (Rouwendal,  1996;  Rienstra  and  Rietveld,  1996;  Verhoef  and  
11:251:21551:27:29:72:543:377:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:Rouwendal, 2001; Gander, 1985; Rotemberg, 1985). It should be noted, however, that the result 
11:252:21645:29:28:72:544:348:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that -MWP=αw/H>w/H may  also  be  derived  under  the  antithetical  assumption  that  commuting

11:254:21838:28:28:72:543:292:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:increase in distance.12 Thus the analysis in this paper remains valid also for this case where the 
11:255:21937:28:27:72:448:264:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:commuter is restricted to just one transport mode with a given cost and speed.

11:259:22408:24:19:71:542:136:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:These conditions imply convexity and hence are stronger. Proof of these assertions is available from the

11:261:22536:14:24:72:529:103:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:12 This is easy to show, using the same argument as above. We require that cost and time are increasing

12:264:22786:29:27:72:542:680:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:utility depends on the daily wage wH, as well as on the interaction between the hourly wage w 
12:265:22878:27:28:71:544:653:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and  the  commuting  time t.  Our  main  interest  is  to  estimate  the  unknown  coefficient  α,  as  it  
12:266:22985:28:28:71:544:625:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:determines workers' MWP, given information on H and w. We will see now that the MWP can 
12:267:23073:28:27:71:523:597:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:be derived from both observations of on-the-job search and from observations of job moving.

12:283:24547:28:26:72:543:154:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:utility and the expected benefit of accepting a job offer during the next time period. It is assumed 
12:284:24648:26:7:72:219:128:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
12:285:24706:7:7:72:165:121:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:13 Note that ∂v/∂w=v
12:286:24726:7:18:164:543:114:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:YH and [∂v/∂D]/tD=-vYwα, so v=v(wH-αwt) is consistent with these first-derivatives. 
12:287:24810:18:19:72:542:96:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:Note further that v(wH-αwt) represents the same preferences as, for example, v(log(wH-αwt)), where log 
12:288:24912:19:0:71:370:77:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:denotes the natural logarithm. This issue will be addressed later on.

13:295:25275:27:28:71:543:540:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:interpretation  of  this  formula  is  well  known  (see,  e.g.,  Mortensen,  1986).  Current  utility  equals

13:298:25588:28:28:71:229:457:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:job offer only if V(X0)-V(X) > 0. 
13:299:25622:28:27:72:544:429:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:  The  optimal-choice  search  decision  is  obtained  by  maximising  (2),  with  respect  to  s.  It  
13:300:25726:27:28:72:186:402:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:can easily be seen that:

13:306:25889:28:28:108:542:232:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:In the previous subsection, we have shown that X includes two job attributes: the wage w 
13:307:25977:28:27:71:544:204:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:as  well  as  the  commuting  time  t.  Workers'  MWP  for  commuting  time  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  
13:308:26087:27:29:71:543:177:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the marginal instantaneous utility of commuting time t over the marginal instantaneous utility of 
13:309:26185:29:28:71:543:148:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:wage w, so MWP = [∂v(X)/∂D.tD-1]/[∂v(X)/∂w]. Note that k and p are not observed, and (4) can 
13:310:26278:28:0:72:543:120:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:be rewritten as s = 1 if Emax[V(X0)-V(X),0] ≥ k/p, so k/p can be considered (unobserved) random

14:324:26663:27:28:71:543:527:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:workers' MWP is equal to the ratio of the marginal effects of commuting time and wage on the 
14:325:26756:28:27:71:542:499:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:probability of job search. This result is intuitive: commuting time and wage both affect the utility 
14:326:26857:27:28:71:544:472:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:of the worker. Workers use the trade-off between commuting time and wage to determine their 
14:327:26949:28:28:71:323:444:145:g_d0_f7:100:Helvetica:B:optimal search – and therefore moving – behaviour.

14:330:27202:28:27:71:543:361:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:offer will be accepted. In our application, as is quite common, we only observe if at least one job 
14:331:27302:27:28:71:546:334:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:move  occurs  during  a  fixed  time  interval  (in  our  application,  two  years).  So,  it  is  more  
14:332:27407:28:28:71:545:306:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:straightforward  to  use  the  job  moving  probability,  for  a  fixed  interval,  than  the  job-moving

14:339:28018:19:24:72:542:141:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:15 The job moving rate θ is defined, in the theoretical model, for an infinitely small period. With respect to

17:404:31343:28:27:72:543:654:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:We have seen that workers' valuation of commuting time can be derived from data on job search,

17:406:31532:28:27:71:544:599:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:models are similar, but not identical. Job search behaviour relates to an activity, which may, or 
17:407:31630:27:28:71:544:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:may not, result in a job move. Job moving is usually preceded by a job search activity (but not 
17:408:31726:28:28:71:543:544:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:always, as employers also approach workers, see Mekkelholt, 1993), but this job search activity 
17:409:31822:28:27:71:543:516:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:will frequently not be recorded in the survey available to the analyst (as it falls outside the search 
17:410:31925:27:28:71:221:489:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:period defined by the survey).

17:413:32145:28:28:71:543:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:so one has to observe a worker at least twice. This implies that there is usually less information 
17:414:32244:28:27:71:271:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:about job mobility than about job search. 
17:415:32286:27:28:107:544:351:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A:Our  data  derive  from  the  biannual  Dutch  labour  supply  panel  survey  (OSA).  We  select

17:419:32691:28:27:71:544:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:job  moving,  we  use  information  about  workers  observed  in  the  consecutive  surveys.  We  have  
17:420:32795:27:28:71:543:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:9,513 valid observations on job moving for 4,544 different workers. The mean net hourly wage 
17:421:32888:28:27:71:543:185:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:in our sample is € 9.17. For males, the mean net wage is € 9.57, whereas for females the mean 
17:422:32982:27:28:71:167:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:net wage is € 8.61.

17:424:33103:28:27:71:543:102:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:weekly number of hours). From other data sources (WBO, 2002), we find the national mean of 
17:425:33194:27:0:71:544:75:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:daily  working  hours,  which  is  7.8  for  males,  6.0  for  females  and  7.0  for  the  whole  sample.  In  
18:426:33308:0:28:72:544:710:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:particular,  for  males  the  variation  in  daily  working  hours  is  small,  but,  also,  for  females  this  
18:427:33421:28:28:71:544:682:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:B:variation  is  small,  with  few  female  workers  working  less  than  5  or  more  than  8  hours  (see

18:440:34617:7:24:72:543:312:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:16 Note that random measurement error in the number of hours worked per day induces a downward bias

18:442:34824:19:19:71:543:269:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:is observed with error, and the hourly wage w, which is observed, so we therefore assume to be observed 
18:443:34928:19:22:71:542:250:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:without measurement error. In this case, the bias in the estimated βw (as a proportion of the true value) is 
18:444:35037:22:22:72:543:228:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:equal  to  222/()HHwσσσ+  approximately,  where  2Hσ  and  2wσ  refer  to  the  variances  of  hours  and  wage,

18:447:35376:25:23:71:544:159:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:(2002), 2Hσ  =  0.83  (0.64  for  males;  1.04  for  females).  Hence,  the  bias  is  only  8.5%  of  the  true  value  
18:448:35497:23:19:72:543:136:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:(6.4% for males; 12% for females). As we control for other variables, it is plausible that the bias is less; 
18:449:35606:19:19:72:542:117:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:we control for the presence of a partner, children, and industry, which likely strongly reduces unobserved

19:453:35937:28:28:71:269:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:are statistically quite different concepts.

19:463:36623:28:28:72:542:406:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:results based on a standard probit and random-effects probit model. In the standard probit model, 
19:464:36721:28:27:72:544:378:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the  panel  structure  of  the  data  is  ignored.  However,  it  may  be  the  case  that  some  workers  are  
19:465:36833:27:28:72:543:351:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:more  likely  to  search,  for  reasons  not  included  in  the  model.  This  is  potentially  problematic  as  
19:466:36946:28:27:72:544:323:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the  theoretical  model  assumes  homogeneous  individuals.  For  this  reason,  we  also  estimate  a

19:471:37444:28:27:72:543:185:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:so, essentially, the same result is obtained. This suggests that the empirical results, obtained for a 
19:472:37547:27:0:71:542:158:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:sample of heterogeneous workers, are not so sensitive to the assumption of homogeneity. This is 
20:473:37645:0:28:72:542:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:important  because  the  dynamic  search  approach,  and  therefore  the  derivation  of  MCC/w, 
20:474:37742:28:28:71:341:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:assumes that workers have identical utility functions.17  
20:475:37800:28:27:107:544:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:We  find  that,  at  the  margin,  workers'  costs  associated  with  commuting  time  are  about

20:481:38375:28:29:72:543:488:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:for males, βw = -0.0052 and βh = 0.0074, so the value of MCC/w = 1.41(standard error = 0.48). In 
20:482:38472:29:27:72:543:459:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the  random  effects  model,  for  males,  we  find  MCC/w  =  1.43.  For  females,  MCC/w  is  equal  to  
20:483:38579:27:28:72:543:432:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:2.24 and 2.25, respectively.19 These estimates imply that workers' MCC is around € 14 for males 
20:484:38675:28:27:71:544:404:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and  around  €  19  for  females,  suggesting  that  the  MCC  is  higher  for  females  than  for  males.  
20:485:38783:27:39:72:496:377:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:However, the difference in these estimates is statistically insignificant at the 5% level.20 
20:486:38875:39:7:72:219:338:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
20:487:38933:7:24:72:543:331:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:17 We have also estimated worker fixed-effects logit models, which identify the coefficients of interest by 
20:488:39041:24:19:72:548:307:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:controlling   for   unobserved   worker   characteristics,   so   the   homogeneity   assumption   is   even   less   
20:489:39159:19:19:72:542:288:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:problematic.  However,  given  fixed  effects,  there  is  too  little  variation  in  the  data  to  estimate  βt/βw 
20:490:39276:19:19:71:543:269:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:precisely, because the standard error of βt is large, relative to its point estimate (t = 0.740). However, the 
20:491:39387:19:14:71:274:250:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:point estimate has the correct sign (negative). 
20:492:39435:14:19:72:433:236:49:g_d0_f7:121:Times:F:18 The standard error is calculated using the delta method, see Goldberger (1991). 
20:493:39517:19:24:72:543:217:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:19 Note that measurement error in the number of daily working hours, H, is more present for females than 
20:494:39622:24:19:71:543:193:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:for  males  (for  whom  variation  in  H  is  much  smaller).  Random  measurement  error  in  H  decreases  the  
20:495:39736:19:19:71:546:174:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:estimate  of  βw.  This  suggests  that  the  larger  value  of  MCC  for  females  may  be  partially  due  to  
20:496:39849:19:19:71:542:155:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:measurement error in H. Our investigation of this issue, based on data for job mobility, as discussed later 
20:497:39957:19:14:71:322:136:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:on, suggests however that this is not, or hardly, the case. 
20:498:40017:14:24:72:543:122:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:20 The (weighted) average of these gender-specific estimates is € 15.40, so the (weighted) average of the 
20:499:40123:24:19:71:542:98:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:models, estimated separately for gender, is (slightly) lower than the point estimate of the model, based on 
20:500:40231:19:0:71:181:79:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:the pooled observations. 
21:501:40258:0:28:107:544:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:According  to  the  labour  economics  literature,  it  is  plausible  that  females  with  children  
21:502:40360:28:28:72:544:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and  an  employed  (male)  partner  have  higher  MCC  (e.g.,  Wales,  1978).  The  main  reason  is  that  
21:503:40468:28:27:72:544:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:these females have a higher value of non-working time. This is consistent with the stylised fact 
21:504:40565:27:28:72:543:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that  females  with  children  and  an  employed  husband  are  less  likely  to  work  and,  if  they  work,  
21:505:40676:28:27:72:542:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:they are more likely to work part-time. We have therefore re-estimated the same model, based on 
21:506:40772:27:28:72:544:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:a  sample  of  females  with  children  (and  with  an  employed  partner)(see  Table  3).  We  find  that  
21:507:40880:28:28:72:545:544:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:MCC/w  is  3.35  (with  a  standard  error  of  1.18).  So,  in  line  with  this  hypothesis,  the  MCC  is  
21:508:40990:28:27:72:543:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:substantially higher for this group, but the estimate is rather imprecise due to the limited number 
21:509:41090:27:28:72:543:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:of observations. We have therefore re-examined this result by estimating the same model for the 
21:510:41186:28:27:72:544:461:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:whole  sample,  and  including  interaction  effects  for  females  with  children.  According  to  these  
21:511:41293:27:28:72:545:434:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:results,  the  MCC/w  for  this  group  of  females  is  about  50%  larger,  but  this  difference  is  not  
21:512:41403:28:28:72:543:406:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:statistically different. Hence, our results suggest that the MCC of this group is in the range of € 9 
21:513:41505:28:27:72:114:378:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:to € 30.

21:516:41535:27:28:72:543:296:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:We have also estimated models of job mobility, in order to estimate ηt and ηw. The full results are 
21:517:41635:28:28:71:543:268:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:given in Tables 5 and 6, and summarised in Table 7. In essence, the results are the same as for 
21:518:41731:28:27:71:544:240:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:on-the-job  search.  Estimates  of  MCC  vary  from  between  €  13  and  €17.  Again,  allowing  for  
21:519:41834:27:28:71:543:213:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:worker-specific unobserved heterogeneity does not change the results. The only difference is that 
21:520:41932:28:27:71:544:185:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the  results  based  on  mobility  data  suggest  that  females  have  a  slightly  lower  MCC  than  males,  
21:521:42042:27:28:71:542:158:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:but this difference is far from statistically significant. Similar to the results for on-the-job search, 
21:522:42147:28:28:71:543:130:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:we  have  also  examined  whether  females  with  children  and  an  employed  partner  have  a  higher  
21:523:42252:28:27:72:523:102:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:MCC. This appears to be the case, but the difference is far from being statistically significant.

22:526:42403:27:28:72:547:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:We   have   estimated   separate   models   using   information   on   on-the-job   search   as   well   as   
22:527:42513:28:27:72:545:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:information  on  job  moving  behaviour.  Both  models  give  information  on  the  size  of  MCC.  It  
22:528:42617:27:28:72:544:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:appears  that  the  difference  in  the  MCC  estimates  of  the  job  search  and  job  mobility  models  is  
22:529:42728:28:27:71:544:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:small  and  statistically  insignificant.  For  example,  given  the  model  where  observations  of  males  
22:530:42837:27:28:71:544:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and females are pooled, the difference in the estimates is € -2.19  for the standard probit model 
22:531:42935:28:28:71:542:544:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and € -2.21  for the random-effects probit model. Hence, the estimates based on the job search 
22:532:43029:28:27:71:543:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and job-moving approaches are consistent with each other, and differ only due to random error. 
22:533:43124:27:28:72:543:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:The  mean  size  effect  can  therefore  be  calculated  by  the  weighted  average  of  the  two  estimates,  
22:534:43235:28:27:72:543:461:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:where  the  weights  are  based  on  the  inverse  of  the  variance  of  the  estimates.21  The  mean  effect  
22:535:43347:27:28:72:544:434:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:based  on  the  standard  probit  models  is  €17.09  with  a  standard  error  of  €  2.31,  whereas  for  the

22:537:43571:28:27:72:543:378:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:before, a one standard-deviation increase in the commuting time increases the MCC by about €

22:539:43667:28:27:107:543:323:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Using the same methodology but distinguishing now between females with children (and 
22:540:43752:27:28:71:545:296:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:an  employed  husband)  and  the  rest  of  the  sample,  we  find  that  the  MCC  for  females  with  
22:541:43856:28:28:72:544:268:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:children  is  €  18.46  (s.e.  2.71)  and  for  the  rest  of  the  sample  is  €  15.68  (s.e.  2.36).  Hence,  the  
22:542:43974:28:27:72:544:240:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:results  suggest  that  females  with  children  have  a  higher  MCC  than  other  workers,  but  a  larger  
22:543:44084:27:28:72:543:213:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:sample of observations is needed to clarify this issue, as the difference between these estimates is

23:547:44242:0:28:72:542:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:We have repeated the analyses many times with different sets of control variables, and found that 
23:548:44340:28:28:72:544:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the  results  remain  robust.22  We  have  also  re-estimated  models  for  observations  for  a  selected  
23:549:44448:28:27:71:543:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:range of the reported hourly  wage,  to  reduce  potential  measurement error in the reported wage. 
23:550:44548:27:28:72:544:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:The  results  remain  robust.  Furthermore,  we  have  re-examined  the  functional  form  of  the  two  
23:551:44653:28:27:72:545:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:main  variables  of  interest:  the  daily  wage  wH  and  the  commuting  time  t.  Recall  that  theory  
23:552:44760:27:29:71:542:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:suggested that v = v(wH-αwt), so, in the empirical specification of the model, wH as well as wt 
23:553:44855:29:29:71:543:543:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:have been used. Note, however, that v(wH-αwt) represents the same preferences as, for example, 
23:554:44950:29:30:72:544:514:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:v(log(wH-αwt)),  where  log  denotes  the  natural  logarithm.  The  latter  can  be  approximated  by  
23:555:45054:30:28:72:545:484:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:v(log(wH)-αt/H),  for  αt/H  much  smaller  than  one.  The  latter  approximation  amounts  to  the  
23:556:45156:28:28:72:547:456:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:assumption  that  daily  commuting  costs  are  small,  relative  to  the  daily  wage.  Hence,  the  
23:557:45258:28:27:72:546:428:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:instantaneous  utility  depends,  then,  on  the  logarithm  of  the  daily  wage  and  the  level  of  
23:558:45362:27:28:72:544:401:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:commuting  time  (relative  to  the  number  of  working  hours  H).  Hence,  we  have  re-estimated  all  
23:559:45469:28:28:72:543:373:145:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:B:models using a specification based on the logarithm of the daily wage and the level of commuting 
23:560:45566:28:27:71:543:345:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:time, as well as models that include the daily wage, the logarithm of the wage, commuting time

23:563:45940:7:24:72:543:285:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:21  These  weights  are  optimal  when  the  difference  in  the  estimates  is  entirely  due  to  random  error.  The  
23:564:46061:24:14:71:523:261:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:standard error of this mean is computed as the square root of the sum of the inverse variance weights.  
23:565:46165:14:24:72:543:247:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:22 We have excluded a range of regressors, as well as included additional regressors such as elapsed job

23:567:46393:19:19:71:546:204:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:search  model  control  for  two  types  of  confounding  effects:  firstly,  workers  face  different  wage  
23:568:46503:19:19:71:543:185:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:distributions,  and,  depending  on  the  level  of  the  current  wage  relative  to  the  expected  wage  of  the  new  
23:569:46625:19:19:71:542:166:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:job, they will decide to search; secondly, workers face different arrival rates p(s), even for the same level 
23:570:46735:19:19:71:544:147:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:of  search  effort,  which  will  affect  their  search  decision.  Hence,  each  control  variable  controls  both  for  
23:571:46857:19:19:71:543:128:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:differences in the wage distribution and for differences in the job arrival rates. To address this issue, we 
23:572:46966:19:0:71:544:109:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:have  estimated  a  standard  hedonic  wage  model  and  have  used  the  difference  between  the  observed  and  
24:573:47083:0:28:72:543:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:at the mean, are systematically larger (about 10% to 32% in absolute value) than reported above, 
24:574:47180:28:28:71:543:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:but these new point estimates are all within the 95% confidence interval of the results presented 
24:575:47278:28:27:71:545:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:above.  We  have  compared  the  fitness  criteria  of  the  estimated  models  with  those  reported  in  
24:576:47385:27:28:71:330:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:section 3.2, but the fitness criteria are very similar.23  
24:577:47444:28:27:108:543:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A: Finally, we have estimated bivariate probit models, which allow for correlation between 
24:578:47533:27:28:72:543:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the unobserved error terms in the two equations for job search and job moving. It appears that the 
24:579:47632:28:28:72:543:544:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:results are almost identical: workers' MCC changes only slightly, whereas the standard errors are 
24:580:47730:28:27:72:544:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:hardly  reduced.  In  conclusion,  our  results  are  robust,  and  we  have  reported  the  point  estimates  
24:581:47841:27:28:72:229:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that are the most conservative.24 
24:582:47874:28:27:107:543:461:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Our estimates for α are lower than the implied value obtained by Manning (2003a) using 
24:583:47961:27:28:72:543:434:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:information on on-the-job mobility in the U.K.25 Our point estimates, however, exceed the point 
24:584:48057:28:30:71:544:406:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:estimates  obtained  by  Van  Ommeren  and  Hazans  (2008)  using  information  on  job  search  for  
24:585:48159:30:12:72:542:376:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                                                                                                                                                           
24:586:48345:12:19:72:542:364:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:the expected wage, viz. the residuals of the hedonic wage model, instead of the observed wage. It appears 
24:587:48451:19:14:72:231:345:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:that the results are almost identical. 
24:588:48490:14:24:72:543:331:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:23 For most models, the fitness criteria are slightly better for the model specification reported in the tables 
24:589:48602:24:19:71:545:307:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:above  than  for  the  alternative  specification.  It  appears  however  that  the  alternative  specification  is  
24:590:48719:19:14:72:255:288:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:consistently less appropriate for females. 
24:591:48762:14:24:72:544:274:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:24  We  have  found  that  estimates  of  workers'  MCC  are  about  €17  per  hour.  Our  findings,  therefore,  
24:592:48876:24:19:71:544:250:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:indicate  that  the  costs  associated  with  commuting  are  substantial.  It  is  plausible  that  workers  will  be  
24:593:48996:19:19:71:544:231:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:compensated  in  the  labour  and/or  housing  market.  In  case  of  full  compensation  (via  higher  wages  and  
24:594:49112:19:19:71:544:212:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:house  prices),  commuting  time  should  not  have  any  effect  on  on-the-job  activity  or  on-the-job  mobility  
24:595:49230:19:19:71:543:193:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f7:F:when  one  does  not  control  for  wages  and  house  prices  (Manning,  2003a).  Indeed,  estimates  not  shown  
24:596:49345:19:19:71:542:174:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:here imply that on-the-job search activity, as well as job mobility, strongly increase with commuting time, 
24:597:49453:19:19:71:542:155:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:when  one  does  not  control  for  wages  (and  house  prices).  So,  on  average,  workers  are  partially 
24:598:49561:19:19:71:542:136:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:compensated for their commuting costs. This result is in line with the common result: that estimates based 
24:599:49668:19:14:71:536:117:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:on hedonic wage models find that wages are not so responsive to the length of workers' commuting time. 
24:600:49771:14:24:72:545:103:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:25  Our  estimates  are  also  lower  than  those  obtained  by  Stutzer  and  Frey  (2004),  who  estimate,  for  
24:601:49886:24:0:71:407:79:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:Germany, that α is equal to 0.4, using subjective information on well being. 
25:602:49965:0:28:72:542:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:Lithuania. In Van Ommeren and Hazans (2008), it was argued that to determine a worker's value 
25:603:50059:28:28:72:544:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:of  job  attributes  via  information  on  job  search  would  be  more  accurate  than  using  information  
25:604:50168:28:27:72:546:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:about  job  mobility.  In  particular,  it  was  argued  that  if  the  job  attribute  was  correlated  to  
25:605:50277:27:28:72:542:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:involuntary job mobility, then the use of information on job mobility will bias the results. In that 
25:606:50378:28:27:72:544:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:study,  the  authors  suggested  that  the  relative  high  value  for  α,  obtained  by  Manning  (2003a),  
25:607:50487:27:28:72:544:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:may  be  due  to  the  use  of  job  mobility  data  (instead  of  job  search  data).  Since  we  find  almost  
25:608:50600:28:28:72:545:544:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:identical  results  for  α in  our  study,  given  information  about  job  mobility  and  job  search,  it  
25:609:50708:28:27:71:544:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:appears  that,  at  least  in  the  case  of  commuting  time,  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  with  
25:610:50818:27:28:71:544:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:respect  to  the  choice  of  analysing  job  search  or  job  move  data.  We  do  not  have  an  explanation  
25:611:50930:28:27:71:545:461:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:why  our  estimates  are  in  between  those  of  Manning  (2003a)  and  Van  Ommeren  and  Hazans  
25:612:51030:27:28:71:544:434:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:(2008),  although  it  should  be  emphasised  that  those  studies  focus  on  the  U.K.  and  Lithuania,  
25:613:51138:28:28:71:135:406:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:respectively. 
25:614:51152:28:27:107:543:378:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Our findings are not so straightforward as to compare with those of transport studies that 
25:615:51243:27:28:71:543:351:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:focus  on  the  time  component  of  commuting  costs.  In  that  literature,  it  is  hotly  debated  whether  
25:616:51355:28:27:71:543:323:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:time costs are small or large, relative to the wage rate. A usual finding is that the disutility of one 
25:617:51459:27:28:71:543:296:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:hour of commuting is less than the net gross hourly wage (Small, 1992).26 Our estimates indicate 
25:618:51556:28:28:71:543:268:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that the overall marginal costs of commuting are about twice the net wage, suggesting that other 
25:619:51653:28:27:72:522:240:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:costs (monetary costs, opportunity costs of car use, etc.) play an important role at the margin.

25:621:51750:28:27:259:355:185:144:Times:144:Times:E:4. CONCLUSION 
25:622:51764:27:28:72:545:158:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:In  this  paper,  we  have  estimated  workers'  marginal  costs  associated  with  the  length  of  the  
25:623:51870:28:0:72:545:130:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:commute.  We  have  argued,  in  the  introduction,  that  these  costs  play  an  important  role  in  
26:624:51976:0:28:72:545:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:economic  theory  regarding  the  spatial  structure  of  the  economy.  Perhaps  surprisingly,  there  is  
26:625:52084:28:28:72:543:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:little known about the level of these costs. We used a dynamic model approach, which allows us 
26:626:52179:28:27:72:545:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:to  estimate  the  total  marginal  costs  associated  with  commuting  time.  The  approach  has  been  
26:627:52284:27:28:72:543:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:applied to observations on job moving, as well as job search, behaviour in the Netherlands, using 
26:628:52382:28:27:72:542:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:panel data. The application of panel data approaches partially addresses one of the limitations of 
26:629:52481:27:28:72:542:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:the dynamic model approach used, which requires that individuals have identical utility functions 
26:630:52579:28:28:72:546:544:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:(Gronberg  and  Reed,  1994).  We  demonstrate  that  workers'  marginal  costs  associated  with  
26:631:52678:28:27:72:545:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:commuting  time  are  about  €  17  per  hour,  and  that  these  results  are  hardly  sensitive  to  the  
26:632:52786:27:28:72:164:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:specification used. 
26:633:52806:28:27:107:544:461:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Our  estimates  imply  that,  at  the  margin,  workers'  commuting  costs  are  substantial.  For  
26:634:52906:27:28:72:544:434:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:example, when the marginal costs of commuting are € 17 per hour, then an employed worker is 
26:635:52998:28:28:72:546:406:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:indifferent  to  a  job  offer  that  increases  his  daily  commute  by  one  standard  deviation  (35  
26:636:53103:28:27:72:544:378:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:minutes),  yet,  at  the  same  time,  increases  his  daily  net  wage  by  about  €  9.91,  so  about  the  net  
26:637:53218:27:28:71:208:351:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:wage for one hour of work.  
26:638:53246:28:27:107:542:323:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Our finding of substantial marginal costs of commuting is consistent with the observation 
26:639:53336:27:28:72:543:296:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that workers' average commuting time is short, whereas, at the same time, there is a large labour 
26:640:53434:28:28:72:543:268:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:economics literature which argues that there is a large variation in wages offered to job seekers, 
26:641:53533:28:27:72:544:240:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:and  that  non-wage  characteristics  may  be  relevant  (Burdett  and  Mortensen,  1998).  If  the  costs  
26:642:53641:27:28:72:543:213:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:associated with commuting were small, as, for example, implied by Calfee and Winston (1998), 
26:643:53734:28:27:72:545:185:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:workers  would  be  willing  to  accept,  at  least  temporarily,  much  longer  commuting  times  than  
26:644:53839:27:28:72:543:158:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:observed in the data. In our (representative) sample, the average commuting time is 23 minutes 
26:645:53934:28:26:72:544:130:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:(one-way),  and  only  8%  of  workers  commute  more  than  60  minutes  (one-way).  This  suggests  
26:646:54036:26:7:72:542:104:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:F:                                                                                                                                                                                           
26:647:54222:7:0:72:543:97:49:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f7:F:26 However, Kahneman et al. (2004) show that, on average, workers feel slightly better during work than 
27:648:54328:0:28:72:427:710:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:that the marginal costs associated with commuting are indeed substantial. 
27:649:54402:28:28:107:544:682:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:A:Our  estimation  approach  is  consistent  with  search-theoretical  approaches  applied  in  the  
27:650:54501:28:27:72:544:654:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:‘wasteful  commuting’  literature,  and  it  is  interesting  to  apply  our  results  to  that  literature.  For  
27:651:54616:27:28:72:544:627:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:example,  the  study  by  Van  Ommeren  and  Van  der  Straaten  (2008)  uses  a  theoretical  model  
27:652:54718:28:27:72:545:599:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:similar  to  that  used  in  the  current  paper.  In  that  paper,  as  in  this  one,  it  is  also  argued  that  
27:653:54835:27:28:72:543:572:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:workers have to search for jobs, and it is shown that, due to a finite job arrival rate, workers are 
27:654:54936:28:28:72:543:544:144:g_d0_f9:145:g_d0_f7:B:not able to minimise the length of their commute. Their empirical results imply that, on average, 
27:655:55034:28:27:71:542:516:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:about 40% of the daily commuting time (46 minutes per day) is due to job search frictions. Using 
27:656:55131:27:28:72:546:489:145:g_d0_f7:145:g_d0_f7:B:a  marginal  commuting  cost  of  €  17  per  hour,  this  implies  that  the  daily  costs  of  ‘wasteful
