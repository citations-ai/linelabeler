2:12:418:22:16:130:495:525:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:While folk theorems for dynamic renewable common pool resource games sustain cooperation as an
2:13:512:16:17:116:495:509:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:equilibrium, the possibility of reverting to violence to appropriate the resource destroys the incentives to
2:14:620:17:16:116:495:492:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:cooperate, because of the expectation of conflict when resources are sufficiently depleted. In this paper, we
2:15:729:16:17:116:495:476:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:provide experimental evidence that individuals behave according to the theoretical predictions.  For high
2:16:834:17:16:116:495:459:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:stocks of resources, when conflict is a highly costly activity, participants cooperate less than in the control
2:17:945:16:17:116:495:443:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:group,  and they play the non-cooperative action with higher frequency.   This comes as a consequence
2:18:1046:17:16:116:495:426:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of the (correct) anticipation that, when resources run low, the conflict option is used by a large share of
2:19:1153:16:38:116:160:410:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:participants.

2:22:1251:61:28:91:190:293:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:1    Introduction
2:23:1268:28:18:91:519:265:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The depletion of the world’s renewable natural resources has become increasingly concerning and is re-
2:24:1370:18:18:91:519:247:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:flected in the warnings of the scientific community (Homer Dixon 1999, Stern 2007). When such resources
2:25:1473:18:18:91:519:229:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:are commonly managed, they are prone to thetragedy of the commonsproblem, i.e. over-extraction resulting
2:26:1577:18:18:91:519:211:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:from inherent externality problems (Hardin 1968). The management of these resources is best described in
2:27:1681:18:14:91:519:193:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a formal dynamic setting, which allows to capture the regenerative nature of resources through time.  In a

3:32:2080:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:dynamic setting, cooperation on the efficient extraction of a renewable resource can be sustained among re-
3:33:2187:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:source users by the threat of reverting to noncooperation in case of noncompliance to some agreed behaviour
3:34:2294:18:18:91:344:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(Cave 1987, Dutta 1995, Sorger 2005, Dutta and Radner 2009).
3:35:2354:18:18:106:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:More recently, the game theoretic predictions on the management of the commons have received exten-
3:36:2453:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sive attention by experimental economists. The early experimental literature focused on testing the equilib-
3:37:2561:18:18:91:520:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rium behavior generated by repeated games (Palfrey and Rosenthal 1994, Dal B ́o 2005), or finite dynamic
3:38:2665:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:games (Herr et al. 1997). In general, findings tend to concur with the theoretical predictions, suggesting that
3:39:2776:18:18:91:519:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:free riding and therefore inefficiencies do arise, and that dynamics help fostering the cooperative equilib-
3:40:2884:18:18:91:520:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rium through reputation mechanisms and the existence of latent punishment schemes.1Exploring whether
3:41:2984:18:18:91:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation can be sustained in dynamic games of resource exploitation is a more challenging question that
3:42:3090:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:has only been tackled recently (Frechette 2014). Since the cooperative extraction level can be sustained with
3:43:3199:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:several different subgame perfect punishments,  experimental economists need to limit their experimental
3:44:3303:18:18:91:519:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tests to a (some) specific strategie(s).  Vespa (2014) shows that individuals tend to cooperate in a dynamic
3:45:3411:18:18:91:519:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:renewable common pool resource (CPR) game if given the possibility to “cooperate” or “defect” to the non-
3:46:3516:18:17:91:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperative Markovian strategy. Yet such cooperation is jeopardized when participants are offered the choice
3:47:3624:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of a “highly profitable” deviation.  These findings therefore seem to suggest that individuals do cooperate
3:48:3731:18:18:91:279:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:under the threat of some punishment strategies.
3:49:3778:18:18:106:519:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The punishment strategies described above rely on the dynamic nature of the game.  As a consequence,
3:50:3878:18:18:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the picture changes if players are given the possibility to alter the nature of the game via their actions. Sekeris
3:51:3993:18:18:91:519:346:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2014) demonstrates that in a dynamic renewable CPR game, where individuals are given the choice to revert
3:52:4099:18:18:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to violence at any point in time so as to claim ownership of the common resource, the efficient solution may
3:53:4207:18:18:91:519:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:not be sustainable at equilibrium. This follows from the players’ incentives to violently appropriate the CPR
3:54:4316:18:18:91:519:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:when the resource becomes scarce, which renders the non-cooperative punishments necessary to support
3:55:4416:18:18:91:519:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation not subgame perfect, and therefore invalidates the logic of Folk theorems. Given the important
3:56:4522:18:18:91:519:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:consequences that such reasoning may have with regards to the conservation of resources that are vital for
3:57:4628:18:18:91:519:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sustainaining human life, such as fresh water, land and fossil fuels, it is crucial to inquire whether individuals
3:58:4742:18:18:91:223:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:do act as rational theory predicts.
3:59:4777:18:15:106:520:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:A burgeoning experimental literature on conflicts has emerged lately.2While the initial contributions
3:60:4878:15:17:102:520:187:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:1Scholars have also demonstrated a tendency of participants to use costly punishments against non-cooperators, even that leaves
3:61:5005:17:8:91:335:170:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:them materially worse-off(Fehr and Gaechter 2000, Casari and Plott, 2003).

4:63:5147:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:subjected to experimental validation static theories of conflict, the dynamic considerations we are focusing
4:64:5255:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:on have equally received attention by scholars more recently (Abbink and de Haan 2014, Lacomba et al.
4:65:5356:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2014, McBride and Skaperdas 2014). Yet, whereas all the contributions perceive conflict as an appropriation
4:66:5463:18:18:91:520:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of private goods and/or production potential, our approach conceives the status quo as a CPR game. Coop-
4:67:5567:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:eration in experimental conflict settings has equally received some attention, albeit the focus of the existing
4:68:5678:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:literature has been on alliance formation as opposed to cooperation in the production process (Ke et al. 2015,
4:69:5788:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Herbst et al.  forthcoming).  Moreover, to conform to the theory of Sekeris that we are testing, we design a
4:70:5896:18:18:91:392:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:conflict experiment replicating an infinite-horizon game as in Vespa (2014).
4:71:5972:18:18:106:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In this paper, we therefore experimentally explore whether the possibility of costly appropriation of a
4:72:6075:18:18:91:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:CPR modifies the incentives to cooperate. To that end, we develop a simplified version of the model in Sek-
4:73:6182:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:eris (2014), which allows us to derive clear predictions with regards to the players’ optimal strategies. In the
4:74:6294:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:absence of costly appropriation, the theory predicts that cooperation can be sustained at equilibrium.  With
4:75:6402:18:18:91:519:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the introduction of costly appropriation results change dramatically: individuals stop cooperating by opting
4:76:6510:18:18:91:519:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:for non-cooperation in the early stages of the game, and eventually resorting to costly appropriation.  To
4:77:6616:18:17:91:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:experimentally evaluate the applicability of this theory, we design three treatments and compare cooperation
4:78:6724:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rates across them.  Each treatment involves 58 participants, for a combined total of 174 students from the
4:79:6830:18:18:91:191:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:University of York (UK).
4:80:6854:18:18:106:519:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In all treatments participants are randomly matched into pairs and then called to decide the amount of
4:81:6956:18:18:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘points’ to extract from a pool of points at each ‘round’ of the game, and given a pre-defined regeneration
4:82:7063:18:18:91:155:346:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rate of the CPR.
4:83:7079:18:18:106:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In the first treatment, which we label the ‘chance’ treatment, during each ‘round’ participants are given
4:84:7184:18:18:91:519:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the possibility to extract either a ‘low’ level of points corresponding to the theoretical prediction of a coop-
4:85:7296:18:18:91:519:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:erative extraction, or a ‘high’ level of points corresponding to the theoretical prediction of a non-cooperative
4:86:7408:18:18:91:519:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(Markov-perfect) extraction.  In addition to ‘low’ and ‘high’, participants are given the choice of opting for
4:87:7518:18:18:91:519:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:resource appropriation, denoted by ‘chance’, whereby the CPR is split equally between the two paired indi-
4:88:7624:18:18:91:520:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:viduals, at some cost which is increasing in the stock of the CPR.3If at some time period chance is played,
4:89:7731:18:18:91:496:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the optimal extraction path is imposed on participants from the subsequent time period and thereafter.
4:90:7833:18:15:106:519:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In the second treatment, which represents our first control treatment and is labelled the ‘no-chance con-
4:91:7938:15:17:102:520:187:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:3We  deliberately  chose  a  neutral  tag  to  denote  the  conflict  action  in  our  experiment  to  avoid  any  framing  bias.   In  particular,
4:92:8085:17:14:91:519:170:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:had we named our resource appropriation ‘conflict’ or ‘violence’, changes in cooperation rates across treatments may have been the
4:93:8215:14:0:91:300:156:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:consequence of different moral/ethical values among participants.
5:94:8281:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:trol’ treatment,  participants play the same game but without the ‘chance’ option.  This control treatment
5:95:8387:17:18:91:346:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:allows us to directly test the theoretical predictions of the paper.
5:96:8455:18:18:106:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Finally, we design an alternative control treatment named ‘chance control’.  This treatment is identical
5:97:8559:18:18:91:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to the ‘chance’ treatment, except for the cost of opting for resource appropriation, which is substantially
5:98:8666:18:18:91:520:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:increased to make it theoretically suboptimal.  In other words, we offer participants the same three options
5:99:8774:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:as in the ‘chance’ treatment (i.e.  low, high extraction rates and chance), but if chance is chosen 60% of the
5:100:8884:18:18:91:412:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:CPR is destroyed, thus making that choice suboptimal for any level of resources.
5:101:8964:18:18:106:519:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To emulate the infinite horizon environment required for folk theorems to be applicable, we follow the
5:102:9066:18:18:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:methodology in Vespa (2014) which was first introduced by Roth and Murnighan (1978) and later applied
5:103:9167:18:18:91:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by Cabral et al.  (2011).  The technique introduces an uncertain time horizon by allowing the software to
5:104:9272:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:terminate the game at any ‘time period’ with some predetermined probability. This practice - which in theory
5:105:9380:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is equivalent to an infinite time horizon if individuals are risk neutral - has been shown not to be innocuous in
5:106:9493:18:18:91:520:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:practice (Dal b ́o 2005, Frechette and Yuksel 2014). Since both our control and treatment groups are subject
5:107:9601:18:18:91:473:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to the same random termination rule, however, the validity of our experiment is not jeopardized.
5:108:9697:18:17:106:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Our experimental findings support the theory of Sekeris (2014).  Under the chance treatment the level
5:109:9798:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of cooperation is lower compared to both control treatments, and non-cooperation is higher. Both the mag-
5:110:9903:18:18:91:519:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:nitude of the coefficients and the level of significance are larger when compared to the non-chance control
5:111:10010:18:18:91:519:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatment,  than  when  comparing  to  the  costly  chance  control  group.   This  signals  higher  levels  of  non-
5:112:10127:18:18:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation and lower levels of cooperation under the costly chance treatment than under the no-chance

5:114:10335:18:18:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:incentivize participants to substitute cooperation by non-cooperation. The fact that cooperation is lower and
5:115:10444:18:18:91:519:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:non-cooperation larger in the chance treatment compared to the chance control treatment implies that the
5:116:10548:18:18:91:519:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:expectation of a higher likelihood of chance being played in later stages of the game reduces cooperation
5:117:10653:18:18:91:519:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in favour of non-cooperation in the early stages of the game. Restricting the analysis to the early rounds of
5:118:10762:18:18:91:519:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the game (or alternatively to high levels of CPR) confirms that participants tend to non-cooperate more in
5:119:10868:18:18:91:367:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:expectation of chance being potentially chosen in subsequent rounds.
5:120:10936:18:18:106:519:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In the following section we lay out a simplified version of Sekeris (2014), in Section 3 we describe the

6:124:11254:18:18:91:519:640:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and denoted byt={0,1...∞}.  Two players labeled 1 and 2 simultaneously decide at each time period the
6:125:11355:18:18:91:519:622:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:amount of resources to extract from the common pool of resources. The initial resource endowment is given
6:126:11460:18:17:91:520:604:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:byr0and the resource regenerates at some linear rateγ.  Players costlessly invest effort in resource-use, so
6:127:11568:17:18:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that playeri’s appropriation effort of renewable resources in timetis denoted byei,t, withei,t∈[0, ̄e], ̄e>r0.

7:227:13734:25:18:91:519:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The cooperative strategy yields - by construction - a Pareto-dominant situation, and given the assumed sym-

8:229:13953:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:equilibrium strategy for any given starting stock of resources.  A strategy whereby players cooperate irre-
8:230:14060:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:spective of the opponent’s action cannot be an equilibrium strategy, however, since the instantaneous utility
8:231:14169:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of  deviating  from  the  cooperative  extraction  rate  is  higher  than  the  instantaneous  utility  of  cooperating.
8:232:14289:18:18:91:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To sustain cooperation, therefore, punishment strategies should be considered.  A widespread strategy that
8:233:14395:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:supports the cooperative extraction path as a subgame perfect equilibrium, is the Grimm-trigger strategy,
8:234:14500:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:whereby any deviation from the cooperative action by either player implies that both players revert to the
8:235:14606:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:non-cooperative MPE forever after.  One interesting route is therefore to derive the conditions that induce
8:236:14713:18:18:91:520:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:play of the cooperative path in equilibrium. For cooperation to be sustained as a SPE it is sufficient that the

9:266:16482:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:technology that grants each player the control over half the resource stock from the time-period the conflict

9:269:16802:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:conflict cannot vary endogenously in this setting, and we instead impose that conflict may be destructive, so
9:270:16911:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that the resource resilience to conflict is described by some functionφ(rt)∈[0,1], withφ(rt)′≤0, and such

9:274:17288:26:28:104:351:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2.  Both players decide their extraction efforts simultaneously.

10:363:19508:18:18:91:519:374:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f6:φ(rt) is continuously defined on ] ̄r, ̄ ̄r[, there exists a  ˆr∈[ ̄r, ̄ ̄r] such that the inequality is satisfied for any
10:364:19630:18:18:91:124:356:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f6:rt+1<ˆr.
10:365:19638:18:18:106:519:338:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Having shown that cooperation cannot be sustained forever, we now demonstrate that cooperation is not
10:366:19739:18:18:91:519:320:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sustainable in the short run either and that the game’s unique equilibrium involves non-cooperative behaviour
10:367:19848:18:18:91:519:302:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:for high stocks of resources, as well as conflict for low stocks of resources. To establish this, we exploit the
10:368:19960:18:18:91:519:284:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:previous result according to which cooperation is not sustainable forever, together with the fact that for low
10:369:20070:18:18:91:519:266:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:levels of resources, violence is better than the discounted expected utility of non-cooperation.  The latter
10:370:20178:18:26:91:482:248:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:result is proven by establishing that there exist values ofrt, which satisfy the following inequality:
10:371:20280:26:27:264:520:222:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f6:Vviolencei(rt)>Vnci(rt)(19)
10:372:20307:27:26:106:345:195:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Replacing for the appropriate values and simplifying yields:
10:373:20367:26:27:238:520:169:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(1−δ) ln(φ(rt)/2)+ln(2−δ)>0(20)
10:374:20398:27:0:106:363:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Replacingrtby  ̄rimplies that the condition is satisfied for anyδ.
11:375:20465:0:17:106:520:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Defining by ˆrthe maximal value of resources satisfying inequality (20), we show that for any resources
11:376:20568:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f6:rt>ˆrplayers will play non-cooperatively.  Assume that in periodτwe expect conflict to be the preferred
11:377:20671:18:18:91:520:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:option  if  both  players  expect  each  other  to  cooperate.   Then  int=τ−1,  should  one’s  opponent  play
11:378:20781:18:18:91:520:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperatively, it is optimal to play the non-cooperative best response.  Hence, int=τ−1, both players
11:379:20882:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:will play non-cooperatively.  This mutual non-cooperation is due to the fact that in timeτplayers have no
11:380:20987:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:punishment scheme to support cooperation.  Applying the argument backwardly implies that players never
11:381:21089:18:26:91:298:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperate, which leads to the following proposition.
11:382:21141:26:18:91:520:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f10:Proposition 2.In a renewable resource exploitation game, where players can revert to violence to appro-
11:383:21244:18:18:91:519:535:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:priate the common pool resource, the equilibrium is such that players exploit the resource non-cooperatively
11:384:21352:18:42:91:253:517:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:if r>ˆr and they declare conflict if r≤ˆr.

11:386:21418:32:24:91:201:443:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:3.1    Parametrization
11:387:21440:24:18:91:519:419:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:For the experimental game, we fix the parameters of the model such that (i) cooperation is supported as a
11:388:21545:18:18:91:519:401:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:SPE in the conflict-free version of the game, and (ii) conflict is the players’ preferred option when resources
11:389:21656:18:18:91:463:383:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:are sufficiently depleted in the conflict version of the game, therefore verifying Proposition 2.
11:390:21753:18:18:106:520:365:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The unique sufficient condition for (i) to hold is thatδ >1/2. We accordingly set the discount rate in the
11:391:21859:18:18:91:519:347:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:lab toδ=0.7, and the values ofscandsncare thus respectively fixed at 0.15 and 0.23. The associated value
11:392:21963:18:18:91:435:329:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of the non-cooperative best response to cooperation,sdev=(1−δ)(1+δ)2, is equal to 0.255.
11:393:22051:18:18:106:424:311:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We set the initial stock of points to ber0=40 and the regeneration rateγ=0.3.
11:394:22128:18:18:106:520:293:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Lastly, we give some structure to functionφ(rt) to be able to simulate payoffs.  To keep figures simple,

12:407:22456:0:24:91:152:686:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:3.2    Design
12:408:22469:24:18:91:519:662:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The experiment was programmed in zTree and participants where recruited among students of the University
12:409:22573:18:18:91:520:644:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of York using hroot (Bock et al. 2014). We conducted three different treatments, each involving 58 partici-
12:410:22680:18:18:91:519:626:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:pants. Each treatment consists of one supergame, in which participants play 20 identical games (10 practice
12:411:22787:18:18:91:520:608:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:games and 10 “real” games with a lottery payment of two out of the 10 “real” games).6For each game,
12:412:22886:18:18:91:519:590:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:participants are randomly matched into pairs, whereby each game runs for a randomly determined number
12:413:22987:18:18:91:519:572:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of rounds.  Random rematching at the end of each game occurs using zTree’s matching-stranger option.  To
12:414:23091:18:18:91:519:554:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:implement an infinitely dynamic game in the laboratory, we follow the methodology of Vespa (2014), build-
12:415:23196:18:18:91:519:536:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ing on Roth and Murninghan (1978) and the recent application of Cabral et al.  (2011).  Like Vespa (2014),
12:416:23302:18:18:91:520:518:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we impose that the first six rounds of each game are played with unit probability but the earned payoffis
12:417:23407:18:17:91:519:500:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:discounted at a constant rate of 0.7. From round 7 onwards, the software randomly terminates the game with
12:418:23513:17:18:91:520:483:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a probability of (1−δ)=0.3. The rationale for adopting such a hybrid termination rule is that, without such a
12:419:23622:18:18:91:519:465:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rule in place for the entire game (i.e. such that at each round the game would terminate with probability 0.3),
12:420:23733:18:18:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the average length of a game would approximately equal 3.3 periods, thus potentially inducing players not
12:421:23838:18:18:91:519:429:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to cooperate despite the Pareto-superiority of cooperation. Indeed,if both players were to always cooperate,
12:422:23946:18:18:91:519:411:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation would start dominating non-cooperation after round 5, as shown in Figure 1, where we depict
12:423:24049:18:18:91:520:393:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cumulated payoffs under mutual cooperation and mutual non-cooperation, respectively.  Imposing 6 rounds
12:424:24152:18:18:91:520:375:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of certain play increases the average number of rounds played to 9.3, without affecting players’ expected
12:425:24257:18:18:91:123:357:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:payoffs.
12:426:24265:18:18:106:519:339:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In all treatments, participants begin each game with a common pool of 40 ‘points’.  In our first control
12:427:24369:18:18:91:519:321:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatment,  denoted ‘no-chance control’,  participants are given two extraction choices,  either a ‘high’ ex-
12:428:24478:18:18:91:520:303:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f9:traction rate or a ‘low’ one.  To capture the prisoners’ dilemma nature of the game, we respect the payoff
12:429:24584:18:18:91:519:285:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:structure of the theoretical model so that the (constant) shares of points that are extracted for each combina-
12:430:24695:18:25:91:321:267:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tion of choices of paired participants are given as follows:
12:431:24755:25:25:106:396:242:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f6:•If both players play ‘high’, each extracts 23% of the remaining points.
12:432:24827:25:18:106:520:217:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f6:•If a player opts for ‘low’, he/she extracts 15% of the remaining points, irrespective of the other player’s
12:433:24935:18:25:116:158:199:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:extraction.
12:434:24946:25:15:106:518:174:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f6:•If a player plays ‘high’ and his/her match plays ‘low’, he/she extracts 25.5% of the remaining points.
12:435:25049:15:17:102:519:159:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:6This payment method was chosen to prevent participants from adapting strategies with regards to cumulated payoffs obtained
12:436:25172:17:0:91:158:142:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:during earlier games.
13:437:25195:0:42:138:473:454:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Figure 1: Cumulated payoffs under mutual cooperation and mutual non-cooperation
13:438:25274:42:17:106:520:412:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Our  actual  treatment  -  denoted  ‘chance’  treatment  -  offers  participants  the  same  choices  as  the  ones
13:439:25389:17:18:91:519:395:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:described above, and additionally these participants can opt for ‘chance’ at any round of the game. If chance
13:440:25498:18:18:91:519:377:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is selected, the CPR is subjected to a loss described by function (21), and the remaining stock of points is
13:441:25606:18:18:91:519:359:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:shared equally among both players, who are from then on imposed the (optimal) ‘low’ level of extraction
13:442:25709:18:18:91:519:341:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:for the current and all subsequent rounds.  Consistent with the theoretical findings, we expect that, when
13:443:25815:18:18:91:519:323:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:confronted with this treatment, participants should play less cooperatively and more non-cooperatively in a
13:444:25922:18:18:91:520:305:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:game’s early rounds, while chance should be selected after the stock of points drops below 29.15 (i.e. when
13:445:26029:18:18:91:200:287:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:inequality (20) is satisfied).
13:446:26059:18:18:106:519:269:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The two treatments described above differ not only in the options given to the participants, but also in the
13:447:26167:18:18:91:520:251:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:number of choices offered. It could therefore be argued that, when presented with an additional option in the
13:448:26276:18:18:91:519:233:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘chance’ treatment, the level of cooperation will naturally decrease,ceteris paribus, if chance is to be played
13:449:26387:18:18:91:519:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:for any reason compatible or not with our theory. In order to curb such potential criticisms we implemented
13:450:26494:18:18:91:519:197:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a second control treatment, denoted by ‘chance control’. In the latter treatment, players are confronted with
13:451:26603:18:18:91:519:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the same three choices as in the ‘chance treatment’, with the sole difference that the cost of playing chance
13:452:26712:18:18:91:519:161:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in terms of CPR losses equals 60% of the stock, irrespective of the amount of points that remain. The 60%
13:453:26817:18:0:91:498:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:figure guarantees that choosing chance is never optimal from a theoretical perspective for participants.
14:454:26923:0:17:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In addition to the instructions that were handed out to participants (see Appendix A.2), the screen indi-
14:455:27028:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cated the amount of points that would be available in the next time period for each potential choice partici-
14:456:27137:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:pants could make, and for all respective choices of the opponent. This information was available during each
14:457:27245:18:18:91:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:round of the game. Participants could pre-select an option, in which case a red frame would appear around
14:458:27350:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:their choice. They then had to confirm their selection be pressing “OK”, which let them proceed to the next
14:459:27457:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:round.  A screenshot of the ‘chance’ treatment is provided in Figure 2.  It illustrates the functionality of the

15:466:27875:28:18:91:519:658:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Before presenting the empirical results, some descriptive statistics may prove useful in grasping the partici-
15:467:27985:18:18:91:519:640:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:pants’ behaviour. In Figure 3 we depict the cumulated share of participants opting for cooperation across the
15:468:28094:18:18:91:520:622:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:three treatments. There is a marked difference between treatments, with cooperation being played at a higher
15:469:28202:18:17:91:519:604:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rate - at any given round - in the no-chance treatment (top discontinuous curve) - , and with cooperation being
15:470:28313:17:18:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chosen less often in the chance treatment (bottom continuous curve).  This very preliminary result concurs
15:471:28419:18:18:91:519:569:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:with our theoretical expectations: the anticipation of chance being played in either the chance-control or the
15:472:28529:18:18:91:519:551:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance treatments reduces players’ propensity to opt for cooperation. Moreover, with chance-control being
15:473:28634:18:18:91:519:533:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sub-optimal, it is reasonable to expect that players anticipate chance to be played more frequently in the
15:474:28740:18:18:91:397:515:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance treatment, and therefore to cooperate even less in the latter treatment.
15:475:28819:18:18:106:519:497:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Our theoretical predictions suggest that cooperation should be substituted by non-cooperation when the
15:476:28921:18:18:91:519:479:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:CPR is relatively abundant. To see that this is indeed the case, consider Figure 4, where we have plotted the
15:477:29030:18:18:91:519:461:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cumulated share of participants that opt for non-cooperation across the three treatments.  Interestingly, we
15:478:29138:18:18:91:519:443:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:observe a trend, which seems to mirror the cooperation rates in the game’s initial rounds, so that it is the
15:479:29246:18:18:91:519:425:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:participants in the chance treatment who are least cooperative in all rounds (followed by the chance control
15:480:29354:18:18:91:316:407:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatment, and then by the no-chance-control treatment).
15:481:29410:18:18:106:519:389:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To convince the reader of this preliminary evidence, we have plotted the proportion of participants play-
15:482:29515:18:18:91:519:371:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ing chance for the two treatments where chance is permitted in Figure 5.  This Figure shows that the dif-
15:483:29620:18:18:91:519:353:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ferences between the cooperative and non-cooperative behaviour are intimately linked to the participants’
15:484:29725:18:17:91:520:335:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:propensity to resort to chance during later rounds of the game.  There is a marked difference in the pro-
15:485:29830:17:18:91:519:318:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:portion with which chance is being played in the chance (continuous curve) and the chance-control (dotted
15:486:29935:18:18:91:519:300:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:curve) treatments. In the former treatment, participants are more willing to play chance during any round of
15:487:30043:18:18:91:520:282:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the game, but perhaps more importantly, there is a striking difference between the chronological evolution
15:488:30149:18:18:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:depicted in the separate curves. In the chance treatment we observe a sharp increase in round 3, which cor-
15:489:30256:18:18:91:519:246:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:responds to the round where the level of points is - on average - in the range where chance becomes optimal
15:490:30363:18:18:91:519:228:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in theory. Since chance is never optimal in the chance-control treatment, we should expect no similar pattern
15:491:30472:18:18:91:519:210:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the latter treatment, which seems to be confirmed by Figure 5.  Under both treatments we do, however,
15:492:30576:18:18:91:519:192:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:observe an increase in the proportion of participants that play chance in later rounds.  This behaviour may
15:493:30683:18:18:91:519:174:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:be due to several reasons.  One could be that participants resort to some sort of protection mechanism by
15:494:30788:18:0:91:519:156:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:attempting to put an end to the depletion of the CPR. Other psychological mechanisms could be invoked to
16:495:30894:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:explain these observations, but irrespective of the cause of this behaviour, the only explanation for the higher
16:496:31006:17:292:91:516:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rate of non-cooperation in the game’s early rounds must be the expectation of such behaviour in the future.

16:498:31167:40:18:106:519:337:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The patterns presented in Figures 3-5 are consistent with our mechanism.   Visual correlations alone,
16:499:31268:18:18:91:519:319:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:however, cannot be interpreted as causal evidence.  We therefore turn now to regression analysis and we
16:500:31371:18:27:91:210:301:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:estimate the following model:

16:508:32113:17:0:91:447:142:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the variable Round. Substituting Round with the level of stock of points produces qualitatively identical results.

17:511:32388:18:18:91:520:401:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and social sciences (social), with the residual group being humanities. As for gender, since it may influence
17:512:32497:18:18:91:519:383:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the attitude of participants, both towards cooperation and towards the chance option, we include a dummy

17:514:32712:18:18:91:488:347:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of interest isδ, which captures the impact of having the ‘chance’ option on the level of cooperation.

17:518:33010:25:18:91:519:251:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In Table 2 we report the results of estimating model (22), where the control group is restricted to the no-
17:519:33117:18:18:91:519:233:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance control treatment only.8In other words, we are comparing the behaviour of a participant having only
17:520:33223:18:18:91:519:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:two choices (low and high extraction rates) with the behaviour of participants having three options (low, high,
17:521:33334:18:17:91:519:197:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and chance).  The first column of Table 2 reports the results of the benchmark specification and as shown
17:522:33439:17:16:91:520:180:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:all coefficients are statistically significant at the 1% level.  Compared to the no-chance control, participants
17:523:33551:16:17:102:520:164:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:8All model specifications are estimated by OLS. Replicating our estimates by a probit estimation does not affect our results qualita-
17:524:33684:17:0:91:110:147:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:tively.

18:526:33742:42:18:91:520:380:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the chance treatment tend to cooperate by 23.6 percentage points less on average, thus lending support
18:527:33847:18:18:91:519:362:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to our theoretical findings.  Given that the average level of cooperation in the no-chance-control treatment
18:528:33955:18:18:91:519:344:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:equals 37%, this implies that the introduction of the chance option reduces the likelihood of cooperation by
18:529:34063:18:18:91:520:326:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:63.7%. Consistently with previous findings, theGamecoefficient, which captures the learning effect across
18:530:34168:18:18:91:520:308:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:games, implies that the level of cooperation decreases on average by 0.4 percentage points from one game
18:531:34272:18:18:91:520:290:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to another (Dal B ́o and Fr ́echette 2011). Moreover, cooperation is decreasing on average by 1.6 percentage
18:532:34380:18:18:91:519:272:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:point  from  one  round  to  another  within  a  game.   As  will  become  clear  later,  the  latter  result  is  mainly
18:533:34501:18:18:91:519:254:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:driven by participants’ increasingly frequent choice of chance, on the one hand, and by the participants’
18:534:34606:18:18:91:519:236:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:increasingly frequent reversion to non-cooperation when the stock of points start to run very low.  Lastly,
18:535:34713:18:18:91:520:218:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the gender and studies coefficients take signs compatible with earlier findings:  male participants tend to
18:536:34820:18:18:91:519:200:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperate less (Eckel and Grossman 1998), and the same holds true for non-humanities students (Frank et
18:537:34923:18:18:91:130:182:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:al. 1993).
18:538:34933:18:17:106:520:164:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The negative effect on cooperation of allowing participants to use the ‘chance’ option does not necessar-
18:539:35038:17:0:91:519:147:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ily map onto an increase of non-cooperation to the extent that the effect may be driven by an increase in the
19:540:35149:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:use of the third option which is unavailable in the no-chance-control group.  Our main theoretical finding,
19:541:35256:17:18:91:520:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:which is summarized in Proposition 2, stipulates that for high levels of the stock of points (i.e.r>29.15
19:542:35361:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:given our parametrization) the optimal decision is to choose the non-cooperative extraction rate, with the
19:543:35467:18:18:91:520:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance option being used only when the stock of points is sufficiently depleted (r≤29.15). To verify there-
19:544:35574:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:fore that we indeed observe a substitution of cooperation by non-cooperation, we restrict our estimation in
19:545:35681:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:multiple ways.   In column 2 of Table 2,  we restrict the sample tor>29 to see whether for high stock
19:546:35782:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of points - where chance is unlikely to have been chosen - cooperation does decrease.  Compared to the
19:547:35884:18:18:91:520:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:benchmark estimation (Column 1), the coefficient is smaller but still negative and significant at the 5% level,
19:548:35995:18:18:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:thus implying that cooperation decreases as compared to the no-chance-control treatment, when resorting to
19:549:36101:18:18:91:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance is theoretically sub-optimal. Given, however, that the stock of points is endogenous to the extraction
19:550:36210:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rates of participants, in columns 3 and 4 we equally exclude the rounds where ‘chance’ has been played, and
19:551:36317:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in Column 4 we further restrict the sample to the first 6 rounds of play, where the random termination rule
19:552:36424:18:18:91:520:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:has not yet kicked in.  The rationale for excluding the rounds where ‘chance’ has been played, is to restrict
19:553:36533:18:18:91:519:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the comparison of the no-chance treatment to rounds where the treated group opted for cooperation or non-
19:554:36638:18:17:91:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation alone.  The results further confirm a substitution away from cooperation to non-cooperation in
19:555:36744:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the chance treatment.  Lastly, in column 5 of Table 2, we restrict the analysis to the first two rounds.  Given
19:556:36855:18:18:91:519:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that all games begin with a stock of 40 points, the stock of points would equal 28 in round 2, even if both
19:557:36962:18:18:91:520:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:players played ‘high’ in the game’s first rounds, making participants roughly indifferent between playing
19:558:37067:18:18:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘chance’ and not.  Cooperation is significantly lower under the chance treatment by 14.7 percentage points,
19:559:37174:18:18:91:235:346:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:further confirming our expectations.
19:560:37210:18:18:106:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In Table 3 we present the results of the same specifications as in Table 2 by replacing the dependent
19:561:37311:18:18:91:520:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variable bynon-cooperation.  The benchmark regression yields a negative coefficient, which is significant
19:562:37416:18:18:91:520:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:at the 1% level:  adding the ‘chance’ option reduces non-cooperation on average by 20.3 percentage points
19:563:37521:18:18:91:519:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:compared to the no-chance-treatment.  One may be tempted to conclude that the inclusion of the ‘chance’
19:564:37624:18:18:91:520:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:option leads to a reduction ofbothcooperation and non-cooperation in favour of ‘chance’, thus possibly con-
19:565:37731:18:18:91:519:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tradicting Proposition 2.  Such an interpretation would be mistaken, however, since the benchmark model
19:566:37834:18:18:91:519:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:captures the average effects of the introduction of chance in a standard CPR exploitation game, while Propo-
19:567:37942:18:18:91:519:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sition 2 clearly identifies two distinct optimal choices depending on the stock of points:  where points are
19:568:38050:18:18:91:519:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:abundant non-cooperation should increase, whereas where points are scarce chance is the optimal choice.
19:569:38153:18:17:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We therefore proceed in columns 2-5 with the same sample restrictions as in Table 2. If Proposition 2 is to be
19:570:38263:17:0:91:519:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:verified, we should expect non-cooperation to increase only when the stock of points is abundant, or alterna-
20:571:38374:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tively in the early rounds of the game. Our results confirm this prediction: according to the results reported
20:572:38484:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in column 5, non-cooperation increases by 14.2 percentage points in the game’s first two rounds compared
20:573:38588:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to the no-chance control treatment.  Hence, the possibility of reverting to ‘chance’ induces participants to
20:574:38696:18:18:91:448:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:substitute cooperation with non-cooperation when the stock of points is sufficiently large.
20:575:38787:18:18:106:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To provide additional evidence of this mechanism, in Figure 5 we report the cumulative share of partic-
20:576:38890:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ipants opting for ‘chance’.  Consider the solid line, describing the share of participants choosing ‘chance’
20:577:38998:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the chance treatment. Firstly, it clearly reveals that virtually no participant opts for ‘chance’ in the first 2
20:578:39113:18:18:91:519:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rounds of the game. Secondly, we observe a surge of ‘chance’ being chosen in rounds 3 to 6, rising from it
20:579:39219:18:18:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:being played by 1.5% to 66% of the pairs. This coincides roughly with our expectation that chance becomes
20:580:39324:18:18:91:520:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:optimal when the stock of points drops below 29, since theaveragestock of points in rounds 2 and 3 is equal
20:581:39431:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to 29 and 21.1 points, respectively.  Combined with the results of Tables 2 and 3, we can confidently state
20:582:39538:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that the introduction of a resource appropriation option in an experimental game of renewable CPR exploita-
20:583:39645:18:18:91:519:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tion induces participants to become more non-cooperative in the presence of abundant resource stocks, thus
20:584:39751:18:18:91:422:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:precipitating their depletion, and eventually opting for the partition of the resource.
20:585:39838:18:17:106:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:One potential criticism we ought to consider at this stage is that the no-chance control treatment and the
20:586:39944:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance treatment do not feature the same number of choices.  One could argue that the very existence of
20:587:40047:18:18:91:519:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a third option, whether relevant or not, increases the likelihood of that option being played (possibly even
20:588:40155:18:18:91:519:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by mistake),  thereby triggering more non-cooperation in the chance treatment.  Even though participants
20:589:40259:18:18:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:seem to opt for the ‘chance’ option when that option becomes optimal,  comparing the two options with
20:590:40360:18:18:91:519:346:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the three options game may hide other mechanisms driving our results.  To address this potential concern,
20:591:40465:18:18:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we designed an additional chance-control treatment where participants have the same three choices, namely
20:592:40570:18:18:91:519:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘low’,  ‘high’,  and ‘chance’,  but where the cost of chance is purposefully kept at a level which makes it
20:593:40677:18:18:91:519:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:suboptimal throughout the game.   In Tables 4 and 5 we re-estimate Tables 2 and 3 after substituting the
20:594:40781:18:18:91:308:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance-control group for the no-chance-control group.
20:595:40834:18:18:106:519:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:All the results obtained with the no-chance control treatment remain qualitatively true when using the
20:596:40936:18:18:91:520:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance-control group as the control treatment.  The magnitude of all the relevant coefficients is, however,
20:597:41043:18:18:91:520:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:smaller:  while cooperation decreases by 14.7 percentage points (Table 2) and non-cooperation increases
20:598:41146:18:18:91:519:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by 14.2 percentage points in the game’s two first rounds with the no-chance control as the control treatment
20:599:41254:18:18:91:520:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:group, these coefficients both drop to 11.9 percentage points with the chance-control as the control treatment
20:600:41364:18:17:91:519:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:group. Once more, using Figure 5 - where we compare the proportion of participants opting for chance across
20:601:41471:17:0:91:519:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatments and rounds - can help clarifying the reasons behind the observed drop.  Notice that even though
21:602:41579:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘chance’ is very costly and suboptimal in the chance-control treatment, participants do choose it especially
21:603:41687:17:18:91:520:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the game’s late rounds.  While in round 3 around 1.5% of the participants opted for ‘chance’, this share
21:604:41794:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:increases sharply after round 13,  eventually reaching the 50% figure.   The puzzling fact that ‘chance’ is
21:605:41901:18:18:91:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chosen despite it being sub-optimal could have various explanations. By the time participants reach these late
21:606:42011:18:18:91:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rounds of the game, the difference in their marginal payoffs becomes relatively small, reducing the incentive
21:607:42120:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to carefully plan a playing strategy. Irrespective of the actual reason behind participants’ irrational choice of
21:608:42233:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:playing ‘chance’, what matters is that, when the game lasts many rounds, the ‘chance’ option is chosen with
21:609:42340:18:18:91:519:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:increasing frequency.  Anticipating this, and in line with our theoretical mechanism, participants decrease
21:610:42447:18:18:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation and increase non-cooperation in the game’s early rounds,  thereby reducing the difference in
21:611:42551:18:18:91:393:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation and non-cooperation rates with respect to the chance treatment.
21:612:42626:18:18:106:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:A  marked difference  in  cooperation rates  across  the  chance  and chance-control  treatments,  however,
21:613:42733:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:remains.   Even though participants in the control-chance treatments do expect chance to be played with
21:614:42836:18:18:91:519:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:some probability, they also probably realize (i) that the probability of the game lasting long enough is very
21:615:42945:18:18:91:520:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:low9and (ii) that even then, the share of participants who choose chance is moderate. This strongly contrasts
21:616:43054:18:17:91:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:with the patterns in the chance treatment. As reported in Figure 5 (solid line), about 70% of participants play
21:617:43165:17:36:91:288:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:‘chance’ by round 6, which occurs with certainty.
21:618:43214:36:25:91:385:382:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:4.2    Exploring the mechanism: the expectation of chance
21:619:43271:25:18:91:519:357:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To further convince the reader that it is indeed the expectation of chance being played that triggers non-
21:620:43377:18:18:91:519:339:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation in the game’s early rounds, we propose two additional sets of tests. First, if participants decide
21:621:43487:18:17:91:519:321:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to use the chance option at some stage of the game, it is reasonable to assume that they plan their earlier
21:622:43594:17:18:91:519:304:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:rounds’ strategy accordingly.  We can test whether among participants in the chance treatment, individuals
21:623:43700:18:18:91:519:286:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:who played ‘chance’ in a specific game (defined ‘attackers’) are more likely to choose the non-cooperative
21:624:43806:18:18:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:extraction level in early rounds of that same game. In other words, when restricting the sample of the chance
21:625:43915:18:18:91:519:250:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatment to ‘attackers’, we expect the difference in cooperation and non-cooperation rates (with respect to
21:626:44023:18:18:91:519:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:our control treatments) to be more marked compared to the results of Tables 2 and 3, where the entire chance
21:627:44131:18:18:91:217:214:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:treatment sample is considered.
21:628:44162:18:18:106:519:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The results of this test are reported in Table 6, where the first 4 columns replicate on this trimmed sample
21:629:44270:18:18:91:520:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the specifications in columns 2−5 of Table 2, and the last 4 columns replicate the specifications in columns
21:630:44378:18:15:91:520:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2−5 of Table 3. Interestingly, all coefficients for chance in columns 1−4 are negative and significant at the
21:631:44487:15:0:102:317:145:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:9The probability of a game reaching round 13 for instance is 0.082.
22:632:44556:0:17:91:520:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:1% level.  The magnitude is always larger than the corresponding coefficients of Table 2, hence supporting
22:633:44662:17:18:91:520:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:our intuition.  Similarly,  the coefficients for chance in columns 5−8 of Table 6 are larger in magnitude
22:634:44767:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:than the corresponding coefficients in Table 3, confirming that participants, who eventually revert to chance
22:635:44876:18:18:91:514:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:within a specific game, are more likely to extract the non-cooperative amount of points in that same game.
22:636:44982:18:18:106:520:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The  second  set  of  tests  explores  the  difference  in  behaviour  across  participants  with  a  different  past
22:637:45099:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:experience in the game.  If the substitution of cooperation by non-cooperation observed in the early rounds
22:638:45206:18:18:91:519:579:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of the chance treatment rests in the expectation of ‘chance’ being played, we should expect participants who
22:639:45314:18:18:91:519:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:choose ‘chance’ (‘attackers’), and those matched with them (‘victims’) in the previous game, to increase
22:640:45418:18:18:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:their expectation for chance to be played.  This, in turn, implies that past attackers or victims should more
22:641:45527:18:18:91:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:markedly reduce their cooperation and increase their non-cooperation in the early rounds of a game.  To
22:642:45630:18:18:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:implement this test we create two additional variables: a dummy capturing whether a participant has played
22:643:45736:18:18:91:520:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:chance  in  the  previous  game  (lagged  attacker)  and  another  dummy  capturing  whether  a  participant  was
22:644:45849:18:18:91:520:471:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:matched with an attacker in the previous game (lagged victim).  We then reestimate our models, including
22:645:45953:18:18:91:208:453:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:these two additional controls.
22:646:45983:18:17:106:519:435:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Table 7 reports the results of this test. More specifically, in the 4 first columns of Table 7 we replicate the
22:647:46094:17:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:estimations reported in columns 2-5 of Table 2, whereas columns 5-8 replicate the specifications of columns
22:648:46201:18:18:91:519:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2-5 in Table 3 with the two additional controls.  The results in column 1 suggest that, when the stock of
22:649:46306:18:18:91:520:382:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:points is higher than 29 points, previous game attackers cooperate by 10.4 percentage points less than the
22:650:46412:18:18:91:520:364:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:average participant in the chance treatment. The equivalent figure for victims in the previous game equals 8.7
22:651:46522:18:18:91:520:346:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:percentage points.  This considerable difference between participants who did not experience chance in the
22:652:46628:18:18:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:previous game, and those who did, further supports that the expectation of chance is the mechanism driving
22:653:46734:18:18:91:519:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the drop in cooperation rates. Results in columns 2-4 follow a similar pattern, thus further strengthening our
22:654:46844:18:18:91:147:292:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:interpretation.
22:655:46859:18:18:106:519:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In the last 4 columns of Table 7, we assess the impact of experiencing chance in the previous game on
22:656:46960:18:18:91:519:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the likelihood of extracting the non cooperative level of points.  According to the results in column 5, the
22:657:47068:18:18:91:520:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:non-cooperation rate increases by 7.5 percentage points amonglagged attackers, though the coefficient is
22:658:47172:18:18:91:520:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:not statistically significant, and by 8.7 percentage points amonglagged victimscompared to the average par-
22:659:47279:18:18:91:519:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ticipant in the chance treatment. Again, extending the analysis to alternative sample restrictions in columns
22:660:47388:18:18:91:276:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:6-8, leaves the results qualitatively unaffected.
22:661:47437:18:17:106:519:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Finally we replicate the same exercise but restricting the analysis on participants in the chance treatment.
22:662:47545:17:0:91:519:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We therefore test whether participants that experience ‘chance’ in the previous game, as an attacker or as
23:663:47653:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a victim, are more likely to extract the non-cooperative share of points and less likely to cooperate in the
23:664:47761:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:early periods of the game. The results, reported in Table 8 broadly confirm our previous results. We can thus
23:665:47870:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:confidently deduce that participants who have experienced ‘chance’ in the previous game are more likely to
23:666:47976:18:18:91:519:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:expect ‘chance’ to be chosen in the current game, therefore substituting cooperation by non-cooperation in
23:667:48082:18:43:91:188:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the game’s early rounds.
23:668:48106:43:28:91:181:572:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:5    Conclusion
23:669:48121:28:18:91:519:544:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Folk  theorems  permit  cooperation  to  arise  in  equilibrium  in  dynamic  common  pool  renewable  resource
23:670:48232:18:18:91:519:526:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:games, both theoretically and experimentally. Allowing the players to revert to violence to split the resource
23:671:48342:18:18:91:520:508:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(and to thereafter manage efficiently what has become a private resource) disrupts the logic of Folk theorems.
23:672:48452:18:18:91:519:490:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In our theoretical section we propose a simple version of the CPR management model of Sekeris (2014),
23:673:48553:18:18:91:519:472:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:where players can opt for potentially costly conflict to share resources.  In such settings, infinite horizon
23:674:48662:18:18:91:519:454:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:dynamic games may endogenously become finite horizon strategic games up to the moment when conflict
23:675:48761:18:18:91:519:436:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:emerges,  after  which  the  problem  stops  being  strategic  and  instead  becomes  decision-theoretic.   In  this
23:676:48877:18:18:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:paper  we  inquire  experimentally  whether  participants  respond  to  such  incentives  that  should  lead  to  (i)
23:677:48994:18:17:91:519:400:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:less cooperation in the presence of high stocks of resources, and to (ii) conflict after the resource stock is
23:678:49104:17:18:91:520:383:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sufficiently depleted.  We find a strong and highly significant effect of the introduction of conflict (labelled

23:680:49321:18:18:91:519:347:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and non-cooperation.  In the early rounds of the game (i.e.  the first two rounds), participants reduce their
23:681:49430:18:18:91:519:329:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation by 14.7 percentage points and increase non-cooperation by 14.2 percentage points.  Given that
23:682:49535:18:18:91:519:311:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the average rates of cooperation and non-cooperation in the game’s two first rounds are around 34% and
23:683:49637:18:18:91:519:293:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and 66%, respectively, this equates, to a 43.2% decrease of cooperation, and to a 21.5% increase of non-
23:684:49741:18:18:91:141:275:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cooperation.
23:685:49753:18:18:106:519:257:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:To exclude the possibility that our results are driven by the fact that our participants had one option less
23:686:49861:18:18:91:519:239:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the control treatment compared to the conflict scenario, we additionally compare our results to a treatment
23:687:49971:18:18:91:519:221:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:featuring the same three options as in the conflict scenario, but with the difference that we impose a (theoreti-
23:688:50084:18:18:91:519:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cally) prohibitive cost of conflict. The results remain the same in qualitative terms: in the early rounds of the
23:689:50197:18:18:91:520:185:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:game in the treated group, cooperation decreases by 11.9 percentage points and non-cooperation increases
23:690:50301:18:18:91:520:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by the same percentage points.  We attribute the reduced magnitude of the coefficients to the fact that, in
23:691:50408:18:0:91:519:149:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:this control group where conflict is prohibitively costly, participants nevertheless did resort to conflict in an
24:692:50523:0:17:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(irrational) attempt to halt the degradation of resources when the stock of resources ran very low.  The ex-
24:693:50631:17:18:91:519:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:pectation of conflict therefore pushed participants to lower their levels of cooperation, but to a lesser degree
24:694:50743:18:18:91:519:651:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:than in the main conflict treatment where conflict is played both more frequently and in earlier rounds of the
24:695:50853:18:18:91:115:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:game.
24:696:50858:18:18:106:519:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:This contribution constitutes the first evidence that the fear of - possibly distant - conflicts over shared
24:697:50966:18:18:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:resources can hamper cooperation in the short run, and can thereby accelerate the depletion of the resources.

24:700:51284:18:43:91:436:543:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the strengthening of institutions and international bodies able to contain such violence.

34:990:61875:18:18:91:519:603:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in cash, privately, at the end of the session.  What you earn depends partly on your decisions, partly on the
34:991:61984:18:18:91:256:585:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:decisions of others, and partly on chance.
34:992:62026:18:18:106:271:567:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Please turn offall electronic devices now.
34:993:62068:18:18:106:519:549:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The entire experiment will take place through computer terminals.  Please do not talk or in any way try
34:994:62171:18:18:91:519:531:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to communicate with other participants until everybody has been told that the experiment is over and that
34:995:62276:18:18:91:186:513:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:you can leave the room.
34:996:62299:18:18:106:519:495:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We will now give you some time to carefully read the following instructions. If you have any questions,
34:997:62402:18:30:91:412:477:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:please raise your hand and your question will be answered so everyone can hear.
34:998:62481:30:18:91:183:447:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:Overview & Payment
34:999:62499:18:17:106:520:429:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In  this  experiment  you  will  playthe  same  game  20  times.   Each  time  you  play,  the  computer  will
34:1000:62609:17:18:91:519:412:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:randomly pair you up with someone else in the room (but you don’t know with whom).  So, in each game
34:1001:62709:18:18:91:520:394:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:you are paired with a random person in the room.  Thefirst 10 gamesyou play will be forpractice.  The
34:1002:62810:18:18:91:243:376:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:remaining 10 games will be for real.
34:1003:62846:18:18:106:519:358:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Each game lasts for at least 6 rounds.  After the 6thround, you will enter each next round with a proba-
34:1004:62950:18:18:91:519:340:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:bility of 70% (so with a 30% probability the game ends). So, if you happen to enter round 7, there is a 70%
34:1005:63057:18:18:91:314:322:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:share that you will enter round 8 and so on and so forth.
34:1006:63114:18:18:106:519:304:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:When you have played the game 10 times, each game lasting 6 or more rounds, you will be paid.  Your
34:1007:63213:18:18:91:519:286:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:payment has two components, aninitial endowment of£5 anda payment of£1.50per point won.  To
34:1008:63304:18:18:91:520:268:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f8:establish how many points you have won,  we will randomlydraw 2 of the last 10 games (the for-real
34:1009:63402:18:18:91:520:250:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:games)you played and pay you according to the amount of points you won in those games.  So, your final
34:1010:63504:18:36:91:360:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:payment will beyour initial endowmentplusyour points payment.
34:1011:63565:36:18:101:180:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Here is an example:
34:1012:63584:18:18:101:511:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Say, the random draws were games 4 and 6, and you won5.6 pointsand2.4 pointsin those games
34:1013:63674:18:0:101:413:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:respectively. Then your final payment would be:3+(5.6+2.4) x 1.50=£15.
35:1014:63746:0:17:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Depending on how you play and for how many rounds the game continues, it is possible that you will
35:1015:63844:17:36:91:261:669:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:get negative points, though this is unlikely.
35:1016:63889:36:18:101:201:633:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Here is another example:
35:1017:63913:18:18:101:510:615:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Say, the random draws were games 4 and 6, and you got-2.4 pointsand1.2 pointsin those games
35:1018:64004:18:37:101:423:597:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:respectively. Then your final payment would be:3+(-1.2+2.4) x 1.50=£4.80.
35:1019:64077:37:29:106:314:560:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:So, to conclude, the choices you make really matter.
35:1020:64129:29:18:91:156:531:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:Playing a game
35:1021:64143:18:18:106:519:513:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:At the beginning of each game, you and your opponent both start with a joint stock of 40 points.  Each
35:1022:64245:18:18:91:519:495:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:round, you can choose how much of this stock of points you want to take. Whatever you and your opponent
35:1023:64348:18:18:91:391:477:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:choose each round will affect how much stock there will be left next round.
35:1024:64423:18:18:106:519:459:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The game continues like this. In the second round you choose how much to take of the remaining stock
35:1025:64523:18:18:91:501:441:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and that will affect how much stock will be left in round 3, and so on and so forth, until the game ends.
35:1026:64628:18:18:106:333:423:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:So, there are two things to understand:choiceandstock.
35:1027:64682:18:25:91:164:405:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:Your choices are:

36:1048:65789:18:18:91:520:561:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is entirely left tochanceunder this scenario since you will not be making any more decisions after picking

36:1050:65907:18:18:106:519:525:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Playingchanceiscostly.  Once chance is chosen, a cost will be taken away from your joint stock.  The

36:1052:66106:18:18:91:519:489:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:subsequent rounds of chance mode.  Depending on the size of the current stock, this is how much playing

36:1056:66329:34:17:106:276:401:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:There is more to know about your choices:
36:1057:66370:17:18:91:519:384:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Thepoints that you takefrom the current stock each round are not exactly thepoints that you get to keep.
36:1058:66474:18:18:91:419:366:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:There is aformula, which describes how many points you get to keep each round.
36:1059:66552:18:18:91:519:348:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:This will involve some mathematics, i.e.  the natural logarithm.  If you don’t like maths, don’t worry about
36:1060:66660:18:18:91:520:330:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:understanding what logarithm means.  All you need to know is that thenatural logarithmofsomethingis
36:1061:66759:18:18:91:233:312:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:quite a bitlessthan thatsomething.
36:1062:66793:18:18:91:519:294:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f8:Anyway, the following table shows how this works.  Inround 1youget to keep the natural logarithm of
36:1063:66892:18:18:91:519:276:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:the points you decide to take. Inround 2you get70%of thenatural logarithm of the points you take.
36:1064:66989:18:18:91:520:258:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:In round 3, you get to keep70% of 70%of the natural logarithm of the points you took, and so on and so
36:1065:67091:18:33:91:297:240:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:forth. (Note that “ln” just means natural logarithm.)
36:1066:67144:33:18:101:195:207:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Here are two examples:
36:1067:67166:18:18:101:511:189:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Suppose you are in round 1, where your current stock is 40.  If you both choselow, the points you
36:1068:67263:18:18:101:510:171:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f8:would take would be 15% of 40 points (i.e.  6 points) each.  But you would only get to keep ln(points
36:1069:67364:18:0:101:232:153:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:you take), which is ln(6)≈1.79.

37:1077:67676:56:18:101:510:520:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Suppose again that you are in round 1,  where your current stock is 40.   If you choselowand your
37:1078:67773:18:18:101:511:502:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:opponent chose high, you would again take 15% of 40 points (i.e.  6 points) and your opponent would
37:1079:67872:18:18:101:511:484:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:take 25.5% of 40 points (i.e. 10.2 points). Here you would only get to keep ln(points you take), which
37:1080:67974:18:38:101:375:466:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:is ln(6)≈1.79 and your opponent would get to keep ln(10.2)=2.32.
37:1081:68038:38:17:106:519:428:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Now, if you remember,after round 6 there is only a 70% probabilityof getting into each subsequent
37:1082:68135:17:18:91:520:411:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:round.   To be precise,  at the end of each roundafter round 6the computer software will roll a virtual,
37:1083:68239:18:18:91:469:393:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:100-sided dice and will end the game if a number higher than 70 comes up on that virtual dice.
37:1084:68333:18:18:106:520:375:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:This has aneffect onthepoints you get to keep from round 7 onwards. From Round 7 onwards, you
37:1085:68426:18:18:91:519:357:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f8:and your opponent can make the same choices as previously but nowyou continuously get to keep 17%
