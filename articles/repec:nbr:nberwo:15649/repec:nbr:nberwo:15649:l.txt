2:26:1056:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:Medical care at the end of life, estimated to contribute up to a quarter of US health care spending,
2:27:1156:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:often encounters skepticism from payers and policy makers who question its high cost and often minimal
2:28:1258:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:health benefits.  However, though many observers have claimed that such spending is often irrational
2:29:1358:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:and wasteful, little explicit analysis exists on the incentives that determine end of life health care spending.
2:30:1470:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:This paper attempts to provide the first rational and systematic analysis of the incentives behind end
2:31:1572:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:of life care.  The main argument we make is that existing theoretical and empirical analysis of the
2:32:1671:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:value of life do not apply, and often under-values, the value of life near its end and terminal care. We
2:33:1775:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:argue that several factors drive up the value of life near its end including the low opportunity cost
2:34:1876:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:of medical spending  near ones death, the value of hope including living into new innovations, and
2:35:1974:14:14:72:539:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:the potential positive effect of on the value of life from being frail. We calibrate the ex-post value of
2:36:2079:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:?:hope associated with treatments for HIV patients to be as much as four times as high as standard per-
2:37:2178:14:14:72:538:434:12:Times:12:Times:?:capita estimates of treatment effects and as many as two and a half times as high as aggregate values
2:38:2278:14:42:72:157:420:12:Times:12:Times:?:across all cohorts.

3:68:2904:13:14:90:93:695:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
3:69:2904:14:14:126:523:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?:Medical care at the end of life often encounters skepticism from payers and policy 
3:70:2987:14:14:90:497:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:makers who question its high cost and often minimal health benefits.   Indeed, many 
3:71:3071:14:14:90:497:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies have found that about a quarter of overall life-time spending on medical care 
3:72:3157:14:13:90:509:639:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:occurs in an individual’s last year of life, regardless of whether that care is privately or 
3:73:3250:13:14:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:publicly financed (Hogan et al. 2000; Lubitz and Riley 1993). It seems generally agreed 
3:74:3338:14:14:90:502:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:upon that medical resources are being wasted on excessive end-of-life treatments that 
3:75:3424:14:14:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:often only minimally prolong an already frail life. This excessive care at the end of life 
3:76:3515:14:14:90:513:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:affects the overall distribution of health care spending as it is highly skewed, driving up 
3:77:3607:14:13:90:515:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lifetime average spending levels many times. For example, it has estimated that close to 
3:78:3696:13:14:90:508:557:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:half of the overall spending on old individuals in the US stems from the top 5 % of the 
3:79:3784:14:14:90:303:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spending distribution (Garber et al (1998)).  
3:80:3830:14:14:90:93:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
3:81:3830:14:14:90:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:From an economic standpoint, it may seem obvious that much of this extreme end-of-life 
3:82:3917:14:13:90:519:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spending is irrational since the value of a life year is often estimated to be in the range of 
3:83:4012:13:14:90:517:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:$100 thousand, but overall spending to extend life a few months near death can be in the 
3:84:4101:14:14:90:515:474:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:millions. It can be argued that this vast misallocation of resources, induced by excessive 
3:85:4192:14:14:90:519:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:end of life health care, has important consequences for the overall economy since end-of-
3:86:4281:14:14:90:462:446:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:life care makes up a substantial share of overall healthcare spending which is 
3:87:4360:14:13:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approximately 16% of the economy. This alleged over-spending on terminal care also has 
3:88:4447:13:14:90:517:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:important implications for the public programs that pay for much of this end of life care, 
3:89:4538:14:14:90:500:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(such as the US’s Medicare for the old and Medicaid for the poor), as well funds like 
3:90:4624:14:14:90:503:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Social Security, which must continue paying out over longer, but lower quality, lives. 
3:91:4711:14:14:90:99:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:   
3:92:4714:14:13:90:478:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Even though many observers have claimed that such spending is often futile and 
3:93:4793:13:14:90:490:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wasteful, it persists and is growing in both the private and public sectors. This may 
3:94:4879:14:14:90:516:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicate that there are some less understood benefits of end-of-life care, and presumably 
3:95:4969:14:14:90:520:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:larger than the often discussed costs.  Indeed, little explicit and systematic analysis exists 
3:96:5064:14:13:90:504:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the incentives that determine end-of-life care.  We argue that a positive analysis of 
3:97:5153:13:14:90:505:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:why and when high levels of terminal care spending occur is a prerequisite before any 
3:98:5239:14:14:90:521:281:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:normative claims can be made or any policy proposals aimed at limiting such care can be 
3:99:5327:14:14:90:246:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:justified on an efficiency basis.  
3:100:5362:14:14:126:129:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?: 
3:101:5362:14:13:90:505:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we attempt to provide a rational choice analysis of the incentives behind 
3:102:5451:13:14:90:509:226:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:end of life care.  The main argument we make is that existing theoretical and empirical 
3:103:5539:14:14:90:488:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analyses of the value of a life do not apply to the valuation of life near its end and, 
3:104:5627:14:14:90:517:198:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, do not apply to the demand for terminal care.  In particular, that several forces 
3:105:5720:14:14:90:484:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:operate which makes the value of end of life care higher than previously argued.   
3:106:5803:14:13:89:92:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
3:107:5803:13:14:89:518:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:First, if resources have no value when dead, a self-interested individual would be willing 
3:108:5894:14:14:89:523:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to forego his entire wealth to extend his life when dying, even if only for a few months. A 
3:109:5986:14:14:89:522:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantial amount of spending on futile care is rational when there is little-to-no value of 
3:110:6080:14:14:89:519:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leaving wealth behind. The desire to spend one’s wealth on terminal care is supported by 
3:111:6169:14:13:89:515:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:existing evidence that a large share, up to a half, of personal bankruptcies are associated 
3:112:6261:13:0:89:523:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with unforeseen health care spending, often taking place when faced with life-threatening 
4:113:6351:0:13:90:509:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:diseases (Himmelstein (2005)). We argue that living, like other goods, has diminishing 
4:114:6438:13:14:90:519:695:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:marginal utility--the willingness to pay for an additional year of life falls with how many 
4:115:6530:14:14:90:492:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:years one has to live.  This is in contrast to how the value of a statistical life-year is 
4:116:6621:14:14:89:524:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:taught and explained: it is often prefaced with claiming that it is not how much people are 
4:117:6713:14:14:89:482:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:willing to pay to avoid having a gun put to their head (presumably one’s wealth). 
4:118:6795:14:13:89:412:639:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:However, terminal care decisions are often exactly of that nature.   
4:119:6864:13:14:89:92:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:120:6864:14:14:89:522:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, we argue that an important ignored component of spending on end-of-life care is 
4:121:6952:14:14:89:521:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the preservation of hope of living which then raises valuation of life. We define the value 
4:122:7044:14:14:89:505:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of hope explicitly as the current consumption of future survival. If a patient is given a 
4:123:7134:14:13:89:516:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:death sentence in 6 months, he values those 6 months less than if he knew he would live 
4:124:7222:13:14:89:522:557:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:after that. The fear of knowing that the end is near is a bad, as is often revealed by people 
4:125:7316:14:14:89:475:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preferring a quick accidental death. We derive how this value of hope raises the 
4:126:7397:14:14:89:513:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:willingness to pay for what appears as futile treatments. Related to such a value of hope 
4:127:7487:14:14:89:493:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is the option value of living to utilize a newly discovered treatment before one dies. 
4:128:7574:14:13:89:488:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, many celebrities, e.g. Michael J. Fox and the late Christopher Reeve, have 
4:129:7657:13:14:89:521:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:invested large shares of their own wealth into speeding up the discovery of a cure for this

4:132:7761:14:14:89:520:446:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Third, the social value of terminal care is often greater than the private value of the same 
4:133:7854:14:13:89:509:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:treatments.  However, existing analysis of the value of a life year mostly consider only 
4:134:7943:13:14:90:519:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private valuation. If the extension of a given person’s life has positive external effects on 
4:135:8037:14:14:90:494:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:others (family members, tax-payers who do not tolerate letting poor people die), we 
4:136:8121:14:14:89:516:391:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would estimate and observe more spending than what is privately optimal. Since private 
4:137:8208:14:14:89:500:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:willingness to pay for life extension is limited by one’s wealth, the mere existence of 
4:138:8296:14:13:89:524:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Medicaid seems inconsistent with a private valuation approach being relevant, as it would 
4:139:8386:13:14:89:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be infeasible for those patients to pay for the end-of-life care that they receive. Indeed, 
4:140:8478:14:14:89:519:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:most rich countries don’t tolerate poor people dying when existing technologies can save 
4:141:8567:14:14:89:140:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:them.        
4:142:8580:14:13:89:92:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:143:8580:13:14:89:507:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Fourth, we argue that the rational level of terminal care for frail patients is often larger 
4:144:8673:14:14:89:517:281:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than commonly believed. In particular, we show when the value of terminal care may be 
4:145:8759:14:14:89:508:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the same regardless of the “quality” of life experienced by the patient. Therefore, even 
4:146:8848:14:14:89:506:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:though a person may be frail and in very poor health, it may still be rational for him to 
4:147:8938:14:13:89:500:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value life-extending terminal care as much as a perfectly healthy person. This differs 
4:148:9025:13:14:89:518:226:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from a vast health economic literature arguing that there is less value in prolonging a life 
4:149:9118:14:14:89:531:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of lower quality, the driving assumption of “quality-adjusted life-year” (QALY) analysis.    
4:150:9211:14:14:89:92:198:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:151:9211:14:14:89:520:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Because of all of these factors, the value of terminal care may exceed the levels currently 
4:152:9303:14:13:89:524:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attributed. To empirically assess the importance of one of these factors, the value of hope, 
4:153:9396:13:14:89:505:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we calibrate the option value of new innovation associated with terminal care for HIV 
4:154:9482:14:14:89:511:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:patients in the 1990s. We find that the ex-post value of hope associated with treatments 
4:155:9571:14:14:89:515:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for HIV patients to be as much as four times larger than standard estimates.   The option 
4:156:9661:14:14:89:515:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value is largest when treatments enabled patients before the breakthrough of HAART in 
4:157:9747:14:13:89:467:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1996 to live to see that breakthrough.  Although it is clear that the tremendous 
4:158:9828:13:0:89:503:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:breakthroughs in HIV may be atypical of medical progress across the board, they still 
5:159:9914:0:13:90:475:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:serve as a useful case to illustrate how one can quantify this value of hope more 
5:160:9996:13:14:90:171:695:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:systematically.

5:163:10103:14:14:90:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:life. Section 3 discusses how the value of hope raises spending. Section 4 discusses how 
5:164:10192:14:13:90:517:639:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:altruism within and across families affects terminal care.  Section 5 discusses the impact 
5:165:10283:13:14:90:499:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of quality of life on rational terminal care. Section 6 considers the unusual aspects of 
5:166:10372:14:14:90:511:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D into new terminal care technologies. Section 7 provides our calibrations for HIV. 
5:167:10458:14:14:90:226:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Lastly, section 8 concludes.

5:198:11336:14:14:89:464:262:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:This infra-marginal valuation formula3 differs from the existing value-of-life 
5:199:11415:14:14:90:511:248:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:methodology used in the empirical literature which only considers marginal changes in 
5:200:11501:14:13:90:477:234:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:life expectancy. This basic definition has remarkably strong implications for the 
5:201:11583:13:14:90:489:221:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:economic value of raising survival for people who are near the end of their life.  In 
5:202:11669:14:14:90:516:207:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:particular, consider the value of a gain in survival to S’ for an individual who is near the 
5:203:11762:14:14:90:520:193:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:end of his life, approximated by his existing survival function satisfying S = 0. The value 
5:204:11854:14:13:90:234:179:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of this survival gain satisfies:

5:208:11972:8:17:90:510:128:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2An analogous argument occurs if the individual is asked to value a probability distribution over a set of 
5:209:12079:17:12:90:290:111:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:feasible survival functions induced by treatment.

6:214:12240:13:14:90:509:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:This extreme implication states that an individual is willing to pay his entire wealth for 
6:215:12331:14:14:90:501:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:any gain in survival, no matter how small the improval.  Put differently, if there is no 
6:216:12420:14:14:90:514:667:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of leaving resources behind when dead, an individual is willing to spend all of his 
6:217:12510:14:14:90:519:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:wealth to prolong life, even if just briefly.  This is an extreme implication induced by the 
6:218:12603:14:13:89:478:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:complementarity between consumption and longevity (see Dow et al (1999)); as 
6:219:12680:13:14:89:506:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:consumption is worthless without life, all of it would be sacrificed to gain more life.

6:221:12771:14:14:90:522:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:More generally, there may be inherent non-linearity in the valuation of life. The marginal 
6:222:12862:14:14:89:519:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of an additional life year will likely fall the more life one has left. This implies that 
6:223:12958:14:13:90:512:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the value of big changes in survival cannot be as easily inferred from the value of small 
6:224:13048:13:14:89:519:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:changes in survival. There is an implicit linearity assumption when the existing literature 
6:225:13140:14:14:89:515:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:aggregates marginal valuations to estimate the value of life-improvements. Consider the 
6:226:13228:14:14:89:523:529:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:common practice of infra-marginal valuation through multiplying life-years gained with a 
6:227:13317:14:13:89:517:515:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:constant marginal value of a life-year, say, $100 thousand. To illustrate simply, consider 
6:228:13408:13:14:89:465:502:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the canonical consumption problem above in the case of no discounting and a 
6:229:13484:14:14:89:495:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:deterministic lifetime. In this case, the indirect utility function is made of T years of 
6:230:13574:14:14:89:412:474:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:consumption of the overall wealth Y split up over the T years as in

6:239:13839:14:14:90:518:347:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:then there is no value of life. This is the case when utility is proportional to consumption 
6:240:13932:14:13:90:481:333:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:(u=ac) so that the indirect utility only depends on wealth, V=aY. In this case, the

7:268:14740:14:14:90:522:393:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:In the example above, it can be shown4 that when u is concave, the marginal value of life

7:280:15318:14:14:90:500:227:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Many observers of end-of-life care claim that some notion of “hope” is important for

7:282:15494:13:14:90:516:200:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:“selling hope” is often easy, not because of the actual health benefits of such treatments, 
7:283:15586:14:14:89:513:186:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:but because of the low opportunity cost, when there is little benefit from leaving wealth

7:290:15835:15:23:90:506:112:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5 For example, when the utility function takes the constant elasticity form, , then the indirect 
7:291:15932:23:15:90:518:89:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:utility function takes the Cobb-Douglas form VY()=T1−aYa which displays the traditional declining 
7:292:16030:15:0:90:352:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:marginal rate of substitution with the levels of the two “goods”.   
8:293:16098:0:13:90:523:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:However, there is an aspect of hope that seems important to doctors and care-givers.   We 
8:294:16188:13:14:90:523:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:formalize the value of hope as stemming from the current consumption of future survival: 
8:295:16277:14:14:90:519:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the person values knowing today that there is chance of living tomorrow. If certain death 
8:296:16367:14:14:90:518:667:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:was known to prevail tomorrow, the person would be without hope today and, therefore, 
8:297:16453:14:14:90:493:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:enjoy living less.  Living life under a death sentence is a “bad” as reflected in many 
8:298:16540:14:13:90:523:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:sentiments that people would prefer to die in sudden accidents over living with a terminal

9:373:19943:14:14:90:500:385:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:This simple analysis has several direct implications for the demand for terminal care. 
9:374:20030:14:14:90:498:371:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:First, it generally predicts that, holding the effectiveness of current treatments (S’-S) 
9:375:20120:14:14:90:517:357:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:constant, factors that increase the rate of future innovation will also increase the demand 
9:376:20212:14:13:90:478:343:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:for terminal care. One such factor would be a larger, more promising pipeline of 
9:377:20293:13:14:90:498:330:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:treatments being investigated for future market approval. Another may be the size or 
9:378:20378:14:14:90:504:316:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:prevalence of the disease, since increased patient base raises R&D incentives. Also, it 
9:379:20466:14:14:90:505:302:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:seems reasonable to assume that lack of treatment discoveries in the past would lower 
9:380:20552:14:14:90:515:288:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectations of immediate discoveries now.  Compared to a novel disease, if it has been 
9:381:20640:14:13:90:511:274:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:40 years without any huge breakthroughs, it would seem less likely that a breakthrough 
9:382:20727:13:14:90:482:261:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:will occur in the next year.  This would lead to the prediction that the demand for 
9:383:20811:14:14:90:459:247:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:terminal care treatments would rise in the novelty of the disease, holding the 
9:384:20890:14:14:90:311:233:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effectiveness of current treatments constant.   
9:385:20938:14:14:90:93:219:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
9:386:20938:14:13:90:520:205:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the option value would also predict that individuals would be willing to sacrifice 
9:387:21029:13:14:90:494:192:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:quality of life for longer survival.  This non-standard impact on the quality-quantity 
9:388:21116:14:14:90:523:178:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:tradeoff of living is predicted because living a frail life to see a new cure is more valuable 
9:389:21211:14:21:90:228:164:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:than a shorter healthier life.

9:391:21291:8:19:90:498:135:64:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:6 It is worthwhile noting that this option value implies that randomized clinical trials 
9:392:21380:19:14:90:513:116:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:where future treatments are not incorporated yield biased estimates of the full treatment 
9:393:21470:14:14:89:242:102:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effect. That is, S’C -SC ≠ S’-S.

10:397:21504:13:14:90:522:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Third, the option value of future cures may also lead one to predict a risk-loving behavior 
10:398:21596:14:14:90:521:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:when deciding between treatments with different survival distributions. This occurs if the 
10:399:21687:14:14:89:524:667:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:loss in the left-hand side is outweighed by the gain in survival in the right-hand tail, made 
10:400:21781:14:14:90:513:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:more valuable due to expected future innovations. Having a 10 percent chance of living 
10:401:21868:14:13:89:509:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:10 years and 90 percent chance dying immediately may be more valuable than living 1 
10:402:21952:13:14:89:499:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:year for certain. In other words, treatments with the same mean survival or treatment 
10:403:22038:14:14:89:505:612:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effect may differ in value since larger variances raise the chance of living into a cure.  
10:404:22129:14:14:89:92:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
10:405:22129:14:14:89:496:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:In general, these demand predictions may occur on the extensive margin (number of 
10:406:22211:14:13:89:523:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:patients treated) or on the intensive margin (compliance). For example, one would predict 
10:407:22301:13:14:89:524:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that as breakthrough drugs enter the last phases of the FDA approval process, both uptake 
10:408:22391:14:14:89:510:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:and compliance on current marginal drugs would increase due to patients hoping to see

10:413:22572:14:14:90:93:474:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
10:414:22572:14:14:90:496:460:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:It is often argued that life-extension should be allocated towards individuals in good 
10:415:22659:14:14:90:505:446:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:health rather than those in poor health. In this section we analyze the value of life as a 
10:416:22750:14:13:90:498:432:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:function of the level of health or “quality” of life. We find that terminal care is often 
10:417:22840:13:14:90:507:419:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:more rational for frail patients than commonly believed. Even though a person may be 
10:418:22925:14:14:90:500:405:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:frail and in very poor health, it may still be rational for him to value life-extension as 
10:419:23016:14:14:90:521:391:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:much as a perfectly healthy person. An extreme case of this is the analysis above where a 
10:420:23106:14:14:90:492:377:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:person is willing to spend his entire wealth for extra life, regardless of whether that 
10:421:23194:14:13:90:236:363:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:individual is frail or healthy.

10:433:23624:14:14:126:525:188:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:?:This has the direct implication that quality of life has two offsetting effects on the 
10:434:23711:14:14:90:526:174:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value  of  life  (see  also  Murphy  and  Topel  (2003)).  First,  quality  raises  the  value  of  life  
10:435:23817:14:13:90:525:160:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:(left-hand side) by raising the level of utility under the improved survival, A’, since living 
10:436:23912:13:14:90:527:147:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:longer  is  enjoyed  more  when  the  quality  of  that  life  is  higher.  However,  as  a  second  
10:437:24013:14:14:90:524:133:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effect, it also raises the value of the remaining life at the lower survival (right-hand side). 
10:438:24109:14:14:90:525:119:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, a higher quality of life means the new life is enjoyed more but also means the 
10:439:24199:14:14:90:526:105:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:old  life  is  better  as  well.  The  second  effect  is  due  to  quality  increasing  the  amount  of  
10:440:24305:14:13:90:524:91:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:foregone consumption needed to finance life extension. Depending on the cross partial of 
10:441:24394:13:0:90:526:78:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:U  and  the  complementarity  between  consumption  and  quality  of  life,  the  value  of  life,  
11:442:24494:0:13:90:524:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:v(q), may be falling or rising in the quality of life. As the quality of life has indeterminate

11:458:25300:13:14:90:518:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:person, e.g. parents saving their child, raises the value of life since people, other than the

12:500:27488:13:14:90:498:527:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Clearly an important contributor to the high level of spending on terminal care is the 
12:501:27575:14:14:90:491:513:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:public subsidization of demand (in the United States, mostly through Medicare and 
12:502:27657:14:14:90:497:499:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Medicaid). To consider the determinants of the size of public subsidies, consider the 
12:503:27743:14:14:89:509:485:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) insurance that finances most health care spending in the 
12:504:27828:14:13:89:493:471:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:developed world.  Particularly for the poor, the demand subsidy through third-party 
12:505:27912:13:14:89:500:458:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:financing is clearly an important factor in determining the high level of terminal care 
12:506:28000:14:14:89:515:444:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:spending. This is a natural extension of the analysis above, but now each parent is being 
12:507:28090:14:14:89:467:430:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:subsidized by the average child in the economy as opposed to their own child. 
12:508:28168:14:14:89:92:416:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
12:509:28168:14:13:89:495:402:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:The classic effects of any demand subsidies are, of course, to raise the supply-price, 
12:510:28255:13:14:89:522:389:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:lower the demand-price, and increase quantity. Consequently, terminal care spending, the 
12:511:28344:14:14:89:516:375:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:product of supply-price and quantity, will be positively affected by demand subsidies7.

12:513:28434:14:14:89:521:347:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:However, we argue here that there exists evidence suggesting that, even in the absence of 
12:514:28524:14:13:89:523:333:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:demand subsidies, the level of terminal care spending would be higher than accounted for 
12:515:28613:13:14:89:522:320:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:by existing value-of-life estimates.  Indeed, there is a large literature in health economics, 
12:516:28708:14:14:89:510:306:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the most prominent early study being the RAND Health Insurance Experiment8, which 
12:517:28790:14:14:89:516:292:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:attempted to estimate the effect of co-pays on health care spending. Interpreting co-pays 
12:518:28880:14:14:89:516:278:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:as unsubsidized care, this literature has implications for the counterfactual spending that 
12:519:28972:14:13:89:513:264:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:would take place in absence of demand subsidies9. In general, if it is estimated that non-
12:520:29062:13:14:90:521:251:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:subsidized care is a certain percent of subsidized care, then terminal care spending would 
12:521:29153:14:14:90:500:237:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:be predicted to be the same percentage of observed subsidized levels. But even when 
12:522:29237:14:14:90:485:223:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:discounting spending due to subsidies in this manner, it appears that terminal care 
12:523:29321:14:15:90:520:209:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:spending is larger than common estimates of the value of a life.  For example, even if we

12:525:29459:8:16:90:513:186:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:7 Demand subsidies for health care in many countries, including Medicare and Medicaid in the US, differ 
12:526:29563:16:7:90:458:170:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:from classic demand subsidies in that they also involve third-party (administrative) pricing. 
12:527:29657:7:18:90:521:163:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8 Other more recent studies on the effect of public demand subsidies include Card, et al (2004), Finkelstein 
12:528:29765:18:11:89:516:145:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:et al (2005).   The RAND experiment is not well suited to study the effects of public subsidies on terminal 
12:529:29873:11:14:89:480:134:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:care, as it had caps on out of pocket spending that were likely met  for expensive terminal care.    
12:530:29974:14:7:90:93:120:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
12:531:29974:7:16:90:511:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9 Indeed, The RAND Health Insurance Experiment was ideally suited to studying public subsidization as 
12:532:30076:16:12:90:491:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:premiums were never collected by participants, mimicking the effects of differentially generous tax-
12:533:30176:12:11:90:523:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:financed plans. The experiment offers less evidence on the demand for insurance, but rather the demand for 
12:534:30283:11:0:90:332:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:ex-post care given a randomly determined insurance policy. 
13:535:30342:0:13:90:504:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:assume that for every 100 thousand dollars spent on publicly funded terminal care, 50 
13:536:30428:13:14:89:510:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:thousand would be spent without public subsidies, spending levels on terminal care are 
13:537:30515:14:14:89:496:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:many times higher than existing value of life estimates. Therefore, this suggests that 
13:538:30602:14:14:89:514:667:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:using standard co-pay estimates to predict unsubsidized demand may not alter our basic 
13:539:30689:14:14:89:521:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:argument. This is particularly true if, as often is estimated, acute hospital inpatient care is 
13:540:30785:14:13:89:480:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:less elastic to co-pays than is other forms of care, perhaps for exactly the reasons 
13:541:30870:13:14:89:206:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:discussed in this paper.

13:543:30896:14:14:89:523:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:The overall analysis of PAYG insured terminal care is analogous to multiple children and 
13:544:30985:14:14:89:495:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:parents who exhibit heterogeneous altruism towards each others, where presumably 
13:545:31066:14:13:89:514:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:within-family altruism is stronger than across-family altruism. Therefore, such altruistic 
13:546:31157:13:14:89:497:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:and PAYG financed terminal care have many analogous features to the analysis of a 
13:547:31239:14:14:89:519:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:single family before. Again, it is the relative altruism of the old relative to the young that

13:551:31603:14:14:89:495:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:deficits, then optimal spending levels may be well beyond the average wealth of the

13:557:31834:14:14:89:507:405:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:individuals through insurance. The previous analysis considered the ex-post allocation

13:560:32092:14:13:90:498:363:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:future disease occurrence involving expensive terminal care. This will determine the 
13:561:32177:13:14:89:507:350:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:willingness to pay for an insurance policy that covers terminal care if it is necessary in 
13:562:32268:14:14:89:501:336:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the future. Efficient insurance of terminal care does not tradeoff living against dying. 
13:563:32357:14:14:89:475:322:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Rather, it trades off current consumption against terminal care in the future and, 
13:564:32440:14:13:89:506:308:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, may limit spending compared to uninsured spending. This is a non-standard

13:580:33511:14:0:90:523:83:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:willingness to pay for terminal care is not equal to the individual’s level of wealth (v <Y). 
14:581:33605:0:13:90:513:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:This is of course because the individual trades off other uses of wealth when making an

14:590:34018:14:14:90:487:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Our analysis above analyzes the high value of terminal care given the existence of 
14:591:34101:14:13:90:521:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:technologies to extend life when it is threatened. This section considers the incentives for 
14:592:34194:13:14:90:518:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:medical R&D to bring such technologies to market in the first place. The major issue we 
14:593:34282:14:14:90:482:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:will discuss is how the presence of altruism affects optimal R&D into life-saving

14:596:34380:14:13:90:519:501:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:We have previously discussed the difference between the social and private value of life, 
14:597:34470:13:14:90:513:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:given the existence of a technology. There is an important aspect of the altruistic nature 
14:598:34561:14:14:90:484:474:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of care for life-threatening conditions which concerns the desire to avoid denying 
14:599:34644:14:14:90:519:460:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:treatments to dying patients. This is certainly one of several reasons that such high levels 
14:600:34737:14:14:90:474:446:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of terminal care spending exist. Indeed, doctors often express concerns that it is 
14:601:34820:14:13:90:478:432:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:“unethical” to deny any patient the use of existing technology in life-threatening 
14:602:34903:13:14:90:497:419:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:situations, which has led to sharp disagreements between doctors and economists on 
14:603:34986:14:14:90:522:405:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:appropriate levels of care. Terminal care is perhaps the starkest example of this issue. We 
14:604:35078:14:14:90:518:391:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:here stress that such preferences may easily be incorporated into classical utility analysis 
14:605:35171:14:13:90:503:377:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:but have unrecognized implications for the appropriate speed of technological change 
14:606:35256:13:14:90:497:364:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:over time and, hence, for the appropriate change in health care spending over time.

14:609:35432:14:14:90:519:322:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:technology over denying the same care in the presence of a technology. This may be due 
14:610:35519:14:16:90:515:308:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:to higher levels of consumed “guilt” when denying care in presence of a technology.  In

14:612:35690:14:14:90:515:278:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:when not using the developed technology. Now let N denote the social surplus when the 
14:613:35776:14:16:90:501:264:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:technology is not developed at all (and cannot be denied to patients). We assume that 
14:614:35862:16:14:90:507:248:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:there is a social surplus from using the technology if it gets developed:W. This 
14:615:35943:14:14:89:514:234:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:surplus that occurs once the technology is out there may come from patients themselves

14:617:36119:13:17:89:511:207:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that not using a developed technology or not having it developed would entail the same

15:653:37984:17:16:90:519:373:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:pre-innovation surplus W is the welfare for which the price is sufficiently high to make

15:657:38160:19:14:90:525:343:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:extent to which denial of care leads to guilt, determines how socially efficient R&D, quite 
15:658:38252:14:16:90:505:329:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:different from traditionally discussed efficient levels of R&D.  Thus, when there is no 
15:659:38340:16:14:90:472:313:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:guilt from denying care,N=W0, then the ex-post surplus guides optimal R&D 
15:660:38414:14:14:89:518:299:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:investment in a standard manner. At the other extreme, guilt consumed could be so large 
15:661:38502:14:16:89:519:285:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that optimal use of the technology when developed is actually dominated by no use of an

15:663:38667:16:14:89:484:253:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:demanded ex-post and may generate a traditional surplus above the level of R&D 
15:664:38746:14:13:89:517:239:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:undertaken, that R&D may be inefficient. In the intermediary case, consumption of guilt 
15:665:38834:13:14:89:506:226:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:when denying care lowers the value of R&D. Put simply: what appears as valuable ex-
15:666:38917:14:14:89:503:212:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:post usage of expensive terminal care technologies does not necessarily warrant more 
15:667:39002:14:14:89:493:198:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:R&D to develop them. The consumption of guilt when denying care implies that an 
15:668:39082:14:14:89:484:184:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:innovation does not merely result in a price reduction, as commonly perceived by 
15:669:39163:14:13:89:409:170:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:economists, but also represents a shift in the social demand curve.

15:672:39279:7:16:90:487:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:12 This separates denial aversion from the aversion to deny care due to tort law, so called defensive 
15:673:39381:16:12:89:521:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:medicine.  Denial aversion concerns states with different technology as opposed to defensive medicine that 
15:674:39488:12:7:89:335:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:concerns different care given the existence of a technology.

16:676:39661:0:13:90:519:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, this aspect of technological change has important implications for the worldwide 
16:677:39750:13:14:90:521:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:incidence of R&D. For example, in the area of drug development, the US makes up more 
16:678:39835:14:14:90:515:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:than half of world sales, even though US is only about a fifth of world output.  This fact 
16:679:39926:14:14:90:515:667:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:is often used to argue that US markets drive drug R&D spending in the US or elsewhere 
16:680:40012:14:14:90:509:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:and therefore subsidize other nations where markets for medical technologies are more 
16:681:40098:14:13:90:518:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:regulated. However, when denial of care induces consumption of guilt, countries outside

16:684:40362:14:14:89:514:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:presence. In other words, there may be negative, as opposed to positive, external effects 
16:685:40452:14:14:89:281:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of US-driven technological change.

16:688:40581:14:14:89:521:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:more insurance coverage in the US, despite the fact that both private and public coverage 
16:689:40671:14:14:89:519:529:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:has been rising over time. The greater lack of insurance in the 1970s or 1980s was not as 
16:690:40761:14:13:89:497:515:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:unacceptable as today because there was less denied care back then. Now with more 
16:691:40843:13:14:89:515:502:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:technological change and the feasibility to deny existing technologies for the uninsured,

16:696:41061:14:13:90:93:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:F: 
16:697:41061:13:14:90:496:419:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we estimate the value of hope from living into future innovation. We 
16:698:41147:14:14:90:509:405:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:consider patients with HIV before the new break through medicines were developed in 
16:699:41231:14:14:90:504:391:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the 1990s.  Before these breakthroughs occurred, we show that there was a significant 
16:700:41317:14:14:90:510:377:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of receiving terminal care that only marginally improved survival as this enabled 
16:701:41405:14:13:90:508:363:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:patients to live long enough to see breakthrough treatments that came on the market in 
16:702:41492:13:14:90:500:350:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1997. Our major finding is that the ex-post option value was as much as 400% of the 
16:703:41576:14:14:90:524:336:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:traditionally determined value of the marginal therapies used.  The great breakthroughs in 
16:704:41667:14:14:90:501:322:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:HIV may be atypical of medical progress generally, but they serve as a useful case to 
16:705:41753:14:13:90:456:308:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:illustrate how one can quantify the discussed benefits of terminal care more 
16:706:41830:13:14:90:171:295:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:systematically.

16:709:41942:14:14:90:522:253:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:once diagnosed with AIDS. In April 1987, mono-therapy zidovudine (AZT) was licensed 
16:710:42026:14:13:90:513:239:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:and soon became widely available as the first antiretroviral drug that improved survival 
16:711:42115:13:14:90:481:226:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:(Fischl et al. 1987; McLeod and Hammer 1992). However, the improvement was 
16:712:42190:14:14:90:522:212:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:marginal, ranging from several months to 1.6 years (Lemp et al. 1990; Moore et al. 1991;

16:714:42362:14:14:90:500:184:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:therapy) emerged as a major breakthrough for AIDS treatment and has improved life 
16:715:42444:14:13:90:511:170:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy of AIDS patients markedly, by around 10 years (Walensky et al. 2006; The

16:717:42607:14:14:90:515:143:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:diagnosed between April 1987 and 1997 had a choice of whether to receive AZT or not.

17:745:43417:14:14:90:513:307:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1995 corresponding to the theoretical discussion of the option value in section 3.1.  The 
17:746:43507:14:14:90:502:293:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:first survival curve S is for patients who received no treatment for their disease.  This 
17:747:43597:14:14:90:499:279:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:survival curve is the lowest of the five with only 47% of patients surviving their first 
17:748:43686:14:13:90:524:265:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:year.  The next curve, S’, shows the survival of patients who were received AZT therapy.  
17:749:43776:13:14:90:503:252:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:As we will discuss later, these patients faced markedly higher survival in the first two 
17:750:43865:14:14:90:511:238:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:years of the disease, with 84% surviving the first year and 78% surviving to the second 
17:751:43953:14:14:90:491:224:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:year.  As discussed in the Appendix,  past these first two years their yearly (but not 
17:752:44040:14:14:90:504:210:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:cumulative) survival is the same as that for patients receiving no treatment.  The third 
17:753:44129:14:14:90:481:196:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:curve, SC, represents the survival patients would have faced if they had received 
17:754:44211:14:14:90:494:182:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:HAART from the beginning of their disease.  As shown in the figure, these patients 
17:755:44294:14:14:90:486:168:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:would have experienced markedly increased survival, with nearly 90% of patients 
17:756:44374:14:13:90:218:154:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:surviving their first year.

17:759:44490:14:14:90:512:113:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:However, as discussed in section 3.1, the total value of AZT should also reflect the fact 
17:760:44580:14:14:90:519:99:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that patients who received AZT had an increased probability of surviving long enough to 
17:761:44668:14:0:90:483:85:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:receive more effective therapies such as HAART.  The total value of AZT can be 
18:762:44747:0:15:90:508:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:explained through two additional curves shown in Figure 1.  The first, S1997, represents 
18:763:44836:15:14:89:508:693:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the survival for patients diagnosed in 1995 who received no treatment for their disease 
18:764:44924:14:13:90:517:679:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:until the introduction of HAART in 1997.  This curve mirrors the no treatment curve for 
18:765:45012:13:15:90:523:666:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the first two years and then diverges, reflecting the higher survival prospect these patients 
18:766:45106:15:15:89:502:651:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:faced after 1997.  is similar, except that it represents the survival of patients who 
18:767:45192:15:14:89:505:636:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:initially received AZT for two years, followed by HAART.  We consider two ways of 
18:768:45274:14:0:89:475:622:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:measuring the total value of AZT.  The first is simply the value of moving from

18:771:45369:16:15:111:501:606:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:?: , which captures the full  survival improvement from AZT, assuming those who 
18:772:45447:15:13:90:495:591:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:started with no treatment were healthy enough to benefit from HAART. Hence, this 
18:773:45528:13:15:90:497:578:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:reflects the increase in the probability patients would survive long enough to receive 
18:774:45615:15:18:90:511:563:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:HAART.  The second is the value of moving from S to , which is the total survival 
18:775:45697:18:13:89:518:545:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:improvement from HAART assuming that those not on AZT were not healthy enough to 
18:776:45778:13:19:89:501:532:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:benefit from HAART when it occurred. .  Figure 1 shows that in either case, the total 
18:777:45864:19:0:89:455:513:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of AZT is large, given the vast survival improvement in moving from

18:794:46671:14:14:90:501:357:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy anywhere from a few months to 1.6 years (Lemp et al. 1990; Moore et al. 
18:795:46754:14:14:90:518:343:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1991; Vella et al. 1992).  For HIV patients who progressed into AIDS between 1988 and 
18:796:46840:14:13:90:469:329:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1994, our results show that receiving AZT followed by HAART increased life 
18:797:46915:13:14:90:512:316:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy by slightly less than a year compared to receiving no treatment followed by 
18:798:47002:14:14:89:484:302:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:HAART.  However, for AIDS patients whose disease developed in 1995 or 1996, 
18:799:47078:14:14:90:518:288:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:receiving AZT followed by HAART nearly doubled life expectancy relative to receiving 
18:800:47163:14:14:89:523:274:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:no treatment followed by HAART.  These results are line with the basic finding that AZT 
18:801:47251:14:13:89:468:260:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:primarily impacts survival in the first two years of the disease(discussed in the 
18:802:47333:13:15:89:493:247:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix). It is also useful to note that between 1995 and 1996, life expectancy for 
18:803:47418:15:15:89:507:232:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:patients receiving no treatment followed by HAART () increased by roughly 1.75 
18:804:47497:15:14:89:508:217:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:years, while life expectancy for patients receiving AZT+HAART increased by slightly 
18:805:47581:14:13:89:518:203:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:less than 0.1 year.  The reason for this, as explained in detail in the Appendix, is because 
18:806:47674:13:14:89:515:190:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:in the first two years of disease, the difference between receiving no treatment and AZT 
18:807:47763:14:0:89:396:176:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:is much greater than the difference between AZT and HAART.

19:839:48806:13:14:90:486:502:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:no treatment (S) to AZT only (S’) to be worth $212,595 on a lifetime basis, which 
19:840:48888:14:14:89:519:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:represents the traditional value of AZT.  However, the full value of AZT must reflect the 
19:841:48978:14:14:89:515:474:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:fact that the drug helped patients survive to the introduction of more definitive therapies 
19:842:49070:14:18:89:480:460:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:such as HAART (moving from  to ).  As shown in Table 2, we find that 
19:843:49139:18:14:89:484:442:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:differences between the traditional and full value are small for patients diagnosed 
19:844:49223:14:14:89:491:428:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:between 1988 and 1994, which is not surprising, given the slight differences in life 
19:845:49308:14:14:89:517:414:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy for these two groups, as seen in Table 1.  However, for patients diagnosed in 
19:846:49397:14:13:89:521:400:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1995 and 1996, we find that the full value is roughly four times larger than the traditional 
19:847:49490:13:14:89:510:387:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value.  The option value is particularly large for these two cohorts because AZT has its 
19:848:49579:14:14:89:501:373:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:largest effects on survival in the first two years post-disease. Therefore, for these two 
19:849:49669:14:14:89:521:359:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:cohorts, it greatly increased the probability that these patients would survive long enough 
19:850:49761:14:14:89:499:345:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:to receive HAART.  Intriguingly, the full value of AZT fell slightly between 1995 to 
19:851:49846:14:18:89:522:331:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1996, from $912,082 to $836,370.  Since the full value of AZT represent movement from 
19:852:49932:18:12:114:515:313:100:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:?: to  ,  whether the full value increases from year to year depends on the relative 
19:853:50014:12:15:90:507:301:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:change in 1997 versus the change in 1997.  As previously discussed, between 1995 and 
19:854:50099:15:14:90:485:286:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:1996, life expectancy with no treatment plus HAART increased far more than life 
19:855:50179:14:16:90:519:272:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:expectancy with AZT plus HAART (Table 1).  This large increase in coupled with a 
19:856:50260:16:0:89:524:256:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:modest gain in  , is why the full value of AZT falls slightly between 1995 and 1996.

20:896:52027:14:14:90:506:407:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that under this method, the full value of AZT is much larger than the traditional value,

20:899:52289:13:15:90:523:366:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:monotonically increasing.  This is because changes in the full value of AZT are driven by 
20:900:52379:15:0:90:463:351:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:changes in S, which is constant, versus changes in , which is increasing.

20:916:53144:13:14:90:93:169:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
20:917:53144:14:14:90:516:155:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Though the high spending on medical care at the end of life often encounters skepticism 
20:918:53232:14:14:89:518:141:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:from payers and policy makers, few explanations have been offered as to its benefits and 
20:919:53321:14:14:89:493:127:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:why it persists and is rising.  We analyzed the incentives fueling spending levels on 
20:920:53407:14:13:89:502:113:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:terminal care that are larger than the existing theoretical and empirical analysis of the 
20:921:53497:13:14:89:511:100:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of life suggests. We stressed the low opportunity cost of spending near death, the 
20:922:53586:14:0:89:522:86:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:importance of hope, the social value of a life, as well as why frailty does not diminish the 
21:923:53679:0:13:90:509:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:value of a life.  We found that incorporating the value of hope for future innovation, in 
21:924:53769:13:14:89:521:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the case of HIV, raised valuations up to four times above standard valuations of marginal 
21:925:53859:14:14:89:148:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:treatments.

21:927:53872:14:14:89:521:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Our claim that the value of life may be much higher near its end than traditionally argued 
21:928:53963:14:13:89:508:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of course needs more careful empirical examination in future research. There are some 
21:929:54049:13:14:89:507:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:existing estimates suggesting that the value of life near its end may be relatively high.  
21:930:54140:14:14:89:506:612:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Peter Neumann and colleagues (2006) have found that new oncology treatments at the 
21:931:54223:14:14:89:506:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:end of life are valued at about $300 thousand per life year, nearly three times the most 
21:932:54312:14:14:89:507:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:commonly cited values of a life year of $100 thousand.  Moreover, the rapid uptake of 
21:933:54398:14:13:89:524:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:new and expensive end-of-life treatments by patients suggests that they are highly valued. 
21:934:54489:13:14:89:499:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Goldman et al (2007) provides evidence on the elasticity of the demand for specialty 
21:935:54574:14:14:89:503:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:drugs as a function of the co-pays of patients. They find that the demand for specialty 
21:936:54662:14:14:89:510:529:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:drugs and end-of-life biologics is less elastic to co-pays than other drugs. This may not 
21:937:54752:14:13:89:513:515:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:only explain the high prices charged by patent monopolies but also may have important 
21:938:54838:13:14:89:453:502:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:implications for the gross consumer surplus generated by these treatments.  
21:939:54914:14:14:89:92:488:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
21:940:54914:14:14:89:506:474:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Although our analysis was mainly positive, it has important normative implications as 
21:941:55000:14:14:89:486:460:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:well.  In particular, it has strong implications for using traditional methods of cost-
21:942:55087:14:13:89:499:446:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit criteria when making coverage decisions at 
21:943:55175:13:14:89:504:433:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:private and public health plans14. CE analysis has been the major method proposed to 
21:944:55260:14:14:89:497:419:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:evaluate new medical inventions and has been argued to be central in managing new 
21:945:55342:14:14:89:507:405:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:technologies, their adoption, and their impact on health care spending.  Such valuation 
21:946:55430:14:14:89:515:391:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:schemes are often linear valuation methods, which contrasts with our claim that there is 
21:947:55519:14:14:89:334:377:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:an important non-linearity in the valuation of life.  
21:948:55573:14:13:89:92:363:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
21:949:55573:13:14:89:504:350:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Also, much more analysis is needed on the optimal life-cycle behavior with respect to 
21:950:55659:14:14:89:510:336:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:insuring terminal care as it occur ex-post and how it is insured ex-ante. The fact that so 
21:951:55750:14:14:89:490:322:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:many bankruptcies occurs surrounding life-threatening disease indicates that many 
21:952:55832:14:13:89:522:308:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:people are willing to spend down their wealth. However, if more fully insured this wealth 
21:953:55922:13:14:89:508:295:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:may have been better enjoyed in a healthy state prior to the sickness. The commitment 
21:954:56008:14:14:89:493:281:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:devices that currently exist, such as e.g. advance directives, needs to be analyzed in 
21:955:56095:14:14:89:524:267:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:conjunction with such insurance.  The unexpected nature of life-threatening disease needs 
21:956:56185:14:14:89:317:253:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:to be better incorporated into future analysis.    
21:957:56236:14:13:89:92:239:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
21:958:56236:13:14:89:507:226:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:In addition, for purposes of insurance coverage, it is important to learn more about the 
21:959:56325:14:14:89:503:212:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of demand for terminal care in as much as it induces optimal benefit design. 
21:960:56413:14:14:89:509:198:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:The basic argument is that there is a tradeoff between risk-sharing (which favors no co-
21:961:56501:14:14:89:477:184:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:pays) and appropriate incentives (which favors cost-based co pays) in providing 
21:962:56581:14:13:89:522:170:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:insurance that effects medical care use (Mark V, Pauly 1968; Richard Zeckhauser 1970;). 
21:963:56669:13:14:89:521:157:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:This logic implies that if the estimates suggesting an inelastic demand for specialty drugs 
21:964:56761:14:23:89:503:143:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:or biologics generalize to other forms of terminal care, terminal care should be highly 
21:965:56849:23:7:234:237:120:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:?:                                                 
21:966:56897:7:16:90:505:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:14 The literature is vast, but for examples, see Weinstein and Stason (1977), Johanneson  and Weinstein 
21:967:57001:16:12:89:513:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(1993), Gold et al. (1996), Drummond et al. (1997), Garber and Phelps (1997), Garber (2000), and Cutler

22:970:57113:0:13:90:511:708:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:insured. The common argument that insured terminal care is wasted on people going to 
22:971:57198:13:14:90:514:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:their grave may ignore that the demand for this type of care is very inelastic and, hence, 
22:972:57289:14:14:89:189:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:should be insured.

22:974:57311:14:14:89:500:653:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:To conclude, the general argument we make is that existing theoretical and empirical 
22:975:57396:14:13:89:519:639:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:analysis of the value of life do not apply, and often understates the value of terminal care 
22:976:57489:13:14:90:475:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:and life near its end. The different incentives that are present when fighting life-
22:977:57573:14:14:90:486:612:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:threatening diseases are not well-understood, and deserve much more attention by 
22:978:57654:14:14:90:518:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:economists. This is particularly pressing given the large shares of GDPs across countries 
22:979:57744:14:14:90:242:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:that are used up in this fight.

23:987:58017:13:14:90:514:626:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:To estimate the option value of AZT, one would ideally want survival curves that cover 
23:988:58104:14:14:90:503:612:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the entire life spans of AIDS patients under the various combinations of antiretroviral 
23:989:58192:14:14:90:506:598:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:therapies needed to estimate the survival curves described above.   However, there are 
23:990:58278:14:14:90:518:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:several obstacles.  First, most clinical trials and observational data do not follow patients 
23:991:58372:14:13:90:511:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:for more than 2, and only sometimes 5, years so it is necessary to extrapolate long term 
23:992:58461:13:14:90:501:557:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:survival probabilities.  Moreover, since AZT was available in 1988 and HAART was 
23:993:58542:14:14:90:514:543:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:available in 1997, to varying extents, some of the curves of interest are counter-factual.  
23:994:58634:14:15:90:499:529:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:For example, it is difficult to estimate S1997 , the survival of patients who received no

23:996:58811:14:14:90:521:500:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of AIDS patients, because there are very few patients who received no treatment for their 
23:997:58901:14:14:90:482:486:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:disease, followed by HAART.  Therefore, it is necessary to find some way to use 
23:998:58981:14:13:90:509:472:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:observed AIDS survival data to construct survival curves under the each of the therapy 
23:999:59068:13:14:90:221:459:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:scenarios outlined above.   
23:1000:59096:14:14:90:93:445:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
23:1001:59096:14:14:90:480:431:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:As a starting point, our analysis begins with the AIDS survival curves by year of 
23:1002:59178:14:14:90:528:417:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:infection estimated by Philipson and Jena (2006)15 for each year between 1979 and 2000.   
23:1003:59268:14:13:89:518:403:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:We then combine these curves to obtain the survival curves of interest as follows.  Since 
23:1004:59358:13:14:89:506:390:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:AZT was introduced in 1988 and the data from Philipson and Jena (2006) suggest that 
23:1005:59442:14:14:89:516:376:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:less than 15% of AIDS patients diagnosed in 1979 survived at least 9 years, we used the 
23:1006:59530:14:14:89:511:362:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:survival of 1979 AIDS patients to estimate S, the survival curve for AIDS patients who 
23:1007:59617:14:14:89:521:348:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:received no therapy.  Since HAART was introduced in 1997, we used the survival curves 
23:1008:59703:14:14:89:490:334:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:for patient diagnosed in 1997 to estimate , the survival of patients who received 
23:1009:59785:14:0:89:291:320:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:HAART from the onset of their disease.

23:1012:59828:13:14:90:502:293:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:To estimate S’, the survival for patients who received AZT only, we used the medical 
23:1013:59913:14:14:90:521:279:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:literature on the randomized clinical trials effects of AZT (Swanson et al., 1989; Lemp et 
23:1014:60004:14:14:90:507:265:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:al., 1990; Moore et al., 1991; Vella et al., 1992;  Lundgren et al., 1994).  These studies 
23:1015:60095:14:14:90:521:251:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:primarily examined the effect of AZT on the probability that AIDS patients survived to 2 
23:1016:60184:14:13:90:501:237:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:years following their disease.  Across these studies, AZT increased the probability of 
23:1017:60271:13:14:90:509:224:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:surviving to one year by 180% and the probability of surviving to two years by 275%.  
23:1018:60357:14:14:90:516:210:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:We therefore assumed that AZT increased the probability of surviving one year and two 
23:1019:60443:14:14:89:508:196:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:years by 180% and 275% respectively, compared to no treatment, but we assumed that 
23:1020:60526:14:14:89:514:182:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:AZT had no effect on survival to three years and beyond.  We made this assumption for 
23:1021:60612:14:13:89:521:168:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:two reasons.  First is that it provides an extremely conservative lower bound on the effect 
23:1022:60704:13:26:89:514:155:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:of AZT.  Second, this assumption is in line with the literature, as Lundgren et al. (1994) 
23:1023:60795:26:8:234:237:129:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:?:                                                 
23:1024:60843:8:19:90:500:121:64:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:15 We adopt these estimated survival curves because they avoid problems intrinsic to 
23:1025:60928:19:14:89:484:102:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:extrapolating parametric models such as exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz. (See 
23:1026:61008:14:14:89:287:88:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix of Philipson and Jena (2006))

24:1029:61140:13:14:90:505:695:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:patient receiving AZT actually experienced lower survival probabilities in subsequent 
24:1030:61226:14:14:90:490:681:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:years, so that the probability of surviving to five years was similar for both groups.

24:1034:61494:18:14:90:499:611:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:post disease, conditional on having survived  j-1 years.  As previously discussed, the 
24:1035:61581:14:13:90:511:597:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:diagnosis of AIDS carried a particularly grim prognosis, as the probability of surviving 
24:1036:61670:13:14:90:487:584:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the first year for patients receiving no treatment is 47%.  AZT increases the yearly 
24:1037:61755:14:14:90:510:570:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:probability of surviving in the first and second years to 84% and 93% respectively.  As 
24:1038:61843:14:14:90:513:556:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:stated earlier, we assumed that AZT only impacted overall survival probabilities for the 
24:1039:61932:14:14:90:501:542:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:first two years.  Not surprisingly then, the conditional probability for surviving to the 
24:1040:62022:14:13:90:510:528:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:third year is lower for AZT patients relative to patients who received no treatment, and 
24:1041:62111:13:14:90:480:515:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the conditional probabilities are the same for both groups in each year thereafter. 
24:1042:62195:14:14:90:93:501:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B: 
24:1043:62195:14:14:90:523:487:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:The introduction of HAART dramatically increased survival, as 90% of HAART patients 
24:1044:62279:14:14:90:523:473:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:survived their first year with the disease. Table A1 shows that HAART is clearly superior 
24:1045:62369:14:13:90:512:459:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:to receiving no treatment, as the one year survival probabilities with HAART dominate 
24:1046:62455:13:14:90:523:446:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:the survival probabilities with no treatment at all years shown.  It is useful to note that the 
24:1047:62551:14:14:90:520:432:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:one year probabilities with no treatment at years three onwards (ranging from 81%-97%) 
24:1048:62638:14:14:89:500:418:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:are close to the HAART probabilities (95-97%), again based on the clinical literature 
24:1049:62724:14:13:89:511:404:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:reporting clinical trial effects.  However, as discussed in equation (10), overall survival 
24:1050:62816:13:14:89:495:391:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:probabilities represent the product of the one year probabilities shown in Table A1.  
24:1051:62902:14:14:90:503:377:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, while patients receiving no treatment have similar survival probabilities in 
24:1052:62990:14:14:90:520:363:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:year 3 and onwards compared to patients receiving HAART, their low survival prospects 
24:1053:63076:14:14:90:516:349:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:overall are driven by the extremely unfavorable probabilities of surviving in years 1 and 
24:1054:63166:14:13:90:502:335:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:2.  Similarly, the year 1 and 2 conditional survival probabilities under AZT (84% and 
24:1055:63252:13:14:90:507:322:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:93% respectively) are similar to year 1 and 2 probabilities under  HAART equivalents 
24:1056:63337:14:14:90:517:308:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:(90% and 95%) .  The year 3 probability for AZT patients is 32% however, compared to 
24:1057:63422:14:14:90:522:294:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:95% for HAART, so that overall survival probabilities for AZT patients will be markedly 
24:1058:63510:14:14:90:324:280:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:B:lower than for HAART patients after this time.
