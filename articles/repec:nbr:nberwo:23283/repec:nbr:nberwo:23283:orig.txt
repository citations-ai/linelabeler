2:32:1659:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:We analyze the effect of technological change in a novel framework that integrates an economy's 
2:33:1755:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:skill distribution  with  its  occupational  and  industrial  structure.  Individuals  become  managers  or 
2:34:1862:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:workers based on their managerial vs. worker skills, and workers further sort into a continuum of 
2:35:1959:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:tasks (occupations) ranked by skill content. Our theory dictates that faster technological progress 
2:36:2058:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:for  middle-skill  tasks not  only  raises  the  employment  shares  and  relative  wages  of  lower-  and 
2:37:2164:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:higher-skill  occupations  among workers  (horizontal  polarization),  but  also  raises  those  of 
2:38:2263:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:managers  over  workers  as  a  whole  (vertical polarization).  Both  dimensions  of  polarization  are 
2:39:2367:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:faster  within  sectors  that  depend  more  on  middle-skill tasks  and  less  on  managers.  This 
2:40:2466:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:endogenously  leads  to  faster  TFP  growth  of  such  sectors,  whose  employment and  value-added 
2:41:2566:14:14:71:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:shares shrink if sectoral goods are complementary (structural change). We present several novel 
2:42:2661:14:14:71:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f2:facts  that  support  our  model,  followed  by  a  quantitative  analysis  showing  that  task-specific 
2:43:2765:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:technological  progress--which  was  fastest  for  occupations  embodying  routine-manual  tasks  but 
2:44:2867:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:not interpersonal skills--is important for understanding changes in the sectoral, occupational, and 
2:45:2966:14:42:72:345:392:12:Times:12:Times:organizational structure of the U.S. economy since 1980.

3:59:3261:0:29:101:237:708:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:1    Introduction
3:60:3278:29:18:101:510:679:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We develop a novel framework that integrates an economy’s distribution of individual
3:61:3362:18:18:101:510:661:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skills  with  its  occupational  and  industrial  structure.   It  enables  an  analysis  of  how
3:62:3459:18:18:101:510:643:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:changes in wage and employment shares across occupations and industrial sectors are
3:63:3542:18:18:101:510:625:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:interrelated,  providing  a  comprehensive  view  on  the  economic  forces  that  shape  the
3:64:3635:18:18:101:421:607:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupational, sectoral, and organizational structure of an economy.
3:65:3702:18:18:117:510:589:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In our model, individuals are heterogeneous in two dimensions of skill—managerial
3:66:3783:18:18:101:510:571:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:talent and worker human capital—based on which they become a manager or a worker.
3:67:3864:18:18:101:510:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Workers then select into a continuum of tasks (or occupations) based on their human
3:68:3947:18:18:101:510:535:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:capital.1Managers organize the workers’ tasks, in addition to their own, to produce
3:69:4030:18:18:101:510:517:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sector-specific goods.  Sectors differ in how intensively different tasks are used in pro-
3:70:4120:18:17:101:510:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:duction.  Individual skills are sector-neutral, so they only care about their occupation
3:71:4208:17:18:101:350:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and are indifferent about which sector they work in.
3:72:4260:18:18:117:510:464:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  characterize  the  equilibrium  assignment  of  occupations  and  sectors  theoreti-
3:73:4348:18:18:101:510:446:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cally, and prove a series of comparative statics in response to task-specific technolog-
3:74:4436:18:18:101:510:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ical progress that is sector- and factor-neutral.  If different tasks are complementary
3:75:4523:18:18:101:510:410:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in production, faster technological progress among middle-skill tasks—more precisely,
3:76:4608:18:18:101:510:392:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:those  tasks  chosen  by  middle-skill  workers  in  equilibrium—leads  to:  (i)  higher  em-
3:77:4701:18:18:101:510:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ployment shares and wages for low- and high-skill occupations relative to middle-skill
3:78:4787:18:18:101:510:356:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupations—i.e. job and wage polarization among workers—in all sectors; (ii) a higher
3:79:4873:18:18:101:510:338:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:employment share and wage for managers relative to workers as a whole—which we dub
3:80:4955:18:18:101:510:320:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:verticalpolarization to distinguish from thehorizontalpolarization across workers—in
3:81:5039:18:18:101:510:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all sectors; (iii) faster horizontal and vertical polarization within sectors that depend
3:82:5128:18:18:101:510:284:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more  on  middle-skill  tasks  and  less  on  managers;  and  (iv)  faster  endogenous  total
3:83:5221:18:18:101:510:266:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:factor  productivity  (TFP)  growth  of  such  sectors,  shrinking  their  employment  and
3:84:5311:18:18:101:485:248:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value-added shares if sectoral goods are complementary (i.e., structural change).
3:85:5392:18:17:117:510:230:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  last  result  merits  further  discussion.   First,  because  sector-level  TFP  in  our
3:86:5485:17:18:101:510:213:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:model  is  endogenously  determined  by  equilibrium  occupational  choices,  task-specific
3:87:5576:18:18:101:510:195:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:technological progress—which is sector neutral—has differential impact across sectors,
3:88:5662:18:18:101:510:177:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:causing structural change.  Second, as the employment share of sectors that rely less on
3:89:5750:18:18:101:510:159:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:middle-skill workers and more on managers rises, the overall degree of horizontal and
3:90:5835:18:18:101:510:141:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:vertical polarization is reinforced.  Third, if all structural change is driven by sector-
3:91:5925:18:18:101:510:123:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:neutral task-specific technological progress, those occupations with faster technological
3:92:6014:18:18:101:510:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:progress  may  vanish  asymptotically,  but  all  sectors  coexist:   Once  the  employment
3:93:6105:18:15:88:540:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:1Technically, a task is the technology used by a certain occupation.  Nonetheless, we will use “task” and
3:94:6210:15:0:72:301:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:“occupation” interchangeably throughout the paper.
4:95:6261:0:18:101:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:shares  of  the  occupations  with  faster  progress  become  negligible,  structural  change
4:96:6354:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ceases.  This is in contrast to theories of structural change that rely on sector-specific
4:97:6444:18:18:101:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:forces,  in which the shift of production factors from one sector to another continues
4:98:6530:18:18:101:267:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:until the shrinking sector vanishes.
4:99:6566:18:18:117:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Predictions (i) through (iv) are salient features of the U.S. economy since 1980:  (i)
4:100:6652:18:18:101:510:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:job and wage polarization is well-documented in the literature, e.g., Autor and Dorn
4:101:6736:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2013), which we refer to as horizontal polarization; (ii) using the same data, we newly
4:102:6824:18:18:101:510:582:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:document vertical polarization; and (iii) we empirically establish that manufacturing
4:103:6909:18:18:101:510:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is more reliant on middle-skill workers and less on managers than services,  and also
4:104:6994:18:18:101:510:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that, while both sectors polarized, the two dimensions of polarization are indeed faster
4:105:7082:18:18:101:510:528:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:within  manufacturing  than  in  services.2Finally,  (iv)  it  is  well  understood  that  the
4:106:7176:18:18:101:510:510:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:faster growth of manufacturing TFP—which we show accelerated around 1980 in the
4:107:7255:18:18:101:492:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data—is an important driver of structural change from manufacturing to services.
4:108:7335:18:18:117:510:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our model shows that one common cause is driving all of the above empirical facts:
4:109:7417:18:17:101:510:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:faster technological progress for middle-skill tasks (which are more intensively used in
4:110:7505:17:18:101:177:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing).
4:111:7520:18:18:117:510:421:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The theoretical model has one managerial task and a continuum of worker tasks.
4:112:7598:18:18:101:510:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To  quantify  the  model,  we  discretize  the  latter  into  10  occupation  categories.   Our
4:113:7693:18:18:101:510:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:analysis  confirms  that  task-specific  technological  progress  alone—without  sector-  or
4:114:7785:18:18:101:510:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:factor-specific technological progress—can almost fully account for the changes in the
4:115:7871:18:18:101:502:349:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sectoral, occupational, and organizational structure in the U.S. economy since 1980.
4:116:7955:18:18:117:510:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The next natural question to ask is what can explain such differential productivity
4:117:8038:18:18:101:510:313:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:improvements  across  tasks.   Autor  and  Dorn  (2013),  Goos,  Manning,  and  Salomons
4:118:8126:18:18:101:510:295:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2014) and others have hypothesized that “routinization,” or faster technological ad-
4:119:8211:18:18:101:510:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:vancement  for  tasks  that  are  more  routine  in  nature  (which  tend  to  be  middle-skill
4:120:8306:18:18:101:510:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupations in the data), led to (horizontal) polarization.  They test this empirically
4:121:8393:18:18:101:510:241:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by constructing a routine-task intensity (RTI) index for each occupation from the Dic-
4:122:8479:18:18:101:401:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tionary of Occupation Titles (DOT) and its successor O*NET.
4:123:8538:18:18:117:510:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We follow a similar route, but use more disaggregated indices than RTI that con-
4:124:8618:18:17:101:510:187:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sider detailed characteristics of occupations.  We find that the task-specific technologi-
4:125:8708:17:18:101:510:170:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cal progress we quantify from the changes in the occupational structure is much more

4:127:8875:18:23:101:510:134:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:inverse of the manual-interpersonal index than with RTI. In other words, technological
4:128:8961:23:16:88:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:2In addition, we provide evidence from establishment-level data that corroborates faster vertical polar-
4:129:9065:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:ization in manufacturing:  Manufacturing establishments on average shrank faster in terms of employment
4:130:9168:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and grew faster in terms of value-added than those in services, which is predicted by our model, if we assume
4:131:9277:11:0:72:375:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:that the number of managers per establishment was stable over time.
5:132:9345:0:18:101:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:progress since 1980 is primarily embodied in those manual tasks that are repetitive in
5:133:9431:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:nature and require few interpersonal skills.  This strongly suggests that the relatively
5:134:9519:18:18:101:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:easier automation of such tasks explains their faster productivity growth, which is con-
5:135:9607:18:18:101:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sistent with the routinization hypothesis.  On the other hand, the fact that polarization
5:136:9696:18:18:101:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is observed even within the service sector suggests that trade may not have been the
5:137:9780:18:33:101:159:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:main driver.
5:138:9792:33:18:101:510:585:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:Related LiteratureThe model we consider is of particular relevance for the U.S.
5:139:9871:18:18:101:510:567:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and other advanced economies.  The 1980s marks a starting point of rising labor mar-
5:140:9955:18:18:101:510:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ket inequality, of which polarization is a salient feature.  It coincided with the rise of
5:141:10045:18:18:101:510:531:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:low-skill service jobs (Autor and Dorn, 2013) and also a clear rise in manufacturing
5:142:10129:18:18:101:510:513:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:productivity.  The latter was implicitly noted in Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi
5:143:10215:18:18:101:510:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2014) and is further corroborated in our empirical analysis.  Our main finding in this
5:144:10302:18:18:101:510:477:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:regard is that task-specific technological progress is of first-order importance for under-

5:149:10677:18:18:101:510:387:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our model is similar to theirs (except that we include capital), but we gain new insights
5:150:10766:18:17:101:510:369:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by incorporating two dimensional skills (managerial talent and worker human capital)
5:151:10850:17:18:101:200:352:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and multiple sectors.
5:152:10871:18:18:117:510:334:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The only other paper we know of with a structure in which individuals with different
5:153:10955:18:18:101:510:316:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skills  sort  into  occupations,  which  are  then  used  as  production  inputs  in  multiple

5:155:11145:18:18:101:510:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a version of Costinot and Vogel (2010),  in which skills are continuous but tasks are
5:156:11230:18:18:101:510:262:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:discrete.   The  latter assumption  enables  an  analytic characterization of  the  effect  of
5:157:11324:18:18:101:510:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:task-specific technological change, which is in turn used for demonstrating the broad
5:158:11409:18:18:101:389:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:range of phenomena that can be explained by such a model.
5:159:11466:18:18:117:510:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We take the same approach in our quantitative section (i.e., tasks are discretized),
5:160:11550:18:18:101:510:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and use the U.S. data to quantify how relevant our model is for the employment and
5:161:11632:18:18:101:510:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relative wage trends across occupations and sectors between 1980 and 2010.  In par-
5:162:11715:18:18:101:510:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ticular, we emphasize the differential pace of polarization across sectors and explicitly
5:163:11804:18:18:101:510:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relate polarization to structural change.  In addition,  since we treat managers as an
5:164:11890:18:18:101:510:118:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupation that is qualitatively different from workers, the model has implications for
5:165:11977:18:17:101:510:100:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:how production is organized in different sectors.  We document several important new
5:166:12061:17:0:101:432:83:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:facts along these dimensions that validate our modeling assumptions.
6:167:12130:0:18:117:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The manager-level technology in our model extends the span-of-control model of
6:168:12208:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lucas  (1978),  in  which  managers  hire  workers  for  production.   Unlike  all  existing
6:169:12300:18:18:101:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:variants of the span-of-control model, our managers organize tasks instead of workers.
6:170:12386:18:18:101:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:That is, instead of deciding how many workers to hire, they decide on the quantities
6:171:12470:18:18:101:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of each task to use in production, and for each task, how much skill to hire.  Moreover,
6:172:12558:18:18:101:510:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we assume a constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) technology between managerial

6:174:12659:18:18:117:510:582:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Goos et al. (2014) empirically finds that relative price changes in task-specific capi-
6:175:12746:18:18:101:510:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tal have driven employment polarization in Europe.  It decomposes employment polar-
6:176:12829:18:18:101:510:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ization into within- and between-industry components, but abstracts from changes in
6:177:12912:18:18:101:510:528:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equilibrium wages and aggregate quantities.  Our analysis shows that general equilib-
6:178:12997:18:18:101:510:510:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rium considerations have important implications for the estimation of the elasticity of
6:179:13084:18:18:101:510:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:substitution across tasks, a key parameter in such analyses.  D ̈urnecker and Herrendorf
6:180:13172:18:18:101:510:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2017) also considers occupations and industries, and show that structural change from
6:181:13258:18:17:101:510:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing to services can be represented by shifts at the occupation level in many
6:182:13344:17:18:101:510:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:countries.  Its conclusion is based on classifying occupations in the data as (mutually-
6:183:13432:18:18:101:510:421:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:exclusive) manufacturing or service jobs.  In contrast, we keep occupations and sectors
6:184:13519:18:18:101:510:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:conceptually separate, and analyze the effect of task-specific and sector-specific tech-
6:185:13607:18:18:101:459:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:nologies for employment and wage inequalities across the skill distribution.
6:186:13683:18:18:117:510:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:There  is  a  growing  literature  in  international  trade  that  uses  assignment  models
6:187:13774:18:18:101:510:349:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to explain inequality between occupations and/or industries (Burstein, Morales, and
6:188:13857:18:18:101:510:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Vogel,  2015;  Lee,  2015).   The  majority  of  such  models  follow  the  tradition  of  Roy:
6:189:13952:18:18:101:510:313:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Workers have as many dimensions of skills as there are available industry-occupation
6:190:14036:18:18:101:510:295:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:combinations,  and  select  themselves  into  the  job  in  which  they  have  a  comparative
6:191:14129:18:18:101:510:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:advantage.  To make the model tractable, a Fr ́echet distribution is utilized to collapse it
6:192:14221:18:18:101:510:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:into an empirically testable set of equations for each industry and/or occupation pair.
6:193:14308:18:18:101:510:241:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  manager-worker  division  in  our  model  is  also  due  to  Roy-selection  (managerial
6:194:14400:18:18:101:510:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:talent vs.  worker human capital), but workers sort into a continuum of tasks based on
6:195:14486:18:18:101:510:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:one-dimensional skill.  Having only two skill dimensions facilitates mapping them to
6:196:14570:18:17:101:510:187:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:individual characteristics observable in the data, so we can explore occupation choices
6:197:14657:17:18:101:510:170:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and (as an extension) skill formation using standard labor and macroeconomic models
6:198:14740:18:18:101:185:152:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of human capital.
6:199:14757:18:23:117:510:134:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Structural change in our model occurs because sectoral productivities evolve differ-
6:200:14841:23:16:88:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:3While Lucas’s original model is based on a generic homogeneous-of-degree-one technology, virtually all
6:201:14944:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:papers that followed assume a Cobb-Douglas technology.  We incorporate (i) non-unitary elasticity between
6:202:15049:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:managers and workers, (ii) heterogeneity in worker productivity as well as in managerial productivity, (iii)
6:203:15157:11:0:72:356:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:multiple worker tasks (or occupations), and (iv) multiple sectors.
7:204:15224:0:18:101:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:entially over time, as in Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and most other production-driven
7:205:15309:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:models of structural change.  What we add to this literature is a mechanism for sectoral
7:206:15397:18:18:101:511:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:productivities  to  evolveendogenously:  the  changing  equilibrium  occupational  choice
7:207:15486:18:18:101:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:due  to  task-specific  technological  progress.   Also  related  is  Acemoglu  and  Guerrieri
7:208:15580:18:18:101:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2008), in which the capital-intensive sector vanishes in the limiting balanced growth
7:209:15666:18:18:101:510:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:path.  In comparison, sectors in our model differ in how intensively they use different
7:210:15753:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tasks.  By contrasting different types of labor, rather than capital and labor, we can
7:211:15839:18:18:101:510:582:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:connect structural change across sectors to labor market inequality across occupations
7:212:15925:18:18:101:510:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and skills.  Moreover, unlike these papers, ours implies that it is certain occupations
7:213:16012:18:18:101:410:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rather than broadly-defined sectors that may vanish in the limit.
7:214:16077:18:18:117:510:528:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Finally, we note that some recent papers consider the relationship between skill and
7:215:16161:18:18:101:510:510:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:structural change. Buera and Kaboski (2012) and Buera, Kaboski, and Rogerson (2015)
7:216:16244:18:18:101:510:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:feature multiple worker types as different inputs of production.  Similarly, B ́ar ́any and
7:217:16335:18:18:101:510:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Siegel  (2017)  argues  that  polarization  may  be  explained  by  structural  change,  in  a
7:218:16429:18:17:101:510:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:model where skills are occupation-specific and occupations are sector-specific.  In these
7:219:16518:17:18:101:510:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:models,  task-specific  technology  is  ruled  out,  so  all  change  must  be  either  skill-  or
7:220:16616:18:18:101:510:421:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sector-specific.  The addition of the task dimension in our model separates skills from
7:221:16703:18:18:101:510:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the occupation in which they are used, thereby permitting technological changes specific
7:222:16791:18:18:101:510:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to a task and also an analysis of their impact on the selection of skills into occupations.
7:223:16882:18:18:101:510:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It also allows us to exploit data on occupational employment and wageswithinsectors
7:224:16965:18:18:101:510:349:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as  well  as  across  sectors.4Equally  important,  the  sectoral  TFPs  in  our  model  are
7:225:17057:18:18:101:398:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:endogenously determined by equilibrium occupational choices.
7:226:17117:18:18:117:510:313:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we summarize the most
7:227:17200:18:18:101:510:295:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relevant empirical facts:  horizontal and vertical polarization in the overall economy,
7:228:17287:18:18:101:510:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the faster speed of polarization within manufacturing than in services, and structural
7:229:17373:18:18:101:510:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:change.  In Section 3, we present the model and solve for its equilibrium.  In Section 4,
7:230:17462:18:18:101:510:241:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we perform comparative statics showing that faster technological progress for middle-
7:231:17547:18:18:101:510:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skill tasks leads to horizontal and vertical polarization, and to structural change.  In
7:232:17635:18:18:101:510:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Section  5  we  calibrate  a  discrete-occupation  version  of  the  model,  and  in  Section  6
7:233:17731:18:17:101:510:187:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:quantify the importance of task-specific technological progress and map it to empirical
7:234:17818:17:18:101:510:170:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:measures of task characteristics.  Section 7 concludes, outlining the broader applicabil-

8:251:18830:28:18:101:510:404:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this section we summarize known facts on structural change and polarization, and
8:252:18913:18:18:101:510:386:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:present novel evidence on how the two may be related.  We also provide a new way of
8:253:18996:18:18:101:510:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:looking at managerial occupations by considering them as qualtitatively different from
8:254:19082:18:33:101:373:350:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all other occupations, and relate them to establishments.

8:256:19215:18:18:101:510:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:share trends of three broadly defined sectors:  agriculture, manufacturing and services,
8:257:19303:18:18:101:510:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from  1970  to  2013.   Following  convention,  e.g.   Herrendorf  et  al.  (2014),  “manufac-
8:258:19397:18:18:101:510:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:turing” is the aggregation of the manufacturing, mining and construction sectors and
8:259:19481:18:18:101:510:245:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:“services” the sum of all service and government sectors.  The data are from the Na-
8:260:19565:18:18:101:510:227:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tional Accounts published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In particular,
8:261:19647:18:18:101:510:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:employment is based on National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Table 6 (per-
8:262:19727:18:18:101:478:191:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:sons involved in production), counted in terms of full-time equivalent workers.5
8:263:19807:18:18:117:510:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Two facts are well documented in the literature.  First, starting from even before
8:264:19889:18:18:101:510:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1970,  agriculture  was  a  negligible  share  of  the  U.S.  economy.   For  the  remainder  of
8:265:19985:18:18:101:510:137:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this  paper,  we  will  drop  the  agricultural  sector,  and  all  moments  will  be  computed
8:266:20080:18:17:101:510:119:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as  if  the  aggregate  economy  consisted  only  of  manufacturing  and  services  (e.g.   the
8:267:20175:17:27:101:339:102:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing and service shares sum up to one).
8:268:20223:27:0:88:498:75:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:5Computing employment shares from the decennial census yields more or less the same trend.

9:272:20434:12:12:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Source:  BEA  NIPA  accounts.   Sectoral  output  and  capital  are  computed  via  cyclical  expansion  from  the
9:273:20548:12:12:72:540:518:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:industry accounts as in Herrendorf et al. (2013).  Employment is based on full-time equivalent number of
9:274:20652:12:12:72:540:506:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:persons in production in NIPA Table 6.  Within each sector, TFP is measured as the Solow residual given a
9:275:20757:12:34:72:393:494:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:capital income share of 0.361, and log-TFP’s are normalized to 0 in 1947.
9:276:20830:34:18:117:510:460:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Second, structural change—the shifting of GDP and employment from manufactur-
9:277:20907:18:18:101:510:442:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ing to services—exhibits a smooth trend starting from at least the 1970s, as noted in
9:278:20992:18:18:101:510:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Herrendorf et al. (2014).  Moreover, either sector’s GDP share and employment share
9:279:21075:18:17:101:510:406:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are almost identical both in terms of levels and trends.  This implies a nearly constant
9:280:21163:17:18:101:510:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:input share of labor across the two sectors,  which we will assume in our theoretical
9:281:21248:18:18:101:510:371:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:model. Herrendorf et al. (2014) also notes that manufacturing’s relative TFP has grown
9:282:21334:18:18:101:510:353:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:quicker than services post 1970s, but that such trends may not be stable over a longer
9:283:21420:18:18:101:139:335:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:horizon.
9:284:21428:18:18:117:510:317:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Figure 2, we show TFP growth in manufacturing and services from 1948 assuming
9:285:21508:18:18:101:511:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a capital income share of 0.361.6Note that manufacturing’s TFP relative to services
9:286:21591:18:18:101:510:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:was more or less constant prior to the early 1980s, after which it exhibits a widening
9:287:21677:18:18:101:510:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gap.  In our quantitative model, we will relate this to faster task-specific technological
9:288:21767:18:18:101:510:245:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:progress among middle-skill jobs,  so the timing of this rise is important:  According
9:289:21853:18:18:101:510:227:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to Autor and Dorn (2013), this is also the period in which such jobs began to show a
9:290:21937:18:33:101:215:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:distinct declining trend.
9:291:21962:33:18:101:510:176:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:Job and wage polarizationMost of the rest of our empirical analysis is based
9:292:22038:18:18:101:510:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on  the  decennial  U.S.  Censuses  1980–2010,  for  which  we  closely  follow  Autor  and
9:293:22129:18:29:101:510:140:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Dorn (2013).  We restrict our sample to 16–65 year-old non-farm employment.  Figure
9:294:22212:29:16:88:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:6This  is  the  longest  time  period  allowed  by  the  industry  accounts,  which  we  need  to  compute  real
9:295:22324:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:GDP  and  capital  at  the  sector  level.   Herrendorf,  Herrington,  and  Valentinyi  (2015)  argues  that  Cobb-
9:296:22439:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Douglas sectoral production functions with equal capital income shares can quantitatively capture the effect
9:297:22547:11:0:72:366:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of differentially evolving sectoral TFP’s.  See Section 5.2 for details.

10:335:24072:18:17:117:510:288:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The data is presented in two ways.  First, following Autor and Dorn (2013), each
10:336:24152:17:18:101:510:271:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:dot in Figure 3 represents one percent of employment in 1980.  They-axis in Panel (a)
10:337:24237:18:18:101:510:253:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:measures each skill percentile’s employment change from 1980 to 2010 in percentage
10:338:24319:18:18:101:510:235:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:points,  and  in  Panel  (b)  the  change  in  its  mean  wage.   The  changes  are  smoothed
10:339:24412:18:18:101:510:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:into  percentiles  across  neighboring  occupations  using  a  locally  weighted  smoothing
10:340:24503:18:18:101:510:199:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:regression.  Despite the Great Recession happening between 2005 and 2010, the long-
10:341:24586:18:18:101:510:181:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:run patterns are virtually the same as in their study:  employment has shifted from the
10:342:24673:18:18:101:510:163:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:middle toward both lower and higher skill jobs.  Likewise, wages have risen the least in
10:343:24761:18:18:101:310:145:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the middle, and much more toward the top.
10:344:24802:18:18:117:510:127:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Second, we group all occupations into 11 broad categories, vaguely corresponding

11:382:26532:18:18:101:510:297:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:structural change are interrelated.  In Figure 4, we plot the same data but along two
11:383:26617:18:18:101:510:279:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:different dimensions.  In Panel (a), occupations are ordered along thex-axis in the same
11:384:26705:18:18:101:510:261:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:way as we did in Figure 3.  For each occupation, we compute the employment share
11:385:26785:18:18:101:510:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of manufacturing in 1980 and 2010, and plot the difference.10The bars measure the

11:392:27329:8:16:88:540:135:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:8By construction, the area of all bars must add up to 0.  The smoothed graph should also integrate to 0
11:393:27432:16:8:72:370:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in theory, but does not due to the locally weighted regression errors.
11:394:27502:8:16:88:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:9The exact numbers behind these graphs are summarized in Appendix A Table 5, which also form the

12:408:28404:34:18:101:460:444:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:manufacturing shrank the most in the middle (again, except technicians).11
12:409:28478:18:17:117:510:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Panel (b) we plot the same changes as in Figure 3(a), but separate manufacturing

12:411:28652:18:18:101:510:391:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(except managers), which is structural change.  Note that this is mostly pronounced
12:412:28735:18:18:101:510:373:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the middle, especially among machine operators and miners.  In contrast, services
12:413:28819:18:18:101:510:355:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gained employment in all jobs, but mostly among extreme occupation-skill percentiles,
12:414:28904:18:18:101:362:337:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:particularly among low-skill services and professionals.
12:415:28960:18:18:117:510:319:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:What is important is that polarization is observed within both sectors, suggesting
12:416:29042:18:18:101:510:301:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the importance of task-specific forces that affect both: With sector-specific forces alone,
12:417:29133:18:18:101:510:283:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we  would  expect  employment  shifts  across  occupations  to  be  flatter  in  both  panels.
12:418:29227:18:33:101:510:265:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:More important, Panel (b) shows that manufacturing polarized by more than services.
12:419:29310:33:18:101:511:232:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:Vertical polarizationIn our model and quantitative analysis, we treat managers
12:420:29388:18:18:101:510:214:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as  a  special  occupation  that  organizes  all  other  occupations.   While  many  studies
12:421:29480:18:18:101:510:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:emphasize the organization of production (Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006), most
12:422:29562:18:31:101:510:178:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:focused on top CEO’s of publicly traded companies (Tervio, 2008; Gabaix and Landier,
12:423:29646:31:16:84:540:147:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:11Technicians  include  software  engineers  and  programmers,  paralegals,  and  health  technicians,  which
12:424:29755:16:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:grew rapidly during this time period along with the service sector.  Indeed, many of the smooth graphs are
12:425:29861:12:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:flatten due to occupations in this group.  However, they comprise a very small fraction of the U.S. economy
12:426:29968:12:8:72:205:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:throughout the sample period.
12:427:29997:8:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:12So the area of all bars for one sector represents structural change, while adding them across both sums to
12:428:30105:16:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:0.  Similarly the integrals of the smoothed graphs should sum to 0, subject to the locally weighted regression

13:431:30316:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:managers as a broader group including CEOs, middle managers, and the self-employed,
13:432:30399:18:18:101:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and also connect them to a notion of establishment.  Previous papers have shown top
13:433:30482:18:18:101:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:CEO wages rising astronomically compared to the median worker’s, and Figure 5(a)
13:434:30562:18:18:101:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:shows  that  even  with  our  broader  definition,  the  “manager  wage  premium”  over  all
13:435:30654:18:18:101:510:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other workers rose from 45 percent in 1980 to 90 percent in 2010.  At the same time,
13:436:30738:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the employment share of managers has also risen from 11 to 13.5 percent,  although
13:437:30820:18:18:101:510:582:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:there is a small drop from 2000 to 2010.13We refer to this phenomenon throughout the
13:438:30904:18:18:101:510:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:paper as “vertical polarization,” to distinguish from the horizontal polarization across
13:439:30992:18:18:101:219:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:workers discussed above.
13:440:31016:18:18:117:510:528:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:More  important  for  us,  vertical  polarization  was  faster  in  manufacturing:  Man-
13:441:31104:18:18:101:510:510:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agers’  employment  share  rose  mostly  in  manufacturing  but  barely  at  all  in  services;
13:442:31199:18:18:101:510:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Appendix Figure 22 shows that managers’ mean wages relative to workers’ also grew
13:443:31280:18:18:101:510:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:much more quickly within manufacturing than in services.  This again suggests task- or
13:444:31366:18:17:101:510:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupation-specific forces, since sector-specific forces would not create such differences
13:445:31456:17:18:101:176:439:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:across sectors.14
13:446:31473:18:18:117:510:421:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  now  present  a  model  which  explains  all  these  phenomena  by  a  single  force:

13:448:31648:18:18:101:510:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and 4).  We then proceed with a quantitative assessment and empirical investigation
13:449:31731:18:39:101:355:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of where this progress stems from (Sections 5 and 6).

13:461:32596:8:16:84:540:123:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:14In Appendix Figure 23(a), we instead plot the manufacturing employment share among managers and
13:462:32693:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:workers, which shows that structural change was much more prevalent among workers than managers.  This
13:463:32795:12:8:72:281:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:is further evidence against sector-specific forces.
13:464:32846:8:16:84:539:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:15In  our  application,  the  two  sectors  indexed  bymandsstand  for  “manufacturing”  and  “services,”
13:465:32951:16:0:72:450:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:respectively.  However, the analysis can be extended to any finite numberNof sectors.
14:466:33038:0:18:117:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We will refer to the managerial task as “taskz,” which is vertically differentiated
14:467:33121:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(in a hierarchical sense) from tasksj∈J, which are horizontally differentiated among
14:468:33205:18:18:101:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:workers.  Each worker task requires both physical and worker human capital, and their
14:469:33290:18:27:101:428:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:allocations are decided by the manager.  Specifically, we assume that

15:557:36002:25:18:101:510:326:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We start by solving a static planner’s problem.  In this model, the planner allocation
15:558:36088:18:18:101:510:308:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and the competitive equilibrium allocation coincide.19A planner allocates aggregate

15:560:36250:18:18:101:510:272:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:hi(j;z) as the amount of human capital the planner allocates to taskjin sectoriunder
15:561:36334:18:18:101:510:254:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a manager withz.  Also definelih(s,j) as the number of individuals with skills= (h,z)
15:562:36419:18:18:101:510:236:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that the planner assigns to taskj, andliz(s) the number of individuals with skillsthe
15:563:36504:18:18:101:510:218:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:planner  assigns  as  managers,  in  sectori.   Then  the  planner’s  problem  is  to  choose

15:565:36682:17:16:84:540:183:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:17The estimated-between the manufacturing and the service sectors (broadly defined) is close to 0, as
15:566:36783:16:8:71:171:167:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:we show in section 5.2.
15:567:36806:8:16:84:540:159:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:18Except  Costinot  and  Vogel  (2010),  most  task-based  models  assume  that  either  tasks  or  skills  are  a
15:568:36920:16:12:71:539:143:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:continuum, but not both (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Stokey, 2016).  The worker side of our model is similar
15:569:37026:12:12:71:539:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to  theirs,  but  includes  capital  as  a  production  factor  and  is  extended  to  multiple  sectors.   In  contrast  to
15:570:37150:12:12:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:all  existing  models,  we  add  two-dimensional  skills  and  consider  managers  as  a  special  occupation,  which
15:571:37267:12:8:71:361:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:generates additional insights both theoretically and quantitatively.
15:572:37335:8:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:19Nancy Stokey shared with us the insight that solving for the competitive equilibrium would be more
15:573:37435:16:12:71:539:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:intuitive than solving for the planner’s problem.  Although the two are equivalent, the equilibrium approach
15:574:37543:12:0:71:539:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:would simplify the proofs.  We are working out the details, to be included in the next iteration of the paper.

18:718:41102:0:18:101:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is, there is positive sorting of workers into tasks, and workers of skillhare assigned to

18:720:41261:18:18:117:510:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It  should  be  clear  thatˆj(h)  andˆh(j)  are  identical  across  sectors,  and  hence  not

18:722:41437:18:18:101:510:636:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increase output.  So the planner’s problem of choosinglih(s,j) has two parts:  One of
18:723:41522:18:18:101:511:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:choosinglh(s,j), the number of individuals with skillsassigned to taskjregardless of
18:724:41606:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:sector, and the other of choosingqih(j), the fraction of taskjworkers allocated to sector
18:725:41695:18:0:101:179:582:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:i, which satisfies

18:731:42029:18:18:101:510:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:come workers.  Since we know that workers sort positively intoj, we can also define
18:732:42112:18:18:101:510:477:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ˆz(j)  =   ̃z(ˆh(j)).   Then  the  planner’s  problem  is  to  get  this  implied  rule  ˆz(j)  for  all

18:750:42866:25:18:101:510:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:First consider the ruleliz(s).  Since the rule  ̃z(h) = ˆz(ˆj(h)) does not depend on sector,

21:891:47374:25:17:101:510:442:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A solution to the planner’s problem coincides with an equilibrium in our economy, so
21:892:47458:17:18:101:510:425:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium is equivalent to a unique solution to the
21:893:47542:18:18:101:510:407:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:planner’s problem.  As a final step, the planner needs to ensure that the within-sector
21:894:47629:18:18:101:510:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:allocations are consistent with the between-sector allocations. That is, the weights used

21:896:47804:18:18:101:501:353:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:These are equivalent to the the labor market clearing conditions for an equilibrium.

21:899:48047:18:18:101:510:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be equal across sectors, we can use the within-sector solutions from Proposition 1 to

21:901:48217:18:18:101:510:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sector solution is unique, but for the uniqueness of the full solution we need additional

23:982:51222:18:18:101:510:340:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ular, we are interested in the effect of routinization, which we model as an increase in
23:983:51310:18:18:101:510:322:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:M(j) for allj∈ J1≡[j,j], where 0< j<j < J; that is, as an increase in the TFP
23:984:51387:18:18:101:510:304:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of middle-skill tasks (or, more precisely, those tasks that are chosen by workers in the
23:985:51475:18:18:101:511:286:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:middle of thehdistribution).  We refer to this group of tasks as “routine jobs,” which
23:986:51561:18:18:101:510:268:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:will be justified in Section 6.  The impact of such task-specific technological progress is
23:987:51652:18:18:101:510:250:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:illustrated in a series of comparative statics in this section, which is possible since the
23:988:51743:18:32:101:320:232:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skill distribution is assumed to be continuous.

23:990:51822:25:18:101:510:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:First,  we focus on the comparative statics forˆh(j) and  ˆzwithin a sectori,  ignoring
23:991:51909:18:18:101:510:157:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sectoral reallocation.  Our exercise assumes that there is an increase in the exogenous
23:992:51996:18:16:101:312:139:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:productivity,M(j), of middle-skillj-tasks.22
23:993:52040:16:16:84:540:123:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:21A change in factor-neutral task-TFP,M(j), is different from an increase in the amount of skill working in
23:994:52147:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:any given task.  Since we model worker skill as human capital, the qualitative effect of a change in task-TFP
23:995:52256:12:8:72:492:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:is the same as if it were only capital-augmenting—e.g., a fall in the price of task-specific capital.
23:996:52357:8:15:84:539:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:22Thiswithin-sectorexercise is similar to Lemma 6 in Costinot and Vogel (2010), except that we have
23:997:52456:15:0:72:363:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:capital and, more important, the vertically differentiated manager.

24:1032:53455:18:18:101:510:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:wage per managerial skill (vertical polarization).  The within-sector comparative static
24:1033:53543:18:17:101:510:380:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for employment shares is depicted in Figure 8, and are consistent with the data we saw
24:1034:53629:17:18:101:205:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Figures 3 and 5(a).
24:1035:53651:18:18:117:510:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The mechanism for part 1 is the same as in Goos et al. (2014):  whenσ <1, the
24:1036:53728:18:18:101:510:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:exogenous rise in productivity causes factors to flow out to other tasks since tasks are
24:1037:53816:18:18:101:510:309:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:complementary, and we get employment polarization.  As in Costinot and Vogel (2010),
24:1038:53900:18:18:101:510:291:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this also leads to wage polarization in the presence of positive sorting.  What is new
24:1039:53986:18:18:101:510:273:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in our model is that this happens even in the presence of the vertically differentiated
24:1040:54073:18:18:101:510:255:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:management task, and that with stronger complementarity between workers and man-
24:1041:54153:18:18:101:510:237:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agers than among workers (i.e.,ω < σ <1), similar forces drive vertical polarization
24:1042:54237:18:18:101:510:219:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in terms of both wages and employment.  Another novel feature is the impact of this
24:1043:54320:18:33:101:486:201:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:task-specific technological progress on sectoral allocation, which we now explain.

27:1177:58737:29:27:101:278:515:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:where the equalities follow from(25).
27:1178:58774:27:27:101:226:488:11:g_d0_f29:11:g_d0_f5:ProofSee Appendix B.5.
27:1179:58796:27:17:101:510:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The additional assumption onηiensures that Lemma 2 holds even as the within-sector
27:1180:58878:17:18:101:510:444:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:share of managers increase and routine jobs decrease, as the sectoral employment share
27:1181:58964:18:18:101:226:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of manufacturing declines.
27:1182:58990:18:18:117:510:408:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:It is subtle but structural change in fact has two parts.  As a task becomes more
27:1183:59071:18:18:101:510:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:productive than others, selection on skills ensures that less resources are allocated to it
27:1184:59162:18:18:101:510:372:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:when we have complementarity across tasks (Proposition 2).  If one sector uses the task
27:1185:59249:18:18:101:510:354:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that has become more productive more intensively, resources reallocate across sectors
27:1186:59334:18:18:101:483:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:even holding fixed the sectoral allocation rule (Lemma 2).  This is the first part.
27:1187:59417:18:18:117:510:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The second part is that, as the manufacturing sector becomes more productive—
27:1188:59494:18:18:101:510:300:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:endogenously because it uses the task that has become more productive more inten-
27:1189:59575:18:18:101:510:282:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sively than services—the equilibrium price of its output falls relative to services.  The
27:1190:59664:18:18:101:510:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:strength of this force is governed by the elasticity between manufacturing and service
27:1191:59750:18:18:101:510:246:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:outputs, and with complementarity (- <1), more resources are allocated to services,
27:1192:59833:18:18:101:499:228:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as in Ngai and Pissarides (2007).  These two forces are formalized in Appendix B.5.
27:1193:59916:18:18:117:510:210:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The appendix also formalizes that structural change depends differently on the pro-
27:1194:59999:18:17:101:510:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ductivity of capital and labor, as is apparent from (19)-(20).  In contrast to both Ngai
27:1195:60087:17:18:101:510:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and Pissarides (2007) and Goos et al. (2014), capital is homogenous in our model but
27:1196:60171:18:18:101:510:157:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:labor is not, which is measured in two different types of skills.  Since labor productivity
27:1197:60262:18:18:101:510:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is determined by the sorting of individuals on skill, how task-specific TFP changes sec-
27:1198:60350:18:18:101:510:121:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:toral capital and labor input ratios depends not only on the task intensity of sectors,
27:1199:60437:18:0:101:300:103:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:but also on changes in the selection rules.
28:1200:60482:0:18:117:511:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Of  course  from  (28),  it  is  clear  that  structural  change  (change  in  ∆Li)  also  con-
28:1201:60577:18:31:101:470:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tributes to polarization.  To see this more precisely, rewrite (28) using (22) as

28:1233:60791:55:18:101:510:567:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f7:Lemma 4Suppose Lemma 2 holds.  Then structural change also contributes to polar-
28:1234:60871:18:27:101:136:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:ization.
28:1235:60879:27:18:101:510:522:11:g_d0_f29:11:g_d0_f5:ProofUnder Lemma 2, the term in the square brackets in (29) is negative forj∈J1,
28:1236:60959:18:27:101:207:504:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and positive forj=z.
28:1237:60979:27:18:101:510:477:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This is intuitive.  If manufacturing is more reliant on middle-skill tasks (that is, if it is
28:1238:61072:18:18:101:510:459:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more routine-intense), and shrinks as a result of polarization, this leads to even more
28:1239:61159:18:18:101:510:441:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:horizontal polarization in the aggregate economy.  The fact that manufacturing is less
28:1240:61245:18:18:101:510:423:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reliant on managers at the same time implies even more vertical polarization in the
28:1241:61328:18:18:101:193:405:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:aggregate economy.
28:1242:61346:18:18:117:510:387:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lemmas 2-4 are depicted in the first 3 subplots of Figure 9.  In Panel (a),  man-
28:1243:61427:18:18:101:510:369:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ufacturing is depicted as having a higher share in intermediate tasks, and services in
28:1244:61513:18:17:101:510:351:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:managers.   As  we  move  from  (a)  to  (b),  sectoral  employment  shares  are  held  fixed,
28:1245:61607:17:18:101:510:334:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and intermediate tasks shrink in both sectors.  The change in employment shares is
28:1246:61689:18:18:101:510:316:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:larger in manufacturing due to Lemma 2.  This leads to structural change in (c), ac-
28:1247:61773:18:18:101:510:298:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cording to Lemma 3.  Because manufacturing uses intermediate tasks more intensively
28:1248:61856:18:18:101:510:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and managerial tasks less intensively than services, shrinking its size contributes to the
28:1249:61946:18:18:101:510:262:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:horizontal and vertical polarization for the overall economy (not separately depicted).
28:1250:62033:18:18:117:511:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In the model, task-specific technological progress—changes inM(j)—shifts relative
28:1251:62114:18:18:101:510:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:employment shares as if the weightsνi(j) andηiwere changing, so the two are not sep-
28:1252:62198:18:18:101:510:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:arately identified in our comparative statics.  However, since the model is constructed
28:1253:62285:18:18:101:510:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:so that the time-invariant weights capture an initial distribution of employment shares
28:1254:62372:18:18:101:510:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:while task-specific TFP’s drive the changes over time, the assumptions we made in the
28:1255:62457:18:43:101:509:154:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:lemmas are valid insofar as they hold throughout our observation period in the data.23
28:1256:62543:43:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:23When  we  calibrate  the  model  to  the  1980  data—for  which  we  assume  thatM(j)  =Mfor  allj—
28:1257:62644:16:12:72:539:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the  calibration  naturally  admits  thatηm< ηsandνm(j)> νs(j)  for  a  wide  range  of  middle-skill  jobs.
28:1258:62752:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Furthermore, since occupational employment ratios between sectors are never flipped for most occupations
28:1259:62856:11:0:72:431:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:up to 2010, the quantitative analysis is robust to the choice of normalization year.

29:1265:63240:25:18:101:510:463:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:One may wonder if it is not task-specific productivities that lead to structural change,
29:1266:63328:18:18:101:510:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:but  advances  in  sector-specific  productivities  that  lead  to  polarization,  considering
29:1267:63422:18:18:101:205:427:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lemma 4 in isolation.
29:1268:63443:18:18:117:510:409:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:One important fact is that, in the context of our model, sector-specific productivity
29:1269:63528:18:18:101:510:391:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:changes do not lead to polarizationwithinsectors.  To see this, consider a change in the
29:1270:63616:18:18:101:510:373:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing sector’s exogenous productivity,Am.  As in Ngai and Pissarides (2007),

29:1272:63779:17:18:101:511:338:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:easily be seen that none of the thresholds change, and hence neither do the Φi’s (the
29:1273:63864:18:18:101:510:320:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:endogenous sectoral TFP’s).  So polarization in the overall economy can only arise by

34:1567:74758:18:18:101:510:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:so they are fixed for the rest of the calibration.  We then calibrate the other parameters
34:1568:74848:18:18:101:510:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:so that the implied thresholdsx1980andx2010are consistent with the 1980 and 2010

34:1570:74953:43:0:84:451:75:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:29The calibration yields a near linear increase in the skill loss parametersχjwithj.

35:1576:75459:18:18:101:511:618:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(M,Ai)  and  their  2010  levels  by  multiplying  them  by  their  respective  growth  rates.
35:1577:75553:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For example, the manager-task TFP in 2010 isM(1 +mz)30and similarly sectori’s

35:1579:75656:18:18:117:510:564:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This leaves us with 35 parameters to be calibrated: the elasticity parameters (σ,ω),

35:1583:75986:18:18:101:410:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:exactly fits the 1980 data moments in Appendix Table 5 exactly.
35:1584:76049:18:18:117:510:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Then  except  for  capital  per  worker,  which  we  plug  in  from  the  data,  all  other

35:1591:76581:33:18:101:510:334:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:DiscussionAs  implied  by  the  data  in  Figure  21(a)  and  Appendix  Table  5,  the
35:1592:76667:18:18:101:510:316:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing sector has higher intensity parameters among middle skill jobs and a
35:1593:76749:18:18:101:510:298:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lower intensity in managers.32Since the estimated elasticity between manufacturing
35:1594:76831:18:18:101:510:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and services is less than one, for structural change to occur, productivity needs to rise
35:1595:76920:18:18:101:510:262:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by relatively more in those occupations used more intensively by manufacturing, which
35:1596:77005:18:18:101:452:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are the middle-skill jobs.  This is evident from the last column in Table 3.
35:1597:77081:18:18:117:510:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The calibrated values forω= 0.34< σ= 0.70<1 are important both for Section 4

35:1599:77246:18:18:101:510:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:4,  it  is  validated  by  the  data.   The  only  other  paper  we  know  of  that  recovers  the

35:1601:77431:18:30:101:510:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which is much closer to 1 than ours.33However, theirs is an empirical framework that
35:1602:77515:30:7:84:448:124:7:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f8:30There are only 9 horizontal intensity parameters to calibrate per sector, since∑9

35:1604:77610:10:12:93:540:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:We target the linear trend from 1980 to 2010 rather than their exact values.  However, since most trends

35:1606:77783:8:12:84:539:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:32Since we normalizeMj≡Min 1980, the parameters correspond to skill-adjusted employment weights.
35:1607:77879:12:0:84:482:75:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:33Since manager is not a special occupation in that paper, it lacks a counter part to ourω.

36:1617:78664:18:18:101:510:515:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which were not targeted.  We also explore the model’s predictions in other untargeted

36:1620:78926:18:18:101:510:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:specific technological changes, we compare the benchmark model against versions that

36:1632:79809:18:18:117:510:224:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:At  first  glance,  it  may  not  be  so  surprising  that  we  obtain  a  more  or  less  exact

36:1637:80255:18:18:101:511:134:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:elasticity parameters (σ,ω) and 11 task-specific (and sector-neutral) growth rates, as

37:1668:81778:18:18:117:510:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Furthermore, we did not target any aggregate or sectoral employment shares, so the
37:1669:81860:18:18:101:510:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:fact that aggregate occupation shares and structural change by occupation (i.e.,  the

38:1680:82495:12:12:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:The quantitative model has 11 one-digit occupation groups.  For graphical representation only, we re-group

38:1685:82923:18:18:101:510:442:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:groups in our calibration, we do not exploit any other wage-related moments.  Before
38:1686:83007:18:18:101:510:424:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we further discuss the model’s implications for wage moments,  two clarifications are
38:1687:83092:18:17:101:510:406:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in order.  First,  in our model,  individuals’ earnings depends only on their skills and
38:1688:83180:17:18:101:510:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupation, not on sectors.  In the data, the average wage even for a narrowly-defined
38:1689:83266:18:18:101:510:371:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occupation  is  somewhat  higher  in  manufacturing  than  in  services—for  example,  see
38:1690:83356:18:18:101:510:353:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Appendix Figure 23(b).34We do not directly address this fact, and the average wages
38:1691:83439:18:18:101:510:335:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of broad occupation groups (e.g., workers as a whole or the manual, routine, abstract
38:1692:83524:18:18:101:510:317:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:categories) are different between the two sectors only to the extent that they differ in
38:1693:83612:18:18:101:454:299:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:how intensely they use the 10 underlying worker occupations in Table 3.35
38:1694:83685:18:18:117:511:281:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Second, Proposition 2 leads to polarization cast in terms of wage per skill (wzand
38:1695:83767:18:18:101:510:263:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f5:wh).  Our unit of observation is now wages, which equal (wage per skill)×(amount of
38:1696:83850:18:18:101:510:245:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skill).   Accordingly,  the  average  wage  of  an  occupation  changes  not  only  because  of
38:1697:83945:18:18:101:488:227:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:changes in its per-skill wage, but also because of selection on skill by occupation.
38:1698:84029:18:18:117:510:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Figure  12  plots  the  relative  mean  wages  of  occupations  (in  aggregate).   Manual
38:1699:84118:18:18:101:510:191:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and  abstract  wages  are  relative  to  routine  jobs,  and  manager  wages  are  relative  to
38:1700:84213:18:18:101:510:173:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all  workers.   While  the  model  trends  are  qualitatively  consistent  with  the  data,  i.e.,
38:1701:84311:18:18:101:510:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:horizontal and vertical wage polarization, the quantitative fit is not tight. In particular,
38:1702:84403:18:26:101:510:137:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the rise in the relative wage of the manager and abstract occupations is more muted
38:1703:84486:26:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:34However, the sectoral difference in the average wage of an occupation is stable throughout the observa-
38:1704:84591:16:8:72:439:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:tion period, so we consider the indifference assumption to be valid up to a constant.
38:1705:84676:8:15:84:540:87:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:35In this version of the model with discretized worker occupations, we only consider those equilibria in
38:1706:84780:15:0:72:365:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:which mean skill levels within occupations are equal across sectors.

39:1717:85337:18:18:101:510:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2  and  Figure  8,  barring  a  change  in  the  underlying  distributions  of  skills,  vertical
39:1718:85434:18:18:101:510:427:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:polarization dictates that new managers have less managerial skillzthan existing ones.
39:1719:85520:18:18:101:510:409:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This brings down the mean skill level of managers, countering the positive impact on

39:1721:85685:18:18:101:510:373:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Likewise,  horizontal  polarization  necessarily  implies  lower-hworkers  in  the  highest-
39:1722:85777:18:18:101:510:355:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:paying abstract jobs, attenuating the positive impact on their average wage from the
39:1723:85861:18:33:101:290:337:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:higher wage per skill (wjforj= 8,9).36
39:1724:85899:33:18:101:510:304:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:Average size of establishmentsIn our model, the production technology has
39:1725:85972:18:18:101:510:286:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:constant returns to scale, and the size distribution of establishments is not pinned down.
39:1726:86062:18:18:101:510:268:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:However,  because we model managers as a special occupation qualitatively separate
39:1727:86144:18:18:101:510:250:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from workers, the model does have implications on the average size of establishments
39:1728:86228:18:18:101:510:232:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as long as we assume a stable relationship between managers and establishments.  With
39:1729:86313:18:18:101:510:214:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:such an assumption, e.g., a constant number of managers per establishment over time,
39:1730:86397:18:18:101:510:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the faster vertical polarization in manufacturing, Figure 5(b), implies that the number
39:1731:86484:18:18:101:510:178:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of workers per establishment should fall faster in manufacturing than in services. This is
39:1732:86574:18:18:101:510:160:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:confirmed in Figure 13(a), which plots the average number of workers per establishment
39:1733:86660:18:17:101:452:142:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) from the U.S. Census Bureau.
39:1734:86730:17:26:117:510:125:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Furthermore, since the model generates vertical polarization by faster productivity
39:1735:86813:26:16:84:539:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:36Such selection does not matter for manual jobs (j= 0), because our discretized model assumes that all
39:1736:86916:16:11:71:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:workers contribute ̄h= 1 toward task-0 production regardless of theirh.  The increase in the manual job
39:1737:87019:11:0:71:340:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:wage is entirely due to the higher wage per effective skill,w0.

40:1749:87651:18:17:101:510:420:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:growth among manufacturing establishments.  In Figure 13(b), we divide value-added
40:1750:87733:17:18:101:510:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the NIPA by the number of establishments in the BDS, which confirms the model
40:1751:87813:18:18:101:152:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:prediction.
40:1752:87824:18:18:117:510:367:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:An  inconsistency  is  that,  while  the  employment  share  of  managers  has  grown  in
40:1753:87913:18:18:101:510:349:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the data, the number of employees per establishment overall has stayed more or less
40:1754:87996:18:18:101:510:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:constant throughout the observation period.  This suggests a need for modeling dif-
40:1755:88079:18:18:101:510:313:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ferentiated managerial occupations and hierarchies of management, which can capture
40:1756:88162:18:33:101:288:295:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the rise of middle managers since 1980.

40:1760:88453:18:18:101:510:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:stantially among managers, slightly among abstract workers, dropped among routine
40:1761:88534:18:18:101:427:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:workers and remained more or less constant among manual workers.
40:1762:88598:18:18:117:510:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:These qualitative patterns are replicated in our model, but the magnitudes of the
40:1763:88679:18:18:101:510:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:changes are too small compared to the data.  One way to address this is to increase
40:1764:88762:18:18:101:510:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the variance of the underlying skill distribution over time, which we decided against
40:1765:88847:18:18:101:510:118:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in order to isolate task specific forces:  We would be unable to separate the change in
40:1766:88934:18:18:101:510:100:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the skill distribution that is task-specific as opposed to task-neutral, without further

41:1769:89112:25:18:101:510:683:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The preceding subsections show that the model targeted only to within-sector employ-

41:1771:89281:18:18:101:510:647:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:albeit less in terms of relative wages.  Other non-targeted moments such as establish-
41:1772:89367:18:18:101:510:629:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ment size and wage inequality within occupations are also qualitatively consistent with
41:1773:89454:18:18:101:422:611:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the data.  We now focus on sectoral employment shares and TFP’s.
41:1774:89518:18:18:117:510:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To be more specific, we analyze the role of task-specific TFP’s on structural change

41:1776:89637:23:18:107:510:552:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(1)  We  restrict  all  task-specific  TFP  growth  to  be  equal,mj=mfor  allj,  and
41:1777:89722:18:18:127:510:534:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:instead let the exogenous sector-specific TFPs (Am,As) grow at ratesamandas,

41:1786:90364:23:18:101:510:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In both cases, we keep all other parameters at their benchmark values of Tables 2-3,

41:1788:90490:18:18:117:510:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We focus on sectoral TFP’s since in our model structural change results from the

41:1795:91042:18:18:117:510:186:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Instead, we focus on the evolution of sectoral TFP’s.  Note that the calibrated task-

41:1797:91217:18:27:101:510:150:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is more reliant.  Since the elasticity between sectors (-) is less than 1, we know from

42:1838:92158:33:18:101:510:470:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lemma 3 that the higher endogenous TFP growth in manufacturing leads to structural
42:1839:92240:18:18:101:510:452:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:change.   However,  our  benchmark  calibration  did  not  target  sectoral  TFP’s,  so  the
42:1840:92332:18:18:101:510:434:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:question is whether their growth can be explained by our benchmark with only task-
42:1841:92414:18:18:101:201:416:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:specific TFP growth.
42:1842:92434:18:18:117:510:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In our benchmark, we overshoot the growth rate of manufacturing TFP by about
42:1843:92510:18:18:101:510:380:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:half a percentage point per annum, while undershooting the services TFP growth rate
42:1844:92593:18:18:101:510:362:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by the same magnitude.  However, when we look at the growth rates of sectoral output
42:1845:92677:18:18:101:510:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(Figure 25), these gaps nearly disappear.  This is because while the model assumes that
42:1846:92764:18:18:101:510:326:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:capital and labor input ratios are equal across sectors, as shown in (21), in the data
42:1847:92850:18:18:101:510:308:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:they are not. In fact, counterfactuals (1) and (2) in Appendix Figure 25 show that when
42:1848:92937:18:18:101:510:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sectoral TFP growth is matched exactly, manufacturing output grows more slowly, and
42:1849:93020:18:18:101:510:272:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:services output more quickly, than in the data.  This implies that the capital input ratio
42:1850:93110:18:18:101:510:254:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:between manufacturing and services grew faster than the labor input ratio, although
42:1851:93193:18:18:101:510:236:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the differences are small.  Consequently, once we include exogenous sector-specific TFP
42:1852:93280:18:17:101:510:218:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:growth  and  target  the  empirical  sectoral  TFP’s,  both  counterfactuals  under-predict
42:1853:93371:17:34:101:366:201:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:manufacturing output and over-predict services output.

43:1879:94219:18:18:101:510:463:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that when we look at structural change within occupation groups, the benchmark out-
43:1880:94302:18:18:101:421:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:performs both counterfactuals (1) and (2), especially for managers.
43:1881:94369:18:18:117:510:427:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  benchmark  better  fits  employment  shares  than  the  counterfactuals,  despite
43:1882:94455:18:18:101:510:409:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:overshooting manufacturing’s relative TFP growth, because it has a better fit to sec-
43:1883:94540:18:18:101:510:391:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:toral output growth. As explained above, in the counterfactuals, sectoral output growth
43:1884:94627:18:18:101:510:373:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is too low in manufacturing and too high in services.  To the extent that all structural
43:1885:94715:18:18:101:510:355:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:change in our model is due to differential growth in sectoral TFP’s, we do not intend
43:1886:94800:18:18:101:510:337:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to emphasize too much that the benchmark explains employment shares better than
43:1887:94879:18:18:101:372:319:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the counterfactuals that explicitly target sectoral TFP’s.
43:1888:94937:18:18:117:511:301:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We do emphasize that exogenous changes in sectoral TFP’s cannot causewithin-
43:1889:95013:18:18:101:510:283:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sector polarization.  We still investigate their effect on aggregate employment shares
43:1890:95099:18:18:101:510:265:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by occupation (Lemma 4).  In Figure 17, we see that sectoral forces alone can account
43:1891:95184:18:18:101:510:247:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for 15-20 percent of horizontal and vertical polarization in aggregate.  This is slightly
43:1892:95273:18:17:101:510:229:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:smaller  than  the  back-of-the-envelope  calculation  in  Section  4.3,  which  showed  that
43:1893:95366:17:18:101:510:212:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the effect of sector-specific TFP’s on polarization is modest because both sectors use
43:1894:95452:18:18:101:161:194:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:routine jobs.
43:1895:95465:18:18:117:511:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In contrast,  task-specific TFP’s (mj’s) can account for almost all of the changes
43:1896:95547:18:18:101:510:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in  both  occupationalandsectoral  employment  shares.   At  first  glance,  it  may  seem
43:1897:95637:18:18:101:510:140:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that the effect of task-specific TFP growth on sectoral TFP’s—which drive structural
43:1898:95721:18:18:101:510:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:change—should also be modest since services also benefits from the faster TFP growth
43:1899:95805:18:18:101:510:104:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of  routine  tasks.   However,  differential  task-specific  TFP  growth  is  accompanied  by
43:1900:95898:18:0:101:510:86:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a  reallocation  of  heterogeneous  individuals  across  occupations,  which  endogenously

44:1933:96517:18:18:117:510:427:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To summarize, task-specific TFP growth can more or less fully account for sectoral

44:1935:96682:17:18:101:510:392:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the vertical and horizontal polarization induced by task-specific TFP growth, employ-
44:1936:96767:18:18:101:510:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ment shifts to the sector that relies less on routine tasks and more on management.
44:1937:96850:18:18:101:510:356:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Conversely, sector-specific productivities can only account for 15-20 percent of polar-
44:1938:96937:18:18:101:510:338:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ization in the overall economy; more important, we have shown both analytically and
44:1939:97020:18:33:101:510:320:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:quantitatively that they cannot cause polarization within sectors, contrary to the data.
44:1940:97108:33:25:101:502:287:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:6.4    What Explains Task-Specific Productivity Growth?
44:1941:97163:25:18:101:510:262:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Even  with  skill  selection,  horizontally  and  vertically  differentiated  occupations,  and
44:1942:97258:18:18:101:510:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:multiple sectors, Figure 18(a) shows that the bulk of the changes in occupational em-
44:1943:97343:18:18:101:510:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ployment shares are directly accounted for by task-specific TFP’s, with a correlation
44:1944:97428:18:18:101:510:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:coefficient of -0.97.  This is also confirmed by the regression in the top panel of Ap-
44:1945:97515:18:18:101:510:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:pendix Table 7.  This leads us to conclude that in order to understand changes in the
44:1946:97600:18:18:101:497:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:employment structure, it is important to identify what these task-TFP’s represent.
44:1947:97682:18:18:117:510:154:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:How much of the variation in the task-specific TFP growth rates can be explained
44:1948:97762:18:18:101:510:136:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by the widely-accepted routinization hypothesis—that routine jobs were more easily
44:1949:97844:18:19:101:510:118:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:automated  and  hence  now  employ  fewer  workers?   As  a  first  pass,  in  Figure  18(b)
44:1950:97936:19:16:84:539:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:39In Lemma 3, this is shown as the faster growth rates of the endogenous TFP components (ΠKi,ΠLi) in
44:1951:98036:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f5:services, which implies faster TFP growth inmanufacturing, given the expression for TFP (19) and assumed
44:1952:98140:11:0:71:289:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:values of elasticities.  Details are in Appendix B.5.

45:1978:99255:18:18:101:494:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which was constructed similarly but instead using O*NET, the successor to DOT.
45:1979:99333:18:18:117:510:343:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:While the task-TFP growth rates are positively correlated with both RTI indices

45:1986:99919:18:18:101:510:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:2010, has much of a relationship with the task-specific TFP growth rates.  Although

45:1989:100168:18:17:101:510:163:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:either.  Moreover, as shown in Appendix Table 7, the correlation between task-specific

46:2008:101519:18:18:101:510:426:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:college-related variables do not explain the employment shifts across occupations and
46:2009:101604:18:18:101:510:408:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sectors between 1980 and 2010.  This is in contrast to the preceding period:  Katz and
46:2010:101690:18:18:101:510:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Murphy (1992) finds that college variables can account for the changes in occupational
46:2011:101776:18:18:101:510:372:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:employment shares from the early 1960s to mid-1980s, which our own empirical analysis
46:2012:101861:18:18:101:232:354:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:affirms (not reported here).
46:2013:101889:18:18:117:510:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:What  we  do  find,  however,  is  that  the  task-specific  TFP  growth  rates  correlate
46:2014:101979:18:18:101:510:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:strongly with sub-indices constructed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) using O*NET,
46:2015:102058:18:18:101:510:300:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rather  than  the  RTI  index  which  aggregates  over  them.   In  particular,  as  shown  in
46:2016:102152:18:18:101:510:282:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Figure 19(b), the correlation of the task-TFP growth rates with routine-manual and

46:2018:102321:17:18:101:511:247:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and -0.77 respectively. Appendix Table 7 shows that theR2of the respective regressions
46:2019:102407:18:18:101:216:229:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is high at 0.64 and 0.59.
46:2020:102432:18:18:117:510:211:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We conclude that the technological progress since 1980 has predominantly enhanced
46:2021:102513:18:18:101:510:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the productivity of those occupations that are heavy on routine-manual tasks but light
46:2022:102599:18:18:101:510:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on interpersonal skills,  shrinking their employment shares and relative wages.  Since
46:2023:102685:18:18:101:510:157:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:routine physical activities are easy to automate but tasks requiring interpersonal skills
46:2024:102774:18:18:101:510:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are not, this finding points to automation as the channel of task-specific technological
46:2025:102862:18:22:101:510:121:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:progress.41In this context, our findings are consistent with the routinization hypoth-
46:2026:102948:22:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:41As discussed at the beginning of Section 4, the effect of a change in factor-neutral task-TFP is quali-
46:2027:103053:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:tatively similar to that of a capital-augmenting change, which for example could have been modeled as the
46:2028:103158:11:0:72:498:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:fall in the price of task-specific capital (Goos et al., 2014) and directly interpreted as automation.
47:2029:103262:0:18:101:510:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:esis.  The unexplained part of task-specific TFP growth may also come from endoge-
47:2030:103344:18:18:101:510:690:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:nous changes in the distribution of manager and worker skills, heterogeneous degrees of

47:2032:103519:18:39:101:287:654:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:all of which we have abstracted from.43
47:2033:103558:39:28:101:223:615:17:g_d0_f4:17:g_d0_f4:7    Conclusion
47:2034:103573:28:18:101:510:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We presented a multi-sector task-based model in which individuals with heterogeneous
47:2035:103657:18:18:101:510:569:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:skills select into managers or workers, and workers further positively sort into differ-
47:2036:103745:18:18:101:510:551:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:entiated tasks.  It is a tractable yet powerful framework for studying the occupational,
47:2037:103833:18:18:101:510:533:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:industrial and organizational structure of an economy.  We fully characterize the equi-
47:2038:103920:18:18:101:510:515:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:librium and prove that task-specific technological progress for middle-skill jobs leads
47:2039:104007:18:18:101:510:497:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to horizontal polarization, vertical polarization, and structural change.  Quantitatively,
47:2040:104097:18:18:101:510:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we  show  that  task-specific  technological  progress  fully  accounts  for  all  of  the  above
47:2041:104194:18:18:101:510:461:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:phenomena  in  the  data,  unaided  by  sector-  or  factor-specific  technological  changes.
47:2042:104287:18:18:101:510:443:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Consistent  with  the  model,  we  document  empirically  that  polarization  is  prevalent
47:2043:104378:18:18:101:510:425:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:within all sectors, including services, which suggests that trade is not the main driver
47:2044:104466:18:18:101:510:407:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of polarization.  Both in the model and in the data, horizontal and vertical polariza-
47:2045:104552:18:18:101:510:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tion is faster in manufacturing than in services,  causing structural change.  We also
47:2046:104638:18:17:101:510:371:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:show that task-specific technological changes since 1980 are fastest in occupations that
47:2047:104726:17:18:101:409:354:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:intensively use routine-manual tasks but not interpersonal skills.
47:2048:104792:18:18:117:510:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our model admits many useful extensions that have not been pursued here.  For in-
47:2049:104873:18:18:101:510:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:stance, one could embed individual skill dynamics to separate task productivity growth
47:2050:104959:18:18:101:510:300:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from human capital accumulation, or include differentiated managerial tasks for a more

47:2052:105130:18:18:101:510:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cially useful for understanding assortative matching between managers and workers,
47:2053:105212:18:18:101:510:246:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as well as for studying between- and within-firm inequality.  A quantitative analysis
47:2054:105297:18:18:101:510:228:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with  more  than  two  sectors  would  facilitate  a  sharper  decomposition  of  occupation-
47:2055:105390:18:18:101:510:210:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and  industry-specific  changes,  as  would  an  empirical  analysis  at  a  higher  frequency
47:2056:105484:18:18:101:510:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(e.g.,  annual rather than decadal).  A multi-country extension is feasible,  which will
47:2057:105572:18:18:101:510:174:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:help analyze trade, offshoring, and foreign direct investment.  We are actively exploring
47:2058:105661:18:21:101:241:156:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:some of these exciting topics.
47:2059:105691:21:16:84:540:135:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:42That is, the elasticity of substitution between capital and workers’ human capital may vary across tasks.
47:2060:105798:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:This would be related but distinct from typical models of capital-skill complementarity in which the elasticity
47:2061:105909:12:8:72:514:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:varies directly by skill, e.g.  low- vs.  high-skill as in Krusell, Ohanian, R ́ıos-Rull, and Violante (2000).
47:2062:106019:8:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f5:43In an open economy setting, cheaper foreign labor would be qualitatively similar to higher productivity
47:2063:106124:16:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:at  the  task  level.   We  note  that,  although  not  shown  here,  the  task-TFP  growth  rates  are  only  weakly
47:2064:106241:12:0:72:506:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:correlated with occupations’ offshorability index constructed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2011).

55:2570:121342:33:25:101:299:114:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:B.4    Proof of Proposition 2
55:2571:121371:25:15:101:510:89:12:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:Part 1.By Lemma 5, we know that no crossing can occur on (0,j) or (j,J), since
55:2572:121449:15:0:101:511:74:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ˆhandˆh1already coincide at the boundaries 0 andJ.  Similarly,  we also know from
56:2573:121532:0:16:101:511:708:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Theorem  1  that  it  can  never  be  the  case  that  there  is  no  crossing  (ˆh1(j)>ˆh(j)  or
56:2574:121629:16:20:101:510:692:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ˆh1(j)<ˆh(j) for allj∈J \{0,J}).  Hence, there must be a single crossing inJ1since
56:2575:121711:20:18:101:304:672:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lemma 5 also rules out multiple crossings.
56:2576:121753:18:18:117:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:At  this  point,  the  only  possibility  forj∗not  to  exist  is  if  instead,  there  exists  a

56:2579:122016:18:18:101:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:inj,  it must be the case thatˆh1′(0)<ˆh′(0),ˆh1′(j∗∗)>ˆh′(j∗∗) andˆh1′(J)<ˆh′(J).
