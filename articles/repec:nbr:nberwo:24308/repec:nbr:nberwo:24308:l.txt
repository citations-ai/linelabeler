2:35:2106:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:Using police accident reports for Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and exploiting the introduction of 
2:36:2203:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:the augmented   reality   game   Pokémon   GO   as   a   natural   experiment,   we   document   a 
2:37:2301:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:disproportionate  increase in  crashes  and  associated  vehicular  damage,  injuries,  and  fatalities  in 
2:38:2408:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:the  vicinity  of  locations  where users  can  play  the  game  while  driving.    We  estimate  the 
2:39:2509:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:incremental  county-wide  cost  of  users  playing Pokémon  GO  while  driving  to  be  in  the  range  of 
2:40:2615:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:$5.2  to  $25.5  million  over  the  148  days  following the  introduction  of  the  game.    Extrapolating 
2:41:2723:14:42:72:475:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:these estimates to nation-wide levels yields a total ranging from $2.0 to $7.3 billion.

3:53:3011:0:27:144:506:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the recent decade, smartphones and their applications or “apps,” as they 
3:54:3087:27:28:108:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  popularly  known,  have  become  ubiquitous.    No  doubt  this  technology  has  
3:55:3174:28:27:108:513:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:improved   the   quality   and   productivity   of   human   lives.      As   with   many   
3:56:3266:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:technological  advances,  though,  smartphones  have  been  taken  to  task  for  their  
3:57:3355:28:28:108:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:alleged  “dark  sides.”1    For  example,  smartphones  and  their  apps  have  been  
3:58:3441:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:accused  of  attributing  to  an  increase  in  teen  suicide,  a  deterioration  in  human  
3:59:3534:27:28:108:510:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpersonal  skills,  and  an  increase  in  cybersecurity  breaches.2    A  further  
3:60:3622:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, and the one that we investigate in this study, is the concern that the use 
3:61:3706:27:28:108:510:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  smartphone  apps  while  driving  has  given  rise  to  an  increase  in  vehicular  
3:62:3795:28:28:108:471:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes with associated increases in deaths, injuries and property damage.   
3:63:3872:28:27:144:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:As reported in the Wall Street Journal, insurers cite a possible connection 
3:64:3948:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:between smartphone usage and vehicular crashes as one explanation for the 16% 
3:65:4026:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in US automobile insurance premiums between 2011 and 2016.3  If that 
3:66:4104:27:28:108:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation were to account for, let’s say, 25% of the aggregate dollar increase in 
3:67:4188:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance premiums over that time period, the amount attributable to smartphone 
3:68:4268:27:45:108:259:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:usage would be $37.3 billion.

3:70:4360:8:16:108:507:206:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) example of concern with the dark side of technological 
3:71:4455:16:11:108:508:190:100:Times:100:Times:F:advances  is  the  displacement  of  weavers  by  mechanical  looms  that  led  to  riots  and  property  
3:72:4561:11:7:108:351:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:destruction in Lancashire, England, in 1826 (Aspin, 1995).   
3:73:4622:7:16:108:507:172:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 The  Economist,  January  13,  2018,  “Teens  and  Screens,”  p.  14.    BBC,  August  29,  2013,  “The

3:75:4830:12:7:107:227:144:100:Times:100:Times:F:Learn From Warren Buffett.” 
3:76:4858:7:16:108:508:137:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 Wall  Street  Journal,  February  21,  2017,  “Smartphone  Addicts  Behind  the  Wheel  Drive  Car  
3:77:4959:16:11:108:506:121:100:Times:100:Times:F:Insurance Rates Higher.  Insurers increasingly blame distracted drivers as costs related to crashes 
3:78:5059:11:0:108:226:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:outpace premium increases.” 
4:79:5089:0:27:144:510:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:Certain  circumstantial  evidence  supports  such  a  connection.    To  wit,  
4:80:5168:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:following  a  steady,  though  not  uninterrupted,  25-year  decline,  vehicular  fatality  
4:81:5260:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes  in  the  US  reversed  course  in  2011.    In  1988,  fatality  crashes  totaled  
4:82:5352:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:42,130.    In  2011,  that  number  reached  a  low  of  29,867.    By  2015,  the  total  had  
4:83:5448:28:28:108:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased  to  32,166  (NHTSA,  various  years.)    That  reversal  has  been  widely  
4:84:5535:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported and commented upon.  Less well reported is that total vehicular crashes 
4:85:5616:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:followed a similar course with 6.887 million reported in 1988 falling to a low of 
4:86:5698:28:27:108:478:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.338 million in 2011, and reversing course to reach 6.296 million in 2015.   
4:87:5776:27:28:144:509:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  supporting  circumstantial  evidence  is  that  diffusion  of  smartphone  
4:88:5856:28:28:108:510:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:apps  has  increased  in  parallel  with  the  incidence  of  vehicular  fatalities  and  
4:89:5946:28:27:108:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes.  According to Wikipedia, in 2008, Apple’s App Store had available 800 
4:90:6025:27:28:108:510:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:smartphone  apps  with  10  million  downloads.    By  2011,  those  numbers  were  
4:91:6109:28:27:108:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:500,000 apps and 18 billion downloads, and by 2017, they were 2.2 million apps 
4:92:6188:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  130  billion  downloads.4    Of  course,  attributing  any  increase  in  crashes  and  
4:93:6281:28:27:108:510:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:fatalities  to  smartphone  usage  and  app  availability  is  extraordinarily  difficult  
4:94:6372:27:28:108:511:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:given  that  many  other  factors  also  changed  over  the  years  in  which  both  
4:95:6457:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased.  The same WSJ article cited above notes that “[t]he rise in traffic deaths 
4:96:6543:28:27:108:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  the  result  of  many  factors.    Low  gas  prices  and  a  U.S.  economic  recovery  
4:97:6634:27:43:108:330:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:combined to put more drivers on the road...”   
4:98:6681:43:7:108:254:133:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:F:                                                            
4:99:6741:7:16:108:508:126:42:Times:100:Times:F:4  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS).    A  similar  trend  is  documented  for  the  other  
4:100:6846:16:0:108:485:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:large digital distribution platform, Google Play (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play).   
5:101:6944:0:27:144:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this study, we circumvent this difficulty by examining the introduction 
5:102:7019:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  a  specific  app  that  can  be  associated  with  specific  geographic  locations.    The  
5:103:7115:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:app  is  the  highly  popular  Pokémon  GO  augmented  reality  game.    The  game  was  
5:104:7204:27:28:108:511:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduced  on  July  6,  2016.    Within  one  month,  worldwide,  the  game  was  
5:105:7288:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:downloaded more than 100 million times.  For our purposes, the virtue of this app 
5:106:7370:28:27:108:511:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  that  the  stockpile  of  a  user’s  “weapons”  used  to  play  the  game  can  be  
5:107:7458:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:replenished in the vicinity of specific well-identified “PokéStops” many of which 
5:108:7540:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  located  near  public  thoroughfares.    If  the  game  is  played  while  a  player  is  
5:109:7635:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving and if playing the game while driving increases the likelihood of crashes 
5:110:7717:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurring, locations near PokéStops should experience a disproportionate increase 
5:111:7799:28:27:108:342:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:in crashes following introduction of the game.5   
5:112:7849:27:28:144:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:A:We examine nearly 12,000 police accident reports for Tippecanoe County, 
5:113:7921:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:Indiana, for the period of March 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016.  We find a 
5:114:8001:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionate  increase  in  crashes  near  PokéStops  from  before  to  after  July  6,  
5:115:8094:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:2016.    In  the  aggregate,  these  crashes  are  associated  with  increases  in  the  dollar  
5:116:8191:27:28:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount of vehicular damage, the number of personal injuries, and the number of

5:125:8938:13:20:108:465:130:100:Times:100:Times:F:nontrivial number of users are characterized in tweets as playing the game while driving.

6:127:9030:0:27:144:513:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:Specifically,   a   difference-in-differences   analysis   indicates   that   134   
6:128:9114:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:incremental crashes that occurred at locations in the proximity of PokéStops over 
6:129:9196:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  148  days  following  the  introduction  of  the  game  can  be  attributed  to  the  
6:130:9287:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction  of  Pokémon  GO.    This  incremental  increase  in  crashes  accounts  for  
6:131:9378:28:28:108:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:47%  of  the  increase  in  the  total  number  of  county-wide  crashes.    Based  on  the  
6:132:9471:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessments of damage in the police reports, this increase in crashes in the vicinity 
6:133:9557:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:of PokéStops results in $498,567 of incremental vehicular damage, or 22% of the 
6:134:9637:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in the total dollar amount of vehicular damage experienced county-wide 
6:135:9717:27:28:108:393:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:over the 148 days following the introduction of the game.   
6:136:9777:28:28:144:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:A:The 134 incremental crashes give rise to 31 incremental personal injuries 
6:137:9851:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the vicinity of PokéStops.  These account for 25% of the aggregate increase in 
6:138:9933:27:28:108:509:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  number  of  personal  injuries  experienced  county-wide  over  the  same  time  
6:139:10019:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:period.    Based  on  data  from  the  Insurance  Information  Institute  and  the  Centers  
6:140:10112:27:28:108:506:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:for Disease Control and Prevention, the incremental claims for bodily injuries and 
6:141:10195:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  estimated  loss  of  lifetime  income  imply  a  county-wide  total  incremental  cost  
6:142:10288:27:28:107:177:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:of $988,621.   
6:143:10303:28:28:143:506:231:144:Times:144:Times:A:On a sadder note, our analyses point to two incremental vehicular fatalities 
6:144:10380:28:27:107:508:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  vicinity  of  Pokéstops  following  the  introduction  of  the  game.    Based  on  
6:145:10473:27:28:107:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates  of  lifetime  income  lost  from  the  American  Community  Survey  Public  
6:146:10560:28:27:107:510:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:Use  Microdata  Sample  files  produced  by  the  Census  Bureau,  a  conservative  
6:147:10644:27:0:107:350:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate of the value of lives lost is $3.8 million.   
7:148:10701:0:27:144:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:Thus, a conservative estimate of the total incremental county-wide cost of 
7:149:10776:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:users  playing  Pokémon  GO  in  the  vicinity  of  Pokéstops  is  $5.2  million  over  the  
7:150:10869:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:148 days following the introduction of the game.  The great majority of this total 
7:151:10952:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  the  value  of  lives  lost.    Regardless  of  whether  that  number  is  included,  the  
7:152:11047:28:28:108:513:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:incremental  cost  of  users  playing  Pokémon  GO  while  driving  is  significant.    
7:153:11135:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:Indeed, even ignoring the value of lives lost, the incremental cost associated with 
7:154:11219:27:28:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:users playing the game while driving implies a 3.34% increase in auto insurance 
7:155:11299:28:27:107:430:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:premiums for the 148 days following the introduction of the game. 
7:156:11365:27:28:143:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:Ours  is  not  the  first  study  to  investigate  the  connection  between  mobile  
7:157:11450:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:phone usage while driving and vehicular crashes.  Bhargava and Pathania (2013) 
7:158:11529:28:27:108:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  McCartt,  Kidd  and  Teoh  (2014)  survey  this  literature.6    Both  report  that  the  
7:159:11624:27:28:108:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:results  of  prior  studies  are  inconclusive  as  to  whether  the  use  of  mobile  phones  
7:160:11719:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:while driving is associated with an increase in vehicular crashes.  The prior study 
7:161:11803:27:28:108:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:most closely related to ours is Bhargava and Pathania (2013) who also consider a 
7:162:11884:28:27:108:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural experiment.  They investigate whether mobile phone usage and vehicular 
7:163:11963:27:28:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes  increased  in  California  around  9:00pm  during  2002–2005.    During  those  
7:164:12052:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:years, mobile phone providers had a policy in effect whereby the per-minute price 
7:165:12134:28:23:108:508:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  mobile  phone  usage  dropped  precipitously  at  9:00pm.    The  authors  report  a  
7:166:12224:23:8:108:254:180:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:F:                                                            
7:167:12284:8:16:108:507:172:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 Prior studies include, among others, Cohen and Graham (2003), Hahn and Prieger (2006), Kolko 
7:168:12379:16:12:108:508:156:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2009),  and  the  classic  study  of  Redelmeir  and  Tibshirani  (1997).    A  number  of  authors  have  
7:169:12487:12:11:108:509:144:100:Times:100:Times:F:questioned  the  effectiveness  of  regulations  aimed  at  improving  automobile  safety  (Peltzman,  
7:170:12590:11:12:108:507:133:100:Times:100:Times:F:1975) and regulations restricting the use of cell phones while driving (Lim and Chi, 2013).  Abouk 
7:171:12689:12:11:108:507:121:100:Times:100:Times:F:and Adams (2013) study the effectiveness of bans on texting while driving and conclude that the 
7:172:12785:11:0:108:221:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:effect, if any, is short-lived. 
8:173:12819:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant  increase  in  mobile  phone  usage  while  driving  from  just  before  to  just  
8:174:12914:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:after 9:00pm, but report no increase in crashes.  This evidence implies that mobile 
8:175:12998:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:phone  usage  is  not  associated  with  an  increase  in  vehicular  crashes.    As  the  
8:176:13089:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:authors  note,  the  lack  of  an  effect  of  mobile  phone  usage  on  the  incidence  of  
8:177:13182:28:28:108:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes could, like the lack of a finding in certain earlier studies, be due to drivers 
8:178:13270:28:27:108:404:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:merely substituting one form of “risky” behavior for another. 
8:179:13332:27:28:144:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:A:In comparison with Bhargava and Pathania, the results of our study cannot 
8:180:13406:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:be  due  to  substitution  of  one  form  of  distraction  for  another  as  we  document  an  
8:181:13501:27:28:108:509:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  in  crashes  relative  to  the  level  that  would  have  occurred  absent  the  
8:182:13592:28:28:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction  of  the  game.    Our  interpretation  of  the  results,  however,  may  give  
8:183:13685:28:27:108:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:rise to two broad concerns.  First, it could be that the observed increase in crashes 
8:184:13771:27:28:107:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:is not due to the introduction of Pokémon GO but to another shock that correlates 
8:185:13853:28:27:107:509:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  the  introduction  of  the  game  and  vehicular  crashes.    In  that  regard,  one  
8:186:13945:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:concern specific to our analysis is that Tippecanoe County is the home of Purdue 
8:187:14026:28:27:107:510:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:University,  a  40,000-student  body  university  in  a  county  with  a  “fulltime”  
8:188:14112:27:28:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:population of 188,000.  The concern is that Pokémon GO was introduced during 
8:189:14189:28:28:107:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  university  summer  “break”  and  that  the  student  population  fluctuated  widely  
8:190:14280:28:27:107:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  that  time  period.    That  phenomenon  coupled  with  the  possibility  that  students  
8:191:14374:27:28:107:509:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:might  drive  more  in  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops  could  give  rise  to  our  
8:192:14467:28:27:107:510:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:results - - though the results would not be due to the introduction of Pokémon GO.  
8:193:14551:27:0:107:508:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  address  this  concern  directly  by  including  in  all  regressions  an  interaction  
9:194:14645:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:between PokéStop and university breaks.  Our results, thus, reflect the impact of 
9:195:14727:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:the introduction of the game after explicitly accounting for university breaks and 
9:196:14810:28:27:108:407:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:related fluctuations in the population of Tippecanoe County.   
9:197:14873:27:28:144:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:A:We  also  account  for  the  possibility  that  some  other  unspecified  omitted  
9:198:14956:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:factor might give rise to the increase in crashes that we document in the vicinity 
9:199:15039:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:of PokéStops following the introduction of Pokémon GO.  We do so by narrowing 
9:200:15117:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  time  interval  of  our  analysis  in  certain  regressions.    This  greatly  reduces  the  
9:201:15215:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of unobserved shocks that might spuriously give rise to our results since 
9:202:15296:27:28:108:510:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  narrowing  the  time  interval  employed,  we  exclude,  by  construction,  any  
9:203:15381:28:28:108:511:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:confounding   events   that   occur   outside   the   time   interval.      Contrary   to   the   
9:204:15479:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility that such unspecified shocks might spuriously give rise to our results, 
9:205:15563:27:28:108:455:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:the key coefficient is largest when a narrow time interval is employed.   
9:206:15637:28:27:143:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  second  concern  is  that,  although  the  increase  in  crashes  is  due  to  the  
9:207:15724:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction of Pokémon GO, it is not due to drivers playing the game.7  It is, for 
9:208:15808:28:27:108:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:example,  possible  that  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  increased  driving  near  
9:209:15896:27:28:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémon  GO-related  points  of  play  as  players  drove  to  these  locations  for  the  
9:210:15987:28:28:108:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:purpose  of  playing  the  game,  but  did  not  play  the  game  until  after  parking  their  
9:211:16083:28:27:108:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:cars.  In Section 5, and in the internet appendix, we undertake tests to address this 
9:212:16169:27:41:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:and related concerns.  To give a flavor of these tests, we briefly describe one here: 
9:213:16255:41:8:108:254:135:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:F:                                                            
9:214:16315:8:17:108:506:127:49:g_d0_f5:100:Times:F:7 In the state of Indiana, texting while driving is banned, but usage of mobile phones to play games 
9:215:16416:17:0:107:404:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:while driving is not (Indiana Code Title 9. Motor Vehicles § 9-21-8-59).   
10:216:16493:0:27:108:506:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:we use other Pokémon GO-related points of play, specifically “Gyms” (where it is 
10:217:16574:27:28:108:512:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:basically  impossible  for  a  user  to  play  the  game  while  driving)  as  placebos.    
10:218:16666:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:Assuming that both types of locations experience similar increases in traffic, and 
10:219:16749:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:assuming that players do not use their smartphones while driving, there should be 
10:220:16831:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:no  difference  in  the  change  in  the  number  of  crashes  between  the  two  types  of  
10:221:16924:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:locations.    We  compare  the  change  in  the  number  of  crashes  surrounding  the  
10:222:17012:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction of Pokémon GO in locations in the vicinity of Gyms with the change 
10:223:17092:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  number  of  crashes  in  locations  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops.    Consistent  
10:224:17186:27:28:108:511:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:with   the   use   of   smartphones   to   play   the   game   while   driving,   we   find   a   
10:225:17284:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly greater increase in the number of crashes in the vicinity of PokéStops 
10:226:17369:28:27:108:255:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:than in the vicinity of Gyms.   
10:227:17401:27:28:144:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:A:In sum, our analyses indicate that the concern by insurers and others that 
10:228:17476:28:27:108:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  use  of  smartphone  apps  by  drivers  did  contribute  to  increases  in  vehicular  
10:229:17568:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes,  injuries,  and  fatalities  is  legitimate.    In  this  instance  at  least,  there  is  an  
10:230:17672:28:28:108:360:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:economic dark side to technological advancement.   
10:231:17723:28:27:108:217:258:144:Times:144:Times:B:1.   Pokémon GO 
10:232:17739:27:28:144:513:231:144:Times:144:Times:A:Pokémon   GO   is   a   location-based   augmented   reality   game,   i.e.,   a   
10:233:17822:28:27:108:506:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:videogame that is played in a real world environment.  The game was launched in 
10:234:17902:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, on July 6, 2016, and soon became available 
10:235:17983:28:27:108:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  several  other  countries.    The  game  was  an  immediate  success,  exceeding  100

11:237:18160:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:downloads  by  June  2017.8    According  to  Wandera,  the  median  number  of  daily  
11:238:18248:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:“active users” was 24.7 million in July 2016.  A fact that we exploit later is that 
11:239:18332:28:27:107:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:the number of daily active users dropped to 17.6 million in August 2016 and fell 
11:240:18413:27:28:107:483:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:further to 9.5 million during September through November of the same year.9 
11:241:18488:28:28:144:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  objective  of  the  game  is  to  capture  one  of  each  type  of  virtual  
11:242:18570:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:creature,  called  Pokémons,  of  which  there  were  151  types  when  the  game  was  
11:243:18658:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduced.    A  Pokémon  type  is  identified  by  an  icon  of  a  virtual  creature  and  a  
11:244:18755:28:27:108:473:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:catchy name such as Bulbasaur, Omanyte, Rhyhorn, Vaporeon, and so on.   
11:245:18827:27:28:144:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:To play the game, a player opens an account, then selects and customizes 
11:246:18900:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:her avatar.  As the player moves within her real world surroundings (e.g., walks or 
11:247:18984:28:27:108:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:drives  along  a  street),  her  avatar  travels  along  a  virtual  map  that  parallels  the  
11:248:19080:27:28:108:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:actual  route  being  traveled  by  the  game  player.    The  virtual  map  appears  on  the  
11:249:19175:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:player’s mobile device.  The game employs the GPS radio navigation system that 
11:250:19254:27:28:108:509:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  built  into  the  player’s  mobile  device  to  locate  the  player  and  to  position  the  
11:251:19351:28:27:108:282:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:player’s avatar on the virtual map.   
11:252:19389:27:28:144:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:Pokémons  can  “pop  up”  at  any  time  and  at  any  location  on  the  player’s  
11:253:19473:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:virtual map.  Capture of a Pokémon is accomplished by “throwing” a Poké Ball at 
11:254:19553:28:27:108:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:the “popped up” icon.  Capturing the creature often requires multiple “throws” as 
11:255:19635:27:28:108:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  Pokémon  can  escape  even  after  being  hit  with  a  Poké  Ball.    Throwing  Poké  
11:256:19727:28:15:108:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:Balls  reduces  a  player’s  stock  of  ammunition.    A  game  player  can  reload  her

12:261:20095:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:called  PokéStops.10    As  a  player  approaches  a  PokéStop,  in  order  to  reload,  the  
12:262:20189:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:player  must  tap  the  icon  of  the  PokéStop  on  the  mobile  device’s  screen,  then  
12:263:20280:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:swipe  the  screen.    Thus,  collecting  Poké  Balls  can  be  accomplished  as  a  player  
12:264:20373:28:28:108:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:drives within the circle encompassed by the PokéStops.  (Of course, a player need 
12:265:20455:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:not  be  driving  to  collect  Poké  Balls.)    The  circle  has  a  radius  of  roughly  50  
12:266:20549:27:28:108:514:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:meters.      Driving   at   a   moderate   speed,   for   example   at   50   kilometers   
12:267:20640:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:(approximately 30 miles) per hour, a driver would pass through the area in which 
12:268:20721:27:28:108:387:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:Poké Balls can be collected in approximately 7 seconds.   
12:269:20779:28:28:144:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:A:To play the game, a player must first activate the app.  Activation requires 
12:270:20856:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:approximately 30 seconds.  Thus, driving at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour, a 
12:271:20937:27:28:108:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:player who had not previously activated the app must begin to activate the game 
12:272:21017:28:27:108:510:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:when  she  is  at  least  415  meters  from  the  PokéStop.    If  the  game  has  been  
12:273:21106:27:28:108:513:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:previously  activated,  the  player  needs  to  unlock  her  phone  to  play  the  game.    
12:274:21198:28:27:108:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:Unlocking the phone requires approximately  6  seconds.    Ergo,  a  player  who  had  
12:275:21285:27:28:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:previously activated the app must unlock her phone when she is approximately 85 
12:276:21365:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:or  more  meters  from  the  PokéStop.    In  sum,  the  activity  associated  with  playing  
12:277:21459:28:27:108:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:the game is likely to be concentrated within a circle of approximately 100 meters 
12:278:21541:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:around the PokéStops.  Activation of the game can extend beyond that perimeter 
12:279:21620:28:15:108:504:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:but activity is likely to become more intense as the player approaches this circle.

12:281:21766:7:16:108:507:126:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Poké Balls can be purchased anywhere.  PokéStops also enable players to collect, also for free, 
12:282:21865:16:0:107:447:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:other items such as incense to lure Pokémons or berries to cure wounded Pokémons. 
13:283:21950:0:27:144:509:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  addition  to  PokéStops,  the  game  features  a  second  set  of  locations  
13:284:22032:27:28:108:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:called  Gyms  in  which  battles  between  Pokémons  take  place.    Victory  in  battle  
13:285:22122:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:gives  the  player  Gym  Badges  and  PokéCoins  that  can  be  used  to  purchase  Poké  
13:286:22212:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:Balls  and  other  items  used  in  the  game.    To  complete  a  battle,  a  player  must  
13:287:22305:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:remain  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Gym  for  the  entirety  of  the  fight.    The  vicinity  of  a  
13:288:22407:28:27:108:512:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gym  encompasses  a  territory  of  the  same  dimensions  as  that  of  a  PokéStop.    
13:289:22496:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:Completion  of  a  battle  typically  requires  several  minutes.    Thus,  it  is  virtually  
13:290:22591:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:impossible  for  a  player  to  complete  a  battle  while  driving,  even  while  driving  at  
13:291:22687:27:28:108:260:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:an extremely moderate speed.   
13:292:22718:28:28:144:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  address  the  question  of  whether  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  
13:293:22795:28:27:108:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:resulted  in  a  disproportionate  increase  in  crashes,  damage  to  vehicles,  injuries  to  
13:294:22891:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicle occupants, and fatalities in the vicinity of PokéStops, we employ data on

16:364:28106:28:30:107:507:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:The interaction term PokéStop௅∙Post் is the independent variable of interest.  Its 
16:365:28189:30:27:108:509:217:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient  is  the  incremental  change  (i.e.,  the  difference  in  differences)  in  the

16:368:28426:8:16:108:507:160:42:Times:100:Times:F:12  Using  a  relatively  lengthy  time  period  prior  to  July  6,  2016,  offers  two  major  benefits.    First,  
16:369:28544:16:11:107:507:144:100:Times:100:Times:F:doing  so  increases  the  precision  of  our  estimations  since  the  weight  of  each  single  day-location  
16:370:28656:11:12:107:506:133:100:Times:100:Times:F:decreases as more days are added to the sample.  Second, it allows capturing more locations that 
16:371:28753:12:11:107:508:121:100:Times:100:Times:F:have  experienced  crashes  (including  locations  that  have  experienced  crashes  only  prior  to  the  
16:372:28860:11:0:107:214:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:introduction of the game.)

17:375:29029:28:29:144:512:617:144:Times:144:Times:A:Controls௅,்  are  a  set  of  time-varying  location-specific  control  variables.    
17:376:29115:29:28:108:515:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:The    location    fixed    effects,    Location௅,    account    for    any    time-invariant    
17:377:29212:28:28:108:508:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics  that  are  location  specific.    The  location  fixed  effects  account  for  
17:378:29308:28:27:108:507:532:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the location is in the vicinity of a PokéStop or any other location-specific 
17:379:29393:27:28:108:507:505:144:Times:144:Times:B:time-invariant  characteristic  that  may  correlate  with  the  frequency  or  severity  of  
17:380:29487:28:27:108:507:477:144:Times:144:Times:B:the crashes.  For example, in Tippecanoe County the most common locations for 
17:381:29565:27:28:108:507:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops are cemeteries, churches, memorials, and parks.  If these happen to be 
17:382:29646:28:28:108:508:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:high  traffic  areas,  the  location  fixed  effects  account  for  that  pattern.    The  date  
17:383:29743:28:28:108:511:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed   effects,   Date்,   account   for   any   location-invariant   characteristics   that   
17:384:29839:28:27:107:508:366:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlate  with  the  frequency  or  severity  of  crashes.    For  example,  a  date  might  
17:385:29933:27:28:107:513:339:144:Times:144:Times:B:follow   the   introduction   of   Pokémon   GO,   coincide   with   adverse   weather   
17:386:30022:28:27:107:509:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions,  or  coincide  with  high  traffic.    The  virtue  of  the  fixed  effects  is  that  
17:387:30121:27:28:107:506:284:144:Times:144:Times:B:they preclude the necessity of specifying and quantifying these or any other time- 
17:388:30204:28:28:107:379:256:144:Times:144:Times:B:or location-invariant sources of confounding variation.   
17:389:30262:28:28:143:510:228:144:Times:144:Times:A:  One  of  the  control  variables  in  each  regression  is  the  interaction  of  
17:390:30346:28:29:107:507:200:144:Times:144:Times:B:University Break் and PokéStop௅.  This variable accounts for the possibility that 
17:391:30428:29:28:108:507:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicular traffic is lower during university breaks with a consequential decline in 
17:392:30512:28:0:108:509:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes.    This  shift  in  traffic  might  be  especially  pronounced  in  the  vicinity  of  
18:393:30611:0:27:108:511:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops  if  university  students  tend  to  drive,  for  any  reason,  in  those  areas.    
18:394:30706:27:28:108:456:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:University Breaks are identified from the Purdue University calendars.   
18:395:30779:28:27:144:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  each  of  the  regression  estimations  that  follow,  the  standard  errors  are

18:400:31097:28:27:144:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:A: Our discussion of the results that follow focuses on the point estimates of 
18:401:31173:27:28:108:510:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coefficients, each of which is encompassed by an unstated confidence interval.  
18:402:31257:28:28:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  results  of  the  first  regression  are  given  in  the  first  column  of  Table  2.    The  
18:403:31357:28:27:107:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent  variable  is  the  total  number  of  crashes  at  a  given  location  on  a  given  
18:404:31453:27:28:107:511:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:day.      The   independent   variable   of   interest   is   the   interaction   of   Post   and   
18:405:31553:28:27:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop100 where PokéStop100 denotes locations that are within 100 meters of 
18:406:31631:27:28:107:509:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  PokéStop.    The  coefficient  of  this  interaction  term,  0.00097,  is  positive  and  
18:407:31724:28:27:107:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).  The coefficient is the point estimate of 
18:408:31811:27:28:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:the differential increase in the number of crashes per day within 100 meters of a 
18:409:31893:28:28:107:480:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop relative to locations that are not within 100 meters of a PokéStop.   
18:410:31972:28:27:143:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:A:The second column of Table 2 shows the results of a regression in which 
18:411:32044:27:31:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:the date fixed effects are replaced with Post and University Break.  The regression

18:413:32188:8:16:108:506:137:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 As an alternative to account for serial correlation, Bertrand et al. propose collapsing the data for 
18:414:32292:16:11:108:507:121:100:Times:100:Times:F:the  pre  and  post  time  periods.    We  also  collapse  the  data  and  replicate  the  analysis  of  the  first  
18:415:32409:11:0:108:503:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:column of Table 2.  The coefficient of the PokeStop100 x Post is 0.00099 with a p-value of 0.009. 
19:416:32510:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not include any interactions of PokéStop100 with Post or PokéStop100 with 
19:417:32589:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:University Break.  The purpose of this regression is to determine the county-wide 
19:418:32671:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:change in the number of crashes from before to after the introduction of the game 
19:419:32753:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:taking into account the occurrence of university breaks.  As shown in the second 
19:420:32834:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:column, the coefficient of Post is 0.00041 with a p-value of 0.002 indicating that 
19:421:32917:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  number  of  crashes  per  location  per  day  increased  significantly  in  the  period  
19:422:33011:27:28:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  followed  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO.    This  equates  to  a  county-wide  
19:423:33101:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase of 286 crashes over the 148 days from July 6 to November 30, 2016 after 
19:424:33182:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:taking into account the occurrence of university breaks (i.e., 0.00041 crashes per 
19:425:33265:28:28:108:514:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:day  per  location  x  4,708  geographic  locations  x  148  days  =  286  crashes).    
19:426:33353:28:27:107:511:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:According   to   our   analysis,   134   of   these   crashes   are   incremental   crashes   
19:427:33447:27:28:107:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributable to Pokémon GO users playing the game while driving in the vicinity 
19:428:33527:28:27:108:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  PokéStops  (i.e.,  0.00097  crashes  per  location  per  day  x  930  locations  within  
19:429:33620:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:100  meters  of  a  PokéStop  x  148  days  =  134  crashes).    Based  on  our  analysis,  
19:430:33712:28:27:107:512:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:these   134   crashes   would   not   have   occurred   had   Pokémon   GO   not   been   
19:431:33802:27:28:108:171:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduced.   
19:432:33816:28:28:144:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:A: As we noted above, the daily number of active users peaked in July 2016, 
19:433:33889:28:27:108:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:dropped  off  a  bit  in  August,  and  fell  further  in  September  at  which  point  the  
19:434:33982:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:median number of active users stabilized at 9.5 million per day for the following 
19:435:34064:28:27:108:510:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:two  months.    The  third  column  of  Table  2  exploits  this  discontinuity  in  the  
19:436:34154:27:0:108:507:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:intensity of play to explore whether the number of crashes varies with the number 
20:437:34239:0:27:108:504:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:of game players by splitting the post-July 6 interval into the subperiods of July 6–
20:438:34323:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:July  31,  August  1–August  31,  and  September  1–November  30.    To  do  this,  the  
20:439:34412:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression  includes  interactions  between  PokéStop100  and  indicator  variables  
20:440:34497:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:denoting the three subperiods.  The coefficients of the interaction terms decrease 
20:441:34580:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  time  proceeds  from  July  to  August  to  September–November  with  values  of  
20:442:34666:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.00164, 0.00117, and 0.00069 with associated p-values increasing from 0.004 to 
20:443:34746:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.033  to  0.047.    These  results  further  support  our  interpretation  of  Pokémon  GO  
20:444:34839:28:27:108:436:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:being the cause of the incremental change in the number of crashes. 
20:445:34907:27:28:144:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:  To  refine  our  identification  strategy,  we  focus  on  the  weeks  immediately  
20:446:34993:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:following the introduction of the game, July 6–July 31, 2016, in comparison with 
20:447:35074:28:27:107:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  same  time  period  in  the  prior  year.14    The  benefit  of  doing  so  is  that  by  
20:448:35169:27:28:108:511:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:narrowing   the   time   interval   of   analysis,   we   reduce   the   possibility   that   a   
20:449:35267:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:confounding event gives rise to the results.  Two deficiencies of this approach are 
20:450:35351:27:28:108:512:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1)   a   small   number   of   crashes   and/or   confounding   events   could   have   a   
20:451:35444:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionate  impact  on  the  coefficient  estimates  and  (2)  the  small  number  of  
20:452:35537:27:28:108:511:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:days  (i.e.,  52)  in  the  sample  period  substantially  reduces  the  power  of  the  test.    
20:453:35635:28:63:108:509:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nevertheless,  as  shown  in  the  fourth  column  of  Table  2,  the  coefficient  of  the  
20:454:35728:63:8:108:254:168:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:F:                                                            
20:455:35788:8:16:108:507:160:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 As we discuss in Section 5.4, beta testing of the game started as early as May 2016.  Using the 
20:456:35887:16:11:107:507:144:100:Times:100:Times:F:same  time  period  in  the  prior  year  eliminates  the  possibility  that  the  beta  testing  gave  rise  to  an  
20:457:36005:11:12:107:508:133:100:Times:100:Times:F:increase  in  crashes  prior  to  the  official  introduction  of  the  game.    Such  an  increase  would  
20:458:36113:12:11:107:507:121:100:Times:100:Times:F:downward  bias  the  estimate  of  the  incremental  impact  of  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  on  
20:459:36218:11:0:107:181:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:vehicular crashes. 
21:460:36240:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable of interest, Post interacted with PokéStop100, is positive and statistically 
21:461:36326:27:28:108:374:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant with a value of 0.00167 (p-value = 0.020).   
21:462:36383:28:27:144:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:A: To refine the identification strategy even further, we focus our analysis on 
21:463:36460:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  first  week  following  introduction  of  the  game,  July  6–July  12,  2016,  by  
21:464:36549:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparing the number of crashes per location per day during this period with the 
21:465:36630:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:equivalent  number  during  the  same  dates  in  2015.    We  use  this  particular  time  
21:466:36722:27:28:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:interval  so  as  to  exclude  the  Fourth  of  July  holiday  that  may  be  peculiar  with  
21:467:36816:28:27:108:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:respect to vehicular traffic.  The results are given in the fifth column of Table 2.  
21:468:36902:27:28:108:506:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:The coefficient is statistically significant (p-value = 0.095) and its value is further 
21:469:36990:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased  when  we  restrict  the  time  interval  of  analysis.    These  further  illustrate  
21:470:37087:28:27:108:510:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  connection  between  the  introduction  of  the  game  and  the  increase  in  the  
21:471:37176:27:28:108:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of crashes.  As we noted earlier, because these tests employ very narrow 
21:472:37256:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:time periods, it is increasingly unlikely that a shock other than the introduction of 
21:473:37342:27:28:108:296:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémon GO gave rise to the results.   
21:474:37381:28:27:108:427:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.3. Number of Crashes as Distance from PokéStops Increases 
21:475:37440:27:28:144:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:  As  we  described  above,  the  level  of  activity  associated  with  collecting  
21:476:37525:28:28:108:510:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:Poké  Balls  increases  as  players  approach  PokéStops.    To  further  investigate  
21:477:37612:28:27:108:506:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the explanation for the increase in crashes is the introduction of Pokémon 
21:478:37695:27:28:108:506:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:GO, we estimate regressions in which we redefine the key independent variable to 
21:479:37776:28:27:108:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect  differences  in  proximity  of  each  location  to  the  nearest  PokéStop.    These  
21:480:37871:27:0:108:518:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables     are     denoted     PokéStop50,     PokéStop100,     PokéStop250,     and     
22:481:37966:0:27:108:510:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop500,  where  the  numerals  indicate  that  the  location  is  within  a  given  
22:482:38055:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of meters of a PokéStop.  The results of the four regressions are given in 
22:483:38137:28:27:107:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 3.  Consistent with users playing the game while driving being the cause of 
22:484:38219:27:28:107:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  increase  in  crashes,  the  coefficients  of  the  interaction  variables  of  interest  
22:485:38314:28:28:107:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:decline  monotonically  from  0.00124  to  0.00027  as  the  distance  of  the  locations  
22:486:38405:28:27:107:403:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the nearest PokéStop increases from 50 to 500 meters.

22:488:38519:28:27:107:207:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.1.      Overview      
22:489:38543:27:28:143:506:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:The total incremental economic and human cost associated with crashes is 
22:490:38616:28:28:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  function  of  the  incremental  number  of  crashes  and  any  change  in  the  cost  per  
22:491:38710:28:27:107:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:crash.    The  analyses  above  calculate  the  increase  in  the  number  of  crashes  after  
22:492:38805:27:28:107:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlling for other factors.  In Table 4, we combine the increase in the number 
22:493:38887:28:27:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:of crashes with the change in the severity of crashes to calculate the incremental 
22:494:38970:27:28:107:509:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs  associated  with  users  playing  the  game  while  driving  in  the  vicinity  of  
22:495:39061:28:28:107:170:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops.   
22:496:39074:28:27:107:252:258:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2.      Vehicular      Damage      
22:497:39111:27:28:143:509:231:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  calculate  incremental  vehicular  damage,  we  first  compute  the  total  
22:498:39191:28:27:107:510:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:damage  to  the  vehicles  involved  across  all  crashes  that  occurred  at  a  given  
22:499:39280:27:28:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:location on a given day.  For most location/day pairs, this number is zero because 
22:500:39363:28:27:107:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:at most locations and for most days no crash occurred.  With this measure as the 
22:501:39444:27:0:107:508:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent  variable,  we  estimate  a  regression  as  in  equation  (1).    The  regression  
23:502:39541:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:isolates  the  incremental  damage  due  to  the  incremental  crashes  that  occur  in  the  
23:503:39635:27:28:108:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:vicinity  of  PokéStops  following  the  introduction  of  the  game.    The  results  are  
23:504:39727:28:27:107:303:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported in the first column of Table 4.   
23:505:39770:27:28:143:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  coefficient  of  the  key  interaction  term  of  PokéStop100  and  Post  is  
23:506:39853:28:28:107:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive  and  statistically  significant  with  a  value  of  $3.62225  (p-value  =  0.060).    
23:507:39950:28:27:107:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:This coefficient is the difference in the change in the damage to the vehicles per 
23:508:40033:27:28:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:location  per  day  at  locations  within  100  meters  of  a  PokéStop  versus  locations  
23:509:40125:28:27:107:506:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are not within 100 meters of a PokéStop.  The coefficient implies incremental 
23:510:40208:27:28:107:506:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate damage to vehicles of $498,567 due to crashes that occurred within 100 
23:511:40289:28:28:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:meters  of  PokéStops  over  the  148  days  of  July  6  to  November  30,  2016  (i.e.,  
23:512:40380:28:27:107:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:$3.62225 per location per day x 930 locations within 100 meters of a PokéStop x 
23:513:40460:27:28:107:509:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:148  days  =  $498,567).    Thus,  our  analysis  shows  that  $498,567  of  vehicular  
23:514:40548:28:27:107:438:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:damage would not have occurred had the game not been introduced. 
23:515:40613:27:28:143:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a benchmark for comparison, we calculate the county-wide increase in 
23:516:40685:28:27:107:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicular  damage  from  before  to  after  introduction  of  the  game.    To  do  this,  we  
23:517:40780:27:28:107:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate  a  regression  in  which  the  dependent  variable  is  the  same  as  in  the  
23:518:40870:28:28:107:510:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous regression, but the independent variables are Post and University Break.  
23:519:40953:28:27:107:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:The regression does not include date fixed effects or interaction terms.  As shown 
23:520:41036:27:28:107:506:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the second regression of Table 4, Tippecanoe County experienced a significant 
23:521:41117:28:27:107:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  of  $3.25748  in  vehicular  damage  per  location  per  day  in  the  period  that  
23:522:41212:27:0:107:509:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:followed  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  relative  to  the  prior  period.    This  
24:523:41304:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:equates to $2,269,760 over the 148 days from July 6 to November 30, 2016 (i.e., 
24:524:41384:27:28:108:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:$3.25748  per  location  per  day  x  4,708  geographic  locations  x  148  days  =  
24:525:41469:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:$2,269,760).    Based  on  these  analyses,  the  incremental  aggregate  damage  to  
24:526:41555:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicles attributable to Pokémon GO users playing the game while driving in the 
24:527:41635:28:28:108:503:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:vicinity of PokéStops accounts for 22% of the increase in the incremental county-
24:528:41716:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:wide vehicular damage experienced over the 148 days that followed introduction 
24:529:41795:27:28:108:327:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:of Pokémon GO (i.e., $498,567/$2,269,760). 
24:530:41838:28:27:108:256:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.3.      Cost of Bodily Injuries 
24:531:41872:27:28:144:507:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:To calculate the incremental number of persons injured, we first determine 
24:532:41947:28:28:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  total  number  of  persons  injured  across  all  crashes  at  a  given  location  on  a  
24:533:42042:28:27:107:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:given  day.    With  this  as  the  dependent  variable,  we  estimate  a  regression  as  in  
24:534:42137:27:28:107:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation  (1).    The  regression  isolates  the  incremental  number  of  persons  injured  
24:535:42230:28:27:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:in crashes that occurred in the vicinity of PokéStops following the introduction of 
24:536:42314:27:28:107:410:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémon GO.  The third column of Table 4 gives the results.   
24:537:42376:28:27:143:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  coefficient  of  the  key  interaction  term  is  positive,  0.000222,  but  not  
24:538:42463:27:28:107:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:quite  statistically  significant  at  conventional  levels  (p-value  of  0.106).    This  
24:539:42555:28:28:107:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient  is  the  difference  in  the  change  in  the  number  of  persons  injured  in  
24:540:42649:28:27:107:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes per location per day at locations within 100 meters of a PokéStop versus 
24:541:42730:27:28:107:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:locations  that  are  not  within  100  meters  of  a  PokéStop.    The  value  of  the  
24:542:42819:28:27:107:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient implies an incremental change of 31 in the number of persons injured 
24:543:42900:27:0:107:509:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:during  the  148  days  from  July  6  to  November  30,  2016,  due  to  crashes  that  
25:544:42992:0:27:108:509:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurred  within  100  meters  of  PokéStops  (i.e.,  0.000222  incremental  persons  
25:545:43078:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:injured per location per day x 930 locations x 148 days).  Based on our analysis, 
25:546:43160:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:31  fewer  persons  would  have  been  injured  over  this  period  in  vehicular  crashes  
25:547:43252:27:28:108:298:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:had Pokémon GO not been introduced. 
25:548:43288:28:28:144:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  provide  a  basis  for  comparison,  the  fourth  regression  isolates  the  
25:549:43369:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:change  in  the  number  of  county-wide  injuries  in  the  period  that  followed  the  
25:550:43459:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction of the game.  The coefficient of Post shows a statistically significant 
25:551:43544:28:27:108:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  of  0.000176  (p-value  <  0.001)  in  the  number  of  persons  injured  in  
25:552:43632:27:28:108:507:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicular crashes per geographic location per day in the period that followed the 
25:553:43714:28:28:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction  of  Pokémon  GO.    This  implies  that  123  additional  persons  were  
25:554:43801:28:27:108:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:injured  over  the  148  days  from  July  6  to  November  30,  2016,  relative  to  the  
25:555:43892:27:28:108:509:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:period  prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  game  (i.e.,  0.000176  persons  injured  per

25:557:44075:27:28:108:509:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:number  of  people  injured  attributable  to  Pokémon  GO  users  playing  the  game  
25:558:44162:28:27:108:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:while  driving  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops  accounts  for  25%  of  the  county-wide  
25:559:44254:27:28:108:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  in  the  number  of  persons  injured  over  the  148  days  that  followed  the  
25:560:44346:28:28:108:380:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction of the game (i.e., 31/123 persons injured).   
25:561:44405:28:27:144:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:A:We use two approaches to assess the incremental cost of injuries to drivers 
25:562:44481:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  passengers.    In  the  first,  we  use  the  dollar  value  of  insurance  claims.    In  the  
25:563:44582:28:0:108:497:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:second, we use the value of a statistical injury from Viscusi and Gentry (2015).   
26:564:44668:0:27:144:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:A:The dollar value of insurance claims comprises two components: the claim 
26:565:44741:27:28:108:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  bodily  injuries  and  the  claim  for  lost  lifetime  income.    According  to  the

26:568:45004:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  U.S.  during  2015–2016  was  $16,427.    To  calculate  the  lifetime  income  loss  
26:569:45095:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:due  to  lost  time  at  work,  we  use  data  from  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  
26:570:45190:27:28:108:510:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:Prevention     (CDC,     https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/crash-injuries/index.html).  
26:571:45275:28:27:108:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:According  to  the  CDC,  total  lifetime  work  lost  in  the  U.S.  in  2012  due  to  
26:572:45364:27:28:108:507:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:vehicular crash injuries was $33 billion.  According to the NHTSA (2013), there 
26:573:45444:28:28:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:were  2.134  million  traffic  crash  injuries  in  2012.15    These  statistics  imply  an  
26:574:45537:28:27:107:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:average  lifetime  income  loss  of  $15,464  per  injury.    Given  the  31  incremental  
26:575:45628:27:28:107:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:injuries in Tippecanoe County due to Pokémon GO users playing the game while 
26:576:45705:28:27:107:509:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops,  the  estimated  total  incremental  insurance  
26:577:45796:27:28:107:510:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:claims  for  injuries  is  $988,621  (i.e.,  ($16,427  +  $15,464)  x  31  incremental  
26:578:45884:28:27:107:159:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:injuries).   
26:579:45897:27:28:143:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:According  to  Viscusi  and  Gentry  (2015),  the  value  of  a  statistical  injury  
26:580:45983:28:28:107:509:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  transportation-related  events  ranges  from  $70,000  to  $210,000.    Using  the  
26:581:46072:28:27:107:506:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:mid-point of this range as the cost per injured person, the total incremental cost of 
26:582:46158:27:28:108:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:injuries  is  $4.34  million  due  to  users  playing  the  game  while  driving  in  the

27:595:47226:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:premium  is  3.34%  assuming  that  every  year-round  resident  of  the  county  of  age

27:598:47382:28:27:144:511:341:144:Times:144:Times:A:To   calculate   the   incremental   number   of   human   lives   lost,   we   first   
27:599:47470:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:determine the total number of lives lost across all crashes that occurred at a given 
27:600:47555:28:27:108:506:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:location on a given day.  The fifth regression in Table 4 uses this as the dependent 
27:601:47640:27:28:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable.    The  coefficient  of  the  key  interaction  term,  PokéStop100  x  Post,  is  
27:602:47732:28:28:107:510:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive  and  statistically  significant  with  a  value  of  0.000017  (p-value  =  0.041).    
27:603:47829:28:27:107:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  value  of  the  coefficient  implies  an  incremental  increase  of  two  fatalities  
27:604:47920:27:43:108:510:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:during  the  148  days  from  July  6  to  November  30,  2016,  due  to  crashes  that

27:606:48069:7:16:108:506:126:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 We use the cut-off of 15 years or older because the census does not give a category of 16 years 
27:607:48168:16:0:107:176:110:100:Times:100:Times:F:of age or older.   
28:608:48190:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurred within 100 meters of PokéStops (i.e., 0.000017 fatalities per location per 
28:609:48274:27:28:108:339:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:day x 930 locations x 148 days = 2.3 fatalities). 
28:610:48324:28:27:144:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  sixth  regression  provides  a  benchmark  by  showing  that  Tippecanoe  
28:611:48403:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:County  experienced  a  decline  of  one  fatality  related  to  vehicular  crashes  per  
28:612:48493:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:geographic  location  per  day  in  the  period  that  followed  the  introduction  of  the  
28:613:48586:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:game (coefficient = -0.00000074) relative to the pre-Pokémon GO period.  Thus, 
28:614:48665:27:28:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:our  analyses  indicate  that  in  the  absence  of  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO,  
28:615:48755:28:27:108:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:fatalities would have declined by three rather than one, for a net of two lives that 
28:616:48840:27:28:108:240:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:would not have been lost.   
28:617:48868:28:28:144:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:A:Attaching  a  value  to  a  human  life  is  always  problematic.    We  use  two  
28:618:48951:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:approaches.  In the first, we compute lifetime income lost.  In the second we use 
28:619:49033:27:28:108:406:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:the value of a statistical life from Viscusi and Gentry (2015).  
28:620:49098:28:27:144:510:341:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  calculate  lifetime  income  lost  per  fatality,  we  multiply  the  annual  
28:621:49180:27:28:108:510:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:income  per  capita  of  full-time  employees  in  the  cities  of  Lafayette  and  West  
28:622:49270:28:27:108:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lafayette, Indiana, from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata 
28:623:49346:27:28:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sample files produced by the Census Bureau17 by the difference between average 
28:624:49425:28:28:108:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:life  expectancy  in  the  US  and  the  median  age  of  persons  who  died  in  vehicular  
28:625:49518:28:27:108:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes in our sample.  To calculate the total lost income, we multiply the loss of 
28:626:49602:27:28:108:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:income  per  fatality  by  the  number  of  fatalities.    The  calculation  yields  a  total  of  
28:627:49701:28:25:108:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:$3,760,000 in lost income due to drivers playing  Pokémon  GO  in  the  vicinity  of

29:631:50001:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:number  aligns  with  the  estimate  from  Ashenfelter  and  Greenstone  (2004)  who  
29:632:50087:28:27:108:506:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculate an upper bound of $1.54 million as the value of a statistical life based on 
29:633:50173:27:28:108:502:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:hours of work saved due to a change in the speed limits on rural interstate roads.   
29:634:50258:28:28:144:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:A:Viscusi  and  Gentry  (2015)  report  an  estimated  range  of  $6.9  to  $13.8  
29:635:50339:28:27:108:511:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:million for the value of a statistical life based on transportation related fatalities.  
29:636:50428:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:Using the mid-point of the range reported by Viscusi and Gentry, the incremental 
29:637:50509:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of lives lost due to users playing the game while driving in the proximity of 
29:638:50593:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops  is  $20.7  million  ($10.35  million  x  2  lives  lost).    Table  5  summarizes  
29:639:50687:28:28:108:343:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:the estimated value of the incremental lives lost. 
29:640:50738:28:27:144:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:Using  the  more  conservative  estimate  of  the  value  of  incremental  lives  
29:641:50820:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:lost, and assuming that every year-round resident of the county of age 15 or older 
29:642:50903:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:is an insured driver, the implied increase in insurance premiums is 11.77% for the 
29:643:50986:27:28:108:351:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:148 days that follow the introduction of the game. 
29:644:51037:28:27:108:224:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.5.      Commentary      
29:645:51063:27:28:144:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:Clearly,  regardless  of  how  the  number  is  calculated,  the  value  of  human  
29:646:51147:28:28:108:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:lives  lost  swamps  all  other  costs.    Holding  aside  that  cost,  our  estimate  of  other  
29:647:51245:28:27:108:508:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs is likely to be downward biased in that we do not include such items as the 
29:648:51327:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs of police, firefighters, ambulances, road assistance, rental cars, and damage 
29:649:51411:28:27:108:509:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  other  property.    Additionally,  our  total  reflects  only  the  incremental  cost  of  
29:650:51506:27:0:108:508:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:users playing Pokémon GO while driving in the proximity of PokéStops.  It does 
30:651:51588:0:27:108:509:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:not  include  any  cost  due  to  crashes  related  to  players  attempting  to  capture  
30:652:51678:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémons while driving not in the vicinity of PokéStops.  It also does not include 
30:653:51761:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  costs  of  crashes  not  reported  to  the  police  that  are  attributable  to  the  drivers  
30:654:51861:27:28:108:203:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:playing the game.   
30:655:51881:28:28:144:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:A:Regardless  of  how  they  are  calculated,  the  incremental  economic  and  
30:656:51959:28:27:108:460:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:human costs of users playing Pokémon GO while driving are significant. 
30:657:52030:27:28:108:234:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.    Robustness Tests 
30:658:52053:28:27:108:315:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.1.      Alternative Interpretations: Traffic 
30:659:52100:27:28:144:509:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  possible  alternative  explanation  of  the  results  is  that  the  increase  in  
30:660:52186:28:28:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes  near  PokéStops  reflects  an  increase  in  traffic  due  to  players  driving  to  
30:661:52280:28:27:108:506:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops, parking their vehicles then playing the game.  Thus, while the increase 
30:662:52363:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:in crashes near PokéStops is attributable to the introduction of Pokémon GO, it is 
30:663:52446:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:not due to users playing the game while driving.  To address that possibility, we 
30:664:52528:27:28:108:462:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:conduct three tests, the third of which is reported in an internet appendix. 
30:665:52605:28:27:144:509:286:144:Times:144:Times:A:First,  we  use  Gyms  as  a  placebo.    As  we  noted,  Gyms  are  locations  in  
30:666:52689:27:28:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  Pokémon  GO  related  activities  take  place,  but  these  activities  cannot  take  
30:667:52782:28:28:107:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:place while the player is driving.  If the alternative explanation, that the increase 
30:668:52868:28:27:107:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  crashes  near  PokéStops  is  the  result  of  an  increase  in  traffic  is  correct,  it  
30:669:52964:27:28:107:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows that an increase in crashes should also occur in the vicinity of Gyms.  To 
30:670:53047:28:27:108:510:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:investigate  that  possibility,  we  estimate  a  regression  similar  to  the  baseline  
30:671:53137:27:0:108:509:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression  in  the  first  column  of  Table  2,  with  the  only  difference  being  that  
31:672:53233:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:instead  of  comparing  locations  in  the  proximity  of  PokéStops  to  locations  not  in  
31:673:53327:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:the proximity of PokéStops, we compare locations in the proximity of PokéStops 
31:674:53406:28:27:108:511:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  locations  in  the  proximity  of  Gyms  that  are  not  in  the  proximity  of  
31:675:53493:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops.  The number of locations included in this regression is 1,053.  Those 
31:676:53574:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:1,053  locations  include  930  locations  that  are  within  100  meters  of  a  PokéStop  
31:677:53666:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:while  123  are  within  100  meters  of  a  Gym  and  not  also  within  100  meters  of  a  
31:678:53760:27:28:108:160:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop. 
31:679:53770:28:27:144:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  results  of  the  regression  are  given  in  first  column  of  Table  6.    If  the  
31:680:53862:27:28:108:511:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternative  explanation  is  correct,  the  coefficient  of  the  interaction  between  
31:681:53951:28:28:108:506:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop100 and Post would be statistically indistinguishable from zero.  Instead, 
31:682:54034:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  coefficient  is  positive  and  statistically  significant  (p-value  =  0.026)  and  even  
31:683:54131:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater in magnitude than the coefficient in the baseline regression.  These results 
31:684:54216:28:27:108:343:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:are inconsistent with the alternative explanation. 
31:685:54267:27:28:144:511:314:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  the  second  test,  we  estimate  a  regression  similar  to  the  baseline  
31:686:54348:28:27:108:506:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression except that we add the change in the number crashes in the circle (of a 
31:687:54431:27:28:108:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:500  meters  radius)  that  surrounds  each  geographic  location  as  an  additional  
31:688:54518:28:28:108:508:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:control variable.  By doing so, we recognize that if traffic increased in the circle 
31:689:54603:28:27:108:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:surrounding a location, crashes would also increase in that circle.  Importantly, we 
31:690:54688:27:28:108:507:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:assume  that  for  traffic  to  increase  at  locations  in  the  proximity  of  PokéStops  (as  
31:691:54785:28:27:108:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:players  drive  to  those  locations),  traffic  also  must  increase  along  the  route  that  
31:692:54881:27:0:108:509:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:takes  players  to  such  locations  -  -  if  players  were  walking  to  locations  in  the  
32:693:54979:0:27:108:509:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:proximity  of  PokéStops,  vehicular  traffic  and  traffic-related  crashes  would  not  
32:694:55069:27:28:108:159:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase.   
32:695:55081:28:27:144:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  compute  the  change  in  the  number  of  daily  crashes  within  the  circle  
32:696:55165:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:surrounding  each  location,  we  exclude  crashes  at  the  location  in  question  and  
32:697:55255:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes (within the circle) that are within 100 meters of a PokéStop.  The first are 
32:698:55340:28:27:108:510:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:excluded  because  they  are  the  dependent  variable;  the  second  are  excluded  
32:699:55425:27:28:108:511:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:because  those  crashes  may  be  attributable  to  users  playing  the  game  while  
32:700:55511:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving.  To capture changes in traffic, we compute the average daily total number 
32:701:55594:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  crashes  in  the  500  meter  circle  for  the  period  that  follows  the  introduction  of  
32:702:55692:28:28:108:510:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémon GO, as well as for the period that precedes the introduction of the game.  
32:703:55775:28:27:108:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:Because  of  the  inclusion  of  location  fixed  effects  in  the  regression,  the  variable  
32:704:55871:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:No. of Crashes within 500 Meters of Location L captures the change in vehicular 
32:705:55951:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes in the period that follows the introduction of Pokémon GO relative to the 
32:706:56033:27:28:108:349:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:period that precedes the introduction of the game. 
32:707:56084:28:27:144:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:A:Contrary  to  the  notion  that  an  increase  in  traffic  gives  rise  to  our  results,  
32:708:56176:27:28:108:511:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:the   proxy   for   the   change   in   traffic   in   the   area   surrounding   a   location   is   
32:709:56278:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:insignificantly related to the change in crashes at the location in question (p-value 
32:710:56364:28:27:108:510:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:=  0.620).    More  importantly,  the  coefficient  of  the  key  interaction  between  
32:711:56452:27:0:108:467:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop100 and Post remains statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).   
33:712:56531:0:27:108:339:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.2.      Alternative Interpretations: Pedestrians 
33:713:56582:27:28:144:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our  sample  includes  42  instances  in  which  an  action(s)  by  pedestrians  is  
33:714:56667:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:given in the police report as being the primary cause of the crash.  Of these, four 
33:715:56751:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurred  after  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO.    To  rule  out  the  possibility  that  
33:716:56846:28:28:107:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  increase  in  crashes  is  due  to  pedestrians  playing  the  game,  we  omit  these  
33:717:56938:28:27:107:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations from the sample and re-estimate the baseline regression.  The results 
33:718:57021:27:28:107:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:are shown in the third column of Table 6.  The coefficient of PokéStop100 x Post 
33:719:57102:28:27:107:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  0.00095  (p-value  <  0.001).    Thus,  the  increase  in  crashes  in  the  proximity  of  
33:720:57198:27:28:108:472:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStops following the introduction of the game is not due to pedestrians. 
33:721:57274:28:28:108:367:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.3. Cause of Crashes Given in the Police Reports 
33:722:57324:28:27:144:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  sample  includes  213  crashes  where  the  “primary  cause”  given  in  the  
33:723:57407:27:28:107:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:police  accident  reports  is  either  “Cell  Phone  Usage”  (N=24),  “Driver  Asleep  or  
33:724:57498:28:27:107:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:Fatigued”  (N=54),  or  “Driver  Distracted”  (N=135).    We  label  these  “distracted  
33:725:57587:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:driver”  crashes.    It  is  commonly  believed  that  police  accident  reports  understate  
33:726:57681:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:(perhaps by a great margin) the number of crashes due to driver distraction (e.g., 
33:727:57764:27:28:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:NHTSA  (2009),  National  Safety  Council  (2013)).    We  re-estimate  the  baseline  
33:728:57851:28:28:108:511:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression  of  Table  2  using  the  number  of  distracted  driver  crashes  as  the  
33:729:57939:28:27:108:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent  variable.    The  results  of  this  regression  are  reported  in  the  fourth  
33:730:58031:27:28:107:511:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:column  of  Table  6.    The  coefficient  of  PokéStop100  x  Post  indicates  that  
33:731:58117:28:27:107:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:distracted driver crashes as given in the police reports increase disproportionately 
33:732:58202:27:0:107:515:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:in   the   vicinity   of   PokéStops   following   the   introduction   of   Pokémon   GO.      
34:733:58301:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:Although these results are based on a relatively small sample of crashes involving 
34:734:58384:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:(presumably)  self-reported  driver  distraction,  they  do  corroborate  a  link  between  
34:735:58476:28:27:108:418:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:PokéStop locations and crashes attributed to distracted drivers.   
34:736:58543:27:28:107:278:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.4. Other Confounding Events  
34:737:58574:28:28:143:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:A:On  November  15,  2012,  Niantic  launched  the  augmented  reality  game  
34:738:58650:28:27:107:506:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ingress.  The game was also location based, but was much less popular, even at its 
34:739:58733:27:28:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:peak of popularity, than Pokémon GO.  Nevertheless, many of the points of play 
34:740:58812:28:27:107:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  two  games  overlap.    It  is  possible  that  some  of  the  users  of  Pokémon  GO  
34:741:58908:27:28:107:506:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:were not new users of a location-based game.  If so, it is possible that some of the 
34:742:58993:28:28:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pokémon  GO  players  were  merely  substituting  one  game  for  the  other.    In  any  
34:743:59083:28:27:107:510:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:event,  our  estimates  of  the  incremental  effect  of  playing  Pokémon  GO  while  
34:744:59170:27:28:107:238:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving are still unbiased.   
34:745:59200:28:27:143:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:A:Further, on May 16, 2016, Niantic began field testing Pokémon GO in the 
34:746:59272:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S. Game-players could apply to enroll in the beta testing and begin playing the 
34:747:59354:28:27:107:506:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:game prior to its official launch.  To the extent that such activity increased crashes 
34:748:59441:27:28:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops prior to July 6, 2016, certain of our estimates of the 
34:749:59529:28:28:107:510:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:incremental  increase  in  crashes  due  to  introduction  of  the  game  would  be  
34:750:59614:28:27:107:508:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:downward  biased.    However,  the  tests  in  which  the  frequency  of  crashes  in  the  
34:751:59706:27:28:107:508:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:vicinity of PokéStops in the  week  or  month  after  the  introduction of the game is 
34:752:59793:28:27:108:507:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared with the frequency of crashes in the vicinity of PokéStops in the same 
34:753:59873:27:0:108:408:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:week or month of the prior year cannot suffer from this bias.   
35:754:59940:0:27:108:263:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.5.      Identifying Assumptions 
35:755:59974:27:28:144:506:645:144:Times:144:Times:A:The   results   in   the   paper   are   based   on   a   difference-in-differences 
35:756:60057:28:27:107:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:methodology.    A  clear  benefit  of  this  approach  is  its  simplicity  and,  thus,  
35:757:60146:27:28:107:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:transparency.    It  is,  however,  important  to  recognize  that  the  methodology  
35:758:60232:28:28:107:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:crucially  relies  on  two  assumptions:  (1)  the  exogeneity  of  the  timing  of  the  
35:759:60322:28:27:107:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  and  (2)  the  comparability  of  the  locations  in  the  
35:760:60412:27:28:107:478:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:proximity of PokéStops and of locations not in the proximity of PokéStops.   
35:761:60489:28:27:107:440:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.5.1.   Exogeneity of the Timing of the Introduction of Pokémon GO 
35:762:60556:27:28:143:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  number  of  tests  in  the  earlier  sections  validate  the  exogeneity  of  the  
35:763:60642:28:28:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:timing of the introduction of Pokémon GO.  Importantly, we show that the results 
35:764:60723:28:27:107:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  robust  to  using  a  short  time  interval  that  includes  a  sharp  discontinuity  
35:765:60814:27:28:107:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:represented  by  the  introduction  of  the  game.    We  also  document  that,  following  
35:766:60906:28:27:107:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:the introduction of the game, the magnitude of the results varied as the number of 
35:767:60989:27:28:107:511:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:players  changed  over  time.    Thus,  the  results  are  concentrated  around  the  
35:768:61075:28:27:107:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction  of  the  game  and  vary  depending  on  the  intensity  of  play.    These  
35:769:61166:27:28:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:results  support  the  presumption  that  the  date  of  the  introduction  of  the  game  is  
35:770:61261:28:28:107:170:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:exogenous.   
35:771:61274:28:27:107:296:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.5.2.   Comparability of the Locations 
35:772:61314:27:28:143:511:176:144:Times:144:Times:A:The   comparability   of   locations   in   the   proximity   of   PokéStops   and   
35:773:61399:28:27:107:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:locations not in the proximity of PokéStops relies on the assumption that, absent 
35:774:61481:27:0:107:507:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  introduction  of  the  game,  the  average  change  in  the  number  of  crashes  over  
36:775:61577:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:time would have been the same for the two sets of locations.  We refer to this as 
36:776:61659:27:28:107:262:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:the parallel trends assumption.   
36:777:61693:28:27:143:506:617:144:Times:144:Times:A:To test whether the data satisfy the parallel trends assumption, we estimate 
36:778:61770:27:28:107:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:a regression in which the dependent variable is the number of crashes per location 
36:779:61853:28:28:107:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:per  day.    The  key  independent  variables  are  interactions  between  PokéStop100  
36:780:61941:28:27:107:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:and an indicator for each month over the sample period excluding the months of 
36:781:62020:27:28:107:506:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:October and November 2015.  We exclude two months so as to have a benchmark 
36:782:62096:28:27:107:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  comparison.    We  exclude  October  and  November  2015  as  they  are  the  
36:783:62179:27:28:107:507:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:midpoint  of  the  pre-Pokémon  GO  time  period.    Further,  these  months  are  not  an  
36:784:62271:28:28:108:510:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:unreasonable  benchmark  because  the  difference  in  the  number  of  crashes  at  
36:785:62356:28:27:108:509:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:locations  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops  in  these  months  and  locations  not  in  the  
36:786:62450:27:28:108:511:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:vicinity   of   PokéStops   during   these   months  is  representative  of  the  typical  
36:787:62541:28:27:108:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference  during  the  pre-Pokémon  GO  period.    The  other  independent  variables  
36:788:62630:27:28:108:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  date  and  location  fixed  effects  and  the  interaction  between  University  Break  
36:789:62723:28:27:108:204:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:and PokéStop100.   
36:790:62742:27:28:144:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  parallel  trends  assumption  is  supported  if  the  coefficients  of  the  
36:791:62824:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:month and PokéStop100 interaction variables do not indicate a trend through time 
36:792:62905:28:27:108:509:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:prior  to  July  6,  2016.    Figure  1  is  a  plot  of  the  coefficients  by  month  over  the  
36:793:63004:27:28:108:509:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:entire  sample  period.    As  the  figure  shows,  there  is  no  trend  in  the  coefficients  
36:794:63101:28:27:108:506:148:144:Times:144:Times:B:over the months that precede the introduction of the game, thereby, supporting the 
36:795:63184:27:0:108:510:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:parallel  trends  assumption.    Equally  important,  the  figure  evidences  a  sharp  
37:796:63275:0:27:108:511:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:discontinuity  starting  the  month  of  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO.    The  
37:797:63360:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient of the interaction term is positive in each of the following months and 
37:798:63444:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically  significant  for  the  intervals  of  July  6,  2016,  through  July  31,  2016,  
37:799:63541:27:28:108:506:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the months of August and October.  In line with Table 2, the coefficient of the 
37:800:63625:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:interaction  term  declines  in  the  months  that  follow  the  introduction  of  the  game,  
37:801:63720:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:in line with the decline in the number of active players.  These results confirm the 
37:802:63805:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:connection between the introduction of the game and the increase in crashes in the 
37:803:63888:28:27:108:503:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:proximity  of  PokéStops.    These  results  validate  the  use  of  the  difference-in-
37:804:63976:27:28:108:233:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences methodology. 
37:805:64001:28:28:108:204:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:6.    Conclusion 
37:806:64018:28:27:144:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:Based on detailed police accident reports for Tippecanoe County, Indiana, 
37:807:64092:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:we determine that users playing the augmented reality game Pokémon GO while 
37:808:64168:28:27:108:507:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving gave rise to a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes, injuries, and 
37:809:64253:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:fatalities in the vicinity of PokéStops over the 148 days following the introduction 
37:810:64338:28:27:107:509:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  game.    In  total,  the  estimated  incremental  costs  associated  with  these  
37:811:64429:27:28:107:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:crashes range from $5.2 million to $25.5 million with the variability in the range 
37:812:64512:28:28:107:511:231:144:Times:144:Times:B:being  largely  attributable  to  the  value  assigned  to  the  two  incremental  lives  lost.    
37:813:64611:28:27:107:507:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:Regardless of how they are measured, the costs are significant, as are the implied 
37:814:64694:27:28:107:323:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases in vehicular insurance premiums.   
37:815:64739:28:27:143:512:148:144:Times:144:Times:A:Extrapolation   of   our   results   to   a   state-wide   or   nation-wide   total   is   
37:816:64830:27:0:108:508:121:144:Times:144:Times:B:speculative, and may be especially so given that the playing of games on mobile 
38:817:64913:0:27:108:510:672:144:Times:144:Times:B:phones while driving is legal in in the state of Indiana but not in all other states.  
38:818:65000:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:With  that  in  mind,  as  a  point  of  reference,  if  the  increases  in  crashes  associated  
38:819:65098:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:with Tippecanoe County are applied to the national totals, the increase in crashes 
38:820:65181:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributable  to  the  introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  is  145,632  with  an  associated  
38:821:65270:28:28:108:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  in  the  number  of  injuries  of  29,370  and  an  associated  increase  in  the  
38:822:65363:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of fatalities of 256 over the period of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 
38:823:65445:27:28:108:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:B:2016.18  The implied nation-wide economic cost of users playing the game while 
38:824:65524:28:27:107:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving in the vicinity of PokéStops ranges from $2 billion to $7.3 billion over the 
38:825:65609:27:28:108:507:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:148 days following introduction of the game with equally large implied increases 
38:826:65690:28:28:108:223:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:in insurance premiums. 
38:827:65713:28:27:144:511:396:144:Times:144:Times:A:Using  these  numbers  as  a  basis  for  policy  recommendations  is  tempting.    
38:828:65797:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:The immediate impulse is to recommend further  bans  on  the  use  of  smartphones  
38:829:65881:28:27:107:503:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:while  driving.    The  cautions  associated  with  such  a  recommendation  are  three-
38:830:65969:27:28:107:508:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:fold.    First,  in  response  to  concerns  about  potential  crashes  due  to  users  playing  
38:831:66066:28:27:108:510:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  game  while  driving,  in  an  update  of  the  game,  Niantic  added  a  pop  up  
38:832:66154:27:34:108:507:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:message saying “You’re going too fast! Pokémon GO should not be played while

38:834:66291:7:16:108:506:218:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 The increase in the number of crashes nation-wide, 145,632, is calculated as 6,296,000 crashes x 
38:835:66391:16:12:107:506:202:100:Times:100:Times:F:134/5,793, where 6,296,000 is the total number of vehicular crashes in the U.S. in 2015 (NHTSA, 
38:836:66487:12:11:107:507:190:100:Times:100:Times:F:2016),  134  is  the  number  of  incremental  crashes  attributable  to  Pokémon  GO  during  the  time  
38:837:66593:11:12:107:506:179:100:Times:100:Times:F:interval of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 2016 (from Table 2), and 5,793 is the county-wide

38:841:67002:11:12:108:508:133:100:Times:100:Times:F:computed  as  145,632  x  0.20167  persons  injured  per  crash  (from  Table  1).    The  increase  in  the

39:845:67318:27:28:108:506:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:rapidly moving vehicle.  A message further asks the player to confirm that she is a 
39:846:67402:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:B:passenger.    Thus,  in  an  effort  at  self-regulation,  the  game  cautions  users  against  
39:847:67498:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:playing  the  game  while  driving.    Second,  policy  recommendations  require  a  
39:848:67583:28:28:108:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:consideration of both costs and benefits and we have made no attempt to calculate 
39:849:67665:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  economic  benefits  of  using  mobile  devices  while  driving.    We  acknowledge,

53:1006:95085:28:28:72:545:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:introduction  of  Pokémon  GO  are  differently  affected  by  the  introduction  of  the  game.    The  
53:1007:95190:28:27:72:543:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:underlying premise is that the number of crashes prior to the introduction of the game is a proxy 
53:1008:95288:27:28:72:542:313:144:Times:144:Times:A:for the level of traffic.19  If the alternative explanation is correct, the coefficient of the interaction 
53:1009:95395:28:27:72:546:285:144:Times:144:Times:A:of No. of Crashes at Location L before Pokémon GO with Post would be statistically significant.  
53:1010:95492:27:28:72:543:258:144:Times:144:Times:A:As shown in the first column of Table A1, it is not.  Additionally, the key interaction of interest, 
53:1011:95593:28:28:72:543:230:144:Times:144:Times:A:PokéStop100 x Post, is, as before, positive and statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).  These 
53:1012:95693:28:27:72:364:202:144:Times:144:Times:A:results are also inconsistent with the alternative explanation.

53:1014:95808:28:27:108:544:147:144:Times:144:Times:B:Another  possibility  is  that  some  crashes  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops  are  attributable  to  
53:1015:95912:27:34:72:544:120:144:Times:144:Times:A:distraction  associated  with  the  game,  but  it  is  a  passenger  rather  than  the  driver  who  is  playing

53:1017:96087:8:0:72:467:78:42:Times:100:Times:A:19 Ideally, of course, we would use actual traffic levels.  Unfortunately such data are not available.

54:1019:96304:27:28:72:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:reports indicate that the vehicle of the driver causing the crash had more than one occupant. We 
54:1020:96401:28:27:72:544:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:then re-estimate the baseline regression.  The results are reported in the second column of Table 
54:1021:96499:27:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:A1.  The coefficient of PokéStop100 x Post is 0.00087 with a p-value of 0.001 implying that 120 
54:1022:96595:28:28:72:545:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:of  the  134  incremental  crashes  are  certainly  not  due  to  a  passenger  playing  the  game  (i.e.,

54:1026:96875:27:28:108:547:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  units  of  analysis  in  the  tests  in  the  paper  are  the  geographic  locations  that  
54:1027:96972:28:28:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:experienced at least one crash during March 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016.  We impose 
54:1028:97063:28:27:72:544:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:no  requirement  as  to  whether  the  crashes  occurred  prior  to  or  subsequent  to  the  introduction  of  
54:1029:97175:27:28:71:544:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Pokémon  GO.    The  sample  is  nevertheless  censored  in  that  locations  that  did  not  experience  
54:1030:97281:28:27:71:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:crashes are not included.  Mathematically, there is an infinity of such locations, e.g., points in a 
54:1031:97382:27:28:71:104:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:road.   
54:1032:97390:28:27:107:544:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  this  section,  we  address  the  concern  that  such  censoring  may  introduce  a  bias  in  our  
54:1033:97494:27:28:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:estimation.  We address this concern by identifying locations in an alternative way.  Specifically, 
54:1034:97594:28:28:71:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:we conduct the tests using street intersections in Tippecanoe County as the unit of analysis.  We 
54:1035:97692:28:27:71:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:identify 4,745 intersections from OpenStreetMap.  Importantly, as we noted earlier, the majority 
54:1036:97789:27:28:71:416:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:of these intersections experienced no crashes during the sample period.

55:1045:98721:28:28:72:312:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:experienced no crashes during the sample period. 
55:1046:98770:28:27:108:543:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  unit  of  observation  is  each  intersection/date  pair  of  which  there  are  3,041,545.    We  
55:1047:98874:27:28:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:use  these  data  to  address  questions  of  whether  the  frequency  and  severity  of  crashes  increased  
55:1048:98984:28:27:72:545:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:disproportionately  at  intersections  in  the  vicinity  of  PokéStops  following  the  introduction  of

55:1050:99197:28:28:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:increased from 0.005989 before to 0.007667 after the introduction of the game.  In comparison, 
55:1051:99292:28:27:72:543:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:at intersections that are not in the vicinity of PokéStops, the number of crashes per day increased 
55:1052:99392:27:28:72:216:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:from 0.002015 to 0.002155.

55:1057:99849:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:contrary to the concern that the coefficients in the regressions based on geographic locations are 
55:1058:99948:28:27:72:547:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:inflated  due  to  censoring  of  locations,  in  all  four  regressions  reported  in  Table  A2,  the  
55:1059:100053:27:28:71:374:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:coefficients are larger than their equivalents in Tables 2 and 4.
