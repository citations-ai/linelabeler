2:26:1209:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:27:1217:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we make two contributions to the literature
2:28:1315:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:on end-of-life transfers. First, we show that unequal bequests are much more common than generally
2:29:1413:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:recognized, with one-third of parents with wills planning to divide their estates unequally among their
2:30:1516:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:children. These plans for unequal division are particularly concentrated in complex families, which
2:31:1615:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:are of two types: families with stepchildren and families with genetic children with whom the parent
2:32:1715:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:has had no contact, e.g., children from previous marriages. We find that in complex families past and
2:33:1816:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:current contact between parents and children reduces or eliminates unequal bequests. Second, although
2:34:1917:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the literature focuses on the bequest intentions of parents who have made wills, we find that many
2:35:2015:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:older Americans have not made wills. Although the probability of having a will increases with age,
2:36:2113:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:30 percent of HRS respondents aged 70 and over have no wills. Of HRS respondents who died between
2:37:2210:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:1995 and 2010, 38 percent died without wills. Thus, focusing exclusively on the bequest intentions
2:38:2308:14:14:72:539:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of parents who have made wills may provide an incomplete and misleading picture of end-of-life
2:39:2402:14:42:72:116:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:transfers.

3:62:2904:0:26:70:179:759:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1.  Introduction
3:63:2920:26:18:70:524:733:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper we shed new light on bequest behavior using a large and nationally rep-
3:64:3005:18:18:70:524:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resentative  US  sample  drawn  from  the  Health  and  Retirement  Study  (HRS)  over  the
3:65:3096:18:18:70:524:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period 1995–2010.  A distinguishing feature of our work is its focus on complex families,
3:66:3185:18:18:70:524:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in particular on parents with stepchildren and parents with genetic children with whom
3:67:3271:18:18:70:524:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they have limited or no contact (e.g., children from previous marriages).  We complement
3:68:3359:18:19:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our analysis of the bequest intentions of parents with wills by examining actual bequests
3:69:3448:19:18:70:524:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using reports about the disposition of the estates of HRS respondents who died between
3:70:3534:18:18:70:524:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one HRS wave and the next.  We find that unequal bequests (both intended and actual)
3:71:3618:18:18:70:524:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  much  more  prevalent  than  previously  documented,  with  one-third  of  parents  with
3:72:3711:18:18:70:524:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wills planning to distribute their estates unequally.  Unequal intended bequests are most
3:73:3800:18:18:70:524:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common in complex families, but contact between parents and children reduces or elimi-
3:74:3886:18:18:70:524:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nates unequal bequests.  Finally, we find that a substantial fraction of older parents report
3:75:3979:18:18:70:507:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:having no wills and a substantial fraction of HRS respondents who died had no wills.
3:76:4063:18:18:88:524:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Empirical research has long established that a substantial majority of parents divide,
3:77:4149:18:18:70:524:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or intend to divide, their estates equally among their children (Menchik 1980; Wilhelm
3:78:4235:18:18:70:524:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1996;  McGarry  1999;  Cox  2003;  Light  and  McGarry  2004;  Behrman  and  Rosenzweig
3:79:4322:18:18:70:524:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2004).  Despite the fact that earlier economic models predicted unequal bequests (e.g.,
3:80:4409:18:18:70:524:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Becker 1974; Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers 1985; Cox 1987), more recent studies have
3:81:4495:18:18:70:524:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developed theories that attempt to rationalize the prevalence of equal bequests, sometimes
3:82:4585:18:18:70:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also attempting to explain why parents treat their children unequally with respect to inter
3:83:4676:18:18:70:524:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vivos transfers but equally with respect to bequests (e.g., Andreoni 1989; Bernheim and
3:84:4763:18:18:70:154:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Severinov 2003).
3:85:4779:18:19:88:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The proportion of American parents aged 50 and over who reported having wills,1in
3:86:4860:19:18:70:524:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which their children were treated unequally more than doubled between 1995 and 2010,
3:87:4944:18:18:70:524:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rising from 16 percent to almost 35 percent (Figure 1).2This upward trend, which holds
3:88:5030:18:18:70:523:281:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:for both mothers and fathers, is not simply driven by the ageing of the HRS respondents.3
3:89:5119:18:18:70:524:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A similar increase can be observed across several cohorts of Americans born since 1890
3:90:5205:18:18:70:524:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Figure 2).  Younger cohorts (i.e., those born in 1960 or after) are substantially more likely
3:91:5299:18:18:70:524:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to intend unequal bequests, with the sharpest increases occurring among individuals who
3:92:5386:18:18:70:523:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are no longer married:  widows, widowers, and divorced individuals (Figure 3).4Bequests,
3:93:5474:18:16:84:524:191:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1We focus on the bequest intentions of parents with wills because most of the information on bequest
3:94:5574:16:12:70:524:175:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:intentions collected by HRS is from parents who report that they have wills.  See the data description in
3:95:5679:12:8:70:136:163:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:subsection 3.B.
3:96:5694:8:16:84:524:155:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2Throughout the paper, stepchildren are counted as “children”. Moreover, although the legal definition
3:97:5796:16:12:70:524:139:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of stepchildren is narrow (i.e., a stepchild is the child of a spouse), we use this term broadly, to include
3:98:5904:12:8:70:448:127:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the children of a cohabiting partner as well as the children of a legally married spouse.
3:99:5993:8:16:84:524:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:3Between 1998 and 2010 the average age of the HRS sample increased only by four years.  This is due
3:100:6092:16:12:70:524:103:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:to a number of factors, including attrition, death of older respondents and, since 2004, the introduction
3:101:6197:12:8:70:260:91:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of new cohorts of individuals aged 51 to 56.
3:102:6241:8:0:84:460:83:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:4HRS data do not allow us to distinguish between cohabitors and married individuals.
4:103:6326:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, bear a strong relationship to demographics:  as demographics are changing so
4:104:6413:18:19:70:136:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are bequests.
4:105:6426:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Since the middle of the 1990s the fraction of parents reporting unequal bequest inten-
4:106:6512:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions has consistently been 30–35 percentage points higher among parents with stepchil-
4:107:6599:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren than among those with genetic children only (Figure 4).  Comparing parents who
4:108:6682:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have had no contact with at least one of their genetic children with parents who have had
4:109:6771:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at least some contact with all of their genetic children,  we find the no-contact parents
4:110:6860:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about 35–45 percentage points less likely to intend equal bequests.5The trends in unequal
4:111:6949:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequest intentions among parents without contact with their children is the same as the
4:112:7036:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trend observed among parents with stepchildren.  As the proportion of complex families
4:113:7122:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has  risen  in  the  last  twenty  years,  so  has  the  proportion  of  parents  who  plan  unequal
4:114:7222:18:18:70:117:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequests.
4:115:7231:18:18:88:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When  individuals  die  without  a  valid  will,  the  intestacy  laws  of  their  state  provide
4:116:7328:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the default allocation,  dividing the decedent’s estate between the surviving spouse and
4:117:7416:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the children.6After providing an often very substantial share for the surviving spouse,
4:118:7503:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intestacy  laws  divide  the  remainder  equally  among  the  decedent’s  genetic  and  legally
4:119:7598:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adopted  children.   Unlike  surviving  spouses,  under  intestacy  laws  surviving  cohabiting
4:120:7693:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:partners inherit nothing. And, unlike genetic and legally adopted children, under intestacy
4:121:7784:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:laws  stepchildren  inherit  nothing  (Fried  1992;  Brashier  2004;  Friedman  2009;  Reid,  de
4:122:7880:19:18:70:229:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Waal, and Zimmermann 2011).
4:123:7907:18:18:88:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Since 1998 the average fraction of HRS respondents without a will has been around 42
4:124:7991:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent (Figure 5).7Among respondents with stepchildren the average fraction without
4:125:8075:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wills is somewhat greater (49 percent),  and it is even greater among parents who have
4:126:8161:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no contact with their genetic children (58 percent).  Parents aged less than 70 are much
4:127:8249:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less likely to have wills, perhaps because writing a will is not yet salient for them, but a
4:128:8341:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:staggering 30 percent of parents aged 70 and over report not having wills.  The data also
4:129:8430:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reveal a slight education gradient (not shown):  HRS respondents with university degrees
4:130:8518:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or higher qualifications are more likely to have a will as opposed to their less educated
4:131:8607:18:18:70:137:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:counterparts.
4:132:8620:18:18:88:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Standard economic models ignore complex families.  The (usually implicit) assumption
4:133:8704:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that all children are born to a married couple who remain married to each other.  When
4:134:8793:18:19:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one  spouse  dies,  the  surviving  spouse  is  (usually  implicitly)  assumed  not  to  remarry.
4:135:8890:19:15:84:524:180:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5In 1995 the HRS did not ask the question on parent-child contact, while in 2010 the question was
4:136:8987:15:12:70:524:165:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:asked only to a small fraction of respondents.  For these reasons we do not show those two years in Figure
4:137:9093:12:9:70:78:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:4.
4:138:9095:9:15:84:524:144:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6As Rosenbury (2005) shows, there are important differences in intestacy laws across states, but we
4:139:9194:15:8:70:282:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:focus on features that are common across states.
4:140:9242:8:16:84:524:121:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7This figure starts in 1998 because the 1995 HRS wave oversampled older people (with an average age
4:141:9341:16:12:70:524:105:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of 78 years), while the 1996 wave oversampled younger individuals, whose average age is 59 years.  From
4:142:9444:12:12:70:524:93:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1998 onwards, the study comprised both subsamples, and in that year individuals were on average aged
4:143:9544:12:0:70:83:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:67.
5:144:9548:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Little  is  said  about  divorce,  remarriage  or  repartnering  and  even  less  about  multiple
5:145:9645:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:partner fertility.8By ignoring divorce,  repartnering,  or remarriage,  canonical economic
5:146:9735:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models fail to recognize the increased complexity of the family (Bumpass and Lu 2000;
5:147:9820:18:18:70:394:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Stevenson and Wolfers 2007; Lundberg and Pollak 2014, 2015).
5:148:9880:18:18:88:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to presenting a representative picture of contemporary end-of-life transfers,
5:149:9969:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we make two contributions to the literature.  First, we show that unequal bequests are
5:150:10055:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much  more  common  than  generally  recognized.   Unequal  bequests  are  concentrated  in
5:151:10146:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complex families, that is, families in which parents have stepchildren and families with
5:152:10234:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic children with whom the parent has had no contact (e.g., children from previous
5:153:10320:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marriages).  Parents with stepchildren are much less likely to include all children in their
5:154:10412:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wills  than  parents  without  stepchildren,  and  parents  with  stepchildren  who  have  wills
5:155:10508:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are substantially less likely to plan equal bequests.  Similarly, parents who have had no
5:156:10597:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact with one or more of their genetic children are less likely to include all of their
5:157:10687:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children in their wills.  When all children are included in the parent’s will, we find that
5:158:10778:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents with no-contact children are less likely to plan equal bequests.  The likelihood of
5:159:10869:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unequal bequests, however, is reduced and often entirely eliminated by longer coresidence
5:160:10958:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of stepparents and stepchildren.  We interpret this finding as reflecting the accumulation
5:161:11048:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of family-specific capital (e.g., trust and affection) that triggers norms of equal treatment.
5:162:11142:18:19:88:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our second contribution to the literature on end-of-life transfers shifts the focus from
5:163:11230:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals with wills to those who die intestate (i.e., without wills).  We find that many
5:164:11321:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:older  Americans  do  not  have  wills.   More  specifically,  40  percent  of  HRS  respondents
5:165:11417:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:report not having wills and 30 percent of HRS respondents aged 70 and over report not
5:166:11502:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:having wills.  Of HRS respondents who died, 38 percent died intestate.  Hence, the usual
5:167:11590:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focus on bequest intentions provides an incomplete and misleading picture of end-of-life
5:168:11678:18:18:70:117:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfers.
5:169:11688:18:18:88:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews previous work on bequests and
5:170:11771:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describes the legal environment in which individuals make end-of-life transfers.  The data
5:171:11861:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are described in Section 3, where we also present the statistical methods we use in our
5:172:11948:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis.  Section 4 presents the benchmark results of our empirical analysis of bequest
5:173:12036:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intentions,  while  Section  5  shows  further  empirical  results,  which  include  instrumental
5:174:12133:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables estimates, and the analysis of changes in bequest intentions and of the actual
5:175:12221:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:division  of  estates.   Section  6  provides  a  simple  conceptual  framework  for  interpreting
5:176:12319:18:16:70:280:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:end-of-life transfers.  Section 7 concludes.
5:177:12363:16:15:84:524:165:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:8In a traditional nuclear family all the children in the household are joint children, but one or both
5:178:12465:15:0:70:379:150:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:parents may have children from previous partnerships living elsewhere.

6:180:12573:26:18:70:524:733:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Almost all economic models predict unequal bequests.9For example, the altruist model
6:181:12657:18:18:70:524:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumes that parents equalize marginal utilities across children (Barro 1974; Becker 1974;
6:182:12747:18:18:70:524:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Becker  and  Tomes  1979;  Tomes  1981).   This  assumption,  together  with  some  strong
6:183:12837:18:18:70:524:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions about preferences and inter vivos transfers, implies that parents will bequeath
6:184:12928:18:18:70:524:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more  to  their  less  well-off  children.   Exchange  models  assume  that  bequests  are  made
6:185:13024:18:19:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  children  in  return  for  their  services  such  as  attention  and  care  (Bernheim,  Shleifer,
6:186:13125:19:18:70:524:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Summers  1985;  Cox  1987;  Cox  and  Rank  1992).   Because  children  face  different
6:187:13217:18:18:70:524:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity costs of providing these services, exchange models predict that children will
6:188:13306:18:18:70:444:588:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:provide different amounts of services and will receive unequal bequests.10
6:189:13380:18:18:88:524:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although both the altruist model and exchange models have some empirical support
6:190:13460:18:18:70:524:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Tomes  1988,  Cox  and  Rank  1992;  Laitner  and  Ohlsson  2001),  most  empirical  studies
6:191:13553:18:18:70:524:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:challenge both classes of models finding that an overwhelming majority of parents divide
6:192:13641:18:18:70:524:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their estates equally among their children (Menchik 1980, 1988; Wilhelm 1996; McGarry
6:193:13726:18:18:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1999;  Light  and  McGarry  2004;  Behrman  and  Rosenzweig  2004;  Erixson  and  Ohlsson
6:194:13815:18:18:70:524:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2015).11Significant  effort  has  then  been  devoted  to  rationalizing  equal  bequests.   For
6:195:13911:18:18:70:524:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instance, Bernheim and Severinov (2003) propose a model of intergenerational transfers
6:196:13997:18:18:70:524:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based  on  the  assumption  that  each  child’s  perception  of  parental  affection  influences
6:197:14093:18:18:70:524:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:his or her subjective well-being.  Children cannot directly observe parental preferences,
6:198:14182:18:18:70:524:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but parents signal affection through their actions, including bequests.  Altruistic parents
6:199:14273:18:18:70:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then must consider the possibility that unequal bequests may lead their children to infer
6:200:14362:18:18:70:524:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  they  are  loved  either  more  or  less  than  their  siblings.   The  assumption  that  the
6:201:14461:18:18:70:524:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:division  of  inter  vivos  gifts  is  not  observed  by  all  the  children,  whereas  the  division  of
6:202:14566:18:19:70:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequests (or the division implied by bequest intentions) is observed,  remains untested.
6:203:14654:19:18:70:524:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Nor is it clear whether and how parents’ stated bequest intentions affect children’s actions
6:204:14746:18:18:70:524:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g.,  caregiving) regarding the parents.  Equal division is also consistent with parents’
6:205:14837:18:18:70:524:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indifference over how their estates are divided among their children.  But indifference is
6:206:14927:18:18:70:524:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both implausible and theoretically unsatisfying because it is compatible with all possible
6:207:15017:18:18:70:167:245:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:division patterns.12

6:209:15124:18:15:84:524:209:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:9Comprehensive  reviews  of  the  extensive  economics  literature  on  bequests  are  given  by  Behrman
6:210:15229:15:12:70:524:194:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(1997),  Laitner  (1997),  Laferr`ere  and  Wolff  (2006),  and  McGarry  (2008,  2013).   For  an  introduction

6:212:15440:12:8:70:349:170:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:treatment of the legal issues, see Dukeminier and Sitkoff (2013).
6:213:15505:8:16:80:524:162:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10Bargaining power and bargaining ability will also play a role in the absence of special assumptions
6:214:15606:16:8:70:378:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(e.g., that parents can make take-it-or-leave-it offers to their children.)
6:215:15681:8:16:80:524:138:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11Wilhelm  (1996),  which  use  federal  estate  tax  data,  does  allow  for  adopted  children  but  not  for
6:216:15792:16:12:70:524:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:stepchildren and assumes that parents have equal (symmetric) concern for all their children.  To the best
6:217:15897:12:8:70:494:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of our knowledge, all bequest models driven by altruism or exchange motives ignore stepchildren.
6:218:15993:8:16:80:524:102:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12Pollak (1988) argues that the credibility of the parents’ threat to disinherit a child in the strategic
6:219:16098:16:12:70:524:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:bequest  model  of  Bernheim,  Shleifer,  and  Summers  (1985)  crucially  depends  on  the  assumption  that
6:220:16207:12:0:70:413:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:parents are indifferent over how their estates are divided among their children.
7:221:16288:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are still largely untested (Cox 2003, 2007).  The underlying premise is that parents behave
7:222:16379:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so as to maximize the probability of survival of their genes and that children with greater
7:223:16470:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth are more likely to pass on their genes.  One implication is what we call the “genetic-
7:224:16563:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:child hypothesis” — that is, parents will make end-of-life transfers to their genetic children
7:225:16657:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than to their social children (i.e., genetically unrelated children such as stepchildren
7:226:16752:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who live in the same household).13We consider the implications of this hypothesis in two
7:227:16840:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases: stepchildren and genetic children with whom the decedent has had no contact (e.g.,
7:228:16929:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children from a previous marriage who were very young when the parents divorced).  The
7:229:17015:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic child hypothesis makes clear predictions in both of these cases.  Decedents will
7:230:17103:18:18:70:219:596:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:favor their genetic children.14

7:235:17503:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vast  majority  of  mothers  (more  than  92  percent)  intend  to  leave  equal  bequests.   The
7:236:17600:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mothers  who  said  they  intended  to  leave  unequal  bequests  were  asked  to  explain  why.
7:237:17696:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Some  responded  with  explanations  that  were  consistent  with  altruism,  others  with  ex-
7:238:17791:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change and,  among mothers with stepchildren,  some with explanations consistent with
7:239:17876:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the genetic-child hypothesis.  Light and McGarry find that greater within-family variation
7:240:17966:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in children’s incomes (a proxy for altruism), poor maternal health (a proxy for exchange),
7:241:18056:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the presence of stepchildren (a proxy for the genetic-child motive) are associated with
7:242:18147:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher probabilities of unequal intended bequests.  More specifically, for mothers with at
7:243:18237:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least one genetic child and at least one stepchild, they find that the probability of unequal
7:244:18330:18:18:70:455:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intended bequests increases from 7.9 to 11.3 percent, a 43 percent increase.

7:248:18660:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rently caregivers are 32 percentage points more likely than their noncaregiving siblings
7:249:18748:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be included in their parents’ life insurance policies, while expected caregivers are three

7:251:18940:18:16:80:524:217:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:13Unlike models based on altruism or exchange, which hinge on actions taken individually by parents
7:252:19039:16:11:70:524:201:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and children (such as the child’s need for support or the frequency of visits to and other contacts with older
7:253:19149:11:12:70:524:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:parents), the genetic-child hypothesis relies on one specific trait – the genetic link between decedents and
7:254:19257:12:12:70:524:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:potential beneficiaries.  In this respect, the genetic-child hypothesis is similar to models of intrahousehold
7:255:19367:12:12:70:524:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:allocation that emphasize a single (exogenous) attribute,  such as birth order (Behrman and Taubman
7:256:19466:12:12:70:524:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1986; Chu 1991) or the child’s sex (Behrman, Pollak and Taubman 1986).  Although these other single-
7:257:19566:12:12:70:524:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:attribute models may be useful for understanding differential inter vivos transfers or bequests related to
7:258:19672:12:12:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:birth order or sex, they cannot explain unequal bequests or bequest intentions toward genetic and social
7:259:19776:12:9:70:107:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:children.
7:260:19785:9:15:80:524:109:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:14Evolutionary reasoning also speaks to the distribution of bequests among genetic children and, when
7:261:19886:15:12:70:524:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:it does, it seldom predicts equal bequests.  For example, a childless post-menopausal daughter would not
7:262:19990:12:0:70:476:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:be predicted to receive bequests.  These accounts however are outside the scope of our paper.

8:265:20246:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:documented in divorced families.  Analyzing the effects of parental marital disruption on
8:266:20335:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:late-life inter vivos transfers, Pezzin and Schone (1999) find that parents (especially older
8:267:20428:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:men) engage in substantially lower levels of transfers with stepchildren than with their
8:268:20516:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic children.  Marital disruption is also central in Pezzin, Pollak, and Schone (2008).
8:269:20607:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:That  study,  however,  concentrates  on  “upstream  transfers”  (i.e.,  adult  children’s  time
8:270:20703:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and cash transfers to their parents) rather than on “downstream transfers” (i.e., transfers
8:271:20794:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of time and cash from parents to their children).  They find unequal flows of services to
8:272:20883:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unpartnered disabled parents in families that experience divorce, with stepchildren pro-
8:273:20971:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:viding significantly lower transfers than genetic children.  Other than Light and McGarry
8:274:21060:18:18:70:453:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2004), however, no previous study has examined bequests to stepchildren.
8:275:21133:18:18:88:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:End-of-life transfers and bequests have also been analyzed by legal scholars and com-
8:276:21218:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentators.  Unequal division of estates among genetic children typically generates unease
8:277:21307:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:among  trust  and  estates  lawyers  because  they  view  unequal  bequests  as  invitations  to
8:278:21403:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:litigation (Collins 2000; Blattmachr 2008; American Bar Association 2013).  Stepchildren,
8:279:21492:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however,  belong  to  a  different  category  since  the  law  treats  stepchildren  as  unrelated
8:280:21590:18:18:70:452:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strangers rather than as family members (Schanzenbach and Sitkoff 2009).
8:281:21662:18:19:88:531:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Legal scholars also write on intestacy, a subject thus far entirely neglected by economists.

8:284:21930:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dies without a valid will,  stepchildren inherit nothing.16As a number of scholars have
8:285:22017:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pointed out, stepchildren have never fared well under intestacy statutes (Mahoney 1989;
8:286:22104:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Gary 2000; Noble 2002; Brashier 2004; Cremer 2011).  Stepchildren however may inherit
8:287:22189:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from their absent biological parent, and so it is unclear whether they are disadvantaged by
8:288:22280:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intestacy law.17This issue cannot be explored with the HRS data and requires additional
8:289:22367:18:18:70:115:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research.
8:290:22376:18:18:88:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Some stepparents may intentionally forego writing a will precisely because they know
8:291:22460:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  intestacy  laws  will  mandate  an  equal  division  among  their  genetic  and  adopted
8:292:22554:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children and give nothing to their stepchildren.  On the other hand, parents with genetic
8:293:22643:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children  with  whom  they  have  had  no  contact  might  write  wills  to  avoid  giving  these
8:294:22740:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children an equal share of their estates.  Some parents are no doubt aware of the default
8:295:22829:18:16:80:524:181:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:15The Uniform Probate Code treats adopted children as if they were genetic children of the decedent

8:297:22952:8:16:80:524:157:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:16California provides a narrow exception to this generalization:  a stepchild may inherit if it can be

8:299:23155:11:12:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:barrier.  This exception is available only to a stepchild who satisfies the legal definition of a stepchild
8:300:23262:12:12:70:524:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(i.e., a child of the decedent’s spouse, not of the decedent’s cohabiting partner).  See Hanson (1995) and

8:302:23398:9:15:80:524:97:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:17At common law, in fact, the relationship of stepparent and stepchild generally confers no rights and

9:328:25486:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:report having both genetic children and stepchildren.20Of these individuals, 2,342 report
9:329:25575:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:having a will (about 18 percent of the sample of parents with wills or over 46 percent of
9:330:25664:18:19:70:228:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the parents with stepchildren).
9:331:25695:19:18:88:524:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The HRS also collects information on the frequency of contacts between parents and
9:332:25777:18:18:70:524:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children.  We use this information for the 12,739 individuals who have genetic children
9:333:25864:18:18:70:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only and report the frequency of contacts with their children and their bequest intentions.
9:334:25955:18:18:70:524:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Almost 14 percent of them (1,764 parents) report having had no contact with at least one
9:335:26043:18:18:70:524:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of their genetic children for at least one year during the survey period.  On average 6.6
9:336:26132:18:15:80:524:144:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:18As noted in the Introduction, HRS asks respondents about their bequest intentions only if they report
9:337:26235:15:12:70:524:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:having wills or trusts.  We do not distinguish between wills and trusts, because trusts are not common in
9:338:26340:12:12:70:524:117:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the HRS sample:  only 1.1 percent of the respondents report having a trust but not a will and 1.4 percent
9:339:26445:12:8:70:235:105:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:report having both a will and a trust.

9:341:26557:12:0:80:428:85:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:20The HRS does not distinguish between genetic children and adopted children.
10:342:26635:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of parents report having no contact in the previous year with at least one of their
10:343:26726:18:19:70:523:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children.21Among no-contact parents, the proportion without a will exceeds 57 percent.
10:344:26812:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is substantially greater than that observed among parents who have more frequent
10:345:26897:18:18:70:332:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact with all their genetic children (43 percent).
10:346:26950:18:18:88:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The exit files provide information on the actual disposition of estates and other basic
10:347:27037:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables  for  7,416  individuals  (almost  85  percent)  of  the  8,800  HRS  respondents  who
10:348:27133:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:died over the sample period.  There are 2,781 parents (38 percent) who died intestate, a
10:349:27221:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slightly smaller proportion than the 42 percent of HRS respondents in the core files who
10:350:27309:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:report having no wills.  Of the remaining 4,635 who died with a will, 3,897 had more than
10:351:27398:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one child and 630 (18 percent of the sample of decedents with wills and with more than
10:352:27484:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one child) had both stepchildren and genetic children, representing more than 90 percent
10:353:27572:18:35:70:237:560:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of decedents with stepchildren.22
10:354:27605:35:26:70:146:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B. Outcomes
10:355:27616:26:18:70:524:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 1 shows the means of our main dependent variables broken down by the presence
10:356:27699:18:18:70:524:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of stepchildren in both the core and the exit files and by parents’ marital status.  About
10:357:27789:18:18:70:524:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:42  percent  of  the  sample  in  the  core  files  does  not  have  a  will  (column  (a)).   The  raw
10:358:27892:18:18:70:524:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference  of  6.9  percentage  points  between  those  with  stepchildren  (column  (b))  and
10:359:27987:18:18:70:524:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those  with  genetic  children  only  (column  (c))  is  statistically  significant.   Almost  two-
10:360:28086:18:18:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thirds of divorced parents do not have a will.  Again, parents with stepchildren are less
10:361:28175:18:18:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to have a will than parents with genetic children only.  The same picture emerges
10:362:28263:18:18:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from  the  exit  files,  even  though  the  fraction  of  all  parents  without  a  will  is  almost  38
10:363:28367:18:18:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent, somewhat less than in the core files.  We shall return to this issue in the next
10:364:28456:18:18:70:108:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:section.
10:365:28464:18:18:88:524:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Conditional on having a will, about three-quarters of the parents from the core files
10:366:28549:18:18:70:524:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:report they include all children in their wills, while only 59 percent of the estates whose
10:367:28640:18:18:70:524:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributions are reported in the exit files were divided in a way that included all chil-
10:368:28730:18:18:70:524:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren.23Intended inclusion of all children is substantially less likely among parents with
10:369:28819:18:18:70:524:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchildren regardless of their marital status, but this does not emerge in the exit files,
10:370:28911:18:16:80:524:229:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:21Among parents with both stepchildren and genetic children, the proportion of parents with no contact
10:371:29013:16:8:70:318:213:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:with at least one of their children is higher, around 28%.
10:372:29071:8:16:80:524:205:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:22The exit files necessarily yield a sample that is smaller than that obtained from the core files.  More-
10:373:29177:16:12:70:524:189:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:over, at present, the exit files disproportionally represent individuals with lower socioeconomic status and
10:374:29285:12:8:70:255:177:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:higher mortality risks (Cutler et al.  2011).
10:375:29330:8:16:80:524:169:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:23As  already  mentioned,  most  of  the  information  available  in  the  HRS  is  on  bequest  intentions  of
10:376:29441:16:12:70:524:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:parents who report that they have a will.  The exception is in relation to the probability that respondents
10:377:29548:12:12:70:524:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:bequeath a specific amount of money (expressed in given categories), which is asked to each household
10:378:29649:12:11:70:524:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:independently of whether respondents have a will or not.  At the end of subsection 4.B we discuss the
10:379:29750:11:12:70:524:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:results  found  using  that  information.   We  should  stress  that  this  information  is  not  about  the  exact
10:380:29865:12:12:70:524:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:monetary  value  of  resources  that  parents  intend  to  transfer  to  their  children.   Rather,  it  is  about  the
10:381:29984:12:12:70:524:94:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:F:probabilitythat a parent leaves a bequest worth a given amount of money.  We therefore cannot determine
10:382:30087:12:0:70:369:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:how much each child will inherit in case his/her parents write a will.
11:383:30158:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where none of the differences are statistically significant at conventional levels (column
11:384:30248:18:19:70:140:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(d), panel B).
11:385:30262:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the core files, almost one-third of all parents with a will report that they plan to
11:386:30349:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribute their estate unequally among their children (column (a),  panel  C).  Intended
11:387:30438:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unequal divisions are much more likely among parents with stepchildren (61 percent for all
11:388:30528:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents and a staggering 75 percent for divorced parents, column (b)) than among parents
11:389:30616:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with genetic children only (27 and 29 percent respectively, column (c)).  In the exit files,
11:390:30708:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however,  the  proportion  of  estates  that  are  divided  unequally  is  substantially  greater
11:391:30805:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(53 percent).  The difference between parents with stepchildren and parents with genetic
11:392:30893:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children  only  is  smaller  than  that  observed  in  the  core  files,  but  is  always  statistically
11:393:30997:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant.  This may reflect a change in parents’ behavior between the time they reported
11:394:31088:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their intentions in the core files and the actual distribution of their estates reported in the
11:395:31183:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exit files.  It may also be driven by selection (parents in the exit files are older) or reflect
11:396:31279:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the difference in mortality rates by socioeconomic status (parents in the exit files are less
11:397:31372:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:educated and less healthy, and these might be the type of parents who are more likely to
11:398:31460:18:18:70:313:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribute unequally their end-of-life resources).
11:399:31510:18:18:88:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Table A1 mirrors Table 1 focusing on no-contact parents.  As in the case of
11:400:31594:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents with stepchildren, parents who have had no contact with their genetic children
11:401:31680:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the past year are much more likely not to have a will.  About 59 percent of no-contact
11:402:31769:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents have no will, as opposed to 44 percent of parents who have regular contact with
11:403:31856:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all their genetic children (panel A). Among divorced no-contact parents the proportion
11:404:31942:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  those  without  a  will  is  70  percent.   Looking  only  at  parents  with  a  will,  almost  84
11:405:32044:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of those with regular contacts with all their genetic children report the intention
11:406:32135:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to include all of them in the will.  This proportion is 27 percentage points greater than
11:407:32224:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that observed among no-contact parents,  and the difference is highly significant (panel
11:408:32312:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:B). Finally, parents in regular contact with their children also report they are more likely
11:409:32404:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than no-contact parents to divide their estates equally (77 and 47 percent, respectively).
11:410:32494:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The difference between these two groups of parents is even greater when we consider those
11:411:32583:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who divorced or widowed (panel C). These patterns are consistent with the predictions
11:412:32668:18:35:70:217:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implied by exchange models.

11:414:32743:26:18:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 2 reports summary statistics for the explanatory variables we use to model the prob-
11:415:32833:18:18:70:524:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abilities of reporting having a will and reporting the intention to leave unequal bequests.
11:416:32924:18:18:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We show figures for the sample of parents who report having wills (column (b)) and for
11:417:33010:18:18:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the broader sample of 23,984 individuals that also includes parents who report not having
11:418:33099:18:18:70:524:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wills (column (a)).  The table also presents summary statistics for the subsample of all
11:419:33187:18:0:70:524:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents who have both genetic children and stepchildren (column (c)) and the subsample
12:420:33275:0:18:70:450:759:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:of 2,342 parents with stepchildren who report having wills (column (d)).24
12:421:33349:18:19:88:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our covariates include standard demographic controls for parents’ age, sex, race, mar-
12:422:33435:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ital status, and number of marriages.  These variables capture basic heterogeneity within
12:423:33524:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and across households. We also include measures of annual family income and total wealth
12:424:33612:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(both expressed in 1995 prices), parents’ education and employment status.  We use these
12:425:33700:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables as controls for heterogeneity in parental resources.  HRS respondents are also
12:426:33788:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asked whether they gave money to at least one child or to all children equally; inter vivos
12:427:33879:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfers are known to depend more directly than bequests on children’s current incomes
12:428:33966:18:18:70:360:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and thus tend to be divided less evenly (McGarry 1999).
12:429:34021:18:18:88:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One of our key explanatory variables is an indicator variable for the presence of at
12:430:34105:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:least one genetic child and at least one stepchild.  The genetic-child hypothesis predicts
12:431:34195:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that parents will treat genetic children and stepchildren differently in allocating resources.
12:432:34289:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because parents’ ability or willingness to make transfers may depend on the total number
12:433:34377:18:18:70:421:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of children and stepchildren, we include these characteristics as well.
12:434:34448:18:18:88:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another key variable is parents’ lack of contact with their genetic children.  Parents
12:435:34534:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who  report  having  had  no  contact  with  at  least  one  of  their  genetic  children  over  the
12:436:34634:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous year are defined to be no-contact parents.  In subsection 5.D we will also consider
12:437:34726:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents with infrequent contact.  This latter group comprises parents who report having
12:438:34813:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:had at least one contact with their children over the last year, but not at least one contact
12:439:34906:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a month, while parents with frequent contacts are those who have contact at least once a
12:440:34994:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:month.  Exchange models predict that children with more regular contacts will be more
12:441:35079:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to receive bequests if these children are also more likely to provide care and support
12:442:35172:18:18:70:482:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to their needy older parents (Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers 1985; Cox 1987).
12:443:35250:18:18:88:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use parental health status (“poor or fair” as opposed to “good or excellent”) as
12:444:35333:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a proxy for a parent’s need for children’s services and hence, willingness to pay for them
12:445:35423:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., the exchange motive).  Using the parents’ reports of the children’s income and wealth
12:446:35515:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would substantially reduce the number of observations, so instead of doing so we predict
12:447:35603:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each child’s income using observed characteristics.  Following Light and McGarry (2004),
12:448:35691:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  predict  incomes  using  estimated  parameters  from  income  models  that  we  fit  to  the
12:449:35787:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data  from  the  Current  Population  Survey  (CPS)  between  1994  and  2006.   Our  sample
12:450:35879:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consists of all CPS respondents in the same age group as the parents/children in our HRS
12:451:35967:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample.  We estimate separate models for men and women using as regressors a constant,
12:452:36053:18:18:70:524:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a quartic in age, five dummy variables indicating the highest educational attainment, and
12:453:36142:18:18:70:524:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicator variables for race, marital status, number of children, and home ownership.  We
12:454:36231:18:18:70:524:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then use this predicted income variable to construct a measure of income differences, the
12:455:36320:18:18:70:524:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient of variation (obtained by dividing the standard deviation of estimated income
12:456:36409:18:19:70:335:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by its mean) among the children of each individual.
12:457:36460:19:16:80:524:90:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:24For the sake of brevity, summary statistics of the independent variables for the sample of contact/no-
12:458:36564:16:0:70:405:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:contact parents are not reported.  They are available on the online appendix.
13:459:36643:0:18:88:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For each of our covariates, we observe differences between parents with a will, parents
13:460:36730:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with stepchildren, and parents with stepchildren and a will (columns (b)–(d)).  Perhaps
13:461:36817:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unsurprisingly, the most striking differences are between parents in the core files (column
13:462:36908:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(a)) and those in the exit files (column (e)).  Compared with the parents in the core files,
13:463:37000:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents in the exit files are less educated and more likely to report being in poor or fair
13:464:37091:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health in the last wave in which they participated.  Parents in the exit files are older (and
13:465:37184:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thus more likely to be retired), and more likely to have been widowed (and hence to have
13:466:37272:18:30:70:199:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower household income).

13:479:38200:18:18:88:524:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Since the RE model assumes thatνiandCit(as well asνiandXit) are uncorrelated,
13:480:38277:18:18:70:524:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in subsection 5.A we shall present results based on fixed effects (FE) models, which do
13:481:38364:18:18:70:524:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not  impose  this  no-correlation  assumption.   In  the  same  subsection,  we  also  deal  with
13:482:38461:18:18:70:524:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the potential endogeneity of family complexity by using an instrumental variables (IV)

13:484:38633:18:40:70:186:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that part of the paper.
13:485:38656:40:25:70:244:226:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.  Benchmark Estimates
13:486:38679:25:18:70:524:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We present our benchmark estimates, emphasizing the roles of stepparents and parents
13:487:38763:18:18:70:524:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without  contact  with  at  least  one  of  their  genetic  children.   We  first  describe  who  has
13:488:38864:18:18:70:524:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  will  and  who  does  not  (subsection  A).  Then  we  analyze  whether  parents  include  all
13:489:38961:18:19:70:524:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children in the will and,  if they do,  whether they intend to leave equal bequests to all
13:490:39051:19:18:70:524:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children  (subsection  B).25We  next  investigate  how  health,  wealth,  and  previous  inter
13:491:39145:18:18:70:524:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vivos transfers affect the probability that HRS respondents intend to treat their children
13:492:39235:18:18:70:201:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unequally (subsection C).
13:493:39260:18:0:80:392:74:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:25It is worth keeping in mind that stepchildren are counted as children.
14:494:39334:0:26:70:303:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:A. Who Has a Will and Who Does Not
14:495:39368:26:18:70:524:733:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As  we  saw  in  Table  1,  the  fraction  of  HRS  respondents  who  have  children  but  do  not
14:496:39466:18:18:70:524:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have wills is substantial:  42 percent of those in the core files report not having a will.
14:497:39557:18:18:70:524:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A  complication  with  bequest  intention  data  is  right  censoring:  some  parents  who  will
14:498:39653:18:18:70:524:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eventually write wills have not done so at the time they respond to the survey.  Older and
14:499:39743:18:18:70:524:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less healthy parents, however, might be more likely than other respondents to write wills.
14:500:39833:18:19:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:So might unpartnered widows or widowers, who are the last ones to have the responsibility
14:501:39922:19:18:70:524:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of passing on the family estate to future generations.  To account for these possibilities, we
14:502:40016:18:18:70:524:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control for parental age and health status, and estimate separately the response of widows,
14:503:40107:18:18:70:524:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:widowers and divorced parents.  To assess the extent of the right censoring problem more
14:504:40195:18:18:70:281:570:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:directly, we use data from the exit files.26
14:505:40239:18:18:88:524:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 presents marginal effects from random effects probit estimates ofβin equation
14:506:40324:18:18:70:524:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1), that is, the impact of the presence of stepchildren on the probability that parents re-

14:508:40507:18:18:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:five specifications.  In specification (a) we include our basic set of controls (demographics,
14:509:40601:18:18:70:524:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:education, and employment status) as well as health status indicators.  Specification (b)
14:510:40690:18:18:70:524:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adds  measures  of  money  transfers  to  children,  while  specification  (c)  drops  these  mea-
14:511:40788:18:18:70:524:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sures of money transfers but includes controls for parents’ expected income and wealth.
14:512:40875:18:18:70:524:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specification (d) includes all previous measures,  while specification (e) also includes as
14:513:40966:18:18:70:524:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an additional regressor the coefficient of variation between children’s income.  Besides the
14:514:41058:18:18:70:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results for all parents, the table also shows results separately for fathers and for mothers,
14:515:41151:18:18:70:524:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and reports the pooled and separate effects for the subsamples of widowed and divorced
14:516:41237:18:18:70:111:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents.
14:517:41245:18:19:88:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although the descriptive statistics show that individuals with both genetic children
14:518:41329:19:18:70:524:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and stepchildren are less likely to report having wills than those with genetic children only,
14:519:41423:18:18:70:524:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates in Table 3 imply that our basic control variables largely account for this
14:520:41511:18:18:70:524:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference (column (a)), except for widows and for divorced fathers.  Widows are indeed 7
14:521:41600:18:18:70:524:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points more likely to have a will.  This is confirmed when we control for inter
14:522:41690:18:18:70:524:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vivos transfers and parental income and wealth (columns (b)–(d)), but the relationship
14:523:41776:18:18:70:524:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becomes weaker and loses statistical significance when we further control for the coefficient
14:524:41869:18:18:70:389:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of variation between children’s predicted income (column (e)).
14:525:41931:18:18:88:524:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For  divorced  fathers  with  stepchildren  we  find  that  the  probability  of  not  having  a
14:526:42027:18:18:70:524:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will is nearly 8 percentage points greater than the corresponding probability for divorced
14:527:42117:18:18:70:524:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fathers with genetic children only (column (a)).  Controlling for inter vivos transfers and
14:528:42208:18:18:70:524:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parental income and wealth leads to even greater estimates, ranging from 8 to 12 percent-
14:529:42297:18:16:80:524:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:26As mentioned in Section 3, 38 percent of parents in the exit files died intestate.  This slightly lower
14:530:42402:16:11:70:524:103:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:proportion  than  that  recorded  in  the  core  files  may  reflect  an  actual  change  in  parents’  behavior  or
14:531:42518:11:12:70:524:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:selection driven by differential attrition based on age, health, and socioeconomic status.  We leave this
14:532:42623:12:0:70:226:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:interesting issue for future research.
15:533:42663:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age points (columns (b) to (d)).  When we control for within-family income differences,
15:534:42750:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the probability of not having a will goes up to almost 20 percentage points.  In the next
15:535:42839:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subsection we examine whether the differential propensities to have a will reflect parental
15:536:42930:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preferences  to  favor  own  genetic  children  or  preferences  to  equalize  the  distribution  of
15:537:43030:18:18:70:323:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estates across all children, including stepchildren.
15:538:43082:18:18:88:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4 broadly confirms the results found for stepparents in the case of no-contact
15:539:43166:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents.  There are however two differences.  One is among fathers who are 10–12 per-
15:540:43251:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centage points more likely not to have a will if they have no contact with their genetic
15:541:43339:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children, although this relationship disappears when we control for expected wealth and
15:542:43426:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within-family income differences.  The other difference is among widowers who, regard-
15:543:43512:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less of the specification, are between 14 and 20 percentage points more likely to have no
15:544:43601:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will if they have no contact with their genetic children.  Lack of contact therefore may
15:545:43689:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:induce fathers in general, and widowers in particular, to eschew the allocations implied
15:546:43777:18:18:70:179:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by intestacy statutes.
15:547:43799:18:18:88:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We do not know, however, why so many individuals do not write wills.  Legal scholars
15:548:43883:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that procrastination is one of the most plausible explanations for intestacy (Weis-
15:549:43974:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bord 2012).  But procrastination does not manifest an intent to die intestate.  Likewise,
15:550:44063:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the high rate of intestacy is not the result of agreement with, or reliance on, the default
15:551:44154:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rules of heirship.  Although agreement with the default rules could reduce the need for a
15:552:44243:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will (Hirsch 2004), there is some (dated) anecdotal evidence that suggests that individu-
15:553:44332:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:als lacking a will do not intentionally rely on the default rules (Fellows, Simon, and Rau
15:554:44422:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1978; Contemporary Studies Project 1978).  Economists have also been moving away from
15:555:44507:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the notion that individuals who do not “opt out” could be assumed to prefer the default
15:556:44594:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Thaler and Sunstein 2008).  For example, in the context of retirement savings, Beshears
15:557:44682:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al.  (2009) provide strong empirical evidence that defaults do matter.  In the context
15:558:44771:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of intestacy, we have no empirical research to draw on.  Nonetheless, the earlier evidence
15:559:44861:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:used by legal experts and the empirical evidence found in other contexts argue against
15:560:44947:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assuming that individuals without wills prefer, and would have chosen, the distribution
15:561:45034:18:35:70:211:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mandated by intestacy law.

15:563:45088:26:18:70:524:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Conditional on parents having a will and having more than one child, we now investigate
15:564:45175:18:18:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two questions:  whether parentsincludeall children in their wills and whether they treat
15:565:45263:18:18:70:239:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all childrenequallyin their wills.
15:566:45297:18:18:88:524:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 presents random effects probit estimates of the stepchild variable on the proba-
15:567:45385:18:18:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bility that individuals include all children in their wills.  The five specifications in columns
15:568:45481:18:18:70:524:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(a)–(e) and the rest of the organization of the table are the same as in Table 3.  Table
15:569:45569:18:0:70:524:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5 reveals that for parents with stepchildren the likelihood of including all children in the
16:570:45663:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will is 28–39 percentage points lower than for parents without stepchildren.  This impact
16:571:45752:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is stronger in absolute value for mothers than for fathers, although controlling for income
16:572:45843:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dispersion between siblings reverses this result (column (e)).  In specification (d), moth-
16:573:45934:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ers with stepchildren are almost 38 percentage points less likely to report including all
16:574:46023:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children in their wills while fathers with stepchildren are about 27 percentage points less
16:575:46114:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to do so.  These negative effects are strongest for divorced parents with stepchil-
16:576:46204:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren,  with estimated impacts ranging between 59 and 63 percentage points lower than
16:577:46288:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  divorced  parents  without  stepchildren.   We  also  find  strong  negative  effects  among
16:578:46385:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:widows and widowers.  This might happen because widows and widowers write new wills
16:579:46468:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after the death of the spouse.  We shall return to this possibility in subsection 5.B, where
16:580:46560:18:18:70:283:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we analyze changes in bequest intentions.
16:581:46601:18:18:88:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  repeated  the  same  analysis  focusing  on  the  behavior  of  parents  who  have  only
16:582:46693:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic  children  but  who  have  no  contact  with  at  least  one  of  them.   The  results  are
16:583:46792:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presented in Appendix Table A2.  These are qualitatively very similar to those reported
16:584:46879:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 5.  Parents who have no contact with at least one of their genetic children are
16:585:46967:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:20–24  percentage  points  less  likely  to  include  all  children  in  the  will.   In  this  case,  it
16:586:47072:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is fathers (and not mothers) who generally have a higher propensity not to mention all
16:587:47158:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children in their wills.  Divorced parents (especially divorced fathers) show an even greater
16:588:47251:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood of not including all of their children in the will, although this likelihood is the
16:589:47345:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same as that found for all parents once we control for within-family differences (column
16:590:47433:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(e)).  No-contact parents therefore have a substantially greater propensity to treat their
16:591:47523:18:18:70:206:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic children unequally.
16:592:47550:18:18:88:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Conditional on having a will, we repeated the same analysis for the likelihood of having
16:593:47638:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a will in which all children are treated equally.  Table 6 reports the RE probit estimates for
16:594:47732:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents with stepchildren, while Appendix Table A3 reports the estimates for no-contact
16:595:47819:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents.  Table 6 indicates that the presence of stepchildren is always associated with a
16:596:47908:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerably lower probability of equal intended bequests and these differences are always
16:597:47998:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant at the 1 percent level.  For example, having both genetic children
16:598:48090:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and stepchildren as opposed to having genetic children only reduces the probability of a
16:599:48178:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will in which all children are treated equally by 31 percentage points (first row, column
16:600:48267:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(d)).  This negative effect is greater for mothers than for fathers (36 versus 25 percentage
16:601:48359:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points, respectively), and the difference is statistically significant at conventional levels.
16:602:48453:18:18:70:524:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But, as in Table 5, this gender difference is not robust to the inclusion of the coefficient
16:603:48545:18:18:70:357:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of variation of children’s predicted income (column (e)).
16:604:48602:18:18:88:524:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Unpartnered parents (either divorced or widowed) are generally less likely to plan equal
16:605:48690:18:18:70:524:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequests  if they have genetic  children  and stepchildren.  For  example,  divorced fathers
16:606:48782:18:19:70:524:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are 52 percentage points less likely to treat all children equally than divorced fathers with
16:607:48875:19:18:70:524:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic  children  only  (column  (d)).   Similar  responses  are  found  for  divorced  mothers
16:608:48971:18:0:70:524:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  well  as  for  widows  and  widowers,  and  the  gender  differences  are  never  statistically
17:609:49072:0:18:70:125:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant.
17:610:49084:18:19:88:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Without exceptions, the estimates in Appendix Table A3 reveal that parents who have
17:611:49167:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no contact with their genetic children are also less likely to plan an equal division of their
17:612:49261:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estates.   Parental  absence  is  on  average  associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  probability
17:613:49360:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  equal  bequest  intentions  of  28–32  percentage  points.   Slightly  larger  reductions  are
17:614:49458:18:18:70:463:668:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:observed among all fathers and among those who are divorced or widowed.27
17:615:49531:18:18:88:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In sum,  the estimates in Tables 5 and 6 and those in Appendix Tables A2 and A3
17:616:49610:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tell  a  consistent  story.   Parents  in  complex  families  are  less  likely  to  mention  all  their
17:617:49714:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children in the will.  Among such parents,  those who do mention all children are more
17:618:49800:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely  to  plan  an  unequal  division  of  end-of-life  transfers.   This  evidence  suggests  that
17:619:49901:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchildren and genetic children with no contact with their parents appear to face similar
17:620:49992:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:chances of inheriting from their stepparents and parents.  This result sits at odds with
17:621:50080:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the genetic-child hypothesis, according to which parents favor their own genetic offspring
17:622:50170:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over stepchildren, and seems instead to be driven mainly by other motives.  In the next
17:623:50257:18:35:70:310:506:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:subsection we explore this possibility further.28
17:624:50306:35:26:70:337:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:C. Health, Wealth, and Inter Vivos Transfers
17:625:50350:26:18:70:524:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In our analysis we included variables that are meant to proxy altruism and exchange as
17:626:50436:18:18:70:524:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequest motives.  We also controlled for gifts to children, since parents might adjust their
17:627:50528:18:18:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequest intentions if they made substantial inter vivos transfers.  The adjustment could
17:628:50616:18:18:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:go in either direction.  Parents might give less to children who already received inter vivos
17:629:50709:18:18:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfers to equalize lifetime transfers, or they might give more because previous transfers
17:630:50801:18:18:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicate greater need or closer ties.  We now briefly discuss these results that can be found
17:631:50894:18:18:70:188:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the online appendix.
17:632:50917:18:18:88:524:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In families with stepparents and in families with no-contact parents, wealth and income
17:633:51004:18:16:80:524:301:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:27The results in Tables 6 and A3 were found for parents with two or more childrenanda will.  An
17:634:51099:16:12:70:524:285:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:alternative sample selection is to include only parents with two or more children and a will that mentions
17:635:51205:12:12:70:524:273:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f6:F:allof the children.  This selection clearly leads to smaller samples.  But even when this more restrictive
17:636:51311:12:11:70:524:261:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:definition is used, we find effect estimates that are in line with (albeit of smaller magnitude than) those
17:637:51418:11:9:70:373:250:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:shown in Tables 6 and A3.  They are reported in Appendix Table A4.
17:638:51484:9:15:80:524:241:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:28It  should  be  emphasized  that  we  performed  several  robustness  checks.   The  estimates  from  these
17:639:51593:15:12:70:524:226:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:exercises by and large confirm the picture of bequest intentions that has emerged so far.  In one of the
17:640:51697:12:12:70:524:214:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:exercises, we disaggregated the overall effect of the stepchild indicator variable by the number of genetic
17:641:51804:12:12:70:524:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:children and stepchildren and distinguished among parents with one child in each category, those with two
17:642:51909:12:12:70:524:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:genetic children and one stepchild, those with one genetic child and two stepchildren, and those with two
17:643:52014:12:12:70:524:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:or more children in each category.  Virtually all our earlier results are robust to this change.  In another
17:644:52122:12:12:70:524:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:check, we took advantage of the fact that, regardless of whether individuals have a will, the HRS asks one
17:645:52228:12:12:70:524:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:respondent per household to report the probability of leaving a bequest worth at least $10,000, $100,000,
17:646:52333:12:12:70:524:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and $500,000, excluding any inheritance to be left to the surviving partner if he/she is still alive.  We
17:647:52438:12:12:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:banded all answers into six groups, i.e., we distinguished individuals who report a zero probability from
17:648:52543:12:12:70:524:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:those with a positive probability, and these in turn were banded into five quintiles.  Using random-effects
17:649:52650:12:12:70:524:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:ordered probit regressions, we then re-analyzed the models of having a will, inclusion of all children in
17:650:52755:12:12:70:524:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the will, and equal intended bequests.  Again, the results from this analysis are qualitatively very similar
17:651:52863:12:0:70:490:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:to those discussed above.  These and the previous estimates are reported in the online appendix.
18:652:52961:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have opposite effects on the probability of having a will.  Wealthier parents are less likely
18:653:53054:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to report not having a will.  But higher income parents are more likely to do so, perhaps
18:654:53143:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because such parents are likely to be younger and still in the labor force.  In both types
18:655:53233:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of families, having made inter vivos transfers is associated with a 5–9 percentage point
18:656:53321:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduction in the probability of not having a will.  Being in fair or poor health is associated
18:657:53415:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  a  5–10  percentage  point  increase  for  stepparents,  while  the  estimated  increase  is
18:658:53513:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:9–13 percentage points for no-contact parents.  Less healthy parents, who might be more
18:659:53600:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in need of care from their children, may have an incentive to have a will.  Finally, larger
18:660:53691:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences in children’s incomes are associated with a higher probability of not having a
18:661:53781:18:18:70:392:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will, although this relationship is never statistically significant.
18:662:53849:18:18:88:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Wealthier stepparents and wealthier no-contact parents are more likely to report in-
18:663:53933:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cluding all children in their wills as well as dividing their estates equally.  Moreover, for
18:664:54026:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents with stepchildren, greater parental income, which might be more common among
18:665:54110:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:younger (still working) parents, is associated with a reduction in both probabilities.  For
18:666:54201:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such parents, we also estimate that parents who have already made inter vivos transfers
18:667:54288:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have a 7 percentage point higher probability of including all children in their wills and 11
18:668:54380:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage point higher probability of intending equal bequests.  For no-contact parents,
18:669:54469:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relationship with income is weaker and the effect of inter vivos transfers is smaller.
18:670:54559:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, having already made inter vivos transfers increases the probability of includ-
18:671:54651:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing all children in the will by 4–5 percentage points and the probability of equal bequest
18:672:54741:18:18:70:255:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intentions by 5–7 percentage points.
18:673:54777:18:18:88:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For both types of families, greater income dispersion between siblings is associated with
18:674:54866:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a lower probability that wills include all children and a greater probability that parents
18:675:54956:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intend to divide their estates unequally.  Although these correlations are not statistically
18:676:55048:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant, if we assume that parents intend to give more to low-income children, then
18:677:55135:18:18:70:294:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are consistent with altruistic behavior.
18:678:55180:18:18:88:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Parents in poor health are 2 to 4 percentage points less likely to include all children
18:679:55267:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the will and, conditional on mentioning all children, around 4 percentage points less
18:680:55355:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to include all of them equally.  If poor health reflects parents’ long-term need for
18:681:55446:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:child assistance, these results suggest that parents may use their intended future transfers,
18:682:55539:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which they could make known to their children, to elicit a long-term flow of services.  This
18:683:55631:18:39:70:493:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is consistent with the exchange motive documented by Light and McGarry (2004).
18:684:55709:39:26:70:274:160:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.  Further Empirical Results
18:685:55738:26:18:70:524:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we discuss further results in four subsections.  Specifically, in subsection
18:686:55830:18:18:70:524:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A we compare our benchmark RE estimates with the estimates found with FE models
18:687:55909:18:18:70:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  those  found  with  an  instrumental  variables  approach.   In  subsection  B  we  exploit
18:688:56005:18:0:70:524:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  longitudinal  aspect  of  the  HRS  examining  changes  in  bequest  intentions,  while  in
19:689:56103:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subsection C we turn from bequest intentions to the actual division of estates using the
19:690:56191:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exit  files.   Finally,  in  subsection  D  we  examine  how  contacts  and  interactions  between
19:691:56289:19:34:70:456:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents and children in complex families are related to end-of-life transfers.
19:692:56367:34:26:70:466:688:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:A. Evidence from Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variables Models
19:693:56431:26:18:70:523:662:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:FE Estimates— As mentioned in Section 3, the RE estimates presented so far rely on the
19:694:56517:18:18:70:524:644:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumption that the unobserved individual-specific component of the error term and our
19:695:56603:18:18:70:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure of family complexity (i.e.,νiandCit, respectively, in equation (1)) are uncorre-
19:696:56691:18:18:70:524:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lated.  A concern with the RE estimates is that the effect of family complexity on bequest
19:697:56781:18:18:70:524:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior  might  be  spurious.   But  this  may  be  due  precisely  to  the  mutual  association
19:698:56878:18:18:70:524:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that family complexity and bequest behavior share with some unmeasured causal factor.
19:699:56963:18:19:70:524:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, the association between having stepchildren (or having no contact with ge-
19:700:57051:19:18:70:524:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:netic children) and not mentioning all children equally in the will may not be driven by
19:701:57139:18:18:70:524:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:family complexity per se.  Rather, it may reflect some hard-to-measure characteristics of
19:702:57228:18:18:70:524:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the complex families in which older individuals live, such as the personality of their new
19:703:57318:18:18:70:190:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:partners or frail health.
19:704:57343:18:18:88:524:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although the primary goal of this paper is not to provide estimates that have a causal
19:705:57429:18:18:70:524:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interpretation,  we  also  performed  our  analysis  estimating  equation  (1)  with  FE  linear
19:706:57525:18:18:70:524:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability models.  Indeed we do not see these estimates as offering a casual effect of
19:707:57613:18:18:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:family complexity,  but rather as providing us with a robustness check of the estimates
19:708:57700:18:18:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we reported earlier.  The FE estimates are shown in panel A of Table 7 where, for ease
19:709:57786:18:18:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  comparison,  we  also  report  the  RE  estimates  from  our  basic  specification  discussed
19:710:57883:18:18:70:111:355:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:above.29
19:711:57891:18:18:88:524:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Consider first the estimates for stepparents.  In the cases of inclusion of all children
19:712:57979:18:18:70:524:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the will and of equal division (columns (b) and (c) respectively), the FE estimates are
19:713:58069:18:18:70:524:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:just slightly smaller (in absolute value) than the corresponding benchmark RE estimates,
19:714:58157:18:18:70:524:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but they have the same sign and the same level of statistical significance.  The economic
19:715:58246:18:18:70:490:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interpretation of them is therefore the same as that of our previous RE estimates.
19:716:58328:18:18:88:524:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If instead we look at the probability of having no will (column (a)), the FE estimates
19:717:58414:18:19:70:524:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reveal that stepparents are 2 percentage points less likely to have no will than their coun-
19:718:58506:19:18:70:524:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terparts without stepchildren, while the RE estimates revealed no difference between the
19:719:58594:18:18:70:524:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two groups of parents.  Albeit quantitatively small, this difference reveals that steppar-
19:720:58684:18:18:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ents may be less willing to rely on the default rules of heirship, than what we would have
19:721:58774:18:18:70:218:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inferred from the RE results.
19:722:58803:18:18:88:524:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to no-contact families, the FE estimates show no significant relationship be-
19:723:58888:18:18:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tween  this  type  of  families  and  their  likelihood  of  having  no  will  (column  (d)).   The
19:724:58987:18:18:70:524:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference between the FE results and the RE estimates disappears,  however,  when we
19:725:59072:18:0:80:455:84:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:29The FE estimates from the other specifications are available in the online appendix.
20:726:59160:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:move to richer specifications: indeed Table 4 (specifications (c)–(e)) reveals no correlation
20:727:59253:18:19:70:383:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:among all groups of no-contact families, except for widowers.
20:728:59314:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, in the cases of inclusion of all children and of equal division, the FE estimates
20:729:59404:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:confirm the negative link found with the RE models, but the FE estimates are about 70 to
20:730:59492:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:76 percent lower in absolute value.  This may suggest that the strength of the association
20:731:59582:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between  lack  of  contact  and  bequest  behavior  is  lower  than  that  suggested  by  the  RE
20:732:59679:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates.  But it may also reveal the presence of substantial measurement errors in the
20:733:59767:18:18:70:523:632:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:Citvariable which would bias our estimates toward zero.  Because of this possibility, we
20:734:59855:18:30:70:322:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:now turn to the instrumental variables approach.
20:735:59903:30:18:70:524:584:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:IV Estimates— To account for the potential endogeneity of family complexity in (1) and
20:736:59989:18:18:70:524:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limit the possible problem of measurement error inCit, which could be exacerbated by
20:737:60073:18:18:70:524:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the FE model, we resort to an instrumental variables approach.  The variable we use to
20:738:60159:18:18:70:524:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instrument for family complexity is a novel measure of optimism, which we construct using
20:739:60248:18:18:70:524:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual expectations information contained in the HRS questionnaires.  In particular,
20:740:60336:18:18:70:524:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  use  a  measure  that  combines  the  individuals’  responses  to  two  questions,  one  on
20:741:60431:18:18:70:524:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inflation expectations over the next 10 years and the other on the expectation of a major
20:742:60520:18:18:70:524:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depression over the next 10 years.  We use optimism as a predictor of life choices which,
20:743:60609:18:18:70:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in turn, are linked to family complexity.  A complete description of this variable and its
20:744:60699:18:18:70:524:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subcomponents is available in the online appendix, where we also discuss its relationship
20:745:60788:18:19:70:403:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with individuals’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
20:746:60852:19:18:88:524:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The only other economic study that correlates optimism to life choices (and remarriage,
20:747:60939:18:18:70:524:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:among others) is Puri and Robinson (2007).  Their measure of optimism, however, is based
20:748:61027:18:18:70:524:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on individuals’ life expectancy miscalibration (that is, the gap between individuals’ self-
20:749:61118:18:18:70:524:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reported life expectancy and that implied by actuarial tables), while ours does not refer
20:750:61207:18:18:70:524:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  events  that  are  affected  by  respondents’  life  decisions.   This  difference  is  important
20:751:61308:18:18:70:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because  life  expectancy  and  life  expectancy  miscalibration  are  likely  to  be  endogenous
20:752:61405:18:18:70:524:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to family structure and other life decisions, e.g., health choices, which in turn might be
20:753:61495:18:18:70:297:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with individual bequest behavior.
20:754:61539:18:18:88:524:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Social and medical scientists have provided a wealth of evidence indicating that dispo-
20:755:61626:18:18:70:524:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sitional optimism — whereby one has a positive general outlook about future events and
20:756:61712:18:18:70:524:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:life in general — does matter for physical and psychological well-being (Scheier, Carver,
20:757:61801:18:18:70:524:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Bridges 1994; Solberg Nes and Segerstrom 2006).  For example, there is a large body
20:758:61888:18:18:70:524:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of evidence that documents that optimistic cancer patients face lower mortality risk and
20:759:61976:18:18:70:524:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experience faster recovery after surgery than pessimists (e.g., Schulz et al.  1996; Scheier
20:760:62068:18:18:70:524:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al.  1989; Rasmussen, Scheier, and Greenhouse 2009).  Puri and Robinson (2007) find
20:761:62154:18:18:70:524:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that more optimistic people work harder, expect to retire later, invest more in individual
20:762:62244:18:19:70:524:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stocks, and save more.  They also find that optimists who report they have been divorced
20:763:62332:19:0:70:242:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:before are more likely to remarry.
21:764:62368:0:18:88:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our IV results are reported in panel B of Table 7.  These are obtained from bivariate
21:765:62453:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probit regressions in which the first and second stages are estimated jointly. The first stage
21:766:62547:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicts family complexity,Cit,  using the residuals of our measure of optimism from a
21:767:62633:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regression of optimism on age and sex.  To account for the fact that we include a predicted
21:768:62724:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable, the bivariate probit standard errors are estimated using a bootstrap method that,
21:769:62815:18:18:70:484:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due to the panel nature of the data, also allows for within-individual correlation.
21:770:62898:18:18:88:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Irrespective of the type of complex family (whether stepfamily or no-contact family)
21:771:62982:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  across  all  three  bequest  outcomes,  theχ2tests  and  correspondingp-values  in  the
21:772:63074:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first stage suggest that our instrument is always statistically relevant.  We find that, on
21:773:63165:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average, an increase in optimism of 1 percent leads to a reduction in the likelihood that
21:774:63254:18:18:70:463:578:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the HRS respondents live in a complex family of 0.1–0.2 percentage points.30
21:775:63330:18:18:88:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  stage  estimates  indicate  that  stepparents  are  26  percentage  points  less
21:776:63423:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to include all children in their wills and 31 percentage points less likely to intend
21:777:63515:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equal division of their estate than parents with only genetic children (columns (b) and (c),
21:778:63607:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively).  These are very close to the benchmark RE estimates we found in Section 4.
21:779:63696:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The corresponding IV estimates for the sample of parents without contact with at least
21:780:63782:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one of their genetic children are instead significantly larger in absolute value than those
21:781:63873:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obtained from the RE models (columns (e) and (f)).  This last result suggests the possible
21:782:63963:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presence  of  unobserved  common  factors  shared  by  the  processes  that  generate  bequest
21:783:64057:19:18:70:369:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intentions and the likelihood of living in a complex family.
21:784:64117:18:18:88:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the IV estimates in columns (a) and (d) show that parents in complex fam-
21:785:64199:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ilies are, respectively, 21 and 6 percentage points more likely to have no will than their
21:786:64289:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple family counterparts.  The latter estimate is statistically insignificant and is indis-
21:787:64382:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tinguishable from the corresponding RE estimate shown in Table 4.  The significant and
21:788:64468:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive sign of the former coefficient, instead, may indicate that parents in stepfamilies
21:789:64559:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are substantially more reluctant to make wills than implied by the RE models in Table
21:790:64644:18:30:70:367:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3.  Family complexity may encourage this procrastination.
21:791:64701:30:18:88:524:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, the results presented in Section 4 provide us with a useful benchmark, with
21:792:64784:18:18:70:524:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the RE estimates being almost always between the FE estimates and the IV estimates.
21:793:64867:18:18:70:524:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Although the FE model does not impose a zero-correlation assumption between the unob-
21:794:64952:18:18:70:524:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:served individual component of the residuals andCit, its estimates might exacerbate the
21:795:65039:18:17:70:524:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:problems due to measurement error in the family complexity variables.  The gaps between
21:796:65126:17:16:80:524:170:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:30This result is not in line with the finding by Puri and Robinson (2007) that more optimistic people
21:797:65227:16:12:70:524:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are more likely to remarry.  A number of reasons may explain this difference.  For example, we employ a
21:798:65330:12:12:70:524:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:different measure of optimism.  Moreover, the individuals in their sample are almost twenty years younger
21:799:65435:12:12:70:524:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:than the HRS respondents in our study.  Finally, we consider the whole population while they focus on
21:800:65536:12:12:70:524:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:individuals who have been divorced.  For comparison, we also repeated our analysis on the subsample of
21:801:65638:12:12:70:524:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:divorced individuals.  We found results similar to those shown in Table 7.  These estimates are available in
21:802:65746:12:12:70:524:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the online appendix.  More generally, our findings are consistent with the evidence from the psychological
21:803:65852:12:12:70:524:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:literature that documents that optimists are a positive resource for close relationships (Srivastava et al.
21:804:65959:12:0:70:182:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2006; Carver et al.  2010).
22:805:65988:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the IV and the RE estimates shown in Table 7 might instead reflect the downward bias
22:806:66072:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the RE estimates attributable to measurement errors, with only a small bias in the RE
22:807:66160:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates induced by omitted variables.31They might also reflect unobserved differences
22:808:66247:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between  the  characteristics  of  the  treatment  and  comparison  groups  (optimists  versus
22:809:66341:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pessimists in our case) implicit in the IV approach.  Our results therefore suggest that the
22:810:66433:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:RE estimates are likely to be not far off the mark.  For this reason the results we report
22:811:66523:18:34:70:345:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the following subsections rely on RE specifications.

22:814:66700:18:18:70:524:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For each of our three bequest outcomes,  these can be readily estimated using equation

22:816:66873:18:18:70:524:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  their  intentions.   Of  those  who  do  not  have  a  will  in  one  wave  88  percent  remain
22:817:66972:18:18:70:524:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:without a will in the subsequent wave, and 86 percent (or 79 percent) of those intending
22:818:67060:18:18:70:524:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to bequeath to all children (or to all children equally) at one point in time continue to do
22:819:67152:18:18:70:298:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so the subsequent time they are interviewed.
22:820:67196:18:18:88:524:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  focus  on  the  transitions  from  not  having  a  will  to  having  a  will,  from  having
22:821:67291:18:18:70:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a will that does not include all children to having a will that includes all children, and
22:822:67381:18:19:70:524:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from unequal intended bequests to equal intended bequests.32In our analysis we explicitly
22:823:67470:19:18:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider the interaction of the presence of stepchildren or parental absence with changes in
22:824:67562:18:18:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents’ marital status (e.g., divorce and death of a spouse).  Several other changes might
22:825:67653:18:18:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interact with bequest plans and the joint presence of genetic children and stepchildren or
22:826:67743:18:18:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the lack of contact with genetic children, such as changes in parental health and changes
22:827:67832:18:18:70:524:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in children’s economic situations.  These however are not modeled, due to the small size
22:828:67920:18:18:70:147:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of our samples.
22:829:67935:18:18:88:524:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 8 shows the results from a specification that includes changes in our basic set
22:830:68020:18:18:70:524:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of controls, health status, money transfers to children, and parental income and wealth
22:831:68107:18:18:70:524:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(comparable to specification (d) in Tables 3–6).  The estimates of interest are robust to
22:832:68196:18:18:70:524:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their exclusion. In panel A we look at stepparents, while in panel B we focus on no-contact
22:833:68287:18:18:70:524:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents.  For each transition, we report two sets of coefficients.  In the first column, we
22:834:68378:18:18:70:524:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present the impact of having stepchildren or genetic children with whom the parent has no
22:835:68467:18:18:70:524:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact on the transition under study.  In the second we also show the interaction terms of
22:836:68558:18:17:70:524:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the stepparent or no-contact parent variable with two changes in parental marital status:
22:837:68647:17:16:80:524:158:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:31This is confirmed by positive regression coefficients found when we regress each measure of family
22:838:68747:16:12:70:524:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:complexity,Cit, on the random effectsνifor each bequest outcome,Yit.  See Card (2001) for a similar
22:839:68846:12:8:70:389:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:interpretation in the context of the estimation of the return to schooling.
22:840:68921:8:16:80:524:122:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:32The  picture  emerging  from  the  three  transitions  in  the  opposite  directions  is  consistent  with  that
22:841:69035:16:12:70:524:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:obtained from the three transitions just mentioned.  They are therefore not presented, but are available
22:842:69139:12:12:70:524:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:in the web appendix.  In the same appendix, for completeness, we also report the estimates obtained from
22:843:69243:12:12:70:524:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:all other transitions, such as from not having a will to having a will that includes all children equally, or
22:844:69352:12:0:70:353:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:from having a will that includes all children to not having a will.
23:845:69421:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from marriage to divorce and from marriage to widowhood.  This is important because,
23:846:69505:18:19:70:480:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:following divorce or the death of a spouse, an individual might write a new will.
23:847:69586:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In panels C and D we analyze this possibility more directly by considering only the
23:848:69669:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subsample of widows and widowers.  In this case, we first analyze whether parents write
23:849:69756:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a new will or change an old will after the death of their partner (first column).  In the
23:850:69845:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second column we present the estimates of how the presence of stepchildren or no-contact
23:851:69933:18:18:70:302:650:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:children changes bequest intentions further.33
23:852:69979:18:18:88:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panel A of Table 8 reveals that the transition from not having a will to having a will
23:853:70065:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  not  affected  by  the  joint  presence  of  stepchildren  and  genetic  children.   This  is  also
23:854:70168:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case when the presence of stepchildren is interacted with the two changes in marital
23:855:70256:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:status.   The  joint  presence  of  genetic  children  and  stepchildren,  instead,  significantly
23:856:70354:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces  the  probability  of  a  transition  to  a  will  in  which  all  children  are  included  as
23:857:70456:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well as the transition from unequal to equal bequests.  Having stepchildren reduces the
23:858:70543:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:former transition by almost 9 percentage points (column (c)) and the latter by around 8
23:859:70630:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points (column (e)).  Controlling for changes in parents’ marital status does
23:860:70718:18:18:70:383:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not significantly alter these results (see columns (d) and (f)).
23:861:70782:18:18:88:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The presence of stepchildren therefore is negatively correlated not only with the prob-
23:862:70869:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ability of equal intended bequests but also with the probability of changing the will from
23:863:70959:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unequal to equal treatment of children.  Having lost a partner through divorce or death
23:864:71046:19:18:70:309:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generally makes this transition even less likely.
23:865:71095:18:18:88:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panel  B  confirms  virtually  all  the  previous  results  for  the  case  of  parents  with  no-
23:866:71193:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact children.  Generally the estimated effects are larger in absolute value among these
23:867:71284:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents than among stepparents.  The only exceptions are in columns (d) and (f) where
23:868:71369:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the reductions in the probability that no-contact children are included in the will and are
23:869:71460:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned equally are not statistically significant if the no-contact parent’s partner dies.
23:870:71552:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This could be driven by the low statistical power of our small samples.  We assess this
23:871:71639:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:issue more directly in the next two panels in which we focus on the subsample of widows
23:872:71726:18:18:70:142:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and widowers.
23:873:71739:18:18:88:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For this subsample we draw attention to four interesting results.  First, the estimates
23:874:71826:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for widowed stepparents are qualitatively similar to those for no-contact parents.  Second,
23:875:71917:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:widowhood in all complex families increases the likelihood of changing bequest intentions:
23:876:72007:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it increases the transition to writing a will, having a will in which all children are men-
23:877:72098:18:18:70:524:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tioned,  and  having  a  will  in  which  all  children  are  equally  included  (columns  (a),  (c),
23:878:72199:18:18:70:524:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  (e)).   Third,  stepchildren  or  no-contact  children  neither  increase  nor  decrease  par-
23:879:72298:18:18:70:524:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ents’ greater propensity of writing a will (column (b)), but offset their parents’ greater
23:880:72388:18:18:70:524:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:propensities of including all children in the wills and including them all equally (columns
23:881:72479:18:19:70:524:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(d)  and  (f)).   Fourth,  the  presence  of  stepchildren  combined  with  the  loss  of  a  spouse
23:882:72579:19:16:80:524:90:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:33Other interesting changes in marital status (e.g., remarriage and repartnering) cannot be analyzed
23:883:72679:16:0:70:250:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:separately due to sample size limitations.
24:884:72723:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:further  reduces  the  likelihood  of  moving  to  a  will  with  full  inclusion  by  13  percentage
24:885:72824:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points and the likelihood of moving to a will with equal division by 9 percentage points
24:886:72912:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(panel C). Such further reductions are not observed among no-contact parents (panel D).
24:887:72999:18:34:70:428:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This evidence is consistent with what we found in the top two panels.
24:888:73068:34:26:70:435:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:C. Actual End-of-Life Transfers:  Evidence from the Exit Files
24:889:73130:26:18:70:524:644:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The HRS exit files provide direct information about end-of-life transfers.  The exit files
24:890:73220:18:18:70:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contain reports by the surviving spouse or partner or by other close family members of
24:891:73306:18:18:70:524:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the deceased HRS respondent and they allow us to analyze the actual division of estates
24:892:73393:18:18:70:524:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than bequest intentions.  Unlike the core files, the exit files do not suffer from right
24:893:73488:18:18:70:524:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:censoring but they are much smaller than the core files and the HRS respondents who die
24:894:73575:18:19:70:354:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:early are not a random subsample of HRS respondents.
24:895:73627:19:18:88:524:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 9 gives a summary of our results.  For each outcome we show probit estimates
24:896:73709:18:18:70:524:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from two specifications.  The first includes controls for standard demographics (column
24:897:73796:18:18:70:524:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(a)),  while  the  second  further  controls  for  year-of-death  fixed  effects,  an  indicator  for
24:898:73897:18:18:70:524:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether the death was expected, earlier transfers to children, and parental wealth (column
24:899:73987:18:18:70:102:463:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:(b)).34
24:900:73994:18:18:88:524:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When looking at the probability of intestate succession (in the first two columns of
24:901:74078:18:18:70:524:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 9), the estimated coefficient of the stepchild variable is always statistically indis-
24:902:74170:18:18:70:524:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tinguishable from 0.  This result, which holds true across all family types and for both
24:903:74258:18:18:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fathers  and  mothers,  confirms  the  general  findings  reported  in  Table  3.   From  the  exit
24:904:74357:18:18:70:524:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:files, however, we detect neither the negative effect for widows nor the positive effect for
24:905:74449:18:18:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:divorced fathers which were found using the core files.  This might reflect an actual change
24:906:74541:18:18:70:524:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in parents’ behavior with respect to their bequest intentions.  That is, it is possible that
24:907:74633:18:18:70:524:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:widows and divorced fathers with stepchildren are not more (nor less) likely to rely on
24:908:74720:18:18:70:524:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intestacy law than their counterparts without stepchildren.  But it could also be due to
24:909:74808:18:18:70:448:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the low statistical power implied by the small sample size of the exit files.
24:910:74885:18:18:88:524:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the next two columns, we consider the probability of including all children in the
24:911:74970:18:18:70:524:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will.   This  is  estimated  on  the  subsample  of  HRS  respondents  who  wrote  a  will,  while
24:912:75068:18:19:70:524:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those  who  died  intestate  are  not  included.   We  generally  find  that  having  stepchildren
24:913:75166:19:18:70:524:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does  not  affect  the  likelihood  that  all  children  are  included  (column  (a)).   This  result
24:914:75267:18:18:70:524:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emerges for the full sample as well as for all the subsamples of mothers and fathers by
24:915:75354:18:18:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marital status.  It contradicts what we found in Table 5 using the core files.  Indeed, in
24:916:75444:18:18:70:524:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two out of the nine cases under specification (b), we even find apositiveand significant
24:917:75532:18:18:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of the stepparent indicator.  This result might indicate a strategy according to which
24:918:75625:18:18:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepparents end up including all their children (including stepchildren) in their final will.
24:919:75718:18:16:80:524:102:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:34The table reports the estimates on the stepchild indicator found among families with stepparents.
24:920:75817:16:12:70:524:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:The exit files do not allow us to perform the same analysis on parents who did not have contacts with
24:921:75918:12:0:70:165:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:their genetic children.
25:922:75943:0:18:88:523:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Would all children be includedequally?  The last two columns, where we present the
25:923:76025:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates  for  the  probability  of  equal  bequests,  suggest  that  they  are  not.35In  fact,
25:924:76122:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  line  with  the  bequest  intention  estimates  of  Table  6,  the  results  in  Table  9  indicate
25:925:76225:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the presence of stepchildren reduces the probability that actual bequests are equal
25:926:76313:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by  9  percentage  points  (first  line,  specification  (a)).   This  impact  is  roughly  a  fourth
25:927:76414:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the magnitude of the corresponding impact on intended bequests.  As in the case of
25:928:76499:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  core  files,  the  estimated  effect  of  stepchildren  on  equal  actual  bequests  is  greater
25:929:76600:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for  fathers  than  for  mothers,  although  the  relatively  large  standard  errors  make  this
25:930:76697:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differential  response  by  gender  statistically  indistinguishable  from  0.   We  also  cannot
25:931:76794:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:detect differential impacts for the subpopulations of parents who experienced divorce or
25:932:76882:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the death of a spouse or partner.  But the probability of equal bequests is particularly
25:933:76970:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low for divorced mothers and widowers, with estimated effects similar to those we found
25:934:77057:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the intended bequests.  Some of these effects lose their statistical significance when we
25:935:77150:18:18:70:502:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate specification (b), but by and large the main pattern of results is confirmed.
25:936:77236:18:18:88:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, the presence of stepchildren does not affect the probability of writing a will.
25:937:77323:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Stepparents might explicitly decide to rely on intestacy statutes which would leave nothing
25:938:77414:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to stepchildren.  For parents who die with a will, the actual bequests observed in the exit
25:939:77505:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:files are largely consistent with the bequest intentions reported in the core files.  Unequal
25:940:77598:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bequests  are  a  distinguishing  feature  of  stepparents  whose  genetic  children  are  favored
25:941:77696:19:34:70:324:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over stepchildren in the actual division of estates.
25:942:77748:34:26:70:342:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:D. Interactions between Parents and Children
25:943:77792:26:18:70:524:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now focus on how interactions between parents and children are related to the proba-
25:944:77879:18:18:70:524:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bility that the children are mentioned in the will.  We first look at the stepparent–stepchild
25:945:77973:18:18:70:524:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interaction and investigate whether stepchildren are less likely to be included in the will
25:946:78064:18:18:70:387:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a stepparent when the stepparent also has genetic children.
25:947:78126:18:18:88:524:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 10 presents random effects probit estimates of the probability that a stepchild is
25:948:78214:18:18:70:524:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned in the stepparent’s will for the whole sample of stepchildren.  The table shows
25:949:78303:18:18:70:524:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the results from five specifications.  In specification (a) we include a basic set of controls
25:950:78397:18:19:70:524:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., parent and child’s age and gender), the age at which the child became a stepchild, and
25:951:78490:19:18:70:524:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the number of years spent with the stepparent.  Specification (b) also controls for whether
25:952:78581:18:18:70:524:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the stepparent reported providing care for the stepchild’s child(ren), while specification
25:953:78671:18:18:70:524:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(c) includes an indicator of whether the stepchild was the main recipient of inter vivos
25:954:78759:18:18:70:524:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfers from the stepparent. Specification (d) adds a measure of the stepchild’s predicted
25:955:78851:18:18:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income, which was constructed using the procedure described in Section 3, and controls
25:956:78937:18:18:70:524:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the within-family difference between the stepchild’s predicted income and the genetic
25:957:79026:18:18:70:524:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:child’s income (or the income mean when there are two or more genetic children).  We
25:958:79110:18:0:80:470:84:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:35As before, this analysis is based only on the subsample of parents who died with a will.
26:959:79202:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distinguish three subgroups, one in which the stepchild’s income is equal or greater than
26:960:79291:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the genetic child’s, another in which it is 1–49 percent lower, and the last one in which
26:961:79380:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is 50+ percent lower.36Finally, specification (e) includes an indicator of whether the
26:962:79469:18:18:70:433:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepparent expects to receive help from his/her stepchild in the future.
26:963:79541:18:18:88:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 10 reveals that for a child whose stepparent also has a genetic child the prob-
26:964:79626:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ability of being included in the will is 3–4 percentage points lower, an average impact of
26:965:79716:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about 15 percent (columns (a)–(e)).  This is consistent with the genetic-child hypothesis
26:966:79805:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:according to which parents tend to favor children who share their genes.  This negative
26:967:79892:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relationship is entirely eliminated,  however,  if the stepchild’s predicted income is lower
26:968:79984:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than the genetic child’s (specification (d)).  Nearly two-fifths of stepchildren in the sample
26:969:80078:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have relatively lower incomes.  This finding is consistent with altruism if parents not only
26:970:80170:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are more likely to mention low-income stepchildren in their wills (as we find here), but
26:971:80258:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also  give  them  more.   We  cannot  test  this  last  point  because,  as  mentioned  in  Section
26:972:80357:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3.B,  the  HRS  does  not  contain  any  information  about  the  monetary  amount  that  the
26:973:80450:18:18:70:304:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondents intend to bequeath to each child.
26:974:80495:18:18:88:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Across all specifications, the older the stepparent the higher the likelihood that the
26:975:80581:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchild is included in the will: the stepchild penalty is offset if the stepparent is 10 years
26:976:80677:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:older than the average stepparent.  This may indicate a greater need for the stepchild’s
26:977:80765:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assistance.  These findings mirror the relationship between parents and their genetic chil-
26:978:80856:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren.  In particular, they suggest that stepparents may use bequests to elicit a long-term
26:979:80946:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flow of reciprocal services rather than episodic short-term care.  It is possible, in fact, that
26:980:81042:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:episodic short-term care could be “paid for” by inter vivos transfers.  This behavior is con-
26:981:81135:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sistent with the strategic use of bequests postulated by Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers
26:982:81222:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1985).  Children whose stepparents are in poor/fair health (another possible indicator of
26:983:81312:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:need) have however a 5–6 percentage pointdecreasein the probability of being included
26:984:81397:18:18:70:125:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the will.
26:985:81409:18:18:88:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 10 also shows that, regardless of the age at which a child acquired the stepparent,
26:986:81498:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the more years he/she spent with the stepparent the higher the likelihood of being in-
26:987:81584:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cluded in the will: 7–10 years of stepchildhood completely eliminate the stepchild penalty.
26:988:81675:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, a stepchild’s probability of inclusion in the will goes up by about 6–8 percent-
26:989:81765:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age  points  if  the  stepparent  reports  having  provided  care  for  the  stepchild’s  child(ren)
26:990:81865:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(specifications  (b)–(e))  and  by  another  13–14  percentage  points  if  the  stepchild  is  also
26:991:81965:18:18:70:524:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the main recipient of inter vivos transfers (specifications (c)–(e)).  This may reflect trust
26:992:82058:18:18:70:524:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and bonding, which are strengthened by repeated interactions over longer time periods.
26:993:82144:18:18:70:524:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, if stepparents expect help from their stepchildren in the future, the likelihood the
26:994:82237:18:19:70:524:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchild is mentioned in the will goes up by 14 percentage points (a 54 percent increase
26:995:82326:19:16:80:524:108:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:36We checked the sensitivity of this cutoff using different partitions (e.g., at one-third and two-thirds
26:996:82431:16:11:70:524:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of the genetic child’s income), and found results that are essentially identical to those shown in Table 10.
26:997:82539:11:0:70:288:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:These alternative estimates are thus not reported.
27:998:82591:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over the baseline probability).  This result suggests again the presence of exchange motives
27:999:82683:18:19:70:386:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with parents using bequests strategically toward stepchildren.
27:1000:82745:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Stratifying  the  sample  by  gender  (see  Appendix  Tables  A5  and  A6),  we  find  that
27:1001:82836:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the negative association between the probability of being mentioned in the will and the
27:1002:82923:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presence of a step-sibling (i.e., the variable ‘stepparent has own genetic children’) is con-
27:1003:83016:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centrated  among  male  stepchildren,  who  experience  a  reduction  in  this  probability  of
27:1004:83111:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about  5–9  percentage points.  Female stepchildren experience  a reduction of  at most 3
27:1005:83200:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points but this reduction is never statistically significant.  For female stepchil-
27:1006:83294:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren  the  probability  of  being  mentioned  in  the  will  is  also  unaffected  by  differences  in
27:1007:83396:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children’s predicted incomes.  The relationship between stepparental expectation about
27:1008:83482:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future  help  and  inclusion  in  the  will  is  stronger  for  female  stepchildren  (17  percentage
27:1009:83583:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points for female as opposed to 11 percentage points for male stepchildren).  The same
27:1010:83669:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pattern of results, with the same gender differences, persists when we focus on the sub-
27:1011:83757:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:samples of stepchildren of divorced and widowed parents.  These results are reported in
27:1012:83844:18:18:70:175:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the online appendix.
27:1013:83864:18:18:88:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We now turn our attention to no-contact parent–genetic child interactions and inves-
27:1014:83948:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tigate how contacts in complex families affect bequest intentions.  In Table 11 we report
27:1015:84037:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:how the probability that a genetic child is mentioned in his/her parent’s will varies with
27:1016:84127:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  frequency  of  contact  and  with  the  fact  that  the  parent’s  spouse  is  not  genetically
27:1017:84227:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related to the child.37The first two columns of the table show that parents who have
27:1018:84311:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no contact with their genetic children are 21–24 percentage points less likely to mention
27:1019:84400:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them in their wills.  The lack of parent–child contact therefore more than halves the child’s
27:1020:84493:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:odds of inclusion in the parent’s will.  Having infrequent rather than frequent contacts also
27:1021:84586:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces the likelihood of inclusion by 14–15 percentage points, but, as indicated by the
27:1022:84674:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:p-values at the bottom of the table, the difference between having infrequent contacts and
27:1023:84764:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:having no contact is always statistically significant.  These results do not change when we
27:1024:84855:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:add controls for child’s income and other parent-child interaction terms (e.g., grandchild’s
27:1025:84947:18:18:70:227:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:care and inter vivos transfers).
27:1026:84979:18:18:88:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find that the “no-contact genetic child penalty” is fully offset if the child is the main
27:1027:85071:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recipient of inter vivos transfers.  This might reflect earlier (more frequent) interactions.
27:1028:85164:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Similarly,  if  the  no-contact  child  is  a  female,  her  penalty  is  reduced  by  60–90  percent,
27:1029:85266:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perhaps reflecting the flow of other services expected by the parent but not observed in
27:1030:85354:18:18:70:117:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the HRS.
27:1031:85362:18:18:88:524:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  columns  (c)  and  (d)  we  explore  how  the  child’s  odds  of  being  mentioned  in  the
27:1032:85457:18:18:70:524:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will  change  not  only  when  the  child  has  infrequent  or  no  contact  with  the  parent  but
27:1033:85556:18:19:70:524:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also if he/she is not the genetic child of the parent’s partner and if the parent expects
27:1034:85645:19:16:80:524:108:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:37Due  to  small  sample  size  we  could  not  estimate  a  specification  which  included  the  within-family
27:1035:85756:16:11:70:524:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:coefficient of variation in children’s income.  We thus cannot use the estimates in Table 11 to assess the
27:1036:85862:11:0:70:173:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:role played by altruism.
28:1037:85888:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to receive help from him/her in the future.  We find that, if the no-contact child is also
28:1038:85978:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetically  unrelated  to  the  parent’s  partner,  his/her  probability  of  being  included  in
28:1039:86076:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  will  is  further  reduced  by  8  percentage  points  (column  (c)).   This  means  that  for
28:1040:86175:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no-contact stepchildren the odds of inclusion are essentially reduced to zero.  As before,
28:1041:86265:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:being the main recipient of inter vivos transfers and being a female will reduce the penalty
28:1042:86357:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantially but will not eliminate it entirely.  Expecting help from the absent child in
28:1043:86447:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the future does not significantly affect the likelihood of mentioning him/her in the will
28:1044:86536:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(column (d)).  This suggests that parents do not anticipate receiving any help from genetic
28:1045:86627:18:18:70:326:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children with whom they have no regular contact.
28:1046:86675:18:18:88:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we explore how the lack of contact interacts with the absence of a relationship
28:1047:86763:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the parent’s partner as well as with the parent’s expectation of receiving help in the
28:1048:86854:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future (column (e)).  If parents expect to receive help from their absent genetic children
28:1049:86944:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the future, the probability that such children are included in the will increases by 39
28:1050:87034:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points.  This more than offsets the penalty of having no contact.  However, if
28:1051:87123:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the parent formed a new family and the absent child is not related to the parent’s new
28:1052:87209:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:partner/spouse,  the chances that the absent child is mentioned in the will are reduced
28:1053:87296:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by 28 percentage points, leading to an absent-child penalty of about 17 points, almost 40
28:1054:87385:18:18:70:248:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the baseline probability.
28:1055:87421:18:19:88:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We also conducted this analysis separately for male and female children, the results
28:1056:87505:19:18:70:524:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  which  are  shown  in  web  appendix.   These  estimates  broadly  confirm  the  results  in
28:1057:87601:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 11, with effects that are generally similar for sons and daughters.  However, women
28:1058:87690:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(but not men) who are not the genetic children of the parent’s partner face an additional
28:1059:87779:18:18:70:359:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:penalty only if they have no contacts with their parents.
28:1060:87836:18:18:88:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, parents are more likely to transfer resources to children who share their genes
28:1061:87923:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than to stepchildren who are genetically unrelated to them.  But a simple evolutionary
28:1062:88009:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:story, such as the genetic-child hypothesis, does not explain what we observe in the data
28:1063:88098:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as, for example, in the case of no-contact parents.  Furthermore, bequests to stepchildren
28:1064:88188:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are affected by altruistic and exchange motives.  Parents are likely to leave bequests to
28:1065:88277:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their low-income stepchildren suggesting altruistic motives.  And stepchildren are more
28:1066:88364:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely to be mentioned in their stepparents’ wills if the stepparents are older suggesting
28:1067:88454:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exchange  motives.   Trust  and  bonding  seem  to  be  highly  relevant  within  all  complex
28:1068:88548:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families:  there is no stepchild penalty if stepparents help with child care or have already
28:1069:88640:18:18:70:524:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:made other transfers.  Similar patterns occur between parents and their no-contact genetic
28:1070:88730:18:18:70:524:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children.  The relationship between stepchildren and parents in complex families requires
28:1071:88819:18:0:70:510:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deeper, more subtle explanations than those provided by the genetic-child hypothesis.
29:1072:88906:0:26:70:140:759:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6.  Theory
29:1073:88916:26:18:70:524:733:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here we provide a simple framework to interpret the results of the previous two sections.
29:1074:89005:18:18:70:524:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We borrow our key insights from the work by Behrman, Pollak and Taubman (1982, 1986,
29:1075:89089:18:18:70:101:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1995).
29:1076:89095:18:18:88:524:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Consider a family comprised of one older parent (e.g., the surviving spouse) and two
29:1077:89179:18:18:70:524:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children,  childgwho  is  her  genetic  child  and  childswho  is  her  stepchild.38Suppose
29:1078:89270:18:19:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the parent has a separable welfare function defined over expected bequests for each child,
29:1079:89360:19:18:70:524:624:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:W(Bg,Bs).  The parent maximizesWsubject to three constraints.  The first constraint is
29:1080:89446:18:18:70:524:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the budget constraint that applies to resources devoted to bequests.  Such resources are
29:1081:89534:18:18:70:524:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:denoted byR, while investments are denoted byH.  Assume the parent faces a fixed price
29:1082:89620:18:18:70:524:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for investments and the price is identical for both children.  Normalizing the investment
29:1083:89709:18:18:70:355:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price to 1, we can write the constraint asHg+Hs≤R.
29:1084:89759:18:18:88:524:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  other  two  constrains  are  the  bequest  production  functions,  one  for  each  child.
29:1085:89853:18:18:70:523:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:One of the arguments of these functions is bequest-related investments,H, which include
29:1086:89940:18:18:70:524:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the full history of each child’s health and human capital investments as well as material
29:1087:90029:18:18:70:524:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:help  and  money  transfers  that  the  parents  have  made  over  their  children’s  lives  and
29:1088:90125:18:18:70:524:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that,  in  turn,  might  depend  on  child  attributes,  such  as  age  and  sex.   Child-specific
29:1089:90223:18:18:70:524:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income  and  family  circumstances  are  also  determinants  of  such  investments.   Another
29:1090:90316:18:18:70:523:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:argument,  labeledP,  comprises  bequest-relevant  parental  characteristics,  such  as  age,
29:1091:90409:18:18:70:524:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sex,  marital  status,  health,  income,  and  wealth.   A  final  category,  labeledT,  includes
29:1092:90506:18:18:70:524:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables that determine the trust relationship between each child and the parent.  This
29:1093:90594:18:18:70:524:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:takes account of physical proximity, contact, and bonding between parent and child, and is
29:1094:90684:18:18:70:524:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:signaled by and shaped by repeated interactions and relative bargaining powers.  Putting
29:1095:90772:18:19:70:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:together these arguments leads us to a child-specific bequest production function of the

29:1097:90885:18:18:88:524:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Provided the constrained maximization faced by the parent has an interior solution,

29:1113:91305:36:18:70:524:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This expression, which does not include the unobservableλ, corresponds to the standard

30:1116:91590:18:19:70:524:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function  equals  the  slope  of  the  bequest  possibility  frontier  for  childsversus  childg.
30:1117:91687:19:18:70:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is illustrated by pointAin Figure 6.  In this figure,  we assume equal concern for
30:1118:91774:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both children, so the indifference curves are symmetrical around the 45 degree line from
30:1119:91862:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the origin.  If we also assume a symmetric bequest possibility frontier, these assumptions
30:1120:91952:18:18:70:308:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imply equal bequests in equilibrium,B∗g=B∗s.
30:1121:91996:18:18:88:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Because  in  the  previous  two  sections  we  found  strong  evidence  of  unequal  bequest
30:1122:92088:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intentions  that  favor  genetic  children  over  stepchildren,  we  consider  changes  in  the  as-
30:1123:92188:18:18:70:524:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sumptions underlying Figure 6.  A straightforward change is to allow for unequal concern.
30:1124:92277:18:18:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, stepparents may expect stepchildren to care less efficiently for them, or may
30:1125:92368:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anticipate that stepchildren can also rely on their nonresidental biological parents for help
30:1126:92461:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and support.  This case is illustrated in Figure 7, with parental preferences favoring the
30:1127:92551:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:child genetically linked to the parent, that is childg.  If the production possibility frontier
30:1128:92646:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remains symmetric, a parent with unequal concern favoring the genetic child will divide
30:1129:92733:18:18:70:331:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estates unequally, in such a way thatB∗g> B∗s.
30:1130:92783:18:18:88:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another departure from the benchmark of Figure 6 is through a change in the produc-
30:1131:92866:18:18:70:524:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion possibility frontier, while keeping the assumption of equal concern.  Parents might
30:1132:92954:18:18:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have skewed bequest related investments in favor of their genetic children, or genetic chil-
30:1133:93046:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren might have greater bargaining power (emotional capital) toward their parents than
30:1134:93132:19:18:70:523:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchildren do.  PointE∗in Figure 8 illustrates this case.  Clearly, if parents also have
30:1135:93222:18:18:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unequal  concern  favoring  their  genetic  children,  then  the  bequest  division  between  the
30:1136:93319:18:18:70:524:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepchild and the genetic child could be even more unequal, as illustrated by pointE′in
30:1137:93406:18:18:70:122:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the figure.
30:1138:93417:18:18:88:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The results in subsection 5.D suggest that the situation is less unfavorable to stepchil-
30:1139:93506:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dren  if  there  is  greater  bonding  and  trust  between  them  and  their  stepparents  and  if
30:1140:93604:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stepparents have greater access to the stepchildren’s family-specific capital.  This bonding
30:1141:93696:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  trust  is  signaled  and  fostered  by  the  stepparent  providing  care  for  the  stepchild’s
30:1142:93796:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children or making direct transfers to the stepchild.  When this happens, the bequest pos-
30:1143:93886:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sibility frontier can shift and the household will reach the new equilibriumE′′in Figure
30:1144:93974:18:39:70:291:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:8 (under the assumption of equal concern).
30:1145:94016:39:26:70:167:196:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7.  Conclusion
30:1146:94030:26:18:70:524:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the last thirty years, American families have experienced massive changes:  a retreat
30:1147:94118:18:18:70:524:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from marriage,  increased divorce and remarriage,  and growth in cohabitation and non-
30:1148:94204:18:18:70:524:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marital childbearing.  Stepparents and no-contact parents in complex families may be less
30:1149:94293:18:18:70:524:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:motivated than parents in traditional families to provide resources to children with whom
30:1150:94382:18:18:70:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they do not share their genes or have not shared their homes.  And children in complex
30:1151:94468:18:0:70:524:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:families may be less willing than children in traditional families to assist disabled older
31:1152:94561:0:18:70:524:759:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parents, especially those with whom they have no genetic connection or only briefly shared
31:1153:94651:18:19:70:110:741:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a home.
31:1154:94658:19:18:88:524:722:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For  younger  cohorts,  nonmarital  fertility  of  cohabiting  couples  who  break  up  and
31:1155:94749:18:18:70:524:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:repartner  will  substantially  increase  the  prevalence  of  complex  families.   Those  in  the
31:1156:94847:18:18:70:524:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HRS cohort are older, and their complex families are generally a by-product of divorce
31:1157:94933:18:18:70:524:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and remarriage.  The implications for intergenerational transfers of these changes in family
31:1158:95025:18:18:70:524:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structure  are  difficult  to  predict  because  complex  families  created  by  cohabitation  and
31:1159:95123:18:18:70:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nonmarital  fertility  in  younger  cohorts  may  behave  differently  from  those  created  by
31:1160:95218:18:18:70:275:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:divorce and remarriage in older cohorts.
31:1161:95258:18:18:88:524:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  have  shown  that  bequests  are  much  more  unequal  now  than  in  the  recent  past
31:1162:95349:18:18:70:524:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and much more unequal than generally recognized.  In simple families (i.e., families with
31:1163:95438:18:18:70:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:neither stepchildren nor no-contact children), equal bequests are the dominant pattern.  In
31:1164:95529:18:18:70:524:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complex families, however, we find substantial inequality in both bequest intentions and
31:1165:95617:18:18:70:524:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actual bequests.  We cannot assess the relative importance of genetic ties and contact by
31:1166:95706:18:18:70:524:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studying simple families because in such families all of the children have the same genetic
31:1167:95797:18:18:70:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ties with their parents.  But the bequest patterns we find in complex families imply that
31:1168:95886:18:18:70:212:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact trumps genetic ties.
31:1169:95914:18:18:88:524:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The economics literature on end-of-life transfers assumes that individuals, or at least
31:1170:96001:18:19:70:524:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:older individuals, make wills.  We find instead that parents often fail to write wills and,

31:1174:96361:18:18:70:524:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contact parents, the effect of relying on intestacy law is to treat contact and no-contact
31:1175:96451:18:18:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:genetic children equally.  If parents understand the most basic provisions of intestacy law,
31:1176:96543:18:18:70:524:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this finding is puzzling.  It implies that parents who have had no contact with some of
31:1177:96630:18:18:70:524:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their genetic children are more likely to treat all of their genetic children equally than
31:1178:96720:18:18:70:524:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are parents who have maintained contact with all of their genetic children.  We suspect
31:1179:96807:18:18:70:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the absence of wills reflects the disutility of making wills (and contemplating death)
31:1180:96898:18:18:70:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than preferences for the distribution mandated by intestacy law.  Unfortunately,
31:1181:96985:18:18:70:524:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HRS provides no evidence that speaks to this issue.  Regardless of parents’ motivations
31:1182:97072:18:18:70:524:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for not making wills, we have shown that focusing exclusively on bequest intentions (i.e.,
31:1183:97162:18:18:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on parents who make wills) provides an incomplete and misleading picture of end-of-life
