2:28:1414:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:The  massive  expansion  of  central-bank  balance  sheets  in  response  to  recent  crises  raises 
2:29:1515:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:important questions about the effects of such "quantitative easing" policies, both their effects on 
2:30:1614:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:financial  conditions and  on  aggregate  demand  (the  intended  effects  of  the  policies),  and  their 
2:31:1720:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:possible  collateral  effects on  financial  stability.  The  present  paper  compares  three  alternative 
2:32:1826:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:dimensions  of  central  bank  policy —  conventional  interest-rate  policy,  increases  in  the  central 
2:33:1932:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:bank's  supply  of  safe  (monetary)  liabilities, and  macroprudential  policy  (possibly  implemented 
2:34:2035:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:through  discretionary  changes  in  reserve  requirements) —  showing  in  the  context  of  a  simple 
2:35:2138:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:intertemporal  general-equilibrium  model  why  they  are  logically independent  dimensions  of 
2:36:2234:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:variation  in  policy,  and  how  they  jointly  determine  financial  conditions, aggregate  demand,  and 
2:37:2340:14:14:71:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:the  severity  of  the  risks  associated  with  a  funding  crisis  in  the  banking  sector. In  the  proposed 
2:38:2452:14:14:71:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:?:model, each of the three dimensions of policy can be used independently to influence aggregate 
2:39:2546:14:14:71:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:?:demand,  and  in  each  case  a  more  stimulative  policy  also  increases  financial  stability  risk. 
2:40:2650:14:14:71:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:?:However,  the  policies  are  not  equivalent,  and  in  particular  the  relative  magnitudes  of  the  two 
2:41:2759:14:14:71:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:?:kinds of effects are not the same. Quantitative easing policies increase financial stability risk (in 
2:42:2860:14:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:?:the absence of an offsetting tightening of macroprudential policy), but they actually increase such 
2:43:2959:14:14:72:546:378:12:Times:12:Times:?:risk  less  than either  of  the  other  two  policies,  relative  to  the  magnitude  of  aggregate  demand 
2:44:3067:14:14:72:546:364:12:Times:12:Times:?:stimulus;  and  a  combination of  expansion  of  the  central  bank's  balance  sheet  with  a  suitable 
2:45:3172:14:14:72:546:350:12:Times:12:Times:?:tightening  of  macroprudential  policy can  have  a  net  expansionary  effect  on  aggregate  demand 
2:46:3274:14:14:72:545:336:12:Times:12:Times:?:with no increased risk to financial stability. This suggests that quantitative easing policies may be 
2:47:3375:14:14:71:545:322:12:Times:12:Times:?:useful  as  an  approach  to  aggregate  demand  management not  only  when  the  zero  lower  bound 
2:48:3475:14:14:71:545:308:12:Times:12:Times:?:precludes  further  use  of  conventional  interest-rate  policy,  but also  when  it  is  not  desirable  to 
2:49:3584:14:42:71:392:294:12:Times:12:Times:?:further reduce interest rates because of financial stability concerns.

3:57:3776:0:18:111:525:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Since  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008-09,  many  of  the  leading  central  banks
3:58:3867:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have  dramatically  increased  the  size  of  their  balance  sheets,  and  also  have  shifted
3:59:3962:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the composition of the assets that they hold, toward greater holdings of longer-term
3:60:4046:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securities (as well as toward assets that are riskier in other respects).  While many
3:61:4131:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have hailed these policies as contributing significantly to contain the degree of damage
3:62:4219:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to both the countries’ financial systems and real economies resulting from the collapse
3:63:4306:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of confidence in certain types of risky assets, the policies have also been and remain
3:64:4392:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quite controversial.  One of the concerns raised by skeptics has been the suggestion
3:65:4476:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that such “quantitative easing” by central banks may have been supporting countries’
3:66:4560:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:banking systems and aggregate demand only by encouraging risk-taking by ultimate
3:67:4640:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers and by financial intermediaries of a kind that increases the risk of precisely
3:68:4728:17:17:93:513:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sort of destructive financial crisis that had led these policies to be introduced.
3:69:4814:17:18:111:525:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The most basic argument for suspecting that such policies create risks to financial
3:70:4897:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stability is simply that, according to proponents of these policies in the central banks
3:71:4985:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., Bernanke, 2012), they represent alternative means of achieving the same kind
3:72:5068:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of relaxation of financial conditions that would under more ordinary circumstances
3:73:5150:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be achieved by lowering the central bank’s operating target for short-term interest
3:74:5233:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates — but a means that continues to be available even when short-term nominal
3:75:5312:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest  rates  have  already  reached  their  effective  lower  bound,  and  so  cannot  be
3:76:5405:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lowered to provide further stimulus.  If one believes that cuts in short-term interest
3:77:5491:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates have as a collateral effect — or perhaps even as the main channel through which
3:78:5576:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they affect aggregate demand, as argued by Adrian and Shin (2010) — an increase
3:79:5655:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the degree to which intermediaries take more highly leveraged positions in risky
3:80:5738:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets, increasing the likelihood of and/or severity of a potential financial crisis, then
3:81:5828:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one might suppose that to the extent that quantitative easing policies are effective
3:82:5912:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in relaxing financial conditions in order to stimulate aggregate demand, they should
3:83:5996:17:17:93:317:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similarly increase risks to financial stability.
3:84:6044:17:18:111:525:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One might go further and argue that such policies relax financial conditions by
3:85:6123:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increasing  the  supply  of  central-bank  reserves,1and  one  might  suppose  that  such
3:86:6212:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an  increase  in  the  availability  of  reserves  matters  for  financial  conditions  precisely
3:87:6309:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:because it relaxes a constraint on the extent to which private financial intermediaries
3:88:6396:18:18:107:524:169:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1The  term  “quantitative  easing,”  originally  introduced  by  the  Bank  of  Japan  to  describe  the
3:89:6500:18:15:93:524:151:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:policy that it adopted in 2001 in attempt to stem the deflationary slump that Japan had suffered in
3:90:6599:15:14:93:524:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the aftermath of the collapse of an asset bubble in the early 1990s, refers precisely to the intention to
3:91:6704:14:14:93:524:122:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:increase the monetary base (and hence, it was hoped, the money supply more broadly) by increasing
3:92:6801:14:31:93:190:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the supply of reserves.
3:93:6824:31:0:299:305:77:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:?:1
4:94:6825:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can issue money-like liabilities (that are subject to reserve requirements) as a way
4:95:6909:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of financing their acquisition of more risky and less liquid assets, as in the model of
4:96:6996:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Stein (2012).  Under this view of the mechanism by which quantitative easing works,
4:97:7079:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one might suppose that it should be even more inevitably linked to an increase in
4:98:7160:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability risk than expansionary interest-rate policy (which, after all, might
4:99:7248:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also  increase  aggregate  demand  through  channels  that  do  not  rely  upon  increased
4:100:7338:17:18:93:205:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risk-taking by banks).
4:101:7360:18:17:111:525:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  some  may  be  particularly  suspicious  of  quantitative  easing  policies  on
4:102:7449:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the ground that these policies,  unlike conventional interest-rate policy,  relax finan-
4:103:7537:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cial conditions primarily by reducing the risk premia earned by holding longer-term
4:104:7620:18:17:93:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securities, rather than by lowering the expected path of the risk-free rate.2Such a
4:105:7703:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:departure  from  the  normal  historical  pattern  of  risk  premia  as  a  result  of  massive
4:106:7798:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:central-bank purchases may seem a cause for alarm.  If one thinks that the premia
4:107:7879:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that exist when market pricing is not “distorted” by the central bank’s intervention
4:108:7963:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide an important signal of the degree of risk that exists in the marketplace, one
4:109:8048:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:might fear that central-bank actions that suppress this signal — not by actually re-
4:110:8132:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ducing the underlying risks, but only by preventing them from being reflected so fully
4:111:8218:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in market prices — run the danger of distorting perceptions of risk in a way that will
4:112:8304:17:18:93:255:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:encourage excessive risk-taking.
4:113:8336:18:17:111:525:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The present paper considers the extent to which these are valid grounds for concern
4:114:8419:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about the use of this policy tool by central banks, by analyzing further the mechanisms
4:115:8506:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:just sketched, in the context of an explicit model of the way in which quantitative
4:116:8589:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing policies influence financial conditions, and the way in which monetary policies
4:117:8675:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more generally affect the incentives of financial intermediaries to engage in maturity
4:118:8761:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and liquidity transformation of a kind that increases the risk of financial crisis.  It
4:119:8848:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:argues, in fact, that the concerns just raised are of little merit.  But it does not reach
4:120:8938:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this conclusion by challenging the view that quantitative easing policies can indeed
4:121:9022:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectively relax financial conditions (and so achieve effects on aggregate demand that
4:122:9109:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are similar to the effects of conventional interest-rate policy); nor does it deny that
4:123:9196:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risks to financial stability are an appropriate concern of monetary policy deliberations,
4:124:9285:17:19:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or that expansionary interest-rate policy tends to increase such risks (among other

4:126:9463:18:14:93:524:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:discusses the possibility of effects of quantitative easing that result from central-bank actions being
4:127:9566:14:0:93:404:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:taken to signal different intentions regarding future interest-rate policy.
5:128:9642:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects).  The model developed here is one in which risk-taking by the financial sector
5:129:9729:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can easily be excessive (in the sense that a restriction on banks’ ability to engage in
5:130:9816:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:liquidity transformation to the degree that they choose to under laissez-faire would
5:131:9900:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:raise welfare);  in which, when that is true, a reduction in short-term interest rates
5:132:9986:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through central-bank action will worsen the problem by making it even more tempting
5:133:10069:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for  banks  to  finance  acquisitions  of  risky,  illiquid  assets  by  issuing  short-term  safe
5:134:10167:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:liabilities; and in which the purchase of longer-term and/or risky assets by the central
5:135:10255:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank,  financed  by  creating  additional  reserves  (or  other  short-term  safe  liabilities,
5:136:10350:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such as reverse repos or central-bank bills, that would also be useful in facilitating
5:137:10436:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transactions),  will  indeed  loosen  financial  conditions,  with  an  effect  on  aggregate
5:138:10529:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand that is similar, though not identical to, the effect of a reduction in the central
5:139:10618:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank’s operating target for its policy rate.  Nonetheless, we show that quantitative
5:140:10702:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing policies should not increase risks to financial stability, and should instead tend
5:141:10791:18:17:93:174:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to reduce them.
5:142:10806:17:17:111:525:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The reason for this different conclusion hinges on our conception of the sources
5:143:10886:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the kind of financial fragility that allowed a crisis of the kind just experienced to
5:144:10974:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occur, and the way in which monetary policy can affect the incentives to create a more
5:145:11060:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fragile financial structure.  In our view, the fragility that led to the recent crisis was
5:146:11150:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:greatly enhanced by the notable increase in maturity and liquidity transformation in
5:147:11234:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the financial sector in the years immediately prior to the crisis (Brunnermeier, 2009;
5:148:11320:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Adrian and Shin, 2010) — in particular, the significant increase in funding of financial
5:149:11408:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intermediaries by issuance of collateralized short-term debt, such as repos (financing
5:150:11494:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment banks) or asset-backed commercial paper (issued by SIVs). Such financing
5:151:11577:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is relatively inexpensive, in the sense that investors will hold such instruments even
5:152:11663:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when they promise a relatively low yield, because of the assurance they provide that
5:153:11747:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the investor can be sure of payment and can withdraw their funds at any time on short
5:154:11832:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:notice if desired.  But too much of it is dangerous, because it exposes the leveraged
5:155:11917:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:institution to funding risk, which may require abrupt de-leveraging through a “fire
5:156:12000:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sale”  of  relatively  illiquid  assets.   The  sudden  need  to  sell  relatively  illiquid  assets
5:157:12100:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in order to cover a shortfall of funding can substantially depress the price of those
5:158:12185:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets,  requiring  even  more  de-leveraging  and  leading  to  a  “margin  spiral”  of  the
5:159:12278:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:kind described by Shleifer and Vishny (1992, 2010) and Brunnermeier and Pederson
5:160:12358:17:17:93:129:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2009).
5:161:12365:17:0:111:525:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It  is  important  to  ask  why  such  fragile  financial  structures  should  arise  as  an
6:162:12458:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium phenomenon, in order to understand how monetary policy may increase
6:163:12537:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or decrease the likely degree of fragility.  According to the perspective that we adopt
6:164:12624:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:here, investors are attracted to the short-term safe liabilities created by banks or other
6:165:12714:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial  intermediaries  because  assets  with  a  value  that  is  completely  certain  are
6:166:12808:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more widely accepted as a means of payment.3If an insufficient quantity of such safe
6:167:12892:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets are supplied by the government (through means that we discuss further below),
6:168:12976:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investors will pay a “money premium” for privately-issued short-term safe instruments
6:169:13061:18:17:93:525:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with this feature, as documented by Greenwoodet al.(2010), Krishnamurthy and
6:170:13137:17:17:93:525:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Vissing-Jorgensen (2012),  and Carlsonet al.(2014).  This provides banks with an
6:171:13217:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incentive to obtain a larger fraction of their financing in this way.  Moreover, they may
6:172:13306:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:choose an excessive amount of this kind of financing, despite the funding risk to which
6:173:13393:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it exposes them, because each individual bank fails to internalize the effects of their
6:174:13480:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:collective financing decisions on the degree to which asset prices will be depressed in
6:175:13567:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the event of a “fire sale.”  This gives rise to a pecuniary externality,  as a result of
6:176:13655:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which excessive risk is taken in equilibrium (Lorenzoni, 2008;  Jeanne and Korinek,
6:177:13738:17:18:93:188:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2010; Stein, 2012).
6:178:13757:18:17:111:525:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Conventional  monetary  policy,  which  cuts  short-term  nominal  interest  rates  in
6:179:13843:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:response to an aggregate demand shortfall, can arguably exacerbate this problem, as
6:180:13926:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:low market yields on short-term safe instruments will further increase the incentive
6:181:14010:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for private issuance of liabilities of this kind (Adrian and Shin, 2010;  Giavazzi and
6:182:14096:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Giovannini, 2012).  The question of primary concern in this paper is, do quantitative
6:183:14181:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing policies, pursued as a means of providing economic stimulus when conventional
6:184:14265:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound on short-term nominal interest
6:185:14345:17:17:93:393:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates, increase financial stability risks for a similar reason?
6:186:14408:17:18:111:525:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the model proposed here, quantitative easing policies lower the equilibrium real
6:187:14491:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yield on longer-term and risky government liabilities, just as a cut in the central bank’s
6:188:14581:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:target for the short-term riskless rate will, and this relaxation of financial conditions
6:189:14670:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has a similar expansionary effect on aggregate demand in both cases.  Nonetheless,
6:190:14752:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the consequences for financial stability are not the same.  In the case of conventional
6:191:14839:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monetary policy, a reduction in the riskless rate lowers the equilibrium yield on risky
6:192:14926:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets  as  well  because,  if  it  did  not,  the  increased  spread  between  the  two  yields
6:193:15022:18:18:107:524:169:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3The role of non-state-contingent payoffs in allowing an asset to be widely acceptable as a means
6:194:15119:18:15:93:524:151:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of payment is stressed in particular by Gorton and Pennacchi (2010), and in recent discussions such
6:195:15218:15:0:93:355:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:as Gorton (2010) and Gorton, Lewellen and Metrick (2012).
7:196:15276:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would  provide  an  increased  incentive  for  maturity  and  liquidity  transformation  on
7:197:15367:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the part of banks, which they pursue until a point at which the spread has decreased
7:198:15451:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(because  of  diminishing  returns  to  further  investment  in  risky  assets)  to  where  it
7:199:15545:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  again  balanced  by  the  risks  associated  with  overly  leveraged  investment.   (This
7:200:15638:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occurs, in equilibrium, partly through a reduction in the degree to which the spread
7:201:15722:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases — which means that the expected return on risky assets is reduced — and
7:202:15803:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:partly  through  an  increase  in  the  risk  of  a  costly  “fire  sale”  liquidation  of  assets.)
7:203:15903:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the case of quantitative easing, instead, the equilibrium return on risky assets is
7:204:15989:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduced, but in this case through a reduction, rather than an increase in the spread
7:205:16073:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the two yields.  The “money premium,” which results from a scarcity of safe
7:206:16156:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets, should be reduced if the central-bank asset purchases increase the supply of
7:207:16240:17:17:93:525:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:safe assets to the public, as argued by Caballero and Farhi (2013) and Carlsonet al.
7:208:16324:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2014).  Hence the incentives for creation of a more fragile financial structure are not
7:209:16412:18:17:93:425:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased as much by expansionary monetary policy of this kind.
7:210:16475:17:17:111:525:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The idea that quantitative easing policies, when pursued as an additional means
7:211:16554:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of stimulus when the risk-free rate is at the zero lower bound, should increase risks to
7:212:16642:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability because they are analogous to an expansionary policy that relaxes
7:213:16727:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reserve  requirements  on  private  issuers  of  money-like  liabilities  is  also  based  on  a
7:214:16823:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flawed analogy.  It is true, in the model of endogenous financial stability risk presented
7:215:16913:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:here,  that  a  relaxation  of  a  reserve  requirement  proportional  to  banks’  issuance  of
7:216:17008:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:short-term  safe  liabilities  will  (in  the  case  that  the  constraint  binds)  increase  the
7:217:17105:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:degree to which excessive liquidity transformation occurs.  And it is also true that in
7:218:17192:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a conventional textbook account of the way in which monetary policy affects financial
7:219:17277:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions,  an  increase  in  the  supply  of  reserves  by  the  central  bank  relaxes  the
7:220:17371:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint  on  banks’  issuance  of  additional  money-like  liabilities  (“inside  money”)
7:221:17463:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implied  by  the  reserve  requirement,  so  that  the  means  through  which  the  central
7:222:17554:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank  implements  a  reduction  in  the  riskless  short-term  interest  rate  is  essentially
7:223:17648:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equivalent to a reduction in the reduction in the reserve requirement.  However, this
7:224:17733:18:17:93:525:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:isnota channel through which quantitative easing policies can be effective, when the
7:225:17817:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risk-free rate has already fallen to zero (or more generally, to the level of interest paid
7:226:17908:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on reserves).  For in such a case, reserves are necessarily already in sufficiently great
7:227:17997:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:supply for banks to be satiated in reserves, so that the opportunity cost of holding
7:228:18081:17:17:93:524:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them must fall to zero in order for the existing supply to be voluntarily held.  Under
7:229:18167:17:0:93:524:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such  circumstances  (which  is  to  say,  those  existing  in  countries  like  the  US  since

8:231:18347:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behavior.  Hence, to the extent that quantitative easing policies are of any use at the
8:232:18434:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:zero lower bound on short-term interest rates, their effects cannot occur through this
8:233:18520:17:18:93:193:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:traditional channel.
8:234:18540:18:17:111:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  the  model  presented  here,  quantitative  easingiseffective  at  the  zero  lower

8:239:18988:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduces the equilibrium “money premium.”  But whereas a relaxation of a binding
8:240:19067:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reserve requirement would increase banks’ issuance of short-term safe liabilities (and
8:241:19153:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hence  financial  stability  risk),  a  reduction  in  the  “money  premium”  should  reduce
8:242:19245:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their issuance of such liabilities, so that financial stability risk should if anything be
8:243:19335:18:17:93:136:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduced.
8:244:19343:17:17:111:525:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The idea that a reduction in risk premia as a result of central-bank balance-sheet

8:246:19509:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  the  model  presented  here,  quantitative  easing  achieves  its  effects  (both  on  the

8:248:19683:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the equilibrium risk premium — that is, the spread between the required return on
8:249:19764:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risky assets and the riskless rate.  But this does not imply the creation of conditions
8:250:19851:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:under which it should be more tempting for banks to take on greater risk.  To the
8:251:19932:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contrary, the existence of a smaller spread between the expected return on risky assets
8:252:20019:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the risk-free rate makes it less tempting to finance purchases of risky assets by
8:253:20104:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issuing safe, highly liquid short-term liabilities that need pay only the riskless rate.
8:254:20192:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence again a correct analysis implies that quantitative easing policies should increase
8:255:20280:18:17:93:324:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability, rather than threatening it.

8:263:20935:17:0:93:524:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of alternative balance-sheet policies on equilibrium variables, focusing on

9:271:21589:29:18:93:524:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This section develops a simple model of monetary equilibrium, in which it is possible
9:272:21674:18:17:93:524:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simultaneously to consider the effects of the central bank’s balance sheet on financial
9:273:21761:17:17:93:524:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions (most notably, the equilibrium spread between the expected rate of return
9:274:21845:17:18:93:524:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on risky assets and the risk-free rate of interest) and the way in which private banks’
9:275:21932:18:17:93:524:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financing decisions can increase risks to financial stability.  An important goal of the
9:276:22020:17:17:93:524:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysis is to present a sufficiently explicit model of the objectives and constraints
9:277:22106:17:18:93:524:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of individual actors to allow welfare analysis of the equilibria associated with alter-
9:278:22193:18:17:93:524:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:native policies that is based on the degree of satisfaction of the individual objectives
9:279:22281:17:17:93:524:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:underlying  the  behavior  assumed  in  the  model,  as  in  the  modern  theory  of  public
9:280:22373:17:18:93:524:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:finance, rather than judging alternative equilibria on the basis of some more ad hoc

9:282:22468:17:18:111:525:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Risks  to  financial  stability  are  modeled  using  a  slightly  adapted  version  of  the
9:283:22560:18:17:93:524:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model proposed by Stein (2012).  The Stein model is a three-period model in which
9:284:22641:17:17:93:524:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:banks finance their investments in risky assets in the first period; a crisis may occur in
9:285:22731:17:18:93:524:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the second period, in which banks are unable to roll over their short-term financing
9:286:22815:18:17:93:524:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  as  a  result  may  have  to  sell  illiquid  risky  assets  in  a  “fire  sale”;  and  in  the
9:287:22915:17:17:93:524:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:third period, the ultimate value of the risky assets is determined.  The present model
9:288:23001:17:18:93:524:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incorporates this model of financial contracting and occasional fire sales of assets into
9:289:23090:18:17:93:524:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a fairly standard intertemporal general-equilibrium model of the demand for money-
9:290:23172:17:17:93:524:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:like  assets,  the  “cash-in-advance”  model  of  Lucas  and  Stokey  (1987).   In  this  way,
9:291:23266:17:18:93:524:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the premium earned by money-like assets, that is treated as an exogenous parameter
9:292:23348:18:18:93:524:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Stein (2012),  can be endogenized,  and the effects of central-bank policy on this
9:293:23433:18:18:107:524:164:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4The proposed framework is further developed in Sergeyev (2016), which considers the interaction
9:294:23529:18:14:93:524:146:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:between conventional monetary policy and country-specific macroprudential policies in a currency
9:295:23625:14:0:93:120:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:union.
10:296:23632:0:39:93:515:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variable can be analyzed, and through this the consequences for financial stability.

10:298:23744:25:17:93:524:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Like most general-equilibrium models of monetary exchange, the Lucas and Stokey
10:299:23823:17:17:93:524:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1987) model is an infinite-horizon model, in which the willingness of sellers to accept
10:300:23911:17:18:93:524:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:central-bank liabilities as payment for real goods and services in any period depends
10:301:23996:18:17:93:524:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the expectation of being able to use those instruments as a means of payment in
10:302:24078:17:17:93:524:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:further  transactions  in  future  periods.   The  state  space  of  the  model  is  kept  small
10:303:24174:17:18:93:524:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(allowing  a  straightforward  characterization  of  equilibrium,  despite  random  distur-
10:304:24265:18:17:93:524:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bances each period) by assuming a representative household structure; the two sides
10:305:24348:17:17:93:524:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of each transaction involving payment using cash are assumed to be two members of
10:306:24429:17:18:93:524:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a household unit with a common objective, that can be thought of as a “worker” and
10:307:24511:18:17:93:524:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a “shopper.”  During each period,  the worker and shopper from a given household
10:308:24591:17:17:93:524:470:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have separate budget constraints (so that cash received by the worker as payment for
10:309:24675:17:18:93:524:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sale of produced goods cannot be immediately used by the shopper to purchase
10:310:24755:18:17:93:524:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods, in the same market), as is necessary for the “cash-in-advance” constraint to
10:311:24838:17:17:93:524:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matter; but at the end of the period, their funds are again pooled in a single house-

10:313:25007:18:17:93:253:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identical, matter at this point).
10:314:25040:17:17:111:525:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We shall employ a similar device, but further increasing the number of distinct
10:315:25119:17:18:93:524:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:roles for different members of the household, in order to introduce additional kinds
10:316:25203:18:17:93:524:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  financial  constraints  into  the  model,  while  retaining  the  convenience  of  a  repre-
10:317:25299:17:17:93:524:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sentative household.  We suppose that each infinite-lived household is made of four
10:318:25382:17:18:93:524:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:members with different roles during the period:  a “worker” who supplies the inputs
10:319:25465:18:17:93:524:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:used to produce all final goods, and receives the income from the sale of these goods;
10:320:25551:17:17:93:524:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a “shopper” who purchases “regular goods” for consumption by the household, and
10:321:25630:17:18:93:524:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:who holds the household’s cash balance, for use in such transactions; a “banker” who
10:322:25714:18:17:93:524:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:buys  risky  durable  goods,  and  issues  short-term  safe  liabilities  in  order  to  finance
10:323:25810:17:17:93:524:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some of these purchases; and an “investor” who purchases “special” final goods, and
10:324:25893:17:18:93:524:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can also bid for the risky durables sold by bankers in the event of a fire sale.5As

10:327:26172:14:15:93:524:143:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:In the Stein model, these three types of agents are distinct individuals with no sharing of resources
10:328:26273:15:0:93:524:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:among them, rather than members of a single (larger) household; the device of having them pool

11:330:26448:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraints during the period (which is the significance of referring to them as differ-
11:331:26536:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ent people), but pool their budgets at the end of each period in a single household

11:334:26718:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of non-durable goods, called “cash goods,” “credit goods,” and “special goods.”  In
11:335:26801:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:addition,  we  suppose  that  workers  also  produce  intermediate  “investment  goods”

11:340:27235:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint, the other not) allows the demand for real cash balances to vary with the
11:341:27319:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size of the liquidity premium (opportunity cost of holding cash), for a given level of
11:342:27405:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:planned real expenditure.  This margin of substitution also results in a distortion in
11:343:27491:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  allocation  of  resources  that  depends  on  the  size  of  the  liquidity  premium,  and
11:344:27586:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we wish to take this distortion into account when considering the welfare effects of
11:345:27670:18:17:93:365:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changing the size of the central bank’s balance sheet.
11:346:27724:17:17:111:525:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The introduction of “special goods” purchased only by the investor provides an
11:347:27802:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:alternative use for the funds available to the investor,  so that the amount that in-
11:348:27887:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vestors will spend on risky durables in a fire sale depends on how low the price of
11:349:27970:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the durables falls.6The produced “durable goods” in our model play the role of the
11:350:28052:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risky investment projects in the model of Stein (2012):  they require an initial outlay
11:351:28139:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of resources, financed by bankers, in order to allow the production of something that
11:352:28224:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may or may not yield a return later.  The device of referring separately to investment
11:353:28310:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods and to the durable goods produced from them allows us to treat investment
11:354:28389:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods as perfect substitutes for cash or credit goods on the production side, allowing
11:355:28475:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a simple specification of workers’ disutility of supplying more output, without having
11:356:28561:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also to treat durable goods as perfect substitutes for those goods, which would not
11:357:28644:18:21:93:398:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allow the relative price of durables to rise in a credit boom.
11:358:28706:21:14:93:524:200:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:assets at the end of each “period” is not needed to simplify the model dynamics, because the model
11:359:28804:14:15:93:524:186:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:simply ends when the end of the first and only “period” is reached (in the sense in which the term
11:360:28902:15:14:93:524:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:“period” is used in this model).  Note that in the present model, the representative household device
11:361:29003:14:9:93:394:157:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:also allows more unambiguous welfare comparisons among equilibria.
11:362:29069:9:18:107:524:148:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:6The opportunity of spending on purchases of special goods plays the same role in our model as
11:363:29163:18:0:93:461:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the possibility of investment in “late-arriving projects” in the model of Stein (2012).

13:426:32945:17:17:93:524:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It is assumed, as in Lucas and Stokey (1987), that “cash goods” are sold only for cash

13:429:33203:17:17:93:524:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shopper belongs.  (The liquidity premium associated with cash is thus determined in

13:431:33370:18:0:93:524:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instead sold to shoppers on credit; this means (as in Lucas and Stokey) that accounts
14:432:33457:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are settled between buyers and sellers only at the end of the period, at which point
14:433:33541:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the various household members have again pooled their resources, so that charges by
14:434:33624:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shoppers  during  the  period  can  be  paid  out  of  the  income  received  by  workers  for
14:435:33718:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods sold during that same period.  The only constraint on the amount of credit of
14:436:33801:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this kind that a household can draw upon is assumed to be determined by a no-Ponzi
14:437:33883:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:condition (that is,  the requirement that a household’s debts be able to be paid off
14:438:33967:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eventually out of future income,  rather than rolled over indefinitely).  “Investment
14:439:34052:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods” are sold on credit in the same way.  “Special goods” are also assumed to be
14:440:34134:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sold on credit, but in this case, the amount of credit that investors can draw upon is
14:441:34220:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limited by the size of the line of credit arranged for them in subperiod 1. In particular,
14:442:34310:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is assumed that a given credit limit must be negotiated by the household before

14:447:34742:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is important in order to capture the idea that only a limited quantity of funds can
14:448:34825:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be mobilized (by potential buyers with the expertise required to evaluate the assets)

14:450:34952:17:18:111:525:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The nature of the “cash” that can be used to purchase cash goods requires further
14:451:35033:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comment.  Unlike Lucas and Stokey, we do not assume that only monetary liabilities
14:452:35115:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the government constitute “cash” that is acceptable as a means of payment in this
14:453:35199:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:market.   We  instead  identify  “cash”  with  the  class  of  short-term  safe  instruments
14:454:35291:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(STSIs) discussed by Carlsonet al.(2014) in the case of the U.S.,  which includes
14:455:35372:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S. Treasury bills (and not simply monetary liabilities of the Federal Reserve), and
14:456:35457:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:certain types of collateralized short-term debt of private financial institutions.  The
14:457:35544:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assumption that only these assets can be used to purchase cash goods is intended to
14:458:35627:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stand in for the convenience provided by these special instruments, that accounts for
14:459:35712:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their lower equilibrium yields relative to the short-period holding returns on other
14:460:35796:18:18:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets.10The fact that all assets of this type, whether issued by the government (or
14:461:35880:18:18:107:524:203:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:9In the model of Stein (2012), this limit is ensured by assuming that the “patient investors” have
14:462:35978:18:15:93:524:185:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:a budget that is fixed as a parameter of the model.  Here we endogenize this budget, by allowing
14:463:36074:15:14:93:524:170:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:it to be chosen optimally by the household in subperiod 1; but it is important that we still assume
14:464:36173:14:9:93:275:156:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that it cannot be changed in subperiod 2.
14:465:36214:9:18:103:524:147:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10One interpretation of the “cash-in-advance” constraint is that it actually represents a constraint
14:466:36314:18:0:93:524:129:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:on  the  type  of  assets  that  can  be  held  by  money-market  mutual  funds  (MMMFs).   But  such  a
15:467:36420:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:central bank) or by bankers, are assumed equally to satisfy the constraint is intended
15:468:36506:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  capture  the  way  in  which  the  demand  for  privately-issued  STSIs  is  observed  to
15:469:36599:17:17:93:510:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vary with the supply of publicly-issued STSIs, as shown by Carlsonet al.(2014).
15:470:36678:17:18:111:525:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We do not, of course, deny that there arealsospecial uses for base money (currency

15:472:36843:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Stokey sought to model.  In particular, when the supply of reserves by the Fed
15:473:36925:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  sufficiently  restricted,  as  was  chronically  the  case  prior  to  the  financial  crisis  of
15:474:37026:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2008,  the  special  convenience  of  reserve  balances  in  facilitating  payments  between
15:475:37118:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial intermediaries results in a spread between the yield on reserves and that on
15:476:37204:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:STSIs such as Treasury bills; and the control of this spread by varying the supply of
15:477:37289:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reserves was the focus of monetary policy prior to the crisis.  Nonetheless, the spread
15:478:37376:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the yield on reserves and the T-bill rate (or federal funds rate) is not the one
15:479:37464:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of interest to us here.  Under the circumstances in which the Fed has conducted its
15:480:37547:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experiments with “quantitative easing,” the supply of reserves has been consistently
15:481:37631:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well beyond the level needed to drive the T-bill yield down to (or even below) the
15:482:37713:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yield on reserves.  Hence while certain kinds of payments by banks are constrained by
15:483:37798:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their reserve balances, we may assume that this has not been a binding constraint in
15:484:37882:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the period in which we wish to consider the effects of further changes in the central-
15:485:37968:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank  balance  sheet.   And  granting  that  reserves  have  special  uses  that  can  result
15:486:38061:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a liquidity premium specific to them (under circumstances no longer relevant at
15:487:38143:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:present) does not in any way imply that STSIs cannotalsohave special uses for which
15:488:38226:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other assets will not serve, giving rise to another sort of money premium — one that
15:489:38310:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:need not be zero simply because the premium associated with reserve balances has
15:490:38390:17:17:93:177:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been eliminated.
15:491:38406:17:18:111:525:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The acceptability of a financial claim as “cash” that can be used to purchase cash
15:492:38488:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods  is  assumed  to  depend  on  its  having  a  value  at  maturity  that  is  completely
15:493:38581:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:certain, rather than being state-contingent.  This requires not only that it be a claim
15:494:38668:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  a  fixed  nominal  quantity  at  a  future  date,  but  that  it  be  viewed  as  completely
15:495:38764:18:21:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:safe,  for  one  of  two  possible  reasons:  either  it  is  a  liability  of  the  government  (or

15:497:38959:15:14:93:524:185:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:to investors of holding wealth in MMMFs;  the ability to move funds quickly from them to make
15:498:39052:14:14:93:524:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:purchases  is  one  such  advantage.   Rather  than  explicitly  introducing  a  demand  for  cash  on  the
15:499:39159:14:15:93:524:157:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:part of MMMFs and assuming that households use their MMMF balances to make certain types
15:500:39247:15:14:93:524:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of purchases, we obtain the same equilibrium money premium more simply by supposing that the
15:501:39339:14:0:93:416:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:STSIs can directly be used as a means of payment in certain transactions.

16:503:39499:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be certain of realizing a definite nominal value from it.  We suppose that bankers can
16:504:39585:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issue liabilities that will be accepted as cash, but that these liabilities will have to be
16:505:39676:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:backed by specific risky durables as collateral, and that the holder of the debt has the
16:506:39764:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:right to demand payment of the debt at any time, if they cease to remain confident
16:507:39846:17:17:93:434:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the collateral will continue to guarantee the fixed value for it.
16:508:39916:17:18:111:525:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:When  bankers  purchase  risky  durables  in  the  first  subperiod,  they  can  finance
16:509:40004:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some  portion  of  the  purchase  price  by  issuing  safe  debt  (that  can  be  used  by  the
16:510:40099:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holder during the second sub-period to purchase cash goods),  collateralized by the
16:511:40182:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:durables that are acquired. If in the second subperiod, the “no-crisis” state is reached,
16:512:40271:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  durables  can  continue  to  serve  as  collateral  for  safe  debt,  as  the  value  of  the
16:513:40369:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset in the third subperiod can in this case be anticipated with certainty.  In this
16:514:40454:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, bankers are able to roll over their short-term collateralized debt, and continue
16:515:40540:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  hold  the  durables.   If  instead  the  “crisis”  state  is  reached,  the  durables  can  no
16:516:40638:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:longer collateralize safe debt, as there is now a positive probability that in the third
16:517:40726:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subperiod the durables will be worthless.  In this case, holders of the safe debt demand
16:518:40814:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:repayment in the second sub-period, and the bankers must sell durables in a fire sale,
16:519:40900:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the amount required to pay off the short-term debt.  It is the right to force this
16:520:40985:17:18:93:491:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:liquidation that makes the debt issued by bankers in the first sub-period safe.
16:521:41064:18:17:111:525:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To be more specific, we suppose that the sale of goods (and in particular, cash
16:522:41143:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods) occurs at the beginning of the second subperiod:  after it has been revealed
16:523:41226:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether the crisis state will occur, but before the decision whether to demand imme-
16:524:41310:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diate repayment of the short-term debt is made.  Thus at the time that shoppers seek
16:525:41394:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to purchase cash goods,  they may hold liabilities issued by bankers that grant the
16:526:41477:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holder the right to demand repayment at any time; it is the fact that the short-term
16:527:41561:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debt  has  this  feature  that  allows  it  to  be  accepted  as  cash  in  the  market  for  cash
16:528:41659:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods.  After the market for cash goods has taken place, the holders of the bankers’
16:529:41743:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:short-term debt (who may now include the sellers of cash goods) decide whether to
16:530:41824:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand  immediate  repayment  of  the  debt.   At  this  point,  these  holders  (whether
16:531:41913:17:19:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shoppers  or  workers)  only  care  about  the  contribution  that  the  asset  will  make  to
16:532:42007:19:17:103:524:185:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:11Of  course,  a  claim on  a government  need not  be  completely  safe.  If,  however,  a  government
16:533:42110:17:15:93:524:168:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:borrows  in  its  own  fiat  currency,  and  if  it  is  committed  to  ensure  that  its  nominal  liabilities  are
16:534:42226:15:14:93:524:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:paid with certainty (by monetizing them if necessary), then it is possible for it to issue debt that is
16:535:42329:14:0:93:334:139:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:correctly viewed as completely safe (in nominal terms).
17:536:42386:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  household’s  pooled  end-of-period  budget.   In  the  crisis  state,  they  will  choose
17:537:42480:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to demand repayment,  since this ensures them the face value of the debt,  whereas
17:538:42562:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if they do not demand repayment, they will receive the face value of the debt with

17:540:42731:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand repayment, they receive a claim on the investors who purchase the collateral
17:541:42814:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the fire sale; such a claim is assumed to guarantee payment in the end-of-period
17:542:42897:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:settlement, if within the bound of the line of credit arranged for the investor in the
17:543:42983:18:17:93:171:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first subperiod.
17:544:42999:17:17:111:525:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  other  source  of  assets  that  count  as  cash  is  the  government.   Some  very

17:546:43175:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suppose that the central bank can issue liabilities that also count as cash. If the central
17:547:43266:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank increases its supply of SFSIs by purchasing Treasury bills (that are themselves
17:548:43350:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:SFSIs), the overall supply of cash will be unchanged.  (This is again a demonstration
17:549:43435:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that our concept of “cash” differs importantly from that of Lucas and Stokey.)  But if

18:601:47591:14:15:93:524:157:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:a household can issue other than by having its banker issue it (because it must be collateralized by

24:768:59329:26:17:93:524:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A transfer from the central bank to the Treasury allows the Treasury to make a larger

24:770:59501:18:17:93:524:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the government.  However, this does not change formula (1.17) for the size of net

24:773:59754:18:17:93:177:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instead we write

24:782:60284:18:17:93:524:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:banks), this policy decision directly determines the equilibrium yield on those other
24:783:60369:17:17:93:524:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forms of cash as well.20There are thus two independent dimensions of central-bank

24:785:60546:18:14:93:524:214:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:other STSIs cannot fulfill, and are in sufficiently scarce supply, there will be a spread between the
24:786:60647:14:15:93:524:200:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:interest rate paid on reserves and the equilibrium yield on other STSIs,  though the central bank
24:787:60744:15:14:93:524:185:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:will still have relatively direct control over the equilibrium yield on STSIs,  by varying either the
24:788:60845:14:14:93:524:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:interest rate paid on reserves or the degree of scarcity of reserves.  Even before the increased size

25:796:61516:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the central bank’s target for the interest rate paid on cash, and variation in the size

25:798:61672:17:18:111:525:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There is a further potential dimension of central-bank policy, which is choice of
25:799:61753:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the composition of its balance sheet.  Above we have assumed that the central bank
25:800:61835:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holds only longer-term Treasury securities, but it might also hold Treasury bills on

25:804:62184:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no effect on any other aspect of equilibrium.  To simplify the algebra, we do not even
25:805:62270:18:44:93:391:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allow for this possibility in the notation introduced above.

27:877:66643:18:17:93:524:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Under this assumption, there is no difference between the information set in the first

27:882:67085:14:0:93:524:133:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(in the case that the crisis state is reached).  However, because of the assumption of full depreciation

28:893:67990:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:slackness conditions.  We can see from condition (2.13), together with the assumption

28:896:68239:18:17:93:525:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it is associated with an inequality constraint (condition (1.4)), the multiplierφ4tis
28:897:68324:17:17:93:525:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:necessarily non-negative; condition (2.2) then implies thatφ1t>0 necessarily.  The
28:898:68406:17:18:93:525:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:remaining multipliers,φ2t,φ3t,φ4t, are associated with inequality constraints and so
28:899:68490:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are necessarily non-negative, but may be equal to zero if the constraints in question do

28:901:68666:17:22:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has a positive value, the corresponding inequality constraint must hold with equality.

28:905:69063:15:14:93:524:330:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:random disturbances (such as an unexpected change in the size of net transfersTt) are allowed to
28:906:69159:14:15:93:524:316:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:occur in subperiod 3.  We assume that policy in periodst+ 1 and later is also independent of whether
28:907:69259:15:14:93:525:301:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:an asset collapse has occurred in periodt.  Given this, the relevant information set for equilibrium

29:924:70629:17:17:93:524:647:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must hold.  We now draw some further conclusions about relations that must exist
29:925:70709:17:18:93:524:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among  the  various  endogenous  variables  in  an  equilibrium,  in  order  to  understand

29:927:70845:17:17:111:525:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To simplify the discussion, in the present paper we shall restrict attention to the
29:928:70928:17:18:93:524:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case in which any exogenous factors that change over time (apart from the occurrence
29:929:71012:18:17:93:524:560:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of crisis states and asset collapses, as depicted in Figure 1) are purely deterministic
29:930:71099:17:17:93:525:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(that  is,  simply  a  function  of  the  datet).   That  is,  when  we  consider  the  effects
29:931:71194:17:18:93:524:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a temporary disturbance of any other type,  we shall consider only the case of a
29:932:71277:18:17:93:524:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock that occurs in the initial periodt= 0,with consequences that are perfectly
29:933:71357:17:17:93:524:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predictable  after  that.  We shall  also  restrict attention  to the  effects  of alternative

29:935:71536:18:17:93:524:456:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we can consider the effects of responding in different ways to a one-time disturbance
29:936:71621:17:17:93:524:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(in section xx below), we do not consider the effects of responding to the occurrence

29:938:71809:18:17:93:524:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reason  is  that  our  concern  here  is  with  the  consequences  for  the  risks  to  financial

29:942:72155:17:17:111:525:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Under this assumption, neither the occurrence of a crisis nor an asset collapse in

29:944:72318:18:17:93:525:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an equilibrium in which the variables listed above as functions of the historyξtdepend

29:947:72572:18:17:93:524:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:during the period has no effect on equilibrium in later periods, the Lagrange multiplier

29:952:73007:17:18:93:524:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether a crisis occurs.  Similarly,  the Lagrange multiplierφ4tassociated with the
29:953:73090:18:0:93:524:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cash-in-advance constraint will have a value that is independent of whether a crisis

31:1009:76542:17:18:111:524:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Sinceφ5t>0 in each state, budget constraint (1.5) must hold with equality in each

31:1011:76706:17:29:93:524:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:side of (1.5) must be the same whether a crisis occurs or not, so that in equilibrium,

31:1015:76931:29:18:93:525:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We can solve this equation for   ̃φn5t=   ̃φn5( ̃φc5t),a monotonically decreasing function

32:1022:77264:17:25:111:311:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we note that (2.7) implies that

36:1180:87027:15:9:93:309:169:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:as a means of payment in the cash goods market.
36:1181:87074:9:18:103:525:160:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:31Equation (2.3) states that an asset that yieldsYtat the end of period in marginal-utility units

37:1184:87336:0:18:93:336:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the total supply of cash will be given by (2.28).
37:1185:87385:18:17:111:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It remains to determine the equilibrium value ofs∗t.We first note that in marginal-

37:1187:87504:26:32:237:525:646:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:ˆMt≡φ6tMt=λt ̃mt+ ̃Γts∗t,(2.29)
37:1188:87535:32:17:93:525:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using the notation   ̃mt≡ ̃Mt/Ptfor the real supply of safe assets by the government.
37:1189:87620:17:30:93:251:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Then in any equilibrium where

37:1191:87674:29:17:93:524:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:the  cash-in-advance  constraint  will  not  bind;  but  since  this  implies  that   ̃φ2t=  0,
37:1192:87769:17:17:93:484:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2.24) implies that  ̃φc5tcannot be greater than 1, which requires thats∗t= 0.
37:1193:87847:17:29:111:353:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Hence such an equilibrium occurs if and only if

37:1195:87922:29:18:93:524:446:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:and  involvesˆMt=λt ̃mt.In  this  case,  (2.25)  implies  that   ̃φ3t=  0,so  that ̃Qt
37:1196:88008:18:17:93:524:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  equal  to  the  fundamental  value  (2.27).   In  addition,  becauses∗t=  0,we  must
37:1197:88096:17:17:93:524:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have ̃Γt= ̃Γ(0) = 1,so that durables are also priced at their fundamental value in
37:1198:88178:17:18:93:329:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subperiod 2, even if the crisis state is reached.
37:1199:88227:18:17:111:525:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Let us consider now the possibility of an equilibrium in which the supply of real

37:1201:88395:17:18:93:524:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the supply of durablesstis large enough so that bankers are unconstrained in the

37:1203:88564:17:29:93:275:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this requires a value ofs∗tsuch that

37:1205:88654:29:18:93:524:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It  follows  from  our  discussion  above  that  the  left-hand  side  of  this  equation  is  an
37:1206:88751:18:17:93:523:231:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:increasing function ofs∗t,while the right-hand side is a non-increasing function ofs∗t

37:1210:89086:19:18:103:525:160:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:32Recall that ̃Γ(s∗)s∗= ̃D( ̃φc5(s∗)) is a monotonically increasing function ofs∗, and that  ̃φ2(λ;m)

38:1214:89404:18:26:93:482:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:greater than the right-hand side whens∗t=st,which is to say, if and only if
38:1215:89479:26:26:210:525:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A: ̃φc5(st)−1> ̃φ2(λt;   ̃mt+ ̃Γ(st)st/λt).(2.32)
38:1216:89526:26:18:111:525:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus such an equilibrium exists in periodtif and only if the outside supply of safe

38:1218:89698:17:17:93:525:602:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such a case,s∗tis implicitly defined by (2.31), and the total supply of cash is given by
38:1219:89786:17:18:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:(2.29).  In this case, again   ̃φ3t= 0,and hence ̃Qt= ̃Qfundt.Moreover, if   ̃mt< c∗1(λt),
38:1220:89876:18:17:93:525:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the solution must involves∗t>0 and hence ̃Γt<1,so that durables are under-priced
38:1221:89956:17:17:93:286:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the fire sale in the event of a crisis.
38:1222:89998:17:18:111:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:If, instead,   ̃mtdoes not satisfy (2.30) and the supply of durablesstfails to satisfy
38:1223:90084:18:17:93:524:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2.32), then there can only be an equilibrium in whichs∗t=st.In this case, the supply
38:1224:90169:17:14:93:218:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of safe assets is given by
38:1225:90195:14:26:256:525:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:ˆMt=λt ̃mt+ ̃Γ(st)st.(2.33)
38:1226:90222:26:17:93:524:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The value of   ̃φ3tis given by (2.25),  which will be positive in the case of any value
38:1227:90309:17:15:93:524:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofstsuch that the inequality in (2.32) is reversed.  In any such case, we must have

38:1229:90481:20:17:93:524:406:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:s∗t>0 implies that ̃Γt<1,so that durables areunder-pricedin the event of a fire
38:1230:90560:17:18:93:525:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sale, even though they areover-pricedin subperiod 1.  In this case, an asset “boom”
38:1231:90643:18:17:93:243:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can be followed by a “crash.”
38:1232:90672:17:17:111:525:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus  we  are  able  to  completely  characterize  the  equilibrium  pricing  of  risky

38:1236:91027:17:18:93:525:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(which follows directly from the quantityIt−1of investment goods produced in the

38:1238:91192:17:17:93:524:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to additional real end-of-period wealth.  The latter quantity depends on expectations
38:1239:91277:17:18:93:327:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about subsequent periods, as we discuss next.
38:1240:91322:18:17:111:525:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In particular, we can write the subperiod 1 equilibrium price of durables, expressed
38:1241:91406:17:26:93:289:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in marginal-utility units, as a function

38:1243:91469:27:17:93:524:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:derived in the manner just explained.  It is useful for the discussion below to consider
38:1244:91557:17:0:93:525:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:how this function depends on the supply of durablesst.  In the case of an outside cash

39:1246:91735:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we must have   ̃φ3t= 0,so that (2.26) implies thatφ(λt;st, ̃mt) = ̃Q∗.Thus the value
39:1247:91819:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the function is independent of the value ofstin either of these cases.  If instead we
39:1248:91907:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have both an outside cash supply below the satiation level and a supply of durables
39:1249:91990:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:too small to satisfy (2.32), the equilibrium supply of safe assets is given by (2.33).
39:1250:92076:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The right-hand side of this equation is a monotonically increasing function ofst,so

39:1252:92211:18:17:111:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It  follows  from  this  that  the  equilibrium  value  of   ̃φ3tgiven  by  (2.25)  will  be  a
39:1253:92306:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monotonically decreasing function ofst.  It then follows from (2.26) that  ̃φ1t ̃Qtwill be
39:1254:92396:17:18:93:525:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a monotonically decreasing function ofst, and hence that the functionφ(λt;st, ̃mt)
39:1255:92478:18:17:93:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  decreasing  in  this  argument.   Thus  in  the  case  that   ̃mt< c∗1(λt),the  function
39:1256:92570:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:φ(λt;st, ̃mt) will be a decreasing function ofstfor all supplies of durables too small
39:1257:92656:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:to satisfy (2.32), and will instead be constant at its minimum value of ̃Q∗for allst
39:1258:92740:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:large enough to satisfy (2.32).  The function is constant (and equal to ̃Q∗) whenever

39:1260:92868:17:18:111:525:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It will also be useful for our discussion below of intertemporal equilibrium to note
39:1261:92952:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the relative value of funds available in subperiod 1 as opposed to the end of the

39:1264:93114:30:17:93:524:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This function depends only on the value ofλt,in the case that   ̃mt≥c∗1(λt),so that

39:1268:93454:17:17:93:525:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, in the case that   ̃mt< c∗1(λt) andstis too small to satisfy (2.32), the value
39:1269:93541:17:18:93:524:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the function depends on all three of its arguments.  (In this latter case,Mt/Ptwill

40:1276:94072:0:27:93:500:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of durables just derived, condition (2.12) can be written in the alternative form
40:1277:94153:27:27:221:525:680:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:λt=β φ(λt+1;F(It), ̃mt+1)F′(It).(2.35)
40:1278:94191:27:17:93:524:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Here we have also used the fact that the supply of durables in periodt+ 1 must

40:1280:94287:17:18:111:525:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Since the right-hand side of this expression must be a monotonically decreasing

40:1282:94452:17:26:93:253:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which we can write in the form

40:1284:94509:27:17:93:525:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Because  the  right-hand  side  of  (2.35)  is  a  decreasing  function  ofIt,the  function
40:1285:94600:17:18:93:525:514:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:I(λ;λ′, ̃m)  implicitly  defined  by  this  equation  will  be  a  monotonically  decreasing
40:1286:94692:18:17:93:524:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:function ofλ.  Thus we obtain a “demand curve” for investment that is a decreasing
40:1287:94774:17:17:93:524:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:function ofλt, similar to the demands for cash and credit goods as decreasing functions
40:1288:94861:17:18:93:525:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofλtthat can be derived in the way explained above.  But whereas the demands for
40:1289:94941:18:17:93:524:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cash and credit goods depend onstand   ̃mtalong with the value ofλt,investment
40:1290:95019:17:17:93:525:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand depends on expectations regarding the values ofλt+1and   ̃mt+1along with
40:1291:95098:17:18:93:170:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the value ofλt.
40:1292:95113:18:26:111:524:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:If we write our solution for the sum of the demands for cash and credit goods as

40:1294:95215:27:27:93:416:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:then the aggregate demand for normal goods can be written as
40:1295:95275:27:26:211:525:312:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:Yt=y(λt;st, ̃mt) +I(λt;λt+1, ̃mt+1).(2.37)
40:1296:95317:26:18:93:524:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In a flexible-price equilibrium (the kind assumed thus far), this quantity of normal

40:1300:95598:26:17:93:525:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Since the left-hand side of this equation is a non-increasing function ofλt(strictly

40:1302:95762:18:17:93:264:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:values ofIt−1, ̃mt, ̃mt+1,andλt+1.
40:1303:95796:17:18:103:524:146:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:33Here we rely upon the demonstration above thatφ(λ;s, ̃m) is a non-increasing, positive-valued

42:1359:99691:18:17:93:524:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other complications not present in the simple model used in that discussion, what
42:1360:99776:17:17:93:525:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matters is that the variablermt+1in equation (2.40) evolves in a way that is completely
42:1361:99863:17:18:93:524:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exogenous  with  respect  to  the  evolution  of  the  price  level  and  independent  of  the
42:1362:99957:18:17:93:335:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specification of (conventional) monetary policy.
42:1363:100005:17:17:111:525:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It will simplify the discussion that follows if we let conventional monetary policy
42:1364:100088:17:18:93:524:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be specified not by a central-bank reaction function, but rather by a target path for

42:1368:100425:18:17:93:524:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assume that the path of the price level conforms to the target path chosen by the
42:1369:100506:17:17:93:524:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:central bank, and use equation (2.40) to determine the implied equilibrium evolution

42:1371:100627:16:18:103:524:203:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:35The  model  as  described  above  would  in  fact  not  preclude  a  negative  nominal  interest  rate

42:1373:100837:14:14:93:524:171:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:households can demand currency from the central bank at any time in exchange for interest-earning
42:1374:100934:14:15:93:524:157:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:cash, which would for institutional reasons earn a zero nominal interest rate, and that such currency
42:1375:101035:15:14:93:524:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:would  be  acceptable  as  payment  for  cash  goods.   The  possibility  of  holding  currency  would  then
42:1376:101143:14:0:93:303:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:preclude equilibria withRmt+1<1 in any period.

45:1441:105532:0:29:93:326:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is possible to choose any value of Π such that

45:1447:105915:17:17:93:524:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which we can determine as follows.  In a stationary equilibrium with satiation in cash

45:1459:106483:17:17:93:525:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the left-hand side of (3.2) is a non-increasing function ofλ,and the equation

45:1471:107347:18:17:111:525:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We thus find that there is a two-dimensional family of possible stationary equilib-

46:1473:107517:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can be independently varied using the two dimensions of central-bank policy: conven-

46:1483:108324:18:17:111:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The possible stationary values of the various real variables that can be achieved
46:1484:108405:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by alternative monetary policies can thus be fully characterized by considering the
46:1485:108488:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:one-parameter family of stationary equilibria corresponding to different values of   ̃m.
46:1486:108576:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These equilibria can be classified as of three possible types, according to which of the
46:1487:108664:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial constraints bind.  (The three possible cases correspond to the three cases
46:1488:108748:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discussed in our treatment in the previous section of the endogenous determination
46:1489:108830:18:17:93:219:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the safe asset supply.)
46:1490:108856:17:17:111:525:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:First, there are equilibria in which the real outside supply of safe assets equals or
46:1491:108941:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exceeds the levelm∗required for satiation;  in these equilibria,  the cash-in-advance
46:1492:109026:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraint  is  slack,  bankers  finance  none  of  their  purchases  of  durables  by  issuing
46:1493:109121:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:collateralized short-term debt (so that the collateral constraint on such issuance is
46:1494:109206:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also slack), and as no assets are sold in a fire sale even if the crisis state occurs, there
46:1495:109298:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is no ex post regret of the size of investors’ credit limit (so that the constraint that
46:1496:109386:17:17:93:349:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this must be fixed in advance also does not bind).
46:1497:109436:17:18:111:525:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second,  there  are  equilibria  in  which  the  real  outside  supply  of  safe  assets  is
46:1498:109528:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insufficient, and there is some private issuance of safe debt, but the quantity of safe
46:1499:109615:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debt issued by bankers is still small enough for the collateral constraint not to bind.
46:1500:109702:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:And  third,  there  are  equilibria  in  which  the  incentive  for  issuance  of  safe  debt  by
46:1501:109799:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bankers is so strong that their issuance of such liabilities is limited by the availability
46:1502:109890:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of suitable collateral.  The three cases correspond to different ranges of real outside
46:1503:109977:17:18:93:525:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:supply of safe assets:  high values of   ̃m, an intermediate range of values of   ̃m,and low
46:1504:110069:18:17:93:217:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:values of   ̃mrespectively.

47:1533:110866:18:17:93:524:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:how systematic variation in this parameter changes the character of the stationary
47:1534:110948:17:17:93:154:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium.
47:1535:110960:17:18:111:524:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 2 shows how the stationary equilibrium values ofc1,c2,cc3,cn3,andIvary
47:1536:111037:18:17:93:524:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with  alternative  stationary  values  forRm/Π.(The  figure  thus  completely  displays
47:1537:111124:17:17:93:524:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the allocation of real resources in each possible equilibrium, and supplies all of the
47:1538:111210:17:18:93:524:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information  needed  to  evaluate  the  level  of  expected  utility  of  the  representative

47:1540:111388:17:0:93:525:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:possible long-run policy targets.)  The values ofRm/Π considered vary from 1 +rm(0)
48:1541:111473:0:18:93:513:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at the left boundary of the figure to 1 +rm(m∗) =β−1>1 at the right boundary.
48:1542:111550:18:17:111:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this example, cash and credit goods enter the household’s utility function sym-
48:1543:111632:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:metrically,  so  that  in  an  efficient  allocation  equal  quantities  of  the  two  goods  are
48:1544:111729:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:produced and consumed;  thus a comparison of the magnitudes ofc1andc2can be
48:1545:111804:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:used to see the size of the distortion created by the cash-in-advance constraint.  There
48:1546:111892:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:is no distortion (c1=c2) at the extreme right of the figure, i.e., whenRm/Π =β−1,
48:1547:111973:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:so that there is no spread between the return on longer-term bonds and cash.  Moving
48:1548:112057:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:left in the figure, as the real return on cash is reduced (meaning that the spread is
48:1549:112142:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:made progressively larger), the extent to whichc1is less thanc2grows progressively
48:1550:112224:17:18:93:132:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:greater.
48:1551:112232:18:17:111:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  efficiency  of  the  level  of  production  and  consumption  of  special  goods  can
48:1552:112322:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also be seen directly from the figure.  Because both the utility from consuming spe-
48:1553:112406:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cial goods and the disutility of supplying them are independent of which state occurs
48:1554:112491:18:17:93:525:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in subperiod 2, an efficient allocation requires thatcn3equalcc3; and for the parameter-
48:1555:112579:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ization used in this example, the common efficient level of special goods production
48:1556:112663:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is equal to 1 (regardless of the level of production and consumption of other goods).
48:1557:112748:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus the degree to whichcn3is greater thancc3(and to which the former quantity is
48:1558:112829:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:greater than 1, while the latter quantity is smaller) indicates the degree to which the
48:1559:112916:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:production and consumption of special goods is distorted by the fact that investors
48:1560:112999:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:spend some of their resources on acquiring risky durables in the fire sale that occurs
48:1561:113085:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  the  crisis  state.   As  one  moves  from  right  to  left  in  the  figure,  the  incentive  of
48:1562:113186:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bankers to issue collateralized short-term debt increases, but the consequence is an
48:1563:113270:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increasing quantity of durables that must be sold to redeem such debt in the even of
48:1564:113354:17:17:93:354:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:a fire sale, increasing the wedge betweencn3andcc3.
48:1565:113405:17:18:111:525:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The three different possible types of equilibrium correspond to different regions of

48:1568:113662:17:18:93:525:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this corresponds to an entire range of possible values of   ̃m(any   ̃m≥m∗), they all
48:1569:113747:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correspond to the same real return on cash and the same allocation of resources.  The
48:1570:113832:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case in which the cash-in-advance constraint binds but bankers’ collateral constraint
48:1571:113917:17:18:93:525:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is slack corresponds to values ofRm/Π from around 0.91 to 1.01, while the case in
48:1572:113998:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which both constraints bind corresponds to all values ofRm/Π from the left boundary

49:1597:114905:17:18:93:524:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issuance as rapidly (because now the quantity of debt issued can increase only to the
49:1598:114990:18:17:93:524:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:extent that the quantity of durables purchased by bankers also increases enough to
49:1599:115072:17:17:93:524:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide the required additional collateral), so that the wedge betweencn3andcc3no

49:1602:115339:17:17:93:524:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value, the equilibrium production of durables now increases more rapidly with further
49:1603:115424:17:0:93:198:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:reductions inRm/Π.

50:1609:115861:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of comparison, the market value ̃Qsof those same assets in subperiod 1.37One sees
50:1610:115942:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that as the equilibrium return on cash falls, and the money premium correspondingly
50:1611:116025:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases,  as one moves from the right boundary of the figure to the left,  that the
50:1612:116110:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issuance of short-term debt by banks increases from an initial value of zero (when
50:1613:116192:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the money premium is zero) to progressively higher values.  The rate of increase is
50:1614:116275:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sharpest in the high-cash-return region, because the upper bound on debt issuance
50:1615:116356:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not bind; after that constraint begins to bind (aroundRm/Π = 0.91), ̃Dincreases
50:1616:116440:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less  sharply  with  further  declines  inRm/Π,as  it  can  only  increase  to  the  extent
50:1617:116531:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that ̃Γsalso increases.  In fact,  in the high-cash-return region, ̃Γsdecreases as the
50:1618:116617:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:money premium increases; the reason is that, as short-term debt issuance increases
50:1619:116699:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the quantity of assets that must be sold in a fire sale in the event of a crisis increases,
50:1620:116790:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:depressing  the  fire-sale  value  of  bankers’  assets.   OnceRm/Π  falls  to  around  0.91,
50:1621:116883:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the constraint comes to bind, both because of the increase in desired debt issuance
50:1622:116966:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:andthe reduction in the value of the collateral available to back such debt.  Beyond
50:1623:117050:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this point, further increases in the size of the money premium cause ̃Γsto increase,
50:1624:117134:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rather than continuing to decrease; this is because the value of relaxing the constraint
50:1625:117222:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on short-term debt issuance now contributes to a larger market value of durables in
50:1626:117305:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subperiod 1,38which induces a larger market supply of durables (as can be seen from
50:1627:117388:17:14:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:theIcurve in Figure 2), so that ̃Γsincreases slightly, even though the fire-sale price
50:1628:117474:14:19:94:189:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: ̃Γ continues to fall.
50:1629:117496:19:18:103:524:275:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:37Each of these variables is measured in marginal-utility units, as they have a constant value in
50:1630:117593:18:14:93:524:257:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:marginal-utility units in a stationary equilibrium, regardless of the rate of inflation.  Also, we have
50:1631:117696:14:15:93:524:243:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:shown above that the equilibrium relations determining the values of these variables are in many
50:1632:117792:15:9:93:475:228:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:cases simpler when written in terms of the variables expressed in marginal-utility units.
50:1633:117881:9:18:103:524:219:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:38Specifically, the value of  ̃φ1 ̃Q/λincreases, which is the ratio of the marginal-utility value of the
50:1634:117985:18:15:93:524:201:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:sale price of a unit of the durable good in subperiod 1, given that payment received in subperiod 1
50:1635:118084:15:14:93:524:186:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:can be used to acquire cash for use by the shopper, to the marginal-utility value of the sale price
50:1636:118183:14:14:93:524:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of a unit of normal goods in subperiod 2.  This relative price determines the incentive to produce
50:1637:118281:14:15:93:524:158:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:additional investment goods, as shown by condition (2.12), and hence the supply of durables.  Note
50:1638:118379:15:0:93:515:143:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that the stationary value of ̃Qdoesnotincrease, as can be seen from the ̃Qscurve in this figure.
51:1639:118477:0:18:111:525:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We can also see, from the size of the gap between the solid line indicating the value
51:1640:118562:18:17:93:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ofˆMand the dashed line indicating the value of ̃D, how the part of the cash supply
51:1641:118645:17:17:93:525:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that comes from outside safe assets (the value ofλ ̃m, in marginal-utility units) varies
51:1642:118733:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across the alternative stationary equilibria. This value decreases monotonically as one
51:1643:118820:18:17:93:523:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:proceeds from right to left in the figure, both because ̃Dincreases and becauseˆM
51:1644:118901:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decreases; the latter effect represents the reduction in the demand for cash balances
51:1645:118986:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as the opportunity cost of holding them (i.e.,  the money premium) increases.  The
51:1646:119068:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fact that the equilibrium relationship between the size of the money premium and the
51:1647:119152:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quantity of outside safe assets is monotonic indicates how the choice of a stationary
51:1648:119237:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level for the supply of outside safe assets (through the combination of the Treasury’s
51:1649:119323:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debt-management policy and the central bank’s balance-sheet policy) can be used to
51:1650:119405:17:17:93:525:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determine the stationary value ofRm/Π, and thus to select which of the stationary
51:1651:119486:17:18:93:340:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria depicted in these figures should occur.
51:1652:119536:18:17:111:525:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Note that there is a limit to how farRm/Π can be reduced by shrinking the supply
51:1653:119616:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of outside safe assets; at the left edge of the figure,   ̃mfalls to zero, whileRm/Π is still
51:1654:119709:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positive.  (This is because this lower bound does not correspond to an opportunity
51:1655:119791:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost high enough to reduce the demand for cash balances to zero; it is only necessary
51:1656:119876:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the demand for cash balances fall to a low enough level that it is no greater than
51:1657:119963:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the quantity of safe  liabilities that bankers wish  to supply,  which grows the larger
51:1658:120050:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the money premium gets.)  However, this lower bound forRm/Π can easily be well
51:1659:120128:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:below 1 (as shown in the figure), corresponding to a negative long-run equilibrium
51:1660:120210:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:short-term real rate.  Thus our model is one in which it is perfectly possible to have
51:1661:120296:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an  equilibrium  short-term  real  rate  that  remains  negative  forever,  as  a  result  of  a
51:1662:120392:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shortage of safe assets; this results in a “safety trap” in the sense of Caballero and
51:1663:120478:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Farhi  (2013),  in  the  case  that  the  inflation  target  Π  is  too  low.   An  advantage  of
51:1664:120575:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:working with a fully developed monetary equilibrium model, however, is that we see
51:1665:120657:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the existence of a safety trap depends not simply on too low a supply of safe
51:1666:120739:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets (or too great a demand for them), butalsoon choosing too low an inflation
51:1667:120819:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:target, just as in the “liquidity trap” model of Krugman (1998) and Eggertsson and
51:1668:120901:17:17:93:183:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Woodford (2003).
51:1669:120917:17:18:111:525:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 shows how the degree to which durables are both over-valued in subperiod

52:1692:121775:17:18:93:524:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exceeds 1.  We see that it equals 1 (there is no over-valuation) in the high-cash-return

56:1807:129937:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results  in  a  more  efficient  allocation  of  household  expenditure  on  cash  and  credit

56:1812:130374:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points in the same direction:  the equilibrium allocation of resources is more efficient
56:1813:130462:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(and  the  welfare  of  the  representative  household  is  increased)  if  the  real  supply  of
56:1814:130559:17:17:93:252:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outside safe assets is increased.

56:1817:130764:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seem surprising in light of the analysis of Lucas and Stokey (1987),  who conclude,

56:1823:131308:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from their assumption that the safe liabilities that count as cash must earn a nominal

56:1825:131476:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different values ofRm/Π must correspond to different rates of inflation Π — whereas
56:1826:131559:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:here the choice of the inflation target Π is independent of the aspects of policy that
56:1827:131645:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determineRm/Π, within the bound required by the lower bound on nominal interest
56:1828:131724:18:17:93:121:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates.
56:1829:131730:17:17:111:525:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Lucas and Stokey conclude, as we do, that relaxation of the cash-in-advance con-
56:1830:131810:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:straint, and a more efficient allocation of expenditure between cash and credit goods,
56:1831:131896:18:17:93:525:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:requires a higher value ofRm/Π,but in their analysis this requires a lower rate of
56:1832:131978:17:14:93:524:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inflation, and hence a lower rate of growth of thenominalvalue of outside safe assets

57:1836:132329:17:14:93:525:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(by appropriate variation inRmt), so that there is a decision to make about how large
57:1837:132414:14:21:97:525:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: ̃Mtshould be relative to the level ofPtaimed at through interest-rate policy, that is

57:1839:132585:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is not correct, more generally, to identify a decision to increase the size of the cen-

57:1841:132756:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:long run, these are two distinct issues.  The short-run consequences of balance-sheet

57:1848:133210:18:17:93:524:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:requirement that they hold reserves in proportion to their issuance of such liabilities.
57:1849:133298:17:17:93:524:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Such reserve requirements apply (at least in some countries, like the US) to at least

57:1857:133986:18:17:93:524:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability that would cut in the opposite direction to the analysis above; that
57:1858:134074:17:17:93:524:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is, it might seem that expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet should have as
57:1859:134157:17:18:93:524:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an  effect,  or  even  as  its  primary  effect,  an  increase  in  the  extent  to  which  private
57:1860:134256:18:18:93:524:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:banks acquire risky assets and finance those assets by issuing money-like liabilities.

57:1863:134540:14:14:93:524:158:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:principle be withdrawn on short notice, they were not, probably owing to the existence of deposit
57:1864:134637:14:0:93:428:144:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:insurance; and so they were not responsible for any appreciable funding risk.
58:1865:134716:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This  is  in  fact  a  key  theme  of  the  analysis  by  Stein  (2012),  and  the  basis  for  the

58:1870:135112:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period  when  the  Fed’s  experiments  with  quantitative  easing  have  occurred.44We
58:1871:135198:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can,  however,  use our framework to discuss the consequences for financial stability
58:1872:135283:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of increasing or decreasing the cost to financial institutions of issuing collateralized
58:1873:135371:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:short-term  debt  as  a  source  of  financing,  even  when  they  hold  sufficient  assets  to
58:1874:135466:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide the collateral for such issuance.  But we view this as a separate dimension of
58:1875:135552:18:17:93:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policy —macroprudentialpolicy — that should be distinguished, conceptually, from
58:1876:135632:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both conventional monetary policy (interest-rate policy) and central-bank balance-
58:1877:135714:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sheet policy.45One might well use instruments of macroprudential policy that affect
58:1878:135797:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the ability and/or incentives of banks to issue money-like liabilities that are unrelated
58:1879:135886:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the central bank’s balance sheet (and that do not depend on the existence of reserve
58:1880:135973:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:requirements).  And even when the tool that is used is a reserve requirement, one can
58:1881:136058:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loosen or tighten this constraint independently of the way one that changes the size
58:1882:136142:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the central bank’s balance sheet; first, because one can vary the required reserve
58:1883:136227:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio as well as the supply of reserves, and second, because the central bank can vary
58:1884:136313:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the supply of STSIs without varying the supply of reserves, if it issues central-bank

58:1886:136484:17:18:93:246:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bills on its own balance sheet.

58:1888:136597:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects (considered above) of varying the central bank’s supply of outside safe assets,
58:1889:136684:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when the latter policy is implemented in a way that has no direct effects on finan-

58:1893:137053:15:9:93:292:223:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:with repos or asset-backed commercial paper.

58:1896:137298:14:15:93:524:182:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:distinct types of policy instruments exist.  The discussion of optimal policy by Sergeyev does not

64:2062:146685:18:17:111:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We can now ask to what extent the effects of expanding the supply of central-bank

64:2079:148108:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a movement from left to right in Figures 6-8, which essentially reverses the effects seen
64:2080:148197:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the earlier figures:  short-term debt issuance by private banks increases, both the

64:2084:148511:17:17:111:525:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In fact, both an expansion of the outside supply of safe assets and a tightening

64:2088:148864:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sued far enough, will completely eliminate private issuance of money-like claims (the

64:2090:149034:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eliminate the distortions resulting from the risk of a fire sale of assets and from the
64:2091:149121:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desire of bankers to obtain assets that can be used to collateralize short-term debt
64:2092:149205:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issuance.   Thus  each  of  these  policies,  either  of  which  is  welfare-enhancing  (when
64:2093:149298:17:17:93:524:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not irrelevant),  can serve to some extent as a substitute for the other.  It is worth
64:2094:149384:17:0:93:524:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:noting, however, that while a sufficient increase in the outside supply of safe assets
65:2095:149472:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would make macroprudential policy unnecessary in our model (since private issuance
65:2096:149554:18:17:93:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of money-like claims can be completely eliminated, even ifξ= 1), the reverse is not
65:2097:149637:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:true:  even a macroprudential policy of the maximum possible stringency (one that
65:2098:149718:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:completely prevents private issuance of STSIs) will not eliminate the welfare gains
65:2099:149801:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from further expansion of the outside supply of safe assets, since even when ̃D= 0

65:2105:150171:29:18:93:524:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the analysis thus far,  all prices have been assumed to be perfectly flexible,  and

65:2107:150349:17:17:93:524:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no real effects, and affects only the general level of prices in terms of the monetary
65:2108:150435:17:18:93:524:434:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unit.  It follows that conventional monetary policy has no consequences for financial
65:2109:150520:18:17:93:524:416:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stability.   This  establishes  a  sharp  distinction  between  the  effects  of  conventional
65:2110:150614:17:17:93:524:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monetary policy (interest-rate policy) and balance-sheet policy, since as shown above,
65:2111:150700:17:18:93:524:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  central  bank’s  balance  sheet  (specifically,  therealsupply  of  safe  assets  by  the

65:2113:150855:17:17:111:525:347:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Such an analysis is adequate for consideration of the possible long-run stationary

65:2115:151027:18:17:93:524:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not suffice for an analysis of the considerations at play when alternative dimen-

65:2117:151195:17:18:93:524:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:objectives, and this is the context in which central banks’ recent experiments with
65:2118:151278:18:17:93:524:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative easing have been conducted.  To address the issues raised by recent poli-
65:2119:151364:17:17:93:524:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cies, we need to consider the consequences for financial stability of using quantitative
65:2120:151452:17:18:93:524:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing as a substitute for an interest-rate cut that is prevented by the effective lower
65:2121:151540:18:17:93:524:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bound on short-term nominal interest rates, in a situation where such an interest-rate
65:2122:151626:17:17:93:477:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cut would otherwise be desired in order to achieve a higher level of output.
65:2123:151702:17:18:111:525:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  notion  that  an  interest-rate  cut  would  be  desired  in  order  to  increase  real

65:2125:151877:17:0:93:524:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss a simple extension of the model presented above, that shows how sticky
66:2126:151960:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices allow conventional monetary policy to have real effects in the short run, while

66:2128:152131:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects  of quantitative  easing to  those  of an  interest-rate  cut,  both  with  respect  to

66:2144:153395:17:17:111:525:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  fact  that  the  shock  is  completely  unexpected  means  that  before  it  occurs,
66:2145:153484:17:18:93:524:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:people expect an equilibrium in which there will never be any random developments

66:2147:153656:17:17:93:524:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  stationary  equilibrium  of  the  kind  described  in  section  3.   Note  that  in  such  an
66:2148:153752:17:18:93:524:297:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium, the pricePτof normal goods in any periodτis a deterministic function
66:2149:153833:18:17:93:525:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of time; it does not depend on which state is reached in subperiod 2 of periodτ, nor

66:2151:154009:17:18:93:524:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may suppose that the same pricePτis set for normal goods in all periodsτ≤tas
66:2152:154085:18:17:93:524:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would clear markets in the flexible-price stationary equilibrium analyzed above, even
66:2153:154170:17:17:93:525:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if the pricePτmust be set before subperiod 2 of periodτis reached.  For purposes of
66:2154:154253:17:18:93:524:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the present discussion, we need not discuss how exactly the predetermined price of
66:2155:154335:18:17:93:524:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:normal goods is determined, beyond the assumption that in an environment where
66:2156:154413:17:17:93:524:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the future is perfectly predictable (except for the uncertainty each period depicted in

67:2158:154589:0:18:93:165:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:normal goods.
67:2159:154602:18:17:111:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Let us suppose that periodtis one in which no crisis occurs in subperiod 2 (though

67:2161:154773:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that in subperiod 2 of periodt, an unexpected shock occurs, as a result of which the
67:2162:154857:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:utility of cash and credit goods consumption is equal toχu(c1t,c2t), and the disutility
67:2163:154944:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of supplying normal goods is equal toχv(Yt),for some factorχ >0 that need not
67:2164:155021:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equal  1;  the  other  components  of  the  utility  function  are  unaffected  by  the  shock.
67:2165:155116:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The factorχis assumed to take a value different from 1 only in periodt(and prior

67:2167:155282:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  assuming  a  shock  of  this  particular  type  is  that  for  a  given  level  of  production

67:2169:155462:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit goods would not be changed by the shockχ; however, the real rate of interest
67:2170:155545:17:18:93:525:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:required  to  sustain  that  level  of  demand  will  change  (will  be  lower  ifχis  lower).
67:2171:155639:18:17:93:525:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence the shockχrepresents a “demand disturbance” to which it would be desirable
67:2172:155719:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to respond by lowering interest rates, if this is not precluded by the interest-rate lower

67:2176:155986:17:18:93:520:395:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:predictable from then on, as with all other exogenous variables.  We suppose thatRmτ
67:2177:156070:18:17:93:525:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and   ̃mτare both determined in subperiod 2 of periodτ−1.  Hence neitherRmtnor

67:2179:156232:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the stationary equilibrium.  ButRmτand   ̃mτcan both differ from their stationary

67:2181:156352:17:17:111:525:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For  simplicity,  we  shall  here  consider  only  policy  responses  to  the  shock  of  a

67:2183:156528:18:17:93:525:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monetary policy (that is, the choice ofRmτ+ 1 for allτ≥t+ 1) is used to ensure that

67:2186:156766:18:18:103:524:221:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:48Note  thatPt+1is  set  in  advance  on  the  basis  of  expectations  about  the  demand  for  normal
67:2187:156869:18:15:93:524:203:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:goods in periodt+ 1, which will depend on the interest rateRmt+2because of condition (2.15).  Thus
67:2188:156967:15:14:93:525:188:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the rule for settingRmτ+1in periodsτ≥t+ 1 can be used to ensure that the market-clearing price
67:2189:157061:14:14:93:524:174:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for normal goods in all periodsτ≥t+ 1 are consistent with the inflation target.  This desideratum
67:2190:157158:14:15:93:525:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:leaves the value ofRmt+1undetermined.  Note that the value ofPtreflects expectations about how
67:2191:157252:15:14:93:524:145:10:g_d0_f17:10:g_d0_f5:F:Rmt+1would be set;  but these are expectations about monetary policy in periodtthat were held
67:2192:157345:14:0:93:456:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:prior to the unexpected shock, that may not be confirmed, as a result of the shock.

68:2195:157593:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we consider to a two-parameter family, corresponding to different possible choices of
68:2196:157678:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Rmt+1and   ̃mt+1(both of which must be chosen in subperiod 2 of periodt, but which
68:2197:157760:18:17:93:262:637:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:may depend on the value ofχ).49
68:2198:157791:17:17:111:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because the pricePthas been fixed in advance, it is assumed to be independent
68:2199:157868:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the value ofχ,and equal to the price associated with the stationary equilibrium
68:2200:157950:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that had previously been expected to continue.  Once the shockχoccurs,  there is
68:2201:158030:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no further uncertainty about how the economy will evolve from then on (except the
68:2202:158111:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:uncertainty depicted in Figure 1).  Hence we may suppose that the pricePτof normal
68:2203:158193:18:17:93:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods in each periodτ≥t+ 1 is set so as to clear the market for normal goods in
68:2204:158272:17:17:93:525:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that period.  (While we assume thatPτmust be set prior to subperiod 2 of period
68:2205:158351:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:τ,we suppose that it is not set prior to subperiod 2 of periodτ−1.50)  Thus in the
68:2206:158433:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium considered in this section, the only period in which the market for normal

68:2209:158677:18:17:111:525:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:More generally,  we shall suppose that all variables that are determined in sub-

68:2220:159608:18:18:103:524:238:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:49For simplicity, in this section we abstract from the possible use of macroprudential policy, as in
68:2221:159708:18:9:93:426:220:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:sections 1-3; that is, we consider only equilibria in whichξt= 1 at all times.
68:2222:159786:9:18:103:524:211:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:50This means that the length of time for which prices are sticky is limited in the proposed model.
68:2223:159884:18:14:93:524:193:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:A  quantitatively  realistic  model  would  doubtless  need  to  allow  some  prices  to  remain  fixed  for  a

73:2393:168874:17:18:93:525:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decreasing function ofRm,a reduction ofRmt+1will increaseIt, as shown in the figure.
73:2394:168958:18:17:111:524:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It also follows from (5.6) and the fact that ˆφ1(λ;s,m) is a decreasing function of
73:2395:169041:17:17:93:525:287:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:sthatφ(λ;s, ̃m) is also a decreasing function ofs.  Thus the right-hand side of (5.4)
73:2396:169126:17:18:93:524:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is a decreasing function ofIt, for any fixed value of   ̃mt+1.Hence (5.4) establishes an

73:2398:169294:18:17:103:524:234:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:52Note that if the inequality (5.11) is reversed,  our model would imply that a reduction in the
73:2399:169390:17:15:93:524:217:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:interest rate on cash is associated with a decrease, rather than an increase, in aggregate demand.
73:2400:169488:15:14:93:525:202:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Condition (5.4) establishes an inverse relationship betweenλtandIt, regardless of whether (5.11)
73:2401:169584:14:15:93:524:188:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:holds;  so if a reduction ofRmt+1were associated with a reduction ofIt,  this would have to mean
73:2402:169680:15:14:93:524:173:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:an increase inλt, and hence a decrease in all three terms on the right-hand side of (5.1).  Such an
73:2403:169779:14:14:93:524:159:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:effect would be contrary to familiar evidence regarding the effects of interest-rate policy, and would
73:2404:169881:14:15:93:524:145:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:also preclude the possibility of a “liquidity trap” in which the lower bound on nominal interest rates
73:2405:169983:15:0:93:443:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:prevents rates from being cut enough to maintain a desired level of real activity.

74:2411:170461:17:17:93:310:249:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:imply an increase inYt,because of (5.1).53

75:2419:171050:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in which the collateral constraint binds, this will mean a correspondingly higher value

75:2422:171305:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the model,  it is indeed the case that reducing short-term nominal interest rates

75:2443:172979:18:17:93:524:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  this  equation,  for  any  given  value  of   ̃mt+1.In  addition,  (5.6)  together  with  the
75:2444:173076:17:17:93:525:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:result above that  ˆφ1(λ;s, ̃m) is a decreasing function of   ̃mimplies that the function

75:2446:173250:18:17:93:524:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of equation (5.4)) graphed in the lower part of Figure 10 shifts down as a result of
75:2447:173334:17:17:93:524:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an increase in   ̃mt+1,as shown in the figure.  It then follows thatλtis reduced by an
75:2448:173420:17:18:93:525:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase in   ̃mt+1,both because of the decrease inIt(the shift along the curve) and
75:2449:173504:18:17:93:524:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:because of the direct effect of an increase in   ̃mt+1(the downward shift of the curve).
75:2450:173592:17:0:111:524:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It follows that an increase in   ̃mt+1must loosen financial conditions, in the sense

76:2453:173852:18:35:93:404:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and on financial conditions as measured byλt(lower graph).
76:2454:173910:35:17:93:524:283:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:B:thatλtis reduced.  This in turn means that, as in the case of an interest-rate cut,Yt
76:2455:173995:17:17:93:524:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:must increase because of (5.1). Thus the effects of quantitative easing are qualitatively
76:2456:174084:17:18:93:524:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar to those of an interest-rate cut:  financial conditions are eased, the aggregate
76:2457:174172:18:17:93:524:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand for normal goods increases (both because of an increase in the demand for
76:2458:174252:17:17:93:524:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit goods and an increase in the demand for investment goods), but at the same
76:2459:174333:17:18:93:524:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time risks to financial stability increase,  because of an increase in short-term debt
76:2460:174419:18:17:93:524:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:issuance by banks, leading to larger expected distortions in the case that a crisis state
76:2461:174508:17:17:93:207:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:occurs in periodt+ 1.
76:2462:174529:17:0:111:525:145:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Nonetheless, the two policies do not have quantitatively equivalent effects.  If we
77:2463:174614:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:compare an interest-rate cut (reduction inRmt+1) and an increase in the net supply
77:2464:174696:18:17:93:525:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  safe  assets  by  the  central  bank  (increase  in   ̃mt+1)  that  increase  the  equilibrium

77:2466:174875:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by a greater amount.54This can be seen from the fact that (5.4) must apply in either
77:2467:174959:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case.  If, by hypothesis,Itincreases by the same amount in both cases, then the only
77:2468:175043:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference in the implied value forλtis that   ̃mt+1increases in the second case, but
77:2469:175128:17:18:93:525:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:remains constant in the first; and this implies a lower value ofλtin the second case.
77:2470:175213:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This means that in the case of quantitative easing, a greater share of the total increase
77:2471:175302:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in aggregate demand comes from increased demand for credit goods, as opposed to
77:2472:175381:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased demand for investment goods.  Thus a given degree of aggregate demand
77:2473:175460:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stimulus  can  be  achieved  with  less  risk  to  financial  stability  if  it  is  brought  about
77:2474:175559:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through an expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet, rather than by cutting the
77:2475:175643:17:18:93:227:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate paid on cash.
77:2476:175670:18:17:111:525:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We can also consider the effects of aggregate demand stimulus through relaxation

77:2478:175835:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysis presented in the earlier part of this section to allow for a macroprudential
77:2479:175920:18:17:93:525:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tax (or reserve requirement), so thatξtneed not equal 1 (as assumed thus far in this
77:2480:176004:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section).  Conditions (5.1), (5.3) and (5.4) continue to be required for an equilibrium,
77:2481:176092:17:18:93:525:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the definition of the function ˆφ1(λ;s, ̃m) is unchanged; but in (5.4), the expression
77:2482:176182:18:26:93:488:377:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:φ( ̄λ;F(It), ̃mt+1) must be replaced byφ( ̄λ;F(It), ̃mt+1,ξt+1), where we define
77:2483:176262:26:26:222:395:351:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A:φ(λ;s, ̃m,ξ)≡ˆφ(ξˆφ1(λ;s, ̃m);s),
77:2484:176295:26:18:93:185:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:generalizing (5.6).

77:2490:176409:33:27:93:312:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As above, this implicitly defines a function

77:2495:176748:18:14:93:525:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:achieve the same increase in investment (fromI1toI2) as the interest-rate cut in Figure 9.  The
77:2496:176843:14:0:93:328:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reduction inλtis instead larger (fromλ1toλ3< λ2).

78:2498:176982:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing to the right-hand side is shifted by changes in eitherRmt+1orξt+1.  To a linear
78:2499:177065:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approximation (which is to say, in the case of small enough policy changes), then, an
78:2500:177150:17:18:93:525:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase inξt+1(a relaxation of macroprudential policy, as by reducing the required
78:2501:177233:18:17:93:514:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:B:reserve ratio) has the same effects onItand  ̃φ1,t+1as a certain size of cut inRmt+1.
78:2502:177318:17:29:111:370:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We can also use (5.12) to rewrite (5.3) in the form
78:2503:177369:29:30:220:525:591:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:A:λt=β ̄λ ̄φ1(It,Rmt+1,ξt+1)Rmt+1/Π.(5.13)
78:2504:177409:30:17:93:524:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:From this it follows that since a relaxation of macroprudential policy reduces the value
78:2505:177497:17:17:93:524:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  ̃φ1,t+1, it must reduce the value ofλt.  Hence it increases demand for credit goods,
78:2506:177585:17:18:93:524:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and so must increaseYt, like the other two policies just considered.  But it also follows
78:2507:177674:18:17:93:525:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from (5.13) that in the case of two policy changes (a cut inRmt+1or an increase inξt+1)
78:2508:177761:17:17:93:525:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that reduce   ̃φ1,t+1to the same extent, and that therefore reduce   ̄φ1(It,Rmt+1,ξt+1) to
78:2509:177851:17:18:93:524:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the same extent, the interest-rate cut must reduceλtby more, and so must stimulate
78:2510:177933:18:17:93:524:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand  for  credit  goods  to  a  greater  extent.   Thus  an  even  greater  share  of  the
78:2511:178026:17:17:93:524:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase  in  aggregate  demand  achieved  by  relaxing  macroprudential  policy  comes
78:2512:178113:17:18:93:524:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from an increase in investment demand, as opposed to an increase in the demand for
78:2513:178195:18:17:93:524:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:credit goods, than in the case of an increase in aggregate demand achieved by cutting
78:2514:178280:17:17:93:221:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the interest rate on cash.
78:2515:178306:17:18:111:525:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We can therefore order the three types of expansionary policy:  for a given degree
78:2516:178388:18:17:93:524:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of increase in aggregate demand, achieving it by increasing   ̃mt+1increasesItthe least,
78:2517:178476:17:17:93:524:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:achieving it by reducingRmt+1increasesItto an intermediate extent, and achieving
78:2518:178556:17:18:93:525:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it by increasingξt+1increasesIt(and hence short-term debt issuance by banks, and
78:2519:178636:18:17:93:524:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risks  to  financial  stability)  the  most.   One  consequence  of  this  is  that  increasing
78:2520:178731:17:17:93:525:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate demand through monetary policyneed notinvolve any increased risks to
78:2521:178809:17:18:93:525:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability at all.  For example, one might combine an increase in   ̃mt+1with
78:2522:178895:18:17:93:524:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  tightening  of  macroprudential  policy  (reduction  ofξt+1)  that  exactly  offsets  the
78:2523:178987:17:17:93:524:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects of the quantitative easing on desired investment demand, so that there is no
78:2524:179071:17:18:93:524:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:net change inIt.  Since the former policy change will reduceλtmore than the latter
78:2525:179153:18:17:93:524:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policy change increases it, the net effect will be a loosening of financial conditions,
78:2526:179240:17:17:93:524:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and an increase in the demand for credit goods.  Since there is (by hypothesis) no
78:2527:179322:17:18:93:525:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change in investment demand, aggregate demandYtwill increase; but there will be

79:2530:179534:0:18:111:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude that while quantitative easingmayincrease risks to financial stabil-

79:2533:179784:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank’s balance sheet is combined with an increase in the interest rate paid on cash, or
79:2534:179871:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a tightening of macroprudential policy to a sufficient extent, it can increase aggregate
79:2535:179959:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand without any adverse consequences for financial stability.  It is particularly
79:2536:180043:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easy to achieve this outcome by combining the quantitative easing with macropruden-

79:2540:180374:18:17:111:525:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:These results imply that quantitative easing may be a useful addition to a central

79:2543:180625:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contractionary shockχ,the effects on aggregate demand can be offset purely through
79:2544:180707:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  reduction  inRmt+1,if  the  lower  bound  does  not  prevent  the  size  of  rate  cut  that
79:2545:180802:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  needed;  but  such  a  response  increases  risks  to  financial  stability  more  than  is
79:2546:180897:18:17:93:525:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:necessary.  One could alternatively counter the effects of theχshock by increasing
79:2547:180979:17:17:95:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: ̃mt+1,while leavingRmt+1unchanged; and this would have the advantage of posing less
79:2548:181063:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a threat to financial stability.  Even better, one could combine a somewhat larger
79:2549:181148:18:17:93:525:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase in   ̃mt+1with a tightening of macroprudential policy, allowing the effects of
79:2550:181235:17:17:93:525:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:theχshock on aggregate demand to be offset, with even less of an increased risk to
79:2551:181317:17:45:93:291:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability, possibly none at all.
79:2552:181359:45:29:93:222:298:17:g_d0_f7:17:g_d0_f7:C:6    Conclusions
79:2553:181375:29:17:93:524:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We can now assess the validity of the concerns about the consequences of quantitative
79:2554:181460:17:18:93:524:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing for financial stability sketched in the introduction, in the light of the model
79:2555:181546:18:17:93:524:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:just presented.  Our model is one in which monetary policy does indeed influence risks
79:2556:181632:17:17:93:524:217:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to financial stability; in particular, policies that loosen financial conditions, either by
79:2557:181723:17:18:93:524:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lowering the central bank’s operating target for its policy rate (conventional monetary
79:2558:181810:18:17:93:524:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policy), or by relaxing reserve requirements (or other macro-prudential constraints),
79:2559:181895:17:17:93:524:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:should each increase the attractiveness of private issuance of “money-like” liabilities,
79:2560:181983:17:18:93:524:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:resulting  in  increased  leverage  and  as  a  consequence  an  increased  risk  of  serious
79:2561:182076:18:0:93:524:130:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:resource  misallocation  in  the  event  of  a  funding  crisis.   This  means  that  there  can
80:2562:182174:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at times be a tension between the monetary policy that would be preferable strictly
80:2563:182257:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the standpoint of aggregate demand management and inflation stabilization, on
80:2564:182339:17:17:93:486:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the one hand, and the policy that would minimize risks to financial stability.
80:2565:182417:17:18:111:525:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The question is whether it is correct to think of quantitative easing as a policy
80:2566:182498:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analogous to these, and hence that poses similar risks to financial stability. Our model
80:2567:182586:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:implies that such an analogy is imperfect. A quantitative easing policy (increasing the
80:2568:182673:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:public supply of safe assets, by issuing additional safe liabilities of the central bank,
80:2569:182762:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:used to purchase assets that do not earn a similar safety premium) similarly increases
80:2570:182848:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate demand by lowering the equilibrium rate of return on non-safe assets.  But
80:2571:182932:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unlike conventional monetary policy, it does this by lowering the equilibrium safety
80:2572:183016:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premium (by making safe assets less scarce), rather than by lowering the equilibrium
80:2573:183100:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:return  on  safe  assets;  and  this  does  not  have  the  same  consequences  for  financial
80:2574:183194:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stability.  Lowering the equilibrium return on risky investments (such as the “durable
80:2575:183280:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods” modeled here, which one may think of as housing) by lowering the return on
80:2576:183361:17:17:93:525:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:safe assets works only insofar as theincreasedspread between the two returns that
80:2577:183442:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would result if the return on risky investments did not also fall increases the incentive
80:2578:183531:18:17:93:524:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to finance additional risky investment by issuing safe liabilities, thus increasing the
80:2579:183618:17:17:93:524:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:leverage of the banks and the degree to which they engage in liquidity transformation;
80:2580:183704:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this results in a reduced equilibrium return on risky investment, but not by enough
80:2581:183787:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  fully  eliminate  the  increased  spread  that  induces  banks  to  issue  additional  safe
80:2582:183882:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset-backed  liabilities.   This  mechanism  necessarily  increases  the  risk  to  financial
80:2583:183976:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stability  at  the  same  time  as  it  increases  aggregate  demand.   Quantitative  easing
80:2584:184068:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insteaddecreasesthe  spread  between  these  two  returns,  at  least  in  the  absence  of
80:2585:184159:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:any  change  in  the  private  supply  of  safe  liabilities.   This  reduction  in  the  spread
80:2586:184255:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduces the incentive for private issuance of such liabilities, and reduced issuance of
80:2587:184342:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:safe asset-backed liabilities by banks offsets some of the reduction in the spread, but
80:2588:184429:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not completely eliminate it as otherwise banks would not have a reason to reduce
80:2589:184514:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their issuance.  Hence in this case the reduction in the equilibrium return on risky
80:2590:184598:18:17:93:525:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investments is associated with areductionof the incentive for liquidity transformation
80:2591:184684:17:17:93:268:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by banks, rather than an increase.
80:2592:184718:17:18:111:525:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly, quantitative easing increases the total supply of safe assets and so re-
80:2593:184801:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:duces the safety premium; but unlike a reduction in reserve requirements (or relax-
80:2594:184884:17:17:93:524:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ation of macroprudential policy), it achieves this by increasing the public supply of
80:2595:184969:17:0:93:524:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:safe assets (and actually reducing the incentive for private issuance), rather than by
81:2596:185057:0:18:93:524:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increasing the incentive that banks have to finance risky investment by issuing safe
81:2597:185141:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asset-backed liabilities.  Again the consequences for the degree of liquidity transfor-
81:2598:185228:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mation by the banking sector, and hence the risk to financial stability, are entirely
81:2599:185313:17:18:93:139:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different.
81:2600:185323:18:17:111:525:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Likewise, it is true that quantitative easing eases financial conditions by reducing
81:2601:185407:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the spread between the required return on risky investments and the return on safe
81:2602:185489:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assets; but this does not mean that risk premia are “artificially” reduced in a way that
81:2603:185577:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distorts incentives for prudent behavior, leading to excessive risk-taking. In the model
81:2604:185665:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:presented here, quantitative easing reduces the safety premium, but because the pub-
81:2605:185749:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lic supply of safe assets for private investors to hold is increased,  and not because
81:2606:185835:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:anyone  is  misled  into  under-estimating  the  degree  of  risk  involved  in  undertaking
81:2607:185927:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risky investments.  Moreover, the reduced spread reduces the incentive for private is-
81:2608:186013:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suance of safe liabilities, and instead favors financing of investment through issuance
81:2609:186100:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of non-safe liabilities, which is desirable on financial stability grounds.  Rather than
81:2610:186188:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:threatening financial stability by encouraging more risk-taking, it favors it by encour-
81:2611:186276:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aging forms of financing that reduce the magnitude of the distortions associated with
81:2612:186361:18:17:93:174:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a funding crisis.
81:2613:186378:17:17:111:525:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our model, we can compare the effects of three alternative policies that can in-
81:2614:186461:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:crease aggregate demand by easing financial conditions:  reducing the central bank’s
81:2615:186545:18:17:93:524:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:operating target for the nominal interest rate on safe assets (conventional monetary
81:2616:186629:17:17:93:524:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policy,  on  the  assumption  that  the  zero  lower  bound  does  not  yet  preclude  such
81:2617:186720:17:18:93:524:343:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:easing),  relaxing reserve requirements (or other macro-prudential constraints),  and
81:2618:186805:18:17:93:524:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative easing.  We find that among these, quantitative easing is the policy that
81:2619:186891:17:17:93:524:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases risks to financial stability the least, for any given degree of increase in aggre-
81:2620:186983:17:18:93:524:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gate demand.  Not only does quantitative easing make it possible for a central bank
81:2621:187066:18:17:93:524:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to increase aggregate demand even when conventional monetary policy is constrained
81:2622:187148:17:17:93:524:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, but it is possible, at least in prin-
81:2623:187236:17:18:93:524:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ciple, to increase aggregate demand without the collateral effect of an increased risk
81:2624:187322:18:17:93:524:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  financial  stability,  if  the  increased  supply  of  safe  liabilities  by  the  central  bank
81:2625:187422:17:17:93:524:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  combined  with  a  sufficient  tightening  of  macroprudential  measures.   (The  latter
81:2626:187514:17:18:93:524:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures would by themselves reduce aggregate demand;  but when combined with
81:2627:187591:18:17:93:524:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative easing, the net effect is an increase in aggregate demand, even when the
81:2628:187676:17:17:93:524:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:degree of macroprudential tightening is enough to fully offset any increase in risks to
81:2629:187763:17:0:93:385:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial stability as a result of the balance-sheet policy.)
82:2630:187826:0:18:111:525:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This indicates that a concern for the effects of monetary policy on financial sta-
82:2631:187908:18:17:93:524:689:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bility need not preclude using quantitative easing to stimulate aggregate demand in
82:2632:187991:17:17:93:524:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:circumstances where (as in the US in the aftermath of the recent crisis) conventional
82:2633:188076:17:18:93:524:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound.  In fact,  the fact that de-
82:2634:188160:18:17:93:524:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mand stimulus through quantitative easing poses smaller risks to financial stability
82:2635:188244:17:17:93:524:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than demand stimulus through lowering short-term nominal interest rates suggests
82:2636:188324:17:18:93:524:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that balance-sheet policy may be a useful tool of monetary stabilization policy even
82:2637:188408:18:17:93:524:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when a central bank is far from the zero lower bound.  In the model presented here,
82:2638:188491:17:17:93:524:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate demand stimulus achieved by lowering nominal interest rates increases the
82:2639:188574:17:18:93:524:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:risk to financial stability more than would a quantitative easing policy that is equally
82:2640:188662:18:17:93:524:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effective  in  increasing  aggregate  demand.   This  implies  that  (even  if  macropruden-
82:2641:188754:17:17:93:524:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tial  policy  is  unavailable  or  ineffective)  it  should  be  possible  to  increase  aggregate
82:2642:188852:17:18:93:524:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand without increasing the risk to financial stability by combining expansionary
82:2643:188935:18:17:93:524:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance-sheet policy with an appropriate size ofincreasein the policy rate.  In such
82:2644:189019:17:17:93:524:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a case, conventional monetary policy would essentially be used for macroprudential
82:2645:189101:17:18:93:524:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:purposes (to control the risk to financial stability) while balance-sheet policy is used
82:2646:189189:18:17:93:221:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for demand stabilization.

82:2648:189298:17:18:93:524:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be warranted, not simply for the sake of having a more effective policy toolkit for use
