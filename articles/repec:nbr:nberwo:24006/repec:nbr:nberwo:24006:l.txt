2:30:1587:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  consider  the  life  cycle  choices  of  a  household  that  in  each  period  decides  how  much  to 
2:31:1693:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:consume and  how  to  allocate  spouses'  time  to  work,  leisure,  and  childcare.  In  an  environment 
2:32:1798:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:with  uncertainty, the  allocation  of  goods  and  time  over  the  life  cycle  also  serves  the  purpose  of 
2:33:1910:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:smoothing  marginal utility  in  response  to  shocks.  We  combine  data  on  consumption,  spouses' 
2:34:2011:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:wages, hours of work, and time spent with children to estimate the sensitivity of consumption and 
2:35:2108:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:time allocation to transitory and permanent wage shocks. These structural parameters describe the 
2:36:2205:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:ability  of  household  to  self-insure in  response  to  shocks.  We  find  that  behavioral  responses  to 
2:37:2313:14:14:72:543:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:wage  shocks  depend  on  the  presence  of young  children.  We  also  find  that  labor  supply  cross-
2:38:2417:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:responses depend on three counteracting forces: complementarity of leisure time, substitutability 
2:39:2514:14:42:72:402:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:of time in the production of child services, and added worker effects.

3:59:2953:0:30:72:185:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:60:2968:30:19:93:539:678:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In a series of seminal contributions, Becker (1965) and Ghez and Becker (1975), emphasized
3:61:3058:19:19:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the importance of understanding the e§ect of children on how households allocate goods and time
3:62:3153:19:19:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over the life cycle. To quote from Ghez and Becker (1975), ìThe parentís utility function is assumed
3:63:3253:19:19:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to depend not only on [consumption of goods], but also on commodities measuring child services
3:64:3347:19:19:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:[...] The raising of children requires time, especially wifeís time, and goods. Thus, time and goods
3:65:3447:19:19:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:must be allocated between child services and other commodities.îOne conclusion of that research
3:66:3542:19:19:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was that children change the optimal allocation of parentsítime to work in the paid labor market,
3:67:3639:19:19:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure, and childcare. Responses to wage and income changes di§er across households depending
3:68:3733:19:19:72:397:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the importance of ëchild servicesíin the parental utility function.
3:69:3803:19:19:86:539:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In an environment with uncertainty, the allocation of goods and time over the life cycle also has
3:70:3900:19:19:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the goal of smoothing the marginal utility of wealth in the face of shocks to household resources.
3:71:3998:19:19:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The key parameters governing the ability to smooth marginal utility are the Frisch and Marshallian
3:72:4096:19:19:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(own- and cross-) consumption and labor supply elasticities.  For example, a low consumption
3:73:4188:19:19:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Frisch elasticity (a low willingness to accept intertemporal áuctuations in consumption) implies a
3:74:4286:19:19:72:540:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:greater desire to smooth consumption relative to, e.g., a case in which the elasticity is high. A
3:75:4383:19:19:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:permanent wage shock faced by the primary earner can be insured through added worker e§ects
3:76:4474:19:19:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., increased work of secondary earners). This stabilization e§ect, reáected in the Marshallian
3:77:4572:19:19:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity, is stronger the higher the Frisch elasticity of the secondary earner. But since an increase
3:78:4675:19:18:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in hours of work reduces the amount of time that can be allocated to the production of childcare
3:79:4771:18:19:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:services, it is clear that there are important trade-o§s between producing childcare services and
3:80:4868:19:19:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insuring consumption against shocks. Combining these two issues (the importance of children in
3:81:4962:19:19:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shaping preferences and the demand for insurance) in a uniÖed framework is the goal of this paper.
3:82:5060:19:19:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To our knowledge, this is the Örst paper that attempts to put together these two distinct literatures.
3:83:5162:19:19:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Some of the decomposition exercises we discuss below derive precisely from the goal of isolating the
3:84:5262:19:19:72:538:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinct forces a§ecting the choice of how to allocate time in response to di§erent types of events.
3:85:5362:19:19:86:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To address these goals, we adopt a structural life-cycle approach in which a married couple
3:86:5453:19:19:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decides how much to consume and how to allocate available time to work activities, leisure, and
3:87:5548:19:19:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children (if present).  Husband and wife choose time to devote to children as inputs of a home
3:88:5642:19:19:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production function for child care. This framework departs signiÖcantly from our previous work
3:89:5736:19:19:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(Blundell et al., 2016) both because it explicitly takes into account the ináuence of children on
3:90:5833:19:0:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and time allocation decisions of husband and wife, and because it is based on a fully
4:91:5931:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:structural approach rather than on approximations to the Örst order conditions and the lifetime
4:92:6026:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:budget constraints. This allows us to fully account for liquidity constraints and extensive margin
4:93:6124:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions on time use - which are likely extremely important for younger households with children.
4:94:6222:19:19:86:539:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The relation between the hours of husband and hours of wife (as well as the relation between their
4:95:6320:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hours and the spending on goods) can be generated by home production‡ laBecker (leisure time
4:96:6412:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the two spouses, as well as market goods, are inputs in the production of "commodities") or by
4:97:6509:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:formal non-separabilities in the utility function (the marginal utility of leisure of one spouse depends
4:98:6613:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the leisure time of the other - i.e., spouses may enjoy leisure more when they are together). The
4:99:6713:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relationship may also be a§ected by joint progressive taxation of earnings or correlation of wage
4:100:6810:19:19:72:279:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks (both of which we model explicitly).
4:101:6853:19:19:86:539:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In general, we might expect spouses to want to spend time together. Indeed, it is very likely
4:102:6946:19:19:72:539:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the complementarity of time together provides a key incentive for relationships to form.1We
4:103:7042:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:do not directly model family formation, but in order to capture the fact that people have preference
4:104:7142:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for spending time together or with their children (a public good), we consider the possibility that
4:105:7241:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preferences are non-separable and complementary over leisure times. In Blundell et al. (2016) we
4:106:7337:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:found evidence of Frisch complementarity for time within couples, although we did not relate this
4:107:7434:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to children or measures of time use. However, we found that family labor supply provides insurance
4:108:7532:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:against persistent wage shocks, and that family leisure times were Marshallian substitutes. When
4:109:7628:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it comes to the care of children, however, there is potentially more room for specialization. For
4:110:7725:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:example, it is possible that more e¢ cient technologies require people to separate their time between
4:111:7826:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:various activities, especially in the presence of multiple children or children of di§erent ages. In the
4:112:7930:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:absence of time use data, it is hard to verify whether covariation in the hours of work of husband
4:113:8028:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and wife descends from explicit non-separability in utility or from the e§ect of home production.
4:114:8125:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As Browning, Chiappori and Weiss (2014) write, "the production function... cannot be estimated
4:115:8219:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:independently of the utility function unless the home-produced commodities are independently
4:116:8311:19:19:72:130:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observable".
4:117:8323:19:18:86:539:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To address these issues we derive structural marginal rate of substitution relations between
4:118:8415:18:16:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure time of the two partners, the time they allocate to child care, consumption, and prices
4:119:8510:16:20:84:539:180:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:1Becker (1976) attributed the existence of marriage to "the desire to raise own children" (p. 211), which requires
4:120:8624:20:15:72:540:160:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:complementarity of the spousesí leisure time.  As he noticed, "Sexual gratiÖcation, cleaning, feeding, and other
4:121:8736:15:15:72:539:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:services can be purchased, but notownchildren: both the man and the woman are required to produce their own
4:122:8843:15:16:71:539:130:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:children and perhaps to raise them" (p. 210), and later, that "complementarity between men and women is the major
4:123:8956:16:0:71:246:114:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:source of the gain from marriage" (p. 211).

5:126:9182:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(ATUS), and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). We use the latter to impute consumption
5:127:9272:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to all household units in the ATUS (where no consumption information is available). We then use
5:128:9367:19:19:72:467:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:numerical simulation of the model to recover the remaining preference parameters.
5:129:9448:19:19:86:539:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The PSID and the ATUS are rich in some aspects but have also important drawbacks. The PSID
5:130:9538:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contains panel data on consumption, assets, hours of work and hourly wages for both earners, but
5:131:9634:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it does not have consistent information on child care time. During our sample period a special
5:132:9728:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:module (the Child Development Survey, CDS) collects time use data for children (including time
5:133:9822:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:they spend with their parents). Unfortunately, the CDS is available only occasionally, parental
5:134:9917:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time use has to be inferred from children time use, and the module does not cover all children in
5:135:10014:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the household (in particular, it does not cover young children in later waves). For this reason, we
5:136:10113:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use the PSID to recover parameters when child care time is zero by deÖnition (as in families with
5:137:10210:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no young children). From an identiÖcation point of view, households with no young children are
5:138:10304:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:important because for them we expect only complementarity of leisure to be important, since no
5:139:10398:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production of child services occurs. Unlike the PSID, the ATUS contains detailed information on
5:140:10493:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time use (including child care) and on hourly wages for the main respondent, but lacks information
5:141:10591:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on time use or hourly wage for the partner, and no information on household consumption. We
5:142:10682:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:then impute this information using cohort-education-year average values of parental time and hourly
5:143:10781:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wages (from the ATUS male respondents), and household consumption (from the CEX). Time use
5:144:10871:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data bring very useful additional information that allows us to separately identify key aspects of
5:145:10969:19:19:72:250:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the production of ëchildcare servicesí.
5:146:11008:19:19:86:539:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our structural estimates can be used to provide a comprehensive picture of the ability of house-
5:147:11104:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:holds to smooth marginal utility in response to shocks. In addition, information on hours of work
5:148:11201:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and hours spent on childcare allows to decompose overall Frisch cross-responses into two compo-
5:149:11296:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nents, one reáecting the potential degree of complementarity between husbandís and wifeís leisure
5:150:11393:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(demand for "companionship" or "love") and another reáecting the degree of substitutability of
5:151:11487:18:19:72:353:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their childcare time in the production of childcare services.
5:152:11548:19:19:86:539:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Using simulations from our estimated model, we Önd that this decomposition is important.
5:153:11636:19:19:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While overall cross-Frisch responses of hours are small, the responses of the two sub-utility margins
5:154:11737:19:19:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are of opposite signs, highlighting the tension between substitutability and complementarity in
5:155:11832:19:0:72:540:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:driving the hours response. In particular, the hours of work of young mothers appear to respond
6:156:11928:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:little to an increase in the maleís temporary wage (which induces an increase in his hours) because
6:157:12027:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the force that pushes her to reduce her leisure time (or work longer) due to the lower leisure time
6:158:12126:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of her companion, is counteracted by the force that pushes her to increase childcare time because
6:159:12223:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the husband is now allocating fewer hours to child-raising and her time is a substitute for his time
6:160:12323:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the household production of childcare services. Similarly, own (especially female) responses are
6:161:12422:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:large because they include both an intertemporal substitution component and a home production
6:162:12515:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:component - when wages are temporarily higher the opportunity cost of an extra hour of leisure and
6:163:12613:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an extra hour of childcare increases. Ignoring the interaction between children and time use when
6:164:12710:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:modeling family labor supply thus misses important components of the adjustments in consumption
6:165:12805:19:19:72:441:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and time use that families undertake in response to shocks to their resources.
6:166:12883:19:19:86:539:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model can be used to simulate behavior in counterfactual scenarios.  We compare two
6:167:12970:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:revenue-neutral policies that have direct e§ects on the welfare of households with children. In one
6:168:13069:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:case we provide households with young children with an unconditional subsidy. In another, we
6:169:13161:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:compensate households with young children for the child-related Öxed costs of work they face. We
6:170:13257:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Önd that both policies relieve households, in the pre-children period, from saving in anticipation
6:171:13355:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the decline in family earnings induced by the wife reallocating time from market to childcare
6:172:13451:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when children arrive. We also Önd that the unconditional subsidy policy has greater welfare value
6:173:13548:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than the policy that compensates for the Öxed costs of work. This is partly due to the "no-strings-
6:174:13647:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attached" nature of the Örst policy, and partly because of the dynamics induced by credit market
6:175:13743:19:19:72:114:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:frictions.
6:176:13753:19:19:86:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This paper is related to a large literature that studies family labor supply. SpeciÖcally, there
6:177:13849:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are two strands of research: papers that consider the impact of children on female labor supply,
6:178:13945:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and those that examine the role of labor supply as an insurance against shocks - in particular, wage
6:179:14045:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks. In the Örst line of work there are papers that establish a clear relationship between the
6:180:14142:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presence of children and female labor supply, such as Angrist and Evans (1998). Attanasio, Low
6:181:14236:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Sanchez-Marcos (2008) study the role of decreasing childcare prices in explaining changes in
6:182:14332:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:female participation rates across cohorts. Other papers use time diary data to examine the precise
6:183:14430:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decomposition of available time between children and other activities (Aguiar and Hurst, 2007;
6:184:14524:19:19:72:539:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis 2013; Ramey and Ramey, 2010).2In the second line of work,
6:185:14613:19:17:71:539:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Hyslop (2001), Attanasio, Low and Sanchez-Marcos (2005), and Blundell et al. (2016) are some

7:188:14836:0:19:72:211:708:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:representative contributions.3
7:189:14866:19:19:86:539:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper makes three key contributions. The Örst contribution is methodological. We incor-
7:190:14957:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:porate consumption and time use activities of husband and wife in a dynamic life-cycle model with
7:191:15054:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty about their underlying wages, liquidity constraints and heterogeneity of preferences.
7:192:15151:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We then show how to derive marginal rate of substitution relations between leisure of the two part-
7:193:15250:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ners, and consumption. Controlling for the latter is an implicit way to control for the unobservable
7:194:15350:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal utility of wealth (as done by Altonji, 1986, in a single-earner labor supply context). Simi-
7:195:15451:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:larly, we can derive a structural marginal rate of substitution relation linking child care time of the
7:196:15554:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two partners and consumption. With appropriate selection corrections and instruments, we show
7:197:15647:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:how to identify the parameters characterizing utility and the child care production function. Model
7:198:15746:19:19:72:526:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:simulations can then be used to recover the remaining parameters (mostly, preference shifters).
7:199:15841:19:19:86:539:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our second contribution is in the context of the family labor supply literature. We demonstrate,
7:200:15937:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:both theoretically and empirically, how the presence of young children in the household gives rise to
7:201:16038:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity in the (own- and cross-) elasticities of labor supply to wage shocks. Using our data, we
7:202:16140:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provide new evidence on the decomposition of labor supply elasticities to their leisure and childcare
7:203:16241:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time sources, especially highlighting the tension between spousesí leisure complementarity and
7:204:16335:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time substitutability. Our third contribution is to the consumption smoothing literature.
7:205:16434:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Using our estimates for the labor supply elasticities, we show that the heterogeneity in labor supply
7:206:16535:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities which is driven by the presence of young kids translates into heterogeneity in the use of
7:207:16637:19:19:72:251:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market hours to smooth wage shocks.
7:208:16672:19:19:86:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 describes the life cycle problem of the household.
7:209:16764:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section 3 discusses the derivation of the moment conditions we use in estimation, as well as the
7:210:16860:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decomposition of labor supply elasticities. Section 4 describes the PSID, ATUS and CEX data,
7:211:16952:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:while Section 5 discusses estimation and parameterization. The results, the discussion about the
7:212:17048:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relation between childcare and wages, as well as the implications of the results for the degree of
7:213:17146:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:insurance are in Section 6. In this section we also discuss the role of credit constraints in shaping
7:214:17247:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses. In Section 7 we discuss the results of the two policy experiments described above (a
7:215:17342:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy to child care cost and a compensation for child-related Öxed costs of work).  Section 8
7:216:17437:19:14:72:121:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:concludes.
7:217:17447:14:19:84:539:163:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:3The "added worker e§ect" literature studies in particular how the wifeís employment responds to the husbandís
7:218:17557:19:0:72:494:144:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:unemployment events. See for example Lundberg (1985), Stephens, (2002), and Juhn and Potter (2007).
8:219:17657:0:30:72:496:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2  A Life Cycle Model with Childcare Production Function
8:220:17713:30:19:93:539:678:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this section we discuss a life cycle problem faced by a couple.  We consider a unitary
8:221:17802:19:19:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:framework in which the household draws utility from the leisure times of the spouses, from the con-
8:222:17901:19:19:72:539:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sumption of non-childcare related goods, and from "child commodities".4The latter are produced
8:223:17995:19:19:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using as inputs the hours that husband and wife devote to their children (allowing for observable
8:224:18092:19:19:72:539:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and unobserved heterogeneity).5For simplicity, we assume that fertility decision are exogenous.
8:225:18187:19:19:72:543:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, the householdís problem is to choose consumption and the allocation of the two membersí
8:226:18280:19:19:72:381:564:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:total hours to three activities: work, childcare time, and leisure.6
8:227:18348:19:19:86:539:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We assume throughout that the hourly wage process is exogenous; we also allow wage shocks
8:228:18437:19:19:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to be potentially correlated across spouses. As we highlight, the model shows that the response
8:229:18532:19:19:72:539:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of family labor supply to shocks is rather complex,7as it depends on the spousesíelasticities for
8:230:18629:19:19:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(responsiveness of) leisure and childcare time to wage changes, the degree of complementarity of
8:231:18725:19:19:72:540:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their leisure times in utility, the degree of substitutability of childcare time inputs in the production

8:235:19057:34:26:72:184:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.1  Wage Process
8:236:19074:26:19:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Similarly to Blundell et al.  (2016), we assume that each earnerís wage process contains both
8:237:19167:19:19:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a permanent and a transitory component. The permanent component evolves as a random walk
8:238:19255:19:19:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:process, while the transitory component is serially uncorrelated. The distinction between transitory
8:239:19355:19:19:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks and permanent shocks is important, as in a frictionless world with interior solutions one can
8:240:19455:19:19:72:540:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interpret transitory shocks as having negligible or no wealth e§ects on labor choices.  Hence in
8:241:19551:19:17:72:539:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this special case, the response of hours to transitory wage shocks identiÖes Frisch (or--constant)
8:242:19649:17:12:84:484:240:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:A:4See Chiappori and Mazzocco, 2017, for a recent survey of collective models of family labor supply.
8:243:19748:12:19:84:539:228:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:5Such heterogeneity may capture the ináuence of other inputs, such as expenditure on toys, books, etc., that we
8:244:19859:19:9:72:167:209:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:do not model explicitly.
8:245:19883:9:19:84:539:200:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:6We consider only three possible uses of time (childcare, leisure, work) for the two earners in the household. This
8:246:19998:19:15:72:540:181:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is of course a simplifying assumption, but consistent with our goal to focus and highlight in this paper the interaction
8:247:20118:15:16:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:between children and labor supply. In practice, what we call "leisure" may subsume multiple adjustment margins in
8:248:20231:16:8:72:482:150:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:response to changes in resources (housework being the most obvious example), besides "pure leisure".
8:249:20331:8:19:84:539:142:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:7As Heckman (1988) notes, in a model with multiple time uses of non-market time, retrictions on the wifeís time
8:250:20442:19:0:72:363:123:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:in one activity need not imply wage- and income- inelastic labor supply.
9:251:20515:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities, while the response to permanent wage shocks identiÖes Marshallian (or uncompensated)
9:252:20613:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities. However, since labor supply behavior of individuals (especially women) is characterized
9:253:20714:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by corner solutions, and since households may face frictions in credit markets, it is important to
9:254:20812:19:19:72:532:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:focus more generally on labor supply elasticities in response to wage changes of di§erent nature.
9:255:20909:19:30:86:486:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We assume that the log of real wage of earnerj=f1;2gat agetcan be written as:

9:259:21129:19:19:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transitory and permanent shocks, respectively. We assume that transitory and permanent innova-
9:260:21223:19:19:72:539:512:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:tions are uncorrelated within person. However, they may be potentially correlated across spouses.8
9:261:21321:19:19:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The structure of markets is such that shocks are not formally insurable, household have no advance

9:264:21606:19:19:86:539:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Given the speciÖcation of the wage process (1)-(2) the growth in (residual) log wages can be

9:269:21843:35:26:71:222:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.2  Household Decisions
9:270:21867:26:16:71:349:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Households solve the following problem over the life cycle:
9:271:21926:16:19:84:539:277:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:8This is potentially important since several empirical papers Önd evidence of a correlation between the labor
9:272:22035:19:9:72:466:258:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:market outcomes of married couples. See for example Juhn and Potter (2007) and Hyslop (2001).
9:273:22128:9:19:84:539:249:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:9This is a key assumption in the context of empirical analysis on consumption insurance. See Meghir and Pistaferri
9:274:22242:19:8:72:499:230:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:(2011) for a discussion about the interpretation of insurance coe¢ cients when this assumption is violated.
9:275:22349:8:19:80:539:222:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:10We assume that both husband and wifeís o§ered wages change over the life cycle to capture, in a reduced form
9:276:22459:19:16:72:540:203:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:fashion, the e§ect of human capital accumulation. We do not allow, however, for wages to increase with labor market
9:277:22574:16:15:72:540:187:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:experience (i.e., cumulated periods of work) or decline with periods out of work - which would induce a feedback
9:278:22686:15:15:72:540:172:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:between labor supply decisions and future wages. See Attanasio et al. (2008) for examples with female labor supply.
9:279:22801:15:16:72:540:157:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:The assumption of exogenous wages may potentially impact our estimates of added worker e§ects, since in a world
9:280:22912:16:15:72:540:141:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:with endogenous wages secondary earners may have greater incentives to respond, since "waiting" to respond to
9:281:23021:15:0:72:444:126:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:shocks reduces future wages and hence the stabilizing power of the added workerís earnings.

10:295:23694:19:19:86:539:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We introduce two sets of demographic conditioning variables in the utility function. The Örst,
10:296:23788:19:19:71:539:440:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:z, contains the number of kids and their age composition. We model childcare time, leisure and
10:297:23882:19:19:71:539:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:labor supply decisions as explicit functions ofz. Since these family composition variables a§ect
10:298:23978:19:19:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption in ways not captured by our model (i.e., not only through childcare), we let the e§ect

10:300:24175:19:19:71:539:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for actual functional forms). The second set of conditioning variables,", includes unobservable taste

11:376:26929:19:19:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the family. Second, it allows for non-separability of female labor supply and consumption through
11:377:27029:19:19:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the introduction of a Öxed cost of work (which is typically observed in formal estimation, see Cogan

11:380:27235:12:19:80:539:131:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:12In principle, the model could be identiÖed even with other forms of non-separabilities (for example, non-

13:467:30993:19:19:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal rate of substitution between childcare time of the two spouses, while (8) is the marginal
13:468:31091:19:19:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate of substitution between the childcare time of the wife and household consumption. An increase
13:469:31189:19:19:72:540:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the relative cost of her time would induce a decline in her childcare time, relative to his childcare
13:470:31293:19:19:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time. Since the PSID lacks information on parental time, we estimate these two moment conditions
13:471:31389:19:19:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using the ATUS. However, we face two missing data problems. First, ATUS collects detailed time
13:472:31483:19:19:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use information only for one respondent in the household. Hence, if we focus on female respondents
13:473:31581:19:19:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and observet2;t, we have no information on the husbandís parental time,t1;t. We hence impute
13:474:31673:19:19:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the latter from the sample of ATUS male respondents (conditioning on the wifeís demographic
13:475:31764:19:19:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics). The second missing data problem is that, unlike the PSID, there is no consumption
13:476:31863:19:19:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information in the ATUS. We thus impute consumption using CEX data.14Similar to the case
13:477:31951:19:19:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discussed above, the structural estimation of (9) and (10) requires instrumental variables and a
13:478:32047:19:16:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:selection correction for working couples.15We discuss the choice of instruments in the empirical
13:479:32143:16:19:80:539:205:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:14We impute using the CEX instead of the PSID for several reasons. First, the CEX sample is larger; second, it
13:480:32253:19:15:72:540:186:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is conducted at the same annual frequency of ATUS (while the PSID is biannual); Önally, the consumption measure
13:481:32364:15:15:72:540:171:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:in the CEX is more comprehensive than the PSID measure.  Separately for each year, we impute to each ATUS
13:482:32469:15:16:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:household the average level of CEX consumption observed for households with the same wifeís birth cohort and level
13:483:32583:16:8:72:124:140:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:of education.
13:484:32596:8:19:80:539:132:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:15The estimation of (10) also requires data on total household taxable income. While in this PSID this measure
13:485:32706:19:0:72:540:113:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:is readily available, in the ATUS only a proxy can be constructed. Given that the PSID estimates are very close

14:489:33027:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time use, etc., where the choice variables are a function of observable prices and the unobservable
14:490:33126:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal utility of wealth. First-di§erencing the data (i.e., using the Euler equation) eliminates
14:491:33224:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the unobservable marginal utility of wealth and allows unbiased estimation of intertemporal sub-
14:492:33320:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stitution parameters. A di§erent estimation strategy is to proxy the unobservable marginal utility
14:493:33418:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of wealth with consumption. In this case, one is e§ectively di§erencing across economic decisions
14:494:33515:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(given time) instead of di§erencing across time (given economic choices). Of course, one still needs
14:495:33615:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to instrument the endogenous consumption level, but this is a more conventional problem than
14:496:33707:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:modeling directly the structure of the marginal utility of wealth (which requires assumptions about
14:497:33806:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the information set, etc.). This strategy is particularly useful in contexts, like ours in the ATUS
14:498:33905:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:case, in which there is no panel data allowing to follow the dynamics of economic decisions across

14:503:34297:22:19:71:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:solve the life cycle problem given the parameters estimated in the Örst step (i.e.,'L1,'L2,-L,'T1,

14:508:34692:26:19:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Labor supply elasticities are an obvious object of interest for policy analysis and the focus of a
14:509:34790:19:19:71:539:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:vast literature (Keane, 2011).  In our context, they are complicated functions of the preference
14:510:34886:19:19:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameters described above. In this section we discuss how they can be obtained from model-based
14:511:34982:19:19:71:119:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses.
14:512:34992:19:19:86:539:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We Örst notice that elasticities for hours of work, leisure, and parental time are linked through

15:524:35460:19:18:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constant marginal utility (to get Frisch elasticities), or nothing at all (Marshall or uncompensated
15:525:35560:18:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities); or consider transitory or permanent wage changes. In practice, the mapping between
15:526:35657:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our preference parameters and these various elasticities can be obtained by simulating the response
15:527:35756:19:19:72:284:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of hours to wage changes of di§erent nature.
15:528:35800:19:19:86:539:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Two special (and policy-relevant) type of elasticities (Frisch and Marshall) obtain when the
15:529:35892:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouses are choosing interior hours solution and they face no progressive taxes and no liquidity
15:530:35988:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constraints; moreover, in this setting one can approximate the Frisch elasticity as the response to
15:531:36087:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transitory wage changes and the Marshall elasticity as the response to permanent wage changes
15:532:36180:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(see Blundell et al., 2016). In the analysis below we use our model to simulate the response of
15:533:36275:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time uses to transitory and permanent shocks - this also o§ers an alternative to the approximation
15:534:36373:19:19:72:272:480:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:approach used by Blundell et al. (2016).16
15:535:36415:19:19:86:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition underlying (11) is simple. Consider the e§ect of a temporary wage increase faced
15:536:36509:19:19:72:539:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the wife (j= 2) in a setting with interior hours solution and no credit market frictions. Since the
15:537:36611:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage change is temporary and the consumers are unconstrained, wealth e§ects are (approximately)
15:538:36706:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:zero and there are only intertemporal substitution e§ects. The e§ect of a temporary positive shock
15:539:36804:19:19:72:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the wifeís labor supply (-H2;W2j-W2=trans:-=-H2;W2j@-=0, with-being the marginal utility of
15:540:36898:19:19:71:539:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wealth) can be decomposed into two distinct forces. First, a positive temporary deviation from the
15:541:36996:19:19:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:normal wage induces workers to reallocate their work time intertemporally to periods in which the
15:542:37093:19:19:71:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage is temporarily higher and their leisure to periods with lower wages. This e§ect is captured by
15:543:37192:19:19:71:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the Örst term and its strength is measured by the leisure elasticity-L2;W2j-W2=trans:<0(leisure
15:544:37287:19:19:71:539:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:B:Lis a "good" that costsW).  When the wage is temporarily high, moreover, it becomes more
15:545:37375:19:19:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costly to devote time to children, and this induces a further increase in hours (or, more correctly, a
15:546:37477:19:19:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decline in childcare hours that is partly reallocated to work), an e§ect whose strength is measured
15:547:37576:19:19:71:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by-T2;W2j-W2=trans:<0. The two elasticities are weighted byL2H2andT2H2, respectively, because
15:548:37669:19:19:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their strength depends on "time allocation shares" (i.e., the second e§ect is absent for earners who
15:549:37769:19:19:72:468:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:devote no time to children to start with or for households with no young children).
15:550:37852:19:19:86:539:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A somewhat more interesting e§ect is how the wife responds to temporary changes in the hus-
15:551:37943:19:19:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bandís wage, (-H2;W1j-W1=trans:), i.e., the cross-responses. A temporary increase in the husbandís
15:552:38041:19:16:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage induces him to work longer hours (for reasons explained above). If husband and wife enjoy
15:553:38135:16:0:80:455:122:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:A:16Blundell, Pistaferri and Saporta-Eksten (2017) compare the two approaches more formally.
16:554:38227:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure together,-L2;W1j-W1=trans:<0and, in the absence of childcare time (T2= 0), we should
16:555:38319:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:see an increase in the wifeís hours as well. When husband and wife hours can be used to produce
16:556:38414:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare, however, the e§ect is less obvious. If their childcare hours are substitutes in production,
16:557:38516:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an increase in hours worked by the husband implies he can now allocate fewer hours to childcare
16:558:38611:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production, and hence the wife will allocate more hours to childcare production (and fewer hours
16:559:38707:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to market time, i.e., work less). This implies-T2;W1j-W1=trans:>0. The magnitude of the e§ect
16:560:38800:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:will depend on the degree of input substitutability in childcare production. It follows that the two
16:561:38900:19:35:72:255:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:forces may well counteract each other.

16:563:38962:26:19:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Besides Frisch elasticities, a complete characterization of labor supply behavior requires under-
16:564:39059:19:19:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standing how Marshallian elasticities vary across households with or without children. Without
16:565:39153:19:19:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxes, the Frisch responses coincide with the goods responses to transitory price shocks. Permanent
16:566:39252:19:19:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks, however, change the marginal utility of wealth as well. The overall response to permanent
16:567:39349:19:19:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shock to prices is captured by the Marshallian elasticities. Generally, Marshallian responses to (per-

16:596:40184:19:19:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The last term, the added work e§ect, leads to a change in wealth which in turn induces a change
16:597:40279:19:16:71:388:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in hours (and of child care time and leisure time correspondingly).
16:598:40346:16:12:80:484:186:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:A:17Blundell et. al. (2016) provide an overview of the forces present in the family labor supply model.
16:599:40447:12:19:80:539:174:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:18Adoption of a collective framework of behavior would introduce a further reason for observing a relationship
16:600:40557:19:16:72:540:155:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:between husband and wife leisure. For example, under limited commitment, negative wage shocks (especially perma-
16:601:40669:16:15:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:nent ones) faced by the husband reduce his Pareto weight, implying that the partner gains in terms of consumption
16:602:40782:15:16:72:540:124:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:of all goods, including the consumption of leisure. This e§ect runs opposite to the added worker e§ect that we Önd
16:603:40896:16:0:72:409:108:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:dominates empirically. We leave the analysis of this further channel to future work.
17:604:40982:0:19:86:539:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In the empirical application we demonstrate the di§erent roles of our parameters both in shaping
17:605:41078:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the Marshallian labor supply responses, and in shaping the Marshallian consumption response,
17:606:41170:19:42:72:376:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which is closely related to the degree of consumption insurance.
17:607:41234:42:30:72:342:628:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4  Data and Estimation Methodology
17:608:41268:30:19:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For our empirical analysis we use three datasets: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the
17:609:41364:19:19:72:540:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:American Time Use Survey (ATUS), and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). We describe
17:610:41451:19:34:72:210:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their salient features in turn.
17:611:41482:34:26:72:245:526:12:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:C:4.1The PSID Interview Data
17:612:41508:26:19:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The PSID started in 1968 collecting information on a sample of about 5,000 households.  The
17:613:41599:19:19:72:540:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:initial sample included a sub-sample that was representative of the US population (roughly 3,000
17:614:41695:19:19:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households, the "core sample") and a sub-sample of low-income households (the Census Bureauís
17:615:41788:19:19:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:"SEO sample", about 2,000 households). From then on, both the original families and their split-
17:616:41884:19:19:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:o§s (children of the original family forming a family of their own) have been followed. The PSID
17:617:41980:19:19:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interview data were collected annually until 1996 and biennially starting in 1997. Since 1999, in
17:618:42077:19:19:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:addition to income data and demographics, the PSID collects data about detailed assets holdings
17:619:42172:19:18:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and consumption expenditures. Since we need both consumption and assets data (the latter to
17:620:42263:18:19:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct instruments), we focus on interview data from the 1999-2015 sample period. These data
17:621:42358:19:19:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:therefore provide us with longitudinal information on all the variables required for estimation of
17:622:42456:19:19:72:540:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(7) and (8) with the exception of the time that each earner spends on childcare.  We focus on
17:623:42549:19:19:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households with married couples where the wife is aged 25 to 65. For the estimation of (7) and
17:624:42643:19:19:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(8) we further restrict our sample to couples with no young children (deÖned by being 10 or less).
17:625:42741:19:19:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this sample parental time is zero by assumption, and hence leisure time can be obtained as the
17:626:42838:19:19:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:di§erence between total time available and hours of work. We further focus on households with
17:627:42931:19:19:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non missing data on consumption and education of both earners. Finally, to reduce the impact of
17:628:43026:19:19:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measurement error in the estimation of (7) and (8) we drop observation where one of the earners
17:629:43121:19:19:72:504:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is working more than 60 hours a week for the entire year, implying very low leisure values.
17:630:43212:19:19:86:539:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The construction of the consumption data is similar to Blundell et al. (2016). We use only con-
17:631:43307:19:19:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sumption categories that were consistently collected starting in 1999. These include food (at home
17:632:43405:19:0:72:540:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and away), health expenditures, utilities, gasoline, car maintenance, transportation, education,
18:633:43503:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare, home insurance and rent (or rent equivalent for homeowners).19We treat sub-categories
18:634:43599:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with missing values as zeros. Finally, we winsorize log of hourly wages, leisure, consumption, non-
18:635:43698:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:labor income and the ratio in (8) at the top and bottom 1 percent to avoid outliers driving the
18:636:43793:19:35:72:106:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results.
18:637:43801:35:26:72:199:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.2  The ATUS Data
18:638:43819:26:19:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) collects information on time use for a representative sam-
18:639:43913:19:19:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ple of the US population. The sample is drawn from those who have completed their eighth and
18:640:44005:19:19:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Önal month of interviews for the Current Population Survey (CPS). One respondent per household
18:641:44099:19:19:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(either the husband or wife in couple households) reports detailed information on how he/she spent
18:642:44197:19:19:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:his/her time on the previous day. The matching with the CPS can be used to recover demographic
18:643:44291:19:19:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information for the respondent and the spouse (including his/her hourly wage), although some infor-
18:644:44390:19:19:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mation is updated at the time of the ATUS interview. In its modern format, the ATUS is available
18:645:44486:19:19:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for the 2003-15 period (older waves are also available, but di§er substantially in format and content
18:646:44587:19:19:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the more recent waves - we do not use them). The broad type of time use activities covered
18:647:44682:19:19:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the ATUS include: Personal care, Eating and drinking, Household activities, Purchasing goods
18:648:44777:19:19:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and services, Caring for and helping household members, Caring for and helping non-household
18:649:44869:19:19:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:members, Working and work-related activities, Educational activities, Organizational, civic, and
18:650:44965:19:19:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:religious activities, Leisure and sports, Telephone calls, mail, and e-mail. Our deÖnition of childcare
18:651:45068:19:19:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time includes: Caring for and helping household children (activity codes 030101-030199), Activities
18:652:45167:19:19:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:related to household childrenís education (activity codes 030201-030299), and Activities related to
18:653:45266:19:19:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household childrenís health (activity codes 030301-030399). Separately for each year, we impute
18:654:45361:19:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time of the husbands of wife respondents by computing the average childcare time of
18:655:45454:18:19:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all husband respondents (averaged over their wivesíbirth cohort and education, which are always
18:656:45549:19:19:72:121:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observed).
18:657:45559:19:19:86:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our sample selection focuses on households where the youngest child is 10 or younger. Given
18:658:45650:19:19:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that we are interested in the substitution between time spent with the children and hours of work,
18:659:45748:19:19:72:457:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we only use the weekday diaries (Monday to Friday) and drop national holidays.
18:660:45826:19:17:86:539:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We use ATUS data to estimate equations (9) and (10).  Unfortunately, the ATUS does not
18:661:45912:17:19:80:539:156:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:19In 2014, due to an error in the PSID data collection procedure, the data on car maintenance is missing whenever
18:662:46025:19:15:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:a car insurance value is reported. We impute these values using a within household projection of the car maintenance
18:663:46141:15:0:72:459:122:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:budget share on all other transportation related budget shares as well as the food budget share.
19:664:46239:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contain any information about consumption. We hence impute consumption using data from the
19:665:46329:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CEX, described next. Separately for each year, we impute to each ATUS household the average
19:666:46420:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level of consumption observed in the CEX for households with the same wifeís birth cohort and
19:667:46513:19:35:72:158:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level of education.
19:668:46532:35:26:72:192:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.3  The CEX Data
19:669:46549:26:19:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) is the only US data set that has comprehensive and
19:670:46637:19:19:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:detailed information on household expenditure and its various components. Available on a contin-
19:671:46733:19:19:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uous basis since 1980, it is used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to form weights that go
19:672:46830:19:19:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the computation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) (and for other minor matters as well). The
19:673:46925:19:19:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CEX is composed of two distinct surveys, the Interview survey (where spending information is by
19:674:47020:19:19:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:three-month recall), and the Diary survey (where spending is collected by Ölling a 2-week diary).
19:675:47117:19:19:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Respondents in the Interview survey are sampled every 3 months (for a total of 5 times, although
19:676:47213:19:19:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data for the Örst interview are not released because they are merely preparatory), while those in
19:677:47310:19:19:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the Diary survey are sampled only once. The two surveys cover di§erent consumption items, with
19:678:47404:19:19:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:some overlap. We focus on the Interview sample. We construct a measure of nondurable consump-
19:679:47497:19:19:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion deÖned as the sum of spending on food at home, food away from home, alcohol and tobacco,
19:680:47590:19:19:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:utilities, maintenance and repairs, education, housing services, Önancial services, clothing, health,
19:681:47691:19:19:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:entertainment, cash contributions, transportation, and other nondurables. We then deáate using
19:682:47785:19:19:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the CPI. Our sample excludes rural households, those with incomplete income responses, and those
19:683:47881:19:34:72:184:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with zero consumption.
19:684:47903:34:26:72:227:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.4  Descriptive Statistics
19:685:47930:26:19:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Descriptive statistics on time use from the ATUS (Panel A of Table 1) show that among households
19:686:48026:19:19:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with a child aged 10 or less, about 31% of husbands and 8% of wives report zero hours spent with
19:687:48122:19:19:72:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their kids.20Partly, this di§erence is due to the diary nature of the data. Suppose that on the day
19:688:48221:19:19:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time use data were collected the husband left early in the morning and returned after the child went
19:689:48321:19:19:72:539:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to sleep. It would be clearly misleading to assume that the husband spent zeroannualchildcare
19:690:48414:19:19:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time based on observing zero childcare hours on the diary day. Similarly, it is possible that some of
19:691:48515:19:19:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the zeros may come from the respondent being out of town on the previous day. For these reasons,
19:692:48611:19:17:72:540:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimation of moment conditions (9) and (10) uses actual wifeís childcare time. Given the way time
19:693:48709:17:0:80:528:114:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:A:20The share of husbands with positive childcare time is calculated from the sample of ATUS male respondents.
20:694:48819:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use data are collected in the ATUS, when childcare time are observed for the wife, they are missing
20:695:48918:19:19:72:371:689:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:for the husband. Hence, we impute them as described above.21
20:696:48978:19:19:86:539:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The Panel A of Table 1 also shows the distribution of annual childcare hours for husbands and
20:697:49071:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wives (with and without zeros). Among husbands, median hours are 331 and the mean is very
20:698:49160:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similar. Among wives who devote some time to their kids, median hours are 542 and the mean is
20:699:49253:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:656. Consistent with estimates from Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008) and Ramey and Ramey
20:700:49342:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2010), we thus Önd that wifeís childcare annual hours are almost twice as much as the husbandís
20:701:49438:19:19:72:101:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hours.
20:702:49444:19:19:86:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Descriptive statistics on PSID variables (consumption, leisure, hours, and hourly wages) for
20:703:49536:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the sample which is used in the estimation of (7) and (8) are reported in Panel B of Table 1. The
20:704:49633:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:survey collects data on annual labor earnings and on annual hours of work. To construct the hourly
20:705:49731:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage measure we divide annual earnings by annual hours of work. Hence, we have a measure of
20:706:49822:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the average hourly wage. As expected, men work longer hours and have higher hourly wages than
20:707:49915:19:41:72:108:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women.
20:708:49921:41:30:72:303:420:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5  IdentiÖcation and Estimation
20:709:49952:30:19:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There are three sets of parameters in the model: wage parameters, preference parameters, and tax
20:710:50048:19:19:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameters. Some of these parameters are set outside the model (either matching moments in the
20:711:50142:19:19:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data or relying on external estimate), while the rest of the parameters need to be estimated. For the
20:712:50243:19:35:72:537:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rest of this section we provide details about how each model parameter is either set or estimated.
20:713:50341:35:26:72:308:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.1  Parameters Set Outside the Model
20:714:50378:26:19:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 2 summarizes the model parameters that are set externally without solving the model or
20:715:50470:19:19:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimating Örst order conditions. First we need to set the wage process parameters. We use the
20:716:50564:19:19:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates from Blundell et al. (2016) for the parameterization of the variances and covariances of
20:717:50662:19:19:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transitory and permanent wage shocks. Blundell et al. estimate the stochastic process in (1)-(2),
20:718:50759:19:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correcting for measurement error (which is crucial for the estimation of the variance of transitory
20:719:50858:19:19:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks). We rely on their speciÖcation with age-constant variances over the life-cycle in setting
20:720:50955:19:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the variance of permanent (transitory) shocks to 0.0303 (0.0275) for husbands and 0.0382 (0.0125)
20:721:51052:16:19:80:539:142:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:21The ATUS number of observations in Table 1 include also the observations with zero childcare for the wife, and
20:722:51164:19:0:72:337:123:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:hence it is not identical to the number of observations in Table 3.
21:723:51233:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for wives. They report very small (and only marginally signiÖcant) positive covariances for the
21:724:51328:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks between earners within the family. Unlike them, who only require estimates of the variance
21:725:51425:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of income shocks, a full solution of our model also requires a characterization of the deterministic
21:726:51525:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:component of the life-cycle proÖle of wages, as well as specifying the variance of the initial draw of
21:727:51627:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the permanent component of wages. We assume that husband and wife enter the labor market at
21:728:51718:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:25 and that they retire at age 65. We approximate the life-cycle proÖle of wages using a constant
21:729:51815:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and a quadratic polynomial in age. To avoid confounding cohort and age e§ects, we also control
21:730:51909:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for cohort dummies (in 5 birth year categories). Finally, we include controls for education levels.
21:731:52008:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We use the coe¢ cients from these regressions to generate the average age proÖle of wages over the
21:732:52106:19:19:72:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:life-cycle in the model, separately for husbands and wives.22To estimate the variance at the time
21:733:52203:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of entry in the labor market, we use the variance of the regression residuals for husbands and wives
21:734:52303:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:aged 25 to 30. The actual estimates are reported in Table 2. Both age proÖles are concave - and
21:735:52398:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:due perhaps to the incidence of early retirement, the male-female wage di§erential declines after
21:736:52495:19:19:72:392:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:age 50. There is more initial wage dispersion for women than men.
21:737:52560:19:19:86:539:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To discipline the initial assets distribution, we use the distribution of net worth (including
21:738:52654:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:housing) in the PSID for families where the wife is 25 to 30 years old. In the data, about 23%
21:739:52748:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of households start with zero or negative assets. We assume that there is a similar share of zero
21:740:52845:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assets households in the model. For the non-zero assets households, we approximate the initial
21:741:52939:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of assets with a log-normal distribution, taking the variance of this distribution from
21:742:53039:19:19:72:120:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the PSID.
21:743:53048:19:19:86:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We follow Blundell et al. (2016) when setting the scale and exponent parameters of the tax
21:744:53138:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:function (5).  However, we extend their work in two directions.  First, we allow for a taxable
21:745:53232:19:19:72:539:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income áoor (b(z)in equation (5)) of $1,000 per month for families with kids (bk) and of $367 for
21:746:53329:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:families without kids (bnk), which is consistent with the TANF and food stamps (SNAP) average
21:747:53422:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allowances for households with no earnings (as of 2010). Second, when the wife is employed, we
21:748:53516:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:impose a Öxed cost of work - equivalent to a áat tax conditional on employment. For families with
21:749:53613:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kids, this Öxed cost equals the average childcare cost faced by families with young kids and an
21:750:53708:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employed wife aged 30 to 35, which we estimate to be around $2,900 (using PSID data on childcare
21:751:53804:19:19:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spending). For families without kids, we estimate the Öxed cost parameter structurally to match
21:752:53899:19:17:72:343:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wivesíparticipation in the data (see more details in 5.3).
21:753:53957:17:19:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:22The coe¢ cients from these regressions are reported asd0;wj; d1;wj; d2;wjin Table 2. To match the mean of log
21:754:54068:19:0:72:393:122:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:wages over the life-cycle, we restrict the sum of the cohort e§ects to equal zero.
22:755:54152:0:19:86:539:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we simplify family composition in the model by assuming that families either have a
22:756:54244:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:young child or not.  Childbirth occurs when the wife is 28, and the child remains "young" for
22:757:54337:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the next 10 years.23The last two parameters that we set externally are the interest rate and
22:758:54429:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the discount rate - the actual value chosen are in the last two rows of Table 2, and are relatively
22:759:54528:19:35:72:147:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:uncontroversial.
22:760:54544:35:26:72:366:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.2  Parameters Estimated using MRS Equations
22:761:54589:26:19:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As explained above, we break estimation of preference parameters into two steps. In the Örst step we
22:762:54689:19:19:72:539:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:identify the parameters-,'L1,'L2,-L,'T1,'T2, and-Tusing Örst order conditions (the marginal
22:763:54780:19:19:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate of substitution between husband and wife leisure (7), the marginal rate of substitution between
22:764:54880:19:19:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the wifeís leisure and household consumption (8), the marginal rate of substitution between husband
22:765:54979:19:19:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and wife childcare time (9), and the marginal rate of substitution between the wifeís childcare time
22:766:55079:19:19:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and household consumption (10)). In the second step (detailed in the next sub-section) we estimate
22:767:55177:19:19:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the remaining parameters (preference shifters) using estimation by simulation - in particular, we
22:768:55274:19:19:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:minimize the distance between moments in the data and identical moments simulated in our life

22:770:55462:19:19:72:358:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that can be identiÖed from estimation of equations (7)-(10).

22:772:55613:19:19:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:older than 10 and impose theoretical restrictions across the two equations. Estimation of moment

22:774:55800:19:19:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and also impose theoretical restrictions across the two equations except for-(the consumption

22:776:55991:19:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:both cases, we assume interior solutions and hence focus on samples of working couples (adding
22:777:56085:18:19:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Heckman correction terms to account for sample selectivity). Note that we do not need to impose
22:778:56180:19:19:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:such selection when estimating preference shifters nor do we need them when evaluating overall

22:784:56705:19:9:72:244:137:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:that none of our conclusions were a§ected.
22:785:56747:9:12:80:395:128:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:A:24We do so because in ATUS we have only an imputed consumption measure.
22:786:56818:12:0:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:25In the theoretical model wages are exogenous. But the possibility of measurement error implies that they should

23:793:57523:19:19:86:539:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to the identiÖcation of equations (9) and (10), we have similar endogeneity problems
23:794:57615:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and use again a set of instruments for the endogenous variables childcare time, consumption and
23:795:57710:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wages. However, since the ATUS sample is much smaller and we do not have information on assets
23:796:57804:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as in the PSID, we use a smaller instrument set, which excludes unearned income, the liquidity

23:799:58090:19:35:72:490:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that adds the husbandís actual years of schooling as an additional exclusion restriction.

23:801:58224:26:19:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Önal set of parameters to estimate includes the preference shifters, the Öxed costs of female
23:802:58321:19:19:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employment for families without children (since we set externally the Öxed costs of female employ-
23:803:58419:19:19:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ment for families with children), and the equivalence scale for consumption. As explained above,
23:804:58515:19:19:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the model we allow families to either have a young child or not. This implies that we need to
23:805:58611:19:19:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the mean of the leisure preference shifter for families with kids (-kL1; -kL2) and without
23:806:58710:19:19:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them (-nkL1; -nkL2). Moreover, for families with kids we also need to estimate the mean of parental
23:807:58809:19:19:72:539:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:time preference shifters (-kT1; -kT2). This is of course not relevant for families without kids since
23:808:58910:19:18:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by construction their utility function does not include the parental time sub-aggregate. We al-

23:811:59195:19:21:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are the preference shifters for consumption-C. Given that the level of utility is arbitrary, we can
23:812:59294:21:8:72:156:209:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:be instrumented too.
23:813:59314:8:19:80:539:201:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:26We assume that these variables shift wages, time use decisions, and consumption choices, but are orthogonal to
23:814:59426:19:16:72:540:182:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:preference shocks or measurement error. While these may be strong assumptions, our datasets do not o§er quasi-
23:815:59536:16:15:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:experimental variation. When we discuss the results, we show that the results are qualitatively similar if we apply a
23:816:59653:15:8:72:280:151:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:dynamic panel instruments approach to PSID data.
23:817:59701:8:20:80:539:143:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:27Unobserved heterogeneity is assumed to be Öxed over time. We approximate it with a discrete two state distrib-
23:818:59813:20:0:72:457:123:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:ution, implying that each family draw either a high or a low value for wifeís leisure preferences.
24:819:59913:0:19:72:539:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:normalize one parameter. In particular, we set the-nkC= 1for families without kids. We then
24:820:60004:19:19:72:374:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the level of this shifter for families with children (-kC).
24:821:60072:19:19:86:539:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Overall this leaves us with 10 parameters to estimate: preference shifts in husband and wife
24:822:60164:19:19:71:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure as a function of having or not young kids (-kL1; -nkL1; -kL2; -nkL2), parental time preference
24:823:60266:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shifters (-kT1; -kT2), unobserved heterogeneity in female preferences for leisure, separately by family
24:824:60369:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:type (-2;k"L2; -2;nk"L2), the Öxed cost of female employment for families with no young kids (\rnk), and
24:825:60473:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the preference shifter for consumption for families with young kids-kC. We choose eleven moments
24:826:60569:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the data that should be informative about these parameters: male and female hours of work for
24:827:60665:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:families with and without young children, male and female parental time hours when young kids
24:828:60758:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are present, the interquartile range of hours and the employment rates of women with and without
24:829:60854:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:young kids, and the change in household consumption when a child is born. We calculate these
24:830:60946:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moments when the wife is aged 30-35. To separately match the moments for families with and
24:831:61036:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:without kids at these ages, we solve and simulate the model twice ñonce for families with young
24:832:61131:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kids, and once for families without. While there is no one-to-one match between the structural
24:833:61225:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:parameters and the targeted moments, some parameters are naturally linked to some of the chosen
24:834:61320:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moments.  For example, cross-sectional variation in hours (captured by the interquartile range)
24:835:61415:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:should be informative about the variance of unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for leisure;
24:836:61511:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similarly, the arrival of a child leads to reallocation in consumption across periods that should be
24:837:61611:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reáected in economies of scale; the levels of hours should be informative about preference shifters
24:838:61710:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in leisure, while the level of time devoted to kids should help pinning down preference shifters for
24:839:61810:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time among households with young kids. Finally, employment rates of women with kids
24:840:61903:19:19:72:517:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(and how they di§er from those of women without kids) should reáect the Öxed cost of work.
24:841:61993:19:19:86:539:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our two-step estimation approach delivers consistent estimates of the parameters of interest
24:842:62085:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:under standard regularity conditions. However, the standard errors of the SMM estimates need
24:843:62177:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to be corrected for the use of Örst-stage estimates. Following Gourinchas and Parker (2002), we
24:844:62272:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:use the gradient of the second stage objective, along with the Örst stage variances, to correct the
24:845:62371:19:0:72:332:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:second stage covariance matrix of the SMM estimates.

25:850:62652:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at least two weeks of annual work); they also include an inverse Mills ratio to correct for selection.
25:851:62754:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:PSID standard errors are clustered at the household level due to the longitudinal nature of the
25:852:62849:19:19:72:416:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dataset (this is not needed in the ATUS since it is a pure cross-section).
25:853:62923:19:18:86:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The Örst thing to note is that the estimated consumption Frisch elasticity-is within a plausible
25:854:63019:18:19:72:539:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:range. The estimate is-= 0:903with a tight standard error of 0.049 - very much in the ballpark of
25:855:63116:19:19:72:539:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:typical literature estimates. Turning to time use parameters, the estimate of-Tis negative (-0.197
25:856:63214:19:19:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with a standard error of 0.123), implying that, plausibly, husbandís and wifeís childcare time are
25:857:63312:19:19:72:540:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substitutes in the home production function for child services. We also Önd sizable estimates of the
25:858:63412:19:19:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:utility parameters'T1and'T2, which are strictly related to the responsiveness of childcare time
25:859:63507:19:19:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to wage changes. The estimate of'T2, in particular, implies a relatively large responsiveness of the
25:860:63607:19:19:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wife on the childcare time margin. While this may appear surprising at Örst, note that our sample
25:861:63704:19:19:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:includes both mothers of pre-school children, as well as mothers of older children (aged between 5
25:862:63802:19:19:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and 10), where there is much more áexibility in shifting time allocated to childcare (and also "more
25:863:63902:19:19:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:room to go" given constraints on work schedules higher up in the distribution of hours). Finally, on
25:864:64002:19:19:72:539:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the leisure time front, the estimate of-Lis positive and signiÖcant, implying complementarity of
25:865:64098:19:19:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure time (partners enjoy spending their leisure together). As for leisure responsiveness estimates
25:866:64200:19:19:72:460:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:('L1and'L2), they are quite small and not dramatically di§erent across gender.
25:867:64278:19:19:86:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Appendix Table 1 reports the estimates for the leisure and consumption elasticities obtained
25:868:64370:19:19:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using di§erent estimation approaches. In particular, rather than using education, cohort and un-
25:869:64466:19:19:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:earned income as instruments, we apply a dynamic panel instruments approach, instrumenting the
25:870:64560:19:19:72:540:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous variables with lagged wages, as well as lagged log-di§erence of leisure of both earners
25:871:64658:19:19:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and of consumption. While the sample is much smaller (due to the dynamic instruments and the
25:872:64750:19:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:small number of waves), the estimates are qualitatively very similar to the ones reported in Panel
25:873:64848:19:19:72:135:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A of Table 3.

25:875:64951:19:14:72:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:via simulation of the structural model.28We match moments for families with and without kids
25:876:65043:14:0:80:539:125:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:28Standard errors are calculated applying a correction for two step estimation similar to Gourinchas and Parker
26:877:65156:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:when the wife is 30-35 (using PSID data). While the magnitudes are not directly interpretable,
26:878:65250:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there are a few points that are worth noting. First, given the MRS estimates and the Öxed cost
26:879:65344:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of employment for the case with children (which is not estimated but set equal to the average
26:880:65437:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:child care costs observed in the data), the estimation implies smaller variance for the wifeís leisure
26:881:65539:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preference shifters for families without young children. Second, turning to Öxed costs of work, for
26:882:65638:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:women with children Öxed cost of work is parametrized to match childcare cost ($2,900, see Table
26:883:65734:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2), on top of the childcare time cost. The estimated Öxed cost of work for families without children
26:884:65834:19:19:72:486:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is about $4,800, quite close to the parameterized value of families with young children.
26:885:65922:19:19:86:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:How good is the Öt of the model? Table 4 shows the data moments along with the simulated
26:886:66010:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moments (i.e., the internal Öt of the model). Panel A includes the targeted moments (when the
26:887:66103:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wifeís age is 30 to 35). We estimate 10 parameters targeting 11 moments, and hence we have an
26:888:66196:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over-identiÖed case where the data moments are not matched mechanically. Nevertheless, for all
26:889:66290:19:19:72:272:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:moments the model does an excellent job.
26:890:66330:19:19:86:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Because we keep all parameters constant over the life cycle conditional on family composition, a
26:891:66426:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tough test of the model consists of evaluating the match of moments at later stages of the life cycle
26:892:66527:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(which we do not target explicitly). Panel B shows the key labor supply moments when the wife
26:893:66620:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is 50-55 (while, to reiterate, the moments we target in Panel A refer to women aged 30-35). The
26:894:66715:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:match is qualitatively good. Both in the data and in the model, labor supply of husbands is much
26:895:66811:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lower compared to the case of men with and without children married to younger women (a 200-300
26:896:66906:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:annual hours di§erence). For wives, labor supply is higher relative to younger women with kids
26:897:67000:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and lower relative to younger women without kids (and the opposite for the dispersion of hours).
26:898:67096:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:All labor supply magnitudes at later stages of the life cycle are somewhat higher in the model than
26:899:67195:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the data. Some of the level di§erence are likely attributable to the fact that we ignore changes
26:900:67294:19:34:72:535:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in cohort and education composition when calculating the moments at di§erent ages in the data.
26:901:67388:34:26:72:205:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  Model Responses
26:902:67408:26:19:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The most relevant use of the structural model is that we can now use our estimates to simulate
26:903:67502:19:19:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the response of consumption and time use to transitory and permanent wage shocks over the life
26:904:67596:19:19:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cycle. As explained above, response to transitory and permanent shocks will also approximately
26:905:67690:19:19:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:coincide with, respectively, policy-relevant Frisch and Marshallian elasticities under some special
26:906:67789:19:21:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:circumstances (interior hours solution, no progressive taxation, and no borrowing constraints). The

27:908:67897:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:literature that has focused on exercises of this type typically neglects family labor supply and ignores
27:909:68001:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allocation of time use when children are present. In our context, a key dimension of heterogeneity
27:910:68099:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the elasticities is indeed the presence and age of children. For this reason, we separately report
27:911:68200:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses for households with and without young children (aged 10 or less). We obtain the two
27:912:68293:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:types of responses by solving and simulating the model twice. First, under the assumption that
27:913:68387:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there are young children in the households and second, under the assumptions that there are no
27:914:68481:19:19:72:113:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children.
27:915:68490:19:19:86:539:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We focus on consumption and time use responses at age 30, when all households in our simulated
27:916:68584:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data have a young child (recall that the assumption is that childbirth occurs when the woman is
27:917:68679:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:28). Our exercise consists of simulating the impact of a 10% shock to a given earnerís wage. We
27:918:68774:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consider transitory and permanent shocks, and look at the impact of shocks received by husband
27:919:68868:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and wife separately. Table 5 reports the consumption and time use responses (hours of work on
27:920:68961:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the intensive and extensive margin, leisure, and time devoted to children) corresponding to the
27:921:69056:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:various cases. Temporary shocks can be interpreted as one-time changes in the tax code (e.g. a
27:922:69150:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:temporary increase/reduction in the payroll tax rate), while permanent shocks are more likely to
27:923:69246:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reáect structural tax reforms. Table 5 reports response elasticities "on impact" (we comment below
27:924:69344:19:19:72:192:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on longer run responses).
27:925:69369:19:19:86:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Starting with consumption, we obtain the traditional result that consumption responds much
27:926:69459:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more to permanent shocks than transitory shocks. The response to male permanent shocks is larger
27:927:69555:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than to female permanent shocks due to the larger role played by men on family earnings. The
27:928:69647:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non-zero response to transitory shock is due to non-separability through female employment and
27:929:69741:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the presence of (for some households) binding liquidity constraints (which we study more in detail
27:930:69839:19:19:72:107:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:below).
27:931:69846:19:19:86:539:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Consider now the e§ect of a positive transitory shock to the womanís wage - a wage change that
27:932:69940:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:has mostly substitution e§ects and very modest wealth e§ects. A woman without kids increases
27:933:70032:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:her hours of work and reduces time devoted to leisure - the hours elasticity is 0.39 (column 6). The
27:934:70132:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:impact of the same change on the labor supply of a women with kids is larger (an elasticity of 0.7)
27:935:70231:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because she has another margin of adjustment, childcare time (column 5). For men (columns 3,
27:936:70323:19:19:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:4), the response to own transitory shocks in the two cases (with and without children) are similar
27:937:70421:19:19:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because menís childcare time is small to begin with and because of their lower preferences for
27:938:70515:19:19:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spending time with the kids. This conÖrms the typical result in the literature of larger elasticity
27:939:70614:19:0:72:540:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for women than men, but highlights a component of heterogeneity (time use in the presence of
28:940:70708:0:19:72:218:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children) that is often ignored.
28:941:70740:19:19:86:539:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The hours cross-responses are also interesting. When the husbandís wage increases temporarily,
28:942:70834:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:so that he works longer hours - wives in households without kids respond very little. This reáects
28:943:70932:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pure leisure non-separability - spouses enjoy spending non-working time together, along with small
28:944:71030:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wealth e§ects of the transitory shock, giving rise together to virtually no response of leisure or hours.
28:945:71135:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:However, hours are reduced (-0.08) in households with kids because wives now have to confront
28:946:71228:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the decline in child care time of the husband, for which her childcare hours are substitutes. While
28:947:71327:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these e§ects are small, they are consistent with the idea that the presence of young children can
28:948:71424:19:19:72:239:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a§ect cross labor supply responses.
28:949:71459:19:19:86:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our model allows us also to recover the elasticities of each earnerís time use with respect to
28:950:71553:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:permanent shifts in wages. For both husband and wife the own-elasticities with respect to temporary
28:951:71652:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage changes are larger than the elasticity with respect to long run wage changes (independently of
28:952:71751:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children presence), implying a small to moderate wealth e§ect. The fact that the own permanent
28:953:71845:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage elasticities are positive implies that the substitution e§ect dominates.  Hence, permanent
28:954:71940:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decline in wages induce declines in labor supply for both partners (albeit larger for women, a
28:955:72034:19:19:72:303:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:traditional result in the labor supply literature).
28:956:72085:19:19:86:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Also of interest is the fact that the cross Marshallian elasticities are much larger for women than
28:957:72184:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for men. An important observation about these results is the size of these e§ects for households
28:958:72280:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with and without young children. While for men there is little di§erence in the elasticities, the
28:959:72377:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses are much larger in absolute value for women with young kids than for those without.
28:960:72470:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For women in couples without young kids, a permanent decline in the husbandís wage means he
28:961:72561:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:works less and earns less. She works more due to an added worker e§ect. In couples with children,
28:962:72658:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:husbands who work less allocate some of their leisure time to children, implying that the woman
28:963:72753:19:19:72:465:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can work more due to substitutability e§ects in home production of child services.
28:964:72835:19:19:86:539:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In the last four columns of Table 5 we decompose hours elasticities into extensive and intensive
28:965:72931:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:margin e§ects. The reason why this is a useful exercise is that while young men display very high
28:966:73028:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employment rates, employment rates for young women with children are much lower. This suggests
28:967:73122:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that when analyzing the response of total hours of work to shocks, extensive margin responses are
28:968:73219:19:19:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potentially important. In columns 7-8 of Table 5 we report extensive margin responses, while in
28:969:73314:19:19:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:columns 9-10 we report intensive margin responses, conditioning on the wife being employed in
28:970:73407:19:17:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:both scenarios (i.e., with and without the shock).29We Önd that both extensive and intensive
28:971:73499:17:0:80:539:122:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:29The intensive and extensive margin elasticities, as we deÖne them, need not sum up to the total hours elasticity.
29:972:73616:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:margin responses are important, although extensive margin responses appear somewhat larger in
29:973:73709:19:19:72:126:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:most cases.
29:974:73720:19:19:86:539:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:So far we have focused on the responses upon impact of the shock. While for transitory shocks
29:975:73813:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses have no long run e§ects by design, for permanent shocks this is not the case. In fact,
29:976:73909:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for permanent shocks the "on impact" and "long run" responses coincide in the case of stationary
29:977:74005:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preferences, but not when preferences depend on the presence of kids - as in our context. Figures 1
29:978:74104:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and 2 show the impulse responses to a 10% negative permanent shock to the husbandís and wifeís
29:979:74198:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wages, respectively. We assume that the shock hits at age 30 (the blue, dashed line is drawn to
29:980:74293:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the left of the shock). The four plots show the impulse responses of consumption, labor supply,
29:981:74388:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure and time devoted to kids. Younger children are present in the household only to the left of
29:982:74487:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the red, solid line. The changes in the variables of interest at age 30 reproduce the "on impact"
29:983:74584:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities reported in Tables 5 and 6. As is clear from these Ögures, the long run labor supply
29:984:74681:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:responses to the permanent shocks are attenuated when children no longer require parental time,
29:985:74776:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with the Önding of smaller elasticities for the case without young children reported in
29:986:74874:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 5. An important implication of these Öndings is that life-cycle labor supply elasticities can be
29:987:74976:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dramatically di§erent than short-term labor supply elasticities and either overstate or understate
29:988:75074:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them depending on the presence of young children in the household - a Önding consistent with the

29:1001:75507:19:19:86:539:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 reports labor supply responses (the left-hand side of (12)), while Table 6 decomposes
29:1002:75600:19:19:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these responses into leisure and childcare time responses, separately for households with and without
29:1003:75701:19:20:72:145:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:young children.
29:1004:75716:20:15:72:540:165:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:This is because the total hours elasticity includes another component, the choice of how many hours to work when
29:1005:75828:15:15:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:employment changes due to the impact of the shock. For example, if the shock implies an increase in employment,
29:1006:75939:15:16:72:540:135:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:it is typically the case that newly employed workers tend to work fewer hours on average than those employed both
29:1007:76052:16:0:72:348:119:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:before and after the shock (pushing down the total hours elasticity).
30:1008:76123:0:19:86:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:From Table 5, husbands have low transitory wage elasticities (-H1;W1j-W1=transis between 0.18
30:1009:76216:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and 0.22) which are essentially independent of the presence of children. For households with no
30:1010:76311:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kids, husbandís leisure-to-hours of work ratio is close to 1, and hence leisure elasticity is about the
30:1011:76414:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same as the negative of the hours elasticity. For households with children, the dominant force is
30:1012:76511:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure, as husbandís Frisch elasticity for childcare time is small and the childcare time-to-hours
30:1013:76610:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of work ratio is small to begin with. In any case, his reduction in childcare time is compensated
30:1014:76707:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by an increase in childcare time of his wife. In contrast, labor supply elasticities in response to
30:1015:76806:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transitory shocks for women when young children are present are much larger (0.7). Here, however,
30:1016:76903:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time responses are a dominant force - she reduces both her leisure and her time with
30:1017:76997:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kids. He consumes less leisure (because of leisure complementarity) and devote more time to kids
30:1018:77093:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(because of substitutability). Her response to transitory shocks to his wages reáects the exact same
30:1019:77193:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mechanisms, only ampliÖed. When he receives a positive transitory wage shock, she consumes less
30:1020:77288:19:19:72:463:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure (complementarity again), and more childcare time (substitutability again).
30:1021:77370:19:19:86:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:An increase in the husbandís permanent wage increases his hours and reduces both leisure and
30:1022:77462:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time - the wife steps up by spending less time working in the market and more time
30:1023:77554:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:working at home (with children). In contrast, if her permanent wage increases, he reduces hours,
30:1024:77650:19:19:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increases leisure and (only by a small amount) childcare time, while her childcare time declines
30:1025:77746:19:19:72:506:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:considerably. Hence, total time allocated to child services production declines signiÖcantly.
30:1026:77839:19:19:86:539:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The lower two plots in Figures 1 and 2 show that the increase in labor supply in response to
30:1027:77931:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:permanent negative shocks when the children no longer require parental time is driven by the latter.
30:1028:78031:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For example in Figure 2, even though wifeís leisure response is more positive after the children is
30:1029:78130:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no longer in need of care (to the right of the red, solid line), total hours response is less negative,
30:1030:78233:19:34:72:516:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:due to the fact that most of the hours response was driven by the response of childcare time.
30:1031:78326:34:26:72:243:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.4  Consumption Insurance
30:1032:78352:26:19:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In Blundell et al. (2016) the focus is to understand the e§ect of permanent wage shocks on the
30:1033:78446:19:19:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:householdís ability to smooth consumption through family labor supply, the tax/transfer system,
30:1034:78541:19:19:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and savings. In our model, the labor supply response of the partners depends on three margins:
30:1035:78635:19:19:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisure complementarity, specialization in childcare production, and wealth (added worker) e§ect.
30:1036:78732:19:19:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We illustrate these channels by decomposing the average response to a permanent shock faced
30:1037:78823:19:19:72:540:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by the primary earner (the male - who earns on average about 66% of household pre-tax labor
30:1038:78914:19:0:72:166:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:earnings) at age 30.
31:1039:78936:0:19:86:539:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:From Table 7, a 10% permanent decline in the maleís hourly wage results in a 3.9% decline
31:1040:79025:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in consumption.  Savings and taxes attenuate the response of consumption relative to after-tax
31:1041:79119:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household earnings (a 5% decline) and relative to before-tax household earnings (a 5.6% decline),
31:1042:79216:19:19:72:137:651:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:respectively.30
31:1043:79231:19:19:86:539:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In the rest of Table 7 we decompose the earnings response of the husband (a -10.7% decline in
31:1044:79324:19:19:71:539:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:before-tax earnings) and the earnings response of the wife (a 2.0% rise in before-tax earnings) into
31:1045:79424:19:19:71:202:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the three time use margins.
31:1046:79451:19:19:86:539:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:On the husbandís side, hours decline 1.0% (as the substitution e§ect dominates the wealth e§ect
31:1047:79546:19:19:71:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of a permanent decline in wages), while leisure and childcare time increase by about 1.3% and 0.7%
31:1048:79644:19:19:71:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:respectively. On the wifeís side, while total pre-tax earnings increase is 2%, the total hours increase
31:1049:79747:19:19:71:539:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is 3%. This discrepancy, absent changes in her wages, may seem puzzling at Örst. The issue is that
31:1050:79845:19:19:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this is an aggregate response. If assortative mating in wages relatively small (as it is in the data),
31:1051:79947:19:19:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:low-wage women need to work more to make up for a similar decline (in levels) in the husbandís
31:1052:80041:19:19:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:earnings. This induces a post-shock decline in the cross-sectional hour-wage covariance which, in
31:1053:80138:19:19:71:409:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:turn, generates a smaller aggregate response in earnings than in hours.
31:1054:80209:19:19:86:539:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Looking at female time use responses, the bulk of the adjustment in hours is at the expense of
31:1055:80303:19:19:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:childcare time (a 2.6% decline, over three times larger than the decline in leisure hours). A natural
31:1056:80404:19:19:71:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:next step would be to study the implications for children outcomes of such shock - do childrenís
31:1057:80500:19:19:71:539:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:test score or other indicators of school performance decline when the mother is pushed into work
31:1058:80596:19:19:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by shocks faced by the primary earner? The CDS, a module available in the PSID for some years,
31:1059:80690:19:34:71:504:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contains information on such outcomes and it is a natural source for questions of this sort.
31:1060:80782:34:26:71:232:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.5  Borrowing constraints
31:1061:80808:26:19:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In our model, households are subject to an exogenous borrowing constraint, requiring assets to be
31:1062:80905:19:19:71:539:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non-negative in each period. We discuss two questions here. First, are there dramatic di§erences
31:1063:81001:19:19:71:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of behavior between households for whom the constraint is binding and those for whom it is not?
31:1064:81096:19:19:71:478:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Second, are there alternative ways of modeling borrowing restrictions in our context?
31:1065:81181:19:19:86:539:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To evaluate the sensitivity to liquidity constraints in our model, we use model simulations to
31:1066:81275:19:19:71:539:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:study the extent of response heterogeneity in two groups of households (both with young children):
31:1067:81373:19:17:71:539:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:those in the bottom quintile of the wealth distribution (and hence more likely to experience binding
31:1068:81473:17:19:80:539:137:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:30Note that the overall consumption response is somewhat larger than the one estimated in Blundell et al. (2016).
31:1069:81586:19:0:72:500:118:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:This is not surprising given that we are focusing on young households in the early stage of their life-cycle.
32:1070:81697:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity constraints) and those in the top quintile (and hence much less likely to be subject to
32:1071:81794:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constraints). We report consumption, labor supply and time use goods responses to transitory and
32:1072:81890:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:permanent shocks in Tables 8 and 9 (comparable to Tables 5 and 6, which instead refer to the whole
32:1073:81988:19:19:72:539:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sample). All responses are measured at age 30.31As expected, consumption response to transitory
32:1074:82083:19:19:71:539:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks is much larger for the low assets households, with very small responses for high assets
32:1075:82177:19:19:71:539:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households. Consumption response to permanent shocks is slightly larger for low assets households
32:1076:82274:19:19:71:539:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as well, but given that assets are not key in insuring against permanent shocks, the di§erences are
32:1077:82373:19:19:71:539:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:much smaller compared to transitory shocks. For time use and labor supply responses to transitory
32:1078:82470:19:19:71:539:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks the wealth e§ect kicks in stronger in o§setting the typical substitution e§ect. The time use
32:1079:82569:19:19:71:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and labor supply responses to transitory shocks of the liquidity constrained households therefore
32:1080:82666:19:19:71:539:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tend to be similar to their responses to permanent shocks. For example, when a household with
32:1081:82759:19:19:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:young kids is hit by a positive transitory shocks to the husbandís wage, complementarity between
32:1082:82855:19:19:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:leisures of the two earners implies a decline of leisure for the wife, and substitution of time use
32:1083:82954:19:19:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with kids implies an increase in her time with kids. However, the wealth e§ect associated with the
32:1084:83052:19:19:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:transitory shock implies that low assets wives now want to increase their leisure, as well as increase
32:1085:83154:19:19:71:539:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:even further their childcare time. The overall impact is a reduction in wifeís labor supply which is
32:1086:83254:19:19:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stronger than what we see on average, and is in contrast with the positive labor supply response
32:1087:83350:19:19:71:216:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for the high assets households.
32:1088:83381:19:19:86:539:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:While our assumption of an exogenous borrowing constraint is a frequent characterization of
32:1089:83472:19:19:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:borrowing limits in life cycle models of consumption and labor supply, it is not uncontroversial.
32:1090:83569:19:19:71:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Several papers consider instead "natural borrowing constraints"‡ laAiyagari (1994), in which
32:1091:83661:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(due to an Inada condition on preferences) households never choose to have a level of assets that
32:1092:83758:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:could induce, with positive probability, a future state of the world in which consumption is exactly
32:1093:83858:19:19:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:zero. In this sense, the borrowing limit is the maximum amount that an individual can repay with
32:1094:83954:19:19:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:certainty. As shown by Hai and Heckman (2017), this notion of "natural borrowing constraint"
32:1095:84046:19:19:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:needs rethinking in a context with endogenous labor supply or human capital investments, since
32:1096:84140:19:18:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lenders cannot force individuals to work or to invest in human capital to repay their debt. As a
32:1097:84236:18:19:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consequence, the borrowing limits imposed by lenders must take into account the incentive com-
32:1098:84330:19:19:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patibility constraints of the borrowers. While these are important theoretically-based versions of
32:1099:84428:19:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:borrowing limits, endogenizing the nature of liquidity constraints is beyond the scope of our paper.
32:1100:84528:16:20:80:539:142:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:31Splitting the sample on the basis of assets early on in the life cycle is better than doing it at a later stage, since
32:1101:84648:20:0:72:487:122:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:the distribution of initial period assets (at age 25) is a random draw from a realistic asset distribution.

33:1104:84887:19:19:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ours but make two key simpliÖcations. In Blundell et al. (2008) there is no hours margin and no
33:1105:84982:19:19:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:secondary earner. In Blundell et al. (2016) there is no time use choice and hence no childcare
33:1106:85076:19:19:72:540:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:services to produce. Both papers obtain analytical expressions for the response of consumption
33:1107:85170:19:19:72:540:606:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(and hours) to income and wage shocks by considering approximations of the Örst order conditions
33:1108:85266:19:19:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the problem and approximations of the lifetime budget constraint. An important limitation of
33:1109:85361:19:19:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approximation-based approaches is that they cannot handle corner solutions in hours or assets.
33:1110:85455:19:19:72:540:549:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, the procedure generates approximation errors that are complex to characterize and
33:1111:85546:19:19:72:167:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:di¢ cult to quantify.
33:1112:85567:19:19:86:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Kaplan and Violante (2010) implicitly evaluate the importance of these approximation errors, in
33:1113:85662:19:19:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a model similar to Blundell et al. (2008), by comparing moments obtained from the approximation-
33:1114:85758:19:19:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:based solution (i.e., the estimation of partial insurance coe¢ cients, which use covariance terms for
33:1115:85859:19:19:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and income dynamics) against the same moments obtained from simulating the actual
33:1116:85952:19:19:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:life cycle model (where no errors are present). They show that the discrepancies are quite small,
33:1117:86049:19:19:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and are only important for the estimation of the partial insurance coe¢ cient for permanent shocks
33:1118:86147:19:19:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in a scenario with exogenously imposed liquidity constraints (but not when liquidity constrained
33:1119:86243:19:19:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are of the "natural", Ayiagari-type), and only early on in the life cycle. This shows the importance
33:1120:86343:19:19:72:207:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of corner solutions in assets.
33:1121:86373:19:19:86:539:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In a companion paper (Blundell et al., 2017), we consider the approximation error bias in the
33:1122:86466:19:19:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more general case with two earners and endogenous labor supply, similar to the setting considered
33:1123:86563:19:19:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by Blundell et al. (2016). This allows us to consider the role of corner solutions in hours. We
33:1124:86658:19:19:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of approximation-based estimators
33:1125:86751:19:19:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on these simulated data.  We show that for most Frisch elasticities the bias is small, and that
33:1126:86846:19:19:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity constraint have relatively small e§ects on the parameter estimates. We further evaluate the
33:1127:86947:19:19:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sensitivity of the bias to the choice of functional form, and the possibility of using approximations to
33:1128:87051:19:19:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:guide the choice of moments for indirect inference in a formal structural estimation setting. While
33:1129:87150:19:18:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these Monte Carlo exercises do not explicitly take into account time use, in a previous version
33:1130:87245:18:19:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of our paper (Blundell et al., 2015) we extended the approximation-based estimation strategy and
33:1131:87341:19:19:72:540:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimated Frisch elasticities for the model with time use (applying somewhat di§erent identiÖcation
33:1132:87440:19:0:72:508:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:approach and data). Reassuringly, the results were broadly similar to those we report here.
34:1133:87533:0:30:72:344:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7  Counterfactual Policy Experiments
34:1134:87569:30:19:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we discuss the results of two policy experiments. In the Örst experiment we provide
34:1135:87668:19:19:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:households with young children with an unconditional subsidy. This is achieved by changing the
34:1136:87762:19:38:72:291:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:value of the functionb(z)in the tax function:

34:1138:87845:44:19:86:539:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In the second experiment we provide households with young children with some compensation
34:1139:87934:19:19:72:539:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:B:for child-related Öxed costs of work. This is achieved by changing the value of the parameter\r(z)
34:1140:88032:19:35:72:251:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the adjusted consumption valueeC:

34:1142:88080:11:18:306:328:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f6:C:a(z)
34:1143:88084:18:19:86:539:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To make the two policies comparable (in a revenue-neutral sense), we set the experiments such
34:1144:88177:19:19:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that they give rise to the same deÖcit, expressed in dollar terms relative to the status quo. SpeciÖ-
34:1145:88278:19:19:71:540:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cally, both subsidies change average discounted after-tax income by 2%.32We evaluate the welfare

34:1147:88473:19:19:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:("willingness to pay"), i.e., the level of consumption that would make an average household indif-
34:1148:88571:19:19:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ferent between the pre- and post-policy regimes. We report changes in consumption and time use
34:1149:88665:19:18:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over three segments of the life cycle: the years before the birth of children, the period where the
34:1150:88764:18:19:72:467:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household has young children (below the age of 10), and the period that follows it.
34:1151:88847:19:19:86:539:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As the results in Table 10 show, the two policy changes produce very di§erent behavioral and
34:1152:88939:19:19:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:welfare responses. The unconditional subsidy boosts consumption especially in periods where the
34:1153:89034:19:19:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:household has young children ñthese are the periods in which the subsidy is received, and are also
34:1154:89132:19:19:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the periods where the price of consumption is higher. Interestingly, while there is little increase
34:1155:89231:19:19:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in consumption in the post-young children period, there is a signiÖcant increase in consumption in
34:1156:89329:19:19:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the pre-children period. This is a period when households tend to be liquidity constrained, at least
34:1157:89429:19:19:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:partly accumulating savings for the period when they will have young children. Increasing income
34:1158:89525:19:17:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the period when children are present (through the subsidy) allows them to reduce savings and
34:1159:89620:17:19:80:539:155:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:32The value of the subsidy is calculated for the period where the household have young children. Since changes to
34:1160:89733:19:15:72:540:136:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:policy parameters generate behavioral responses, we use an iterative procedure to Önd the changes in policy parameter
34:1161:89850:15:0:72:306:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:F:that generate the required 2% change in after-tax income.
35:1162:89909:0:19:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase consumption in the pre-children period. Consistent with the direct wealth e§ect of the
35:1163:90004:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unconditional subsidy, households also increase leisure and time spent with kids at the expenses of
35:1164:90103:19:19:72:140:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hours of work.
35:1165:90117:19:19:86:539:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Unlike the unconditional subsidy, the employment subsidy has a large impact on labor supply,
35:1166:90209:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:especially of women. Due to the large decline in the Öxed cost of employment, the subsidy increases
35:1167:90308:19:19:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:participation for women with young children by 13% (from astatus quovalue of 0.75) and increases
35:1168:90404:19:19:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hours worked by 6.5%. The employment subsidy also reduces leisure and especially time spent with
35:1169:90500:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:kids for the wife, along with a slight reduction in labor supply and a slight increase in time spent
35:1170:90600:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with the kids for the husband. The latter is far too small to o§set the decline in childcare hours
35:1171:90698:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the wife, resulting in an overall decline in family childcare hours. Note that our model does
35:1172:90794:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not explicitly account for how changes in parental employment a§ects the welfare of children (see
35:1173:90891:19:19:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Del Boca et al., 2014, for some evidence). Like in the Örst policy, consumption increases in the
35:1174:90987:19:19:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pre-children period for similar reasons (the large decline in the Öxed cost of work reduces the need
35:1175:91087:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to save in anticipation of the arrival of children); unlike the Örst policy, however, the change in
35:1176:91186:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption during the period where households have younger children is slightly negative due to
35:1177:91282:19:19:72:471:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the fact that the policy reduces consumption expenditure on the Öxed cost of work.
35:1178:91364:19:19:86:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We also report, separately for each policy experiment, the "willingness to pay" (expressed in
35:1179:91457:19:19:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:terms of lifetime consumption).  Households appear to gain much more from the unconditional
35:1180:91548:19:19:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy than from receiving compensation for the Öxed cost of work induced by the presence of
35:1181:91641:19:19:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children.  This result is partly intuitive - households have greater leverage in deciding how to
35:1182:91737:19:19:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allocate the unconditional subsidy to the various margins of behavior.  However, this does not
35:1183:91831:19:19:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily mean that the two policies would be equivalent if all households worked.  In fact,
35:1184:91925:19:19:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:borrowing constraints make an extra unconditional dollar much more valuable, in welfare terms,
35:1185:92019:19:41:72:331:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than a conditional subsidy even conditioning on work.
35:1186:92072:41:30:72:180:230:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:8  Conclusions
35:1187:92086:30:19:93:539:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we have considered a life cycle model in which households enjoy utility from
35:1188:92177:19:19:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the leisure times of husband and wife and from consuming both non-childcare goods and childcare
35:1189:92272:19:19:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:services. The latter, in the spirit of one of Beckerís seminal contributions, is home produced using
35:1190:92372:19:19:72:540:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as inputs the time allocated by parents to the care of their children, and childcare related goods.
35:1191:92471:19:0:72:537:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The wage rate is the opportunity cost of time use alternative to the market (leisure or childcare).
36:1192:92572:0:19:86:539:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We argue that in an environment with uncertainty, hours devoted to the various activities
36:1193:92661:19:19:72:540:689:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(work, leisure, childcare) serve two roles. First, they can be used to produce "commodities", such
36:1194:92759:19:19:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as childcare (as substitute inputs of a production function) or companionship (as complements in
36:1195:92855:19:19:72:540:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:utility). Second, they can be changed to provide insurance against wage shocks (either in response
36:1196:92953:19:19:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to own shocks if wealth e§ects dominate substitution e§ects, or as added worker e§ects in response
36:1197:93051:19:19:72:247:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to shocks faced by the other earner).
36:1198:93088:19:19:86:539:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We Önd that the response of a motherís labor supply to a transitory wage shock faced by her
36:1199:93179:19:19:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spouse (cross-Frisch elasticity) is negative.  This is because the large complementarity desire to
36:1200:93277:19:19:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spend time together is more than counteracted by the input substitutability in the production
36:1201:93370:19:19:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:function of childcare. Similarly, we Önd that own-Frisch elasticity are large because usual intertem-
36:1202:93471:19:19:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:poral substitution e§ects are compounded by reducing time spent with children due to the higher
36:1203:93566:19:19:72:292:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity cost induced by the wage change.
36:1204:93610:19:19:86:539:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our results suggest that, although some of the female labor supply responses are derived from
36:1205:93703:19:19:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an adjustment in female leisure hours, there is a large response in the time she spends with her
36:1206:93799:19:19:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:children. For an adverse permanent shock to the husbandís wage this implies a signiÖcant reduction
36:1207:93897:19:19:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in her time with her children. The estimates suggest this is not made up with a similar increase in
