3:69:973:14:13:83:508:495:144:Times:144:Times:We study the effect of state ownership on the market-to-book ratios of publicly traded 
3:70:1060:13:14:83:509:482:144:Times:144:Times:European  utilities  observed  from  1994  to  2005.  We  find  that  when  the  company  is  
3:71:1154:14:14:83:509:468:144:Times:144:Times:subject  to  independent  regulation,  state  ownership  is  positively  associated  with  firm  
3:72:1251:14:14:83:511:454:144:Times:144:Times:value.  This  effect  is  strong  and  significant  in  countries  where  weak  checks  and  
3:73:1344:14:14:83:509:440:144:Times:144:Times:balances  and  political  fragmentation  do  not  constrain  the  power  of  the  executive.  We  
3:74:1442:14:13:83:510:426:144:Times:144:Times:conclude  that  where  political  institutions  are  weak,  politicians  imperfectly  delegate  
3:75:1538:13:13:83:400:413:144:Times:121:Times:powers to regulatory agencies in order to benefit state-owned firms.

4:104:3755:21:21:74:163:694:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction  
4:105:3771:21:13:74:77:673:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:106:3771:13:21:92:544:660:144:Times:144:Times:Three  decades  after  the  start  of  the  largest  transfer  of  ownership  in  the  history  of  the  
4:107:3876:21:21:56:542:639:144:Times:144:Times:corporation  privatization  is  fading  away.  Since  the  turn  of  the  century,  state  assets  divestiture  has  
4:108:3993:21:21:56:542:618:144:Times:144:Times:been  slowing  down  in  most  developed  economies  and  advancing  somehow  in  emerging  countries  
4:109:4096:21:20:56:542:597:144:Times:144:Times:due to the initial floatation of large State-owned Enterprises (SOEs). However, around the world the 
4:110:4197:20:21:56:545:577:144:Times:144:Times:most  common  outcome  of  this  process  is  government  control  of  (partly)  privatized  firms,  a  
4:111:4301:21:21:56:545:556:144:Times:144:Times:qualifying  feature  of  the  so-called  “rise  of  state  capitalism”.1  Interestingly,  and  contrary  to  
4:112:4410:21:20:56:542:535:144:Times:144:Times:conventional  wisdom,  residual  control rights by the government do not affect negatively the value 
4:113:4511:20:21:56:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  firm.  Recent  evidence  has  shown  that  partial  privatization  improves  financial  and  operating  
4:114:4624:21:21:56:542:494:144:Times:144:Times:performance (Gupta, 2005) and that firms under government control tend to be more valuable than 
4:115:4720:21:20:56:410:473:144:Times:144:Times:fully privatized firms (Beltratti et al., 2007; Bortolotti and Faccio, 2009). 
4:116:4798:20:21:92:551:453:144:Times:144:Times:Public    utilities,    i.e.    firms    operating    in    network    industries,    such    as    energy,    
4:117:4909:21:21:56:543:432:144:Times:144:Times:telecommunication,  transports,  and  water,  had  a  great  bearing  in  past  privatization  processes.  In  
4:118:5020:21:21:56:545:411:144:Times:144:Times:most  developed  countries,  sales  advanced  in  parallel  with  deep  structural  reforms  promoting  
4:119:5124:21:20:56:544:390:144:Times:144:Times:liberalization and regulation of former state monopolies to boost efficiency and private investment.2  
4:120:5227:20:21:56:545:370:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  European  Union,  for  example,  the  Commission  urged  the  member  states  to  establish  
4:121:5329:21:21:56:547:349:144:Times:144:Times:Independent   Regulatory   Authorities   (IRAs),   i.e.   autonomous   public   organizations   to   which   
4:122:5438:21:20:56:542:328:144:Times:144:Times:governments  delegate  the  regulatory  policy.  Yet,  government  control  of  privatized/regulated  firms  
4:123:5547:20:21:56:542:308:144:Times:144:Times:is commonly observed also in public utilities.3 Interestingly, we observe a similar effect of residual 
4:124:5650:21:21:56:543:287:144:Times:144:Times:state  ownership  on  firm  value:  higher  state  ownership  is  associated  to  higher  firm  value,  but  this  
4:125:5765:21:20:56:538:266:144:Times:144:Times:happens only when the firm becomes subject to an IRA. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of market-
4:126:5864:20:21:56:541:246:144:Times:144:Times:to-book ratios of European telecom and energy utilities before and after the official establishment of 
4:127:5967:21:21:56:543:225:144:Times:144:Times:respective  IRAs.  We  notice  that,  in  the  three-year  period  after  the  event,  state-controlled  firms  
4:128:6079:21:21:56:366:204:144:Times:144:Times:outperform privately controlled firms by 15 percent on average. 
4:129:6143:21:20:92:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:Aim  of  this  paper  is  twofold:  first,  we  evaluate  empirically  the  effect  of  government  
4:130:6243:20:21:56:544:163:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  on  the  market  value  of  public  utilities,  controlling  for  other  possible  determinants.  
4:131:6352:21:25:56:541:142:144:Times:144:Times:Second, should this relation exist, we try to establish the channel linking government ownership to

4:133:6500:8:16:56:541:109:42:Times:100:Times:1 According to a recent report on state capitalism, the combined market value of global SOEs is more than $2 trillion 
4:134:6618:16:7:56:369:93:100:Times:100:Times:and total employment around 6 million (The Economist, January 21st, 2012).   
4:135:6695:7:16:56:543:86:42:Times:100:Times:2  Utilities  accounted  for  two  thirds  of  the  privatization  revenues  raised  in  European  countries  from  1977  to  date

4:137:6860:7:0:56:477:63:42:Times:100:Times:3 In the European Union, 85 per cent of privatized utilities are under government control (Roland, 2008).

5:139:7080:21:21:56:542:739:144:Times:144:Times:panel  dataset  of  88  publicly  traded  network  utilities  from  14  EU  countries  observed  from  1994  to  
5:140:7193:21:21:56:544:718:144:Times:144:Times:2005,  which  includes  10  of  the  top  30  companies  in  terms  of  market  capitalization  within  the  
5:141:7302:21:20:56:538:697:144:Times:144:Times:European  Industrial  Sector  (Mediobanca  Investment  Bank,  2009).  Estimates  rely  on  both  cross-
5:142:7405:20:21:56:540:677:144:Times:144:Times:country and within-country variation in the data around regulatory reforms and political institutions. 
5:143:7508:21:21:92:545:656:144:Times:144:Times:Why  should  governments  own  firms?  Conventional  wisdom  and  a  bulk  of  theoretical  
5:144:7600:21:20:56:545:635:144:Times:144:Times:literature  suggest  that  politicians  are  “bad  owners”  of  corporations  as  they  typically  impose  
5:145:7707:20:21:56:542:615:144:Times:144:Times:objectives  that  destroy  shareholders’  value  (Shapiro  and  Willig,  1990;  Shleifer  and  Vishny,  1994;  
5:146:7818:21:21:56:544:594:144:Times:144:Times:Bennedsen,  2000).4  At  the  same  time,  politicians  are  also  viewed  as  “bad  regulators”  as  their  
5:147:7927:21:20:56:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:interference may lead to time-inconsistent regulatory decisions and to the expropriation of utilities’ 
5:148:8030:20:21:56:543:553:144:Times:144:Times:sunk  investments  (Stigler,  1971).  These  arguments  provide  the  rationale  for  the  privatization  of  
5:149:8140:21:21:56:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:SOEs,  insofar  as  the  transfer  of  ownership  rights  to  the  private  sector  improves  incentives  and  
5:150:8251:21:20:56:543:511:144:Times:144:Times:boosts  operating  performance  (Megginson  and  Netter,  2001),  and  for  the  setting  up  of  IRAs,  in  
5:151:8360:20:21:56:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:order  to  foster  the  credibility  of  regulatory  commitments  (Levy  and  Spiller,  1994;  Baldwin  and  
5:152:8469:21:21:56:121:470:144:Times:144:Times:Cave, 1999). 
5:153:8482:21:21:92:543:449:144:Times:144:Times:However,  the  existence  of  a  legally  (de  jure)  independent  regulator  is  not  sufficient  to  
5:154:8585:21:20:56:543:428:144:Times:144:Times:ensure  real  (de  facto)  independent  decisions,  because  genuine  independence  hinges,  among  other  
5:155:8692:20:21:56:541:408:144:Times:144:Times:things, upon the real powers that the political system delegates to the agency, in other words upon 
5:156:8792:21:21:56:542:387:144:Times:144:Times:the residual rights to intervene in regulatory decisions retained by incumbent politicians.5 We label 
5:157:8894:21:20:56:543:366:144:Times:144:Times:reluctant  regulation  the  institutional  setting  when  regulatory  powers  are  delegated  to  a  formally  
5:158:9005:20:21:56:382:346:144:Times:144:Times:independent regulator, but subject de facto to political interference. 
5:159:9076:21:21:92:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:Reluctant  regulation  matters  when  the  government  retains  significant  ownership  rights  in  
5:160:9176:21:20:56:543:304:144:Times:144:Times:regulated  firms.  In  this  case,  politicians  may  wield  their  powers  to  obtain  favourable  regulatory  
5:161:9288:20:21:56:542:284:144:Times:144:Times:decisions that boost the utilities’ profitability, and this in turn allows the government, for example, 
5:162:9392:21:21:56:542:263:144:Times:144:Times:to  raise  additional  fiscal  revenues  via  extra-dividends  and  to  avoid  tax  increases,  spending  cuts  or  
5:163:9508:21:21:56:544:242:144:Times:144:Times:other  politically  costly  decisions  or  to  promote  “national  champions”.  The  expectation  that  the  
5:164:9617:21:20:56:543:221:144:Times:144:Times:government  gives  a  “helping  hand”  indirectly  via  regulation  boosts  the  market  value  of  utilities  
5:165:9728:20:21:56:545:201:144:Times:144:Times:under  mixed  (private-public)  ownership,  with  private  shareholders  sharing  the  financial  rent  
5:166:9832:21:29:56:249:180:144:Times:144:Times:provided for by the public shareholder.  
5:167:9873:29:7:56:203:151:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:168:9921:7:16:56:544:144:42:Times:100:Times:4  In  this  perspective,  privatization  can  be  seen  as  a  safeguard  against  the  opportunistic  behavior  of  politicians  
5:169:10052:16:7:56:381:128:100:Times:100:Times:(Sappington and Stiglitz, 1987). See also the recent survey by Martimort (2006). 
5:170:10133:7:16:56:541:121:42:Times:100:Times:5 Alesina and Tabellini (2008), studying the normative criteria that allocate tasks between politicians and bureaucrats, 
5:171:10254:16:12:56:541:105:100:Times:100:Times:point  out  that  regulation  of  public  utilities  is  an  example  of  “policies  that  lend  themselves  to  bureaucratic  delegation,  
5:172:10394:12:11:56:541:93:100:Times:100:Times:since they pit special interests against those of consumers as a whole”. However, such a delegation comes to a cost in 
5:173:10513:11:12:56:541:82:100:Times:100:Times:terms of the loss of political control over the industry leading to imperfect delegation of power. In fact, “institutions are 
5:174:10639:12:11:56:538:70:100:Times:100:Times:more  likely  to  be  designed  so  as  to  deliver  maximal  rents  at  the  lowest  risk  for  the  incumbent  politician”  (page  444-
5:175:10776:11:0:56:82:59:100:Times:100:Times:445).  
6:176:10784:0:21:92:541:760:144:Times:144:Times:To establish the link between residual state ownership and regulated firms’ market value, we 
6:177:10877:21:21:56:542:739:144:Times:144:Times:focus  on  reluctant  regulation  as  possible  channel  by  exploiting  the  heterogeneity  in  the  ownership  
6:178:10990:21:21:56:543:718:144:Times:144:Times:patterns  and  in  the  regulatory  settings.  The  seminal  study  by  Levy  and  Spiller  (1994)  shows  that  
6:179:11103:21:20:56:543:697:144:Times:144:Times:political  interference  in  regulatory  decisions  is  more  likely  when  the  institutional  constraints  on  
6:180:11216:20:21:56:543:677:144:Times:144:Times:executive  discretion  are  weak.  In  this  case,  regulatory  commitment  is  less  credible  since  political  
6:181:11330:21:21:56:542:656:144:Times:144:Times:powers  can  more  easily  overturn  administrative  decisions.  Formal  institutional  arrangements  that  
6:182:11438:21:20:56:544:635:144:Times:144:Times:constrain  executive  discretion  typically  include  the  explicit  separation  of  powers,  an  effective  
6:183:11547:20:21:56:543:615:144:Times:144:Times:“checks  and  balance”  system  between  the  different  branches  of  the  government,  and  an  electoral  
6:184:11656:21:21:56:544:594:144:Times:144:Times:system  that  enhances  party  proliferation  and  political  fragmentation.  We  thus  expect  reluctant  
6:185:11763:21:20:56:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:regulation to surface where institutional constraints are weak providing governments’ incentives to 
6:186:11863:20:21:56:541:553:144:Times:144:Times:retain higher stakes in regulated firms. Where instead one country’s institutional endowment fosters 
6:187:11964:21:21:56:544:532:144:Times:144:Times:genuine  independent  regulation,  residual  public  ownership  should  be  completely  neutral  with  
6:188:12067:21:20:56:164:511:144:Times:144:Times:respect to firm value.  
6:189:12091:20:21:92:545:491:144:Times:144:Times:Our  empirical  results  are  consistent  with  our  predictions.  We  find  that  residual  state  
6:190:12191:21:21:56:542:470:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  positively  affects  the  market  value  of  regulated  firms  and  that  this  effect  is  significant  
6:191:12307:21:21:56:543:449:144:Times:144:Times:only  where  political  institutions  do  not  effectively  restrain  governments’  power.  Importantly,  in  a  
6:192:12420:21:20:56:546:428:144:Times:144:Times:model   where   we   take   fully   into   account   the   endogeneity   of   residual   state   ownership   and   
6:193:12535:20:21:56:542:408:144:Times:144:Times:independent regulation, we show that political institutions affect firm value only indirectly, and that 
6:194:12639:21:21:56:545:387:144:Times:144:Times:residual  stakes  by  the  government  are  the  only  channel  through  which  institutions  affect  the  
6:195:12746:21:20:56:542:366:144:Times:144:Times:valuation  of  regulated  firms.  Results  survive  when  we  account  for  sectors  characteristics,  country  
6:196:12858:20:21:56:542:346:144:Times:144:Times:specificity,  thresholds  of  ownership  and  control  rights,  and  for  the  extent  of  market  liberalization,  
6:197:12974:21:21:56:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:supporting  the  view  that  reluctant  regulation  is  a  fundamental  driver  of  the  performance  of  public  
6:198:13088:21:20:56:107:304:144:Times:144:Times:utilities.    
6:199:13102:20:21:92:544:284:144:Times:144:Times:Several  papers  have  addressed  related  issues.  For  example,  some  empirical  studies  have  
6:200:13201:21:21:56:541:263:144:Times:144:Times:shown that political institutions are significant determinants of structural reforms such as regulatory 
6:201:13305:21:21:56:542:242:144:Times:144:Times:decisions  (Duso,  2005;  Guerriero,  2011),  market  liberalization  (Pitlik,  2007;  Potrafke,  2010;  Duso  
6:202:13416:21:20:56:542:221:144:Times:144:Times:and Seldeslachts, 2010) and privatisation (Li and Xu, 2002; Bortolotti and Faccio, 2009; Dinc and 
6:203:13514:20:21:56:542:201:144:Times:144:Times:Gupta,  2011).6  In  a  similar  vein,  Edwards  and  Waverman  (2006)  have  addressed  the  link  between  
6:204:13623:21:21:56:545:180:144:Times:144:Times:government  ownership  and  regulatory  independence.  Using  a  sample  of  15  EU  incumbent  
6:205:13719:21:20:56:542:159:144:Times:144:Times:telecommunications  operators  tracked  from  1997  to  2003,  the  authors  show  that  public  ownership  
6:206:13827:20:21:56:546:139:144:Times:144:Times:of   the   incumbent   positively   affects   wholesale   rates,   suggesting   that   governments   influence   
6:207:13940:21:36:56:542:118:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory  outcomes  in  favour  of  incumbents  where  they  have  substantially  invested  in.  However,  
6:208:14049:36:7:56:203:82:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:209:14097:7:16:56:542:75:42:Times:100:Times:6  In  a  different,  but  related  field,  Albalate  et  al.  (2012)  study  the  political  institution  determinants  of  the  provision  of  
6:210:14242:16:0:56:277:59:100:Times:100:Times:public goods, with an application to military spending. 
7:211:14299:0:21:56:541:760:144:Times:144:Times:this effect is mitigated in presence of institutional features enhancing regulatory independence from 
7:212:14401:21:21:56:140:739:144:Times:144:Times:the government.  
7:213:14418:21:21:92:541:718:144:Times:144:Times:To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first systematic analysis on the impact of state 
7:214:14514:21:20:56:541:697:144:Times:144:Times:ownership on regulated firms’ market value in the EU introducing political institution and the novel 
7:215:14615:20:21:56:437:677:144:Times:144:Times:concept of reluctant regulation as explanatory factor of this empirical relation.  
7:216:14698:21:21:92:543:656:144:Times:144:Times:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2  we  describe  the  institutional  
7:217:14804:21:20:56:542:635:144:Times:144:Times:context.  In  Section  3  we  present  our  research  design  and  the  estimation  strategy.  In  Section  4,  we  
7:218:14920:20:21:56:543:615:144:Times:144:Times:describe  our  data,  specifically  the  sample,  the  firm  level  data  and  the  regulatory,  ownership  and  
7:219:15033:21:21:56:542:594:144:Times:144:Times:political  variables.  In  Section  5  we  present  the  empirical  results  from  estimating  the  market  value  
7:220:15148:21:20:56:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:regression, while in Section 6 we account for the effect of different political institutions. In Section 
7:221:15253:20:45:56:342:553:144:Times:144:Times:7 we present some robustness checks. Section 8 concludes. 
7:222:15311:45:33:92:468:508:144:Times:144:Times:2. The Institutional Reforms in the Utility Sectors in the European Union 
7:223:15384:33:20:92:542:475:144:Times:144:Times:Following a big wave of nationalization after the Second World War, vertically integrated, 
7:224:15475:20:21:56:545:455:144:Times:144:Times:stated-owned,  monopolies  largely  dominated  European  network  industries.  Under  this  regime,  
7:225:15576:21:21:56:542:434:144:Times:144:Times:utilities were an operational branch of the government and instructed to provide universal services 
7:226:15676:21:21:56:541:413:144:Times:144:Times:at low prices, absorb unemployment, and invest in infrastructure. The government in turn played the 
7:227:15776:21:20:56:543:392:144:Times:144:Times:dual  role  of  owner  and  “regulator,”  and  set  tariffs,  quality  standards,  and  investment  levels.  This  
7:228:15891:20:21:56:542:372:144:Times:144:Times:arrangement  however  created  ill-performing  and  highly  inefficient  public  monopolies  (Megginson  
7:229:15996:21:21:56:146:351:144:Times:144:Times:and Netter, 2001). 
7:230:16015:21:20:92:545:330:144:Times:144:Times:Starting  from  the  mid  1980’s  in  the  UK,  and  early  1990’s  in  the  rest  of  Europe,  the  
7:231:16116:20:21:56:545:310:144:Times:144:Times:European  Commission  promoted  a  gradual  liberalization  and  regulatory  process  intended  to  
7:232:16216:21:21:56:542:289:144:Times:144:Times:improve the efficiency and service quality of EU public utilities and increase their investments. In 
7:233:16317:21:20:56:542:268:144:Times:144:Times:particular, the European Commission enacted a number of directives aimed at setting up a common 
7:234:16413:20:21:56:544:248:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory  framework  for  EU  member  states,  which  were  in  turn  required  to  transpose  these  
7:235:16517:21:21:56:228:227:144:Times:144:Times:directives into national legislation.  
7:236:16556:21:21:92:542:206:144:Times:144:Times:One  of  the  most  important  of  these  EU-driven  reforms  is  perhaps  the  institution  of  IRAs,  
7:237:16660:21:20:56:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:charged  with  the  duty  to  regulate  the  activity  of  network  industries  and  to  discipline  the  potential  
7:238:16777:20:21:56:545:165:144:Times:144:Times:conflict  of  interest  between  the  government  and  state-controlled  utilities.  Typically,  delegated  
7:239:16885:21:21:56:541:144:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory tasks involve price-setting decisions both at retail and wholesale level - whenever access 
7:240:16987:21:20:56:541:123:144:Times:144:Times:to essential facility is needed to develop market competition -, the definition of entry conditions, the 
7:241:17092:20:21:56:543:103:144:Times:144:Times:imposition of quality standards and all the technical rules to use or access to existing infrastructures.  
7:242:17199:21:21:92:546:82:144:Times:144:Times:The   IRAs   ought   to   operate   with   their   own   specialized   staff   and   detailed   mandate,   
7:243:17306:21:0:56:544:61:144:Times:144:Times:independently  of  ministries  or  government  departments.  The  European  Commission  especially  
8:244:17407:0:21:56:538:760:144:Times:144:Times:urged member states’ governments to establish national independent regulators at least in economy-
8:245:17505:21:21:56:544:739:144:Times:144:Times:wide  sectors  like  energy  and  telecommunications,  sometimes  under  the  threat  of  infringement  
8:246:17609:21:21:56:542:718:144:Times:144:Times:procedures before the European Court of Justice.7 Nevertheless, the European Commission left the 
8:247:17706:21:20:56:542:697:144:Times:144:Times:decision about the definition and the scope of the delegated powers entirely in the hands of national 
8:248:17808:20:21:56:541:677:144:Times:144:Times:governments.  This  process  of  delegation  led  to  the  creation  of  formally  independent (de  jure) 
8:249:17913:21:21:56:543:656:144:Times:144:Times:agencies.  However,  de  facto  independence  clearly  hinged  upon  how  this  delegation  process  was  
8:250:18019:21:20:56:543:635:144:Times:144:Times:implemented  in  each  member  state.  Indeed,  agencies  usually  are  not  fully  independent  because  
8:251:18125:20:21:56:523:615:144:Times:144:Times:political executives often retain ultimate responsibility for their activities (Verhoest et al., 2012). 
8:252:18229:21:21:92:543:594:144:Times:144:Times:As  for  privatization,  the  European  Commission  left  the  decision  about  the  ownership  of  
8:253:18329:21:20:56:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:regulated energy utilities entirely in the hands of national governments (see Bortolotti et al., 2003). 
8:254:18433:20:21:56:542:553:144:Times:144:Times:As a result, after more than a decade, many large EU utilities are still controlled by central and local 
8:255:18538:21:21:56:539:532:144:Times:144:Times:governments, especially as far as France, Germany, and Italy, and the energy sector, are concerned.  
8:256:18639:21:20:92:541:511:144:Times:144:Times:The implementation of these institutional reforms (modern regulation, privatization, market 
8:257:18731:20:21:56:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:liberalization)  varies  considerably  across  EU  countries  and  sectors.  Table  1  reports  the  year  in  
8:258:18842:21:21:56:543:470:144:Times:144:Times:which  an  IRA  was  established,  the  timing  of  transposition  of  sectoral  directives  in  each  Member  
8:259:18953:21:21:56:542:449:144:Times:144:Times:State, and the allocation of proceeds from privatization over time. The data refer only to energy and 
8:260:19055:21:20:56:543:428:144:Times:144:Times:telecoms  because  in  water  supply  and  transport  infrastructure  a  common  regulatory  framework  is  
8:261:19163:20:21:56:545:408:144:Times:144:Times:still  under  construction,  IRAs  still  do  not  exist  (so  regulation  is  carried  out  by  government  
8:262:19272:21:21:56:541:387:144:Times:144:Times:committees or within ministries) and privatization process are lagging behind. As shown in Table 1, 
8:263:19372:21:20:56:542:366:144:Times:144:Times:in  most  member  states,  privatizations  in  energy  and  telecoms  followed  the  implementation  of  EC  
8:264:19481:20:21:56:435:346:144:Times:144:Times:directives on the adoption of regulatory framework and the inception of IRAs. 
8:265:19559:21:21:92:543:325:144:Times:144:Times:Reforms  are  most  advanced  in  the  telecom  industry,  where  liberalization  started  in  1987  
8:266:19660:21:20:56:545:304:144:Times:144:Times:with  the  publication  of  the  Green  Paper  for  the  Development  of  the  Common  Market  for  
8:267:19760:20:21:56:544:284:144:Times:144:Times:telecommunication  services  and  equipment.  The  Green  Paper  was  followed  by  a  sequence  of  
8:268:19861:21:21:56:542:263:144:Times:144:Times:directives,  starting  from  Directive  90/388  on  “Competition  in  the  markets  for  telecommunications  
8:269:19970:21:21:56:542:242:144:Times:144:Times:services,” which established the institution of national IRAs in each Member State. Table 1 shows 
8:270:20068:21:20:56:542:221:144:Times:144:Times:that  independent  regulatory  agencies  now  operate  in  virtually  all  member  states:  in  the  U.K.  the  
8:271:20180:20:21:56:542:201:144:Times:144:Times:IRA was established in 1984, while in the other EU countries IRAs were set up in mid nineties. As 
8:272:20278:21:21:56:544:180:144:Times:144:Times:for  firm  ownership,  at  the  onset  of  the  liberalization  process,  the  European  Commission  raised  
8:273:20387:21:31:56:545:159:144:Times:144:Times:concerns  about  residual  state  ownership  in  telecoms  companies.8  As  of  2005,  most  telecom  
8:274:20489:31:7:56:203:128:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
8:275:20537:7:16:56:542:121:42:Times:100:Times:7 Recently, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Luxemburg, Romania and Slovakia 
8:276:20648:16:7:56:538:105:100:Times:100:Times:regarding the telecoms authority’s independence and its internal organization. See European Commission (2010; p. 44). 
8:277:20766:7:16:56:541:98:42:Times:100:Times:8 “In some Member States, concerns are reported that the structures in place do not ensure that regulatory decisions are 
8:278:20887:16:12:56:544:82:100:Times:100:Times:not  influenced  by  State  ownership  considerations.  In  these  cases,  the  necessary  separation  of  the  control  of  the  
8:279:21017:12:11:56:544:70:100:Times:100:Times:incumbent  and  the  regulatory  powers  should  be  re-examined  (Belgium,  Finland,  Luxembourg,  Ireland,  France)”  
8:280:21137:11:0:56:218:59:100:Times:100:Times:(European Commission, 1999, pag. 15). 
9:281:21176:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:companies were (at least partially) privatized and governments held majority of control only in the 
9:282:21276:21:21:56:226:739:144:Times:144:Times:German and Swedish incumbents.  
9:283:21308:21:21:92:541:718:144:Times:144:Times:Market liberalization reforms are well ahead also in the energy sector, where the majority of 
9:284:21402:21:20:56:542:697:144:Times:144:Times:electric and gas utilities are subject to regulation by an IRAs. The milestone legislation is Directive 
9:285:21506:20:21:56:542:677:144:Times:144:Times:96/92 for the electricity, followed by Directive 98/30 for the gas market; these directives aimed at 
9:286:21607:21:21:56:543:656:144:Times:144:Times:gradually  introducing  competition  in  generation  and  retail  segments,  as  well  as  at  unbundling  the  
9:287:21719:21:20:56:542:635:144:Times:144:Times:various  segments  of  the  energy  value  chain.  Importantly,  these  directives  established  independent  
9:288:21829:20:21:56:542:615:144:Times:144:Times:national regulatory agencies: the U.K. was again the first country in Europe to establish an IRA in 
9:289:21929:21:21:56:542:594:144:Times:144:Times:1989, the other countries followed from 1995 to 2000, while Germany was the last one to set up an 
9:290:22027:21:20:56:544:573:144:Times:144:Times:IRA  for  energy  utilities  in  2006.  As  regards  firm  ownership,  the  only  fully  privatized  energy  
9:291:22136:20:21:56:542:553:144:Times:144:Times:utilities are British. At the opposite side stands the French government, which, with its larger than 
9:292:22238:21:21:56:541:532:144:Times:144:Times:80% stake in both Gaz de France and Electricitè de France (and the 32% stake in Telecom France), 
9:293:22335:21:20:56:388:511:144:Times:144:Times:appears as the most reluctant to release control in regulated utilities.  
9:294:22409:20:21:92:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:Finally,  in  water  supply  and  in  transportation  infrastructure  (docks  and  ports,  airports  and  
9:295:22515:21:21:56:542:470:144:Times:144:Times:freight  motorways)  structural  reforms  still  lag  behind.  With  the  exception  of  the  U.K.,  most  water  
9:296:22629:21:21:56:544:449:144:Times:144:Times:and  transportation  utilities  are  still  controlled  by  central  and  local  governments  and  subject  to  
9:297:22741:21:20:56:542:428:144:Times:144:Times:regulation by ministries or other branches of the government rather than by independent regulatory 
9:298:22840:20:45:56:106:408:144:Times:144:Times:agencies.  
9:299:22851:45:33:92:195:363:144:Times:144:Times:3. Research Design  
9:300:22871:33:26:92:235:330:144:Times:144:Times:3.1 Theoretical Framework 
9:301:22897:26:27:92:514:304:144:Times:144:Times:Our initial question is: how does ownership affect firm value when an IRA is in place?  
9:302:22985:27:21:92:542:277:144:Times:144:Times:When  there  is  not  an  IRA  in  place,  self-interested  politicians  may  exploit  state-controlled  
9:303:23090:21:20:56:545:256:144:Times:144:Times:utilities  to  extract  rents  from  social  investment  and  employment  programs  that  result  in  low  
9:304:23197:20:21:56:543:236:144:Times:144:Times:profitability  and  inefficiency  (see  for  example  Megginson  and  Netter,  2001).  In  this  case,  private  
9:305:23310:21:27:56:277:215:144:Times:144:Times:investors will typically shun regulated firms.  
9:306:23358:27:21:92:542:188:144:Times:144:Times:The  establishment  of  IRAs  –  such  as  the  process  promoted  by  the  European  Commission  
9:307:23456:21:20:56:543:167:144:Times:144:Times:during  the  90s-  functionally  separates  the  (dual)  role  of  the  state  as  typical  large  shareholder  of  
9:308:23572:20:21:56:542:147:144:Times:144:Times:utilities and as regulator of the industry. The delegation act, formally shifting the regulatory powers 
9:309:23676:21:21:56:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:from the political sphere to an independent  bureaucratic entity, curbs ex ante political interference 
9:310:23779:21:20:56:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:and  opportunistic  behavior  by  self-interested  politicians  (Levy  and  Spiller,  1984;  Armstrong  and  
9:311:23888:20:0:56:545:85:144:Times:144:Times:Sappington,  2007).  The  enhanced  credibility  of  regulatory  commitments  will  attract  private  
10:312:23991:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:investment,  allowing  the  opening  up  of  capital  to  external  investors  and  -  should  commitments  be  
10:313:24103:21:27:56:318:739:144:Times:144:Times:sustained over time - full privatization (Perotti, 1995). 
10:314:24161:27:21:92:541:712:144:Times:144:Times:In theory, if regulators were de facto independent, IRAs should be able to thwart any attempt 
10:315:24255:21:20:56:541:691:144:Times:144:Times:to “capture” by politicians, regardless of the private or public status of the firm (Laffont and Tirole, 
10:316:24360:20:21:56:546:671:144:Times:144:Times:1986,  Sappington  and  Stiglitz,  1987).  However,  if  regulators  are  de  iure  but  not  de  facto  
10:317:24465:21:21:56:542:650:144:Times:144:Times:independent,  politicians  wield  regulatory  powers  and  have  incentives  to  retain  a  stake  in  the  firm  
10:318:24579:21:20:56:542:629:144:Times:144:Times:(Laffont  and  Tirole,  1991;  Laffont,  1996).  Indeed,  by  keeping  regulators  on  their  toes,  politicians  
10:319:24693:20:21:56:543:609:144:Times:144:Times:may  obtain  a  favorable  regulatory  treatment  of  the  state-owned  utility,  such  as  a  soft  regulatory  
10:320:24806:21:21:56:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:stance  (higher  tariffs,  higher  entry  barriers,  etc.)  in  order  to  increase  the  firm’s  profits  that  will  
10:321:24925:21:20:56:542:567:144:Times:144:Times:accrue,  via  dividends,  to  the  public  budget.  Private  investors  of  the  regulated  firm  will  share  the  
10:322:25041:20:21:56:542:547:144:Times:144:Times:benefits with the government and thus be willing to value positively its presence as shareholder in 
10:323:25141:21:21:56:544:526:144:Times:144:Times:firms.  This  “corporatist”  equilibrium  is  likely  to  exist  when  regulatory  powers  are  imperfectly  
10:324:25250:21:20:56:541:505:144:Times:144:Times:delegated  to  the  formally,  and  not  genuinely  IRAs,  i.e.  in  the  regime  that  we  refer  to  as  reluctant 
10:325:25367:20:27:56:116:485:144:Times:144:Times:regulation.9 
10:326:25379:27:21:92:544:458:144:Times:144:Times:Following  this  argument,  the  relevant  research  question  becomes:  under  what  conditions  
10:327:25477:21:21:56:541:437:144:Times:144:Times:does state ownership have a positive impact on firm value? Our working hypothesis is that this will 
10:328:25577:21:20:56:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:occur   where   reluctant   regulation is   more   likely,   i.e.   where   the   institutional   constraints   on   
10:329:25693:20:21:56:543:396:144:Times:144:Times:administrative  discretion  are  weaker.  To  test  this  hypothesis,  we  exploit  features  of  the  political  
10:330:25807:21:21:56:541:375:144:Times:144:Times:system that proxy the extent to which the executive’s powers are constrained by formal institutional 
10:331:25908:21:20:56:542:354:144:Times:144:Times:arrangements, and we predict that in those countries where such constraints are in place, regulators 
10:332:26009:20:27:56:516:334:144:Times:144:Times:will be less subject to political interference and state ownership will not matter for valuation.10  
10:333:26110:27:21:92:543:307:144:Times:144:Times:The  recent  political  economy  literature  has  developed  a  vast  array  of  variables  capturing  
10:334:26213:21:20:56:542:286:144:Times:144:Times:formal institutional arrangements that curb executive discretion or make policy reversal less likely 
10:335:26314:20:21:56:542:266:144:Times:144:Times:(see, among others, Acemoglu, 2005; Persson and Tabellini; 1999; Persson, 2002). As highlighted 
10:336:26410:21:21:56:542:245:144:Times:144:Times:by Levy and Spiller (1994), the credibility of regulation and the risk of political interference depend 
10:337:26514:21:21:56:541:224:144:Times:144:Times:on the structure and organization of political institutions, such as an effective “checks and balances” 
10:338:26618:21:20:56:545:203:144:Times:144:Times:system.  Another  important  institutional  feature  is  an  electoral  system,  which  leads  to  party  
10:339:26724:20:32:56:543:183:144:Times:144:Times:proliferation  and  political  fragmentation:  proportional  electoral  systems  make  policy  changes  less  
10:340:26834:32:7:56:203:151:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
10:341:26882:7:16:56:541:144:42:Times:100:Times:9 Under imperfect delegation of powers to the IRA, the politician may also extract the rent from   the regulated firm 
10:342:27000:16:12:56:541:128:100:Times:100:Times:through bribes. In this case, the politician would not have incentives to retain stakes in the firm. We would thus expect 
10:343:27122:12:11:56:542:116:100:Times:100:Times:to  see  full  privatization  cum  reluctant  regulation  where  corruption  is  more  widespread  (Shleifer  and  Vishny,  1994).  
10:344:27254:11:12:56:541:105:100:Times:100:Times:However, this alternative equilibrium is less likely to occur in developed economies such as the European countries for 
10:345:27374:12:7:56:243:93:100:Times:100:Times:which this theoretical framework is designed.  
10:346:27421:7:16:56:542:86:42:Times:100:Times:10 Alternative explanations could be set forth to explain why the firm value should be higher at state-controlled firms, 
10:347:27542:16:11:56:542:70:100:Times:100:Times:such  as  that  they  are  for  some  reason  more  efficient,  more  R&D  oriented,  better  managed  than  privately-controlled  
10:348:27673:11:0:56:303:59:100:Times:100:Times:firms. But, then, political institutions should not matter at all. 
11:349:27741:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:likely, thus enhancing the credibility of regulatory commitments; in contrast, majoritarian systems, 
11:350:27842:21:21:56:542:739:144:Times:144:Times:characterized  by  the  turnover  of  strong  governments  of  different  stripes,  expose  regulation  to  the  
11:351:27955:21:39:56:231:718:144:Times:144:Times:risk of unexpected policy changes.   
11:352:27992:39:32:92:219:679:144:Times:144:Times:3.2 Empirical Modeling  
11:353:28016:32:39:92:478:647:144:Times:144:Times:The central empirical relationship we are interested in is of the following form:  
11:354:28099:39:39:92:285:608:144:Times:144:Times:Yt = f (Government UCRt-1, IRAt-1, Xt-1), 
11:355:28141:39:20:56:544:569:144:Times:144:Times:where Yt  is  firm  value  (the  firm  market-to-book  ratio)  at  time  t, GovernmentUCRt-1  is  firm  
11:356:28245:20:21:56:543:549:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  (the  residual  ultimate  control  rights  held  by  the  government)  at  time  t-1, IRAt-1  is  a  
11:357:28357:21:21:56:541:528:144:Times:144:Times:dummy denoting the presence of an independent regulatory agency (as opposed to executive-branch 
11:358:28453:21:26:56:421:507:144:Times:144:Times:regulators or ministries) at time t-1and X t-1 is a vector of control variables.  
11:359:28535:26:21:92:547:481:144:Times:144:Times:When   exploring   this   relationship   empirically,   we   face   a   number   of   issues.   First,   
11:360:28640:21:21:56:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:government’s  residual  ownership  is  likely  to  be  endogenous  because  pay-out  expectations  and  
11:361:28744:21:20:56:541:439:144:Times:144:Times:investment opportunities affect the privatization decision. Second, endogeneity problems affect also 
11:362:28845:20:21:56:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:the  IRA  dummy,  since  the  government  may  have  an  incentive  to  set  up  the  IRA  in  sectors  where  
11:363:28956:21:21:56:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:profitability  is  expected  to  be  higher.  Moreover,  the  IRA  dummy  is  an  imperfect  measure  of  
11:364:29062:21:21:56:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory  independence  because  it  just  denotes  the  presence  of  a  regulatory  authority.  Third,  as  
11:365:29174:21:20:56:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:long as reluctant regulation matters only when the government retains significant ownership rights 
11:366:29273:20:21:56:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:in  regulated  firms,  we  must  consider  the  interaction  between  the  ownership  variable  and  the  IRA  
11:367:29384:21:21:56:542:315:144:Times:144:Times:dummy,  treating  the  resulting  term  also  as  potentially  endogenous.  Identification  is  thus  a  serious  
11:368:29498:21:26:56:244:294:144:Times:144:Times:issue that we will be discussed below.  
11:369:29538:26:21:92:541:268:144:Times:144:Times:Our empirical strategy is the following: to estimate the impact of residual state ownership on 
11:370:29633:21:21:56:542:247:144:Times:144:Times:regulated firms’ market value we first run OLS regressions where we enter the ownership variable 
11:371:29730:21:20:56:542:226:144:Times:144:Times:both linearly and interactively with the IRA dummy. Second, we investigate whether the estimated 
11:372:29827:20:21:56:542:206:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients of our variable of interest – the interaction between state ownership and IRA - differ in 
11:373:29930:21:21:56:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:sub-samples  characterized  by  institutional  arrangements  with  lower  or  higher  ability  to  constrain  
11:374:30040:21:21:56:542:164:144:Times:144:Times:executive discretion. Third, we try to establish the channel linking regulated firms’ value to residual 
11:375:30144:21:26:56:462:143:144:Times:144:Times:ownership by running a test of over-identifiying restrictions that we describe below. 
11:376:30230:26:27:92:95:117:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:377:30230:27:0:92:95:90:144:Times:144:Times: 
12:378:30232:0:32:92:327:759:144:Times:144:Times:3.3 Identification and Instrumental Variables 
12:379:30278:32:21:92:543:727:144:Times:144:Times:Under  a  regime  of  reluctant  regulation,  government’s  power  to  interfere  with  regulatory  
12:380:30378:21:21:56:542:706:144:Times:144:Times:policy  will  produce  economic  rents  that  will  boost  the  market  value  of  partially  privatized  firms.  
12:381:30492:21:20:56:541:685:144:Times:144:Times:The credibility of regulatory commitment hinges therefore upon the ability of the political system to 
12:382:30594:20:27:56:231:665:144:Times:144:Times:constrain administrative discretion.  
12:383:30632:27:21:92:545:638:144:Times:144:Times:Our  identification  strategy  rests  on  the  assumption  that  political  institutions  affect  the  
12:384:30735:21:20:56:543:617:144:Times:144:Times:latitude  of  government’s  residual  regulatory  powers  and  the  size  of  the  stake  retained  in  public  
12:385:30847:20:21:56:543:597:144:Times:144:Times:utilities.  This  qualifies  political  institutions  as  potentially  valid  instruments  and,  because  a  set  of  
12:386:30965:21:21:56:546:576:144:Times:144:Times:different   variables   is   available,   we   estimate   an   over-identified   model.   By   testing   that   our   
12:387:31083:21:20:56:544:555:144:Times:144:Times:instruments  do  not  have  a  direct  impact  on  firm  value  beyond  the  effect  they  exert  on  the  
12:388:31190:20:21:56:542:535:144:Times:144:Times:endogenous variables (see, for example, Persson, Roland and Tabellini, 2007; and Tabellini 2010), 
12:389:31288:21:27:56:455:514:144:Times:144:Times:we can isolate the channel through which political institutions affect market value. 
12:390:31373:27:20:92:545:487:144:Times:144:Times:To  find  suitable  instruments,  we  rely  on  political  economy  variables  identified  by  the  
12:391:31473:20:21:56:545:467:144:Times:144:Times:literature  on  the  credibility  of  regulatory  commitments.  For  example,  the  number  of  decision  
12:392:31579:21:21:56:544:446:144:Times:144:Times:makers  whose  agreement  is  necessary  before  policies  can  be  changed  is  a  key  feature  of  any  
12:393:31686:21:21:56:544:425:144:Times:144:Times:political  system.  Therefore,  our  first  political  economy  variable,  and  instrument,  is  Checks  &  
12:394:31794:21:20:56:542:404:144:Times:144:Times:Balances, a time-varying measure of the number of veto players in a political system, adjusting for 
12:395:31894:20:21:56:542:384:144:Times:144:Times:whether these veto players are independent of each other. The index also records whether the same 
12:396:31992:21:21:56:544:363:144:Times:144:Times:or  different  parties  control  the  executive  branch  and  the  legislature  in  presidential  systems,  or  
12:397:32104:21:20:56:544:342:144:Times:144:Times:whether  there  is  a  minority  government  or  a  coalition  of  one,  or  more  parties  controlling  the  
12:398:32214:20:21:56:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:government,  in  proportional  systems  (Beck  et  al.  2001,  pp.  169-170).  It  ranges  from  0  to  7  to  
12:399:32325:21:21:56:542:301:144:Times:144:Times:measure low vs. high degree and quality of the checks and balances and is sourced from the World 
12:400:32422:21:20:56:284:280:144:Times:144:Times:Bank DPI-Database on Political Institutions.11  
12:401:32470:20:21:92:542:260:144:Times:144:Times:The second political variable, complementary to checks and balances, accounts for the type 
12:402:32561:21:21:56:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:of electoral system, whether it leads to party proliferation or aggregation within the Parliamentary 
12:403:32662:21:21:56:541:218:144:Times:144:Times:system. We use the Electoral Disproportionality index, developed by Gallagher (1991) and updated 
12:404:32758:21:26:56:386:197:144:Times:144:Times:by Bortolotti and Pinotti (2008) according to the following formula:

12:406:32829:27:27:92:95:144:144:Times:144:Times: 
12:407:32829:27:20:56:541:117:144:Times:144:Times:where vi is the share of votes obtained by party in general elections, si is the seat share of the party i, 
12:408:32937:20:26:56:542:97:144:Times:144:Times:and N is the total number of parties in the legislature. The index is continuous and time varying; it

12:410:33087:8:0:56:453:63:42:Times:100:Times:11 This measure has been widely used in the literature (see, for example, Keefer and Knack, 2007).

13:422:33315:21:21:56:542:739:144:Times:144:Times:average, as the electoral rule moves towards the majoritarian system. By locating country-years in a 
13:423:33416:21:21:56:547:718:144:Times:144:Times:political   spectrum   ranging   from   the   majoritarian   and   the   so-called   “consensus”   model   of   
13:424:33528:21:20:56:541:697:144:Times:144:Times:democracy, the index is a measure of political fragmentation. A lower electoral disproportionality is 
13:425:33630:20:21:56:541:677:144:Times:144:Times:usually associated with a higher effective number of parties in legislature and government and more 
13:426:33730:21:27:56:229:656:144:Times:144:Times:stable executives (Lijphart, 1999).   
13:427:33768:27:20:92:542:629:144:Times:144:Times:The instrument set then includes country-specific variables that help explaining the pace of 
13:428:33861:20:21:56:543:609:144:Times:144:Times:privatization  and  liberalization  reforms.  The  Political  Orientation  Index  measures  government’s  
13:429:33967:21:21:56:542:588:144:Times:144:Times:political preferences in the right-left political spectrum. As shown by Bortolotti and Faccio (2009), 
13:430:34069:21:20:56:544:567:144:Times:144:Times:Potrafke  (2010)  and  Duso  and  Seldeslachts  (2010),  the  political  orientation  of  the  executive  in  
13:431:34179:20:21:56:543:547:144:Times:144:Times:charge  is  a  significant  determinant  of  structural  reforms  such  as  market  liberalization  and  firm  
13:432:34290:21:21:56:542:526:144:Times:144:Times:privatization.  The index we use ranges from 0 (extreme left wing) to 10 (extreme right wing) and is 
13:433:34391:21:20:56:545:505:144:Times:144:Times:the  weighted  average  of  the  right-left  political  orientation  scores  of  the  parties  forming  the  
13:434:34500:20:21:56:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:executive branch of government, where the weights are equal to the number of parliamentary seats 
13:435:34597:21:21:56:541:464:144:Times:144:Times:held by each party divided by the total number of parliamentary seats held by the ruling coalition as 
13:436:34699:21:21:56:541:443:144:Times:144:Times:a whole (see Huber and Inglehart, 1995, updated by Bortolotti and Pinotti, 2008). The Debt to GDP 
13:437:34797:21:20:56:541:422:144:Times:144:Times:ratio is the ratio of total government debt (domestic and foreign) to GDP in a given year (our source 
13:438:34899:20:21:56:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:here is the OECD Structural Analysis Database). Bortolotti and Faccio (2009) include this ratio to 
13:439:34998:21:21:56:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:control  for  one  country’s  fiscal  conditions,  as  large  debt  to  GDP  ratios  spurred  the  privatization  
13:440:35112:21:20:56:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:wave  in  many  EU  member  states  struggling  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Maastricht  
13:441:35218:20:21:56:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:Treaty. Finally, to account for changes in the market structure  within public utility sectors, we use 
13:442:35321:21:21:56:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:the OECD  Index  of  Liberalization, sourced  from  the  OECD  International  Regulation  database  by  
13:443:35424:21:20:56:543:298:144:Times:144:Times:Conway  and  Nicoletti  (2006).  The  index  is  an  average  of  several  indicators  varying  from  0  to  6  
13:444:35536:20:21:56:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:(larger  numbers  indicate  a  lower  degree  of  openness)  and  accounts  for  entry  barriers,  vertical  
13:445:35645:21:21:56:543:257:144:Times:144:Times:integration  and  other  features  of  the  industry  structure.  Because  the  original  index  also  includes  a  
13:446:35761:21:21:56:541:236:144:Times:144:Times:sub-indicator for state ownership of the relevant firms, we excluded this component and recomputed 
13:447:35860:21:44:56:320:215:144:Times:144:Times:the average over the remaining OECD sub-indicators.  
13:448:35913:44:33:92:238:171:144:Times:144:Times: 4. The Sample and the Data 
13:449:35941:33:21:92:543:138:144:Times:144:Times:For  the  empirical  analysis  we  use  an  unbalanced  panel  of  88  publicly  traded  utilities  and  
13:450:36046:21:20:56:542:117:144:Times:144:Times:transportation infrastructure operators from EU 15 member states, tracked from 1994 to 2005.  All 
13:451:36144:20:21:56:543:97:144:Times:144:Times:firms  operate  in  regulated  sectors,  i.e.  where  entry  and  prices  are  subject  to  regulatory  oversight  
13:452:36259:21:0:56:543:76:144:Times:144:Times:either  by  the  State  through  ministries,  governmental  committees,  or  local  governments  or  by  a  
14:453:36369:0:21:56:544:760:144:Times:144:Times:formally  Independent  Regulatory  Agency  (IRA),  and  many,  though  publicly  traded  on  a  stock  
14:454:36472:21:21:56:541:739:144:Times:144:Times:exchange, are partially owned by the government. The regulated sectors include electric and natural 
14:455:36572:21:21:56:541:718:144:Times:144:Times:gas utilities (in both distribution and transmission), water supply companies, fixed telecoms, freight 
14:456:36675:21:20:56:542:697:144:Times:144:Times:roads concessionaires, and transport infrastructure operators such as ports, airports authorities, and 
14:457:36778:20:27:56:149:677:144:Times:144:Times:rail infrastructure.  
14:458:36800:27:21:92:541:650:144:Times:144:Times:The data comprise a diversified set of firms operating in a wide array of industries that either 
14:459:36897:21:20:56:543:629:144:Times:144:Times:were  always  under  an  IRA  (such  as  UK  energy,  telecom  and  water  companies),  or  never  were  
14:460:37002:20:21:56:542:609:144:Times:144:Times:subject to an IRA (freight roads concessionaries, ports and docks, airports and water companies in 
14:461:37101:21:21:56:542:588:144:Times:144:Times:all Europe except UK), or that become regulated by an IRA within the sample period. Although in 
14:462:37197:21:20:56:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:the  empirical  analysis  we  control  for  this  heterogeneity  by  including  firm  fixed  effects,  one  might  
14:463:37312:20:21:56:543:547:144:Times:144:Times:worry  that  the  different  institutional  and  regulatory  environment  faced  by  the  firms  (Independent  
14:464:37423:21:21:56:543:526:144:Times:144:Times:Authority,  national  ministries,  local  governments  or  some  executive  branch  commission)  might  
14:465:37527:21:20:56:542:505:144:Times:144:Times:somehow bias our results. To address this concern, we conduct the econometric analysis both on the 
14:466:37626:20:21:56:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:larger,  more  heterogeneous  sample  and  on  the  sub-sample  of  energy  (electricity  and  gas)  utilities  
14:467:37738:21:21:56:542:464:144:Times:144:Times:and telecom companies EU telecoms and energy (electricity and gas) utilities eventually subject to 
14:468:37837:21:21:56:543:443:144:Times:144:Times:IRA  and  to  similar  EU-prompted  market  reforms.  This  sub-sample  comprises  57  firms  -  15  fixed  
14:469:37945:21:20:56:273:422:144:Times:144:Times:telecom operators and 42 energy companies. 
14:470:37988:20:21:92:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:To  measure  regulatory  independence,  we  use  a  dummy  that  is  equal  to  1  in  all  years  in  
14:471:38091:21:21:56:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:which  the  firm  was  subject  to  an  IRA  and  equals  0  otherwise  (i.e.  when  it  is  regulated  by  an  
14:472:38203:21:20:56:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:executive-branch  commission).  The  IRA  dummy  was  constructed  using  data  and  information  on  
14:473:38305:20:21:56:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:IRAs’  inception  dates  taken  from  Gilardi  (2005)  for energy and telecommunications. As shown in 
14:474:38407:21:21:56:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:Table  1,  the  U.K.  introduced  an  IRA  in  1984  in  the  telecom  industry  and  in  1989  in  the  energy  
14:475:38520:21:20:56:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:sector, while most countries established an IRA only in mid nineties, most of them in the time span 
14:476:38620:20:21:56:542:278:144:Times:144:Times:between 1995 and 2000. We complemented this data by drawing information about the presence of 
14:477:38714:21:21:56:541:257:144:Times:144:Times:IRAs in the other sectors from additional sources and found that only the water industry in the UK 
14:478:38813:21:21:56:542:236:144:Times:144:Times:has an independent regulatory agency. Overall, 60 firms (the 57 energy and telecom operators plus 
14:479:38911:21:20:56:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:three UK water supply companies) are (or become) subject to an IRA while  28  are  regulated  by  a  
14:480:39012:20:27:56:252:195:144:Times:144:Times:governmental committee or a ministry.   
14:481:39052:27:21:92:541:168:144:Times:144:Times:For all firms, we identify and track overtime the state’s ultimate control rights (Government 
14:482:39146:21:20:56:542:147:144:Times:144:Times:UCR) following to the weakest link approach. According to this approach, the UCR of the state is

14:484:39342:21:24:56:542:106:144:Times:144:Times:multiple  chains,  the  UCR’s  are  summed  up  across  all  chains.12  Among  the  88  firms,  42  firms  are

14:486:39502:7:16:56:542:75:42:Times:100:Times:12  The  “weakest  link”  is  widely  used  in  the  literature  to  measure  control  rights.  See  La  Porta,  Lopez-de-Silanes,  and  
14:487:39639:16:0:56:517:59:100:Times:100:Times:Shleifer (1999), Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000), Faccio and Lang (2002), and Bortolotti and Faccio (2009).

15:489:39862:21:21:56:543:739:144:Times:144:Times:period,  and  20  were  “privatized”  during  our  sample  period  (i.e.  when  the  state’s  ultimate  control  
15:490:39975:21:21:56:543:718:144:Times:144:Times:rights  fall  below  30%  during  our  sample  period).  As  Figure  2  shows,  privatized  utilities  often  
15:491:40085:21:20:56:541:697:144:Times:144:Times:display complex ownership structures, with pyramiding often used to separate share ownership and 
15:492:40182:20:21:56:542:677:144:Times:144:Times:control. A first examination of our data reveals that the State has a stake in sixty-two companies and 
15:493:40285:21:21:56:543:656:144:Times:144:Times:that  thirty-seven  of  the  partially  State-controlled  utilities  are  subject  to  an  IRA.  In  Table  2,  we  
15:494:40401:21:20:56:543:635:144:Times:144:Times:report,  for  the  ten  largest  utilities  in  the  telecom  and  energy  sectors,  the  year  since  when  they  
15:495:40516:20:21:56:541:615:144:Times:144:Times:operate under an IRA, the date of the IPO, the total market capitalization and the Government UCR 
15:496:40613:21:21:56:544:594:144:Times:144:Times:at  the  end  of  the  sample  period  (2005).  Compared  to  telecommunications,  energy  IRAs  were  
15:497:40716:21:20:56:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:introduced later, mostly around 2000. The privatization process also differs across countries: it lags 
15:498:40819:20:21:56:542:553:144:Times:144:Times:behind in France and Germany, but is more advanced in Spain and in the U.K. where most sample 
15:499:40913:21:21:56:542:532:144:Times:144:Times:firms are under private control during the sample period.  More in detail, we note that 4 out of 14 
15:500:41013:21:20:56:541:511:144:Times:144:Times:fixed telecom operators were fully privatized by 2005 whereas two, in Germany and Sweden, were 
15:501:41108:20:21:56:544:491:144:Times:144:Times:still  controlled  by  the  State  with  a  stake  larger  than  50%.  Among  energy  operators,  the  UK  
15:502:41215:21:21:56:544:470:144:Times:144:Times:companies  are  fully  privatized,  E.ON  (Germany)  and  Iberdola  (Spain)  have  government  UCR  
15:503:41315:21:21:56:541:449:144:Times:144:Times:below 5%, while the two France operators are still owned by the state with a share larger than 80% 
15:504:41414:21:26:56:123:428:144:Times:144:Times:(as of 2005).  
15:505:41429:26:21:92:544:402:144:Times:144:Times:Accounting  and  financial  firm-level  data  have  been  collected  from  Worldscope.  As  a  
15:506:41524:21:21:56:542:381:144:Times:144:Times:measure  of  firm  value,  we  use  the  market-to-book  ratio  (MTB). MTB  is  calculated  as  total  assets  
15:507:41635:21:20:56:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:minus  the  book  value  of  equity  plus  the  market  value  of  equity  divided  by  the  total  assets.  The  
15:508:41749:20:21:56:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:market value of equity is computed by multiplying the number of outstanding shares at the end of 
15:509:41846:21:21:56:542:319:144:Times:144:Times:the relevant year by the share price at that date converted into U.S. dollars. Other key variables for 
15:510:41949:21:20:56:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:the  analysis  of  market-to-book ratios are the log of real total assets  to  control  for  size, the ratio of 
15:511:42061:20:21:56:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:EBIT  (earnings  before  interests  and  taxes)  to  total  assets,  which  is  a  proxy  for  profitability  and  
15:512:42176:21:21:56:541:257:144:Times:144:Times:“efficiency”, and firm financial leverage, defined as total financial debt divided by the sum of book 
15:513:42278:21:27:56:208:236:144:Times:144:Times:equity and total financial debt.  
15:514:42312:27:20:92:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  control  for  key  features  of  the  financial  and  macroeconomic  environment  of  the  
15:515:42413:20:21:56:543:189:144:Times:144:Times:different  EU  countries.  We  use  the  Investor  Protection  index,  i.e.  the  “anti-director  rights”  index  
15:516:42527:21:21:56:542:168:144:Times:144:Times:developed by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1999) and updated by Pagano and 
15:517:42621:21:20:56:541:147:144:Times:144:Times:Volpin (2005) to proxy for the extent of protection and enforcement of investor rights. The index is 
15:518:42722:20:21:56:542:127:144:Times:144:Times:time  varying  and  goes  from  0  to  7  as  shareholders’ rights become more protected. We expect that 
15:519:42827:21:21:56:542:106:144:Times:144:Times:higher values of this index are associated with lower cost of equity and hence higher market value 
15:520:42926:21:20:56:541:85:144:Times:144:Times:(see, for example, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny, 2002). Finally, we include GDP 
15:521:43025:20:0:56:542:65:144:Times:144:Times:Growth to account for country specific differences in macroeconomic conditions over time. Table 3 
16:522:43125:0:21:56:543:760:144:Times:144:Times:summarizes  the  descriptive  statistics  for  the  main  firm  and  country  level  variables  used  in  the  
16:523:43236:21:21:56:541:739:144:Times:144:Times:analysis both for the full sample (Panel A) and for the sub-sample of energy and telecom companies 
16:524:43335:21:27:56:108:718:144:Times:144:Times:(Panel B). 
16:525:43346:27:20:92:542:691:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 1 shows the average market-to-book ratios for private and state controlled firms from 
16:526:43439:20:21:56:543:671:144:Times:144:Times:3  years  before  the  IRA  set  up  to  3  years  after  the  IRA  establishment,  using  the  57  energy  and  
16:527:43552:21:21:56:542:650:144:Times:144:Times:telecom firms. If we define as state-controlled those companies where Government UCR are equal 
16:528:43647:21:20:56:542:629:144:Times:144:Times:to or greater than 30%, we notice that the average market to book ratio of state controlled firms is 
16:529:43748:20:21:56:542:609:144:Times:144:Times:lower before the switch (year 0), but thereafter starts growing and, in the second and third year after 
16:530:43852:21:21:56:541:588:144:Times:144:Times:the IRA setup, is definitively larger: +20% and + 15%, respectively. In contrast, the average MTB 
16:531:43949:21:45:56:489:567:144:Times:144:Times:of private companies decreased from 1.33, at the regime switch, to 1.22 three years later.

16:566:45296:7:16:56:543:121:42:Times:100:Times:13  A  similar  approach  was  used  by  Kwoka  (2002  and  2006)  to  assess  the  differences  across  private  and  public  
16:567:45423:16:7:56:395:105:100:Times:100:Times:ownership in the prices charged by U.S. electric utilities and in their cost efficiency. 
16:568:45512:7:16:56:541:98:42:Times:100:Times:14 This specification is rather standard in the literature (see, for example, Morck, Shleifer and Vishny, 1988; McConnell 
16:569:45634:16:12:56:542:82:100:Times:100:Times:and  Servaes,  1990;  Lang,  Ofek  and  Stulz,  1996).  The  reason  for  not  using  market  leverage  is  to  avoid  the  spurious  
16:570:45768:12:11:56:541:70:100:Times:100:Times:correlation resulting from the fact that the market value of equity appears both in the numerator of Market-to-Book and 
16:571:45888:11:0:56:217:59:100:Times:100:Times:in the denominator of market leverage.  
17:572:45930:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:partly address potential reverse causality, we lag all firm variables one year and moreover we add 
17:573:46029:21:27:56:517:739:144:Times:144:Times:firm-specific fixed effects to filter out unobserved firm heterogeneity that is constant over time. 
17:574:46129:27:21:92:543:712:144:Times:144:Times:In  Table  4,  we  present  the  O.L.S.  fixed  effect  coefficients  for  the  EU  regulated  utilities  
17:575:46235:21:20:56:544:691:144:Times:144:Times:(columns  (1)  and  (2))  and  for  the  sub-sample  of  57  regulated  energy  and  telecom  firms  that,  
17:576:46343:20:21:56:543:671:144:Times:144:Times:following  the  EC  directives,  at  some  point  in  time  -  mostly  from  1996  to  2000  -  implemented  the  
17:577:46457:21:21:56:541:650:144:Times:144:Times:new regulatory regime. In Columns (3) and (4), we thus focus on the changes in the market value of 
17:578:46556:21:26:56:352:629:144:Times:144:Times:private vs. public firms after they became subject to an IRA.  
17:579:46619:26:21:92:542:603:144:Times:144:Times:The  results  show  that  the  market  to  book  ratio  is  negatively  related  to  firm  size  and  that  
17:580:46727:21:21:56:543:582:144:Times:144:Times:market  value  is  larger  in  countries  where  investor  rights  are  better  protected  by  the  law  and  GDP  
17:581:46842:21:20:56:543:561:144:Times:144:Times:growth  is  faster.  In  Column  (1),  we  find  that  neither  state  ownership  nor  the  IRA  dummy  has,  
17:582:46952:20:21:56:544:541:144:Times:144:Times:separately, a significant effect. Column (2) adds the interaction between Government UCR and IRA.  
17:583:47050:21:21:56:542:520:144:Times:144:Times:We find that the coefficient on Government UCR turns significantly negative, while its interaction 
17:584:47149:21:20:56:542:499:144:Times:144:Times:with IRA is positive and highly significant. The positive coefficient on the interacted terms suggests 
17:585:47252:20:21:56:542:479:144:Times:144:Times:that  when  the  IRA  is  in  place,  the  larger  the  share  held  by  the  State,  the  higher  the  firm  market  
17:586:47370:21:21:56:544:458:144:Times:144:Times:value.  In  Columns  (3)  and  (4),  the  results  for  the  control  variables  are  less  precisely  estimated,  
17:587:47485:21:21:56:543:437:144:Times:144:Times:probably  due  to  the  exclusion  of  firms  that  either  had  the  IRA  from  the  start  or  never  became  
17:588:47597:21:20:56:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:subject  to  an  IRA,  which  sort  of  reduced  the  heterogeneity  in  the  data.  Notwithstanding  this,  in  
17:589:47710:20:21:56:543:396:144:Times:144:Times:Column  (3)  we  find  that  the  coefficient  on  GovernmentUCR  is  positive  and  significant  and,  in  
17:590:47818:21:21:56:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:Column  (4),  when  we  consider  the  effect  of  public  ownership  under  the  IRA,  the  standalone  
17:591:47923:21:20:56:545:354:144:Times:144:Times:GovernmentUCR variable  is  no  longer  significant  while  the  interaction  term  is  positive  and  
17:592:48026:20:27:56:453:334:144:Times:144:Times:significant. This latter result is consistent with the graphical evidence in Figure 1.  
17:593:48114:27:21:92:542:307:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  next  section,  we  interpret  this  finding,  analyzing  its  political  economy  implications.  
17:594:48221:21:20:56:541:286:144:Times:144:Times:For this analysis, we focus on the sub-sample of firms operating in the energy and telecom  sectors 
17:595:48321:20:45:56:508:266:144:Times:144:Times:where IRAs have been established. We report the results for the full sample in the Appendix.  
17:596:48415:45:33:92:448:221:144:Times:144:Times:6. Firm Value and State Ownership: the Role of Political Institutions  
17:597:48486:33:21:92:543:188:144:Times:144:Times:Our  next  step  is  to  examine  the  driving  forces  that  may  explain  the  positive  impact  of  
17:598:48589:21:20:56:541:167:144:Times:144:Times:residual state ownership on firm value when the IRA exists.  In Section 3, we argued that the quality 
17:599:48691:20:21:56:543:147:144:Times:144:Times:of  a  country’s  political  institutions  disciplines  the  discretionary  power  of  the  government  and  its  
17:600:48805:21:21:56:542:126:144:Times:144:Times:latitude to interfere with the regulatory policy. To implement an empirical test we first investigate 
17:601:48907:21:20:56:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:whether  the  response  of  firm  value  to  different  regulatory  and  ownership  regimes  differs  across  
17:602:49017:20:21:56:542:85:144:Times:144:Times:“weak” vs. “strong” political institutions as measured by two country-specific indices: Checks and 
17:603:49116:21:0:56:541:64:144:Times:144:Times:Balances and Electoral Disproportionality (Section 6.1). We then address the potential endogeneity 
18:604:49217:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:of Government UCR, IRA and of their interaction by incorporating the role of political institutions 
18:605:49317:21:21:56:541:739:144:Times:144:Times:straight into a specific identifying assumption, i.e. that Checks and Balances and Disproportionality 
18:606:49418:21:21:56:542:718:144:Times:144:Times:are  valid  instruments  in  a  regression  of  partially  privatized  regulated  firms’  market-to-book  ratio  
18:607:49531:21:38:56:124:697:144:Times:144:Times:(Section 6.2). 
18:608:49546:38:33:92:454:659:144:Times:144:Times:6.1 Weak vs. Strong Political Institutions: Evidence from Sub-samples 
18:609:49616:33:21:92:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:We estimate market value regressions where we split our sample energy and telecom firms 
18:610:49704:21:20:56:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:based on Checks and Balances (C&B) in Table 5, and Electoral Disproportionality in Table 6. The 
18:611:49800:20:21:56:542:585:144:Times:144:Times:indexes allow for institutional changes over time as well as firms shifting across the “high”-“low” 
18:612:49900:21:21:56:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:categories.    To  classify  country-years  observations  with  the  strongest  countervailing  powers,  we  
18:613:50009:21:20:56:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:refer  to  values  of  the  C&B  index  at  the  top  quartile  of  its  distribution  –  more  specifically,  when  
18:614:50126:20:21:56:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:C&B  is  greater  than  4  (and  symmetrically,  for  observations  with  C&B  less  than  or  equal  to  4).  
18:615:50237:21:21:56:541:502:144:Times:144:Times:Based on country averages, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Germany exhibit the highest scoresand 
18:616:50332:21:20:56:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy the lowest. Figure 3 reports the trends of the political institutions 
18:617:50436:20:21:56:544:461:144:Times:144:Times:indexes  for  two  selected  countries  at  the  top  and  at  the  bottom  ends  of  the  distributions,  i.e.  
18:618:50549:21:27:56:323:440:144:Times:144:Times:Denmark and Germany, Spain and Italy, respectively.   
18:619:50603:27:21:92:543:413:144:Times:144:Times:The  empirical  results  in  Table  5  are  consistent  with  our  predictions.    In  countries  where  
18:620:50708:21:20:56:542:392:144:Times:144:Times:institutional  checks  and  balances  are  weaker,  larger  government’s  ownership  stakes  lead  to  higher  
18:621:50819:20:21:56:541:372:144:Times:144:Times:MTB ratios for the regulated firms. The evidence is weaker in Column (1) where we do not account 
18:622:50916:21:21:56:542:351:144:Times:144:Times:for the presence of the IRA, but is very strong where we do, in Column (2). The results strikingly 
18:623:51015:21:20:56:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:differ  when  we  turn  to  Columns  (3)  and  (4),  where  the  countervailing  powers  are  supposed  to  
18:624:51123:20:21:56:542:310:144:Times:144:Times:restrain interference from the executive more efficiently. In both specifications, the IRA dummy is 
18:625:51223:21:21:56:544:289:144:Times:144:Times:positive  and  significant  which  suggests  that  where  IRAs  are  expected  to  act  independently  (as  
18:626:51331:21:20:56:544:268:144:Times:144:Times:envisioned  by  the  EC  directives),  capital  markets  assign  a  premium  to  the  reduced  regulatory  
18:627:51438:20:21:56:543:248:144:Times:144:Times:uncertainty  that  follows  regulatory  commitment  (see  Cambini  and  Rondi,  2011,  for  evidence  on  
18:628:51544:21:21:56:541:227:144:Times:144:Times:fixed investment). Moreover, in Column (4), the interaction between GovernmentUCR and the IRA 
18:629:51637:21:21:56:543:206:144:Times:144:Times:dummy  is  negatively  correlated  with  firm  value,  and  this  is  consistent  with  the  typical  negative  
18:630:51749:21:26:56:323:185:144:Times:144:Times:outlook assigned to state-controlled regulated utilities.  
18:631:51808:26:21:92:545:159:144:Times:144:Times:To classify country-years observations where policy reversals are supposed to be less likely  
18:632:51902:21:21:56:543:138:144:Times:144:Times:owing  to  the  electoral  system,  we  refer  to  low  values  of  the  Electoral  Disproportionality  index.  
18:633:52014:21:0:56:545:117:144:Times:144:Times:Recall  that  low  values  of  the  index  indicate  highly  fragmented  political  systems  and  divided  
19:634:52123:0:21:56:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:governments,  which  according  to  Levy  and  Spiller  (1994)15,  favor  regulatory  commitment  while,  
19:635:52229:21:21:56:542:739:144:Times:144:Times:incontrast, more cohesive governments typical of majoritarian systems have more room to interfere 
19:636:52327:21:21:56:546:718:144:Times:144:Times:in  regulatory  decisions.  Indeed,  we  notice  that,  on  average,  Electoral  Disproportionality  is  
19:637:52432:21:20:56:542:697:144:Times:144:Times:negatively  correlated  with  C&Bs,  suggesting  that  checks  and  balances  tend  to  be  less  effective  in  
19:638:52545:20:21:56:542:677:144:Times:144:Times:majoritarian systems. Again using country averages, we find that Denmark, Holland, Germany and 
19:639:52640:21:21:56:544:656:144:Times:144:Times:Sweden  score  lower  Disproportionality  Indexes,  while,  at  the  opposite  end  of  the  distribution,  
19:640:52748:21:20:56:541:635:144:Times:144:Times:France (the most majoritarian system), the UK, Greece and Italy score the higher indexes. In Figure 
19:641:52848:20:21:56:544:615:144:Times:144:Times:3,  we  plot  the  evolution  of  both  Checks  and  Balances  and  Disproportionality  for  a  subset  of  
19:642:52956:21:27:56:109:594:144:Times:144:Times:countries.  
19:643:52968:27:20:92:542:567:144:Times:144:Times:In Table 6, we report the results of the MTB equation when the sample is split according to 
19:644:53060:20:21:56:542:547:144:Times:144:Times:the electoral rule.  To allow straightforward comparability with the results in Table 5, we inverted 
19:645:53161:21:21:56:541:526:144:Times:144:Times:the Disproportionality  index  to  generate  an  Electoral  Proportionality  (EP)  index  so  that  high 
19:646:53265:21:20:56:542:505:144:Times:144:Times:proportionality has, by construction, an effect similar to high checks and balances. To separate the 
19:647:53366:20:21:56:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:sample, we thus use a threshold value of Electoral Proportionality of 28.5 to split the sample (i.e. 
19:648:53467:21:21:56:542:464:144:Times:144:Times:the 75th percentile value of the distribution of the inverted Disproportionality index). The results in 
19:649:53571:21:21:56:543:443:144:Times:144:Times:Table  6  show  that,  as  the  electoral  rule  becomes  less  proportional  (hence  in  countries  with  more  
19:650:53684:21:20:56:543:422:144:Times:144:Times:majoritarian  parliamentary  systems),  the  larger  the  stake  held  by  the  state,  the  higher  the  firm  
19:651:53796:20:21:56:542:402:144:Times:144:Times:market value, particularly if the IRA is in place as shown by the positive and statistically significant 
19:652:53901:21:21:56:542:381:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on the GovernmentUCR*IRA  interaction  in  Column  (2).  In  contrast,  when  we  focus  on  
19:653:54006:21:20:56:541:360:144:Times:144:Times:the sub-sample with more fragmented parliamentary systems, residual state ownership of regulated 
19:654:54103:20:27:56:277:340:144:Times:144:Times:firms is irrelevant (see Columns (3) and (4)).  
19:655:54151:27:21:92:543:313:144:Times:144:Times:Our  results  in  Tables  5  and  6  suggest  that  the  exploitation  of  political  leverage  to  obtain  
19:656:54259:21:20:56:545:292:144:Times:144:Times:higher  value  (through  political  interference  in  regulatory  decisions)  does  not  occur  whenever  
19:657:54365:20:21:56:545:272:144:Times:144:Times:regulation  is  granted  independence  by  countervailing  powers  constraining  the  power  of  the  
19:658:54467:21:21:56:542:251:144:Times:144:Times:executive. In this case, regulatory policy is enforced independently of government residual stakes in 
19:659:54569:21:27:56:99:230:144:Times:144:Times:firms.16  
19:660:54579:27:26:92:95:203:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:661:54579:26:49:92:95:177:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:662:54579:49:7:56:203:128:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
19:663:54627:7:16:56:521:121:42:Times:100:Times:15 Spiller and Urbiztondo (1994) also show that the probability of observing more independent agencies is higher in 
19:664:54743:16:7:56:248:105:100:Times:100:Times:systems characterized by divided governments. 
19:665:54789:7:16:56:543:98:42:Times:100:Times:16  In  the  Appendix,  we  apply  the  same  sub-sampling  strategy  to  the  full  sample  (i.e.  including  also  firms  in  utility  
19:666:54926:16:12:56:540:82:100:Times:100:Times:sectors regulated not by an independent authority, but by a branch of the government such as ministries or governmental 
19:667:55046:12:11:56:540:70:100:Times:100:Times:committees). We find that the results are very similar: under low checks and balances systems and less fragmented party 
19:668:55166:11:0:56:316:59:100:Times:100:Times:systems, a larger governments stake leads to higher firm value.   
20:669:55234:0:32:92:262:759:144:Times:144:Times:6.2 Instrumental variable results 
20:670:55268:32:21:92:543:727:144:Times:144:Times:The  results  reported  in  the  previous  section  support  the  idea  of  reluctant  regulation  as  a  
20:671:55374:21:21:56:543:706:144:Times:144:Times:possible  factor  explaining  why  state  ownership  benefits  public  utilities.  We  now  try  to  find  more  
20:672:55487:21:20:56:545:685:144:Times:144:Times:systematic  evidence  from  instrumental  variable  estimation.  In  Section  3  we  argued  that  state  
20:673:55593:20:21:56:542:665:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  could  affect  its  market  value  only  when  weak  political  institutions  allow  government’s  
20:674:55703:21:21:56:543:644:144:Times:144:Times:interference  through  reluctant  regulation.    To  test  this  prediction,  we  now  estimate  the  effect  of  
20:675:55817:21:20:56:541:623:144:Times:144:Times:political  institutions  by  two-stage  least  squares  (2SLS),  using  Checks  and  Balances,  or  Electoral 
20:676:55927:20:21:56:543:603:144:Times:144:Times:Proportionality,  and  other  country-specific  variables  (political  orientation,  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio,  
20:677:56040:21:21:56:541:582:144:Times:144:Times:and market openness) as instruments for Government UCR, IRA and their interaction (Government 
20:678:56134:21:20:56:542:561:144:Times:144:Times:UCR*IRA).  Because we have more instruments than endogenous variables, our statistical model is 
20:679:56230:20:21:56:543:541:144:Times:144:Times:over-identified.  We  thus  test  the  over-identifying  restrictions  and  identify  the  impact  of  both  state  
20:680:56346:21:21:56:541:520:144:Times:144:Times:ownership and IRA on firm value by testing the exclusion restriction that Checks and Balances and 
20:681:56444:21:20:56:541:499:144:Times:144:Times:Electoral  Proportionality do not appear in the second stage estimation of  firm  market  value,  MTB 
20:682:56545:20:21:56:337:479:144:Times:144:Times:(we perform a similar test also for the other instruments).  
20:683:56606:21:21:92:543:458:144:Times:144:Times:In  Table  7.1,  we  present  the  first-stage  regressions  for  Government  UCR, IRA  and  their  
20:684:56706:21:21:56:541:437:144:Times:144:Times:interaction   when   we   use   Checks   and   Balances   (Columns   (1),   (3)   and   (5))   and   Electoral 
20:685:56817:21:20:56:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:Proportionality  (Columns  (2),  (4)  and  (6))  in  the  instrument  sets.  In  Columns  (1)  and  (2),  the  
20:686:56928:20:21:56:542:396:144:Times:144:Times:negative  coefficients  on  Political  Orientation  indicate  that  state  ownership  tends  to  be  lower  when  
20:687:57042:21:21:56:541:375:144:Times:144:Times:the executive is more ”right-wing”, while the positive coefficients on the OECD index suggest that 
20:688:57141:21:20:56:541:354:144:Times:144:Times:larger government stakes tend to be associated with less open and less liberalized markets. Columns 
20:689:57241:20:21:56:541:334:144:Times:144:Times:(3) and (4) suggest that IRAs were primarily set up when the Debt-to-GDP ratio is highest, probably 
20:690:57341:21:21:56:542:313:144:Times:144:Times:because  EU  member  states  tend  to  be  more  eager  to  comply  with  institutional  requirements  when  
20:691:57450:21:20:56:538:292:144:Times:144:Times:they are under fiscal distress. In addition, the inception of an IRA is positively associated with right-
20:692:57555:20:21:56:541:272:144:Times:144:Times:wing governments, market openness, and electoral proportionality, and negatively related to checks 
20:693:57654:21:21:56:543:251:144:Times:144:Times:and  balances  (but  recall  that  the  IRAs  were  setup  following  EU  Directives,  so  these  results  may  
20:694:57766:21:21:56:544:230:144:Times:144:Times:reflect  the  timing  of  the  implementation  of  the  norm).  More  importantly  for  our  point  of  view,  
20:695:57877:21:20:56:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:Columns (5) and (6) show that, when the IRA is in place, residual state ownership tend to be larger 
20:696:57977:20:21:56:542:189:144:Times:144:Times:where the institutional checks and balances are weaker and electoral proportionality is lower. This 
20:697:58077:21:21:56:544:168:144:Times:144:Times:evidence  is  consistent  with  the  idea  that  strong,  less  accountable  executives  do  not  wish  to  
20:698:58185:21:20:56:543:147:144:Times:144:Times:relinquish  control  over  politically  sensitive  public  utilities  from  which  they  can  extract  economic  
20:699:58298:20:21:56:542:127:144:Times:144:Times:rents.  Overall the first-stage results deliver an important message: of all the instruments we used, 
20:700:58400:21:21:56:544:106:144:Times:144:Times:only Checks  and  Balances  and  Electoral  Proportionality  are  significant  determinants  of  all  the  
20:701:58507:21:20:56:542:85:144:Times:144:Times:endogenous variables. More to the point, they are the only significant explanatory variables of the 
20:702:58607:20:0:56:518:65:144:Times:144:Times:interaction term that capture the residual state ownership under the IRA (Columns (5) and (6)).  
21:703:58706:0:21:92:542:760:144:Times:144:Times:In Table 7.2, we present the 2SLS results where we test the over-identifying restrictions by 
21:704:58799:21:21:56:541:739:144:Times:144:Times:calculating the Sargan-Hansen and the Difference in Sargan statistics as well as by including C&B 
21:705:58896:21:21:56:292:718:144:Times:144:Times:and EP directly in the second-stage regressions.  
21:706:58946:21:20:92:542:697:144:Times:144:Times:Columns (1) and (3) report the 2SLS estimates when we use, respectively, C&B and EP in 
21:707:59033:20:21:56:544:677:144:Times:144:Times:the  instrument  set,  along  with  political  orientation,  debt  to  GDP  ratio  and  the  OECD  market  
21:708:59140:21:21:56:543:656:144:Times:144:Times:liberalization  index.  The  results  show  that  the  interaction  Government  UCR*IRA  is  positive  and  
21:709:59248:21:20:56:542:635:144:Times:144:Times:significant in all columns, which supports our hypothesis that the presence of the government as a 
21:710:59347:20:21:56:542:615:144:Times:144:Times:(residual)  shareholder  boosts  the  regulated  firm’s  value  providing  a  sort  of  indirect  governmental  
21:711:59459:21:21:56:435:594:144:Times:144:Times:protection that is apparently recognized and rewarded by the capital markets.   
21:712:59539:21:20:92:542:573:144:Times:144:Times:Comfortingly, the J statistics shows that the sets of instruments we use in both specifications 
21:713:59635:20:21:56:542:553:144:Times:144:Times:are  valid  and  the  Difference  in  Sargan  tests  on  the  political  institution  variables  confirm  that  they  
21:714:59753:21:21:56:541:532:144:Times:144:Times:are valid instruments.  However, we further test the exclusion restrictions by entering C&B and EP 
21:715:59852:21:20:56:542:511:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  second  stage,  in  Columns  (2)  and  (4)  respectively.  The  results  confirm  the  validity  of  our  
21:716:59967:20:21:56:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:identification  strategy,  as  both  instruments,  once  included  in  the  MTB  regression,  are  statistically  
21:717:60081:21:21:56:542:470:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant.17 This analysis shows that (weak) political institutions affect firms’ market value, but 
21:718:60185:21:21:56:543:449:144:Times:144:Times:only  through  the  effect  of  residual  government  stakes  in  regulated  firms.  We  set  forth  reluctant  
21:719:60297:21:20:56:541:428:144:Times:144:Times:regulation as an important channel to explain the valuation effect of government’s shareholdings in 
21:720:60397:20:45:56:134:408:144:Times:144:Times:public utilities.  
21:721:60416:45:33:92:198:363:144:Times:144:Times:7. Robustness Tests  
21:722:60437:33:20:92:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:As  noted  in  Section  2,  from  a  country  level  perspective,  the  UK  is  the  EU  member  state  
21:723:60541:20:21:56:547:310:144:Times:144:Times:where   the   institutional   reforms   started   earlier.   More   precisely,   independent   regulators   in   
21:724:60654:21:21:56:542:289:144:Times:144:Times:telecommunications, energy and water supply were set up in the Eighties and most firms were fully 
21:725:60752:21:20:56:542:268:144:Times:144:Times:privatized even before. The peculiarity and relevance of the UK suggest us to check the robustness 
21:726:60851:20:21:56:543:248:144:Times:144:Times:of  our  results  on  a  sample  that  excludes  UK  firms.  In  Table  8  we  re-estimate  the  model  with  the  
21:727:60966:21:21:56:542:227:144:Times:144:Times:interaction between Government  UCR and IRA for the full sample of non-UK firms as well as for 
21:728:61061:21:21:56:542:206:144:Times:144:Times:the  sub-samples  with  low  C&B  and  Electoral  Proportionality.    Comfortingly,  the  results  support  
21:729:61169:21:20:56:541:185:144:Times:144:Times:our predictions and are very similar to those reported in Tables 5-7 and even sharper. In columns (1) 
21:730:61271:20:21:56:541:165:144:Times:144:Times:and (2), both the OLS and the 2SLS estimated coefficients on the Government UCR*IRA interacted 
21:731:61366:21:21:56:542:144:144:Times:144:Times:variable  are  positive  and  highly  significant.  Moreover,  the  positive  coefficients  are  significant  and  
21:732:61481:21:20:56:542:123:144:Times:144:Times:larger in the market value regressions for the firm-year observations subject to weaker checks and 
21:733:61580:20:21:56:544:103:144:Times:144:Times:balances  and  less  proportional  party  systems.  This  analysis  confirms  that  our  results  were  not  
21:734:61689:21:7:56:203:82:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
21:735:61737:7:16:56:541:75:42:Times:100:Times:17 We perform similar tests on the other instruments, by including them, one at the time, in the second stage regressions. 
21:736:61860:16:0:56:435:59:100:Times:100:Times:We found that none of them were statistically significant. Results are available upon request.   
22:737:61959:0:21:56:543:760:144:Times:144:Times:sensitive  to  the  presence  (or  the  absence)  of  a  country,  such  as  the  UK  where  privatization  and  
22:738:62072:21:27:56:290:739:144:Times:144:Times:liberalization reforms date back to the Eighties.  
22:739:62123:27:21:92:545:712:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  second  robustness  check,  we  replace  the  continuous  ownership  variable  with  a  
22:740:62220:21:20:56:543:691:144:Times:144:Times:dummy  to  control  whether  the  results  hold  for  regulated  firms  where  the  state  maintains  a  stake  
22:741:62332:20:21:56:542:671:144:Times:144:Times:large enough to reasonably ensure relative power and discretionality in managerial decisions. So we 
22:742:62432:21:21:56:542:650:144:Times:144:Times:use a plausible threshold of state ownership, i.e. a dummy that equals 1 when the Government UCR 
22:743:62529:21:20:56:541:629:144:Times:144:Times:are equal to and greater than 30%, to account for the fact that the state as a shareholder is likely to 
22:744:62633:20:21:56:542:609:144:Times:144:Times:exercise control even when it holds less than the majority interest. Table 9 reports the results from 
22:745:62735:21:21:56:545:588:144:Times:144:Times:estimating  the  specification  with  the  interaction  between  the  IRA  dummy  and  the  ownership  
22:746:62838:21:20:56:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:dummy UCR_30%.  We  find  that  the  presence  of  the  state  as  a  shareholder  with  (at  least)  a  30%  
22:747:62948:20:21:56:544:547:144:Times:144:Times:stake  positively  and  significantly  affects  the  market  value,  but  only  when  we  control  for  the  
22:748:63057:21:21:56:542:526:144:Times:144:Times:endogeneity ownership variable and its interaction with the IRA dummy (Column (2)). The positive 
22:749:63154:21:20:56:542:505:144:Times:144:Times:effect,  however,  becomes  strongly  significant  when  we  turn  to  the  sub-sample  of  observations  in  
22:750:63264:20:21:56:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:countries with low checks and balances (in Column (3)) and less proportional electoral rules hence 
22:751:63363:21:21:56:547:464:144:Times:144:Times:more   majoritarian   government   systems   (in   Column   (4)).   Consistently   with   our   theoretical   
22:752:63473:21:21:56:544:443:144:Times:144:Times:framework,  in  such  political  environments  governments  maintain  the  latitude  to  interfere  with  
22:753:63579:21:26:56:486:422:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory decisions, and politicians may find it convenient to slow down privatizations.  
22:754:63670:26:21:92:544:396:144:Times:144:Times:Finally,  it  may  be  argued  that  our  state  controlled  companies  operate  in  sectors  where  
22:755:63771:21:21:56:545:375:144:Times:144:Times:competition  is  still  limited  and,  therefore,  that  our  results  capture  part  of  this  market  power.  
22:756:63883:21:20:56:545:354:144:Times:144:Times:According  to  an  OECD  report  by  Conway  and  Nicoletti  (2006,  p.6),  the  presence  of  public  
22:757:63986:20:21:56:542:334:144:Times:144:Times:ownership hinders competition in some sectors: "with public enterprises often enjoying soft budget 
22:758:64085:21:21:56:542:313:144:Times:144:Times:constraints and state guarantees, the playing field is not level in markets where they operate".  We 
22:759:64186:21:20:56:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:thus  use  the  OECD  index  of  product  market  regulation  to  test  the  impact  of  the  intensity  of  
22:760:64295:20:21:56:542:272:144:Times:144:Times:competition  on  firm  market  value,  following  the  same  strategy  employed  for  political  institutions.  
22:761:64407:21:21:56:541:251:144:Times:144:Times:We thus first split the sample using a threshold value of OECD Index of Liberalization to estimate the 
22:762:64509:21:21:56:541:230:144:Times:144:Times:effect of government control in industries with high (index below 0.8, i.e. the 25th percentile value 
22:763:64611:21:20:56:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:of  the  distribution  of  the  index)  and  low  (index  above  0.8)  competition.  The  results  show  that  
22:764:64722:20:21:56:543:189:144:Times:144:Times:Government  UCR*IRA  is  never  significant,  whether  markets  are  more  or  less  liberalized,  both  for  
22:765:64832:21:21:56:542:168:144:Times:144:Times:the full sample and for the telecom and energy sub-sample. Second, we check the direct impact of 
22:766:64929:21:20:56:541:147:144:Times:144:Times:competition by introducing the index as a regressor in the IV second-stage regression. We find that 
22:767:65029:20:0:56:542:127:144:Times:144:Times:the OECD  Index  of  Liberalization  is  insignificant,  while  Government  UCR*IRA  remains  positive  
23:768:65135:0:21:56:543:760:144:Times:144:Times:and  highly  significant.  In  sum,  the  positive  effect  of  government  ownership  on  regulated  firms’  
23:769:65245:21:45:56:455:739:144:Times:144:Times:market value is not driven by the intensity of market openness and liberalization.18 
23:770:65329:45:33:92:172:694:144:Times:144:Times:8. Conclusions  
23:771:65345:33:20:92:542:661:144:Times:144:Times:Over the last 20 years and around the world, regulatory competencies in network industries 
23:772:65436:20:21:56:541:641:144:Times:144:Times:have been delegated to independent agencies in order to improve market efficiency and to discipline 
23:773:65536:21:21:56:542:620:144:Times:144:Times:the  conflict  of  interest  stemming  from  the  dual  role  of  the  state  as  owner  and  regulator.  However,  
23:774:65652:21:20:56:543:599:144:Times:144:Times:despite  significant  efforts  and  structural  reforms,  most  utilities,  in  Europe  and  elsewhere,  are  still  
23:775:65769:20:21:56:542:579:144:Times:144:Times:owned and often controlled by the state. Consequently, regulatory independence and residual state 
23:776:65867:21:21:56:543:558:144:Times:144:Times:ownership  are  intertwined  institutional  features  that  affect  firm  real  and  financial  decisions,  and  
23:777:65980:21:26:56:176:537:144:Times:144:Times:ultimately market value. 
23:778:66005:26:21:92:543:511:144:Times:144:Times:In  this  paper,  we  study  empirically  the  relationship  between  state  ownership  and  firms’  
23:779:66106:21:21:56:543:490:144:Times:144:Times:value  when  companies  are  subject  to  independent  regulation.  Using  a  large  sample  of  European  
23:780:66213:21:20:56:543:469:144:Times:144:Times:utilities,  we  show  state  ownership  is  positively  associated  with  firm  value  and  that  this  effect  is  
23:781:66329:20:21:56:547:449:144:Times:144:Times:strong   and   significant   in   countries   where   weak   checks   and   balances   and   lower   political   
23:782:66442:21:21:56:543:428:144:Times:144:Times:fragmentation  do  not  constrain  the  power  of  the  executive.  Hence,  where  political  institutions  are  
23:783:66555:21:21:56:541:407:144:Times:144:Times:weak, politicians imperfectly delegate powers to regulatory agencies in order to benefit state-owned 
23:784:66656:21:20:56:541:386:144:Times:144:Times:firms. We label the creation of formally but not de facto independent agencies reluctant regulation, 
23:785:66757:20:21:56:544:366:144:Times:144:Times:a  new  concept  which  allows  us  to  explain  why  governments  stakes  are  associated  with  higher  
23:786:66863:21:27:56:495:345:144:Times:144:Times:valuations, and why privatization is so often partial and incomplete in network industries.   
23:787:66957:27:20:92:543:318:144:Times:144:Times:Our  results  point  out  a  possible  regulatory  failure  in  industrial  organizations  dominated  by  
23:788:67063:20:21:56:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:state  controlled  incumbents  and  characterized  by  reluctant  regulation.  Under  these  circumstances,  
23:789:67172:21:21:56:543:277:144:Times:144:Times:the  state  apparently  enjoys  and  shares  with  private  shareholders  an  undue  economic  rent  at  the  
23:790:67282:21:20:56:544:256:144:Times:144:Times:expense  of  consumers.  Given  the  prevalence  of  state  controlled  utilities  and  the  strong  power  
23:791:67390:20:21:56:545:236:144:Times:144:Times:wielded  by  national  governments,  this  conclusion  raises  concerns  about  the  effectiveness  of  
23:792:67494:21:21:56:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:privatization  and  regulatory  policies  in  network  industries  in  Europe.  To  address  the  problem  and  
23:793:67606:21:21:56:545:194:144:Times:144:Times:therefore  to  make  the  recent  structural  reforms  on  network  industries  more  credible,  national  
23:794:67713:21:20:56:544:173:144:Times:144:Times:governments  may  push  forward  privatization  to  eliminate  the  potential  conflict  of  interest,  or  
23:795:67821:20:21:56:546:153:144:Times:144:Times:improve   regulatory   institutions   in   the   direction   of   an   enhanced   independence   and   public   
23:796:67933:21:61:56:133:132:144:Times:144:Times:accountability.
