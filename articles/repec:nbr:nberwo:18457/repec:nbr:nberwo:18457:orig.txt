2:32:1655:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:At an annual cost of roughly $7 billion nationally, remedial coursework is one of the single largest
2:33:1755:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:interventions intended to improve outcomes for underprepared college students. But like a costly medical
2:34:1859:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:treatment with non-trivial side effects, the value of remediation overall depends upon whether those
2:35:1959:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:most likely to benefit can be identified in advance. Our analysis uses administrative data and a rich
2:36:2060:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:predictive model to examine the accuracy of remedial screening tests, either instead of or in addition
2:37:2162:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:to using high school transcript data to determine remedial assignment. We find that roughly one in
2:38:2260:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:four test-takers in math and one in three test-takers in English are severely mis-assigned under current
2:39:2364:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:test-based policies, with mis-assignments to remediation much more common than mis-assignments
2:40:2458:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:to college-level coursework. We find that using high school transcript information—either instead
2:41:2555:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:of or in addition to test scores—could significantly reduce the prevalence of assignment errors. Further,
2:42:2660:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:we find that the choice of screening device has significant implications for the racial and gender composition
2:43:2770:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:of both remedial and college-level courses. Finally, we find that if institutions took account of students’
2:44:2877:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:high school performance, they could remediate substantially fewer students without lowering success
2:45:2976:14:42:72:214:406:12:Times:12:Times:rates in college-level courses.

3:65:3411:0:30:72:150:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:I. Introduction 
3:66:3426:30:28:108:527:666:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Only about half of degree-seeking college entrants will complete any type of degree or 
3:67:3513:28:27:72:532:638:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:certificate within six years.1 One of the primary explanations for college non-completion is that 
3:68:3610:27:28:72:532:611:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:many entrants, despite having graduated from high school, nonetheless lack the basic academic 
3:69:3704:28:27:72:530:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:skills required for success in college coursework (Greene & Forster, 2003; Bailey et al., 2010). 
3:70:3801:27:28:72:537:556:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As a result, most two-year colleges and many four-year colleges require incoming students to be 
3:71:3897:28:28:72:511:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screened for possible remediation, which provides basic skills instruction but does not bear 
3:72:3990:28:27:72:377:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college credit, before they may enroll in college-level courses.  
3:73:4053:27:28:108:512:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Besides financial aid, remedial education is perhaps the most widespread and costly 
3:74:4137:28:27:72:534:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:single intervention aimed at improving college completion rates. Half of all undergraduates will 
3:75:4233:27:28:72:533:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:take one or more remedial courses while enrolled; among those who take any the average is 2.6 
3:76:4327:28:28:72:543:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial courses.2 With over three million new students entering college each year, this implies a 
3:77:4425:28:27:72:530:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:national cost of nearly $7 billion dollars annually.3 This figure accounts only for the direct cost 
3:78:4524:27:28:72:518:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of remediation: it does not include the opportunity cost of time for students enrolled in these 
3:79:4620:28:27:72:530:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:courses, nor does it account for any impact, positive or negative, that remediation may have on 
3:80:4716:27:28:72:205:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:students’ future outcomes.  
3:81:4743:28:28:108:514:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The impacts of remediation are likely heterogeneous across individuals. Thus, like a 
3:82:4827:28:23:72:513:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costly medical intervention with non-negligible side effects, the net value of remediation in 
3:83:4920:23:8:216:219:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
3:84:4968:8:16:72:496:193:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f3:1 Authors’ calculations based on BPS:2009 data (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2012). 
3:85:5071:16:11:72:456:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:Times New Roman:Bachelor’s degree attainment rates are 59% for those entering with a four-year degree goal, and 
3:86:5167:11:7:72:482:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:Times New Roman:bachelor’s/associate’s degree attainment rates are 30% for those entering with a two-year degree goal. 
3:87:5269:7:16:72:522:159:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2 Estimate based on BPS:2009 transcript data for 2003-04 entrants (NCES, 2012). Estimates based upon student 
3:88:5377:16:7:72:488:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:self-reports are substantially lower, potentially because students do not realize the courses are remedial. 
3:89:5484:7:16:72:517:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:3 This estimate is based on first-time degree-seeking fall enrollees (NCES Digest of Education Statistics, 2011, 
3:90:5596:16:12:72:536:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Table 207). We estimate a cost of roughly $1,620 per student per remedial course, making the assumption that each 
3:91:5710:12:11:72:542:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:course is equivalent to a three-credit course or roughly 1/8th of a full-time year of college, and assuming the costs are 
3:92:5830:11:12:72:517:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:comparable to the costs at public two-year colleges which have total expenditures of $12,957 per FTE per year 
3:93:5940:12:11:72:490:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(Delta Cost Project, 2012). With an average of 1.3 remedial courses per entrant, this implies costs of 1.3 
3:94:6047:11:0:72:351:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:course*$1,620 per course*3.1 million students=$6.7 billion annually. 
4:95:6116:0:28:72:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:practice depends not just on the average effectiveness of the treatment, but also on whether or 
4:96:6212:28:28:72:488:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not the individuals most likely to benefit can be identified in advance. Of the two-year 
4:97:6301:28:27:72:488:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions where remediation is particularly concentrated, the vast majority use brief, 
4:98:6391:27:28:72:523:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:standardized tests administered to new students just prior to registration in order to determine 
4:99:6488:28:27:72:540:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:who needs remediation (Parsad, Lewis, & Greene, 2003). Often, assignment is determined solely 
4:100:6581:27:28:72:520:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on the basis of whether a score is above or below a certain cutoff. While several studies have 
4:101:6675:28:28:72:492:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leveraged the somewhat arbitrary nature of these cutoffs to identify the causal effect of 
4:102:6765:28:27:72:526:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediation, very little attention has been paid to the diagnostic value of the tests themselves.  
4:103:6862:27:28:108:509:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This is surprising given the potentially serious adverse consequences of incorrectly 
4:104:6947:28:27:72:498:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigning a truly prepared student to remediation. Prepared students who are assigned to 
4:105:7035:27:28:72:515:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediation may garner little or no educational benefit, but incur additional tuition and time 
4:106:7130:28:28:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs and may be discouraged from or delayed in their degree plans. Indeed, several studies using 
4:107:7228:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regression-discontinuity (RD) analysis to compare students just above and just below remedial 
4:108:7322:27:28:72:496:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test score cutoffs have generally found null to negative impacts of remediation for these 
4:109:7412:28:27:72:506:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“marginal” students. For example, Martorell and McFarlin (2011) examine administrative 
4:110:7499:27:28:72:532:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:records for over 250,000 students in Texas public two- and four-year colleges: those just below 
4:111:7594:28:28:72:482:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the test score threshold had significantly lower rates of persistence and college credit 
4:112:7683:28:27:72:534:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accumulation, with no impact on degree attainment and future labor market earnings. Studies in 
4:113:7778:27:28:72:538:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the state of Florida and an anonymous large northeastern urban community college system using 
4:114:7871:28:27:72:497:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:similar data and methods found similarly null to negative effects on academic outcomes 
4:115:7958:27:28:72:373:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Calcagno & Long, 2008; Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2012).  
4:116:8016:28:28:108:541:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A typical caveat in RD studies is that they identify average treatment effects that are local 
4:117:8109:28:0:72:526:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to students scoring near the cutoff—that is, the highest scoring remediated students—and thus 
5:118:8204:0:28:72:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one interpretation of the RD evidence may be that the existing remedial cutoffs are set too high. 
5:119:8302:28:28:72:530:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The available evidence regarding heterogeneity by ability does in fact suggest that the negative 
5:120:8398:28:27:72:495:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effects of remediation may be largest for higher-ability or lower-academic-risk students 
5:121:8487:27:28:72:396:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Martorell & McFarlin, 2011; Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2012).4  
5:122:8550:28:27:108:510:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover, assigning truly unprepared students directly to college-level coursework 
5:123:8633:27:28:72:532:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implies a different, but no less important set of potential costs. First, there is strong evidence of 
5:124:8734:28:28:72:516:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:peer effects in higher education, meaning that truly unprepared students who are incorrectly 
5:125:8827:28:27:72:519:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigned to college-level coursework might not only do worse academically than they would 
5:126:8917:27:28:72:525:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have otherwise, they might depress the achievement of their better-prepared peers (Sacerdote, 
5:127:9011:28:27:72:512:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2001; Zimmerman, 2003; Winston & Zimmerman, 2004; Carrell, Fullerton & West, 2009). 
5:128:9094:27:28:72:487:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second, there is evidence that at least some students fare better in college if they enter 
5:129:9185:28:28:72:537:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediation. Taking advantage of arbitrary variation in test cutoffs across four-year campuses in 
5:130:9283:28:27:72:536:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ohio, Bettinger & Long (2009) use distance to college as an instrument for the stringency of the 
5:131:9380:27:28:72:536:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cutoff policy an applicant was likely to face. They find that students who were more likely to be 
5:132:9478:28:27:72:497:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediated (by virtue of the cutoff policy at the nearest school) were also more likely to 
5:133:9569:27:28:72:525:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:complete a bachelor’s degree in four years. Similarly, several RD studies examining very low-
5:134:9662:28:28:72:535:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scoring students at the margin between higher and lower levels of remediation have found some 
5:135:9756:28:27:72:526:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:positive effects of being assigned to the more intensive remedial treatment (Boatman & Long, 
5:136:9849:27:28:72:251:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2010, Dadgar, 2012; Hodara, 2012).  
5:137:9884:28:27:108:533:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Improving the accuracy of the assignment process is thus of particular importance given 
5:138:9972:27:48:72:530:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the evidence for heterogeneous impacts across individuals, and given that the dominant pattern 
5:139:10065:48:8:216:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
5:140:10113:8:16:72:539:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:4 Both of these studies find some evidence that RD estimates are more negative when cutoffs fall lower in the ability 
5:141:10230:16:11:72:533:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:distribution; Scott-Clayton and Rodriguez (2012) also use pre-existing characteristics to examine impacts for high- 
5:142:10345:11:0:72:392:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:and low-academic risk students who all score around the same test score cutoff. 
6:143:10425:0:28:72:512:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of null to negative effects suggests remediation may be overprescribed as a treatment.5 The 
6:144:10516:28:28:72:509:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contribution of our study is to use a rich predictive model of college grades to simulate the 
6:145:10610:28:27:72:519:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prevalence of mis-assignment using common cutoff rules with the two most commonly-used 
6:146:10697:27:28:72:534:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial screening tests, to explore whether high school transcript information might be a more 
6:147:10793:28:27:72:518:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:valuable screening device, and to examine empirically how institutions trade-off the costs of 
6:148:10887:27:28:72:536:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigning either too many or too few students to remediation. We also test whether the choice of 
6:149:10983:28:28:72:482:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial screening device has disparate impacts by race or gender. Our analysis uses 
6:150:11067:28:27:72:539:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:administrative data including high school transcripts, remedial test scores, and college grades for 
6:151:11167:27:28:72:542:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tens of thousands of students in two large but otherwise distinct community college systems. One 
6:152:11263:28:27:72:535:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is a large urban community college system (LUCCS) with six affiliated campuses; the other is a 
6:153:11357:27:28:72:374:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:state-wide system of over 50 community colleges (SWCCS).6  
6:154:11414:28:28:108:523:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To preview our results, we find that roughly one in four test-takers in math and one in 
6:155:11502:28:27:72:490:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three test-takers in English are severely mis-assigned, with severe under-placements in 
6:156:11590:27:28:72:513:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediation much more common than severe over-placements in college-level coursework. 
6:157:11676:28:27:72:516:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Holding the remediation rate fixed, we find that using high school transcript information for 
6:158:11770:27:28:72:532:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial assignment—either instead of or in addition to test scores—could significantly reduce 
6:159:11865:28:28:72:538:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the prevalence of these assignment errors. Further, the choice of screening device has significant 
6:160:11964:28:27:72:526:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implications for the racial and gender composition of both remedial and college-level courses. 
6:161:12059:27:28:72:541:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, we find that if institutions took account of students’ high school performance, they could 
6:162:12159:28:29:72:530:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediate substantially fewer students without lowering success rates in college-level courses.  
6:163:12255:29:8:216:219:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
6:164:12303:8:16:72:507:147:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:5 While the medical treatment analogy is useful, it is also important to note that remediation may serve other 
6:165:12413:16:11:72:527:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:important institutional functions beyond just treating underprepared students (Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2012). 
6:166:12526:11:12:72:517:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:Times New Roman:Beyond its “developmental” purpose, being assigned to remedial education may provide students with an early 
6:167:12633:12:11:72:526:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:informative signal about their likelihood of college success, and/or it may serve as a means of rationing access to 
6:168:12749:11:12:72:519:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:already-crowded college courses. We believe the accuracy of the assignment process is no less important under 
6:169:12859:12:7:72:234:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:these alternative models of remediation. 
6:170:12899:7:0:72:507:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:6 Both systems requested confidentiality in exchange for permission to freely analyze and report on the data. 
7:171:13008:0:28:108:529:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The paper proceeds as follows: Section II provides background on remedial testing and 
7:172:13094:28:28:72:500:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:summarizes the relevant research on test validity. Section III describes the methodology, 
7:173:13183:28:27:72:508:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including our institutional context and data. Section IV presents our results, and Section V 
7:174:13275:27:40:72:327:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concludes with a discussion of policy implications.  
7:175:13326:40:30:72:353:586:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:II. Background on Remedial Testing and Test Validity 
7:176:13377:30:28:108:538:556:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:At non-selective, “open-access” two- and four-year institutions, many students’ first stop 
7:177:13467:28:28:72:539:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on campus will be to a testing center to be screened for remediation in reading/writing and math. 
7:178:13565:28:27:72:515:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In practice, institutional decisions about which screening tools to use and where to establish 
7:179:13660:27:28:72:536:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cutoffs for college-level coursework appear to be somewhat ad-hoc (Bettinger and Long 2009).7 
7:180:13753:28:27:72:537:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The affordability and efficiency of the screening tool itself are clearly important, particularly for 
7:181:13855:27:28:72:509:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:large institutions that may need to process thousands of entrants within a matter of weeks.  
7:182:13947:28:28:108:511:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Currently, two remedial placement exams dominate the market: ACCUPLACER®, 
7:183:14021:28:27:72:540:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed by the College Board, is used at 62 percent of community colleges, and COMPASS®, 
7:184:14110:27:28:72:518:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed by ACT, Inc., is used at 46 percent (Primary Research Group, 2008). Both testing 
7:185:14199:28:27:72:529:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suites offer a written essay exam as well as computer-adaptive tests in reading comprehension, 
7:186:14294:27:28:72:536:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:writing/sentence skills, and several modules of math (of which pre-algebra and algebra are most 
7:187:14390:28:28:72:542:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:common). The tests are not timed, but on average each test component takes less than 30 minutes 
7:188:14486:28:27:72:514:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to complete, such that an entire battery of placement exams may be completed in under two 
7:189:14576:27:28:72:536:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hours (College Board, 2007; ACT, Inc., 2006).8 Typically, colleges waive the placement test for 
7:190:14671:28:27:72:509:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students with high ACT or SAT scores. Those who fail the test(s) are assigned to remedial 
7:191:14761:27:33:72:535:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coursework, which may stretch from one to several courses depending upon the student’s score. 
7:192:14854:33:8:216:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
7:193:14902:8:16:72:517:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:7 However these decisions are made, they are increasingly made at a system- or even state-wide level (Hodara, 
7:194:15010:16:7:72:99:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2012). 
7:195:15016:7:0:72:517:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:8 Scores on the COMPASS® algebra exam may be determined by as few as eight questions (ACT, Inc., 2006). 
8:196:15117:0:28:72:517:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Unlike the SAT and ACT exams used for college admissions, no significant test preparation 
8:197:15207:28:28:72:518:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market has sprung up around placement exams, perhaps because many students are not even 
8:198:15295:28:27:72:534:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aware of these exams and their consequences until after admission. One recent qualitative study 
8:199:15389:27:28:72:533:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found that students were generally uninformed about remedial assessments, with some students 
8:200:15479:28:27:72:488:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:even believing it would be “cheating” to prepare (Venezia, Bracco, & Nodine, 2010).  
8:201:15560:27:28:72:258:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A. Related Literature on Test Validity  
8:202:15597:28:28:108:533:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Perhaps the simplest approach to evaluating the validity of a screening test is to identify 
8:203:15689:28:27:72:503:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the key outcome of interest and regress it on the predictor(s) of interest, either alone or in 
8:204:15784:27:28:72:510:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conjunction with other available predictors.9 The researcher then examines goodness-of-fit 
8:205:15874:28:27:72:509:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:statistics (R-squareds or correlation coefficients) as well as the size and significance of the 
8:206:15970:27:28:72:504:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resulting regression coefficients. This method has been used, for example, to examine the 
8:207:16060:28:28:72:541:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predictive validity of the SAT and ACT (Bowen & Bok, 1998; Bettinger, Evans, & Pope, 2011).  
8:208:16151:28:27:108:532:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:With respect to remedial placement exams, the College Board has published correlation 
8:209:16237:27:28:72:503:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coefficients relating each of the ACCUPLACER® modules to measures of success in the 
8:210:16321:28:27:72:530:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relevant college credit-bearing course, with correlations ranging from 0.23 to 0.29 for the math 
8:211:16418:27:28:72:520:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exams and from 0.10 to 0.19 in reading/writing (Mattern & Packman, 2009). In two working 
8:212:16507:28:28:72:527:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:papers related to this study, Scott-Clayton (2012) finds comparable correlation coefficients for 
8:213:16604:28:27:72:537:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the COMPASS® in a large urban community college system (ranging from 0.19 to 0.35 in math 
8:214:16693:27:28:72:531:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and 0.06 to 0.15 in English), while Belfield and Crosta (2012) find much lower correlations for 
8:215:16789:28:64:72:503:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:both COMPASS® and ACCUPLACER® at a state-wide system of community colleges.  
8:216:16865:64:7:216:219:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
8:217:16913:7:16:72:521:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:9 We recognize that a test per se cannot be validated: it is its use in a given context which is validated (Brennan, 
8:218:17028:16:12:72:528:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2006). We focus here on screening devices for course placement in math and English, under the hypothesis that if 
8:219:17141:12:11:72:538:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the tests are not valid for placement in their own subject they are unlikely to be valid for placement in other subjects 
8:220:17262:11:0:72:269:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:less directly related to the material on the exams. 
9:221:17314:0:28:108:481:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Goodness-of-fit analyses, however, necessitate several caveats. Linearity and 
9:222:17392:28:28:72:527:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:distributional assumptions may be violated in the case of dichotomous or ordinal outcomes. In 
9:223:17485:28:27:72:522:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:addition, these statistics may be biased downward because of the restricted range of variation 
9:224:17580:27:28:72:523:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over which they must be computed (ACT, Inc., 2006).10 More fundamentally, these measures 
9:225:17668:28:27:72:530:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provide no tangible estimates of how many students are correctly or incorrectly assigned under 
9:226:17763:27:28:72:537:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:different screening devices, nor any practical guidance for policymakers wondering whether test 
9:227:17859:28:28:72:232:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cutoffs are set in the right place.  
9:228:17895:28:27:108:523:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A second approach is to examine success rates in the college-level course for students 
9:229:17982:27:28:72:537:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:selected on the basis of different screening devices and assignment thresholds. Bettinger, Evans, 
9:230:18079:28:27:72:517:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:& Pope (2012) perform this type of analysis with respect to the ACT, simulating the college 
9:231:18171:27:28:72:507:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dropout rates that would result depending upon how ACT subtest scores are weighted in a 
9:232:18259:28:28:72:528:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college admissions process with a fixed number of spots. Examining test validity in a different 
9:233:18354:28:27:72:537:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:context, Autor & Scarborough (2008) observe how the productivity of job hires (as measured by 
9:234:18447:27:28:72:501:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:length of employment) changes when employment tests are introduced into the applicant 
9:235:18533:28:27:72:489:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening process. These types of analyses are useful but focus on only one side of the 
9:236:18621:27:28:72:497:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assignment process. In the case of remediation, policymakers may worry not only about 
9:237:18707:28:28:72:523:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unprepared students being assigned to college-level work, but also about adequately prepared 
9:238:18800:28:27:72:499:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students being assigned to remediation. As discussed above, both types of mistakes have 
9:239:18887:27:69:72:210:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potentially significant costs. 
9:240:18917:69:7:216:219:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
9:241:18965:7:16:72:500:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:10 This range restriction occurs because the relationship between test scores and college grades can only be 
9:242:19073:16:12:72:515:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:computed for those whose scores allow them directly into college-level courses. Statistical corrections that are 
9:243:19186:12:11:72:492:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:sometimes employed in an effort to address this restriction-of-range may themselves rely on implausible 
9:244:19290:11:12:72:534:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:assumptions (Rothstein, 2004). While in theory one could examine the relationship between test scores and college 
9:245:19404:12:11:72:526:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:grades for any student who ever makes it to college coursework, for students initially assigned to remediation the 
9:246:19518:11:0:72:424:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:treatment may confound the relationship between initial scores and future performance. 
10:247:19605:0:28:108:533:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A third approach, which we develop for our primary analyses, is to analyze measures of 
10:248:19692:28:28:72:492:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:diagnostic accuracy, or “the ability to correctly classify subjects into clinically relevant 
10:249:19785:28:27:72:496:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subgroups” (Zweig & Campbell, 1993). This approach has a long history in the medical 
10:250:19870:27:28:72:514:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening literature and a more recent history in educational measurement, but has not been 
10:251:19962:28:27:72:534:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:widely applied in economics or education policy research.11 Such analyses may utilize a variety 
10:252:20057:27:28:72:541:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of metrics, but all aim to quantify the frequencies of accurate diagnoses, false-positive diagnoses, 
10:253:20158:28:28:72:538:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and false-negative diagnoses using a given test and classification threshold.12 If decision-makers 
10:254:20256:28:27:72:510:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also have information on the costs and benefits of each type of event (as well as the cost of 
10:255:20349:27:28:72:526:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:testing itself), the event frequencies can be weighted accordingly and combined into a welfare 
10:256:20444:28:27:72:530:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:function (or loss function) that can guide the selection of the optimal screening tool and cutoff. 
10:257:20542:27:28:108:541:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sawyer (1996) is the first to apply this type of decision theory framework to the choice of 
10:258:20633:28:28:72:511:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial screening tests.  He notes that no assignment rule can avoid making errors—some 
10:259:20720:28:27:72:527:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students who could have succeeded in the college-level course will be assigned to remediation 
10:260:20814:27:28:72:536:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(an under-placement error), while some students who cannot succeed at the college level will be 
10:261:20910:28:27:72:525:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placed there anyway (an over-placement error). Figure 1 summarizes the four potential events 
10:262:21003:27:28:72:519:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that result from an assignment decision by cross-tabulating potential outcomes in the college 
10:263:21097:28:28:72:314:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level course against actual treatment assignments. 
10:264:21147:28:27:108:536:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The assignment accuracy rate, which adds the proportions of students in cells (1) and (4) 
10:265:21237:27:23:72:527:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of Figure 1, derives from an implied welfare function in which the decision-maker gives equal 
10:266:21331:23:7:216:219:189:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
10:267:21379:7:16:72:521:182:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:11 This could be due to a longstanding focus on identifying average treatment effects: as long as such effects are 
10:268:21493:16:12:72:512:166:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:constant, then the matter of identifying whom to treat is less important. But given an increasing interest in the 
10:269:21607:12:11:72:525:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:potential heterogeneity of treatment effects, it will become increasingly important to develop assignment tools to 
10:270:21721:11:7:72:220:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:more accurately target interventions. 
10:271:21758:7:16:72:521:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:12 For example, researchers studying the accuracy of an automated Pap smear test in the 1950s analyzed rates of 
10:272:21869:16:12:72:501:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:false-positive and false-negative classifications for a range of possible diagnostic thresholds, then used this 
10:273:21981:12:11:72:528:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:information to determine the optimal threshold (Lusted, 1984). The automated Pap smear test was analyzed using 
10:274:22091:11:12:72:529:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:something similar to receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots, which for any given diagnostic threshold, plot 
10:275:22206:12:11:72:504:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:what proportion of the healthy are falsely identified as sick against what proportion of the sick are correctly 
10:276:22318:11:0:72:146:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:identified as such. 
11:277:22338:0:28:72:514:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:weight to students placed accurately into remediation or college-level coursework, and zero 
11:278:22430:28:28:72:541:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:weight to under- and over-placement errors. Publishers of the two most commonly used remedial 
11:279:22523:28:27:72:505:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placement exams now provide estimated placement accuracy rates, ranging from 60 to 80 
11:280:22608:27:28:72:527:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent, to help support their validity (ACT, Inc., 2006; Mattern & Packman, 2009). In related 
11:281:22702:28:27:72:533:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:working papers using the same data utilized here, Scott-Clayton (2012) and Belfield and Crosta 
11:282:22797:27:28:72:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:(2012) also find accuracy rates in this range, at least when “success” in college coursework is 
11:283:22893:28:28:72:231:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:defined as earning a B or better.  
11:284:22926:28:27:108:534:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:But accuracy rates may vary depending upon how success is defined: this can be seen in 
11:285:23013:27:28:72:527:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure 2, which provides a schematic plot of college math success rates against placement test 
11:286:23108:28:27:72:542:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scores. Among students scoring at the hypothetical cutoff, 45% earn a B or better in college-level 
11:287:23206:27:28:72:523:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:math (bottom line), 62% earn a C or better (middle line), and 74% can at least pass (top line). 
11:288:23299:28:28:72:513:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus, if placed in remediation 45% of these students at the cutoff (as well as the proportion 
11:289:23393:28:27:72:533:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicated by the B-or-better line for students with scores below the cutoff) will be under-placed 
11:290:23490:27:28:72:498:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by any criterion; if placed in college-level then 26% of those at the cutoff (as well as the 
11:291:23580:28:27:72:513:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proportion indicated by one minus the passing percentage for student with scores above the 
11:292:23671:27:28:72:536:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cutoff) will be over-placed by any criterion. The remaining proportion who would earn a C or D 
11:293:23765:28:28:72:535:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are ambiguously classified; placing them into the college-level course is correct under a passing 
11:294:23863:28:27:72:512:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:criterion for success, but is a mistake under the B-or-better success criterion. Prior research 
11:295:23959:27:28:72:535:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consistently finds that remedial tests are more accurate at classifying students based on the B-or-
11:296:24058:28:27:72:512:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:better criterion than on lower success criteria (ACT, Inc., 2006; Mattern & Packman, 2009; 
11:297:24149:27:0:72:520:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Scott-Clayton, 2012; Belfield & Crosta, 2012). Scott-Clayton (2012) and Belfield and Crosta 
12:298:24242:0:28:72:519:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2012) find that when the goal is simply identifying who will pass versus fail, accuracy rates 
12:299:24337:28:28:72:267:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:range between just 36 and 50 percent.13  
12:300:24375:28:27:108:520:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our analysis (described in detail below) will focus on error rates rather than accuracy 
12:301:24461:27:28:72:532:626:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:rates, for two reasons. First, Sawyer’s (1996) study demonstrates how policy conclusions based 
12:302:24556:28:27:72:533:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on accuracy rates can shift dramatically depending upon the definition of success. He compares 
12:303:24651:27:28:72:519:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accuracy rates using ACT math subtest scores versus using a locally-developed test for math 
12:304:24743:28:28:72:511:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placement at a large public institution in the Midwest. He finds that if success is defined as 
12:305:24838:28:27:72:525:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:earning a B or better, using the ACT math subscore with a relatively high cutoff generates the 
12:306:24933:27:28:72:522:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:best accuracy rates, while if success is defined as earning only a C or better, using the locally-
12:307:25031:28:27:72:532:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed test with a relatively low cutoff generates the best accuracy rates. Second, his results 
12:308:25130:27:28:72:522:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicate that a wide range of potential cutoffs can generate similar accuracy rates, even as the 
12:309:25227:28:28:72:539:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mix of over-placement and under-placement errors changes substantially. Since these errors may 
12:310:25321:28:27:72:533:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have different costs (and will fall on different students), it is useful to consider them separately. 
12:311:25421:27:28:72:340:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B. The Potential Value of High School Transcript Data 
12:312:25474:28:27:108:532:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Even the test publishers themselves emphasize that test scores should not be used as the 
12:313:25563:27:28:72:520:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sole factor in placement decisions (see e.g. Accuplacer Coordinator’s Guide, College Board, 
12:314:25655:28:28:72:538:267:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:2007). One potentially rich source of additional information is a student’s high school transcript, 
12:315:25754:28:27:72:528:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:used either in conjunction with or as an alternative to placement tests for deciding on remedial 
12:316:25851:27:28:72:497:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assignment. Transcripts are readily accessible, as most students submit their high school 
12:317:25940:28:27:72:538:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transcripts as part of the admissions process, and may yield a wealth of information on cognitive 
12:318:26037:27:28:72:529:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:skills, subject-specific knowledge, as well as student effort and motivation. Moreover, because 
12:319:26132:28:32:72:541:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they are accumulated over time across a range of courses and instructors, high school grade point 
12:320:26230:32:7:216:219:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
12:321:26278:7:16:72:529:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:13 This may be because (to paraphrase Tolstoy) all good students are alike, while struggling students may struggle 
12:322:26392:16:0:72:383:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:for a multitude of reasons—only some of which are related to aptitude per se. 
13:323:26471:0:28:72:530:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:averages (GPAs) and courses completed may simply be less noisy than brief, “one-off” exams. 
13:324:26563:28:28:72:512:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Yet to the best of our knowledge, high school grades and coursework have not been widely 
13:325:26652:28:27:72:482:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:utilized or even studied as potential screening tools for assignment into remediation.  
13:326:26739:27:28:108:533:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This is surprising given their demonstrated explanatory power for college outcomes and 
13:327:26826:28:27:72:525:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:beyond. Studies have found strong associations between high school GPA and freshman GPA 
13:328:26911:27:28:72:538:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Rothstein, 2004), as well as between high school efforts and college enrollment (on high school 
13:329:27008:28:28:72:536:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:algebra, see Gamoran & Hannigan, 2000; on high school coursework, see Long et al., 2012; and 
13:330:27101:28:27:72:539:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on curricular intensity in high school, see Attewell & Domina, 2008). A related study by Long et 
13:331:27197:27:28:72:527:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:al. (2009) looks at the influence of high school transcripts on the need for math remediation in 
13:332:27294:28:27:72:512:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Florida. However, remediation is identified as failing the Florida Common Placement Test, 
13:333:27383:27:28:72:529:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which presupposes the validity of the placement test. Nevertheless, the results from Long et al. 
13:334:27480:28:28:72:529:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2009) suggest a strong influence of high school curriculum: remediation need varies inversely 
13:335:27575:28:27:72:482:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with 8th grade math scores and with the level of math taken in high school. Plausibly, 
13:336:27660:27:28:72:466:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information from high school appears to be predictive of performance in college.  
13:337:27740:28:27:108:542:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The optimal decision rule may be a combination of placement tests and transcripts (Noble 
13:338:27828:27:28:72:535:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:& Sawyer, 2004). A major contribution of our study is to compare the usefulness of high school 
13:339:27922:28:28:72:512:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transcript information either instead of or in addition to remedial test scores, and to explore 
13:340:28017:28:39:72:457:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whether the choice of screening device has disparate impacts by race or gender. 
13:341:28094:39:31:72:165:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:III. Methodology  
13:342:28110:31:27:108:516:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We use a rich predictive model of college grades to examine several validity metrics 
13:343:28194:27:28:72:522:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:under alternative policy simulations, focusing on three questions. First, how well do remedial 
13:344:28287:28:28:72:485:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening tests identify students who are likely or unlikely to succeed in college-level 
13:345:28376:28:0:72:491:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:coursework? Second, what is the incremental value of such tests above and beyond the 
14:346:28463:0:28:72:504:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information provided by high school transcripts generally and HS GPA in particular? We 
14:347:28550:28:28:72:515:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:examine these questions for the full sample and for subgroups by race/ethnicity and gender. 
14:348:28642:28:27:72:539:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, what are the trade-offs involved in establishing higher versus lower screening thresholds 
14:349:28741:27:28:72:492:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for remedial “treatment,” and what does the chosen threshold reveal about institutional 
14:350:28829:28:27:72:138:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:preferences?  
14:351:28841:27:28:72:335:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A. Validity Metrics and Alternative Screening Policies 
14:352:28894:28:28:108:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To address the potential oversimplification of examining a single placement accuracy 
14:353:28979:28:27:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate, the simple two-by-two chart in Figure 1 could be expanded to include multiple gradations of 
14:354:29077:27:28:72:542:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:success, and policymakers could assign separate weights to every possible outcome. But it would 
14:355:29173:28:27:72:543:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be presumptuous for researchers to attempt to completely specify the weights in a highly intricate 
14:356:29272:27:28:72:525:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:welfare function. Instead, we propose a simple alternative to the accuracy rate: a loss function 
14:357:29369:28:28:72:503:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that we call the severe error rate (SER). Specifically, the SER combines the proportion of 
14:358:29459:28:27:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students predicted to earn a B or better in college-level but instead placed into remediation (the 
14:359:29558:27:28:72:537:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:severe under-placement rate, or region D in Figure 2) with the proportion of students placed into 
14:360:29656:28:27:72:540:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college-level but predicted to fail there (the severe over-placement rate, or region E in Figure 2).  
14:361:29757:27:28:108:531:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We see at least two advantages of the SER relative to placement accuracy rates. First, it 
14:362:29847:28:28:72:541:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:focuses attention on the most severe assignment errors, which may be associated with the highest 
14:363:29944:28:27:72:536:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs. While there may be disagreement about the “correct” placement for a student predicted to 
14:364:30040:27:28:72:539:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:earn only a C or D in a college-level course, it seems uncontroversial that a student likely to earn 
14:365:30141:28:27:72:516:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:an A or B should be placed directly into college-level and a student likely to fail should not. 
14:366:30236:27:28:72:536:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second, by breaking the SER into its two components, we allow for severe over-placements and 
14:367:30328:28:0:72:423:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:severe under-placements to have different weights in a welfare analysis.  
15:368:30402:0:28:108:487:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, to acknowledge that policymakers may care about factors beyond mis-
15:369:30477:28:28:72:510:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assignment rates, we show two additional metrics for each policy simulation: the predicted 
15:370:30568:28:27:72:515:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:success rate among those placed directly into the college-level course (using the C-or-better 
15:371:30662:27:28:72:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:criterion) and the remediation rate. For example, given two different assignment systems with 
15:372:30756:28:27:72:540:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the same overall error rates, policymakers may prefer the system that has a higher success rate in 
15:373:30855:27:28:72:531:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the college-level course. And even when we hold the remediation rate fixed overall, alternative 
15:374:30951:28:28:72:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening devices may differentially affect remediation rates within race or gender subgroups, 
15:375:31046:28:27:72:242:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:something that we examine below. 
15:376:31078:27:28:108:527:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We examine these metrics under the current test-score cutoff-based policies in place in 
15:377:31166:28:27:72:493:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:each system (using pre-algebra and algebra test scores to screen for remedial math, and 
15:378:31253:27:28:72:536:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reading/writing test scores to screen for remedial English). We then compare the results to those 
15:379:31351:28:28:72:534:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:obtained with two alternative screening devices, holding the proportion assigned to remediation 
15:380:31446:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fixed: 1) using an index of high school achievement alone, using information from high school 
15:381:31540:27:28:72:527:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transcripts, and 2) using an index that combines both test scores and high school achievement. 
15:382:31631:28:27:72:523:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Later, we examine how these metrics vary as we vary the proportion assigned to remediation, 
15:383:31723:27:40:72:290:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:holding the choice of screening device fixed. 
15:384:31768:40:31:72:343:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B. Estimating Severe Under- and Over-placement Rates 
15:385:31819:31:27:108:527:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The SER combines the proportion of students predicted to earn a B or better in college-
15:386:31906:27:28:72:542:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level but instead placed into remediation (the severe under-placement rate) with the proportion of 
15:387:32005:28:27:72:542:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students placed into college-level but predicted to fail there (the severe over-placement rate). The 
15:388:32106:27:0:72:529:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:first step in calculating severe error rates is thus to estimate rich predictive models of students’ 
16:389:32204:0:28:72:540:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:probability of failing the college-level course as well as the probability of earning a B or better.14 
16:390:32305:28:28:72:515:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To do this, we restrict the sample to those who ever enrolled in a college-level course in the 
16:391:32400:28:27:72:522:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relevant subject (math or English) without taking a remedial course in that subject first.15 We 
16:392:32494:27:28:72:516:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:refer to this as the math or English estimation sample. Separately for college-level math and 
16:393:32588:28:28:72:369:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:English courses, we run the following two probit regressions:

16:397:32843:28:27:72:531:479:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and reading/writing test scores for college English outcomes, HSAch is a vector of high school 
16:398:32937:27:28:72:492:452:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:achievement measures including cumulative GPA and credits accumulated (the precise 
16:399:33018:28:27:72:536:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measures, described in the data section below, vary somewhat across our two systems), and X is 
16:400:33112:27:28:72:530:397:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a vector of other demographic variables that have predictive value. For the LUCCS analysis, X 
16:401:33205:28:28:72:511:369:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:includes race/ethnicity, gender, age, ESL status, years since high school graduation, and an 
16:402:33298:28:27:72:503:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicator of whether or not the individual previously attended a local high school. For the 
16:403:33390:27:28:72:505:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:SWCCS analysis, the model includes race/ethnicity and gender. For both systems we also 
16:404:33476:28:27:72:536:286:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:include interactions of test scores and high school achievement with race/gender.16 Even though 
16:405:33570:27:28:72:523:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:these demographic variables cannot be used in the assignment process, they help improve the 
16:406:33662:28:30:72:325:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:predictions that underlie our estimated error rates.17  
16:407:33716:30:8:216:219:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
16:408:33764:8:16:72:532:193:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:14 We group withdrawals and incompletes as failures given evidence that these outcomes are grade related (Ang & 
16:409:33874:16:7:72:129:177:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Noble, 1993). 
16:410:33887:7:16:72:522:170:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:15 Analyzing the relationship between pre-treatment predictors and grades for those who took remediation could 
16:411:33997:16:11:72:535:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:confound the estimates for two reasons: 1) the remedial treatment may effectively eliminate skill deficiencies, or 2) 
16:412:34115:11:7:72:532:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the only remediated students who make it to college-level courses may have high levels of unobserved motivation. 
16:413:34227:7:16:72:528:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:16 We do not use reading/writing test scores in our predictive model for college math grades or vice versa because 
16:414:34341:16:12:72:524:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:this would require limiting the sample to students who took tests in both subjects, and the incremental predictive 
16:415:34456:12:7:72:330:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:power of the cross-subject test scores was comparatively small.  
16:416:34520:7:16:72:526:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:17 Because we are ultimately interested in estimating overall error rates and not in predicting individual outcomes 
16:417:34635:16:11:72:520:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:per se, the inclusion of these demographic variables turns out to make virtually no difference to our full-sample 
16:418:34749:11:0:72:405:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:estimates of our validity metrics. Full regression results are available upon request. 
17:419:34837:0:28:108:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After running these two regressions for the estimation sample, we then compute predicted 
17:420:34926:28:28:72:518:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:probabilities of failing or earning a B-or-better for all students with available data, including 
17:421:35022:28:27:72:528:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:those scoring below the cutoff (we call this larger group the prediction sample). The following 
17:422:35118:27:28:72:511:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equations describe how these predicted probabilities are used to compute the probability of 
17:423:35209:28:28:72:524:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:severe under-placement or over-placement for each individual under a given assignment rule:

17:426:35431:29:28:72:541:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:An individual’s probability of being severely misplaced is simply the sum of over-placement and 
17:427:35527:28:28:72:515:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:under-placement probabilities from (2) and (3). The SER for the sample as a whole, or for a 
17:428:35619:28:27:72:415:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:given subgroup, is simply the average of these individual probabilities. 
17:429:35690:27:28:108:532:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:When we simulate severe error rates using alternative screening devices, the underlying 
17:430:35777:28:27:72:538:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:probabilities of success from (1a) and (1b) remain fixed and we simply vary the assignment rule. 
17:431:35874:27:28:72:540:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:When comparing across screening devices we initially choose cutoffs that ensure the proportions 
17:432:35970:28:28:72:540:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigned to remediation remain roughly constant. If the alternative device were a single measure, 
17:433:36067:28:27:72:482:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:such as cumulative high school GPA, we could simply set the cutoff at the percentile 
17:434:36152:27:28:72:535:290:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding to the current test-score based cutoff. But since we are simulating alternative sets 
17:435:36249:28:27:72:530:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of predictors, we first combine these multiple measures into a single regression-based index.18  
17:436:36344:27:28:72:257:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C. Addressing extrapolation concerns 
17:437:36380:28:28:108:529:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A limitation of this type of analysis is that it requires extrapolation of relationships that 
17:438:36474:28:27:72:512:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are observed only for those placing directly into college-level to those who score below the 
17:439:36567:27:43:72:534:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current test cutoff. There is no way to be sure that the observed relationship between scores and 
17:440:36665:43:8:216:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
17:441:36713:8:16:72:534:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:18 So, for example, to select the cutoff in math using high school information, we regress college-level math grades 
17:442:36828:16:11:72:519:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(among only those assigned directly to college-level) on the set of high school achievement variables described 
17:443:36939:11:0:72:416:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:above, and establish the cutoff as the 75th percentile on this index of predicted grades. 
18:444:37029:0:28:72:527:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outcomes for high-scorers is equally applicable to very low-scorers.19 For at least two reasons, 
18:445:37125:28:28:72:529:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:however, it may be reasonable to extrapolate within a limited range below the cutoff. First, the 
18:446:37221:28:27:72:500:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test scores themselves are quite noisy; the COMPASS algebra module for example has a 
18:447:37306:27:28:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:standard error of measurement of 8 points, meaning a score of 30 (LUCCS cutoff for the most 
18:448:37398:28:27:72:531:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recent cohorts) is not distinguishable with 95% confidence even from the lowest possible score 
18:449:37493:27:28:72:513:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of 15 (ACT, Inc., 2006, p. 92). Second, the earlier cohorts in LUCCS were subject to lower 
18:450:37584:28:28:72:539:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cutoffs (27 for the two math modules, 65 for the reading module) meaning that we do have some 
18:451:37677:28:27:72:486:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:observations below the current cutoffs that do not rely upon extrapolation. To address 
18:452:37764:27:28:72:526:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extrapolation concerns, we perform a sensitivity analysis in which we exclude at the outset all 
18:453:37860:28:27:72:392:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students with test scores substantially below the current cutoffs.20  
18:454:37928:27:28:72:236:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:D. Institutional Context and Data 
18:455:37961:28:28:108:531:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We analyze two very large, but distinct community college systems in order to improve 
18:456:38046:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the generalizability of our results. The datasets for this analysis were provided under restricted-
18:457:38144:27:28:72:540:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:use agreements with a large, urban community college system (LUCCS) including six individual 
18:458:38236:28:27:72:510:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions, and a state-wide community college system (SWCCS) comprising 50 separate 
18:459:38323:27:28:72:537:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions.21 For additional detail on institutional context, see Scott-Clayton (2012) for LUCCS 
18:460:38421:28:28:72:287:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Belfield and Crosta (2012) for SWCCS. 
18:461:38462:28:27:108:515:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During our study period, LUCCS was using the COMPASS® test, with modules for 
18:462:38539:27:28:72:519:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:numerical skills/pre-algebra, algebra, and reading, as well as a writing exam adapted slightly 
18:463:38633:28:18:72:532:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from the standard COMPASS® writing module (each writing exam is graded in a double-blind 
18:464:38721:18:7:216:219:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
18:465:38769:7:16:72:526:159:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:19 It is worth noting, however, that restriction-of-range in our initial predictive model does not necessarily lead to 
18:466:38886:16:12:72:537:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:biased accuracy and error rates. In contrast, goodness-of-fit statistics may be biased by range restrictions even when 
18:467:39005:12:7:72:425:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:regression coefficients based upon the restricted sample are unbiased (Rothstein, 2004). 
18:468:39093:7:16:72:527:124:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:20 It also bears emphasis that simulations of success rates above the current cutoffs do not rely upon extrapolation 
18:469:39209:16:7:72:539:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:and are of policy relevance on their own since many institutions, including LUCCS, have increased cutoffs recently. 
18:470:39323:7:16:72:514:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:21 The LUCCS data come from four cohorts of nearly 70,000 first-time degree-seekers who entered one of the 
18:471:39429:16:11:72:527:85:10:g_d0_f3:10:Times New Roman:system’s colleges in the fall of 2004 through 2007. The SWCCS data is from two cohorts of 49,000 students who 
18:472:39538:11:0:72:420:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:enrolled in the academic years 2008-2010, almost all of whom are in degree programs. 
19:473:39624:0:28:72:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system by two LUCCS readers at a central location). The SWCCS permits a range of placement 
19:474:39714:28:28:72:533:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tests, although the majority of students took either ACCUPLACER® or COMPASS® tests (we 
19:475:39801:28:27:72:502:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analyze the ACCUPLACER® and COMPASS® samples separately at SWCCS). In both 
19:476:39875:27:28:72:534:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:systems, test cutoffs are established centrally, and students’ compliance with course assignment 
19:477:39972:28:27:72:484:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decisions is high: while some students may not enroll in the required remedial course 
19:478:40058:27:28:72:530:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:immediately, relatively few circumvent remediation to enroll directly in a college-level course. 
19:479:40153:28:28:72:514:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Re-testing is not allowed at LUCCS until after remedial coursework has been completed; at 
19:480:40243:28:27:72:537:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:SWCCS approximately 10-15 percent of students retest prior to initial enrollment. In both cases, 
19:481:40340:27:28:72:518:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we use the maximum test score (prior to enrollment) for our simulations since this is what is 
19:482:40434:28:27:72:263:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actually used for placement in practice. 
19:483:40474:27:28:108:529:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 1 provides demographic information on the full sample and main subsamples for 
19:484:40557:28:28:72:529:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the predictive validity analysis. The first column describes the overall populations. Subsequent 
19:485:40653:28:27:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:columns are limited to students who took a placement exam in the respective subjects and then 
19:486:40747:27:28:72:541:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:further restricted to those with high school information available. Note that these students tend to 
19:487:40848:28:27:72:528:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be younger and are more likely to have entered college directly from high school. Table 1 also 
19:488:40942:27:28:72:506:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shows the percentages assigned to remedial coursework in each subject as a result of their 
19:489:41033:28:28:72:191:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placement exam scores.  
19:490:41055:28:27:108:527:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For LUCCS, as at higher education institutions generally, nearly six out of ten entrants 
19:491:41143:27:28:72:540:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are female. While more than half of LUCCS entrants are age 19 or under and come directly from 
19:492:41237:28:27:72:537:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:high school, nearly one-quarter are 22 or older, and on average entrants are 2.6 years out of high 
19:493:41336:27:28:72:516:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school. Finally, LUCCS is highly diverse (over one-third of students are Hispanic, over one-
19:494:41428:28:28:72:504:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:quarter are black, and over ten percent are of Asian descent). Across these four cohorts of 
19:495:41519:28:0:72:531:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:LUCCS entrants, more than three-quarters were assigned to remediation in at least one subject: 
20:496:41616:0:28:72:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:63 percent in math, 59 percent in writing or reading. The proportions among those who actually 
20:497:41711:28:28:72:528:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:take the placement exams is necessarily higher, with 78 percent of math test takers assigned to 
20:498:41807:28:27:72:517:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:math remediation, 76 percent of reading/writing test takers assigned to writing remediation.  
20:499:41900:27:28:108:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For SWCCS, a slight majority of students are female and the typical entrant is a couple of 
20:500:41991:28:27:72:540:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:years out of high school. In contrast to LUCCS, only one-third of the students are minorities. But 
20:501:42090:27:28:72:530:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:SWCCS shows similarly high rates of remedial assignment: 70% in math, 58% in English, and 
20:502:42180:28:28:72:534:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three-quarters overall. These rates are slightly higher for our math and English testing samples.  
20:503:42277:28:27:108:499:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our measures of high school achievement differ somewhat between LUCCS and 
20:504:42351:27:28:72:540:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:SWCCS. For LUCCS, the high school data comes from transcripts that are submitted as part of a 
20:505:42445:28:27:72:534:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:system-wide college application process.22  Staff at the system’s central office identify “college-
20:506:42542:27:28:72:536:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:preparatory” courses in key subjects from the transcripts, and record the total number of college-
20:507:42640:28:28:72:512:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:preparatory units and average grades earned within each subject and overall. Thus our high 
20:508:42731:28:27:72:520:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school measures for LUCCS include cumulative grade point averages both overall and in the 
20:509:42821:27:28:72:540:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relevant subject; cumulative numbers of college-preparatory units completed, both overall and in 
20:510:42918:28:27:72:522:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the relevant subject; and indicators of whether any college-preparatory units were completed, 
20:511:43012:27:28:72:267:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:both overall and in the relevant subject.  
20:512:43054:28:28:108:532:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: For SWCCS, our high school data come from an administrative data match to statewide 
20:513:43138:28:27:72:508:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:K-12 public school records (and thus are only available for students who attended a public 
20:514:43229:27:28:72:535:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school).23 The high school measures we use for SWCCS are: unweighted high school GPA, and 
20:515:43317:28:64:72:483:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from 11th and 12th grade transcripts: the total number of courses taken, the number of

20:517:43450:7:16:72:523:113:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f3:22 Students who simply show up on a given campus are known as “direct admits” and typically have much more 
20:518:43555:16:7:72:357:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:limited background information available in the system-wide database. 
20:519:43624:7:16:72:542:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:23 Though most of these students had both GPA and detailed transcript data, for some we only had GPA information. 
20:520:43735:16:0:72:392:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Differences between our sample and students without HS GPAs were not large. 
21:521:43812:0:28:72:507:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:honors/advanced courses, the number of math courses, the number of English courses, the

21:524:43979:39:31:72:313:602:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A. Severe Error Rates and Other Validity Metrics 
21:525:44026:31:27:108:527:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 2 reports severe error rates and other validity metrics using alternative screening 
21:526:44114:27:28:72:516:544:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:devices for remedial placement. Focusing first on the “test scores” column, which simulates 
21:527:44205:28:28:72:540:516:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current policy at LUCCS and SWCCS, we see that one-quarter to one-third of tested students are 
21:528:44300:28:27:72:532:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:severely misplaced depending upon the sample and subject. Recall that this does not imply that 
21:529:44395:27:28:72:505:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the remainder are all accurately placed, just that they are not severely misplaced. With the 
21:530:44487:28:27:72:539:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exception of the ACCUPLACER® math sample at SWCCS, severe under-placements are two to 
21:531:44572:27:28:72:522:406:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:six times more prevalent than severe over-placements. In LUCCS, for example, nearly one in 
21:532:44663:28:28:72:541:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:five students who take a math test, and more than one in four students who take the English tests, 
21:533:44762:28:27:72:539:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are placed into remediation even though they could have earned a B or better in the college-level 
21:534:44860:27:28:72:530:323:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:course. This implies that nearly a quarter of remediated students in math (=18.5/76.1), and one-
21:535:44956:28:27:72:542:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:third of remediated students in English (=28.9/80.5), are students who probably do not need to be 
21:536:45054:27:28:72:105:268:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there.  
21:537:45061:28:28:108:533:240:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In all of our samples for both subjects, holding the remediation rate fixed but using high 
21:538:45152:28:27:72:521:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school achievement instead of test scores to assign students results in both lower severe error 
21:539:45247:27:28:72:519:185:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates and higher success rates among those assigned to college level. The reduction in severe 
21:540:45341:28:27:72:514:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:error rates comes from reductions in both under-placements and over-placements, so unlike 
21:541:45431:27:28:72:536:130:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:debates about where cutoffs should be optimally set, there is no tradeoff here between these two 
21:542:45528:28:28:72:536:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:types of errors. With the exception of math placement in LUCCS, the reductions are substantial, 
21:543:45624:28:0:72:523:74:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suggesting that out of 100 students tested, 4 to 8 fewer students would be severely misplaced, 
22:544:45721:0:28:72:521:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:representing up to a 30 percent reduction in severe errors compared to test-based placements. 
22:545:45815:28:28:72:505:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Also with the exception of math placement in LUCCS, for which improvements are more 
22:546:45899:28:27:72:526:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:modest, using high school achievement instead of test scores results improves the success rate 
22:547:45994:27:28:72:508:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:among those placed in college level by roughly 10 percentage points. For example, among 
22:548:46082:28:27:72:536:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students assigned directly to college-level, the percentage earning at least a C or better increases 
22:549:46183:27:28:72:506:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from 76 percent to 89 percent in the SWCCS COMPASS® sample, even though the same 
22:550:46263:28:28:72:232:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:number of students are admitted. 
22:551:46295:28:27:108:520:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Utilizing both test scores and high school transcript data for assignment generates the 
22:552:46383:27:28:72:533:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:best placement outcomes at LUCCS, although the incremental improvement beyond using high 
22:553:46472:28:27:72:508:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school data alone is small. At SWCCS, the combination yields no additional improvement 
22:554:46559:27:28:72:297:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:beyond using high school information alone.24 
22:555:46604:28:28:108:519:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Holding remediation rates fixed as we compare alternative screening tools is a useful 
22:556:46690:28:27:72:526:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:benchmark, but it also limits the potential for major improvements particularly with respect to 
22:557:46786:27:28:72:524:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the severe under-placement rate. With remediation rates of 60 to 80 percent, it is possible that 
22:558:46883:28:27:72:537:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:many students might be under-placed regardless of what screening device is used to select them. 
22:559:46978:27:28:72:521:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Note that as the remediation rate approaches either 0 or 100 percent, the choice of screening 
22:560:47073:28:28:72:542:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:device is irrelevant.) In an extension below, we examine our validity metrics across the full range 
22:561:47173:28:27:72:312:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of possible diagnostic thresholds for remediation. 
22:562:47223:27:28:72:336:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B. Sensitivity analysis: excluding low-scoring students 
22:563:47278:28:27:108:511:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As noted above, one concern is that our underlying predictive models (expressed in 
22:564:47361:27:28:72:538:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equations 1a and 1b) may not extrapolate to students far below the current test score cut-offs. To 
22:565:47459:28:32:72:538:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:address this concern, we re-run the entire analysis with very low-scoring students excluded from 
22:566:47556:32:7:216:219:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
22:567:47604:7:16:72:536:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:24 In some cases, the combination actually appears to do marginally worse than using high school data alone, which 
22:568:47718:16:0:72:249:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:can result if test scores are extremely noisy. 
23:569:47766:0:28:72:536:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the sample.25 These restrictions exclude approximately 25 to 50 percent of test takers depending 
23:570:47862:28:28:72:214:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:upon the sample and subject. 
23:571:47890:28:27:108:540:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The results are presented in Table 3. We first note that there are some level shifts in these 
23:572:47984:27:28:72:537:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:validity metrics between Tables 2 and 3. For example, because we have explicitly excluded very 
23:573:48079:28:27:72:539:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:low-scorers, the remediation rates under current policy for these restricted samples are uniformly 
23:574:48178:27:28:72:517:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lower than those in Table 2. For the same reason, over-placement rates are higher and under-
23:575:48270:28:28:72:537:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placement rates generally lower after low-scorers are excluded, although the overall severe error 
23:576:48368:28:27:72:200:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates remain very similar.  
23:577:48395:27:28:108:523:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Overall, throwing out these low-scorers does little to alter the pattern of findings from 
23:578:48485:28:27:72:511:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 2. Using high school achievement measures instead of test scores still improves both 
23:579:48576:27:28:72:523:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:overall error rates and college-level success rates. And it is still the case that combining these 
23:580:48675:28:28:72:540:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:two types of measures generates the best results in math at LUCCS, but for all other samples and 
23:581:48771:28:39:72:545:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subjects the combination provides little added value above using high school achievement alone.   
23:582:48865:39:31:72:460:338:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C. Do Alternative Screening Tools Have Disparate Impacts by Gender or Race? 
23:583:48938:31:27:108:508:307:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Even if high school transcript-based assignments are more accurate than test-based 
23:584:49021:27:28:72:526:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assignments on average, one may worry that using high school transcripts might disadvantage 
23:585:49113:28:28:72:532:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some students relative to others, and we may be particularly concerned if performance on these 
23:586:49208:28:27:72:483:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:alternative measures varies systematically by race/ethnicity and/or gender. Autor and 
23:587:49294:27:28:72:519:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Scarborough (2008) examine the question of disparate impact in the context of job screening 
23:588:49386:28:37:72:528:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tests: while such screening tests may more accurately identify productive potential employees, 
23:589:49481:37:8:216:219:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
23:590:49529:8:16:72:532:124:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:25 For LUCCS: the math analysis excludes students scoring more than 10 points below the current test score cutoff 
23:591:49642:16:11:72:521:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:on either of the two math test modules. English analysis excludes students scoring more than 3 points below the 
23:592:49754:11:12:72:534:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:current writing test score cutoff or 10 points below the current reading test score cutoff. For SWCCS: the math and 
23:593:49867:12:11:72:528:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:English analysis excludes students scoring more than 10 points below the current test score cutoff on either of the 
23:594:49983:11:0:72:246:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:math or English test modules, respectively. 
24:595:50028:0:28:72:536:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they may also alter the racial composition of resulting hires. They demonstrate theoretically that 
24:596:50127:28:28:72:482:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:groups with lower average test performance are not necessarily disadvantaged by the 
24:597:50211:28:27:72:530:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:introduction of a test, if the alternative screening practices (e.g., managerial discretion) already 
24:598:50312:27:28:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:take these average group differences into account. They then show that the introduction of job 
24:599:50407:28:27:72:509:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening tests at a large retail firm resulted in more productive hires without changing the 
24:600:50501:27:28:72:212:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proportion of minority hires. 
24:601:50530:28:28:108:526:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the spirit of Autor and Scarborough, we examine our validity metrics by gender and 
24:602:50616:28:27:72:522:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:racial/ethnic identity for evidence of disparate impacts under alternative assignment rules. As 
24:603:50711:27:28:72:513:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with job screening tests, there is potentially an equality-efficiency trade-off in the choice of 
24:604:50808:28:27:72:508:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial screening tools if one tool is more accurate but as a result more minorities and/or 
24:605:50901:27:28:72:534:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:females are placed in remediation.26 Note that while we include gender and race/ethnicity in the 
24:606:50997:28:28:72:528:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:underlying model predicting college-level outcomes (described above in equations 1a and 1b), 
24:607:51090:28:27:72:542:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we assume that these demographic factors cannot be used in any assignment rule. Thus, while we 
24:608:51185:27:28:72:538:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:establish our cutoffs for the high school index and test-plus-high-school index at levels that keep 
24:609:51285:28:27:72:492:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the overall remediation rate fixed, the rate among any particular subgroup may change. 
24:610:51371:27:28:108:540:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We present the results by gender in Table 4.27 The first thing to note is that the pattern we 
24:611:51464:28:28:72:535:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found in Tables 2 and 3 holds within each gender subgroup as well: using high school transcript 
24:612:51559:28:27:72:534:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:data instead of test scores for placement would reduce the severe error rate and increase college-
24:613:51655:27:28:72:487:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level success rates for all subjects and samples; combining test scores and high school 
24:614:51743:28:29:72:518:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information would lead to additional incremental improvements in LUCCS math placement. 
24:615:51829:29:8:216:219:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
24:616:51877:8:16:72:538:147:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:26 There are two differences with our context, however: first, in our setting, the test-score-based policy is the default 
24:617:51998:16:11:72:523:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:already in place, and we examine replacing or augmenting this with additional quantitative, externally verifiable 
24:618:52112:11:12:72:506:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:measures (as opposed to a version of managerial discretion). Second, since 85 percent of LUCCS testers are 
24:619:52219:12:11:72:537:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:minorities (with roughly 30% black, 34% Hispanic, and 10% Asian), any disparate impacts are likely to be between 
24:620:52332:11:7:72:367:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:minority groups rather than between minorities and non-Hispanic whites. 
24:621:52403:7:16:72:529:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:27 For brevity, we show only the LUCCS COMPASS® and SWCCS ACCUPLACER® results to demonstrate the 
24:622:52499:16:0:72:486:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:consistency across samples/exams. The patterns for the SWCCS COMPASS® sample are very similar. 
25:623:52595:0:28:108:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Nonetheless, there is some evidence of disparate impacts, in the direction that one might 
25:624:52685:28:28:72:529:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:anticipate. Using high school information instead of test scores has the effect of decreasing the 
25:625:52783:28:27:72:524:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remediation rate for women but increasing it for men, for both SWCCS and LUCCS samples. 
25:626:52871:27:28:72:514:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This reinforces findings from prior research that men tend to do better on standardized tests 
25:627:52965:28:27:72:427:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:while women tend to earn higher grades (see Hedges and Nowell, 1995).  
25:628:53035:27:28:108:538:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Thus even while high school transcript information may be more accurate for students of 
25:629:53123:28:28:72:541:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:both genders, some may object to a policy change that impacts men and women differentially. At 
25:630:53218:28:27:72:543:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:least at LUCCS, using the combined test-plus-high-school index for remedial assignment appears 
25:631:53313:27:28:72:528:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to be a win-win situation for both genders relative to the current test-score based policy. Using 
25:632:53410:28:27:72:514:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the combined index for assignment would not raise the remediation rate for either subgroup 
25:633:53499:27:28:72:533:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relative to current policy, but would lower both over- and under-placements for both genders in 
25:634:53593:28:28:72:533:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:both subjects, and would noticeably increase success rates for those placed directly into college-
25:635:53689:28:27:72:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level work.28 At SWCCS, using the combined measure moderates, but does not eliminate, the 
25:636:53774:27:28:72:308:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disparate impact on remediation rates by gender. 
25:637:53822:28:27:108:519:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 5 performs the same analysis by race/ethnicity, focusing on LUCCS which has 
25:638:53903:27:28:72:512:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sufficiently large sample sizes within each subgroup. Again, we find that using high school 
25:639:53993:28:28:72:539:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information in combination with test scores maintains or reduces severe error rates and increases 
25:640:54091:28:27:72:506:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college-level success rates for all racial groups across all subjects. Even using high school 
25:641:54185:27:28:72:523:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information alone would reduce severe error rates for all groups and subjects except blacks in 
25:642:54279:28:27:72:536:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:English and Asians in math. Again, however, we find that these improvements in accuracy must 
25:643:54371:27:28:72:517:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be weighed against some disparate impacts on remediation rates. In math, using high school 
25:644:54462:28:20:72:539:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information alone versus test scores alone lowers the remediation rate for Hispanic students by 7 
25:645:54558:20:8:216:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
25:646:54606:8:16:72:519:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:28 This slight decline in the remediation rate when using alternative assignment rules is also reflected in the full 
25:647:54722:16:11:72:529:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:sample results in Table 3; it reflects the fact that we cannot set the cutoff at a point that will precisely preserve the 
25:648:54844:11:0:72:360:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:original 76.1 percent remediation rate in math and 80.5 rate in English.  
26:649:54919:0:28:72:511:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percentage points and increases it for Asian students by 10 percentage points, though these 
26:650:55009:28:28:72:520:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes are moderated by using the combined measure for placement. In English, using high 
26:651:55098:28:27:72:532:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school information alone would increase the remediation rate by 11 percentage points for black 
26:652:55192:27:28:72:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students and reduce it for Asian students by nearly 25 percentage points relative to the current 
26:653:55285:28:27:72:538:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test-based policy. These changes in English could be moderated by using the combined test-plus-
26:654:55379:27:28:72:319:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:high-school measure, but would still remain large.  
26:655:55430:28:28:108:532:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 6 applies the subgroup results from Tables 4 and 5 to simulate class compositions 
26:656:55515:28:27:72:516:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:at LUCCS under our alternative screening devices. If high school information were used for 
26:657:55606:27:28:72:511:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:screening instead of test scores, college-level math classes would have substantially higher 
26:658:55697:28:27:72:513:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:proportions of female and Hispanic students; on the other hand, representation of black and 
26:659:55788:27:28:72:537:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Asian students would fall. In college-level English, switching to high school achievement would 
26:660:55883:28:28:72:538:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not change the gender composition, but representation of black students would fall by half (from 
26:661:55980:28:27:72:511:377:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:31 to 15 percent) and Asian students’ representation would more than double (from 8 to 23 
26:662:56070:27:28:72:517:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent). These compositional changes are moderated, but not eliminated, when a combined 
26:663:56157:28:39:72:434:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:measure of test scores and high school achievement is used for placement.  
26:664:56231:39:31:72:418:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:D. Optimal Cutoffs: Trading Off Under-placement and Over-placement 
26:665:56296:31:28:108:504:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:So far, we have presented results that compare alternative screening devices while 
26:666:56378:28:27:72:534:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:holding the overall percentage of students remediated fixed at current levels. But in considering 
26:667:56476:27:28:72:515:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the optimal screening policy, the diagnostic threshold can be allowed to vary along with the 
26:668:56569:28:27:72:487:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instrument used, allowing for greater potential improvements in accuracy. For a given 
26:669:56655:27:28:72:538:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instrument, if policymakers weight over-placement and under-placement errors equally, then the 
26:670:56750:28:0:72:489:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:optimal instrument and cutoff can be chosen to minimize the overall severe error rate.  
27:671:56839:0:28:108:504:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figure 3 (panel A) shows the overall severe error rates, under-placement and over-
27:672:56921:28:28:72:528:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placement rates for math using alternative screening instruments with the LUCCS data. As the 
27:673:57014:28:27:72:538:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percentile cutoff increases, increasing proportions of students are assigned to remediation and so 
27:674:57113:27:28:72:517:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:under-placement rates grow sharply and over-placement rates fall. Error rates for alternative 
27:675:57207:28:27:72:540:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instruments must converge at both the high and low end of the potential cutoff range when either 
27:676:57304:27:28:72:531:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:no students or all students are assigned to remediation (in our figures this is complicated by the 
27:677:57403:28:28:72:532:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fact that the current test-only placement rule is actually based upon two sub-scores, only one of 
27:678:57501:28:27:72:538:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which we allow to vary here—we hold the easier pre-algebra test cutoff fixed at its current level, 
27:679:57600:27:28:72:405:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which matters only at the very low range of algebra cutoff scores).29  
27:680:57669:28:27:108:527:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Except for very low cutoffs, the SERs using test scores alone are higher than under the 
27:681:57757:27:28:72:531:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:alternative instruments we simulate. Using high school achievement alone or in addition to test 
27:682:57853:28:28:72:499:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scores reduces SERs most noticeably for cutoffs between the 50th and 80th percentiles. If 
27:683:57941:28:27:72:539:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policymakers cared only about the SER, the optimal policy would be to assign students based on 
27:684:58036:27:28:72:531:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the combined test-plus-high-school-achievement index with a cutoff at the 65th percentile. This 
27:685:58131:28:27:72:536:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy would reduce the SER by 3.1 percentage points (13 percent) while slightly improving the 
27:686:58226:27:28:72:517:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:success rate among those placed into college-level (shown in panel B), but perhaps the most 
27:687:58317:28:28:72:536:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:notable difference is that it would achieve these outcomes with a remediation rate 10 percentage 
27:688:58414:28:27:72:300:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:points lower than the rate under current policy. 
27:689:58461:27:28:108:529:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Interestingly, current policy at LUCCS—indicated by the large gray circular marker on 
27:690:58547:28:27:72:504:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the test-only line—appears to be at an SER-minimizing level for the test-only instrument; 
27:691:58637:27:28:72:536:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:however, the test-only SER line is relatively flat around the current cutoff, with cutoffs from the 
27:692:58737:28:20:72:506:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:55th to the 85th percentile all generating SERs in the range of 24 to 25 percent. Since these 
27:693:58829:20:8:216:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                 
27:694:58877:8:16:72:524:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:29 Because we hold the pre-algebra cutoff fixed, even with a very low algebra cutoff high proportions of students 
27:695:58990:16:11:72:541:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:will be assigned to remediation, which tends to increase under-placements but limits over-placements, as reflected in 
27:696:59108:11:0:72:110:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Figure 3. 
28:697:59119:0:28:72:531:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percentile cutoffs roughly correspond to remediation rates (this correspondence is exact for our 
28:698:59216:28:28:72:524:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:two alternative instruments, which are one-dimensional indices), this implies that a very wide 
28:699:59310:28:27:72:388:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:range of remediation rates can generate similar severe error rates. 
28:700:59377:27:28:108:534:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We perform a similar analysis in Figure 4 for LUCCS English, examining error rates for 
28:701:59464:28:27:72:507:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a range of cutoffs on the current writing test (holding the reading test cutoff fixed) and for 
28:702:59559:27:28:72:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding cutoffs on alternative instruments. Here, utilizing the high school achievement 
28:703:59653:28:28:72:512:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:index with a cutoff at just the 35th percentile could reduce remediation rates from nearly 80 
28:704:59745:28:27:72:504:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent to 35 percent while also reducing the SER by 9 percentage points and holding the 
28:705:59834:27:28:72:525:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college-level success rate essentially flat. Moreover, the figure indicates that given the current 
28:706:59933:28:27:72:535:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test-score based instrument, the SER minimizing policy would be to admit virtually everyone to 
28:707:60028:27:28:72:431:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college level (though the SER is flat between the 5th and 35th percentiles).  
28:708:60103:28:28:108:506:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We find similar patterns using the SWCCS data applied to both tests, illustrated in 
28:709:60187:28:27:72:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Figures 5 and 6. The SERs using a high school achievement measures alone are always lower 
28:710:60277:27:28:72:540:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than those using test scores alone; at SWCCS the combined assignment rule yields SERs that are 
28:711:60372:28:27:72:533:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:virtually identical to those just using high school achievement. Given that schools are using test 
28:712:60470:27:28:72:518:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:scores alone, the current cutoff in math appears near an SER-minimizing point (though as in 
28:713:60562:28:28:72:540:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:LUCCS, the SER curve is nearly flat for a wide range of cutoffs) while in English the SER could 
28:714:60658:28:27:72:474:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be lowered relative to current levels by simply admitting everyone to college-level. 
28:715:60741:27:28:108:538:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Institutions’ choice of cutoff can reveal information about how they perceive the costs of 
28:716:60832:28:27:72:535:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:different types of assignment errors. In math, the test-score-only SER is flat across a wide range 
28:717:60930:27:28:72:529:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of cutoffs, but both systems choose a cutoff near the top of this range; in English, both systems 
28:718:61028:28:28:72:526:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:choose a cutoff higher than the SER-minimizing level. This suggests that institutions perceive 
28:719:61123:28:0:72:501:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the costs of over-placement to be significantly higher than the costs of under-placement.  
29:720:61215:0:27:72:146:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:V. Discussion  
29:721:61229:27:28:108:539:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Our results underscore the reality that it is difficult to predict who will succeed in college 
29:722:61324:28:27:72:538:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by any means: regardless of the screening tool we examine, one-fifth to one-third of students are 
29:723:61422:27:28:72:541:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:likely to be severely mis-placed. Yet among a set of feasible, if imperfect screening devices, high 
29:724:61522:28:27:72:530:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school transcript information is at least as useful as and often superior to placement test scores. 
29:725:61619:27:28:72:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In both math and English, using high school GPA/units alone as a placement screen results in 
29:726:61711:28:28:72:530:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fewer severe placement mistakes than using test scores alone (with error reductions of 12 to 30 
29:727:61806:28:27:72:495:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent relative to test scores, in all samples/subjects except LUCCS math). There is no 
29:728:61894:27:28:72:529:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assignment trade-off: both under-placement and over-placement errors can be reduced, and the 
29:729:61987:28:27:72:512:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:success rate in college-level courses increased, without changing the proportion of students 
29:730:62080:27:28:72:530:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:assigned to remediation. At LUCCS, these errors are further reduced when placement tests and 
29:731:62171:28:28:72:532:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:high school information are used in combination, while at SWCCS we find that placement tests 
29:732:62264:28:27:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have little incremental value if high school information is already available. Our results are not 
29:733:62362:27:28:72:540:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:driven by the predicted outcomes for very low scoring students (for whom our model relies more 
29:734:62457:28:27:72:531:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heavily on extrapolation); the pattern of findings holds even when these students are excluded.  
29:735:62553:27:28:108:510:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:One potential explanation for the limited utility of placement exams is that they are 
29:736:62639:28:28:72:529:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:simply quite short (taking just 20-30 minutes per module) and thus very noisy, as noted above. 
29:737:62732:28:27:72:534:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Another possible factor may be a disconnect between the limited range of material tested on the 
29:738:62828:27:28:72:520:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exam and the material required to succeed in the typical first college-level course (Jaggars & 
29:739:62922:28:27:72:515:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Hodara, 2011). For example, ACT, Inc.’s own (2006) analysis suggests that the COMPASS 
29:740:63007:27:28:72:479:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:algebra exam is more accurate for predictions of success in “college algebra” versus 
29:741:63091:28:28:72:529:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:“intermediate algebra,” but many students meet their college-level math requirement by taking 
29:742:63185:28:0:72:535:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:courses that are not primarily algebra-based, such as introductory statistics. In comparison, high 
30:743:63285:0:28:72:508:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school transcript information may be both less noisy (because it is accumulated over years 
30:744:63375:28:28:72:525:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instead of minutes), and may capture broader dimensions of college readiness, such as student 
30:745:63468:28:27:72:183:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effort and motivation.  
30:746:63491:27:28:108:509:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Compared with current test-score based policies, using high school information for 
30:747:63574:28:27:72:509:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remedial assignment not only reduces severe placement errors overall but also within each 
30:748:63664:27:28:72:500:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:racial/ethnic and gender subgroup we examine. Despite these universal improvements in 
30:749:63749:28:28:72:541:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accuracy, some subgroups in some subjects do better on the tests while others do better on a high 
30:750:63847:28:27:72:538:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:school achievement index—meaning that the choice of screening device has implications for the 
30:751:63939:27:28:72:527:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gender and racial/ethnic composition of college-level courses. For example, if the remediation 
30:752:64034:28:27:72:522:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate is held fixed, then switching to assignment based on high school information only would 
30:753:64127:27:28:72:540:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increase the representation of women and Hispanics in college-level math at the expense of men, 
30:754:64222:28:28:72:539:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:black and Asian students; while in college-level math the switch would dramatically increase the 
30:755:64319:28:27:72:503:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:representation of Asian students while lowering representation of black students. Using a 
30:756:64409:27:28:72:527:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:combined measure for placement could moderate the disparate impacts of this potential policy 
30:757:64502:28:27:72:535:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shift. An alternative approach to addressing these disparate impacts would be to use high school 
30:758:64599:27:28:72:528:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information but lower the cutoffs such that no subgroup would face a higher remediation rate.  
30:759:64693:28:28:108:514:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Our findings provide new insights regarding how institutions weigh over-placement 
30:760:64775:28:27:72:533:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:errors versus under-placement errors. While the over-placement problem—students admitted to 
30:761:64867:27:28:72:539:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:college-level courses even though they end up failing there—is well known and much discussed, 
30:762:64961:28:27:72:534:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we find that severe under-placements are actually far more common. Our estimates suggest that 
30:763:65055:27:28:72:534:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one-quarter to one-third of students assigned to remediation could have earned a B or better had 
30:764:65152:28:28:72:529:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they been admitted directly to college-level work. Moreover, we find evidence that institutions 
30:765:65248:28:0:72:525:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could substantially lower their remediation rates without increasing the severe error rate. That 
31:766:65346:0:28:72:497:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they have not done so—in fact LUCCS has increased its cutoffs recently—suggests that 
31:767:65431:28:28:72:514:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:institutions are more concerned about minimizing over-placements than under-placements.  
31:768:65519:28:27:108:534:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This may be because the costs of over-placement fall not just on the over-placed student 
31:769:65607:27:28:72:496:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(who may be discouraged and/or risk losing financial aid eligibility), but also on faculty 
31:770:65696:28:27:72:519:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:members who dislike having to fail students, as well as on other students in the college-level 
31:771:65791:27:28:72:537:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:course who may experience negative peer effects. The costs of under-placement, in contrast, fall 
31:772:65888:28:28:72:507:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:primarily on the institution and the under-placed student. Moreover, over-placements may 
31:773:65976:28:27:72:538:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:simply be easier to observe: it is straightforward to document how many students are placed into 
31:774:66072:27:28:72:522:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a college-level course fails there, while under-placements can only be estimated statistically.  
31:775:66167:28:27:108:534:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The apparently greater weight given to over-placements also appears consistent with the 
31:776:66255:27:28:72:530:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial incentives of colleges. These incentives depend on the cross-subsidy (revenues minus 
31:777:66347:28:28:72:518:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs) between remedial and college-level courses. In most states, revenues through state aid 
31:778:66440:28:27:72:536:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formulas are equal across remedial and college-level courses, although for six states the funding 
31:779:66538:27:28:72:539:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formula is more generous for remedial courses (in only three states it is less generous). Very few 
31:780:66636:28:27:72:539:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:states provide data on the costs of remedial courses specifically, although these courses are more 
31:781:66734:27:28:72:521:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:often taught by lower paid faculty and use limited technology. However, data for Ohio’s two-
31:782:66826:28:28:72:534:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:year colleges shows that remedial courses cost 9% less than college-level courses. It thus seems 
31:783:66923:28:27:72:531:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:quite possible that remedial courses subsidize college-level courses, giving colleges an implicit 
31:784:67019:27:28:72:535:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incentive to under-place students.30 If so, colleges may face a financial constraint if remediation 
31:785:67118:28:27:72:364:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates are reduced without any additional resources provided. 
31:786:67177:27:28:108:517:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, our findings have implications for the interpretation of prior estimates of the 
31:787:67266:28:32:72:529:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact of remedial assignment, which are largely based upon regression discontinuity designs. 
31:788:67360:32:7:216:219:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:

32:791:67609:0:28:72:540:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:First, the relatively low predictive validity of placement exam scores (the running variable in RD 
32:792:67708:28:28:72:540:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:studies) suggests that RD estimates may generalize beyond just students scoring near the cutoffs. 
32:793:67806:28:27:72:504:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This is an important conclusion, since a common critique of prior null-to-negative impact 
32:794:67896:27:28:72:515:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimates has been that these estimates are local to students scoring near the cutoff, and that 
32:795:67992:28:27:72:533:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:students well below the cutoff may experience more positive effects. On the other hand, even if 
32:796:68088:27:28:72:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test scores were as good as random—meaning that the existing null-to-negative RD estimates 
32:797:68179:28:28:72:531:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could be interpreted as global average treatment effects—this would not rule out the possibility 
32:798:68276:28:27:72:522:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of heterogeneity in treatment effects. It may simply be that treatment effects vary along some 
32:799:68371:27:28:72:525:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dimension other than test scores. Indeed, Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez (2012) provide evidence 
32:800:68463:28:27:72:499:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:using LUCCS data that RD estimates of the impact of remediation are more negative for 
32:801:68549:27:28:72:522:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:subgroups identified as low-risk on the basis of high school transcript data.  It is possible that 
32:802:68648:28:28:72:540:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there are positive impacts of remediation for some subset of students who are underprepared, but 
32:803:68743:28:27:72:534:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that current test-based assignment policies simply catch too many prepared students in a widely-
32:804:68839:27:0:72:156:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cast remedial net.

37:965:76698:13:13:80:513:372:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:success in the college-level course. The vertical line indicates a hypothetical cutoff for remedial assignment. 
37:966:76810:13:12:80:516:359:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Students scoring at this hypothetical cutoff have a 45% chance of earning a B or better in college-level math,

37:968:77029:13:13:80:524:334:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:students will be severely underplaced; if placed in college-level then 1-74=26% of students with this score will

38:979:77591:13:12:87:514:174:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:Notes: Test-only results are based on varying the algebra test cutoff while the pre-algebra cutoff is fixed at the 
38:980:77706:12:12:87:527:162:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:current cuoff of 30. Allowing the pre-algebra cutoff to vary as well makes little difference for these results except 
38:981:77824:12:13:87:529:150:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:for algebra cutoffs below the 50th percentile. The fixed pre-algebra cutoff explains why the test-only results begin 
38:982:77941:13:12:87:508:137:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:to diverge sharply from the HS-only and Test+HS results for lower simulated algebra cutoffs: even when the 
38:983:78048:12:12:87:525:125:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:algebra cutoff is very low, the fixed pre-algebra cutoff will continue to assign students to remediation, increasing 
38:984:78165:12:13:87:510:113:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:underplacements but decreasing overplacements relative to  HS-only and Test+HS models with similarly low 
38:985:78270:13:0:87:292:100:9:Times New Roman:9:Times New Roman:cutoffs. *Gray dot indicates simulated current policy.
