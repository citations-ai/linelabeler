2:28:1338:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:D:A  growing  literature  argues  that  early  environments  affecting  childhood  health  may  influence 
2:29:1442:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:D:significantly later-life   health   and   financial   wellbeing.   We   present   new   evidence   on   the 
2:30:1549:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:D:relationship  between  child health  and  later-life  outcomes  using  variation  in  infant  mortality  in 
2:31:1656:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:D:England  and  Wales  at  the  onset of  World  War  II.  Using  data  from  the  British  Household  Panel 
2:32:1762:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:D:Survey, we exploit the variation in infant mortality across birth cohorts and region to estimate the 
2:33:1862:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:D:associations between infant mortality and adult outcomes such as disability and employment. Our 
2:34:1957:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:D:findings  suggest  that  higher  infant  mortality is  significantly  associated  with  higher  likelihood  of 
2:35:2067:14:42:72:410:490:12:Times:12:Times:D:disability, a lower probability of employment, and less earned income.

3:56:2635:0:13:72:140:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Introduction 
3:57:2647:13:14:72:75:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:58:2647:14:28:108:511:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:A growing literature argues that early environments affecting childhood health may 
3:59:2730:28:27:72:530:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:influence significantly adult health and socioeconomic status (Almond and Currie 2011). If so, 
3:60:2824:27:28:72:535:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:then investments in early childhood health may have particularly large returns and public policy 
3:61:2921:28:27:72:536:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:targeted at infant and child health should be encouraged, particularly when private investment is 
3:62:3019:27:28:72:539:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:constrained, for example, among low-income families. In addition, if childhood health does have 
3:63:3115:28:28:72:511:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a lasting effect, then associations between adult socioeconomic status and adult health may 
3:64:3207:28:27:72:538:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overstate the importance of socioeconomic status because child health may have influenced both 
3:65:3302:27:28:72:178:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these adult outcomes. 
3:66:3323:28:27:108:530:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Several studies have assessed the hypothesis of whether childhood health environments 
3:67:3408:27:28:72:520:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have lasting effects. Barker and Osmond (1986) and Ben-Shlomo and Smith (1991) obtained 
3:68:3494:28:28:72:534:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:associations between infant mortality and adult cause of death for birth cohorts born in England 
3:69:3591:28:27:72:533:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While both studies found some evidence that 
3:70:3686:27:28:72:541:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:higher rates of infant mortality were associated with higher rates of death, particularly from heart 
3:71:3787:28:27:72:512:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disease, associations were not consistent and adjusting for socioeconomic status eliminated 
3:72:3878:27:28:72:530:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant associations (Ben-Shlomo and Smith 1991). Similar studies using 19th century birth 
3:73:3971:28:28:72:522:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cohorts from countries other than England and Wales generally found evidence of scarring— 
3:74:4060:28:27:72:540:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth cohorts that experienced relatively high rates of infant mortality experienced relatively high 
3:75:4161:27:28:72:539:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rates of adult mortality (Bengtsson and Lindstrom 2000; Catalano and Bruckner 2006; Crimmins 
3:76:4253:28:27:72:535:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Finch 2006; Bengtsson and Broström 2009; Myrskylä 2010; Schellekens and Poppel 2016). 
3:77:4342:27:28:72:503:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Studies of more recent birth cohorts by Bozzoli et al. (2009) and Case and Paxson (2009) 
3:78:4428:28:28:72:528:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported similar findings. Case and Paxson (2009) reported that infant mortality was positively 
3:79:4523:28:0:72:530:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:associated with infectious disease and cognitive decline in adulthood, and Bozzoli et al. (2009) 
4:80:4618:0:28:72:535:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:found that infant (post-natal) mortality was negatively associated with adult height. A limitation 
4:81:4717:28:28:72:540:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the studies just described is that they do not exploit plausibly exogenous variation in early-life 
4:82:4819:28:27:72:520:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conditions.1 Therefore, it is unclear whether the associations obtained are causal. In addition, 
4:83:4915:27:28:72:541:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:most of these studies examining the lasting impact of child health used samples of people born in 
4:84:5012:28:27:72:530:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the late 19th and early 20th centuries and results may not generalize to birth cohorts alive today. 
4:85:5109:27:28:108:519:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There are several studies that exploit more plausibly exogenous variation in early life 
4:86:5197:28:28:72:528:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(i.e., in utero or infancy) health conditions, for example, Almond (2006) who studied the 1918 
4:87:5291:28:27:72:535:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:flu pandemic, and Bleakley (2007, 2010) and Lucas (2010) who studied eradicating malaria and 
4:88:5381:27:28:72:532:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hookworm.2 These studies, and many quasi-experimental studies focused on famines, generally 
4:89:5470:28:27:72:479:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:find evidence that early life health shocks are associated with worse adult health and 
4:90:5557:27:28:72:530:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:socioeconomic status, which is consistent with a scarring effect of early life health conditions.3 
4:91:5655:28:28:72:508:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However, findings from these quasi-experimental studies are not uniform, as a few studies 
4:92:5745:28:27:72:540:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported no significant association between early health shocks and adult outcomes (e.g., Stanner 
4:93:5843:27:28:72:480:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:et al. 1997; and Kannisto et al. 1997; Lumey et al. 2011; Brown and Thomas 2013).  
4:94:5920:28:27:108:496:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We present new evidence on the relationship between infant health and later-life 
4:95:6001:27:28:72:513:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes using plausibly exogenous variation in infant mortality in England at the onset of 
4:96:6093:28:28:72:521:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:World War II. Three contributions of our research are that we focus on relatively recent birth 
4:97:6185:28:27:72:515:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cohorts; we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in infant health; and we examine whether 
4:98:6276:27:34:72:536:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fertility responses mediate (confound) the effect of the infant health shock.4 In England between 
4:99:6373:34:9:72:219:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
4:100:6420:9:15:72:520:169:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:1 Some of these studies adjust for trends in mortality by birth cohort (Bengtsson and Lindstrom 2000; Myrskylä 
4:101:6530:15:8:72:100:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:2010). 
4:102:6536:8:15:72:517:146:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:2 There are several quasi-experimental studies that examine not health shocks, but the effect of early economic 
4:103:6647:15:7:72:511:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:environments on adult outcomes (e.g., Van de Berg et al. (2006); Cutler et al. (2007); Banerjee et al. (2010)).

4:107:7051:8:15:72:523:89:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:4 Our research is somewhat related to studies that have examined the long-term impact of childhood exposure to 
4:108:7161:15:0:72:533:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:warfare and armed conflict on adult outcomes (e.g., Akresh et al. (2012); Akbulut-Yuksel (2014); Kesternich et al. 
5:109:7277:0:28:72:522:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1939 and 1941, infant mortality rose 17 percent, although the increase is even larger than this 
5:110:7373:28:28:72:535:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:value implies because infant mortality was declining steadily during this period. The increase in 
5:111:7471:28:27:72:522:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality was largely driven by a marked increase in post-neonatal deaths mainly from 
5:112:7563:27:28:72:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pneumonia and whooping cough. Historical evidence indicates that the rise in infant mortality 
5:113:7657:28:27:72:534:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during this period was due to a combination of a wartime food rationing program and unusually 
5:114:7751:27:28:72:517:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:harsh winters. From 1942 onward, infant mortality fell back to its pre-1940 trend because of 
5:115:7842:28:28:72:527:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:priority rationing that favored pregnant women, less harsh winters, and improvement in health 
5:116:7936:28:27:72:293:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:services in childcare facilities (see Figure 1).  
5:117:7985:27:28:108:525:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Within England, the extent to which infant mortality increased varied markedly across 
5:118:8071:28:27:72:536:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions. For example, infant mortality in London changed little between 1939 and 1941 while in 
5:119:8166:27:28:72:517:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Northeast England it rose by nearly 27 percent. Because the negative health shock was short 
5:120:8258:28:28:72:493:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lived, severe, and varied within the country, it provides a natural opportunity to test the 
5:121:8350:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship between exposure to an adverse, early childhood health environment and later-life 
5:122:8445:27:28:72:124:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes. 
5:123:8454:28:27:108:520:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we exploit the variation in post-
5:124:8539:27:28:72:508:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:neonatal mortality across birth cohorts and regions to estimate associations between infant 
5:125:8631:28:28:72:541:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality and adult outcomes, such as presence of various health conditions, employment, earned 
5:126:8726:28:27:72:497:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:income, home ownership, and disability. Our findings suggest that the increase in infant 
5:127:8815:27:34:72:508:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality in the early 1940s is associated with worse health as an adult. Specifically, a one

5:131:9179:11:12:72:541:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:ground combat. However, these studies examined exposure to general war conditions including, poor nutrition, mass 
5:132:9293:12:11:72:536:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:dislocation, combat and destruction of the physical environment. Our study is different because we do not study the 
5:133:9409:11:12:72:536:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:effects of warfare, but the war-induced rise in infant mortality in 1940-41, which is a very specific exposure caused 
5:134:9527:12:11:72:521:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:by identifiable factors. Ground combat never occurred in the United Kingdom, and bombing and relocation was 
5:135:9634:11:12:72:504:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:focused mainly on London and a few port cities. The German bombing of London began at the end of 1940 
5:136:9736:12:11:72:532:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:subsequent to the initial spike in infant mortality observed in the data (see Figure 1). We describe the nature of the 
5:137:9855:11:0:72:340:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:exposure and the quasi-experimental design in more detail below.  
6:138:9921:0:28:72:531:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:standard deviation increase in infant mortality is associated with approximately a 39% increase 
6:139:10016:28:28:72:542:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in reporting a disability; a 17% decrease in the probability of having a job; and a 21% decrease in 
6:140:10116:28:27:72:533:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:annual real earned income. Notably, these effects manifest mainly in later life, particularly after 
6:141:10216:27:28:72:503:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:age 60. Another important finding of our study is that childhood socioeconomic status, as 
6:142:10306:28:27:72:467:598:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:measured by father’s occupation, does not moderate the effect of infant mortality. 
6:143:10388:27:28:108:111:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
6:144:10388:28:28:72:309:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Background: England and Wales in the 1940s 
6:145:10428:28:27:108:531:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Since the 1930s, infant mortality in England followed a marked downward trend except 
6:146:10513:27:28:72:541:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for 1940 and 1941, as shown in Figure 1. Between 1939 and 1942, infant deaths rose from 50 per 
6:147:10608:28:27:72:529:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:thousand in 1939 to 59 per thousand in 1941 and the dropped back to 49 per thousand in 1942. 
6:148:10701:27:28:72:508:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The deviation from trend in 1940 and 1941 is arguably the result of the interaction of food 
6:149:10793:28:28:72:515:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rationing policies, World War II, and the unusually harsh winters of 1940 and 1941, each of 
6:150:10885:28:27:72:199:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which we discuss in turn.  
6:151:10911:27:28:72:513:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The Ministry of Food was created in 1939 and was responsible for food distribution 
6:152:10994:28:27:72:529:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:during the war. Various rationing schemes were used including direct distribution of items and 
6:153:11089:27:28:72:516:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:allocations based on coupons and points for different foodstuffs. Food items including milk, 
6:154:11182:28:28:72:508:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:eggs, cereals, oranges, butter, bacon, sugar, meats, and cheeses were rationed beginning in 
6:155:11274:28:27:72:541:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:January of 1940 at the start of major wartime actions and rationing became increasingly stringent 
6:156:11372:27:28:72:537:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as the war went on. The daily rations provided approximately 910 calories, but little calcium and 
6:157:11470:28:27:72:542:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:vitamins. To protect the health of women with children and expectant mothers, the National Milk 
6:158:11566:27:28:72:538:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Scheme was started in June of 1940 and provided additional priority allowances, which supplied 
6:159:11661:28:28:72:508:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:an additional 540 calories and the bulk of their daily requirement of calcium and vitamins. 
6:160:11753:28:0:72:534:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However, initial take-up was low and the program did not witness significant uptake until 1942. 
7:161:11850:0:28:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f4:B:The priority allowance was later credited as having “done more than any other single factor to 
7:162:11945:28:28:72:512:681:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:promote the health of expectant mothers and young children during the war” (Great Britain 
7:163:12035:28:27:72:228:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ministry of Health 1946, p. 93). 
7:164:12067:27:28:108:517:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In addition to rationed food, in the fall of 1940 until the spring of 1941, England was 
7:165:12155:28:27:72:523:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:under assault from German bombing campaigns that targeted the more densely populated and 
7:166:12244:27:28:72:536:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:better developed areas of England such as London. From these areas, the government evacuated 
7:167:12337:28:28:72:538:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children and expectant mothers to rural areas in England (Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, 
7:168:12434:28:27:72:539:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:92). The evacuation caused shortages in supplies, staff, and accommodations in destination areas 
7:169:12531:27:28:72:512:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that could adversely affect the quality of infant and child healthcare. By 1940, England had 
7:170:12624:28:27:72:535:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developed day nurseries for displaced children and children of parents engaged in the war effort 
7:171:12720:27:28:72:497:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, p. 98). Initially, staying in the day nurseries was 
7:172:12812:28:28:72:542:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:associated with the transmission of infectious disease given close confinement of children, but by 
7:173:12911:28:27:72:540:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1942 the quality of the nurseries improved because of better staffing and more abundant supplies 
7:174:13008:27:28:72:532:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and resulted in a decrease in the incidence of disease (Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, p. 
7:175:13106:28:27:72:94:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:99). 
7:176:13110:27:28:108:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Furthermore, the 1939-40 and 1940-41 winters produced extremely low temperatures, 
7:177:13192:28:28:72:533:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extensive frosts, and large snows. The meteorological record from the period described January 
7:178:13287:28:27:72:521:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D:1940 as “exceptionally cold; intense frost; considerable snow in the latter half of the month”; 
7:179:13383:27:28:72:530:212:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D:January 1941 was described as “cold, with frequent snow” (“Monthly Weather Reports 1940s” 
7:180:13473:28:0:72:502:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2016).  The inclement weather of the period was not uniform across regions, however, as 
8:181:13562:0:28:72:522:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:England, despite being a relatively small country, has surprisingly diverse microclimates that 
8:182:13656:28:28:72:301:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exacerbate or buffer general weather patterns.5  
8:183:13703:28:27:108:537:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Table 1 displays infant mortality rates by cause between 1939 and 1942. The noteworthy 
8:184:13790:27:28:72:507:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contributions to the increase in mortality in 1940 and 1941 are bronchitis, pneumonia, and 
8:185:13881:28:27:72:502:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whooping cough. These illnesses account for 60% of the total increase in infant mortality 
8:186:13971:27:28:72:527:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between 1939 and 1941, and are conditions that are plausibly affected by inadequate nutrition, 
8:187:14065:28:28:72:493:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inclement weather, and wartime dislocation. For example, harsh winters, poor nutrition 
8:188:14150:28:27:72:511:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:combined with a lack of fuel products to heat homes (from the ration), and the crowding of 
8:189:14240:27:28:72:524:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children into day nurseries may have facilitated the transmission of pneumonia and whooping 
8:190:14329:28:27:72:491:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cough because of their infectious nature (Griffiths and Brock 2003). Moreover, several 
8:191:14415:27:28:72:536:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:researchers have linked pneumonia incidence to vitamin D deficiency (Muhe et al. 1997; Wayse 
8:192:14507:28:28:72:512:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:et al. 2004; McNally et al. 2009; Wonodi et al. 2012). Eggs are rich in vitamin D, and were 
8:193:14599:28:27:72:472:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:among the rationed food items that were particularly scarce in the early war years.  
8:194:14683:27:28:108:541:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Figure 2 displays the overall trend in neonatal and post-neonatal mortality in England and 
8:195:14774:28:27:72:508:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Wales from the period. Note that while overall neonatal mortality increases somewhat, the 
8:196:14864:27:28:72:539:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant deviation from trend occurs for post-neonatal mortality. To more closely focus on the 
8:197:14962:28:28:72:539:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:post-neonatal period, Appendix Figure 1 displays child mortality for children aged 1-2 and those 
8:198:15059:28:27:72:516:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:aged 3-5. Both groups experienced significant percentage increases in mortality in 1940 and 
8:199:15151:27:28:72:105:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1941.  
8:200:15157:28:27:108:527:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Notably, we also observe substantial variation in the magnitude of infant deaths within 
8:201:15245:27:48:72:527:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:England across regions. Generally, areas farthest from London experienced the greatest rise in

8:205:15527:11:0:72:98:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:2017) 
9:206:15533:0:28:72:541:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality. In Figure 3 we present the difference in infant mortality between observed value 
9:207:15632:28:28:72:533:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and a predicted linear trend by region. A value of zero indicates that infant mortality in a region 
9:208:15732:28:27:72:516:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is perfectly on trend. In 1940-41, there is a clear upward divergence from trend with regions 
9:209:15826:27:28:72:348:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:farthest from London experiencing the largest increases.  
9:210:15883:28:27:108:526:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To explore further the relationship between weather and infant mortality, we compiled 
9:211:15968:27:28:72:540:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:historic weather data from the UK meteorological office. 6 The data contain monthly measures of 
9:212:16061:28:28:72:503:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:average minimum temperatures which we use to illustrate the relationship between infant 
9:213:16148:28:27:72:516:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality and weather in Figure 4. The solid line represents deviations from a linear trend in 
9:214:16242:27:28:72:533:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality from 1931 to 1960. The dashed line represents deviations from a linear trend in 
9:215:16337:28:27:72:509:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the average minimum daily temperature in January of each year. The two measures appear 
9:216:16423:27:28:72:531:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inversely correlated, with mortality rising above trend when minimum temperatures fall below. 
9:217:16516:28:28:72:531:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Particularly salient is the sharp decline in minimum temperatures during 1940 and 1941, which 
9:218:16609:28:27:72:509:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coincide with sharp increases in mortality. Note too, that the increase in infant mortality in 
9:219:16703:27:28:72:505:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:response to the colder winters in 1940-41 is significantly larger than the increase in infant 
9:220:16797:28:27:72:492:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality corresponding to similarly a cold winter in 1945, which is consistent with the 
9:221:16884:27:28:72:492:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interaction between poor nutrition, poor conditions in day nurseries, and cold weather.  
9:222:16971:28:28:108:510:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The evidence from rationing and harsh winters is consistent with areas farther from 
9:223:17055:28:27:72:531:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:London experiencing a greater increase in infant mortality. More remote areas likely had fewer 
9:224:17150:27:28:72:531:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources and fewer rationed goods. Historical weather information suggests that the winters in 
9:225:17246:28:27:72:521:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the north of England were somewhat harsher than in the south, which also partly explains the 
9:226:17339:27:28:72:492:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:within-country variation. Appendix Figure 2 presents the difference in average January 
9:227:17426:28:32:72:540:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:temperatures between the observed value and a region-specific linear trend. The figure illustrates

9:230:17685:15:0:72:415:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:Only six of our ten regions are represented during the entire 1930 to 1960 timeframe. 
10:231:17771:0:28:72:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that the 1940/41 winters were particularly harsh across the UK, with the regions experiencing 
10:232:17865:28:28:72:541:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:January temperatures around three to six degrees below trend. Moreover, the predominately rural 
10:233:17961:28:27:72:535:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:areas where shelters were built to house expectant mothers were also away from London, which 
10:234:18054:27:28:72:385:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:would additionally explain part of the pattern in infant mortality. 
10:235:18121:28:27:108:518:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To summarize, Figures 1-4 and Table 1 document the circumstances surrounding the 
10:236:18202:27:28:72:504:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant spike in post-neonatal and early childhood mortality. The combination of food 
10:237:18292:28:28:72:535:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D:shortages, harsh weather, and disruption in children’s healthcare resulted in greater incidence of 
10:238:18391:28:27:72:532:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infectious, respiratory disease for young children in 1940 and 1941. Additionally, the incidence 
10:239:18487:27:28:72:524:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differed substantially by region within England. The variation in child health across both time 
10:240:18583:28:27:72:529:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and region, as measured by infant mortality, represents our measure of the exposure to adverse 
10:241:18678:27:28:72:542:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health shocks. These infant health shocks mainly reflect infectious disease, and, as Crimmins and 
10:242:18775:28:28:72:512:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Finch (2006) and others have articulated, there are plausible biological mechanisms linking 
10:243:18865:28:27:72:367:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infectious disease during infancy/childhood to adult disease.

10:248:19114:28:27:72:541:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:BHPS is a longitudinal survey of approximately 5,500 households in Britain from 1991 to 2009.7 
10:249:19208:27:28:72:518:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The survey is well suited for our study because respondents are asked their date and place of 
10:250:19302:28:27:72:527:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth, which we match with the Great Britain Historical Database to determine exposure to the 
10:251:19396:27:28:72:530:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health shock as an infant. The Great Britain Historical Database contains information on infant 
10:252:19492:28:43:72:369:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:deaths and births, as well as population by location and year.

11:255:19680:0:28:108:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The sample we use is limited to those born between 1935 and 1950, which is a period that 
11:256:19768:28:28:72:511:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spans the sharp rise in infant mortality, but is a relatively narrow window of time to reduce 
11:257:19862:28:27:72:524:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential confounding from economic and technological changes occurring during the period. 
11:258:19953:27:28:72:527:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:There are 52,348 person-by-wave observations for this sample. From the initial 52,348 person-
11:259:20046:28:27:72:527:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:waves selected, we drop 5,001 observations that are missing information for place of birth and 
11:260:20141:27:28:72:497:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:another 11,741 born in Scotland because there is no data available on infant mortality in 
11:261:20231:28:28:72:531:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Scotland. We drop two additional observations due to missing month of birth. Our final sample 
11:262:20324:28:27:72:398:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consists of 35,604 person-by-wave observations for 3,312 persons.  
11:263:20390:27:28:108:529:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The BHPS are longitudinal data covering an 18-year period. In our sample, the average 
11:264:20476:28:27:72:512:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individual is observed in approximately 10.75 waves of the survey. Our primary regression 
11:265:20564:27:28:72:533:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:approach uses all person-wave observations thereby treating each person-wave observation as a 
11:266:20656:28:28:72:506:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:separate observation. This is a reasonable approach because the outcomes we measure are 
11:267:20744:28:27:72:263:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changing over time as the person ages.  
11:268:20783:27:28:108:525:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We calculate infant mortality (IM) and birth rates by region and year.8 Infant mortality 
11:269:20871:28:28:72:512:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(퐼푀푖푟푐) is measured as a weighted average of infant mortality in the year of birth and in the 
11:270:20964:28:28:72:529:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following year, for example, because those born in January experience a different environment 
11:271:21058:28:28:72:362:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:than those born in December of the same year. Specifically: 
11:272:21116:28:29:221:394:238:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times New Roman:A:퐼푀푖푟푐=훼퐼푀푖푟푐+(1−훼)퐼푀푖푟,푐+1 
11:273:21142:29:28:72:533:209:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where birth-year mortality (퐼푀푖푟푐) and the following-year mortality (퐼푀푖푟,푐+1) are weighted (훼) 
11:274:21237:28:28:72:518:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by birth month. An individual born in January receives a weight of 1. The weight reduces by 
11:275:21328:28:30:72:526:153:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f6:B:1/12 for each additional month so that an individual born in February receives a weight of 훼=
11:276:21420:30:10:72:219:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
11:277:21467:10:16:72:520:113:8:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f4:D:8 Specifically, we use table “mort_lgd” which records “Birth & Death Statistics for Local Government Districts 
11:278:21577:16:12:72:516:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:from 1921-1974.” Although county-level information is available in both data sets, a significant number of the 
11:279:21688:12:11:72:539:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:counties of birth in the BHPS are not listed in the historical database, and therefore, we aggregate infant mortality to 
11:280:21809:11:0:72:379:74:10:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the region level; there are ten regions in total—nine in England plus Wales.  
12:281:21888:0:27:72:513:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:Times New Roman:B:0.916; March 훼=0.833; and so on. The approach places more weight on actual birth-year 
12:282:21974:27:28:72:533:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality for those born earlier in the year; for those born later in the year more weight is 
12:283:22075:28:28:72:519:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:placed on the subsequent year’s mortality. 퐼푀푖푟푐 is our measure of treatment, or exposure, to 
12:284:22167:28:28:72:524:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:adverse early health conditions.  We standardize infant mortality to have an overall mean of 0 
12:285:22260:28:27:72:529:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and standard deviation of 1. The standard deviation of infant mortality is 11.8, roughly the size 
12:286:22358:27:28:72:238:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the mortality shock in 1940/41. 
12:287:22392:28:28:108:509:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Survey respondents in the BHPS answer questions about their health including self-
12:288:22474:28:27:72:487:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported health status, presence of health problems, and disability status in addition to 
12:289:22564:27:28:72:524:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information about employment, income, and home ownership. For self-reported health status, 
12:290:22654:28:27:72:515:459:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:individuals are asked, “Please think back over the last 12 months about how your health has 
12:291:22746:27:28:72:520:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been. Compared to people of your own age, would you say that your health has on the whole 
12:292:22836:28:28:72:523:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:been” and they may check excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor from which we define two 
12:293:22927:28:27:72:541:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:indicators: an indicator for good or excellent health and an indicator for poor or very poor health. 
12:294:23028:27:28:72:506:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:For the presence of health problems, individuals are asked “Do you have any of the health 
12:295:23118:28:27:72:497:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D:problems or disabilities listed on this card?” which include thirteen conditions including 
12:296:23209:27:28:72:514:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problems with arms or legs, problems with chest or breathing, problems with heart or blood 
12:297:23300:28:28:72:524:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pressure, difficulty seeing, difficulty hearing, skin conditions, stomach/liver/kidney, diabetes, 
12:298:23398:28:27:72:499:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:nerves/anxiety/depression, alcohol/drugs, epilepsy, migraine/chronic headache, or other. 
12:299:23486:27:28:72:532:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Respondents could check any conditions that apply and our measure of any self-reported health 
12:300:23580:28:0:72:478:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problems is an indicator that equals one for those who suffer from at least one of the 
13:301:23669:0:28:72:481:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:aforementioned conditions. We also examine the top three most prevalent conditions 
13:302:23752:28:28:72:143:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individually.9  
13:303:23766:28:27:108:542:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:A:Our measure of disability status comes from the question “Can I check, are you registered 
13:304:23856:27:28:72:537:626:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f4:B:as a disabled person, either with Social Services or with a green card?” Those who check yes are 
13:305:23952:28:27:72:524:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:defined as disabled. Home ownership status is derived from a question that asks individuals if 
13:306:24047:27:28:72:533:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:they own a home or rent a home. We define an indicator for home ownership equal to one if the 
13:307:24141:28:28:72:523:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individual responds that they own their home outright or with a mortgage and zero otherwise. 
13:308:24234:28:27:72:539:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:We measure employment using a dichotomous measure that equals one if the respondent did any 
13:309:24326:27:28:72:527:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:paid work in the previous week and zero otherwise. Finally, respondents report annual income 
13:310:24419:28:27:72:230:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from labor (i.e., earned income). 
13:311:24452:27:28:108:518:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Respondents are also asked “Thinking back to when you were 14, what job was your 
13:312:24533:28:28:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:father doing at that time?” If working and not deceased, the father’s job title, nature of work, and 
13:313:24634:28:27:72:531:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industry were recorded and used to create several variables that measures the social class of the 
13:314:24731:27:28:72:464:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:father’s job. Occupations are grouped into the following categories: professional, 
13:315:24814:28:27:72:529:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:managerial/technical, skilled (manual/non-manual), partly-skilled, and unskilled. From this we 
13:316:24909:27:28:72:519:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:categorize respondents as growing up in a high (professional or managerial/technical) or low 
13:317:25002:28:28:72:425:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(remaining categories plus non-working/deceased) socioeconomic class.  
13:318:25071:28:27:108:537:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Table 2 reports descriptive statistics. On average, the sample is 56 years of age, although 
13:319:25162:27:28:72:533:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there is significant variation in age indicated by a standard deviation of 6.8 years. Slightly more 
13:320:25262:28:27:72:531:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the sample is female (54%), which is consistent with longer life expectancy of females vis-à-
13:321:25358:27:48:72:509:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:vis males. Figures related to our outcomes indicate that approximately 69% report a health 
13:322:25449:48:8:72:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
13:323:25496:8:16:72:518:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:9 Approximately 69% of our sample report suffering from one or more of the thirteen conditions. The top three 
13:324:25605:16:11:72:524:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:reported conditions include arm/leg problems (38%), heart/BP problems (23%), and chest or breathing problems 
13:325:25714:11:0:72:105:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:(13%).  
14:326:25723:0:28:72:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problem, although only 12% report being in poor or very poor health. The apparent discrepancy 
14:327:25817:28:28:72:514:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between the proportion being in poor health and the proportion with a health problem likely 
14:328:25909:28:27:72:514:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reflects the self-reported nature of the questions and the fact that many respondents report a 
14:329:26004:27:28:72:262:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health problem that is relatively minor. 
14:330:26044:28:27:72:206:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Measurement of Exposure 
14:331:26067:27:28:108:516:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Our measure of exposure, or treatment, is the infant mortality in the region and year, 
14:332:26154:28:28:72:531:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which is derived from administrative data. Given the wartime relocations, there is a question as 
14:333:26251:28:27:72:518:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to whether births and deaths were recorded consistently with respect to place of residence or 
14:334:26345:27:28:72:530:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:place of occurrence. The administrative data are quite clear that deaths were recorded based on 
14:335:26441:28:27:72:516:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:place of occurrence. However, it is possible that births might have been recorded at place of 
14:336:26535:27:28:72:504:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:permanent residence if relocation occurred soon after birth, but there were great efforts to 
14:337:26628:28:28:72:531:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relocate pregnant women which would minimize this possibility. For example, in 1939, 13,900 
14:338:26718:28:27:72:518:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pregnant women were relocated out of greater London (Johnson 1985). Consistent with this, 
14:339:26808:27:28:72:540:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:births in London fell by roughly 20,000 between 1939 and 1941 (Appendix Figure 3). Therefore, 
14:340:26902:28:27:72:525:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it is likely that most births were recorded in the place of occurrence and thus the extent of any 
14:341:27000:27:28:72:306:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:misreporting of births would appear to be small. 
14:342:27048:28:28:108:528:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:A second concern is measuring exposure for individuals who were relocated. Note that 
14:343:27133:28:27:72:536:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the adverse health shocks were manifest within the first year of life, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, 
14:344:27232:27:28:72:531:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality in the place of birth accurately reflects exposure for all those who stayed in the 
14:345:27332:28:27:72:535:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relocation region for several months, which is likely to be the vast majority of persons that were 
14:346:27431:27:28:72:499:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relocated.10 Exposure would be incorrectly assigned if survey respondents who had been 
14:347:27517:28:32:72:536:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relocated reported their birth region as their permanent residence rather than the actual region of 
14:348:27617:32:8:72:219:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
14:349:27664:8:15:72:535:89:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:10 However, for those who return to their permanent residence, some of the effect of exposure could be confounded 
14:350:27776:15:0:72:220:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:with their moving during childhood. 
15:351:27813:0:28:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth. To address this concern, given that most of the relocation is associated with London, we 
15:352:27909:28:28:72:540:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:re-estimate our regressions omitting survey respondents born in London. Our findings are largely 
15:353:28006:28:27:72:274:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unchanged when we omit London births.  
15:354:28044:27:28:72:75:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
15:355:28044:28:27:72:180:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Empirical Approach 
15:356:28062:27:28:108:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The hypothesis we are interested in assessing is whether exposure to a health shock in 
15:357:28149:28:28:72:530:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infancy affects adult outcomes. This hypothesis is motivated by two broad causal mechanisms. 
15:358:28242:28:27:72:537:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:The first is often referred to as “scarring” (Elo and Preston 1992). The scarring channel suggests 
15:359:28341:27:28:72:523:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that exposure to a negative health shock may adversely affect developing organs and immune 
15:360:28432:28:27:72:540:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:system (e.g., inflammation) and cause worse later-life health. For example, the observed increase 
15:361:28530:27:28:72:521:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in infectious disease during 1940-41 because of food rationing and harsh winters may lead to 
15:362:28623:28:28:72:527:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:worse later-life outcomes for those born during this period. A second mechanism linking early 
15:363:28717:28:27:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f4:12:Times New Roman:B:and late heath is often referred to as “culling.” The culling channel suggests that during exposure 
15:364:28817:27:28:72:532:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to an adverse health event the weakest children die leaving a healthier group of children. In this 
15:365:28915:28:27:72:331:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:case, early health shocks result in better adult health.  
15:366:28972:27:28:108:523:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Of course, these broad causal pathways are not mutually exclusive and which channel 
15:367:29055:28:28:72:532:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dominates is an empirical question. There may also be behavioral responses to the health shock 
15:368:29149:28:27:72:525:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in childhood. Parents may respond by investing in affected children and, as we discuss below, 
15:369:29243:27:28:72:491:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fertility may be affected by the health shock. Parental responses and their influence are 
15:370:29333:28:27:72:525:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:additional considerations relevant to the interpretation of estimates of the association between 
15:371:29430:27:28:72:533:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:child health and adult outcomes. Such behavioral responses may reinforce or offset the scarring 
15:372:29526:28:0:72:166:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and culling effects.

16:374:29577:27:28:108:505:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To estimate the effect of infant mortality on later-life outcomes, we use regression

16:394:30849:28:27:72:528:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1950. As Figure 3 showed, each region experienced different exposure to infant mortality, and 
16:395:30943:27:28:72:533:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by including the fixed effect, we compare outcomes within region. The birth cohort fixed effect

16:398:31179:8:16:72:398:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:11 We adjust annual labor income for inflation using the CPI index available here

16:400:31365:11:0:72:197:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:We use 2008 as the base year.  
17:401:31397:0:28:72:533:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such as changing medical technology and environmental conditions that account, partly, for the 
17:402:31492:28:28:72:520:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:downward trend in infant mortality experienced during this time. The survey age fixed effect 
17:403:31585:28:28:72:523:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(휆푎) accounts for any differences in age at the time of the survey (and any survey year effects 
17:404:31681:28:27:72:307:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because birth year plus age equals survey year).  
17:405:31730:27:28:108:533:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The identifying assumption of our approach is that, conditional on region, age, and birth 
17:406:31820:28:27:72:535:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:year fixed effects, variation in infant mortality is largely driven by exogenous factors associated 
17:407:31920:27:28:72:531:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the war such as food rationing and adverse weather conditions. In some specifications, we 
17:408:32013:28:28:72:479:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:include region-specific, linear birth-year trends and the results remain unchanged.12  
17:409:32097:28:27:72:531:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  To estimate equation (1), we use a linear probability model for dichotomous outcomes, 
17:410:32183:27:28:72:535:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but estimated effects are similar when using a logit model. In the case of earned income, we use 
17:411:32280:28:27:72:523:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a generalized linear model (GLM) specification with a Gaussian distribution assumption. The 
17:412:32372:27:28:72:519:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect of infant mortality as embodied in the coefficient β1 represents the consequences of an 
17:413:32466:28:28:72:239:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:adverse health shock early in life.  
17:414:32502:28:27:108:534:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As noted earlier in the description of the data, the sample includes multiple observations 
17:415:32593:27:28:72:540:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for each person, which raises three potential concerns: one related to the construction of standard 
17:416:32693:28:28:72:535:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:errors; another related to the timing of any effect (or age that an effect becomes manifest); and a 
17:417:32793:28:27:72:536:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:third related to possible bias from including different numbers of observations for individuals if, 
17:418:32893:27:28:72:347:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for example, survival is correlated with infant mortality.  
17:419:32952:28:27:72:509:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: With respect to standard errors, we used two methods: a cluster-robust method that 
17:420:33035:27:28:72:538:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assumes the errors are correlated (non-independent) within region-by-year of birth cells (i.e., the 
17:421:33135:28:47:72:535:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level of treatment), and randomization inference. Randomization inference relies on virtually no 
17:422:33232:47:8:72:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
17:423:33279:8:16:72:507:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:12 In a separate specification (available upon request) we also included a survey year linear trend, which had 
17:424:33389:16:11:72:527:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:virtually no effect on our estimates. Following Almond and Mazumder (2005), we also interacted age and survey 
17:425:33499:11:0:72:405:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:wave which also had virtually no effect on our estimates (available upon request).  
18:426:33584:0:28:72:540:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistical assumptions (Imbens and Rubin 2015). While we believe these methods are valid even 
18:427:33677:28:28:72:536:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the context of multiple observations per person, particularly randomization inference, we also 
18:428:33775:28:27:72:535:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:used an alternative. Specifically, we used cluster-robust methods that assume non-independence 
18:429:33870:27:28:72:522:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of errors within a person over time. Estimates from this alternative were very similar to those 
18:430:33965:28:27:72:227:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported (available on request).  
18:431:33998:27:28:108:528:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:With respect to the timing of any observed effects, we estimate a separate specification 
18:432:34087:28:28:72:533:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that allows the effect of exposure to vary by age. With respect to the possibility that using more 
18:433:34186:28:27:72:495:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:observations for some individuals and fewer for others may introduce bias, we obtained 
18:434:34272:27:28:72:541:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates using a sample consisting of one randomly selected observation for each person. In this 
18:435:34369:28:27:72:534:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:case, each individual contributes only one observation and the sample of unique persons has the 
18:436:34465:27:28:72:518:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same distribution of characteristics as the full sample that includes multiple observations per 
18:437:34561:28:28:72:509:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:person. Estimates from this sample address concerns over the standard errors and concerns 
18:438:34650:28:27:72:473:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related to potential bias from using more observations for some people than others. 
18:439:34733:27:28:72:258:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moderation by Socioeconomic Status 
18:440:34767:28:27:108:543:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:It is possible that family socioeconomic status during childhood could moderate effects of 
18:441:34857:27:28:72:539:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:early-life health shocks. For instance, even with a food ration in place, wealthier families may be 
18:442:34956:28:28:72:528:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:able to obtain more food through alternative channels, which would tend to lessen any adverse 
18:443:35048:28:27:72:531:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect. To explore this possibility, we estimate a model that allows the effect of infant mortality 
18:444:35147:27:28:72:538:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to differ by socioeconomic status, as measured by indicators for whether your father worked in a 
18:445:35244:28:27:72:530:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lower (unskilled, partly-skilled, or skilled manual/non-manual) or higher (managerial/technical 
18:446:35340:27:28:72:484:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or professional) social class occupation when you were 14. Specifically, we estimate:

19:449:35508:0:28:72:520:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Equation (2) is identical to equation (1) except now we include an interaction between infant 
19:450:35602:28:28:72:537:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality (퐼푀푖푟푐) and higher (퐻퐼퐺퐻푖푟푐) and lower (퐿푂푊푖푟푐) early-life socioeconomic status. We 
19:451:35696:28:28:72:518:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:include both interactions between infant mortality and socioeconomic status and exclude the 
19:452:35788:28:27:72:210:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infant mortality main effect. 
19:453:35817:27:28:72:519:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:If differences by early-life socioeconomic status exist, they would be reflected in differences 
19:454:35913:28:28:72:244:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between 훽1 and 훽2 in equation (2).  
19:455:35946:28:28:72:251:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Age when Effects Become Manifest 
19:456:35978:28:27:108:525:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To investigate the timing (age of occurrence) of observed effects, we estimate a model 
19:457:36065:27:28:72:472:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that allows the effect of infant mortality to differ by age. Specifically, we estimate: 
19:458:36151:28:29:72:516:459:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f6:B:(3) 푌푖푟푐푚푎=훼+훽1(퐼푀푖푟푐∗퐴퐺퐸1)+훽2(퐼푀푖푟푐∗퐴퐺퐸2)+훽3(퐼푀푖푟푐∗퐴퐺퐸3)+훾푋푖푎+

19:460:36231:27:28:72:543:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Equation (3) is also identical to equation (1) except now we allow the effect of infant mortality to 
19:461:36329:28:27:72:526:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differ by age classified by terciles [the 1st (lowest) tercile ranges from 40 to 53; the 2nd tercile 
19:462:36428:27:28:72:502:348:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ranges from 54 to 59; the 3rd (highest) tercile ranges from 60 to 73]. We include all three 
19:463:36520:28:28:72:510:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interactions between infant mortality and age groups and exclude the infant mortality main 
19:464:36610:28:27:72:105:292:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect. 
19:465:36617:27:28:72:194:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Considering Birth Rates 
19:466:36640:28:27:108:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:One issue that merits consideration is the potential response of births to infant mortality.13 
19:467:36734:27:28:72:527:210:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:For example, parents may try to replace children lost to illness (Ben-Porath 1976). Wartime in 
19:468:36829:28:28:72:524:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the UK brought considerable changes in birth rates. Total births in London fell along with the 
19:469:36924:28:27:72:538:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population, but rebounded beginning in 1942 (available in Appendix Figure 3). A similar pattern 
19:470:37020:27:41:72:533:127:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is evident from the regions outside London (Appendix Figure 4). Also, note that London makes 
19:471:37112:41:8:72:219:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
19:472:37159:8:0:72:501:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:13 There may be other (parental) responses, but we are unable to measure them because of data limitations. 
20:473:37266:0:28:72:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:up a relatively small fraction (15%) of total births. We also document birth rates for the entire 
20:474:37364:28:28:72:529:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:country (Appendix Figure 5), which indicates that the birth rate started increasing beginning in 
20:475:37461:28:27:72:535:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1942, eventually peaking in the immediate post-war years. Birth rates from 1935-41 were stable 
20:476:37556:27:28:72:522:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:at around 15 per 1,000 total population, but in 1942 birth rates increased to 17 per 1,000 total 
20:477:37653:28:27:72:501:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population. From 1942 until well after the end of the war, birth rates stay at or above this 
20:478:37746:27:28:72:338:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:elevated level with some noticeable decline after 1947. 
20:479:37801:28:28:108:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The increase in birth rates in 1942 is suggestive of a parental response to the negative 
20:480:37890:28:27:72:538:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health shock that may vary at the region-by-time level and would not be accounted for by any of 
20:481:37986:27:28:72:539:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the fixed effects in the regression specification.14 In short, the fertility response may have altered 
20:482:38088:28:27:72:521:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:later life outcomes because of differences in family size (spacing) by birth cohort and region. 
20:483:38184:27:28:72:491:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore, we estimate some models with birth rates to assess whether estimates of the 
20:484:38271:28:28:72:533:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:association between infant mortality and later life outcomes is sensitive to the inclusion of birth 
20:485:38371:28:29:72:100:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rates.

20:487:38377:31:27:72:112:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Results 
20:488:38384:27:28:108:537:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:Table 3 presents estimates of the effect of infant mortality in the respondent’s region and 
20:489:38476:28:27:72:528:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:year of birth on adult outcomes.15 In all regressions, infant mortality is standardized to have an 
20:490:38574:27:28:72:513:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overall mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and standard errors are clustered by region of 
20:491:38667:28:27:72:537:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth-by-year of birth cells. The first column of Table 3 shows the baseline specification without 
20:492:38765:27:28:72:520:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:additional person-level covariates or controls for birth rates. The second column adds person-
20:493:38859:28:32:72:542:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level controls including age, sex, and current region of residence. The third column adds the birth 
20:494:38959:32:8:72:219:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
20:495:39006:8:15:72:521:112:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:14 As noted earlier, there may be other parental responses, but we cannot measure them. We are able to measure 
20:496:39116:15:8:72:102:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:births,  
20:497:39124:8:15:72:528:89:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:15 We also estimated a non-linear specification where infant mortality entered as a quadratic form (available upon 
20:498:39238:15:0:72:393:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:request), but the results do not differ qualitatively from the linear specification.  
21:499:39325:0:28:72:519:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:rate in the year and region the respondent was born. The fourth column adds region-specific, 
21:500:39416:28:28:72:187:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linear birth-year trends. 
21:501:39440:28:27:72:507:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Estimates for each outcome are similar across the four columns. Estimates that are 
21:502:39523:27:28:72:523:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically significant suggest a scarring effect and an adverse effect of poor infant health on 
21:503:39622:28:27:72:500:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:adult health and socioeconomic status. For instance, the effect of infant mortality on self-
21:504:39714:27:28:72:542:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported disability in columns 1 through 4 suggest that a one standard deviation increase in infant 
21:505:39814:28:28:72:484:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality (roughly the size of the increase between 1939 and 1941) is associated with 
21:506:39900:28:27:72:529:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:approximately a 3.9 percentage point increase in disability, which is a 39% increase relative to 
21:507:39996:27:28:72:496:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the mean. The estimate remains stable across all specifications. A summary of the other 
21:508:40084:28:28:72:500:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant effects of a one standard deviation increase in infant mortality is as follows:16 
21:509:40176:28:29:90:530:432:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:A: approximately a 9.3 percentage point (17%) decrease in the probability of having a job; 
21:510:40263:29:27:90:475:403:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:A: and an approximately a £2180 reduction (21%) in annual real labor income. 
21:511:40336:27:28:72:534:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Notably, estimates in column 4, which come from regression models with region-specific, birth-
21:512:40429:28:28:72:511:348:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:year linear trends are largely similar to estimates in other columns. The specification of the 
21:513:40523:28:27:72:524:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model in column 4 controls for potentially unmeasured confounding from factors that vary by 
21:514:40613:27:28:72:512:293:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:region and birth year. Therefore, the similarity of estimates across columns suggest that the 
21:515:40707:28:27:72:510:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variation in infant mortality arises largely exogenously due to the war conditions described 
21:516:40800:27:28:72:111:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earlier.  
21:517:40808:28:28:72:488:210:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f4:B: In Table 4, we explore whether the effects of infant mortality differ by father’s 
21:518:40888:28:27:72:514:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:occupational (socioeconomic) status. In particular, we estimate equation (2) which includes 
21:519:40980:27:46:72:526:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interactions between infant mortality and indicators for whether your father worked in a lower 
21:520:41075:46:8:72:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
21:521:41122:8:16:72:525:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:16 If we apply the Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, only the estimates associated with 
21:522:41235:16:11:72:540:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:having a job remains significant. Note, however, that the Holm-Bonferroni correction is overly conservative because 
21:523:41351:11:0:72:333:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:it assumes that estimates are independent, which is not the case.  
22:524:41419:0:28:72:513:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(unskilled, partly-skilled, or skilled manual/non-manual) or higher (managerial/technical or 
22:525:41512:28:28:72:486:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:professional) social class occupation when you were 14. In the regression, we include 
22:526:41598:28:27:72:523:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interactions between mortality and both SES categories and exclude the main infant mortality 
22:527:41691:27:28:72:531:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect. Estimates in Table 4 indicate that for most outcomes the effect of infant mortality shock 
22:528:41788:28:27:72:523:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on adult outcomes is statistically the same for those from lower and higher SES families. The 
22:529:41882:27:28:72:528:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:one exception pertains to the estimates of whether a person has a job. In this case, the estimate 
22:530:41977:28:28:72:505:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for the high socioeconomic group is noticeably smaller and statistically different from the 
22:531:42069:28:27:72:526:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimate for the low socioeconomic group. P-values reported in column (3) test the equality of 
22:532:42164:27:28:72:535:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the estimates from columns (1) and (2). In all but two cases, we fail to reject the null hypothesis 
22:533:42264:28:27:72:511:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that the estimates are statistically the same. For one of these outcomes, owns home, neither 
22:534:42356:27:28:72:540:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimate is statistically different from zero. These results suggest that, in general, either exposure 
22:535:42457:28:28:72:534:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to the shock was no worse for those in lower and higher SES households or that family SES did 
22:536:42551:28:27:72:484:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not moderate the relationship, with the exception related to whether a person works.   
22:537:42635:27:28:108:531:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In Table 5, we explore whether the infant mortality effects differ by age of onset. To do 
22:538:42725:28:27:72:519:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:so, we estimate equation (3), allowing the effect of infant mortality to differ by age, which is 
22:539:42820:27:28:72:530:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measured as indicators denoting age groups. 40 to 53; 54 to 59; and 60 to 73. In the regression, 
22:540:42917:28:28:72:538:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we include all interactions and exclude the main infant mortality effect.17 The results from Table 
22:541:43015:28:27:72:493:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:5 are consistent with those in Table 3, but show that the adverse effects of mortality are 
22:542:43106:27:28:72:524:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:concentrated later in life. For instance, the effect of mortality on the probability of reporting a 
22:543:43206:28:27:72:538:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disability are smaller for those in the first two age groups (i.e. those 59 and under) than for those 
22:544:43306:27:48:72:541:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the oldest group and not statistically significant. For those in the oldest age group, the estimate 
22:545:43408:48:8:72:219:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
22:546:43455:8:16:72:523:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:17 We also estimated a specification interacting infant mortality and a quadratic in age, and calculated the partial 
22:547:43571:16:11:72:520:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:effects of mortality on the outcomes at the midpoints of the age terciles. The partial effects at these ages line up 
22:548:43688:11:0:72:331:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:closely with the effects by age terciles (available upon request).  
23:549:43757:0:28:72:533:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:suggests a one standard deviation in mortality is associated with a 4.6 percentage point increase 
23:550:43853:28:28:72:536:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the probability of reporting a disability, which is a roughly 46% increase relative to the mean. 
23:551:43952:28:27:72:518:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A similar pattern emerges for the probability of having and job and real annual labor income 
23:552:44045:27:28:72:302:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with associations becoming larger at later ages. 
23:553:44093:28:27:72:201:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Randomization Inference 
23:554:44116:27:28:108:506:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In order to assess the validity of the analytical approach to statistical inference, we 
23:555:44204:28:28:72:527:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conducted two randomization inference analyses in which we expect to find null effects. First, 
23:556:44298:28:27:72:504:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we reassign the value of infant mortality using the value of infant mortality in a randomly 
23:557:44390:27:28:72:529:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:selected birth region. For example, the randomization assigned all those born in East Midlands 
23:558:44485:28:27:72:513:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(in any year) the infant mortality rate in the South East (in the same birth year). We did this 
23:559:44581:27:28:72:525:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:randomization 1000 times and re-estimated the model using the specification in column (3) of 
23:560:44674:28:28:72:531:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table 3.18 The second randomization analysis reassigned the value of infant mortality using the 
23:561:44768:28:27:72:506:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:value of infant mortality in a randomly selected birth year. For example, we reassigned all 
23:562:44859:27:28:72:475:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:persons born in 1948 the infant mortality in their region in 1942. Again, we did this 
23:563:44945:28:27:72:339:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:randomization 1000 times and re-estimated the model.  
23:564:44998:27:28:108:533:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Table 6 displays the results of these two randomization analyses. Column (1) of Table 6 
23:565:45086:28:28:72:540:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shows the estimates from column 3 of Table 3. Columns (2) and (3) report p-values from the two 
23:566:45181:28:27:72:536:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:randomization analyses. The p-values are calculated as the proportion of estimates (out of 1000) 
23:567:45278:27:28:72:534:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that are larger in absolute value than the estimate in column (1). So, the p-value of 0.566 in row 
23:568:45375:28:27:72:472:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1) and column (2) of Table 5 indicates that 566 out of the 1000 estimates from the 
23:569:45457:27:28:72:537:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:randomization exercise that reassigned regions were larger than the actual estimate. This finding 
23:570:45555:28:43:72:526:129:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D:suggests that the actual estimate is not “unusual” and is unlikely to be a true effect. Consistent 
23:571:45654:43:8:72:219:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                
23:572:45701:8:0:72:249:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:18 There are 362,880 possible permutations. 
24:573:45745:0:28:72:509:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with this result is the fact that the estimate in row (1) and column (1) of the effect of infant 
24:574:45842:28:28:72:535:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality on excellent health is small (<3%) and not statistically significant. For every outcome, 
24:575:45940:28:27:72:516:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the results of the two randomization-inference analyses are consistent with the actual results 
24:576:46035:27:28:72:526:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reported in column (1) of Table 6. When the actual estimate is relatively large and statistically 
24:577:46133:28:27:72:525:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant, the corresponding p-value from the randomization inference tests are small. These 
24:578:46226:27:28:72:494:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:results provide strong evidence that the inference approach used in Table 3 are reliable.

24:580:46315:28:27:72:179:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sensitivity Analyses  
24:581:46336:27:28:108:513:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In Table 7, we report a variety of sensitivity analyses that address possible concerns 
24:582:46422:28:28:72:401:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related to sample selection and the measurement of infant mortality. 
24:583:46490:28:27:72:262:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Altering the Birth Cohorts Examined  
24:584:46525:27:28:108:510:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As noted earlier, our sample includes individuals born between 1935 and 1950. We 
24:585:46606:28:27:72:502:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hypothesize that including cohorts born before the shock may attenuate estimates if older 
24:586:46695:27:28:72:528:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children (e.g. those born in 1935 who would be 6 or 7 in 1940/41) were themselves harmed by 
24:587:46787:28:27:72:541:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the 1940-41 health environment. We assess this hypothesis by re-estimating the regression model 
24:588:46882:27:28:72:517:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with a sample that excludes these earlier cohorts. We also explore whether our estimates are 
24:589:46975:28:28:72:538:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sensitive to using different ending birth cohorts instead of 1950, specifically, 1945 and 1955.For 
24:590:47073:28:27:72:389:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:comparison, column 1 of Table 7 replicates column 3 of Table 3.  
24:591:47137:27:28:108:521:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In column 2 of Table 7, we present estimates from a model that includes cohorts born 
24:592:47221:28:27:72:536:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between 1940 and 1950. Comparing estimates in columns (1) and (2) indicates that there is little 
24:593:47318:27:28:72:533:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difference, particularly for estimates that are statistically significant. The similarity of estimates 
24:594:47420:28:28:72:530:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and lack of attenuation when earlier birth cohorts are included suggests that the effect of health 
24:595:47517:28:0:72:463:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shocks in infancy are more important than health shocks at later childhood ages.  
25:596:47600:0:28:108:530:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Estimates in columns 3 and 4, which alter the ending year of the birth cohorts included, 
25:597:47687:28:28:72:535:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are also consistent with those in Table 3. These estimates show that the adverse effects of infant 
25:598:47786:28:27:72:509:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortality are not sensitive to the sample period. Overall, changing the beginning or ending 
25:599:47877:27:28:72:397:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:period of birth cohorts has relatively little effect on the estimates.19 
25:600:47949:28:27:72:294:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Using Only One Observation per Individual  
25:601:47990:27:28:108:521:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As noted earlier, the average individual is observed in approximately 11 waves of the 
25:602:48074:28:28:72:538:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:survey, with a standard deviation of 6. To address any concern that estimates and standard errors 
25:603:48171:28:27:72:535:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:may be biased by using multiple observations per person, we re-estimate models using a sample 
25:604:48265:27:28:72:525:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consisting of a randomly selected observation for each person. So, the sample for this analysis 
25:605:48361:28:27:72:542:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consists of the 3,312 unique individuals with characteristics that have the same distribution as the 
25:606:48461:27:28:72:461:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:full sample. The results from this analysis are presented in column 5 of Table 7.  
25:607:48541:28:28:108:539:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Qualitatively, estimates in column 5 are similar to other estimates and indicate that infant 
25:608:48634:28:27:72:522:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health shocks are associated with adverse adult health. For example, a one standard deviation 
25:609:48728:27:28:72:527:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase in infant mortality is associated with approximately a 6.8 percentage point increase in 
25:610:48824:28:27:72:503:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disability. For this sample, however, we observe evidence of scarring for more outcomes. 
25:611:48913:27:28:72:496:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Estimates suggest that infant mortality is negatively associated with self-reported health 
25:612:49004:28:28:72:532:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(decrease in good health and increase in poor health) and positively associated with presence of 
25:613:49101:28:27:72:511:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health problems. However, while magnitudes of estimates are suggestive, estimates are not 
25:614:49190:27:28:72:532:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant. Finally, we note that standard errors using the randomly selected sample are similar 
25:615:49288:28:98:72:305:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to estimates using all person-year observations.

25:617:49384:8:0:72:512:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:D:19 The one exception to this conclusion may be estimates for whether a person has a chest/breathing problem. 
26:618:49493:0:27:72:163:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Omitting London  
26:619:49508:27:28:108:523:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Because residents of London experienced the greatest amount of relocation during the 
26:620:49593:28:27:72:540:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:war, there is a concern about potential measurement error in infant mortality. To address this, we 
26:621:49691:27:28:72:514:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:re-estimating our primary specification omitting people who reported being born in London 
26:622:49781:28:27:72:525:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Column 6 of Table 7). A comparison between estimates in Column 6 and Column 1 (original 
26:623:49870:27:28:72:536:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates) indicates that they are very similar suggesting that any measurement error introduced 
26:624:49967:28:28:72:267:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by dislocation does not affect estimates.

26:626:50008:27:28:72:132:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Conclusion 
26:627:50018:28:27:108:537:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The marked increase in infant mortality in England and Wales during WWII represents a 
26:628:50104:27:28:72:533:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:severe infant health shock. As other research has suggested, such adverse health shocks early in 
26:629:50201:28:28:72:530:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:life may have long lasting effects. In this paper, we add to that literature by examining how the 
26:630:50298:28:27:72:539:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spike in infant mortality in Great Britain at the start of WWII affected adult outcomes. Historical 
26:631:50398:27:28:72:538:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence suggests that the sharp rise in infant mortality in England in 1940 and 1941 was largely 
26:632:50495:28:27:72:513:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:driven by a combination of a wartime food rationing program, unusually harsh winters, and 
26:633:50585:27:28:72:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dislocation of families and health services due to the war. Moreover, the extent of the adverse 
26:634:50681:28:28:72:530:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health shocks varied considerably across regions within England. It is this plausibly exogenous 
26:635:50777:28:27:72:516:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variation in infant health, arising largely due to greater rates of infectious disease, which we 
26:636:50874:27:28:72:450:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exploit to obtain estimates of the effect of early life health on adult outcomes.  
26:637:50956:28:27:72:511:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: We find that the wartime spike in infant mortality had a negative effect on later-life 
26:638:51043:27:28:72:518:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes. The results are consequential in magnitude. We find that a one standard deviation 
26:639:51135:28:28:72:516:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase in the region-specific infant mortality rate (roughly the size of the increase between 
26:640:51231:28:0:72:532:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1939 and 1941) was associated with a 39% increase in reporting a disability; a 17% decrease in 
27:641:51328:0:28:72:536:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the probability of having a job; and a 21% decrease in annual real earned income. The estimates 
27:642:51424:28:28:72:447:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:suggest plausibly that a disability causes a person to drop out of employment. 
27:643:51502:28:27:108:515:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:One contribution of our study was focusing on recent birth cohorts, as relatively few 
27:644:51588:27:28:72:523:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studies have done so. Bozzolli et al. (2009) reported that, for birth cohorts from a comparable 
27:645:51679:28:27:72:533:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:period as those in our sample, higher rates of post-neonatal mortality from pneumonia, which is 
27:646:51774:27:28:72:516:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:similar to our context, was the most consistent predictor of lower adult height in the US and 
27:647:51867:28:28:72:531:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:European countries. The effect size for the US implied by these estimates is small—the change 
27:648:51960:28:27:72:532:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in post-neonatal mortality rate in the US from 1950 to 1980 is predicted to have increased adult 
27:649:52056:27:28:72:535:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:height by 0.2 centimeters. Case and Paxson (2009), reported that higher rates of infant mortality 
27:650:52152:28:27:72:539:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:among US cohorts born between 1910 and 1950 was associated with reduced cognitive function. 
27:651:52244:27:28:72:534:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Here too, the effect size was quite small; a 50% increase in infant mortality was associated with 
27:652:52342:28:28:72:522:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:one-tenth of a standard deviation decrease in cognitive test (word recall) score. Our estimates 
27:653:52438:28:27:72:509:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also show scarring effects of infant health shocks like these studies, but are effect sizes are 
27:654:52534:27:28:72:106:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:larger. 
27:655:52541:28:27:108:525:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Three other findings merit note. While descriptive evidence suggested that there was a 
27:656:52628:27:28:72:535:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fertility response to WWII and that average family size differed by birth cohort, this variation in 
27:657:52728:28:28:72:526:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fertility was not a confounding factor of the effect of infant mortality. Second, we found some 
27:658:52824:28:27:72:507:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence that higher socioeconomic status moderated the effect of the infant health shock. 
27:659:52915:27:28:72:536:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Finally, the evidence was clear that effects of the early life health shock grew with age and were 
27:660:53014:28:27:72:202:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more present after age 60.  
27:661:53041:27:28:108:512:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In summary, the findings of our study add to the literature documenting the adverse 
27:662:53125:28:28:72:536:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects on adult health and socioeconomic status of early life health shocks. Our study examined 
27:663:53221:28:0:72:514:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the effects of a specific health shock during a narrowly defined age (post-neonatal) on adult 
28:664:53317:0:28:72:534:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes for a contemporary population of adults in a developed country setting—England and 
28:665:53409:28:28:72:541:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Wales. Whether these findings are relevant to today is unknown, but poor infant health remains a 
28:666:53506:28:27:72:533:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problem among disadvantaged populations in developed countries. It is possible that the effects 
28:667:53602:27:28:72:536:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of such poor health on future adult outcomes may be diminished by current medical technology, 
28:668:53696:28:27:72:500:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and social and economic institutions, but if so, then this beneficial effect underscores the 
28:669:53789:27:28:72:491:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:importance of these mediating forces. If not, then our results highlight the potential for 
28:670:53880:28:28:72:431:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant benefits from interventions targeted at improving infant health.
