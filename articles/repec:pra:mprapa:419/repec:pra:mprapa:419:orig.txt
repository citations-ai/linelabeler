3:46:674:14:28:72:155:694:144:Times:144:Times:1.  Introduction 
3:47:691:28:28:72:496:666:144:Times:144:Times: Central bank policy influences the supply of monetary services.  The transmission 
3:48:773:28:28:72:533:638:144:Times:144:Times:mechanism is not the same in all countries, but commonly the procedure operates through open 
3:49:866:28:28:72:528:610:144:Times:144:Times:market operations, by which the central bank buys or sells domestic Treasury securities.  Such 
3:50:961:28:28:72:527:582:144:Times:144:Times:purchases and sales alter the central bank’s balance sheet and thereby “high powered money,” 
3:51:1054:28:28:72:501:554:144:Times:144:Times:also called the monetary base, defined to be the sum of currency and bank reserves.  The 
3:52:1143:28:28:72:538:526:144:Times:144:Times:resulting changes in interest rates and in bank balance sheets alter “inside money,” defined to be 
3:53:1242:28:28:72:526:498:144:Times:144:Times:monetary services produced by banks and other financial intermediaries.  How to measure the 
3:54:1334:28:28:72:531:470:144:Times:144:Times:resulting change in the supplied monetary-service flow in the economy is a complicated matter 
3:55:1428:28:27:72:524:442:144:Times:144:Times:that has been the subject of much debate.  The entry on “Divisia monetary aggregates” in this 
3:56:1522:27:28:72:542:415:144:Times:144:Times:encyclopedia deals with demand-side financial-services aggregation, while this Supply of Money 
3:57:1617:28:28:72:230:387:144:Times:144:Times:entry deals with the supply side. 
3:58:1651:28:28:72:528:359:144:Times:144:Times: The conventional measurement procedure is to add up the nominal balances of monetary 
3:59:1736:28:28:72:543:331:144:Times:144:Times:assets.  The resulting sum is called the “money supply.”  Subtracting the monetary base from that 
3:60:1834:28:28:72:518:303:144:Times:144:Times:sum produces what is commonly treated as inside money.  Much of the modern literature on 
3:61:1923:28:28:72:512:275:144:Times:144:Times:business cycles revolves around empirical work on the relative effects of inside money and 
3:62:2014:28:28:72:500:247:144:Times:144:Times:outside money.  But the usual measurement of inside money is unrelated to the theory of 
3:63:2102:28:28:72:504:219:144:Times:144:Times:production and the ways in which that theory determines the output services produced by 
3:64:2190:28:28:72:198:191:144:Times:144:Times:financial intermediaries.   
3:65:2218:28:28:72:75:163:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:66:2218:28:28:72:201:135:144:Times:144:Times:2.  High Powered Money 
3:67:2241:28:28:72:505:107:144:Times:144:Times: During the depression of the 1930s, the monetary base continued to rise in a normal 
3:68:2325:28:0:72:527:79:144:Times:144:Times:manner as the supply of money in the economy collapsed.  Why did this happen?  Currency is 
4:69:2417:0:28:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:dollar-for-dollar pure money.  But reserves back demand deposits with a multiplier, k.  For every 
4:70:2515:28:28:72:538:680:144:Times:144:Times:dollar removed from demand deposits as the banking system crashed, currency increased by one 
4:71:2608:28:28:72:514:652:144:Times:144:Times:dollar, while reserves declined by 1/k dollars, so that the monetary base changed by 1 - 1/k, 
4:72:2702:28:28:72:507:624:144:Times:144:Times:which is positive.  Hence runs on banks increased the monetary base at the same time that 
4:73:2792:28:28:72:540:596:144:Times:144:Times:demand deposits were declining and banks were failing.  As an instrument or indicator of policy, 
4:74:2889:28:28:72:522:568:144:Times:144:Times:the monetary base is defective, since it adds together currency and reserves, which have very 
4:75:2983:28:27:72:234:540:144:Times:144:Times:different effects on the economy. 
4:76:3017:27:29:72:75:513:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:77:3017:29:28:72:160:484:144:Times:144:Times:3.  Inside Money 
4:78:3034:28:27:72:539:456:144:Times:144:Times: According to the theory of production, there are two ways to measure the output of a firm.  
4:79:3126:27:28:72:533:429:144:Times:144:Times:One way is to measure the gross value of the output “aggregator function, g.”  The other way is 
4:80:3222:28:28:72:507:401:144:Times:144:Times:to measure the net “value added” by the firm’s production.  By the most conventional and 
4:81:3311:28:28:72:539:373:144:Times:144:Times:simplest accounting convention, called “double deflation,” value added subtracts from aggregate 
4:82:3407:28:28:72:511:345:144:Times:144:Times:output the aggregate over intermediate factor inputs.  Value added then depends only upon 
4:83:3497:28:28:72:528:317:144:Times:144:Times:primary inputs, such as capital, land, and labor.  In the obsolete labor theory of value, only the 
4:84:3596:28:28:72:522:289:144:Times:144:Times:one labor factor was needed, since inputs were assumed to be employed in fixed proportions. 
4:85:3688:28:29:72:488:261:144:Times:144:Times: Consider the case of a bank that produces a vector of n monetary-asset balances, 
4:86:3769:29:32:192:516:232:144:Times:144:Times:, during period t and pays on those assets the nominal interest rates 
4:87:3839:32:31:171:529:200:144:Times:144:Times:, by employing the vectors of primary inputs, x1t, and intermediate inputs, 
4:88:3915:31:29:72:528:169:144:Times:144:Times:x2t.  If the bank’s technology is described by the production function, f, with outputs separable 
4:89:4013:29:28:72:534:140:144:Times:144:Times:from inputs, we can write g(mt) = f(x1t,x2t), where the value of the output aggregator function is 
4:90:4112:28:28:71:515:112:144:Times:144:Times:Mt = g(mt).  For the most general procedure to measure value added in banking, see Barnett 
4:91:4203:28:0:72:174:84:144:Times:144:Times:(2000, pp. 92 - 93).

4:93:4255:32:0:104:78:197:49:Times:144:Times:12  = (   ,     , ... ,     )ttt ntrrr′r
5:94:4296:0:28:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times: The special case of double deflation accounting requires two further assumptions.  The first 
5:95:4389:28:28:72:530:680:144:Times:144:Times:is the existence of aggregator functions, f1 and f2, over primary and intermediate inputs, so that 
5:96:4488:28:28:72:486:652:144:Times:144:Times:Mt = g(mt) = f(f1(x1t), f2(x2t)).  The second is strong separability between primary and 
5:97:4577:28:28:72:522:624:144:Times:144:Times:intermediary inputs, so that Mt = g(mt) = f1(x1t) + f2(x2t).  Value added then becomes f1(x1t) = 
5:98:4674:28:28:72:142:596:144:Times:144:Times:g(mt) - f2(x2t). 
5:99:4691:28:28:72:505:568:144:Times:144:Times: Under those assumptions, production theory tells us that the supply of inside money 
5:100:4775:28:29:72:525:540:144:Times:144:Times:produced by a bank can be measured by, Mt = g(mt), while value added in banking is f1(x1t) = 
5:101:4868:29:34:71:513:511:144:Times:144:Times:g(mt) - f2(x2t).  Neither theoretical concept has any known relationship with the simple sum 
5:102:4961:34:37:72:532:477:144:Times:144:Times:monetary aggregate, , provided by most central banks, or with inside money, as measured 
5:103:5049:37:28:72:535:440:144:Times:144:Times:by the simple sum monetary aggregate minus the monetary base.  In contrast, it has been shown 
5:104:5143:28:28:72:538:412:144:Times:144:Times:in Barnett (2000) that total inside money services, Mt = g(mt), can be measured from the Divisia 
5:105:5240:28:28:72:528:384:144:Times:144:Times:index over mt, and that value added in banking, g(mt) - f2(x2t), can be measured by subtracting 
5:106:5336:28:0:72:241:356:144:Times:144:Times:from Mt the Divisia index over x2t.

5:117:5496:28:28:72:532:244:144:Times:144:Times:As explained there, user-cost prices must be used within the formula, since monetary assets are

6:149:6394:28:28:72:537:465:144:Times:144:Times:Since the transmission mechanism of money is sometimes viewed as operating through a wealth

6:151:6581:28:28:72:518:409:144:Times:144:Times:economic capital stock of money.  Because of the dependency of that capital stock on future 
6:152:6673:28:28:72:536:381:144:Times:144:Times:expectations, measurement of that capital stock is one of the most challenging areas of this field 
6:153:6772:28:28:72:494:353:144:Times:144:Times:of research.  Since money is now a joint product producing both monetary services and 
6:154:6858:28:28:72:517:325:144:Times:144:Times:investment yield, wealth effects must untangle the discounted present value of the monetary 
6:155:6950:28:28:72:512:297:144:Times:144:Times:services flow from the discounted present value of the investment yield.  See, e.g., Barnett, 
6:156:7044:28:28:72:202:269:144:Times:144:Times:Keating, and Chae (2006).

6:159:7085:28:28:72:495:185:144:Times:144:Times: There is reason to be concerned about conclusions regarding policy reached using 
6:160:7166:28:28:72:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:conventional monetary aggregates and conventional measures of inside versus outside money.  
6:161:7258:28:28:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:The data provided by many central banks is unrelated to the relevant economic theory, unless all 
6:162:7355:28:0:72:510:101:144:Times:144:Times:financial assets are perfect substitutes.  With different interest rates being paid on different 
7:163:7453:0:28:72:497:708:144:Times:144:Times:monetary assets, that implied assumption has been unreasonable for over a half century. 
7:164:7541:28:28:72:514:680:144:Times:144:Times: Although little research has been done using the relevant theory to measure aggregate 
7:165:7627:28:28:72:520:652:144:Times:144:Times:money on the supply side, a few such empirical studies have been published and reprinted in
