2:17:490:32:21:141:484:537:9:Courier:9:Courier:This paper studies the implications for general equilibrium asset
2:18:555:21:21:115:474:516:9:Courier:9:Courier:pricing of a recently introduced class of Kreps-Porteus non-expected
2:19:623:21:21:115:490:495:9:Courier:9:Courier:utility preferences, which is characterized by a constant intertemporal
2:20:694:21:21:116:496:474:9:Courier:9:Courier:elasticity of substitution and a constant, but unrelated, coefficient of
2:21:766:21:21:116:235:453:9:Courier:9:Courier:relative risk aversion.
2:22:789:21:21:143:482:432:9:Courier:9:Courier:It is shown that the solution to the "equity premium puzzle" doc-
2:23:854:21:22:116:470:411:9:Courier:9:Courier:umented by Mehra and Prescott [19851 cannot be found, for plausibly
2:24:921:22:21:117:513:389:9:Courier:9:Courier:calibrated parameter values, by simply separating risk aversion from inter-
2:25:996:21:20:118:486:368:9:Courier:9:Courier:temporal substitution. Rather, relaxing the parametric restriction on
2:26:1065:20:20:118:494:348:9:Courier:9:Courier:tastes implicit in the time-addictive expected utility specification and
2:27:1137:20:22:118:494:328:9:Courier:9:Courier:adopting Kreps-Porteus preferences in the direction of "more realism" is
2:28:1209:22:24:118:494:306:9:Courier:9:Courier:likely to add a "riskfree rate puzzle" to Mehra's and Prescott's "equity
2:29:1281:24:29:118:202:282:9:Courier:9:Courier:premium puzzle."

3:34:1370:0:16:131:511:691:16:Times:16:Times:The purp of this paler is to study the implicatioiis for general
3:35:1434:16:16:114:509:675:15:Times:15:Times:equilibrium asset )rici1g of the 1)aralflctric classof Kreps-Porteus
3:36:1502:16:16:115:512:659:15:Times:15:Times:non-expccted utility preferences introduced recently by Epstein- Zin
3:37:1570:16:16:116:511:643:14:Times:14:Times:[1987a1 and myself (Weil [19871).' These preferences generalize, iii a
3:38:1640:16:15:115:510:627:15:Times:15:Times:non-expected utility framework, the cominoiily used time-additive,
3:39:1706:15:14:116:512:612:15:Times:15:Times:isoelastic expected utility specification to allow for an independent
3:40:1775:14:17:116:511:598:16:Times:16:Times:parametrization of attitudes toward risk and attitudes toward in-
3:41:1840:17:17:116:512:581:15:Times:15:Times:tertemporal substitution. They are characterized by a constant in-
3:42:1906:17:15:117:514:564:15:Times:15:Times:tertemporal elasticity of substitution and a constant, but unrelated,
3:43:1975:15:17:117:513:549:15:Times:15:Times:coefficient of relative risk aversion, and thus relax the well-known
3:44:2043:17:14:117:512:532:15:Times:15:Times:constraint intrinsic to time-additive, isoelastic expected utility that
3:45:2114:14:17:117:513:518:15:Times:15:Times:the intertemporal elasticity of substitution be the inverse of the con-
3:46:2185:17:16:117:355:501:15:Times:15:Times:stant coefficient of relative risk aversion.
3:47:2229:16:15:135:513:485:15:Times:15:Times:Adopting this new class of preferences has clear benefits. Firstly,
3:48:2296:15:17:118:514:470:15:Times:15:Times:these preferences do not impose a behavioral restriction on tastes
3:49:2362:17:14:118:513:453:14:Times:14:Times:which is devoid of any theoretical rationale, and which has many un-
3:50:2430:14:18:118:515:439:14:Times:14:Times:pleasant side-effects.2 Secondly, the data reject the time-additive ex-
3:51:2501:18:16:118:513:421:15:Times:15:Times:pected utility restriction, as established by Epstein and Zin [1987b}.
3:52:2571:16:15:119:516:405:14:Times:14:Times:Thirdly, from an analytical point of view, this class of Kreps-Porteus
3:53:2641:15:17:119:516:390:15:Times:15:Times:preferences is very simple to work with and a very natural general-
3:54:2708:17:15:119:391:373:15:Times:15:Times:ization of isoelastic preferences to uncertainty.
3:55:2757:15:16:137:515:358:15:Times:15:Times:Yet, despite these advantages, it is legitimate and necessary to
3:56:2821:16:16:119:515:342:15:Times:15:Times:wonder whether these new preferences contribute, even partially, to
3:57:2888:16:16:120:515:326:16:Times:16:Times:the resolution of any the many outstanding asset pricing or con-
3:58:2952:16:16:120:516:310:16:Times:16:Times:sumption theory puzzles. Do those puzzles disappear once pref-
3:59:3014:16:15:120:514:294:15:Times:15:Times:erences are "correctly" specified and the expected,time-additive
3:60:3078:15:16:120:514:279:15:Times:15:Times:utility restriction lifted? Can we conclude that the role wehad at-
3:61:3145:16:17:121:517:263:15:Times:15:Times:tributed, in the empirical difficulties of frictionless asset pricing or
3:62:3217:17:15:120:516:246:15:Times:15:Times:permanent income theories, to incomplete markets or liquidity con-
3:63:3283:15:16:121:517:231:15:Times:15:Times:straints was misplaced, and that the only problem was in reality one
3:64:3351:16:21:121:515:215:15:Times:15:Times:of mis-specification of preferences? It would be surprising that the
3:65:3419:21:13:134:516:194:11:Times:11:Times:1See Kreps and Porteus [1978, 1979a, 1979b] for the axiomatic foundations of these
3:66:3501:13:8:122:171:181:10:Times:10:Times:preferences.
3:67:3513:8:11:134:519:173:11:Times:11:Times:2Among them figure prominently: i) the impossibility of replicating the behavior of agents
3:68:3603:11:10:122:520:162:11:Times:11:Times:who are both moderately risk averse and yet very averse to intertemporal substitution (as
3:69:3692:10:12:122:519:152:11:Times:11:Times:most available empirical evidence suggests is the case), and ii) the difficulty, pointed out by
3:70:3787:12:13:122:517:140:11:Times:11:Times:Hall [1985], of determining whether regressions of log growth rates of consumption on mean
3:71:3877:13:10:122:518:127:10:Helvetica:11:Times:logreal interest rates provide an estimate of risk aversion or intertemporal substitution (see
3:72:3971:10:44:122:256:117:11:Times:11:Times:my [1987] paper on this point).

4:75:4068:14:16:149:423:689:15:Times:15:Times:and indeed it is not, as this paper will suggest.
4:76:4117:16:16:167:544:673:15:Times:15:Times:The test to which this study submits this new parailietric class
4:77:4181:16:16:149:544:657:15:Times:15:Times:of non-expected utility Preferences is the one devised by Melira and
4:78:4249:16:18:150:543:641:14:Times:14:Times:Prescott [1985]: can an artificial representative agent economy, Cal-
4:79:4318:18:14:149:544:623:15:Times:15:Times:ibrated with plausible parameter values and output process, repli-
4:80:4384:14:18:149:544:609:15:Times:15:Times:cate the average secular level of the riskfree rate (0.75 %)andof
4:81:4449:18:15:150:544:591:15:Times:15:Times:the risk premium on equity (6.20 %)?Weknow, from Mehra's and
4:82:4509:15:17:150:546:576:15:Times:15:Times:Prescott's original work, that a representative agent economy with
4:83:4575:17:13:150:544:559:15:Times:15:Times:CES, time-additive, expected utility preferences and complete mar-
4:84:4641:13:16:150:544:546:15:Times:15:Times:kets cannot pass this test —becauseof the inability of the model
4:85:4705:16:15:150:544:530:15:Times:15:Times:to "fit" both the level of the riskfree rate and the discrepancy be-
4:86:4773:15:16:150:544:515:15:Times:15:Times:tween the safe and average risky rates. Does, however, an economy
4:87:4838:16:17:150:544:499:15:Times:15:Times:in which agents are endowed with the Kreps-Porteus generalization
4:88:4903:17:15:150:545:482:15:Times:15:Times:of CES preferences perform substantially better with respect to the
4:89:4970:15:12:150:545:467:15:Times:15:Times:Mehra-Prescott touchstone? While intuition suggests that it might
4:90:5035:12:20:150:546:455:14:Times:15:Times:—thesenew preferences afford an additional degree of freedom —
4:91:5097:20:16:151:378:435:13:Helvetica:15:Times:theanswer to this question is negative.
4:92:5136:16:16:168:545:419:14:Times:14:Times:As I will demonstrate below, the risk premium depends, for plau-
4:93:5200:16:15:151:546:403:14:Times:14:Times:sible calibrations of tastes and technology, almost exclusively on the
4:94:5270:15:16:151:545:388:14:Times:14:Times:coefficient of relative risk aversion. But this implies that relaxing the
4:95:5343:16:16:151:545:372:15:Times:15:Times:time-additive expected utility restriction on tastes does not substan-
4:96:5413:16:18:151:545:356:16:Times:16:Times:tially alter the fact, documented by Mehra and Prescott, that the
4:97:5478:18:14:151:544:338:15:Times:15:Times:model can replicate the risk premium only for astronomically high
4:98:5543:14:16:151:544:324:15:Times:15:Times:levels of risk aversion —thusleaving the equity premium puzzle
4:99:5605:16:16:151:545:308:15:Times:15:Times:intact. What emerges from the relaxation of this restriction and the
4:100:5673:16:17:151:545:292:15:Times:15:Times:appropriate calibration of tastes, is, as we shall see, an additional
4:101:5742:17:15:151:546:275:15:Times:15:Times:puzzle, centered around the riskfree rate: why is it, if consumers
4:102:5808:15:16:152:546:260:15:Times:15:Times:are as averse to intertemporal substitution as some recent estimates
4:103:5876:16:16:151:356:244:15:Times:15:Times:suggest, that the riskfree is so low?
4:104:5913:16:16:168:544:228:15:Times:15:Times:The analysis proceeds as follows. Section 1 presents the model,
4:105:5976:16:16:151:547:212:15:Times:15:Times:and solves for equilibrium asset prices and rates of return. Section
4:106:6044:16:17:152:547:196:15:Times:15:Times:2 establishes the main results of the paper: separating risk aversion
4:107:6113:17:17:152:546:179:14:Times:14:Times:from intertemporal substitution cannot, on its own, explain away the
4:108:6181:17:13:152:546:162:15:Times:15:Times:equity premium puzzle documented by Mehra and Prescott [1985],
4:109:6243:13:17:152:546:149:15:Times:15:Times:but instead highlights the existence of a "riskfree rate puzzle." The
4:110:6312:17:47:152:547:132:15:Times:15:Times:conclusion summarizes the paper, and outlines directions for further

5:114:6412:30:15:120:515:636:15:Times:15:Times:The economy is similar, expect for the agents' preferences, to the
5:115:6478:15:17:120:515:621:15:Times:15:Times:one studied by Lucas [1978] and Mehra and Prescott [1985]. I first
5:116:6544:17:15:120:516:604:14:Times:14:Times:describe technology and consumer behavior, and then compute equi-
5:117:6609:15:35:120:246:589:15:Times:15:Times:librium asset returns.

5:122:6842:16:16:121:515:482:16:Times:16:Times:stant population. Let yg the the number of fruits falling from a
5:123:6906:16:16:121:515:466:16:Times:16:Times:tree at time t, i.e., the "dividend" associated with holding a tree.
5:124:6974:16:16:121:517:450:16:Times:16:Times:It is assumed that the rate of growth of dividends, A Yt+i/Yt,
5:125:7036:16:18:121:517:434:15:Times:15:Times:is random and Markovian over a finite state space, with transition

6:163:9060:16:17:153:547:324:14:Times:14:Times:Porteus [1978, p.199], (4) also allows for preference for early (resp.,

6:173:9651:12:9:156:396:145:11:Times:11:Times:cally imposes the temporal consistency of optimal plans.

7:209:11880:11:12:126:523:173:11:Times:11:Times:no role [it can be eliminated by a monotone increasing transformation of (3)], in which case

8:217:12474:16:16:146:541:700:15:Times:15:Times:changes in the marginal utility of wealth do not solely reflect, in op-

8:219:12609:18:13:146:541:666:15:Times:15:Times:in expected future utility. Kreps-Porteus preferences thus introduce
8:220:12677:13:17:146:540:653:16:Times:16:Times:an effect very similar, at a formal level, to the one which would

8:244:13864:16:16:149:542:194:16:Times:14:Times:trees (Rk =Re).As Epstein and Zin [1987a] emphasize, an equation
8:245:13928:16:17:149:543:178:15:Times:15:Times:such as (11) suggests that that the covariance between the return on

10:309:16766:13:30:170:356:220:17:Times:17:Times:and the riskfree rate puzzle
10:310:16794:30:15:142:537:190:15:Times:15:Times:I now turn to the implications of this framework for the analysis

11:316:17122:14:17:120:515:682:15:Times:15:Times:cept for astronomical values of the CRRA (or, equivaleiitly in that

11:321:17420:12:16:138:516:602:16:Times:16:Times:Mehra and Prescott present this "puzzle" in the illuminating
11:322:17480:16:15:121:516:586:16:Times:16:Times:form of a dilemma. In the time-additive, expected utility frame-
11:323:17544:15:17:121:514:571:15:Times:15:Times:work which they consider (in which the CRRA is the inverse of the
11:324:17609:17:16:121:515:554:14:Times:14:Times:IES), a very high CRRA (of the order of 40 or 50) does make it pos-
11:325:17676:16:15:121:516:538:15:Times:15:Times:sible to replicate the large secular premium on equity; yet, because
11:326:17744:15:16:121:515:523:14:Times:14:Times:it is synonymous with a very low IES, it also leads to the counterfac-
11:327:17814:16:16:122:514:507:14:Times:14:Times:tual prediction of an extremely high riskfree rate! Conversely, a low
11:328:17883:16:16:122:517:491:15:Times:15:Times:CRRA leads to a counterfactually low equity premium, although it
11:329:17947:16:15:122:357:475:15:Times:15:Times:does imply a relatively low riskfree rate.
11:330:17989:15:17:139:515:460:16:Times:16:Times:It thus might seem that the major hurdle to be overcome iii
11:331:18048:17:15:123:517:443:15:Times:15:Times:solving the equity premium puzzle is a purely technical one. Inde-
11:332:18114:15:17:123:517:428:15:Times:15:Times:pendently parametrizing the IES and the CRRA should provide the
11:333:18177:17:15:123:517:411:15:Times:15:Times:additional degree of freedom which is required to replicate both the
11:334:18245:15:17:123:518:396:15:Times:15:Times:level of the riskfree rate and the discrepancy between the safe and
11:335:18312:17:15:123:518:379:15:Times:15:Times:the average risky rate. The implicit reasoning is, of course, that the
11:336:18382:15:16:123:518:364:15:Times:15:Times:riskfree rate is mainly "controlled" by the magnitude of the IES,
11:337:18447:16:16:123:426:348:15:Times:15:Times:while the risk premium is a reflection of the CRRA.
11:338:18498:16:15:141:516:332:15:Times:15:Times:I now demonstrate —boththeoretically for the case of i.i.d. div-

11:344:18797:23:16:125:520:209:15:Times:15:Times:Suppose that the rate of growth of dividends is i.i.d., so that today's
11:345:18868:16:17:125:518:193:15:Times:15:Times:state of nature conveys no information as to future dividend, and

11:347:19000:15:15:125:519:161:15:Times:15:Times:price of a tree, p, to be, relative to the "size" y of the economy, a
11:348:19069:15:21:125:519:146:15:Times:15:Times:state-independent constant. Formally, since the assumption of i.i.d.
11:349:19137:21:11:134:520:125:11:Times:11:Times:11As Mehra and Prescott [1985] note, this is not a blatantly counterfactual assumption: the
11:350:19228:11:36:126:520:114:10:Times:10:Times:rate of growth of consumption only exhibits a small negative serial correlation over the period.

12:352:19325:0:24:142:453:714:15:Times:15:Times:dividend growth is equivalent, from (1), to specifying

12:354:19399:31:17:142:535:659:8:Courier:15:Times:itis obvious, from the equilibrium asset pricing formu1 given in
12:355:19463:17:11:143:199:642:15:Times:15:Times:(14), that

12:357:19483:28:14:143:536:603:13:Helvetica:15:Times:i.e.,that the equilibrium price function is simply g = wyg, where w
12:358:19550:14:14:143:536:589:15:Times:15:Times:is a constant determined by substituting (19) into (14); the price-
12:359:19617:14:16:143:481:575:15:Times:15:Times:dividend ratio is a constant when dividend growth is i.i.d.
12:360:19676:16:17:161:537:559:16:Times:16:Times:An immediate implication of (19) is that, with i.i.d. dividend
12:361:19738:17:15:143:538:542:15:Times:15:Times:growth, the average risky and safe rates are state-independent [see
12:362:19805:15:18:143:538:527:16:Times:16:Times:equations (15) and (16)], and so is the equity premium H. Its

12:365:19949:39:17:161:539:432:15:Times:15:Times:From equation (20)12 can be drawn what is possibly the most
12:366:20008:17:16:144:540:415:15:Times:15:Times:striking result of this paper: with i. i. d. dividend growth, the equity
12:367:20080:16:16:144:537:399:15:Times:15:Times:premium, when defined in relative terms, is independent of the IES,
12:368:20147:16:16:144:538:383:15:Times:15:Times:and reflects only the properties of the dividend growth process and,
12:369:20215:16:16:145:385:367:14:Times:14:Times:of course, the magnitude of the CRRA.13
12:370:20254:16:15:162:538:351:15:Times:15:Times:To understand this result, it suffices to remember that, with i.i.d.
12:371:20322:15:17:145:539:336:15:Times:15:Times:uncertainty, optimal consumption is a constant fraction of wealth.'4
12:372:20390:17:16:145:540:319:16:Times:16:Times:The rate of growth of consumption is, therefore, proportional to
12:373:20454:16:15:146:539:303:15:Times:15:Times:R+,, the rate of return on the "market" portfolio [see equation (3)].
12:374:20523:15:16:146:539:288:15:Times:15:Times:As a consequence, the marginal rate of substitution depends only
12:375:20587:16:32:146:420:272:15:Times:15:Times:on R+,, and the Euler equation (3) reduces to
12:376:20632:32:22:280:538:240:15:Times:14:Times:E {RT, Rkg+1} = 1,(21)
12:377:20654:22:11:155:543:218:12:Times:12:Times:'2Note that (20) confirms the interpretation given in the text of i as the coefficient of

12:379:20766:11:12:155:542:196:11:Times:11:Times:13Analogous results have been obtained by Barsky [19861 whithin a two-period framework
12:380:20852:12:10:146:435:184:10:Times:10:Times:based on Selden's [1978] "ordinal certainty equivalence" preferences.
12:381:20921:10:10:155:540:174:10:Times:11:Times:14Preferences are homothetjc —sothat the ratio of consumption to wealth depends, at most,
12:382:21010:10:12:146:542:164:11:Times:11:Times:on the state of nature. Dividend growth is i.i.d., so that this ratio (equal to the marginal and
12:383:21106:12:10:146:541:152:11:Times:11:Times:average propensity to consume) is a constant —becausetoday's state of nature conveys no
12:384:21193:10:46:146:268:142:11:Times:11:Times:information as to the future.

13:386:21224:0:15:127:521:703:15:Times:15:Times:which is the condition characterizing the static optimal portfolio al-
13:387:21294:15:18:127:523:688:16:Times:16:Times:location chosen by au agent with a CRRA equal to 7! Equation
13:388:21354:18:14:128:523:670:15:Times:15:Times:(21) simply establishes'5 that an interteinporal program reduces, in
13:389:21422:14:16:127:522:656:15:Times:15:Times:practice, to a sequence of disconnected static problems when under-
13:390:21489:16:18:127:521:640:16:Times:16:Times:lying uncertainty is i.i.d.'6 But then, it is not surprising that, as
13:391:21558:18:14:127:523:622:15:Times:15:Times:equation (20) shows, the risk premium on equity depends only (for
13:392:21623:14:16:127:521:608:15:Times:14:Times:a given output process) on 'y, and that p be irrelevantsince in-
13:393:21687:16:18:128:523:592:15:Times:15:Times:tertemporal considerations play no role in the determination of the
13:394:21754:18:13:127:362:574:15:Times:15:Times:optimal program with i.i.d. uncertainty.
13:395:21794:13:16:145:522:561:15:Times:15:Times:While this result confirms the intuitive argument presented supra
13:396:21859:16:16:128:523:545:16:Times:16:Times:(the CRRA controls the risk premium, and the IES the level of
13:397:21920:16:17:128:521:529:15:Times:15:Times:the riskfree rate), it also proves very decisively that relaxing the
13:398:21988:17:16:128:524:512:15:Times:15:Times:time-additive expected utility restriction cannot possibly help solve
13:399:22057:16:14:128:523:496:15:Times:15:Times:the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle when dividend growth
13:400:22118:14:16:128:523:482:15:Times:15:Times:is i.i.d. For any y, the equity premium is the same irrespective of
13:401:22185:16:16:128:523:466:14:Times:14:Times:whether p is equal to or different from y ,i.e.,irrespective of whether
13:402:22256:16:15:128:512:450:15:Times:15:Times:the expected, time-additive utility restriction is satisfied or not
13:403:22323:15:17:128:521:435:15:Times:15:Times:Therefore, allowing attitudes towards risk to be parametrized inde-
13:404:22390:17:15:128:523:418:15:Times:15:Times:pendently from behavior towards intertemporal substitution cannot,
13:405:22456:15:16:128:524:403:14:Times:14:Times:with i.i.d. dividend growth, afford any improvement whatsoever over
13:406:22523:16:16:129:522:387:15:Times:15:Times:the results of Mehra and Prescott: independently of the value one
13:407:22588:16:18:128:523:371:16:Times:16:Times:might want to select for p (the inverse of the IES), one wiU still
13:408:22654:18:14:129:522:353:15:Times:15:Times:need implausibly (of the order of 40) high values of 'y (the CRRA)
13:409:22720:14:16:129:522:339:14:Times:15:Times:to replicate the observed 6.20 %riskpremium on equity. The equity
13:410:22785:16:16:129:524:323:14:Times:14:Times:premium puzzle ("why is the risk premium so large if consumers are
13:411:22851:16:16:129:430:307:15:Times:15:Times:only moderately risk averse?") thus remains intact.
13:412:22902:16:16:146:523:291:15:Times:15:Times:Another implication of the foregoing results is that relaxing, for
13:413:22968:16:15:129:523:275:15:Times:15:Times:a given y, the time-additive expected utility restriction in the di-
13:414:23036:15:16:129:524:260:15:Times:15:Times:rection of more plausible parameter values might, while leaving the
13:415:23103:16:16:129:524:244:15:Times:15:Times:equity premium unchanged, deteriorate the ability of the model to
13:416:23168:16:16:129:525:228:16:Times:16:Times:replicate the level of the riskfree rate. It is commonly estimated
13:417:23234:16:19:130:525:212:15:Times:15:Times:that the CRRA is in the range of 1 to 5, with both theoretical (Ar-

13:419:23369:13:16:130:527:180:15:Times:15:Times:that it is in fact closer to 1. The implied values for the IES under

14:424:23658:0:16:137:531:707:15:Times:15:Times:to the belief that consumers are in fact very averse to intertemporal
14:425:23727:16:16:137:530:691:15:Times:15:Times:substitution, and thus seem to overestimate the "true" intertempo-
14:426:23793:16:16:137:531:675:15:Times:15:Times:ral elasticity of substitution (i.e., underestimate the "true" p). But
14:427:23863:16:18:137:529:659:15:Times:15:Times:it is easy to show [from (16) and the assumption of i.i.d. growthj
14:428:23929:18:14:137:530:641:15:Times:15:Times:that increasing p while maintaining y fixed may very well result,
14:429:23994:14:16:137:532:627:15:Times:15:Times:depending on the specification of the output process, in an increase
14:430:24062:16:15:137:532:611:15:Times:15:Times:in the predicted riskfree rate far over and above the already too high
14:431:24132:15:16:137:532:596:15:Times:15:Times:levels associated with the expected utility restriction! That this is

14:436:24428:14:16:138:531:517:14:Times:14:Times:of a new puzzle, focused on the riskfree rate: "why is it, if consumers
14:437:24499:16:16:138:531:501:15:Times:15:Times:are so averse to consumption fluctuations, that the riskfree rate is
14:438:24567:16:16:138:186:485:14:Times:14:Times:so low?"
14:439:24575:16:16:156:530:469:16:Times:16:Times:I now turn to a numerical examination of the non-i.i.d. case,
14:440:24636:16:35:138:438:453:15:Times:15:Times:which confirms and amplifies the preceding results.

14:443:24792:16:16:139:532:378:15:Times:15:Times:to resort to numerical methods to solve for the equilibrium price

14:446:24939:16:19:156:534:331:16:Times:16:Times:Mehra and Prescott observe that the evolution of the rate of

15:471:26112:15:16:127:522:496:15:Times:15:Times:creasing the intertemporal elasticity of substitution amounts to in-

15:474:26317:15:16:127:520:449:15:Times:15:Times:erty at the origin of the "dilemma" faced by Mehra and Prescott.
15:475:26381:16:17:127:523:433:15:Times:15:Times:The largest risk premium one can obtain under these circumstances
15:476:26446:17:16:127:522:416:15:Times:15:Times:in that parameter range is 2.33 %, a magnitude which not only falls
15:477:26513:16:16:127:522:400:14:Times:14:Times:far short of the observed 6.25 %, but also is associated with a riskfree
15:478:26585:16:17:127:405:384:15:Times:15:Times:rate way too large (17.87 % instead of 6.25 %)!
15:479:26632:17:16:145:521:367:15:Times:15:Times:Relaxing the restriction p = 'y improves matters only slightly.
15:480:26695:16:14:128:520:351:15:Times:15:Times:For any intertemporal elasticity of substitution l/p, increasing the
15:481:26763:14:16:128:521:337:15:Times:15:Times:coefficient of relative risk aversion y raises the risk premium and
15:482:26830:16:16:128:522:321:15:Times:15:Times:lowers the riskfree rate. For any coefficient of relative risk aversion

15:484:26970:16:16:128:346:289:15:Times:15:Times:riskfree rate, and the risk premium.'8
15:485:27008:16:16:145:521:273:15:Times:15:Times:This last result is very troublesome, in light of the fact that the
15:486:27075:16:16:128:522:257:15:Times:15:Times:riskfree rate is very sensitive, while the risk premium reacts very
15:487:27142:16:17:128:523:241:15:Times:15:Times:little, to declines in the IES.19 It implies, as suggested above, that
15:488:27212:17:20:128:523:224:15:Times:15:Times:abandoning the time-additive expected utility restriction to adopt
15:489:27278:20:11:137:524:204:11:Times:11:Times:'TA subjective discount rate, /3, closer to 1 improves the ability of the model to replicate the
15:490:27374:11:10:129:524:193:10:Times:11:Times:levelofthe riskfree rate, but only marginally so in light of the magnitude of the discrepancy
15:491:27467:10:11:129:335:183:11:Times:11:Times:between the predicted and observed magnitudes.
15:492:27513:11:11:138:525:172:10:Times:10:Times:18While the explanation of the first effect is straightforward in each of these two comparative
15:493:27608:11:11:129:523:161:11:Times:11:Times:statics general equilibrium experiments, the rationale of the second result is more obscure.
15:494:27700:11:11:129:495:150:11:Times:11:Times:These results are moreover not independent of the specification of the output process.
15:495:27786:11:10:138:524:139:11:Times:11:Times:19The rationale for those different reactions is, of course, that dividend growth is almost
15:496:27877:10:47:129:348:129:12:Times:10:Times:i.i.d. for the case 4'=422 = 0.43 considered here.
15:497:27927:47:0:321:332:82:11:Times:11:Times:13
16:498:27929:0:16:142:535:687:15:Times:15:Times:more "plausible" parameter values in fact worsens the ability of the
16:499:27997:16:16:142:539:671:15:Times:15:Times:model to replicate historical rates. As Table I demonstrates, relaxing
16:500:28067:16:16:143:537:655:15:Times:15:Times:the p = y restriction in the direction of "more realism" (a smaller
16:501:28134:16:16:143:537:639:15:Times:15:Times:IES, i.e., p > y) will, for any reasonable coefficient of relative risk
16:502:28205:16:18:143:539:623:15:Times:15:Times:aversion., dramatically increase the risk-free rate beyond its already
16:503:28275:18:14:143:537:605:15:Times:15:Times:large value, while only slightly increasing the risk premium. For
16:504:28340:14:15:143:537:591:15:Times:15:Times:instance, for -y = 1 (logarithmic risk preferences), the predicted risk
16:505:28411:15:16:143:536:576:16:Times:16:Times:premium is 0.12 % for i/p = 1 (i.e., when the VNM restriction
16:506:28472:16:16:143:536:560:16:Times:16:Times:is satisfied), and 0.45 % when i/p = 0.1 (the value estimated by
16:507:28536:16:15:143:538:544:16:Times:16:Times:Epstein and Zin [1987b]): both magnitudes fall far short of the
16:508:28599:15:16:143:536:529:14:Times:13:Helvetica:observed 6.2 %.Asfor the riskfree rate, it rises from 7.03 %when
16:509:28663:16:18:144:353:513:15:Times:15:Times:i/p = 1 to 24.91 % when i/p = 0.1!
16:510:28697:18:16:161:537:495:14:Times:14:Times:One must., therefore, conclude that, for empirically calibrated pa-
16:511:28764:16:14:143:537:479:15:Times:15:Times:rameter values, the "equity premium puzzle" is in fact compounded
16:512:28829:14:19:143:537:465:15:Times:15:Times:by a "riskfree rate" puzzle, which the use of the Kreps-Porteus pref-
16:513:28898:19:13:143:536:446:15:Times:15:Times:erences (4) and (5) helped bring into light: why is it, if agents are
16:514:28967:13:16:143:538:433:15:Times:15:Times:as averse to intertemporal substitution as most empirical estimates
16:515:29034:16:16:143:537:417:14:Times:14:Times:suggest they are, that the riskfree rate is so much lower than the rep-
16:516:29105:16:18:143:539:401:15:Times:15:Times:resentative agent, complete market model predicts it should be?2°
16:517:29170:18:13:143:536:383:14:Times:14:Times:Abandoning time-additive expected utility thus deepens the mystery
16:518:29236:13:36:143:473:370:15:Times:15:Times:and extends the puzzle outlined by Mehra and Prescott.
16:519:29290:36:31:144:217:334:16:Times:16:Times:Conclusion
16:520:29300:31:16:144:544:303:15:Times:15:Times:This paper has studied the implications for general equilibrium asset.
16:521:29370:16:16:143:536:287:14:Times:14:Times:pricing of a recently introduced class of Kreps-Porteus non-expected
16:522:29438:16:16:143:536:271:15:Times:15:Times:utility preferences, which is characterized by a constant intertempo-
16:523:29507:16:14:143:538:255:15:Times:15:Times:ral elasticity of substitution and a constant, but unrelated, coeffi-
16:524:29576:14:17:143:315:241:14:Times:14:Times:cient of relative risk aversion.
16:525:29608:17:16:161:536:224:15:Times:14:Times:It has been shown that the solution to the "equity premiumpuz-
16:526:29670:16:16:143:538:208:15:Times:15:Times:zle" documented by Mehra and Prescott [1985] cannot be found by
16:527:29733:16:21:143:537:192:15:Times:15:Times:simply separating risk aversion for intertemporal substitution. If
16:528:29799:21:10:152:536:171:11:Times:11:Times:20Table I shows that the riskfree rate puzzle survives, but less strikingly, if one believes
16:529:29891:10:12:143:536:161:11:Times:11:Times:that the IES is not as small (0.1) as the estimates of Epstein and Zin suggest. The issue is,
16:530:29984:12:10:143:535:149:11:Times:10:Times:of course, which weight to attach to an aggregate estimate of the IES which implies avery
16:531:30073:10:11:143:538:139:11:Times:11:Times:negative interest elasticity of savings, and is thus in conflict with life-cycle estimates (which
16:532:30170:11:11:143:537:128:10:Times:10:Times:point to an almost zero aggregate interest elasticity of savings). Its resolution, which obviously
16:533:30268:11:8:143:538:117:11:Times:11:Times:involves questions related to Ricardian equivalence and bequest motives, is outside the scope
16:534:30361:8:42:143:343:109:11:Times:10:Times:of this paper —whichis aggregative by design.

17:536:30408:0:16:131:524:704:15:Times:15:Times:the dividend growth proccss is i.i.d, the risk premium, wlicii ap-
17:537:30474:16:14:130:525:688:15:Times:15:Times:propriately defined, is independent of the intertemporal elasticity
17:538:30541:14:16:130:524:674:16:Times:16:Times:of substitution, and thus is be the same whether or not the time-
17:539:30606:16:16:131:526:658:15:Times:15:Times:additive, expected utility restriction is imposed. When the dividend
17:540:30674:16:18:131:525:642:14:Times:14:Times:growth process is non-i.i.d., relaxing the par restriction on tastes im-
17:541:30746:18:13:131:525:624:14:Times:14:Times:plicit in the time-additive expected utility specification and adopting
17:542:30817:13:17:131:525:611:15:Times:15:Times:Kreps-Porteus preferences in the direction of 'more realism' adds, if
17:543:30886:17:19:131:525:594:15:Times:15:Times:anything, a "riskfree rate puzzle" to Mehra's and Prescott's 'equity
17:544:30954:19:12:131:234:575:15:Times:15:Times:premium puzzle."
17:545:30970:12:17:149:526:563:15:Times:15:Times:From here, research may proceed into two directions. On the one
17:546:31033:17:16:131:525:546:15:Times:15:Times:hand, one might examine the further implications of the generaliza-
17:547:31100:16:16:132:527:530:14:Times:14:Times:tion of CES preferences achieved by Epstein-Zin [1987a] and myself
17:548:31166:16:14:133:526:514:15:Times:15:Times:[1987]. It is likely, as this paper already suggests, that the relaxing
17:549:31237:14:17:132:524:500:15:Times:15:Times:the time-additive, expected utility restriction will not solve all as-
17:550:31307:17:15:132:526:483:15:Times:15:Times:set pricing and consumption theory puzzles. it might solve some of
17:551:31373:15:17:132:526:468:15:Times:15:Times:them, but one should not delude oneself into thinking that it will
17:552:31439:17:16:132:526:451:15:Times:15:Times:solve all of them; market imperfections undoubtedly submerge, in
17:553:31503:16:15:133:527:435:15:Times:15:Times:terms of empirical effects, the biases introduced this particular mis-
17:554:31573:15:17:133:525:420:15:Times:15:Times:specification of preferences. On the other hand, one might concen-
17:555:31639:17:15:133:527:403:15:Times:15:Times:trate on elucidating Mehra's and Prescott's "equity premium puz-
17:556:31703:15:17:133:527:388:15:Times:15:Times:zle" and the "riskiree rate puzzle" highlighted in this paper. As sug-
17:557:31773:17:14:133:526:371:15:Times:15:Times:gested by recent work by Constantinides [1987] and Mason [1987]
17:558:31836:14:17:133:529:357:15:Times:15:Times:on habit formation, it might well be the case that other classes of
17:559:31903:17:16:133:527:340:15:Times:15:Times:preferences than the one explored in this paper might explain the
17:560:31968:16:16:133:527:324:15:Times:15:Times:puzzles explored in this study. But it is likely that market imper-
17:561:32035:16:16:134:528:308:16:Times:16:Times:fections will, in the end, empirically hold center stage: both the
17:562:32101:16:16:134:528:292:15:Times:15:Times:equity premium and riskfree rate puzzles could be explained, for in-
17:563:32169:16:16:134:527:276:15:Times:15:Times:stance, by introducing undiversifiable idiosyncratic risk. The issue
17:564:32237:16:16:134:527:260:15:Times:15:Times:is, of course, to find a theoretically adequate way of rationalizing
17:565:32305:16:125:135:440:244:14:Times:14:Times:and explaining the presence of such imperfections.21
