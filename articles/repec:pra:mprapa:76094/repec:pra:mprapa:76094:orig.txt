2:24:694:14:13:90:93:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
2:25:694:13:21:90:508:499:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  test  an  argument,  drawn  from  transaction  cost  economics,  that  an  assumption  of 
2:26:788:21:21:90:508:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intentional trust should be replaced with one of supplier opportunism in public sector 
2:27:874:21:21:90:508:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  and contract  management.  We  use  structural  equation  modelling  to 
2:28:958:21:20:90:508:436:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evaluate  quantitative  evidence from  180  public  and  private  sector  buyers  on  the 
2:29:1047:20:21:90:507:416:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perceived   effectiveness   of   various   management control   mechanisms   aimed   at 
2:30:1134:21:21:90:507:395:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:restraining  supplier  opportunism.  Our  findings  suggest  that  supplier opportunism  is 
2:31:1225:21:20:90:508:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potentially   a   problem   and   that   certain   procurement   and   contract   management 
2:32:1317:20:21:90:508:354:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms  can  assist  buying  organisations  in  moderating  that  opportunism.  This 
2:33:1406:21:21:90:508:333:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:supports arguments in favour of a ‘cautious approach’ to procurement and contract 
2:34:1487:21:20:90:157:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management.

3:38:1560:0:20:90:158:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Introduction 
3:39:1572:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  many  countries,  the outsourcing of public  services to  the  private  sector is 
3:40:1655:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accelerating  (Torres  and  Pina, 2001;  Batley  and  Larbey,  2004;  Mulgan,  2005;  Hart, 
3:41:1747:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2007). This acceleration is often justified on the basis that private sector providers can 
3:42:1836:20:21:90:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deliver at least the same quality of services as their public sector counterparts but for a 
3:43:1926:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerably  lower  price  (Julius,  2008),  although  numerous  claims have  been  made 
3:44:2016:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against  this  argument (for  example, Grimshaw  et  al.,  2002; Pollock,  2006;  Davies, 
3:45:2105:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2008, 2010).  One  consequence  of  this  increasing  use  of  the  private  sector  is  that 
3:46:2199:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  and  contract  management  is  ever  more important to  public  sector 
3:47:2282:21:21:90:157:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management. 
3:48:2293:21:20:90:93:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
3:49:2293:20:21:90:507:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However,  it  would  be  wrong  to  assume  that  there  is  a  settled  consensus  on  what 
3:50:2386:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constitutes  effective public  sector procurement  and  contract  management,  not  least 
3:51:2474:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:when  it  comes  to the  emphasis  that  should  be  placed  upon intentional trust  in  the 
3:52:2564:20:21:90:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  and  contract  management  process,  as  against using  the  process  to 
3:53:2650:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mitigate potential  supplier  opportunism (for  example,  Grimsey  and  Lewis,  2004; 
3:54:2734:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bovaird, 2006; The Author et al, 2010). The debate over this issue is crucial, as clarity 
3:55:2819:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over  the  challenges and  objectives  of  the  procurement  and  contract  management 
3:56:2905:21:21:90:371:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:process is critical to the delivery of satisfactory outcomes. 
3:57:2966:21:21:90:93:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
3:58:2966:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  this  article,  the  authors contribute  to  this  debate  by  reporting  on the procurement 
3:59:3061:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and contract management practices of public and private sector organisations and the 
3:60:3143:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perceived outcomes   of   those practices.   In   particular, we   consider quantitative 
3:61:3230:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evidence  on  the  perceived  effectiveness  of various  buy-side  management  control 
3:62:3316:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms aimed at    restraining    supplier    opportunism,    when    transaction 
3:63:3402:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics  make  opportunism  a  possibility.  We  test  three  hypotheses,  derived 
3:64:3493:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  the  literature,  particularly  Williamson  (1985  and  1996), in  pursuit  of  this 
3:65:3583:20:21:90:186:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:research objective.  
3:66:3603:21:21:90:93:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
3:67:3603:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:First, we hypothesize that  the  more a  transaction is hazardous the  less  extensive  the 
3:68:3690:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management  control  mechanisms  will  be. Second,  we hypothesize that an increased 
3:69:3774:20:21:90:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensiveness of management control mechanisms will reduce incidences  of supplier 
3:70:3856:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism.  Finally,  we  test  a  hypothesis  concerning  the  relationship  between 
3:71:3944:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction  characteristics  and  supplier  opportunism,  both  with  and  without  the 
4:72:4034:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intervening  variable  of  management  control  mechanisms. This  is  again  to  assess  the 
4:73:4126:20:21:90:305:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact of management control mechanisms. 
4:74:4166:21:21:90:93:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
4:75:4166:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The quantitative data used to test these hypotheses is derived from 180 questionnaire 
4:76:4251:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:responses  provided  by  procurement professionals working  in buying  organisations. 
4:77:4336:21:21:90:507:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The   questionnaire   asked   respondents   to   classify   a procurement   and contract 
4:78:4425:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management   situation   in   terms   of   the   transaction   characteristics,   report   on 
4:79:4519:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  and  contract  management  actions  taken  in  the  situation  and  then  report 
4:80:4612:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perceptions  of  the outcome in  terms  of  incidences  of  supplier  opportunism.  The 
4:81:4698:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sample  included  both  public  and  private  sector  respondents,  allowing  a  public  sector 
4:82:4794:21:20:90:475:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dummy variable to be included to measure differences between the two sectors.

4:84:4871:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The article is organised as follows: section two briefly discusses the literature dealing 
4:85:4960:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with intentional trust, opportunism and  management  control  mechanisms;  section 
4:86:5041:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:three describes  the  methodology adopted;  section four reports  the  results of  our 
4:87:5125:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hypothesis  testing; section five concludes  with  a  summary  of  key  results and a 
4:88:5209:21:20:90:361:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:discussion of their implications for theory and practice.

4:90:5262:21:21:90:441:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Trust and Opportunism in Procurement and Contract Management 
4:91:5322:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There is  a critical debate within the public sector management literature, reflecting  a 
4:92:5412:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:similar  debate  in  the  wider  management  literature, over  the  emphasis  that  should  be 
4:93:5507:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:placed  upon  intentional  trust  in  the  procurement  and  contract  management  process 
4:94:5598:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(for example, Walsh, 1995; Lane 1999; Bovaird and Halachmi, 2001; Grimshaw et al, 
4:95:5680:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2002; Huxham, 2003; Coulson, 2005; Watt, 2005; Bovaird, 2006; Reeves, 2008; The 
4:96:5758:20:21:90:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Author  et  al,  2010). Intentional  trust is  defined  as  the  expectation  of  one  party  to  an 
4:97:5858:21:21:90:507:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  that  the  other  party  will  not  take  advantage  of  commercial  vulnerabilities 
4:98:5953:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:even  when  there  is  an  incentive  to  do  so  (Nooteboom,  2002). This  is  distinct  from 
4:99:6048:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competence  trust (Sako,  1992),  which  is  an  equally  important  concept,  but  not  the 
4:100:6140:21:21:90:188:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:focus of this article. 
4:101:6162:21:21:90:93:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
4:102:6162:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This particular debate  does  not  concern  the  benefits  of intentional trust, should  it  be 
4:103:6254:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:successfully  created.  These  have  been  well  charted  and  agreed  upon  in  the  literature 
4:104:6351:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  include  reduced  transaction  costs  (search  costs,  negotiation  costs,  contracting 
4:105:6444:21:0:90:507:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:costs  and  monitoring  costs)  and  an  increased  level  of  value  creation  (Chiles  and 
5:106:6538:0:20:90:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:McMakin,  1996).  The  debate  is  more  about  the  feasibility  of  its  creation and  about 
5:107:6632:20:21:90:385:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:how its absence in a purchase situation should be addressed.  
5:108:6693:21:21:90:93:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:109:6693:21:20:90:505:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  are  many  that  contend  that the  creation  of  intentional  trust  within  buyer-
5:110:6783:20:21:90:505:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supplier   relationships   is   eminently   feasible   and   can   then   facilitate   the   above-
5:111:6882:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mentioned lower transaction costs and increased value creation. The reasoning behind 
5:112:6967:21:20:90:511:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this is varied, but covers benign views about human nature (Ghoshal and Moran, 1996; 
5:113:7052:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Casey,  2003),  the  identification  of  national  cultures  that  facilitate  communitarian 
5:114:7145:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:beliefs and actions (Lane and Bachmann, 1996), contentions that it is possible to both 
5:115:7232:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:profit  from  and  signal intentional trustworthiness  (Ugoji  et  al,  2007)  and  arguments 
5:116:7326:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that stress the social obligations and confidence that arise out of repeated interactions 
5:117:7416:20:21:90:167:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Gulati, 1995).  
5:118:7432:21:21:90:93:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:119:7432:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Beyond  these  ideas  about  the  creation  of intentional trust are  a  number  of related 
5:120:7524:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actions believed to enhance the potential for trust to be maintained over time. First, it 
5:121:7612:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is  argued  that  managers  should  refrain  from  aggressive  and  controlling  behaviour 
5:122:7703:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:during   pre-contractual   negotiations.   Such   behaviour,   it   is   argued,   is   likely   to 
5:123:7802:20:21:90:508:407:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:encourage ‘tit-for-tat’ behaviour, as modelled by the prisoner’s dilemma (Axelrod and 
5:124:7887:21:21:90:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Hamilton, 1981). Second, it is argued that managers should clearly communicate their 
5:125:7972:21:21:90:505:365:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:‘interests’ to the other party so as to reduce the chance of misunderstandings and ill-
5:126:8055:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:feeling  (Kinnaird  and  Movius,  2008).  As  Hobbes  observed  over  three  centuries  ago, 
5:127:8148:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aggressive  actions  are  often  not  a  product  of  wickedness  but  of  fear  and ignorance

5:130:8256:20:21:90:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Third, some  argue  that formal  contracts  are  incompatible  with intentional trust  and 
5:131:8345:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should be avoided, where possible (Boyne (1998). Malhotra and Murnighan (2002, p. 
5:132:8424:21:20:90:508:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:553), for example, state that formal, binding contracts ‘crowd out’ intentional trust as 
5:133:8513:20:21:90:508:200:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:they affect an individual’s ‘underlying attributional processes’. A variant on this is 
5:134:8600:21:21:90:507:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  formal  contracts can  co-habit with intentional trust,  but only  if  they  are  not too 
5:135:8693:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:restrictive (Bovaird and Halachmi, 2001; Forder et al.,2004; Hughes and Rayer, 2009; 
5:136:8777:21:20:90:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bertrandias et al, 2010). Finally, it is said that managers  from the two parties should 
5:137:8865:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adopt  established  techniques  to  enhance  and  maintain  intentional  trust,  including 
5:138:8956:21:0:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:feedback  loops  (Huxham,  2003),  supplier  reward  schemes  (The  Authors,  2007), 
6:139:9042:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:buyer-supplier  forums, aimed  at  performance  improvements  (Hines,  1994), and 
6:140:9122:20:21:90:447:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dispute resolution mechanisms (Office of Government Commerce, 2002).

6:142:9190:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Once intentional trust has been developed, it is argued that it can be a mechanism for 
6:143:9277:20:21:90:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:making  contracts, which  may  already  be  of  a  ‘general  clause’  or  ‘relational’  type 
6:144:9370:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Williamson,  1985;  Macneil,  1978), self-enforcing. Suppliers  deliver  upon  their 
6:145:9454:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:promises  and,  where  relevant,  deal  fairly  with  the  consequences  of  uncertainty, 
6:146:9544:20:21:90:504:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because they feel a social obligation to do so (Granovetter, 1985; Nooteboom, 2002).  
6:147:9629:21:21:90:93:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
6:148:9629:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Others  within  this  debate,  however,  are  less  optimistic.  Williamson,  for  example, 
6:149:9720:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rejects  the  usefulness  of  the  concept  of intentional trust.  He  believes  instead  that  the 
6:150:9820:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economics of contracts should be based upon an assumption of supplier opportunism 
6:151:9900:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  involves a  cautious  approach (Williamson,  1993). This approach  is  said  to  hold 
6:152:9988:21:20:90:507:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:even if it is believed that relationships based on trust can and do exist between buyers 
6:153:10074:20:21:90:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  suppliers. This  is  because,  even  if  you  believe  only a  significant  minority  of 
6:154:10166:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suppliers  are  prone  to  opportunistic  actions,  it  is hard  to  tell ex  ante  which  those  are 
6:155:10266:21:20:90:192:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Williamson, 1993).  
6:156:10285:20:21:90:93:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
6:157:10285:21:21:90:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  concept  of  opportunism  in  economics  is  understood  as  self-interest  seeking 
6:158:10374:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actions  that  go  beyond  the  traditional  neo-classical  concept  of  simple  self-interest 
6:159:10469:21:20:90:511:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seeking (Williamson, 1985). These actions can either be blatant or subtle (Williamson, 
6:160:10555:20:21:90:126:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1996).  
6:161:10562:21:21:90:93:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
6:162:10562:21:20:90:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A key type of blatant opportunism is the hold-up problem, which can be defined as a 
6:163:10644:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:situation  where  a  supplier  refuses  to  continue  to  supply,  or  to  supply  at  a  particular 
6:164:10745:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:level  of  performance,  unless  its increased  demands  are  met.  This  threat  can  be 
6:165:10835:21:20:90:508:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:credible in situations where the buyer’s ability to switch to alternative suppliers is 
6:166:10922:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constrained  by  either  time  or  the  relationship-specific  investments  it  has  made.  The 
6:167:11018:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problem is particularly serious when a contract is characterised by uncertainty as this 
6:168:11104:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will force a buying organisation to sign an incomplete contract, one that is completed 
6:169:11190:21:20:90:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:through  negotiations  during  the  contract  period.  If  the  buyer’s  ability  to  switch  is 
6:170:11287:20:21:90:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:constrained by its making of relationship-specific investments, it may well undertake 
6:171:11373:21:21:90:387:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:those negotiations from a weak position (The Author, 2005).  
6:172:11433:21:0:90:93:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:173:11434:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Key   types   of   subtle   opportunism   include   adverse   selection and   moral   hazard 
7:174:11526:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Milgrom  and  Roberts,  1992).  Adverse  selection is  defined  as  a  situation  where, 
7:175:11616:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because  of  a  lack  of  information,  a  buying  organisation  pays  a  price  for  a  good  or 
7:176:11714:21:20:90:511:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:service that is based upon an erroneous belief about the quality of that good or service. 
7:177:11804:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:In  such  a  scenario,  the  supplier,  of  course,  deliberately  fails  to  address the buyer’s 
7:178:11902:21:21:90:507:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lack   of   necessary   information. Moral   hazard is a   situation   where   a   supplier 
7:179:11992:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:underperforms in order to improve its profits on a contract, safe in the knowledge that 
7:180:12080:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the buyer finds it difficult to monitor its performance. Two common manifestations of 
7:181:12163:21:21:90:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:moral  hazard  are  shirking  and  quality  shading  (Milgrom  and  Roberts,  1992; The 
7:182:12251:21:21:90:168:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Authors, 2007).

7:184:12266:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Amongst   those   reasons   cited   for   the   existence   of   opportunism   in   business 
7:185:12359:21:21:90:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationships are frailties in human nature (Williamson, 1985), individualistic national 
7:186:12446:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:culture  (Lane  and  Bachmann,  1996),  adverse  business  circumstances  (Nooteboom, 
7:187:12532:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2002)  and  amoral  business  education  (Ghoshal  and  Moran,  1996),  as  well  as 
7:188:12617:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction complexity, uncertainty,    asset    specificity    and    credence    qualities

7:191:12728:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  terms  of  how,  at  a  high  level, managers  should  cope  with  the  existence  of 
7:192:12817:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunistic  intent  in  a  significant  minority  of  suppliers,  a cautious approach  has 
7:193:12910:21:20:90:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been   advanced,   involving   the   employment   of   extensive   management   control 
7:194:12998:20:21:90:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms  (Williamson,  1985  and  1996;  Anderson  and  Dekker,  2005).  First, it  is 
7:195:13087:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:said that buy-side managers should carefully research and agree upon both their own 
7:196:13166:21:20:90:508:282:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:organisation’s purchase requirements and the capabilities and reputation of the supply 
7:197:13251:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market (Hughes and Dickson, 2009). Second, and following this, it is said that the two 
7:198:13336:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:parties  should,  following  careful  negotiation, contract  formally  in  the  first  instance 
7:199:13431:21:20:90:335:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:and then look to ‘keep the contract in the drawer’.  
7:200:13483:20:21:90:93:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
7:201:13483:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Contracting formally means, in the manner of Klein (1996), developing legal clauses 
7:202:13566:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where   the   absence   of   uncertainty   makes   it   possible   and   developing   private 
7:203:13660:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enforcement  capital  where  the  presence  of  uncertainty  means  it  is  not. ‘Keeping the 
7:204:13753:20:21:90:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract  in  the  drawer’ does  not  mean  ignoring  the  contractual  provisions,  but  rather 
7:205:13849:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:translating them into a set of working procedures, understandings and expectations. If 
7:206:13936:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:monitoring subsequently reveals that these are not being adhered to then this will see 
8:207:14021:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  legal  specifics  of  the  contract  being  reintroduced. Third,  buy-side  managers 
8:208:14110:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should  retain  an  awareness  of  the  role  reputation  can  play  in  a  cautious  approach 
8:209:14205:21:21:90:222:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Bowles and Gintis, 1999). 
8:210:14231:21:20:90:93:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:211:14231:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Those who adhere  to  this cautious approach (for  example,  Czerniawska  and  Smith, 
8:212:14314:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2010) believe that,   contrary   to   the   arguments   of,   for   example,   Malhotra   and 
8:213:14408:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Murnighan  (2002),  the  best  chance  of  developing  a  relationship underpinned  by 
8:214:14494:20:21:90:507:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intentional  trust is through establishing  at  the  outset  a  clear  and  detailed  legal 
8:215:14585:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agreement. The reasoning behind this is that such an agreement reduces the scope for 
8:216:14670:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:misunderstandings and reduces the fear of receiving the ‘sucker’s pay-off’. The  idea 
8:217:14755:21:20:90:508:551:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:of a contract ‘crowding out’ intentional trust is not recognised by this approach, not 
8:218:14842:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:least as it is believed that managers respect the other party’s requirement for security. 
8:219:14932:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Furthermore, even when such an agreement does not promote intentional trust, it still 
8:220:15018:21:20:90:257:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provides the basis for compliance. 
8:221:15052:20:21:90:93:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:222:15052:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For  this  group,  therefore,  fear  of  opportunism  suggests a  need  for caution  in 
8:223:15140:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement and contract management, with extensive management control structures 
8:224:15221:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suggested,  especially in  the  case  of potentially hazardous transactions  (Forder  et  al., 
8:225:15314:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2004; Anderson and Dekker, 2005). Proponents of this cautious approach do not deny 
8:226:15396:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that this approach imposes higher transaction costs. Nor do they deny that it can cause 
8:227:15483:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:buying   organisations to miss numerous opportunities   to   develop productive 
8:228:15562:20:21:90:511:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationships with suppliers that had no intention of acting opportunistically. However, 
8:229:15651:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they argue that these costs are outweighed by the prospect of lower opportunism costs 
8:230:15735:21:20:90:181:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over the long run.  
8:231:15754:20:21:90:93:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:232:15754:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Having  outlined  the  relevant  parts of  the  debate  over intentional  trust, supplier 
8:233:15842:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism and their management, we now proceed to present quantitative evidence 
8:234:15922:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on   public   and   private   sector   procurement   and   contract   management   practice. 
8:235:16014:21:21:90:505:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Specifically, we aim to  investigate  the  contention  in  the  literature  that various  buy-
8:236:16106:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:side    management    control    mechanisms    are    effective    at    restraining    supplier 
8:237:16203:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism, when transaction characteristics make opportunism a possibility. In that 
8:238:16288:20:21:90:421:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sense, we are investigating the cautious approach introduced above.  
8:239:16354:21:21:90:93:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
8:240:16354:21:0:90:93:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:241:16355:0:20:90:160:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Methodology 
9:242:16366:20:21:90:507:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In this study, we tested three hypotheses derived from the literature (see Figure 1) in 
9:243:16449:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pursuit  of our research  objective. The first  hypothesis  concerns the  relationship 
9:244:16533:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between  transaction  characteristics  and management  control  mechanisms  and  posits 
9:245:16621:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  the  more  a  transaction is  hazardous the  less  extensive the  management  control 
9:246:16711:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms   will   be.   The   reasoning   behind   this   hypothesis   is   that   extensive 
9:247:16806:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:knowledge of purchase requirements, communication of that knowledge to suppliers, 
9:248:16888:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:knowledge    of    pricing, monitoring,    negotiation, contract drafting, and the

9:290:17767:21:20:90:508:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The   second   hypothesis   concerns   the   relationship   between management   control 
9:291:17855:20:21:90:508:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms  and  incidences  of  supplier  opportunism, and  posits that  increases  in  the 
9:292:17947:21:21:90:508:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensiveness of management control mechanisms will reduce incidences of supplier 
9:293:18025:21:20:90:508:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism (Williamson, 1985; Milgrom and Roberts, 1992; Anderson and Dekker, 
9:294:18103:20:21:90:409:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2005). That is, it posits that a cautious approach will be effective.  
9:295:18167:21:21:90:93:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:296:18167:21:21:90:508:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The third hypothesis concerns the relationship between transaction characteristics and 
9:297:18253:21:20:90:508:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supplier opportunism, both with and without the intervening variable of management 
9:298:18335:20:0:90:508:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:control  mechanisms.  This hypothesis  was  advanced  to  provide  a  further  test  of  the 
10:299:18429:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact  of management  control  mechanisms  on  supplier  opportunism.  We  test  the 
10:300:18514:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argument  that  more  hazardous  transaction  characteristics  will  lead  to  increased 
10:301:18603:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incidences  of  supplier  opportunism,  but  that  this  outcome  will  be  influenced  by  the 
10:302:18699:21:20:90:338:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensiveness of management control mechanisms.

10:304:18745:21:21:90:507:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We undertook tests of the hypotheses using structural equation modelling (SEM) and 
10:305:18826:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:LISREL  8.8  (Jöreskog  and  Sörbom, 2006).i The  characteristics  of  the  sample  that 
10:306:18913:20:21:90:482:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:facilitated the tests and the variable measures used in the tests are now described.

10:308:18996:21:21:90:164:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sample details 
10:309:19010:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  quantitative  evidence  used  to  conduct  the  investigation  is  from  180  responses 
10:310:19103:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:provided   by procurement   (that   is,   buy-side)   professionals to   a   cross-sectional 
10:311:19194:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:questionnaire survey. Most of the respondents filled out the questionnaire while at the 
10:312:19280:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:authors’  institution  attending  some  form  of  procurement-related event;  a smaller 
10:313:19366:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:number, attendees  at  earlier  events, responded  by post  or email. The  questionnaire 
10:314:19452:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:asked  respondents  to  classify  a  contract  management  situation  in  terms  of  the 
10:315:19541:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction  characteristics,  the  procurement  and  contract  management  actions  taken 
10:316:19632:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the perceived outcome in terms of incidences of supplier opportunism. The nature 
10:317:19714:21:21:90:401:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the sample meant that the response rate was high, about 50%. 
10:318:19777:21:21:90:93:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
10:319:19777:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Following, for example, Anderson and Dekker (2005), supply-side perceptions of the 
10:320:19859:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transactions  were not  collected. Safeguards  against false  reporting  on  the  part  of the 
10:321:19952:21:21:90:511:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:buy-side respondents, particularly with respect to perceptions of transaction outcomes, 
10:322:20038:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:included both an  offer  of anonymity and  privacy  at  the  time  of  completing  the 
10:323:20121:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:questionnaire. This was aimed at removing any risk of an ‘audience effect’. There was 
10:324:20205:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also careful selection of the sample. The managers asked to participate in the research 
10:325:20292:21:20:90:507:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:were selected on the basis of their association with the authors’ institution (through 
10:326:20379:20:21:90:507:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attendance  at conferences,  courses, workshops,  etc.).  While  this buy-side  focused 
10:327:20466:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:convenience sampling might have limited the representativeness, of the survey it did 
10:328:20550:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mean  that  the  respondents  were academically informed  managers  with  an  interest  in 
10:329:20640:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contributing  to robust research findings within  their  vocational  area. It can  be also 
10:330:20729:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:plausibly  argued  that buy-side  managers  are  a  more  reliable  source  of  data  than 
10:331:20818:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supply-side  managers on the issue of  supplier  opportunism. Buy-side  managers  tend 
10:332:20903:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to see addressing supplier opportunism as  a standard part of their role (The Authors, 
11:333:20992:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2007),  whereas supply-side  managers  tend  to  be reluctant  to  admit  opportunism,  not 
11:334:21083:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:least as some forms of opportunism fall outside of commercial law. Finally, while the 
11:335:21168:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:respondents  were asked  to provide their  perceptions  of  the  transaction outcomes, the 
11:336:21257:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:phrasing of the questions regarding outcome were specifically designed to encourage 
11:337:21341:20:21:90:150:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:objectivity.  
11:338:21353:21:21:90:93:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:339:21353:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The aforementioned offer of  anonymity  means that the  demographic  breakdown  of 
11:340:21434:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  sample is not complete, because a proportion  of  the respondents  opted  to  omit 
11:341:21519:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some  or  all  of  the  personal  details  section of  the  questionnaire.  The  only  personal 
11:342:21614:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:detail that was insisted upon related to whether their employment was in the public or 
11:343:21701:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:private sector (104 and 76 respondents respectively). Anonymity was one element of 
11:344:21783:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the ethical approval process related to this project. Other aspects were assurances over 
11:345:21871:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the storage and use of the data, voluntary participation and an offer of privacy during 
11:346:21959:21:20:90:361:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:questionnaire completion, facilitating non-participation. 
11:347:22015:20:21:90:93:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:348:22015:21:21:90:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, on the basis of the information possessed by the researchers, the following 
11:349:22100:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:breakdown can be reported. Many purchase categories were covered: telecoms and IT 
11:350:22180:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(20.6%); commodities   and   chemicals (15.5%); miscellaneous   business   services 
11:351:22263:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(12.1%); miscellaneous   materials, e.g.   printed   materials (11.2%); professional 
11:352:22345:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:services  (11.2%); industrial  equipment  (7.2%);  and others  (21.6%). In  terms  of 
11:353:22430:21:20:90:507:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:position     in     the     organisation,     25.5% of     respondents were     procurement 
11:354:22522:20:21:90:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:executives/directors,  48.9%  were  procurement  managers and 11.2%  were  buyers  or 
11:355:22606:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:senior buyers. The remaining 12.2% were general managers involved in procurement. 
11:356:22686:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Most  of  the respondents were  from  the  UK  (73.4%).  Others came  from  Africa 
11:357:22768:20:21:90:373:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(18.1%), Europe (4.2%), and the rest of the world (4.2%).  
11:358:22825:21:21:90:93:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:359:22825:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:All  of  the  respondents  had  been  prominently  involved  in,  and  were  therefore  highly 
11:360:22920:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:knowledgeable  about, the  situation  on  which  they  reported. All  of  the  suppliers 
11:361:23007:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reported on by the respondents were private sector, for-profit organisations; no public 
11:362:23093:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:or  third  sector  suppliers  were covered.  As  mentioned,  the  research  sample  included 
11:363:23186:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:respondents from both public and private sector buying organisations. This allowed a 
11:364:23269:20:21:90:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:public sector dummy variable to be included to assess differences in procurement and 
11:365:23354:21:21:90:432:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract management practices and outcomes between the two sectors.

12:368:23462:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  selecting  both  the  independent  and  dependent  variables,  we  have  been  guided  by 
12:369:23556:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the relevant literature  (for  example,  Williamson,  1985;  Milgrom  and  Roberts,  1992; 
12:370:23647:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Klein,  1996;  Anderson  and  Dekker,  2005;  The  Author,  2005).  Given  the  breadth  of 
12:371:23739:20:21:90:507:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the coverage of the research study, however, not all aspects of the concepts arising out 
12:372:23827:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the relevant literature were covered by the questionnaire. Instead we questioned the 
12:373:23913:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:respondents about certain aspects of the concepts that can be used to qualify relevant 
12:374:23998:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction    characteristics, management control mechanisms and types    of 
12:375:24073:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism. While this was done to prevent the questionnaire from becoming overly 
12:376:24156:21:21:90:507:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long and  complex in an effort to achieve a  good  response rate, the authors recognise 
12:377:24243:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that as a result they can make no claim that the research is comprehensive in terms of 
12:378:24330:20:21:90:192:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:testing the literature.

12:383:24551:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:statistical description of each of the six independent variables considered in this study 
12:384:24641:20:21:90:418:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is provided in Table A (Panel A), which is included in Appendix A. 
12:385:24707:21:21:90:93:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:386:24707:21:21:108:244:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(i) Transaction importance 
12:387:24732:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Buying  organisations  are  potentially  vulnerable  to  supplier  opportunism  when  what 
12:388:24823:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they  are  buying  is  strategically  and/or  operationally  important.  This  is  because  they 
12:389:24920:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are likely to be in a position where they will have to make a purchase and see through 
12:390:25007:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  contractual  period. Choosing not  to  buy is  not  an  option. We  use  two indicators, 
12:391:25095:20:21:90:437:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opeimp (Q1) and strimp (Q2), to measure this transaction characteristic. 
12:392:25164:21:21:90:93:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:393:25164:21:20:108:341:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(ii) Competition and supplier bargaining power 
12:394:25208:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  the  research it was  hypothesized  that  more  powerful  suppliers,  facing  less  intense 
12:395:25303:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competitive  pressure and  dealing  with  dependent  buyers, would  be  more  prone  to 
12:396:25389:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunistic  behaviour (The  Author,  2005). Buyer-supplier  power  across  the  180 
12:397:25475:21:20:90:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract management situations was measured using the indicator market (Q4) and a 
12:398:25553:20:21:90:293:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:range of power relationships were found.  
12:399:25594:21:21:90:93:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:400:25594:21:0:90:93:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:401:25596:0:20:90:96:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
13:402:25596:20:21:108:189:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(iii) Uncertainty 
13:403:25612:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Uncertainty is  a  concept  that  has  many  manifestations (The  Author,  2012).  In  line 
13:404:25703:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  Williamson  (1985),  we focused here  on  the  ex  ante  specification  problem.  This 
13:405:25795:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:problem  can  cause  contractual  incompleteness  that,  in  turn,  creates  vulnerability  to 
13:406:25890:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism, especially in the form of hold-up (Williamson, 1985). It can also cause 
13:407:25973:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:information  asymmetry  problems  for  buyers. We used two  survey  questions  as 
13:408:26054:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicators  of  this  latent  construct  to  describe ex  ante uncertainty.  Respondents were 
13:409:26147:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:asked to report the extent to which future contingencies could be envisaged, noenvcon 
13:410:26232:21:21:90:507:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Q5), and the extent to which a common understanding of future contingencies could 
13:411:26313:21:20:90:237:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be achieved, nocomcon (Q6).  
13:412:26339:20:21:90:93:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:413:26339:21:21:108:347:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(iv)  Sunk costs (transaction-specific investments) 
13:414:26387:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Transaction-specific investments,   particularly   when   combined   with   the   type   of 
13:415:26479:20:21:90:507:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncertainty described above, create potential vulnerability to supplier opportunism in 
13:416:26564:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the form of hold-up. The term refers to investments in human, site or physical assets 
13:417:26646:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  have  little  or  no  value  outside  of a  particular transaction. Here we  used two 
13:418:26735:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:questions concerning the losses the buyer would sustain if the relationship ended, first 
13:419:26821:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in terms of investments in physical equipment, invphy (Q10), and, second, in terms of 
13:420:26902:21:21:90:281:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:investments in training, invtrain (Q11). 
13:421:26940:21:20:90:93:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:422:26940:20:21:108:197:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(v) Purchase type 
13:423:26956:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We measured  purchase  type  in  two  ways.  First  we  differentiated  between goods  and 
13:424:27047:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:services  purchases using  the indicator service,  with  goods  as  0  and  services  as  1. 
13:425:27139:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Second  we  differentiated  between types of  agreement in  terms  of  the  complexity  of 
13:426:27229:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the payment  mechanism.  This was  measured  by  the  indicator dpl (Q26),  with  fixed 
13:427:27317:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:price  agreements  as  0,  and  flexible  price  agreements  and  other  more  complicated 
13:428:27408:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:payment  mechanisms  as  1. We  were  interested  to  explore  the  argument  that  services 
13:429:27500:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purchases  involving  flexible  payment  mechanisms  might  pose hazards  of  supplier 
13:430:27587:21:21:90:507:158:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:opportunism, because  of  ‘plasticity’,  greater  scope  for  supplier  discretion,  in  the 
13:431:27680:21:20:90:338:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:delivery process (Alchian and Woodward, 1988).    
13:432:27728:20:21:90:93:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
13:433:27728:21:0:108:331:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(vi) Interdependencies with other transactions 
14:434:27775:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:We measured the extent to which performance on a contract would affect a supplier’s 
14:435:27859:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ability to  win  further  business  from  the  relevant  internal  client or the  buying 
14:436:27947:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organisation in  general.  The  extent to  which  this  is  the  case  is  a result of relative 
14:437:28040:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction   interdependency. We   used   two   indicators, perfresulta (Q36) and 
14:438:28122:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perfresultb (Q37), to  measure  the  latent  variable  of  interdependencies  with  other 
14:439:28210:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transactions. The  argument  explored  here  is  that  transactions  with  high  levels  of 
14:440:28301:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interdependency  are  less  likely  to  pose  hazards  of  supplier  opportunism than  those 
14:441:28393:20:21:90:178:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with low levels.    
14:442:28411:21:21:90:93:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:443:28411:21:21:90:192:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dependent variables 
14:444:28430:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  following  sections  describe  the  measures  and  scale-development  procedures  for 
14:445:28521:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  dependent  variables: management  control  mechanisms and  problems  of supplier 
14:446:28607:21:21:90:159:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism.  
14:447:28620:21:20:90:93:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:448:28620:20:21:108:476:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(i) Common factor analysis (CFA) of the management control mechanisms  
14:449:28688:21:21:90:507:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our questionnaire   survey gathered   evidence   about sixteen   management   control 
14:450:28772:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms  that have  been  identified  in  the  literature  as  having  the  potential  to 
14:451:28865:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:restrain supplier opportunism, i.e. mechanisms that can be placed within the cautious 
14:452:28950:21:21:90:505:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:approach  to  procurement  and  contract  management.  These relate  to the  areas  of  pre-
14:453:29042:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract  management,  procurement  actions,  reputation  effects  and  legal  action. The 
14:454:29132:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:questions  that  covered  these  mechanisms  may have been  subject  to measurement 
14:455:29214:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:errors and will also inevitably be correlated to each other. To address these risks, we 
14:456:29299:21:21:90:494:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:used common factor analysis to obtain four common factors.ii These are as follows: 
14:457:29380:21:20:90:93:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:458:29380:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Factor  1:Pre-contract   management  index: preconmanidx (higher  values =  more 
14:459:29459:21:21:90:302:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:understanding of procurement requirement) 
14:460:29500:21:20:90:482:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Factor 2:  Procurement actions index: paidx (higher values = more control effort) 
14:461:29580:20:21:90:469:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Factor 3:  Reputation effects index: repidx (higher values = more track record) 
14:462:29658:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Factor  4:    Credibility  of  legal  threat  index: ltcredidx (higher  values =  more  credible 
14:463:29754:21:21:90:150:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:legal threat) 
14:464:29767:21:20:90:93:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
14:465:29767:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  order  to  keep  the  common  factors  consistent  with  the  original  0  to  10  scales  used 
14:466:29867:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  the  separate  variables  in  the  survey,  they  were  rescaled  with  a  mean  of  5  and  a 
14:467:29967:21:0:90:213:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:standard deviation of 2.iii 
15:468:29996:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The first common factor, pre-contract management index, loads on variables relating 
15:469:30080:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to the framing of the agreement. Key questions here  concern the extent to which the 
15:470:30165:21:21:90:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:internal  client  and  the supplier have  a  clear  idea  of  the  buying  organisation’s 
15:471:30254:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement requirements.  The  indicators  used  were clearidea (Q15), procurepro 
15:472:30334:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Q16), comptension (Q17), suppliercleara (Q18), supplierclearb (Q19) and 
15:473:30401:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supmonitor (Q24). Higher  values represent  a  well-researched understanding  of  the 
15:474:30484:21:20:90:199:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purchase requirement. 
15:475:30504:20:21:90:93:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:476:30504:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The second factor, procurement actions index, loads on variables concerned with the 
15:477:30587:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time  and  effort  required  to  research,  negotiate,  design  and  draft the  contract.  The 
15:478:30682:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicators  used  were searsup (Q21), negterms (Q22) and dedrcon (Q23). Higher 
15:479:30755:20:21:90:500:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:values indicate that more resources have been devoted to these procurement actions.  
15:480:30838:21:21:90:93:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:481:30838:21:20:90:507:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  third  factor,  labelled reputation effects index, concerns  the extent  to  which  the 
15:482:30929:20:21:90:508:469:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:supplier’s reputation is known by the buyer. The indicators used were repuexpa (Q34) 
15:483:31013:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and repuexpb (Q35). Higher  values  indicate  that  the  supplier  is  well known  by both 
15:484:31099:21:20:90:299:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the buyer and the industry more generally.  
15:485:31139:20:21:90:93:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:486:31139:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  fourth  factor, credibility  of  legal  threat  index,  loads  on  items  related  to  the 
15:487:31235:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credibility  of  legal  threats to  the  supplier.  The  relevant  variables  are the chance  of 
15:488:31331:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:winning a  legal  case  (lowwin, Q49), potential damage to the  supplier relationship 
15:489:31413:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  a  prolonged  legal  dispute (reladamage, Q50), the impact  on  operational 
15:490:31493:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:performance of a prolonged legal dispute (operadamage, Q51), the financial cost of a 
15:491:31576:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:legal  dispute  (financost, Q52) and the size  of  any  potential  legal pay-out (lowpay, 
15:492:31662:20:21:90:507:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Q53). The  way  these  questions  were  asked  means  that  higher  values  suggest  a  more 
15:493:31755:21:19:90:191:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:credible legal threat. 
15:494:31776:19:19:90:92:222:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman: 
15:495:31776:19:21:90:508:203:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Descriptive  statistics  of  these  four  management  indices  are  presented  in  Table  A 
15:496:31868:21:20:90:216:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Panel B) in Appendix A. 
15:497:31892:20:21:90:93:162:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
15:498:31892:21:21:108:306:141:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(ii) Incidence of opportunistic behaviour 
15:499:31932:21:21:90:508:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Panel  C  in  Table  A contains  the  main  dependent  variables  to  measure  opportunistic 
15:500:32025:21:20:90:507:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behaviours by  suppliers.  The  variables  chosen  were  certain  restricted  aspects  of 
15:501:32114:20:0:90:505:79:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adverse  selection  (AS),  moral  hazard  (MH),  pre-contractual  hold-up  (HU1) and  post-
16:502:32206:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contractual  hold-up  (HU2). These  concepts  were discussed  earlier  in  the  article as 
16:503:32296:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hazards that a cautious approach to procurement and contract management might seek 
16:504:32379:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  address. All  variables  are measured  in  a range  from  0  to  10,  with  a  high  score 
16:505:32472:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reflecting  a  higher  level  of  opportunism.  It  is  important  to  note here that,  in 
16:506:32563:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accordance  with  the  literature, there  is  no  expectation  that  all  of  the  independent 
16:507:32657:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variables relating to transaction characteristics will cause a rise in the level of all four 
16:508:32749:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of   the selected opportunistic   behaviours. Certain   problems   of   opportunism   are 
16:509:32837:20:21:90:464:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:understood as being associated only with certain transactional characteristics. 
16:510:32915:21:21:90:93:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
16:511:32915:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We explored  only  certain restricted aspects  of  the  selected  types  of  opportunism  in 
16:512:33008:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:order to ensure that the  questionnaire survey  was not overly long or  complex. It was 
16:513:33095:20:21:90:507:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:felt  that  aspects  of  each  opportunism  type  would  together  provide  a  sample  of 
16:514:33185:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potential opportunistic actions and allow certain, if restricted, conclusions to be drawn 
16:515:33275:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:about the efficacy of management control mechanisms. In this context, the incidence 
16:516:33359:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  adverse  selection (AS) was  measured in  terms  of whether  the  product or  service 
16:517:33445:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lived up to the ex ante promises made by the supplier (Q30) and that of moral hazard 
16:518:33527:21:20:90:507:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(MH) by   asking whether,   following   the   signing   of   the   contract,   the   supplier 
16:519:33620:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consistently came up short in terms of effort (Q32). This is what Milgrom and Roberts 
16:520:33705:21:21:90:224:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1992) refer to as shirking.

16:522:33734:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Two hold-up variables (HU1 and HU2) were also explored. HU1 was measured by a 
16:523:33810:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:question  asking whether, between  winning  the  competitive  tender and  signing  the 
16:524:33895:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract, the supplier attempted to revise and renegotiate the terms of the deal (Q31) – 
16:525:33980:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a situation known as pre-contractual drift (The Authors, 2007). Evidence of HU2 was 
16:526:34062:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:gleaned  by   asking whether following start  of  the contract period the  supplier 
16:527:34143:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attempted to revise and renegotiate the terms or take advantage of contract variations 
16:528:34229:21:21:90:490:220:12:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:(Q33), familiar situations relating to post-contractual hold-up (Williamson, 1985).

16:534:34432:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 1 reports the findings of our test of hypothesis 1. This hypothesis concerns the 
16:535:34519:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship between transaction characteristics and management control mechanisms. 
17:536:34605:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The findings show that transactions  characterised by the selected ex ante uncertainty 
17:537:34691:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:attribute are   significantly   associated   with   less   extensive   management   control, 
17:538:34784:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:especially  pre-contract  management  (-0.6)  and  reputation  effects  (-0.53). Our  results 
17:539:34878:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also  show negative,  although  not  statistically  significant,  associations  between the 
17:540:34969:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:selected uncertainty attribute and both procurement actions (-1.23) and the credibility 
17:541:35051:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  legal  threats  (-0.14). We  also  find significant  negative  associations  between the 
17:542:35142:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sunk costs incurred by the buying organisation and the extent of management control 
17:543:35226:20:21:90:456:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through pre-contract management (-0.69) and credible legal threats (-0.53).

17:573:36166:21:20:90:508:160:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Taking together the findings in relation to both the selected uncertainty  attribute and 
17:574:36255:20:21:90:508:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sunk costs, we can say there is indeed evidence that certain transaction characteristics 
17:575:36344:21:21:90:507:119:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:place a strain on the ‘feasible foresight’ of managers (Williamson, 1996). This reflects 
17:576:36430:21:20:90:392:98:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expectations in the literature (for example, Williamson, 1985). 
17:577:36492:20:0:90:93:78:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:578:36494:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Our data also shows a significant negative association between the level of transaction 
18:579:36580:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interdependencies and knowledge of the supplier’s reputation (-0.98). This shows that 
18:580:36665:21:21:90:508:717:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:when a supplier’s ability to win future business is dependent on its performance in 
18:581:36749:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current  contracts, buyers  are less concerned with examining the supplier’s historical 
18:582:36836:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:track record. By contrast, purchase type is positively associated with knowledge of the 
18:583:36923:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supplier’s reputation (0.41). Service purchases with flexible payment mechanisms are 
18:584:37007:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shown  to  be  associated  with  greater  consideration  of supplier reputation  than  is  the 
18:585:37102:20:21:90:374:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:case for goods purchases with fixed payment mechanisms. 
18:586:37156:21:21:90:93:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:587:37156:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, we note that, while the findings show no significant associations between the 
18:588:37243:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:use of management control mechanisms and transaction importance, competition and 
18:589:37324:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market  power,  and  the  public  dummy variable,  the  whole  structural  equation  model 
18:590:37415:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exhibits a good fit (Fan et al., 1999; Hu and Bentler; 1999). This applies across a wide 
18:591:37501:21:20:90:411:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:range of fit statistics, including but not limited to those reported.iv  
18:592:37571:20:21:90:93:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
18:593:37571:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In terms of hypothesis 1, therefore, we can conclude that evidence exists that certain 
18:594:37656:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transactional characteristics reduce the extensiveness of   management   control 
18:595:37734:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms. Some  contributors  to the  literature  (for  example,  Williamson,  1985) 
18:596:37820:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:argue that this will increase buyer vulnerability to supplier opportunism. Also, efforts 
18:597:37907:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to establish the reputational track record of suppliers are shown to be lower when the 
18:598:37993:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction  is  interdependent  with  others  made  by  the  buying  organisation.  What  we 
18:599:38087:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:see  here  is  that  this  transaction  characteristic  contains  its  own  protection  against 
18:600:38183:21:21:90:156:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism.

18:604:38299:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 2 reports  the  findings  from  our  test  of both hypothesis  2  (Panel  B)  and 
18:605:38384:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hypothesis   3   (Panels   C   and D). Hypothesis   2   proposes   that   increases   in   the 
18:606:38479:21:21:90:507:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensiveness of management control mechanisms will reduce incidences  of supplier 
18:607:38561:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism,   while hypothesis   3   proposes   that   more   hazardous   transaction 
18:608:38648:21:20:90:507:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics will lead to increased incidences of supplier opportunism, but that this 
18:609:38737:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outcome  will  be  impacted  by  the extensiveness  of management  control  mechanisms.

20:704:41377:20:21:90:508:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The results presented in Table 2 (Panel A) are in many respects consistent with what 
20:705:41462:21:21:90:508:103:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we  find  in  the  single  equation  model  reported  in  Table  1,  but  they  produce  more 
20:706:41556:21:0:90:508:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:efficient  estimations  for  our  coefficients.  Hence,  we  find  that the conclusions drawn 
21:707:41650:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:above regarding  relationships between  transaction  characteristics  and management 
21:708:41734:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:control  mechanisms (hypothesis  1) have  become more  broadly  and  prominently 
21:709:41813:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supported. As  in  Table  1,  our  results  show  that  transactions  characterised  by the 
21:710:41903:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:selected ex  ante uncertainty attribute are  significantly  associated  with  less  extensive 
21:711:41993:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management  control  through  pre-contract  management  (-0.59)  and  reputation  effects 
21:712:42083:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(-0.51).  We  also  again  find  a  negative  association  between this  aspect  of uncertainty 
21:713:42179:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and procurement actions, but this has now become statistically significant (-0.92). As 
21:714:42265:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:before,  more  investment  in  sunk  cost has  a  negative association with pre-contract 
21:715:42352:21:21:90:368:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management (-0.7) and credibility of legal threat (-0.54).

21:717:42408:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We also find   the   same significant   negative   association   between   the   level of 
21:718:42496:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:transaction  interdependencies  and knowledge  of the  supplier’s reputational  track 
21:719:42581:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:record (-0.98),  but  this  time  we  also  see  significant  evidence  of  less  extensive 
21:720:42671:21:20:90:371:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement actions (-0.9) as interdependencies increase.

21:722:42728:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Purchase  type is  once  again  positively  associated  with  management  control  through 
21:723:42818:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reputation   effects   (0.41).   We   also   now   see   evidence   of   a   significant   positive 
21:724:42918:20:21:90:505:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:association between purchase type and the effort put into procurement actions (2.72).

21:726:43003:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  before,  we  find  no  evidence  of  significant  associations  between  the  use  of 
21:727:43093:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management control mechanisms and transaction importance, competition and market 
21:728:43174:20:21:90:284:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power, and the public dummy variable.

21:730:43211:21:20:90:166:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Panel B results 
21:731:43226:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Panel B presents the results of our test of hypothesis 2, which proposes that increases 
21:732:43314:21:21:90:507:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  the  extensiveness of  management  control  mechanisms  will  reduce  incidences  of 
21:733:43402:21:20:90:447:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supplier opportunism. Our data provide some support for this hypothesis.  
21:734:43473:20:21:90:93:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
21:735:43473:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the  case of  pre-contract  management,  we  find a  significant association.  More 
21:736:43557:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensive pre-contract management is significantly associated with fewer problems of 
21:737:43641:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the selected aspect of adverse selection (AS, -0.13), pre-contract hold-up (HU1, -0.22) 
21:738:43729:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and post-contract  hold-up  (HU2, -0.15).  Our findings show an association between 
21:739:43809:21:21:90:507:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:knowledge  of  supplier  reputation  and all  four  opportunistic  behaviours:  the  selected 
21:740:43902:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aspect of adverse selection (AS, -0.3), the selected aspect of moral hazard (MH, -0.4), 
22:741:43992:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pre-contractual  hold-up  (HU1, -0.3)  and post-contractual  hold-up  (HU2, -0.36). 
22:742:44076:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, we find that  a credible legal threat is significantly associated with a reduced 
22:743:44166:21:21:90:507:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incidence  of  two  of  the  four  supplier  opportunism problems, the  selected  aspect  of 
22:744:44258:21:20:90:508:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adverse  selection  (AS, -0.12)  and post-contractual  hold-up  (HU2, -0.15). The  results 
22:745:44349:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  the  procurement  actions index have  big  values  and  show that more  control  effort 
22:746:44440:21:21:90:409:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:led to lower opportunism, but they are not statistically significant.

22:749:44529:21:21:90:507:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The results  of  our  test  of  hypothesis  3  are  presented  in  Panels  C  and  D.  This 
22:750:44621:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hypothesis concerns  the  relationship  between  transaction  characteristics  and  supplier 
22:751:44714:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:opportunism,   both   without   the   intervening   variable   of   management   control 
22:752:44803:20:21:90:511:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms (the structural form) and with the intervening variable (the reduced form). 
22:753:44890:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  test  the  argument  that  more  hazardous  transaction  characteristics  will  lead  to 
22:754:44983:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increased incidences of supplier opportunism, but that this outcome will be influenced 
22:755:45070:20:21:90:371:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by the extensiveness of management control mechanisms. 
22:756:45123:21:21:90:93:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
22:757:45123:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the structural form (Panel C), our findings are broadly supportive of the argument 
22:758:45209:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that increased transactional hazards will lead to increased incidences of opportunism, 
22:759:45296:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:but   none   of   the   results   are   statistically   significant. The   effects   of   transaction 
22:760:45398:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics  on  opportunism  become  much  more  significant when  we  look  at  the 
22:761:45488:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reduced form of our model (Panel D). This complements the data on hypothesis 2 in 
22:762:45570:20:21:90:507:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  it  provides  further  evidence that  the extensiveness  of management  control 
22:763:45654:21:21:90:355:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms has an important impact on opportunism.  
22:764:45704:21:20:90:93:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
22:765:45704:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In terms of the details of this, we found that our  selected types of opportunism are a 
22:766:45790:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:particular  problem  for buying  organisations  when transactions are  characterised  by 
22:767:45878:21:20:90:507:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our selected ex ante uncertainty attribute and significant sunk costs. The results show 
22:768:45961:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  significant  positive  association  between the  selected uncertainty attribute and both 
22:769:46049:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  selected  aspect  of adverse  selection  (AS, 0.63) and the  selected  aspect  of moral 
22:770:46140:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hazard (MH, 0.66). A high level of sunk cost investment, meanwhile, is significantly 
22:771:46223:21:20:90:448:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:positively associated with the selected aspect of moral hazard (MH, 0.55). 
22:772:46297:20:21:90:93:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
22:773:46297:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Beyond this, purchase type being a service with a flexible payment mechanism rather 
22:774:46381:21:0:90:505:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than  a  good with  a  fixed  payment  mechanism increases  the  incidence  of  post-
23:775:46466:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contractual  hold-up (HU2, 1.04),  while  there  is a  significant  negative  association 
23:776:46554:20:21:90:505:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between   the   level   of   transaction   interdependencies   and   the   incidence   of   post-
23:777:46651:21:21:90:258:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contractual hold-up (HU2, -0.53).  
23:778:46685:21:20:90:93:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
23:779:46685:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally,  although  we  find no  significant association  between  any  of  the  four chosen 
23:780:46777:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:types of  supplier  opportunism  and  transaction  importance, competition  and  market 
23:781:46864:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power, and the  public  dummy variable,  the  whole  structural  equation  model does 
23:782:46949:20:21:90:350:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exhibit a good fit across a wide range of fit statistics.v

23:785:47006:21:20:90:150:551:12:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:Conclusion 
23:786:47016:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  this  article,  we  have  provided  a  data set concerning the procurement  and  contract 
23:787:47108:21:21:90:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:management experiences of a sample of  buying  organisations.  Using  data  from  180 
23:788:47192:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement and contract management situations, 104 of them in the public sector, we 
23:789:47277:20:21:90:508:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have  tested  three  hypotheses  derived  from  the literature. We have also  assessed 
23:790:47360:21:21:90:508:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whether  there were significant  differences  between  public  sector  and  private  sector 
23:791:47450:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experience. The evidence, although at times inconclusive, provided some support for 
23:792:47530:20:21:90:508:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  view that certain  procurement  and  contract  management mechanisms can  assist 
23:793:47616:21:21:90:507:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:buying organisations   in moderating opportunism,   but   that   certain   transaction 
23:794:47702:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics  make  the  use  of  certain  management  mechanisms  difficult.  The 
23:795:47788:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evidence   found   no   significant   differences   between   public   and   private   sector 
23:796:47882:20:21:90:458:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:experiences in any part of the study. We summarize our key findings below. 
23:797:47955:21:21:90:93:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
23:798:47955:21:20:90:507:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:First,  we  found  that  transactions  characterized  by  a  greater  degree  of  hazard, in 
23:799:48048:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:particular,  the  selected ex  ante uncertainty attribute  and sunk  costs,  tended  to  be 
23:800:48136:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:associated with less extensive management control mechanisms. This was in line with 
23:801:48218:21:20:90:508:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  expectation  of  the  literature  (for  example, Williamson,  1985  and  1996). Second, 
23:802:48311:20:21:90:508:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our    evidence    showed    that    increased extensiveness of    management    control 
23:803:48399:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mechanisms tended to reduce incidences of supplier opportunism. Efforts to establish 
23:804:48484:21:21:90:507:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supplier  track  record  and reputation  had  the  broadest  impact,  with  the  evidence 
23:805:48574:21:20:90:505:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:showing  a  significant  negative  association  across  all  four  types  of  opportunism.  Pre-
23:806:48670:20:21:90:507:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract  management  and  credible  legal  threats also had  a  significant  impact  in 
23:807:48759:21:0:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reducing the selected aspect of adverse selection and hold-up. There is some evidence, 
24:808:48845:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:therefore, that  supplier  opportunism can  be  addressed  through elements  of what  we 
24:809:48932:20:21:90:248:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have called a cautious approach. 
24:810:48963:21:21:90:93:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
24:811:48963:21:20:90:507:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Third,  we found  that  transactions  characterized  by  a  greater  degree  of  hazard,  in 
24:812:49056:20:21:90:508:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:particular the  selected ex  ante uncertainty attribute  and sunk  costs, were  associated 
24:813:49143:21:21:90:507:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with  a  greater  incidence  of  supplier  opportunism. The  selected  aspects  of  adverse 
24:814:49235:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:selection  and  moral  hazard  were  the  most  prominent  problems.  These  positive 
24:815:49321:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:associations  were  only  statistically  significant,  however,  when  modelled  with  the 
24:816:49412:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:intervening variable of management control mechanisms. This again suggests that the 
24:817:49496:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:degree  to  which  supplier  opportunism  is  a  problem can  be influenced  by the 
24:818:49579:21:20:90:341:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensiveness of management control mechanisms.  
24:819:49625:20:21:90:93:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
24:820:49625:21:21:90:508:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Given  these  findings,  there  is  some merit in  considering  in  more  detail  what  a 
24:821:49714:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cautious approach to procurement and contract management might entail. There are a 
24:822:49794:20:21:90:413:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:number of main elements that arise specifically from this research: 
24:823:49859:21:22:90:93:448:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
24:824:49859:22:20:108:508:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Time and effort in ensuring, particularly in the case of significant procurement 
24:825:49940:20:21:126:508:406:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exercises, that, in  so  far  as  uncertainty  allows,  there  is  clarity  over purchase 
24:826:50030:21:21:126:508:385:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:requirements  and  that  those  requirements  are  communicated  effectively  to 
24:827:50111:21:20:126:508:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suppliers. Opportunistic suppliers will seek to take advantage of both a lack of 
24:828:50192:20:21:126:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:clarity (and any consequent contractual incompleteness) and frequent changes 
24:829:50268:21:22:126:265:323:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to the purchase requirement. 
24:830:50296:22:20:108:508:301:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Time and effort in researching the attributes of the supplier so as to address the 
24:831:50379:20:21:126:508:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possibility of adverse selection. It is common for suppliers to exaggerate their 
24:832:50460:21:22:126:186:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capabilities. 
24:833:50473:22:21:108:475:238:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Enquiries into a supplier’s reputation and track record prior to selection. 
24:834:50549:21:21:108:507:217:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Time  and effort,  particularly  in  the  case  of  those  procurement  exercises  that 
24:835:50638:21:21:126:508:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pose  a  risk  of  supplier opportunism,  to  carefully  draw  up  a  contract  that  will 
24:836:50728:21:20:126:508:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:protect  against  potential  opportunism. In  terms  of  addressing  hold-up, the 
24:837:50809:20:21:126:508:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract might contain balancing provisions, for example, liquidated damages 
24:838:50885:21:21:126:508:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and property rights  allocation (Williamson, 1985; Grossman  and  Hart, 1986). 
24:839:50962:21:20:126:508:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  terms  of  addressing  moral  hazard,  the  contract  might  contain performance 
24:840:51047:20:0:126:180:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incentives. 
25:841:51060:0:21:108:508:758:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f8: A common feature of procurement practice is the tendency to ‘let and forget’. 
25:842:51139:21:21:126:508:737:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A  cautious  approach  warns  against  this  and  includes effective  monitoring  to 
25:843:51223:21:21:126:508:716:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:address   potential moral   hazard.   This   runs   in   combination   with   the 
25:844:51305:21:20:126:507:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aforementioned incentive provisions within the  contract (Baron and  Besanko, 
25:845:51383:20:22:126:159:675:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1987). 
25:846:51389:22:20:108:508:653:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Active promotion of contingent renewal. Contingent renewal refers to a buyer 
25:847:51467:20:21:126:508:633:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:communicating to  a  supplier  that  its  likelihood  of  winning  future  contracts  is 
25:848:51556:21:21:126:508:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dependent  upon  its  current  performance and behaviour (Bowles  and  Gintis, 
25:849:51633:21:21:126:162:591:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1999).  
25:850:51640:21:21:108:508:570:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Signalling  to the  supplier  the  hazards  that arise from wider  reputational 
25:851:51720:21:22:126:172:549:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:damage.  
25:852:51728:22:20:108:507:527:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman: Finally, the  retention  of a credible legal  threat.  Clearly,  court  action  is  a  last 
25:853:51818:20:21:126:508:507:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resort  because  of  its  costs  and  uncertainties.  However,  highlighting   the 
25:854:51900:21:21:126:508:486:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:‘shadow  of  the  courts’ can  provide  an  effect  without  actual  legal  action 
25:855:51981:21:20:126:210:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Messick, 2005). 
25:856:51997:20:21:90:93:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
25:857:51997:21:21:90:508:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  are  two  other important features  of a  cautious  approach,  although  these were 
25:858:52087:21:21:90:508:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not  part  of  the  research  study  reported  here.  First, such  an  approach  includes an 
25:859:52178:21:20:90:508:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:extensive internal focus (The Authors, 2005). Where opportunism is feared, the need 
25:860:52260:20:21:90:508:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is heightened  for buying organisations to agree a ‘protocol’ for both cross-functional 
25:861:52347:21:21:90:507:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:internal discussions  and interactions  with  the supplier, i.e. which  personnel  are 
25:862:52430:21:20:90:508:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:permitted to communicate with the supplier and in what ways (Hughes and Dickson, 
25:863:52510:20:21:90:508:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2009). The public sector has been identified as being weak in this area of practice (for 
25:864:52598:21:21:90:508:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:example, National Audit Office, 2011). Second, this approach does not prohibit close 
25:865:52680:21:21:90:508:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:collaboration with suppliers, but suggests that it should be undertaken with safeguards 
25:866:52766:21:20:90:189:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Williamson, 1985). 
25:867:52785:20:21:90:93:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
25:868:52785:21:21:90:508:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  terms  of  the broader implications  of our findings,  these  can  be  identified  for both 
25:869:52879:21:20:90:508:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:public  policy-makers and academics.  For policy-makers,  this  research  provides a 
25:870:52961:20:21:90:508:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reminder that  supplier  behaviour is  highly  variable  and  that  the  price  of  poor 
25:871:53049:21:21:90:508:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:judgement is potentially high. Promises of integrity are not always sincere. The study 
25:872:53134:21:20:90:505:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is also a reminder to take with a pinch of salt those clichés, so often heard at policy-
25:873:53222:20:0:90:508:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:related conferences  and  seminars,  which  contend  that  success  in  procurement  and 
26:874:53313:0:20:90:508:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contract management is about trusting relationships and not about contracts. Business 
26:875:53399:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:markets  are  more  challenging  and  complicated  than  that  and  a cautious  approach  to 
26:876:53490:21:21:90:508:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  and  contract  management can,  according  to  this  study, help  buying 
26:877:53575:21:20:90:394:696:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organisations to cope with these challenges and complications.

26:879:53637:21:21:90:508:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For the academic literature, this article adds further weight to the view that, while the 
26:880:53726:21:20:90:508:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concept of supplier opportunism is an uncomfortable and regrettable one, it is not one 
26:881:53813:20:21:90:508:614:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  can  be  ignored  by  those  interested  in  procurement  and  contract  management, 
26:882:53904:21:21:90:508:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:including   that   undertaken   within   the   public   sector. Furthermore,   the evidence 
26:883:53996:21:21:90:508:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:presented  here  suggests  that  supplier  opportunism  is  most  likely  to  be  a  problem  in 
26:884:54093:21:20:90:508:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:just  the  kind  of  complex,  uncertain  and  involved  contractual  situations  into  which 
26:885:54187:20:21:90:508:531:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governments   are   increasingly   entering,   for   example   complex   PPP   and   PFI 
26:886:54275:21:21:90:507:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:arrangements (The Authors, 2007).. Public management academics have an important 
26:887:54356:21:20:90:508:489:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:role  to  play  in highlighting  the  challenges such  complex  procurements  generate  and 
26:888:54447:20:21:90:386:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the mechanisms that can be used to manage these challenges.

26:890:54506:21:20:90:508:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally, we need  to acknowledge the  limitations  of  this research study and  suggest 
26:891:54591:20:21:90:507:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:avenues  for  future  research.  First, in  order to  make  our  data  gathering  exercise 
26:892:54682:21:21:90:508:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:manageable, we considered a relatively restricted set of variables representing only a 
26:893:54769:21:21:90:508:365:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:portion of  the  concepts  suggested  as  significant  by  the  literature. Future  research 
26:894:54862:21:20:90:508:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could look at additional  dimensions of the chosen transaction characteristics, ex post 
26:895:54949:20:21:90:508:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncertainty for example, and at the impact of other characteristics such as transaction 
26:896:55037:21:21:90:508:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:size and frequency. Other dimensions of supplier opportunism, for example strategic 
26:897:55120:21:20:90:508:282:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:misrepresentation  and  quality  shading,  could  also  be  considered.  Second, while we 
26:898:55209:20:21:90:508:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:were  careful  to  ensure  that  the  data  gathered  from  our  sample  of  buyers  was  robust 
26:899:55306:21:21:90:508:241:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and reliable, future research could usefully introduce triangulation with other sources 
26:900:55394:21:20:90:507:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of evidence on supplier behaviour and performance, both primary (for example from 
26:901:55476:20:21:90:507:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:other  actors  in the buying  organisations)  and  secondary (i.e.  supplier  performance 
26:902:55565:21:21:90:508:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:data). Third,  our  survey  reports  only  on  transactions  involving  private  sector,  for- 
26:903:55658:21:21:90:508:158:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:profit suppliers. Future research could consider transactions involving public and third 
26:904:55747:21:20:90:508:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector,  not-for-profit  suppliers to  see  if  similar  associations  to  those  observed  in  this 
26:905:55847:20:21:90:508:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:study  are  in  evidence. This  would  be  an  important  extension  to  our  research  given 
26:906:55941:21:21:90:508:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recent contributions to the public sector management literature which suggest that the 
26:907:56028:21:0:90:508:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:procurement  of  services  from  the  third  sector  should  be  less  formal  and  contractual, 
27:908:56127:0:20:90:507:758:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that is perhaps more trusting and less like the cautious approach outlined here, to take 
27:909:56216:20:21:90:508:738:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:account  of  the  distinctive  social  relations  and  practices  of  voluntary  organisations

36:1208:77884:8:15:72:520:240:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:i SEM allows us to explicitly model the measurement error of our latent variables. Additionally, it permits us to 
36:1209:77997:15:12:72:516:225:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:simultaneously estimate the relationships between transaction characteristics and the four management control 
36:1210:78107:12:12:72:516:213:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:mechanisms, while explicitly modelling co-variation amongst them. Modelling interdependencies amongst the 
36:1211:78213:12:11:72:518:201:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:management control mechanisms is particularly important in light of theories that assume such control systems 
36:1212:78323:11:12:72:502:190:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:are jointly determined. Since our data are on ordinal scales and may not be normally distributed, maximum 
36:1213:78429:12:11:72:495:178:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:likelihood methods should perform well (Boomsma and Hoogland, 2001; Distefano, 2002; Anderson and 
36:1214:78527:11:8:72:134:167:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Dekker, 2005). 
36:1215:78541:8:17:72:491:159:8:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:ii In the questionnaire survey, there are 16 questions relating to management control mechanisms. These 
36:1216:78644:17:12:72:520:142:10:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f8:questions may have measurement errors and also are correlated to each other. We calculated the Kaiser–Meyer–
36:1217:78752:12:11:72:522:130:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Olkin (KMO) measures of all 16 variables (Kaiser, 1974). All KMO measures are more than 0.5 and the overall 
36:1218:78857:11:12:72:502:119:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:KMO is more than 0.65, so we can conclude that the variables have enough common factors to warrant the 
36:1219:78960:12:11:72:500:107:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:sampling adequacy to use a factor model. Hence, we applied a common factor analysis (CFA) method that 
36:1220:79062:11:12:72:513:96:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:allows for measurement error. We used the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and an oblique rotation that 
36:1221:79165:12:0:72:490:84:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:allows constructs of interest to correlate with each other. According to Fabrigar et al. (1999) at least 3-5 
37:1222:79276:0:12:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:                                                                                                                                                        
37:1223:79427:12:12:72:511:747:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:measured variables representing each common factor should be included, and a sample size of 5-10 times the 
37:1224:79533:12:11:72:517:735:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:number of measured variables is required for accurate results from the CFA method. Our sample size was 180, 
37:1225:79641:11:12:72:515:724:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:so the possible number of measured variables for factor analysis should be limited below 36 (=180/5), and the 
37:1226:79751:12:11:72:517:712:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:number of possible common factors should be below 12 (=36/3). We used a formal ML method to allow a vast 
37:1227:79856:11:12:72:503:701:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:array of goodness-of-fit information. The standard model information criteria, Akaike information criterion 
37:1228:79964:12:11:72:516:689:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(AIC) (Akaike, 1987) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978), have been used to determine 
37:1229:80068:11:12:72:520:678:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the appropriate number of factors. Both AIC and BIC indicate that 4 common factors are the best choice for the 
37:1230:80176:12:11:72:515:666:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:16 measured variables. Next, using maximum likelihood estimation and an oblique rotation, we extracted four 
37:1231:80283:11:12:72:490:655:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:factors with eigenvalues greater than one. The factor analysis yields a well-behaved solution, with items 
37:1232:80389:12:11:72:493:643:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:typically loading on a single factor, loading greater than 0.30 and few significant cross loadings. Scoring 
37:1233:80496:11:12:72:518:632:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:coefficients from the regression method inform us that the factor is obtained as a weighted sum of standardized 
37:1234:80607:12:11:72:522:620:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:versions of the 16 variables. Each estimated factor variable has been dominated by a domain of variables, which 
37:1235:80719:11:7:72:275:609:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:mainly reflects the latent variable in this domain.   
37:1236:80772:7:16:72:524:602:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:iii Our choice to rescale the common factors with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2 was made to keep the 
37:1237:80884:16:12:72:482:586:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:factors similar to the original, underlying variables, measured on a 0-10 scale, and thereby to facilitate 
37:1238:80991:12:7:72:232:574:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:convenient interpretation of our results. 
37:1239:81032:7:16:72:484:567:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:iv Good fit is indicated by a Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of less than 0.07, a 
37:1240:81131:16:11:72:500:551:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) of less than 0.05, and the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), 
37:1241:81233:11:12:72:523:540:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) being 
37:1242:81338:12:7:72:156:528:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:above or around 0.9. 
37:1243:81358:7:16:72:517:521:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:v Good fit is indicated by a RMSEA of less than 0.06, a SRMR of less than 0.05, and the GFI, AGFI NNFI and 
37:1244:81464:16:0:72:199:505:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:CFI being above or around 0.9.
