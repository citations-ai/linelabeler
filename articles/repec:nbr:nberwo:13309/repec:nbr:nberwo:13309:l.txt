2:41:2599:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Social identities prescribe behaviors for people. We identify the marginal behavioral effect of these
2:42:2700:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:norms on discount rates and risk aversion by measuring how laboratory subjects’ choices change when
2:43:2799:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:an aspect of social identity is made salient. When we make ethnic identity salient to Asian-American
2:44:2899:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:subjects, they make more patient choices. When we make racial identity salient to black subjects, non-immigrant
2:45:3010:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:blacks (but not immigrant blacks) make more patient choices. Making gender identity salient has no
2:46:3108:14:42:72:258:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:effect on intertemporal or risk choices.

3:66:3485:0:27:107:532:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Relative to white Americans, Asian-Americans accumulate more human capital and are 
3:67:3568:27:28:71:521:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more likely to participate in tax-deferred savings accounts. Black Americans accumulate less 
3:68:3661:28:27:71:537:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:financial wealth, accumulate less human capital, and are less likely to invest in the stock market, 
3:69:3761:27:28:71:533:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:even after controlling for observable demographic variables. However, recent black immigrants 
3:70:3855:28:28:71:529:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from the West Indies and Africa are disproportionately represented among high-income blacks 
3:71:3947:28:27:71:518:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and elite college students. Women invest in more conservative financial assets than men and 
3:72:4039:27:28:71:322:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:behave more cautiously in laboratory experiments.1 
3:73:4089:28:27:107:535:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Many social scientists have argued that differences in norms tied to social identities help 
3:74:4181:27:28:72:508:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:explain such demographic differences in economic outcomes.2 Asian-American identity is 
3:75:4268:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesized to include a norm for patience, non-immigrant black identity is hypothesized to 
3:76:4361:28:27:72:528:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:include norms for impatience and risk-averse investing, and a higher degree of risk aversion is 
3:77:4457:27:28:72:531:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesized to be normative for female identity than for male identity. However, it is difficult 
3:78:4555:28:27:72:501:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to test with non-experimental data whether identity norms play a causal role in economic 
3:79:4644:27:28:72:539:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:decision-making. Social category affiliations in the field are confounded with many other factors 
3:80:4742:28:27:72:514:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:such as socioeconomic status, opportunity sets, and peer pressure (David Austen-Smith and

3:92:5884:11:12:71:545:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:by  their  data  quality.  Carroll,  Rhee,  and  Rhee  (1994)  do  find  that  Asian-Canadian  immigrants’  educational  
3:93:6005:12:7:71:270:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:expenditures are 3.6 times the Canadian average. 
3:94:6054:7:16:72:543:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:2  See,  for  example,  Thomas  Sowell  (1975,  1981,  2005),  Barry  R.  Chiswick  (1983),  Charles  Murray  (1984),  Geert

4:98:6431:27:28:71:536:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:temporarily make a certain social category more salient, causing a person’s behavior to tilt more 
4:99:6529:28:27:71:530:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:toward the norms associated with the salient category. If the self-categorization theory is valid, 
4:100:6628:27:28:71:470:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:then a researcher can identify the marginal effect of a particular social category by 
4:101:6714:28:28:71:517:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:experimentally varying the salience of the category and seeing how an individual’s behavior 
4:102:6806:28:27:71:116:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:changes. 
4:103:6815:27:28:107:527:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Our focus is on the effect of ethnic, racial, and gender category norms on time and risk 
4:104:6904:28:27:71:520:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:preferences. After randomly manipulating category salience, we elicit subjects’ time and risk 
4:105:6998:27:28:71:504:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:preferences using incentive-compatible mechanisms standard in experimental economics. 
4:106:7084:28:28:71:526:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Section I describes a theoretical framework for understanding how priming effects allow us to 
4:107:7178:28:27:71:218:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:make inferences about norms. 
4:108:7207:27:28:107:537:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Section II presents the first experiment, which studies the effect of Asian ethnic category 
4:109:7299:28:27:71:525:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:norms on time and risk preferences. Consistent with the hypothesis that Asian category norms 
4:110:7392:27:28:71:525:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:help explain high Asian-American capital accumulation, we find that primed Asian-American 
4:111:7482:28:27:71:432:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subjects make more patient choices than Asian-American control subjects. 
4:112:7555:27:28:107:523:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Section III presents the second experiment, which studies black racial category norms 
4:113:7641:28:28:71:541:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and gender category norms. Contrary to the arguments of Sowell (1975, 1981, 2005) and Charles 
4:114:7735:28:27:71:527:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Murray (1984), we find that making race salient causes native blacks—that is, those who have 
4:115:7828:27:28:71:542:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:long-standing U.S. roots—to become more patient, whereas it has no effect on immigrant blacks’ 
4:116:7923:28:27:71:521:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:discount rates.3 We also find suggestive evidence that native blacks become more risk averse 
4:117:8016:27:60:71:514:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when primed with race, which is consistent with racial risk norms depressing native blacks’

5:124:8585:27:28:72:496:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:past research in two important ways. First, we focus on primitive preference parameters 
5:125:8673:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:measured with incentive-compatible mechanisms, dependent variables that are primarily of 
5:126:8762:28:27:72:504:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest to economists. Second, psychologists have emphasized testing the validity of self-
5:127:8853:27:28:72:529:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:categorization theory and the cognitive mechanisms through which it operates. Therefore, they 
5:128:8947:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prime identities chosen specifically because their norms are known so that the theory has a clear 
5:129:9045:27:28:72:507:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prediction about the priming effect. We take self-categorization theory as given and prime 
5:130:9136:28:28:72:513:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:identities with unknown norms so that we can infer what those norms are via the behavioral 
5:131:9227:28:27:72:181:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:response to the prime.

5:135:9359:28:27:108:517:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Within our theoretical framework, which is inspired by Akerlof and Kranton (2000), 
5:136:9442:27:28:72:514:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:priming a particular social category reveals the marginal effect of increasing the strength of 
5:137:9537:28:28:72:493:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:affiliation with that category. Let x be some action choice, such as how much to pursue 
5:138:9625:28:27:72:529:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:immediate gratification or how much to avoid risks. An individual belongs to a social category 
5:139:9720:27:69:72:502:212:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:C, such as black race or female gender, with strength s ≥ 0. Let x0 denote the individual’s 
5:140:9811:69:7:216:219:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:                                                 
5:141:9859:7:16:72:542:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:4 Identity salience studies include Stephen Reicher and Mark Levine (1994), Mark R. Forehand, Rohit Deshpandé,

5:143:10093:12:11:71:542:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:priming techniques are widely used in psychology to explore broader cognitive processes. See, for example, John A.

5:145:10317:12:11:71:542:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:Times:F:economic  research  on  social  identity  and  discrimination  against  outgroup  members  (e.g.,  Karla  Hoff  and  Priyanka 
5:146:10442:11:0:71:274:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Pandey 2006; Yan Chen and Sherry Xin Li 2009).

6:148:10590:27:30:72:423:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for members of social category C. The individual chooses x to maximize 
6:149:10661:30:31:319:661:651:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?: 220(1(  ))()(  )()CUwsxxwsxx=− −−   −−,                                        (1)                                        
6:150:10783:31:27:72:543:620:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where 0 ≤ w(s) ≤ 1 is the weight placed on social category C in the person’s decision. We assume 
6:151:10879:27:28:71:538:593:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that w(0) = 0 and w′ > 0. Deviating from the norm prescribed for one’s category causes disutility 
6:152:10977:28:27:72:537:565:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that is increasing in s, the strength of one’s affiliation with that category. We assume that s has a 
6:153:11079:27:28:72:501:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:steady-state value s (perhaps negatively correlated with |x0 – xC|) but can be temporarily 
6:154:11170:28:30:72:316:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:perturbed away from s by a category prime ε > 0. 
6:155:11219:30:31:108:525:480:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The first-order condition of (1) gives the optimal action, *0()  (1())()  ,Cxswsxwsx=−+ 
6:156:11306:31:28:71:510:449:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:which is a weighted average of the preferred action without identity considerations and the 
6:157:11398:28:29:71:468:421:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:category norm. This condition yields several implications that guide our analysis.  
6:158:11482:29:30:107:535:392:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: First, the higher the steady-state strength s of the category affiliation, the closer *x is to 
6:159:11577:30:29:72:532:362:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:xC. Second, a category prime ε  also causes *x to move closer to xC. Thus, the behavioral effect 
6:160:11674:29:28:72:539:333:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of priming social category C reveals the marginal behavioral effect of increasing the steady-state 
6:161:11773:28:27:71:517:305:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:strength s of C. This is why priming manipulations are a useful experimental procedure for 
6:162:11864:27:30:71:528:278:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:studying how identity affects steady-state preferences. Third, the sign of the priming treatment 
6:163:11961:30:32:71:529:248:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect, ***0()()(/)  ()(    )Cxsxsdxdswsxxεεε′+−  ≈=−, depends on the sign of 0Cxx−. Even if 
6:164:12054:32:32:72:525:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the s, 0x, and w(·) of an experimental sample differ from those of the general population, the 
6:165:12149:32:30:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:directional effects of priming the sample will generalize to the population as long as 0Cxx− has 
6:166:12245:30:0:72:223:154:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the same sign for both groups.  
7:167:12278:0:32:108:525:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The hypothesis that an identity norm increases patience corresponds to 0Cγγ<, where 
7:168:12362:32:30:73:529:676:153:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f4:B:γis the degree of impatient behavior. Similarly, the hypotheses that an identity norm increases 
7:169:12458:30:32:71:478:646:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:risk aversion corresponds to 0Cρρ>, where ρ is the degree of risk-averse behavior. 
7:170:12541:32:28:108:527:614:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Some psychologists have expressed the intuition that priming a category should have a 
7:171:12627:28:28:72:540:586:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:stronger effect on those who identify more strongly with that category. Our framework generates 
7:172:12723:28:31:72:513:558:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the perhaps surprising conclusion that this need not be the case. Let 0Cxx< without loss of 
7:173:12815:31:30:72:496:527:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:generality. Priming sensitivity increasing with identification strength corresponds to the 
7:174:12906:30:31:72:536:497:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:condition 2*2/dx  ds > 0, which holds in a neighborhood of s if and only if ()  0ws′′>. Depending 
7:175:13004:31:28:72:536:466:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on the shape of w(·) and the level of s, 2*2/dx  ds could take either sign. While it may be the case 
7:176:13104:28:28:71:534:438:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that individuals with higher s are more susceptible to priming (0w′′>), such individuals could 
7:177:13199:28:28:71:528:410:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:instead become saturated with the category (0w′′<). Thus, measuring the interaction between 
7:178:13291:28:28:72:407:382:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:priming and identification strength does not test the theory’s validity.

7:181:13410:27:28:72:139:299:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:A. Procedure 
7:182:13423:28:27:108:532:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Participants were Harvard College undergraduates, 71 of Asian descent and 66 of white 
7:183:13509:27:28:72:542:244:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:descent. Half the participants were randomly assigned to the ethnicity-salience condition and half 
7:184:13608:28:27:72:514:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to the control condition. Subjects responded to a “background questionnaire” that varied by 
7:185:13700:27:28:72:490:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:experimental condition, then a time preference elicitation, and finally a risk preference 
7:186:13790:28:28:72:126:161:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:elicitation. 
7:187:13803:28:27:108:525:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the ethnicity-salience condition, the “background questionnaire” included questions 
7:188:13890:27:28:72:531:106:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:about languages spoken by the subject’s family and how many generations the subject’s family 
7:189:13983:28:0:72:537:78:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:has lived in the United States. This manipulation was originally used by Margaret Shih, Todd L. 
8:190:14080:0:27:71:507:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Pittinsky, and Nalini Ambady (1999) to make ethnicity salient to Asian-Americans. In the 
8:191:14169:27:28:71:526:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:control condition, the “background questionnaire” asked about the school meal plan and cable 
8:192:14262:28:27:71:188:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:television subscription.  
8:193:14288:27:28:108:539:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We measured time preferences by asking participants to make 46 binary choices between 
8:194:14374:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a certain amount of money received earlier ($3 or $7) and a larger amount received later (either 
8:195:14471:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between $3.05 and $7, or between $7.10 and $15). Half the choices were between an immediate 
8:196:14563:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment and a payment one week later, and half the choices were between a payment one week 
8:197:14654:28:27:72:251:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:later and a payment two weeks later. 
8:198:14691:27:28:108:505:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Our approach to measuring time preferences is standard (Shane Frederick, George 
8:199:14771:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Loewenstein, and Ted O’Donoghue 2002). Similar measures predict variation in discounting-
8:200:14860:28:27:72:494:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:related behaviors such as drug addiction, cigarette smoking, excessive gambling, use of 
8:201:14948:27:28:71:516:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:commitment savings devices, borrowing on installment accounts and credit cards, and rapid

8:203:15065:27:28:107:540:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We measured risk preferences with 18 binary choices between a sure $4 and an X percent

8:205:15244:27:28:71:501:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:experimental choices such as ours are highly correlated with measures from hypothetical 
8:206:15332:28:28:71:497:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:choices, which in turn predict risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, failing to hold

9:220:16347:28:27:107:481:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: In the time preference task, our dependent variable is the log of the minimum

9:222:16516:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment. That is, we apply the log operator once to transform the reservation gross interest rate 
9:223:16614:27:28:72:522:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:into the continuously compounded net interest rate, and then we apply the log operator again. 
9:224:16708:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:The second application of the log operator causes the estimator we describe below to assume that

9:226:16902:27:28:72:530:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative discount rates. In the risk preference task, our dependent variable is the minimum risk 
9:227:16999:28:27:72:527:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:premium—that is, the expected return offered by the gamble in excess of the risk-free return—
9:228:17092:27:28:72:507:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the subject requires to accept the gamble. For example, if the subject would choose to 
9:229:17184:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:gamble for $8 rather than accept the sure $4 if and only if the probability of winning is at least 58 
9:230:17286:27:28:72:408:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:percent, then the reservation risk premium is (8 × 0.58 – 4)/4 = 0.16.8 
9:231:17357:28:28:108:533:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Because we observe choices at only a finite number of interest rates and risk premia, we 
9:232:17446:28:27:72:496:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:use an interval regression (Mark B. Stewart 1983), which is a generalization of the tobit 
9:233:17536:27:115:72:500:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimator that allows the econometrician to specify that the dependent variable value lies

9:235:17675:7:12:72:441:90:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:7 If a risk preference choice was selected for payment, the check was immediately cashable. 
9:236:17767:12:0:72:508:78:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:8 In this formula, we treat the risk choice as investing a $4 endowment into either the risk-free or risky asset. 
10:237:17882:0:27:71:513:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:somewhere within an interval. Due to outliers, we will focus on median interest rates in our 
10:238:17975:27:28:71:360:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:analysis, although means give directionally similar results.9

10:242:18135:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where subjects chose the earlier or safe option. In the unprimed condition, Asians are somewhat 
10:243:18231:27:28:72:516:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more impatient and risk averse than whites. This comparison may be confounded by sample 
10:244:18319:28:27:72:496:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:selection (both into the Harvard student body and into the experiment); in the nationally 
10:245:18409:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:representative Health and Retirement Study, middle-aged and older Asian-Americans appear to 
10:246:18501:28:28:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:be less risk averse than whites on average (Barsky et al. 1997). Even in a representative sample, 
10:247:18599:28:27:71:515:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:identity effects cannot be inferred from simple differences in measured preferences because 
10:248:18691:27:28:71:503:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:social category affiliations are confounded with many unobserved factors. To learn about 
10:249:18780:28:27:71:507:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:identity effects, we instead turn to the comparisons between treatment and control groups. 
10:250:18871:27:28:107:537:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Even though Table 1 discards all information about the prices involved in each trade-off, 
10:251:18961:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the main result of Experiment 1 is apparent: Asians make significantly fewer impatient choices 
10:252:19056:27:28:72:511:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when their ethnicity is primed. The 14 percentage point drop in the proportion of impatient 
10:253:19148:28:28:72:497:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:choices is significant at the 1 percent level. In contrast, whites seem to get slightly more 
10:254:19241:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:impatient in the ethnicity-salience condition, but the difference is not significant. The fact that 
10:255:19341:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whites do not respond to the prime is evidence that that the Asian priming effect is not driven by 
10:256:19440:28:27:72:526:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:some channel common to both Asians and whites. Neither whites nor Asians change their risk 
10:257:19531:27:41:72:277:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:choices in response to the ethnicity prime.

10:260:19747:17:15:71:493:91:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:is associated with a mean log continuously compounded interest rate ofˆμ, then the median continuously 
10:261:19850:15:0:72:219:76:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:compounded interest rate isˆexp(   )μ.

11:263:19975:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:information. We regress participants’ reservation log continuously compounded interest rate and 
11:264:20071:28:27:71:524:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:risk premium on an experimental condition dummy. The interest rate regression also includes 
11:265:20163:27:28:71:542:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dummies for whether the intertemporal choice is between payments deferred for one week versus 
11:266:20257:28:28:71:529:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:two weeks, whether the earlier payout being offered is $7, and the interaction of the above two 
11:267:20353:28:27:71:536:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dummies. We cluster standard errors in the interest rate regression by subject (Kenneth A. Froot 
11:268:20450:27:28:71:516:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:1989; William Rogers 1993). Column 1 confirms that the interest rate required by Asians to 
11:269:20541:28:27:71:522:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:defer payment falls dramatically when Asian ethnic identity is made salient. For example, for 
11:270:20635:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:trade-offs between $4 now and money one week from now, the median required interest rate falls 
11:271:20730:28:28:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from 8.8 percent to 2.1 percent. Running separate regressions for each intertemporal choice type 
11:272:20827:28:27:71:541:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(immediate payment amount × time horizon) reveals that this treatment effect is significant at the 
11:273:20926:27:28:71:521:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:1 percent level and of similar magnitude for all four types.10 Column 3 shows that there is no 
11:274:21021:28:27:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect on the risk premium Asians require to accept gambles, which is perhaps not surprising 
11:275:21114:27:28:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:given the previous literature’s ambiguous findings on Asian risk attitudes.11 Columns 2 and 4 
11:276:21208:28:27:72:524:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:show, in analogous regressions for white subjects, that whites’ choices are not affected by the

11:282:21595:12:11:72:533:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:regression must be interpreted cautiously because we did not measure immigration status for the control group and 
11:283:21709:11:7:72:338:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:so cannot include immigration status as an uninteracted regressor.

12:288:21969:28:27:107:531:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We recruited 280 Temple University students and 231 University of Michigan students. 
12:289:22054:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:We randomly assigned participants to the race-salience, gender-salience, or control conditions. 
12:290:22150:28:28:72:522:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:No blacks were assigned to the gender-salience condition due to their scarcity in the sample.  
12:291:22245:28:27:108:520:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The first section of the questionnaire contained the category-salience manipulation or 
12:292:22332:27:28:72:505:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:control questions, modeled after Shih, Pittinsky, and Ambady (1999). In the race-salience 
12:293:22422:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:condition, this section asked subjects to identify their race and opine on living with roommates of 
12:294:22522:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the same or different race. In the gender-salience condition, subjects identified their gender and 
12:295:22621:28:28:71:530:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:opined on living on a co-ed versus single-sex dormitory floor. In the control condition, the first 
12:296:22720:28:27:71:287:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:section asked about living on or off campus. 
12:297:22765:27:28:107:525:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The next three sections were a time preference elicitation, a risk preference elicitation, 
12:298:22856:28:27:71:527:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and a shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Theresa M. Marteau

12:300:23042:28:27:71:517:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:section was an eight-minute math quiz with six SAT-like questions. We paid participants 10 
12:301:23133:27:28:71:500:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cents for each correctly answered math question. The final section asked questions about 
12:302:23222:28:28:71:532:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:personal and family background. Participants were paid for their choices by check immediately 
12:303:23316:28:27:71:233:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:upon completing the experiment. 
12:304:23348:27:28:107:539:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We measured time preferences by asking participants to make 24 binary choices between 
12:305:23434:28:27:71:518:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:$10 earlier and some larger amount later, ranging from $10.10 to $15. Half the choices were 
12:306:23526:27:28:71:501:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between an immediate payment and a payment one week later, and half the choices were 
12:307:23611:28:28:71:531:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between a payment one week later and a payment two weeks later. One question in this section 
12:308:23704:28:0:71:531:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was randomly chosen for payment. Delayed payments were implemented via post-dated check. 
13:309:23795:0:27:71:494:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:The section’s instructions made it clear that the questions were not intended to evaluate 
13:310:23885:27:28:71:511:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:performance: “It’s important to keep in mind that there are no right or wrong answers here. 
13:311:23977:28:27:71:540:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Which choice you make is a matter of personal preference.” We used this same wording again in 
13:312:24071:27:28:71:316:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the instructions for the risk preference elicitations. 
13:313:24126:28:28:108:507:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We elicited small-stakes risk preferences by asking participants to make six binary 
13:314:24210:28:27:71:527:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:choices between $1 for sure and a 50 percent chance at a larger amount, ranging from $1.60 to 
13:315:24304:27:28:71:492:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:$3.60. All six choices affected each subject’s payment. We measured larger-stakes risk

13:317:24483:27:28:71:481:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and there was only a small chance that the subject’s choice would be implemented.12

13:328:25266:28:27:72:516:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reflected in their baseline choices. For instance, blacks are on average more risk averse than 
13:329:25361:27:25:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whites in nationally representative data (on middle-aged and older Americans; see Sahm 2007), 
13:330:25455:25:8:216:219:132:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:                                                 
13:331:25503:8:11:72:531:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:12 Any money participants earned from their risk choices was paid with a check that could be cashed immediately. 
13:332:25616:11:16:72:532:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:13 To be clear that they are not driving our results, we have dropped the four native blacks who were over 22 years 
13:333:25732:16:12:72:512:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:old, all of whom were randomized into the race-salience treatment. These subjects—ages 23, 23, 34, and 47—
13:334:25838:12:11:72:541:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:differed from other subjects along many dimensions. Our priming results are qualitatively similar if we include these 
13:335:25956:11:0:72:128:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:four subjects. 
14:336:25973:0:27:71:526:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whereas our unprimed native black subjects choose the safe payment less often than our white 
14:337:26066:27:28:71:489:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subjects. We identify identity effects by comparing unprimed participants with primed 
14:338:26152:28:27:71:289:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:participants within each demographic group. 
14:339:26196:27:28:107:531:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Table 3 shows that when we discard all price information, we do not find any treatment 
14:340:26283:28:28:71:516:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects that reach statistical significance. Table 4 presents regression evidence incorporating 
14:341:26379:28:27:71:527:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:price information. Our econometric methodology is similar to that used for Experiment 1. The 
14:342:26472:27:28:71:532:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dependent variable is either the log of the continuously compounded reservation interest rate or 
14:343:26569:28:27:71:507:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the reservation risk premium. The explanatory variables are a dummy for whether a social 
14:344:26658:27:28:71:512:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:category is being made salient, a tradeoff type dummy (whether the intertemporal choice is 
14:345:26749:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between payments deferred for one week versus two weeks, or whether the sure payout in the 
14:346:26840:28:27:71:514:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:risky choice is $100), a dummy for whether the subjects were recruited at Michigan, and an 
14:347:26931:27:28:71:370:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interaction between the tradeoff type and Michigan dummies. 
14:348:26991:28:27:107:519:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In Panel A, we see that making race salient to native blacks significantly lowers their 
14:349:27079:27:28:71:502:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reservation interest rate for deferring receipt of payment.14 For example, fitted regression 
14:350:27172:28:27:72:533:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates from the table indicate that when choosing between money now and money one week 
14:351:27262:27:28:72:501:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from now, the median continuously compounded reservation interest rate among Temple 
14:352:27346:28:28:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students falls from 23.2 percent to 10.9 percent. In contrast, race salience has no effect on white 
14:353:27446:28:38:71:539:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and immigrant black reservation interest rates.15 It appears that racial identity effects on discount 
14:354:27548:38:8:216:219:201:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:                                                 
14:355:27596:8:16:72:542:193:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:14 The difference in the statistical significance of the native black priming effect in Table 3 versus Table 4 is mainly 
14:356:27717:16:11:72:544:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:due  to  the  fact  that  the  reservation  continuously  compounded  interest  rate  is  close  to  log-normally  distributed.  
14:357:27846:11:12:72:544:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Therefore,  using  the  log  of  the  continuously  compounded  interest  rate  as  the  dependent  variable  in  a  regression  
14:358:27975:12:11:72:544:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:results  in  an  efficient  estimate  of  the  median.  The  comparison  of  percentages  in  Table  3  did  not  utilize  such  a  
14:359:28107:11:12:72:545:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:transformation,  resulting  in  an  inefficient  estimate.  Note  that  we  had  subjects  make  many  more  intertemporal  
14:360:28231:12:11:72:543:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:choices in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, so the inefficient estimator used in Table 1 still has sufficient power 
14:361:28349:11:7:72:211:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:to detect the Asian priming effect. 
14:362:28385:7:16:72:543:113:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:15 The difference between the native black coefficient and the white coefficient is significant at the 10 percent level 
14:363:28505:16:12:71:542:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:(p = 0.06), as is the difference between the native black and immigrant black coefficients (p = 0.10). However, these 
14:364:28623:12:11:71:542:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:comparisons must be interpreted carefully, since the dependent variable has been transformed by two applications of 
14:365:28739:11:0:71:543:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:the  log  function.  A  one  unit  movement  in  the  transformed  interest  rate  does  not  translate  to  an  equivalent  size  
15:366:28872:0:27:71:531:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rates do not cause the capital accumulation gap between blacks and whites, and between native 
15:367:28966:27:28:71:181:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and immigrant blacks. 
15:368:28988:28:27:108:508:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The last two columns of Table 4’s Panel A show that making gender salient has no 
15:369:29069:27:28:71:498:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant effects on either men’s or women’s patience. Panel B shows that there are no 
15:370:29158:28:28:71:528:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant priming effects on any of the groups’ risk aversions either. In particular, there is no 
15:371:29258:28:27:71:495:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indication that male identity contains a stronger risk-seeking norm than female identity. 
15:372:29348:27:28:108:529:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Subjects who did not believe that our preference elicitations were incentive-compatible 
15:373:29436:28:27:71:511:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may have made low-quality decisions or acted strategically (rather than reporting their true 
15:374:29529:27:28:71:526:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:preferences), adding noise and bias to our treatment effect estimates. Therefore, an interesting 
15:375:29626:28:28:71:530:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subsample is the set of subjects who reported in the debriefing questionnaire that they believed 
15:376:29723:28:27:71:454:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that they would be paid exactly as promised in the experimental instructions.16  
15:377:29804:27:28:107:541:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Our first question regarding payment credibility asked, “Throughout this experiment, you 
15:378:29893:28:27:71:540:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:made choices that involved various amounts of money. We said that your responses would affect 
15:379:29987:27:28:71:532:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:how much you get paid, but you may not have believed us. Did you believe that your responses 
15:380:30080:28:27:71:521:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would affect how much you get paid?” The second question asked, “Think back to when you 
15:381:30168:27:28:71:524:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:were answering questions about getting a certain amount of money today versus getting some 
15:382:30259:28:28:71:541:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:different amount of money in a week. Did you believe that you would actually get paid in a week 
15:383:30355:28:50:71:281:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:if you chose to take the money in a week?” 
15:384:30398:50:12:539:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:                                                                                                                                                             
15:385:30554:12:11:72:543:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:movement  in  the  untransformed  interest  rate,  which  is  the  price  that  is  relevant  to  subjects.  To  get  a  sense  of  the  
15:386:30691:11:12:72:543:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:magnitudes  in  the  untransformed  scale,  we  perform  a  calculation  similar  to  the  one  in  the  main  text  and  find  that  
15:387:30825:12:11:72:544:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:primed  Temple  whites’  median  reservation  interest  rate  falls  by  only  0.4  percentage  points,  and  primed  Temple  
15:388:30951:11:12:72:544:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:immigrant  blacks’  median  reservation  interest  rate  falls  by  only  0.7  percentage  points.  Analogous  calculations  for  
15:389:31081:12:7:72:232:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Michigan subjects yield similar results. 
15:390:31122:7:16:72:544:124:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:16  We  did  not  measure  our  credibility  among  Experiment  1  subjects.  Experiment  1  was  conducted  on  Harvard  
15:391:31244:16:11:72:542:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:undergraduates  by  the  third  author,  who  was  also  a  Harvard  undergraduate  at  the  time.  We  had  no  affiliation  with  
15:392:31376:11:12:72:543:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Temple,  and  only  a  temporary  non-faculty  affiliation  with  the  University  of  Michigan.  In  subsequent  experiments  
15:393:31503:12:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:similar to Experiment 2 (but with a different priming manipulation) at one of our home institutions, we find belief 
15:394:31619:11:0:72:495:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:rates around 80 percent, suggesting that credibility is in fact much higher when social distance is smaller. 
16:395:31730:0:27:108:507:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In a Web appendix table, we show that the category salience manipulations had no 
16:396:31811:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:statistically significant effect on belief in our payment promises, but between 35 and 53 percent 
16:397:31909:28:27:72:496:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of subjects within each demographic group × experimental condition cell reported some 
16:398:31995:27:28:72:530:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:disbelief. Other studies have shown that without financial incentives, experimental participants 
16:399:32092:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:behave more randomly and exert less effort (see Colin F. Camerer and Robin M. Hogarth 1999 
16:400:32183:28:27:72:527:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for a literature review). We have suggestive evidence that this is true among our skeptics. One 
16:401:32279:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:measure of participants’ cognitive effort is whether their choices are “well-behaved”—choosing 
16:402:32374:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the delayed payment if and only if the interest rate exceeds exactly one threshold, and choosing 
16:403:32471:27:28:72:512:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the gamble if and only if the risk premium exceeds exactly one threshold.17 Respectively, 7 
16:404:32563:28:28:72:506:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:percent and 21 percent of participants who did not believe our payment promises failed to 
16:405:32653:28:27:72:521:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:answer the intertemporal and risk questions in a well-behaved manner. These proportions are 
16:406:32745:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:greater than the 5 percent and 16 percent of believers who made poorly behaved intertemporal or 
16:407:32841:28:27:72:505:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:risk choices, but it should be noted that these differences are not statistically significant.18 
16:408:32937:27:28:72:475:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Because dropping self-reported skeptics causes us to discard so much data, subjects 
16:409:33021:28:27:72:522:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:endogenously chose their response to the belief questions, and merely asking questions about 
16:410:33114:27:28:72:532:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment credibility may have generated skepticism ex post even if none was present during the 
16:411:33208:28:28:72:515:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:preference elicitations, the subsample results that follow should be interpreted with caution. 
16:412:33303:28:27:108:533:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In Table 5, we exclude subjects who did not believe that their choices would affect their 
16:413:33393:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:payment. For our time preference regressions, we additionally drop subjects who did not believe 
16:414:33489:28:29:72:508:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:they would receive deferred payments. We find that restricting our sample to self-reported 
16:415:33580:29:8:216:219:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:                                                 
16:416:33628:8:11:72:475:147:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:17 Our results are qualitatively similar when excluding subjects whose choices were poorly behaved. 
16:417:33728:11:16:72:543:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:18  Non-believers  also  made  a  higher  fraction  of  impatient  choices  (p  =  0.02)  and  cautious  choices  (not  statistically  
16:418:33863:16:12:72:543:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:significant),  which  is  consistent  with  their  exerting  less  cognitive  effort  (Daniel  J.  Benjamin,  Sebastian  A.  Brown,  
16:419:33996:12:11:71:543:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:and Jesse M. Shapiro 2006). Charles A. Holt and Susan K. Laury (2002) find that subjects become less risk averse 
16:420:34109:11:12:71:544:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:when  they  are  not  offered  incentives.  Our  results  may  not  be  inconsistent  with  Holt  and  Laury’s  because  they  
16:421:34236:12:11:71:544:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:explicitly  told  their  subjects  that  the  choices  were  hypothetical,  whereas  our  non-believing  subjects  apparently  
16:422:34363:11:0:71:278:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:believed we were deceiving them about incentives. 
17:423:34415:0:27:71:535:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:believers qualitatively changes some of our results. Although the point estimate for the effect of 
17:424:34514:27:28:71:515:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:priming race on time preference is nearly identical in the full native black sample and in the 
17:425:34609:28:27:71:486:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:restricted native black sample (which is 41 percent smaller), the effect loses statistical 
17:426:34700:27:28:71:508:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significance in the restricted sample. Priming race also causes white discount rates to drop 
17:427:34793:28:28:71:539:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significantly among believers, suggesting that there may be a patient white racial norm as well.19 
17:428:34891:28:27:108:539:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the risk domain for the restricted sample, we find that priming racial identity raises the 
17:429:34985:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reservation native black risk premium among believers by 23 percentage points, a change that is 
17:430:35081:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant at the 1 percent level. In contrast, immigrant blacks’ required risk premium falls by 
17:431:35179:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:11 percentage points when race is salient, although the drop is not statistically different from 
17:432:35276:28:28:72:539:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:zero. The native black priming effect on risk aversion is statistically different from the white and 
17:433:35377:28:27:72:500:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:immigrant black priming effects (both p-values < 0.01). This result is consistent with the 
17:434:35468:27:28:72:471:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesis that racial risk norms depress native blacks’ stock market participation.

17:437:35593:28:27:72:536:322:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:Stereotype threat, lift, and emotional states. Many researchers have documented the “stereotype 
17:438:35689:27:28:71:537:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:threat” phenomenon: making race or gender salient impairs the cognitive performance of groups 
17:439:35783:28:28:71:519:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with stereotypically poor performance. Conversely, making negative stereotypes about other 
17:440:35873:28:27:71:500:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:groups salient improves cognitive performance, a finding dubbed “stereotype lift.”20 It is 
17:441:35964:27:69:72:539:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:believed that stereotype threat and lift effects operate through increasing or reducing anxiety that

17:443:36113:7:16:72:542:136:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:19 Race (e.g. white) is distinct from ethnicity (e.g. German). The priming effect on whites in Experiment 2 should be 
17:444:36231:16:12:72:542:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:interpreted as a race salience effect on whites. For whites in Experiment 1, the priming effect should be interpreted 
17:445:36349:12:7:71:417:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:as an ethnicity salience effect for the various ethnicities relevant to the white subjects. 
17:446:36441:7:16:72:544:101:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:20  Studies  documenting  stereotype  threat  and  lift  include  Claude  M.  Steele  and  Joshua  Aronson  (1995),  Shih,  
17:447:36565:16:11:72:542:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Pittinsky, and Ambady (1999), Gregory M. Walton and Geoffrey L. Cohen (2003), David M. Marx and Diederik A. 
17:448:36673:11:0:72:244:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Stapel (2006), and Thomas S. Dee (2008). 
18:449:36716:0:27:71:535:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:one will confirm negative stereotypes about one’s group. Consistent with this mechanism, these 
18:450:36811:27:28:71:481:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects vanish when tasks are presented to subjects as not being diagnostic of ability. 
18:451:36899:28:27:108:542:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:A possible explanation for our results is that the category primes affected subjects’ ability 
18:452:36993:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to compute expected values and interest rates. We think this explanation is unlikely because we 
18:453:37089:28:28:72:533:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:did not present the preference elicitation questions as being diagnostic of ability. In Experiment 
18:454:37188:28:27:72:495:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2, we explicitly told subjects that there are no right or wrong answers for the preference 
18:455:37279:27:28:72:177:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:elicitation questions.  
18:456:37303:28:27:108:540:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:However, even if stereotype threat and lift effects on cognitive ability were not present, it 
18:457:37397:27:28:72:507:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is possible that the priming questions induced changes in subjects’ emotional states which 
18:458:37488:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:affected their expressed preferences. For example, if certain priming questions agitated subjects, 
18:459:37587:28:27:72:500:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:their willingness to delay payment receipt or take risks may change (Loewenstein 2000). 
18:460:37675:27:28:108:514:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:To check that our results are not being driven by stereotype threat, stereotype lift, or 
18:461:37764:28:27:72:515:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:emotional changes, we examine how the primes affected performance on the five math quiz 
18:462:37852:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:questions administered after the elicitations and responses to the anxiety inventory. The primes 
18:463:37949:28:27:72:467:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:had no effect on math quiz performance or anxiety (results not shown in tables).21

18:468:38332:12:11:72:543:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:our math quiz, which was administered approximately 12 minutes after the prime. We can confirm that our priming 
18:469:38444:11:12:72:542:166:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:effect on time preference persists for at least 12 minutes because we varied the order of the preference elicitations 
18:470:38562:12:11:72:543:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:(in  Experiment  2).  In  fact,  the  priming  effect  is  largest immediately  before  the  math  quiz,  although  this  is  mainly  
18:471:38696:11:12:72:543:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:driven by control subjects becoming more impatient, rather than primed subjects becoming more patient. We thank a 
18:472:38810:12:11:72:543:131:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:referee  for  pointing  out  that,  even  if  stereotype  threat  did  not  affect  the  preference  elicitations,  one  might  have  
18:473:38944:11:12:72:543:120:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:expected  stereotype  threat  to  be  activated  for  the  math  questions,  since  they  are  clearly  diagnostic  of  ability.  The  
18:474:39079:12:11:72:543:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:lack of such an effect here may be due to the many non-diagnostic tasks performed between the prime and the math 
18:475:39192:11:12:72:544:97:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:quiz.  Stereotype  threat  studies  typically  administer  the  diagnostic  task  immediately  after  the  identity-relevant  
18:476:39318:12:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:questions and present the task as the focus of the researchers’ interest, making it more likely that subjects will infer 
18:477:39439:11:0:72:380:74:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:that their performance on that task will be used to judge their race or gender.

19:479:39615:27:28:71:531:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:our priming effects could be explained by a “demand effect” that caused participants to behave 
19:480:39710:28:27:71:394:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in the way they thought the experimenters wanted them to behave.

19:482:39864:28:28:71:501:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:you were making choices about money. While you were making those choices, were you 
19:483:39947:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:thinking about what we wanted you to do?” Ninety percent of subjects circled the answer, “No, I 
19:484:40043:27:28:71:534:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was making the choice I wanted to make. I was not thinking about what the experimenter might 
19:485:40136:28:27:71:538:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:want me to choose.” Of those who instead circled yes, most made innocuous guesses about what 
19:486:40229:27:28:71:535:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the experimenters wanted (like “to see whether or not we were risk takers with money”), and no 
19:487:40324:28:28:71:525:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:one made a guess related to race or gender. Our results are qualitatively similar when we drop

19:491:40598:27:28:71:541:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:many hypotheses. One way to gain a sense for the likelihood that our results are driven by Type I 
19:492:40696:28:27:71:521:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:error is to see if the priming effects are consistent at both schools in which we collected data. 
19:493:40794:27:28:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Running regressions separately for each school, we find that the native black discount rate effect 
19:494:40893:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is strong among the Michigan subjects, where the identity salience coefficient is –1.628 and the 
19:495:40990:28:27:71:539:239:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:p-value is 0.006. The effect is also negative among the native black subjects at Temple, although 
19:496:41088:27:28:71:478:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the identity salience coefficient is smaller (–0.281) and the p-value is larger (0.353).

19:500:41455:28:0:71:520:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the race priming effect on immigrant blacks’ reservation risk premium is negative at both

20:502:41644:27:28:71:527:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and immigrant black race priming effects on the risk premium is 0.045 at Temple and 0.059 at

20:508:41960:28:27:108:523:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Our results suggest that social identity affects fundamental economic preferences. We 
20:509:42046:27:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:find that making Asian-American subjects’ ethnicity salient causes them to exhibit more patient 
20:510:42142:28:28:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:preferences. Making race salient to black subjects decreases discount rates among those who 
20:511:42234:28:27:72:534:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have longstanding roots in the U.S. There is also suggestive evidence that native blacks become 
20:512:42330:27:28:72:444:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more risk averse and whites more patient when their racial identity is salient. 
20:513:42410:28:27:108:533:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Understanding identity salience effects is important for at least two reasons. First, as we 
20:514:42502:27:28:72:498:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have emphasized in this paper, identity salience manipulations are an empirical tool that 
20:515:42592:28:27:72:498:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economists can use to test theories about how steady-state identity affiliations matter for 
20:516:42684:27:28:72:510:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:behavior. Second, identity primes may in themselves have important real-world behavioral 
20:517:42773:28:28:72:520:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consequences. If being the only female in line at the polling booth primes the gender identity 
20:518:42868:28:27:72:530:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:category, then it may influence the woman to vote for a female candidate.22 An American-born 
20:519:42961:27:28:71:542:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:black worker who is enrolling in his 401(k) may, due to a transitory racial prime, choose a higher 
20:520:43060:28:27:71:514:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:savings rate. Even though his discount rate was only temporarily depressed, a large body of 
20:521:43152:27:28:71:518:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:empirical evidence has shown that most households’ retirement savings decisions are highly

30:899:68457:12:10:72:531:175:81:Times:81:Times:F:Notes: This table presents interval regressions where the latent dependent variable is the log continuously compounded interest 
30:900:68585:10:10:72:540:165:81:Times:81:Times:F:rate required to defer payment receipt or the risk premium required to accept a gamble. We pool each subject’s two intertemporal 
30:901:68714:10:11:72:539:155:81:Times:81:Times:F:choices together and each subject’s two risk choices together. Social Category Salient is a dummy for the race-salience treatment 
30:902:68844:11:10:72:538:144:81:Times:81:Times:F:(first three columns) or the gender-salience treatment (last two columns). 1 Week vs. 2 Weeks is a dummy for if the intertemporal 
30:903:68974:10:10:72:529:134:81:Times:81:Times:F:choice was between payments deferred for one week versus two weeks. Larger Stakes is a dummy for if the sure payout in the 
30:904:69097:10:12:72:527:124:81:Times:81:Times:F:risky choice was $100. UMich is a dummy for whether the subject was recruited at the University of Michigan. The estimated 
30:905:69220:12:11:72:516:112:81:Times:81:Times:F:conditional standard deviation of the latent dependent variable is denoted by ˆ.σ Huber-White standard errors, clustered by 
30:906:69343:11:10:72:530:101:81:Times:81:Times:F:subject, are reported in parentheses below the point estimates. The final row of each panel reports the number of choices in the 
30:907:69472:10:0:72:380:91:81:Times:81:Times:F:regressions. * Significant at the 5 percent level. ** Significant at the 1 percent level.
