2:25:1088:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Since  the  1990s,  China's  real  estate  market  has  experienced  a  dramatic  and  long-lasting  boom 
2:26:1194:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:across China. This boom has led to substantial concerns in both academic and policy circles that 
2:27:1290:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:the  rising housing  prices  might  have  developed  into  a  gigantic  housing  bubble,  which  might 
2:28:1392:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:eventually burst and damage China’s financial system and economy. Motivated by this concern, 
2:29:1484:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:this  paper  reviews the  historical  development  of  China’s  real  estate  market,  describes  the  real 
2:30:1591:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:estate  boom,  and  discusses its  links  to  households,  local  governments,  firms  and  the  financial 
2:31:1697:14:42:72:108:504:12:Times:12:Times:system.

3:47:1982:21:21:72:75:660:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:48:1982:21:20:96:543:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The real estate market is not only a key part of the Chinese economy but also an integral 
3:49:2072:20:21:72:543:619:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:component  of  China’s  financial  system.  In  2017,  housing  sales  totaled  13.37  trillion  RMB, 
3:50:2174:21:21:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equivalent to 16.4% of China’s GDP. The real estate market is also deeply connected to China’s 
3:51:2269:21:20:72:543:577:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financial  system  through  several  important  channels.  First,  housing  holdings  are  the  biggest 
3:52:2373:20:21:72:543:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:component  of  Chinese  households’  asset  portfolios,  partly  due  to  a  lack  of  other  investment 
3:53:2478:21:21:72:543:536:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vehicles for both households and firms in China’s still underdeveloped financial markets. Second, 
3:54:2576:21:21:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s local governments heavily rely on land sale revenues and use future land sale revenues as 
3:55:2674:21:20:72:543:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:collateral to raise debt financing through “Local Government Financing Platform” (LGFP). Third, 
3:56:2770:20:21:72:540:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms also rely on real estate assets as collateral to borrow, and since 2007, firms, especially well-
3:57:2872:21:21:72:543:453:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capitalized firms, have engaged heavily in acquiring land for investment purposes. Finally, banks 
3:58:2970:21:20:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are heavily exposed to real estate risks through loans made to households, real estate developers, 
3:59:3069:20:29:72:534:412:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local governments, and firms that are either explicitly or implicitly backed by real estate assets.  
3:60:3170:29:21:96:543:383:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Figure 1 provides an estimate made by the Deutsche Bank Report (2016) of the exposure of 
3:61:3259:21:20:72:540:362:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s banking system to the real estate market. Through the third quarter of 2016, property-
3:62:3353:20:21:72:543:342:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:related loans totaled 55 trillion RMB, accounting for about 25% of China’s banking assets. Among 
3:63:3450:21:21:72:543:321:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these  loans,  mortgage  loans  to  households  accounted  for  17.9  trillion,  loans  to  real  estate 
3:64:3555:21:20:72:542:300:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:developers accounted for 14.8 trillion (including 7 trillion in regular loans, 6.3 trillion in credit 
3:65:3657:20:21:72:543:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:through shadow banking, and 1.5 trillion through domestic bond issuance), and loans collateralized 
3:66:3756:21:21:72:543:259:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:by real estate assets to firms and local governments accounted for 22.2 trillion. This heavy real 
3:67:3854:21:21:72:542:238:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estate exposure of banks makes the real estate market systemically important in China’s financial 
3:68:3952:21:69:72:111:217:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system.

4:78:4476:37:21:96:543:490:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Since the 1990s, the real estate market has experienced a dramatic and long-lasting boom 
4:79:4565:21:21:72:543:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across China. This boom has led to substantial concerns in both academic and policy circles, e.g., 
4:80:4664:21:21:72:543:448:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wu, Gyouko, and Deng (2016), Chen and Wen (2017), Glaeser et al. (2017), and Song and Xiong 
4:81:4756:21:20:72:543:427:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2018), that the rising housing prices might have developed into a gigantic housing bubble, which 
4:82:4854:20:21:72:543:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:might eventually burst and damage China’s financial system and economy. Motivated by this 
4:83:4944:21:21:72:542:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:concern, this chapter reviews the historical development of China’s real estate market in Section 
4:84:5042:21:20:72:542:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:I, describes the real estate boom in Section II, discusses how the real estate market is linked to 
4:85:5141:20:21:72:543:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households in Section III, how it is linked to local governments in Section IV, and how it is linked 
4:86:5242:21:21:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to firms in Section V. After covering these important aspects of China’s real estate market, in 
4:87:5338:21:20:72:543:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Section VI we discuss why we do not expect a sudden nationwide real estate crash in China, but 
4:88:5433:20:37:72:489:283:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:highlight several key factors regarding the sustainability of the market going forward.  
4:89:5522:37:37:174:439:246:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:I. Development of China’s Real Estate Market 
4:90:5566:37:21:95:543:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The  development  of  China’s  real estate  market  is  deeply  rooted in  its  great  economic 
4:91:5662:21:28:71:479:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transition process. This section reviews several critical features of this development. 
4:92:5750:28:29:71:160:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Housing reforms 
4:93:5766:29:21:95:542:131:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China experienced a series of market-oriented housing reforms in the 1990s. Housing reforms 
4:94:5858:21:20:71:543:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were initiated in 1994 when the government allowed state sector employees to purchase full or 
4:95:5952:20:0:71:543:90:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:partial property rights to their current apartment units at subsidized prices, which was essentially 
5:96:6056:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:welfare for state employees. In 1998, the Chinese government abolished this welfare housing 
5:97:6148:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system when it targeted the real estate sector as a new engine of economic growth in response to 
5:98:6245:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  adverse  effects  generated  by  the  1997  Asian  Financial  Crisis.  After  this  reform,  Chinese 
5:99:6351:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:citizens working for the government or government-related organizations could no longer purchase 
5:100:6448:20:29:72:400:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing at discount, unleashing a flood of private housing demand.  
5:101:6516:29:21:95:547:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The privatization of housing has had profound impacts on the Chinese economy. Wang (2011) 
5:102:6606:21:20:71:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:finds that by allowing households to increase their housing consumption, the reform laid a solid 
5:103:6703:20:21:72:542:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:foundation for subsequent increases in housing prices. Other studies suggest that the dramatic 
5:104:6798:21:21:72:543:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transformation of housing from state-owned to private stimulated entrepreneurship in China by 
5:105:6892:21:21:72:542:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:alleviating credit constraints, e.g., Wang (2012), and was associated with substantial increases in 
5:106:6992:21:28:72:306:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income inequality, e.g., Novokmet et al. (2018). 
5:107:7041:28:21:96:543:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As an important impetus to the development of the private real estate market, in 1998 the 
5:108:7131:21:21:72:543:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:People’s  Bank  of  China  (PBC)  outlined  procedures  for  home  buyers  to  obtain  residential 
5:109:7230:21:20:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mortgages  at  subsidized  interest  rates.  Moreover,  between  1998 and  2002,  the  PBC  lowered 
5:110:7330:20:21:72:543:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mortgage interest rate five times to stimulate private home purchases. By 2005, China had become 
5:111:7427:21:21:72:542:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the largest residential mortgage market in Asia. According to PBC reports, China’s mortgage loans 
5:112:7525:21:20:72:542:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reached 17.9 trillion RMB in 2016, equivalent to 25% of the country’s GDP that year. At the same 
5:113:7622:20:21:72:543:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:time, the PBC also developed other policies to support the housing market, including broadening 
5:114:7718:21:21:72:542:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  scope  of  real  estate  loans  and  allowing  pre-sales  by  developers.  Taken  together,  the 
5:115:7820:21:21:72:542:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:abolishment of welfare housing distribution, along with the introduction of residential mortgage 
5:116:7917:21:28:72:372:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:loans, stimulated the take-off of China’s great housing boom.  
5:117:7980:28:29:72:187:250:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Urbanization process  
5:118:8002:29:21:96:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s urbanization process has traveled down a winding road. China had an overpopulated 
5:119:8092:21:20:72:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and poor agrarian economy when Deng Xiaoping initiated the Opening-up Reform in 1978. In 
5:120:8181:20:21:72:542:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:order to ensure a stable food supply and maintain adequate public services to urban citizens, China 
5:121:8281:21:21:72:543:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:used to have strict regulations on rural-to-urban migration, known as the Hukou system. This strict 
5:122:8381:21:20:72:543:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system not only distorted China’s labor market but also dragged down the development of China’s 
5:123:8477:20:0:72:152:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing market. 
6:124:8496:0:20:96:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s  10th  Five-Year  Plan,  passed  in  2001,  set  urbanization  as  a  national  strategy  to 
6:125:8597:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stimulate demand and make the housing market a new engine of China’s economic growth. In 
6:126:8686:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:accordance with this national strategy, the State Council issued a formal document that allowed 
6:127:8782:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:free rural-to-urban migration for counties and small towns. The urban-rural divide in the Hukou 
6:128:8877:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system ended in 2014 when the State Council completely abolished the urban and rural dual 
6:129:8967:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:structure for labeling Chinese citizens’ residence. Chinese citizens are now free to move to urban 
6:130:9066:21:21:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:areas, except a small number of large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Figure 2 shows the 
6:131:9160:21:20:72:542:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:steady growth in the urbanization rate from 1990 to 2016. Interestingly, urbanization is still in 
6:132:9258:20:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:progress, with more than 40% of Chinese citizens still living in rural areas at the end of 2016. By 
6:133:9358:21:21:72:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:depicting the completion of new homes in each year, Figure 2 also shows rapid increases in new 
6:134:9453:21:20:72:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:home construction before 2012. Construction of new homes flattened out after 2012 and even 
6:135:9544:20:281:72:396:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dropped in 2015, indicating a slowdown in the construction boom.

6:139:9701:43:21:96:542:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In a recent study, Garriga et al. (2017) build a multi-sector dynamic general-equilibrium 
6:140:9791:21:0:72:542:99:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:model  to  study  the  rural-to-urban  structural  transformation  in China’s  housing  market.  Their 
7:141:9897:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quantitative analysis suggests that the urbanization process accounts for about 80% of the growth 
7:142:9995:20:29:72:231:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in China’s urban housing prices.

7:144:10040:29:20:96:542:630:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s  housing  market  development  has  been  accompanied  by  a  hotly  debated 
7:145:10125:20:21:72:543:610:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:phenomenon—the so-called “ghost towns”— as discussed by Shepard (2015) and Woodworth and 
7:146:10214:21:21:72:543:589:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wallace (2017). One can often find newly constructed but mostly empty urban districts, usually in 
7:147:10312:21:20:72:542:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:areas  far  away  from  traditional city  centers.  Well-known  examples  include  Ordos  in  Inner 
7:148:10412:20:21:72:543:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Mongolia and Zhengdong New District in Henan Province. More generally, China’s urbanization 
7:149:10504:21:21:72:542:527:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:features a high vacancy rate in cities. According to data constructed for 36 cities by Glaeser et al. 
7:150:10606:21:21:72:540:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2017), the housing vacancy rate rose sharply after 2009 across first-, second-, third, and fourth-
7:151:10705:21:20:72:542:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tier cities, as shown in Figure 3.1 This observation has led to serious concerns given that a high 
7:152:10804:20:29:72:467:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vacancy rate is commonly regarded as an indicator of a potential housing bubble.  
7:153:10886:29:21:96:543:436:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Note that the massive urbanization process naturally leads to a high vacancy rate in the early 
7:154:10981:21:20:72:543:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stages of developing a new district. It is common for local governments across China to develop 
7:155:11077:20:21:72:542:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:new districts on empty land far away from city centers. A typical development process starts with 
7:156:11175:21:21:72:543:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the local government outlining a master plan for commercial and residential properties to be built 
7:157:11274:21:20:72:543:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the new district, along with supporting public infrastructure projects, such as roads, water and 
7:158:11374:20:21:72:543:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:power plants, public schools, and hospitals. It may take several phases for a new district to become 
7:159:11475:21:21:72:542:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fully occupied and prosperous. In the first phase, the local government uses the master plan to 
7:160:11571:21:21:72:542:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attract developers to buy land and build commercial and residential properties in the district. It 
7:161:11670:21:20:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:may take 1 to 5 years for the property and infrastructure projects to gradually start up. In this phase, 
7:162:11775:20:21:72:543:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the local government also starts the infrastructure projects. Property buyers start to acquire housing 
7:163:11878:21:21:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:units  in  this  early  phase,  mostly  driven  by  investment  interests,  and  the  occupancy  rate  for 
7:164:11985:21:20:72:542:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:completed residential properties is low. In the second phase, which may be 6 to 10 years after the 
7:165:12084:20:28:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:launch of the new district, most of the construction is completed and the occupancy rate gradually

7:167:12243:9:16:72:542:151:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1 Cities in China are typically classified into four different tiers according to their administrative ranking and economic 
7:168:12367:16:12:71:542:135:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:importance. The widely accepted first-tier cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The second tier is 
7:169:12484:12:12:71:542:123:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:generally comprised of 2 autonomous municipalities (Tianjing and Chongqing), the capital cities of 24 provinces and 
7:170:12600:12:13:71:542:111:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:9 vital industrial and commercial centers. Lasha, the capital of Tibet, is typically excluded from the list due to its 
7:171:12719:13:12:71:542:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:special economic status. All cities in the first and second tiers are national (or at least regional) industrial or commercial 
7:172:12845:12:0:71:104:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:centers. 
8:173:12857:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rises over time. It often helps if the local government moves some of its agencies and bureaus into 
8:174:12957:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the new district, which serves as a stimulus for commercial businesses, such as restaurants and 
8:175:13053:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shops, to move in with the state employees. It may take more than 10 years for the new district to 
8:176:13152:21:20:71:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:become fully occupied. This marks the third phase—commercial businesses are in full operation 
8:177:13246:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and  living  conditions  in  the  district  become  comfortable.  Only at  this  time  do  commercial 
8:178:13348:21:257:71:528:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:businesses in the district become profitable and a secondary housing market becomes active.

8:182:13527:43:21:96:543:268:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As a result of this long development process, it is not surprising to see a high vacancy rate in 
8:183:13624:21:21:71:542:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the first and second phases of a new district. Nevertheless, several factors may exacerbate the high 
8:184:13725:21:21:71:543:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vacancy rate and lead to ghost towns that remain unoccupied for prolonged periods. First, as we 
8:185:13821:21:20:71:543:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:will discuss later, land sale revenues are an important source of local governments’ fiscal budgets. 
8:186:13922:20:21:71:542:185:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This distinct institutional feature may incentivize local governments to overdevelop new districts 
8:187:14021:21:21:71:542:164:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and real estate projects. Second, as part of the national urbanization process, small cities have 
8:188:14119:21:28:71:398:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experienced an outflow of residents to first- and second-tier cities.   
8:189:14191:28:21:96:542:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:There is an extensive body of literature on China’s ghost towns. Woodworth and Wallace 
8:190:14278:21:0:71:542:94:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2017) characterize some stylized facts. Zhang, Jia, and Yang (2016) relate high vacancy rates in 
9:191:14379:0:20:72:547:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Chinese cities to rising income inequality, measured by the income GINI index. Anglin et al. (2014) 
9:192:14479:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Wang, Zhang, and Zhou (2018) show that the career concerns of local government officials, 
9:193:14573:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:combined with China’s land leasehold system and fiscal system, help to explain their outward 
9:194:14666:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:development tendency (i.e., their preference to build new urban districts). The decentralized spatial 
9:195:14768:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:distribution of Chinese cities can also be partially attributed to the fast development of China’s 
9:196:14867:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:infrastructure system, including urban railroad and highway systems, as argued by Baum-Snow et 
9:197:14962:21:37:72:125:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:al. (2017). 
9:198:14974:37:36:230:383:547:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:II. The Real Estate Boom 
9:199:14998:36:21:96:543:511:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Since its housing reforms in the 1990s, China has experienced a spectacular real estate boom 
9:200:15091:21:29:72:333:490:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that is still ongoing. This section discusses this boom. 
9:201:15148:29:28:72:154:461:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Housing prices  
9:202:15164:28:21:96:543:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:One  cannot  simply  use  prices  from  housing  transactions  from  one  month  to  another  to 
9:203:15261:21:21:72:543:412:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compute housing-price appreciation in a city because housing units transacted in two separate 
9:204:15355:21:20:72:542:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:months  are  likely  different  and thus  have  different  qualities. This  feature  makes  housing 
9:205:15455:20:21:72:543:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transactions different from trading of typical financial securities. As a result, it is important to 
9:206:15556:21:21:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:construct  a  housing  price  index that  adjusts  for  potential  quality  heterogeneity  in  transacted 
9:207:15662:21:21:72:542:329:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing units. There are two commonly used approaches to construct such housing price indices. 
9:208:15757:21:20:72:542:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:One is the hedonic price regression approach, initially proposed by Kain and Quigley (1970), 
9:209:15850:20:21:72:542:288:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which regresses the prices of all housing transactions that occurred at different times in a given 
9:210:15949:21:42:72:457:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:city on all measurable characteristics of the transacted housing units as follows:

9:216:16171:22:20:72:542:161:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transacted  housing  unit,  such  as  distance  to  city  center,  area amenities,  availability  of  public 
9:217:16280:20:22:72:542:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:transportation,  size  of  the  unit,  etc.  After  accounting  for  the  price  effects  of  housing  quality 
9:218:16391:22:20:72:543:119:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:captured  by  these  measurable  characteristics,  the  time-effect  coefficients ሼߚ௧ሽ௧ୀ଴் provide  a 
9:219:16493:20:21:71:543:99:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing price index of the city. A key challenge to this approach is that failure to include all 
9:220:16590:21:0:71:543:78:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relevant housing characteristics, some of which may be unobservable, may lead to a biased price 
10:221:16689:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:index. This challenge is particularly severe in China’s nascent housing market as the urbanization 
10:222:16788:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:process has led to dramatic expansions of cities, making it extremely difficult to reliably measure 
10:223:16888:21:29:72:158:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing quality.   
10:224:16907:29:20:96:543:638:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In response to the challenges with the hedonic price regression approach, economists, e.g., 
10:225:16999:20:21:72:543:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Case and Shiller (1987), have developed a second approach based on repeated sales of the same 
10:226:17093:21:21:72:543:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing unit. As repeated sales share the same housing quality, this approach does not require any 
10:227:17192:21:20:72:542:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:direct measure of housing quality. A potential weakness of this approach is that it requires a 
10:228:17287:20:21:72:546:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sufficient number of repeated housing transactions, which is again difficult for many Chinese cities, 
10:229:17389:21:29:72:541:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as repeated housing sales usually become more frequent only after the housing market matures.    
10:230:17486:29:21:96:543:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In a recent study, Fang et al. (2016) develop a hybrid approach to account for the unique 
10:231:17576:21:20:72:542:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:setting of China’s nascent housing market. Specifically, they use housing transactions within the 
10:232:17674:20:21:72:542:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:same  housing  communities.  It  has  been  common  during  China’s  urbanization  process  for  a 
10:233:17773:21:21:72:543:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:developer to build up a community with hundreds of apartment units in a number of high-rise 
10:234:17865:21:20:72:543:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:buildings and then gradually sell these apartments over 1 to 2 years. These apartments share the 
10:235:17962:20:21:72:542:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:same  community  amenities,  which  are  usually  difficult  to  measure,  and  differ  only  in  their 
10:236:18066:21:21:72:542:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics inside the community, such as size, number of rooms, floor level, and orientation, 
10:237:18165:21:20:72:542:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which are relatively easy to measure. Based on this observation, Fang et al. (2016) construct a 
10:238:18261:20:21:72:543:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing price index for 120 cities in China by modifying the standard hedonic regression approach 
10:239:18359:21:21:72:542:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to  include  a  community  fixed  effect,  which  controls  for  the  community-level  heterogeneity, 
10:240:18461:21:42:72:369:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:together with a number of within-community characteristics:

10:248:18866:21:21:72:543:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regression by using a detailed mortgage data set from a major commercial bank for 120 Chinese 
10:249:18960:21:20:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities from 2003 to 2013, and create a housing price index for each of these cities. A recent study 
10:250:19060:20:21:72:542:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:by Chen et al. (2018b) uses a similar approach and a mortgage loan sample from a different major 
10:251:19157:21:0:72:459:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:commercial bank to create a set of housing price indices for 70 cities after 2011. 
11:252:19243:0:20:96:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) publishes housing price indices for 70 major cities. 
11:253:19336:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Before 2011, the NBS 70-city price indices show only small price appreciations across China, in 
11:254:19432:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contrast to casual observations about housing transaction prices in these cities.2 After 2011, the 
11:255:19531:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:NBS  adopted  a  new  housing  price  construction  approach,  which  adjusts  for  housing  quality 
11:256:19632:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:according to document released on the NBS website. Interestingly, Chen et al. (2018b) confirm 
11:257:19726:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that after 2011 the NBS 70-city index has become more reasonable in reflecting housing price 
11:258:19819:21:21:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fluctuations. To discuss China’s housing boom, this chapter uses the housing price indices of Fang 
11:259:19918:21:20:72:543:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:et al. (2016) to cover the period of 2003–2012 and use the NBS 70-city index to cover the later 
11:260:20014:20:281:72:185:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period of 2013–2017.

11:268:20423:8:16:72:542:102:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2 By comparing their price indices with the NBS 70-city price indices, Fang et al. (2016) find that the NBS 70-city 
11:269:20539:16:0:72:521:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:housing price indices display substantial smaller price appreciations than theirs during the period of 2003-2013. 
12:270:20657:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of households’ purchasing power: per capita gross regional product (GRP), which is available up 
12:271:20753:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to 2016. The vertical line in the plot marks January 2013 that separates the two samples, with the 
12:272:20852:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing price index from Fang et al. (2016) for the earlier period and the NBS 70-city index for 
12:273:20949:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the later period. The national housing price index level appreciated tremendously, reaching in 2017 
12:274:21049:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a level about 4.5 times of its 2003 level. Interestingly, this tremendous housing price appreciation 
12:275:21150:21:37:72:398:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was nonetheless accompanied by similar growth in per capita GRP.

12:283:21567:21:21:72:542:106:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. In Panel A, the housing price index of Beijing 
12:284:21658:21:0:72:543:85:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experienced an enormous increase from an index level of 1 in 2003 to over 11 in 2017, an eleven 
13:285:21758:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fold increase in just 14 years. This increase is also substantially greater than the increase in per 
13:286:21859:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capita GRP of the city, which was about fourfold. As seen in Panel B, the housing price index of 
13:287:21956:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Shanghai registered a more modest, but nevertheless enormous, increase of 6 times of the initial 
13:288:22053:21:28:72:202:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:level in the same period.    
13:289:22082:28:21:96:542:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Panels C and D display the housing price indices for Guangzhou and Shenzhen, which are 
13:290:22169:21:21:72:542:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:both  located  in  the  Pearl  River  Delta  of  Guangdong  province,  one  of  the  most  vibrant 
13:291:22268:21:20:72:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:manufacturing centers in the world. These two cities had similar housing price fluctuations in 
13:292:22363:20:21:72:543:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2003–2017.  While  the  overall  price  appreciation  in  this  period is  remarkable,  both  cities 
13:293:22464:21:21:72:542:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experienced  multiple  episodes  of  price  adjustment,  with  the  most-severe  price  adjustment 
13:294:22563:21:21:72:542:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:occurring in 2007–2008. The 2008 world financial crisis had a great impact on the export industries 
13:295:22663:21:20:72:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in this region, and both cities suffered substantial housing price drops in this period, with the 
13:296:22761:20:29:72:376:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing price index of Shenzhen dropping by more than 30%.  
13:297:22821:29:21:96:542:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Figure 5 also shows remarkable price increases across the four first-tier cities in 2015–2016, 
13:298:22916:21:20:71:543:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with the housing prices in Shenzhen almost doubled, before the prices in these cities stabilized at 
13:299:23016:20:37:71:547:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their new levels in 2017 as a result of the government’s effort to temper any further increases.

14:306:23454:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities in Panels A and B, respectively. Panel A shows that the second-tier cities, which are typically 
14:307:23557:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provincial capitals and important commercial centers, had an enormous housing price appreciation 
14:308:23654:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of 400% from 2003 to 2017. This price appreciation while more modest than that of the first-tier 
14:309:23751:20:21:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities, is spectacular by any standard. Even more impressively, it was accompanied by neck-in-
14:310:23845:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:neck growth in the per capita GRP. Panel B shows that the third-tier cities, which are usually 
14:311:23940:21:21:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regional industrial or commercial centers, had a price appreciation of over 200% in the same 
14:312:24033:21:20:72:542:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period.3  While this price appreciation is impressive, it actually lagged behind the growth of per 
14:313:24132:20:29:72:201:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capita GRP in these cities. 
14:314:24160:29:21:96:542:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In sum, housing prices across China experienced tremendous appreciation from 2003 through 
14:315:24250:21:20:72:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2017. These enormous price appreciations were accompanied by equally impressive growth in per 
14:316:24344:20:29:72:295:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capital GRP, except in a few first-tier cities.    
14:317:24395:29:29:72:210:444:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Is there a housing bubble? 
14:318:24422:29:20:96:543:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The world financial crisis in 2008 was originated from the crash of the U.S. housing market. 
14:319:24515:20:21:72:542:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Interestingly, from 1996 to its housing market peak in 2006, the national housing price index in 
14:320:24612:21:21:72:542:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the U.S., as measured by the Case-Shiller U.S. housing price index, grew by about 100%. In 
14:321:24703:21:20:72:543:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contrast, the national housing price index in China appreciated by about 250% from 2003 through 
14:322:24799:20:21:72:543:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2013, and further appreciated after 2013. This tremendous housing price appreciation across China 
14:323:24897:21:21:72:542:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:has led to a widely held concern that there might be a housing bubble in China, e.g., Wu, Gyouko, 
14:324:24995:21:29:72:521:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Deng (2016), Chen and Wen (2017), Glaeser et al. (2017), and Song and Xiong (2018).   
14:325:25085:29:20:96:543:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This  is  a  challenging  issue  due  to  the  well-known  difficulty  of  reliably  measuring  the 
14:326:25185:20:21:72:543:242:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fundamentals of a housing market, which are determined by complex dynamics of both supply and 
14:327:25279:21:21:72:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:demand of housing in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. The rapid economic growth and 
14:328:25370:21:20:72:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:urbanization  process  in  China  make  assessment  of  its  housing  fundamentals  even  more 
14:329:25465:20:21:72:542:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:challenging. To confront this challenge, Han, Han, and Zhu (2018) develop a dynamic rational 
14:330:25558:21:21:72:543:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expectations general equilibrium model to quantify the fundamentals of Beijing’s housing market. 
14:331:25655:21:28:72:543:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Based on the balanced growth path of the model and using Hong Kong as a reference city, their

14:333:25809:8:16:72:542:102:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:3 Note that Panel B builds on two samples of third-tier cities. The sample before 2013 includes 85 third-tier cities from 
14:334:25931:16:0:71:540:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Fang et al. (2016), while the sample after 2013 includes the third-tier cities in the NBS 70-city housing price index.   
15:335:26056:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:analysis shows that the fundamentals are 30% lower than the observed market prices, suggesting 
15:336:26151:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the presence of a potential housing bubble. Despite its rigor, their model nevertheless has to ignore 
15:337:26253:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:potentially important features, such as migration and housing demand from non-residents, which 
15:338:26348:21:28:72:480:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:play particularly important roles in the housing market of first-tier cities in China.     
15:339:26439:28:21:96:543:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The  fact  that  the  enormous  housing  boom  across  China  was  accompanied  by  similarly 
15:340:26533:21:21:72:544:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impressive growth in household purchasing power at the national level shows that this is not a 
15:341:26628:21:20:72:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:boom without any fundamental support. As argued by Fang et al. (2016), this is also in contrast to 
15:342:26727:20:21:72:543:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the housing boom and bust cycles experienced by Japan in the early 1990s and Singapore in the 
15:343:26821:21:21:72:543:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:late 1990s, which both witnessed housing price appreciations substantially greater than household 
15:344:26919:21:29:72:167:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:purchasing power.  
15:345:26938:29:20:96:543:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The recent U.S. housing crash directly damaged the U.S. financial system through heavy 
15:346:27025:20:21:72:545:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mortgage defaults, due to insufficient down payments required by banks during the boom years.  
15:347:27120:21:21:72:543:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As we will discuss in the next section, it is reassuring that banks in China have imposed strict down 
15:348:27222:21:20:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payment requirements of over 30% on all mortgage loans, which protect banks against a sizable 
15:349:27316:20:21:72:543:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing market meltdown of 30%. However, as we will also discuss, a key worry is that many 
15:350:27407:21:21:72:543:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households across China, especially low-income households, have taken on substantial financial 
15:351:27502:21:20:72:543:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:burdens to buy homes at 8 to 10 times their annual incomes. Their buying decisions cannot be 
15:352:27595:20:21:72:542:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:explained by simple consumption motives, and instead build on expectations of high income 
15:353:27685:21:21:72:543:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growth being persistent into the future. Such expectations make the housing market particularly 
15:354:27781:21:21:72:543:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vulnerable to a sudden economic slowdown in China, which could lead to dramatic corrections in 
15:355:27876:21:28:72:489:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:household expectations about future income growth and housing price appreciation.     
15:356:27962:28:29:72:136:250:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Land prices 
15:357:27974:29:21:96:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Land is a crucial input in housing development. In many other countries, such as the United 
15:358:28066:21:20:72:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States,  land  supply  for  housing  in  a  city  is  determined  by  the landscape  and  local  zoning 
15:359:28170:20:21:72:543:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:restrictions.  In  contrast,  land  supply  in  Chinese  cities  is  determined  by  land  sales  of  local 
15:360:28278:21:21:72:543:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments, as land is legally owned by the State and controlled by local governments. For a 
15:361:28372:21:20:72:543:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:long time after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, land transactions were 
15:362:28472:20:21:72:543:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prohibited. An important milestone occurred in 1988 when China amended its constitution to allow 
15:363:28569:21:0:72:542:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land transactions, which set the legal stage for privatization of housing. However, strictly speaking, 
16:364:28676:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the object of a land transaction is the “land usage right” of a land parcel for a period of time rather 
16:365:28780:20:29:72:169:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than its ownership.  
16:366:28801:29:21:96:542:659:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China has rigid zoning restrictions to classify different land parcels for different uses, with 
16:367:28897:21:20:72:543:638:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industrial land for building industrial and manufacturing facilities, residential land for residential 
16:368:29000:20:21:72:543:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:properties, and commercial land for commercial and business facilities. Under the current land 
16:369:29095:21:21:72:543:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:law, industrial land can be leased for a term of 30 years, commercial land for 40 years, and 
16:370:29188:21:20:71:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residential land for 70 years. It is commonly presumed by the public that after a lease period 
16:371:29283:20:21:71:542:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expires, the property owner would be able to renew its land lease, possibly at a fee, although land 
16:372:29383:21:29:71:409:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:renewal and the renewal fee are not formally stated by the land law.    
16:373:29455:29:21:95:543:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Similar to housing transactions, heterogeneity in land quality makes it difficult to compare 
16:374:29548:21:20:71:542:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prices in different land transactions. A recent study by Chen et al. (2018a) uses the standard 
16:375:29643:20:21:71:543:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hedonic price regression approach to construct a set of land price indices for 284 Chinese cities, 
16:376:29742:21:21:71:542:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:based on information released by the Ministry of Land and Resources on all land transactions in 
16:377:29838:21:20:71:543:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these cities between 2004 and 2015. Their land price indices separate industrial, commercial, and 
16:378:29936:20:29:71:220:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residential land in each city.4   
16:379:29970:29:21:96:543:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Figure 7 depicts the national land price indices for industrial land, commercial land, and 
16:380:30061:21:20:72:542:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residential land, which are weighted averages of the city level land price indices across the 284 
16:381:30159:20:21:72:543:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities used in Chen et al. (2018a). The plot shows that commercial land experienced enormous 
16:382:30252:21:21:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price appreciation, from a level of 1 in 2004 to over a level of 6.11 in 2015. Residential land had 
16:383:30352:21:21:72:543:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a more moderate, yet nevertheless dramatic appreciation, from a level of 1 to a level of about 4.75 
16:384:30452:21:20:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:over the same period. In contrast to the substantial price appreciation of residential and commercial 
16:385:30554:20:21:72:542:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land, the price of industrial land remained almost flat, from a level of 1 in 2004 to a level of about 
16:386:30657:21:21:72:542:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1.5 in 2015. It is a common practice for local governments throughout China to offer industrial 
16:387:30753:21:20:72:543:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land at subsidized prices to support local industries. As industrial enterprises can often obtain 
16:388:30851:20:21:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industrial land at low cost to start or expand their operations in a city, industrial land did not 
16:389:30950:21:69:72:431:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experience as much price appreciation as commercial and residential land.

17:395:31269:37:21:96:542:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As we will discuss in Section IV, the revenue from land sales is an important source of local 
17:396:31363:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments’ fiscal budgets. To the extent that local governments are local monopolies of land 
17:397:31458:21:21:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:supply  and  heavily  rely  on  land  sale  revenues  for  their  own  fiscal  budgets,  the  markets  for 
17:398:31565:21:20:72:543:356:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residential  properties  and  commercial  real  estate  are  crucially  tied  to  land  sale  policies  and 
17:399:31673:20:37:72:490:336:144:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:strategies of local governments. This is a special feature of China’s real estate market.  
17:400:31763:37:37:216:398:299:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:III. Real Estate and Households 
17:401:31794:37:20:96:543:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Housing is the largest item on households’ balance sheet. According to a household survey 
17:402:31884:20:21:72:543:242:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:by the China Economic Trend Research Institute, housing assets accounted for 66% of household 
17:403:31978:21:21:72:542:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:wealth  in  2016.5 Household  demand  is  also  a  key  element  in  housing  market  fundamentals, 
17:404:32078:21:20:72:542:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:motivating a strand of the academic literature to analyze the relationship between China’s housing 
17:405:32177:20:21:72:543:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:boom and household finance. Wang and Zhang (2014) show that a host of fundamental factors, 
17:406:32268:21:21:72:543:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:including the urban Hukou population, wage income, urban land supply, and construction costs, 
17:407:32362:21:28:71:542:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are unable to explain the housing price growth in Chinese cities between 2002 and 2008, which

18:411:32657:0:20:72:547:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggests the presence of other missing factors. Cao, Chen, and Zhang (2018) show that households’ 
18:412:32755:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:investment demand can be this missing factor, and it is particularly relevant for wealthy families 
18:413:32854:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with relatively loose financial constraints. Zhang (2017) argues that the marginal buyer in China’s 
18:414:32954:21:20:71:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:housing market is liquidity constrained, which in turn helps explain the substantially higher returns 
18:415:33056:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in housing as opposed to returns from capital market investments. Along a reverse direction, 
18:416:33149:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:several studies, e.g., Chamon and Prasad (2010), Wei and Zhang (2011) and Yang, Fan, and Zhao 
18:417:33243:21:21:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(2018), highlight that the housing boom also helps to explain China’s high saving rates and low 
18:418:33339:21:28:72:140:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consumption. 
18:419:33352:28:21:96:543:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In this section, we discuss the financial burdens faced by households, especially low-income 
18:420:33445:21:21:72:542:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households, in buying homes. Specifically, we want to understand whether housing has been out 
18:421:33539:21:20:72:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of  reach  for  typical  households  in  China,  which  worries  many  commentators,  and  whether 
18:422:33638:20:21:72:542:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households purchase housing for pure consumption purposes. Understanding these issues help to 
18:423:33732:21:29:72:422:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dissect the risks in China’s real estate market from the household side.    
18:424:33808:29:20:96:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fang et al. (2016) analyze a sample of mortgage loans issued by a major commercial bank 
18:425:33896:20:21:72:543:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across 120 Chinese cities in 2003–2013. While wealthy households may not need mortgage loans 
18:426:33989:21:21:72:543:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to  purchase  homes,  mortgages  are  necessary  for  many  households,  especially  low-income 
18:427:34085:21:20:72:542:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households. In this section, we discuss several important observations uncovered by their study 
18:428:34181:20:29:72:313:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:about home purchases of mortgage borrowers.      
18:429:34230:29:29:72:156:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Down payment  
18:430:34244:29:21:96:543:283:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Down payments are an important buffer that protects banks against the potential default risks 
18:431:34338:21:20:72:543:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of mortgage borrowers in the event of a future housing market meltdown. The analysis of Fang et 
18:432:34434:20:21:71:542:242:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:al. (2016) shows that down payments in their mortgage sample had been consistently above 30% 
18:433:34527:21:21:72:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across first-, second-, and third-tier cities. Interestingly, they find that the average down payment 
18:434:34629:21:20:72:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ratio  of  mortgage  loans  made  to  the  group  with  income  in  the  lowest  10%  of  all  mortgage 
18:435:34733:20:21:72:543:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:borrowers was even slightly higher than that of the group with income in the middle quintile of all 
18:436:34833:21:29:72:193:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mortgage borrowers.       
18:437:34859:29:20:96:542:130:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:These high down payment levels are consistent with the strict mortgage policies imposed by 
18:438:34950:20:21:72:542:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the PBC on banks: one housing unit cannot be used as collateral for more than one mortgage loan. 
18:439:35047:21:0:72:543:89:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:More importantly, mortgage policies require a minimum down payment of 30% on first mortgages. 
19:440:35145:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This minimum down payment requirement had changed over time from between 30% and 40%. 
19:441:35231:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The adjustment of the minimum down payment ratio has even become a powerful instrument for 
19:442:35322:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the central government to intervene in the housing market. Down payments on mortgages used to 
19:443:35416:21:28:71:270:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:purchase second homes are even higher.  
19:444:35456:28:21:95:543:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The high mortgage down payment levels in China are in sharp contrast to the popular use of 
19:445:35547:21:21:71:543:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:zero down payment loans and negative amortization loans during the U.S. housing bubble of 
19:446:35637:21:20:71:542:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2000s,6 and  mitigate  the  risk  of  mortgage  defaults  in  the  event  of  a  future  housing  market 
19:447:35742:20:21:71:542:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meltdown. Furthermore, mortgage loans in China are all recourse loans, which allow lenders to 
19:448:35836:21:21:71:542:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:collect  a  borrower’s  other  assets  in  the  event  of  a  mortgage  default.  These  institutional 
19:449:35939:21:29:71:469:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:arrangements make a U.S.-style subprime credit crisis less of a concern for China. 
19:450:36022:29:28:71:233:485:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Income of mortgage borrowers 
19:451:36051:28:21:95:542:457:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fang et al. (2016) provide a detailed account of household income of mortgage borrowers in 
19:452:36142:21:21:71:543:436:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the bottom 10% and middle 10% of all mortgage borrowers in each year between 2003 and 2013 
19:453:36233:21:20:71:542:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and across first-, second-, and third-tier cities in their sample. They find steady growth in the 
19:454:36331:20:21:71:542:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:household income of these two groups of mortgage borrowers, consistent with the rapidly rising 
19:455:36426:21:21:71:542:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:household income during this period in China. More interestingly, they also map the average 
19:456:36518:21:21:71:542:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income  of  the  bottom-income  group  of  mortgage  borrowers  into  the  income  distribution 
19:457:36614:21:20:71:543:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constructed by the Urban Household Survey, which is available for all first- and second-tier cities. 
19:458:36715:20:21:71:540:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:They find that despite rapid housing price appreciation across China, the position of the bottom-
19:459:36812:21:21:71:543:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income group of mortgage borrowers in the income distribution of city residents remained below 
19:460:36907:21:20:71:542:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the 35th percentile in first-tier cities and below the 40th percentile in second-tier cities throughout 
19:461:37011:20:21:72:539:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2003–2013. This suggests that the rapidly growing prices did not exclude households in the low-
19:462:37106:21:29:72:338:229:144:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:income fraction of the population from buying homes.

19:465:37263:9:16:72:542:139:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:6 According to Mayer, Pence, and Sherlund (2009), during the U.S. housing bubble period of 2003–2006, households 
19:466:37376:16:12:72:542:123:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:with poor credit (the subprime and Alt-A households) had commonly secured mortgages with a 5% or zero down 
19:467:37483:12:13:72:542:111:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:payments to finance their home purchases. Some mortgages even allowed the borrowers to have negative amortization 
19:468:37597:13:12:72:542:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:over time. When U.S. housing prices started to decline after 2006, these borrowers were more likely to default on their 
19:469:37717:12:0:72:305:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:mortgage loans, exacerbating the housing market decline. 
20:470:37778:0:20:96:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Price-to-income ratio provides a convenient measure of the financial burdens endured by a 
20:471:37868:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:household in acquiring a home. Figure 8 depicts the price-to-income ratio of mortgage borrowers 
20:472:37964:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in  the  bottom-income  and  middle-income  subsamples  from  Fang  et al.  (2016).  The  financial 
20:473:38064:21:20:72:540:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:burdens faced by the bottom-income group are particularly relevant. In this group, the price-to-
20:474:38160:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income ratio started at a level slightly above 8 across the three tiers of cities in 2003. In first-tier 
20:475:38265:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities, this ratio remained at around 8 before 2008 and then climbed to a peak of 10.7 in 2011 
20:476:38360:21:21:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:before dropping back to 9.2 in 2012. In second- and third-tier cities, this ratio was very similar and 
20:477:38463:21:20:72:543:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:remained in a tight range around 8. It had a modest decline from a level slightly above 8 in 2003 
20:478:38561:20:21:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to 7.2 in 2007 and then climbed back to a peak slightly below 9 in 2011 before dropping back to 
20:479:38657:21:224:72:189:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:around 8 again in 2012.

20:483:38767:37:21:96:543:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The price-to-income ratio for the middle-income group was consistently lower than that for 
20:484:38858:21:20:72:543:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the bottom-income group. It was highest in the first-tier cities and lowest in the third-tier cities. 
20:485:38960:20:21:72:543:183:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Across the three tiers of cities, it had a similar pattern over time. In first-tier cities, it expanded 
20:486:39064:21:21:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from 5.6 in 2003 to 8.3 in 2011 before dropping back to 7.5 in 2012. In second-tier cities, it 
20:487:39159:21:20:72:543:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expanded from 5.7 in 2003 to 7.4 in 2010 before dropping back to 6.2 in 2012. In third-tier cities, 
20:488:39259:20:0:72:462:121:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:it expanded from 5.0 in 2003 to 6.4 in 2010 before dropping back to 6.2 in 2012. 
21:489:39344:0:20:96:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:While the housing price appreciations in China are generally compatible with household 
21:490:39431:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income growth, Figure 8 shows that home buyers endure substantial financial burdens in buying 
21:491:39525:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:homes. To clearly understand the financial burdens, let us consider a household that buys a home 
21:492:39622:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:at eight times its annual income. A typical down payment of 40% implies that the household needs 
21:493:39719:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to save 3.2 years of its income before buying the home. In China, it is common for parents to pay 
21:494:39817:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the down payment for a young couple. In addition, the household needs a mortgage loan of 4.8 
21:495:39910:21:21:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:times of its income. Even if the loan comes with a modest interest rate of 6% and a long maturity 
21:496:40008:21:20:72:543:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of 30 years, each year the household would spend nearly 44.8% of its annual income to service the 
21:497:40106:20:21:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mortgage, including 28.8% to cover the interest payment and another 16% to pay down the loan 
21:498:40199:21:29:72:244:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:at a linear schedule over 30 years.   
21:499:40237:29:20:96:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consumption motives cannot explain the willingness of these households to endure such 
21:500:40323:20:21:72:542:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financial burdens of buying homes. According to the data provided by the Housing Big Data 
21:501:40413:21:21:72:542:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Research Program of China’s Social Science Academy, the annual rental yields of housing in 
21:502:40504:21:20:72:543:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Beijing and Shanghai were only 1.85% and 2.51% in July 2018,7 which are even below the yield 
21:503:40597:20:21:72:543:411:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of China’s one-year Treasury bonds. In other words, renting homes is substantially cheaper than 
21:504:40693:21:29:72:149:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:buying homes.  
21:505:40708:29:20:96:543:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:What  makes  those  bottom-income  mortgage  borrowers  willing  to  endure  the  enormous 
21:506:40799:20:21:72:542:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financial  burdens?  Several  factors  may  help  explain  their  willingness.  First,  China  has  a 
21:507:40901:21:21:72:543:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantially higher saving rate relative to developed countries. According to data released by 
21:508:40997:21:21:72:543:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the ratio of aggregate savings by households and firms 
21:509:41091:21:20:72:542:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relative to the national GDP was around 35% in the 1980s and gradually grew to over 50% in the 
21:510:41186:20:21:72:542:258:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2000s. Second, China’s relatively underdeveloped financial markets offer few investment assets 
21:511:41281:21:21:72:543:237:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for households and firms to invest their savings. The stringent capital controls imposed by the 
21:512:41377:21:20:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:central government also prevent them from investing their savings in global financial markets. As 
21:513:41475:20:21:71:543:196:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a result, housing is often used as an investment asset, not just a consumption good. Third, to make 
21:514:41575:21:21:71:542:175:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:matters worse, the largely unbalanced gender ratio between boys and girls in China means that 
21:515:41669:21:56:71:545:154:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:boys  face  substantial  competition  in  the  marriage  market.  As  home ownership serves as an

22:518:41932:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:important status symbol, the competition in the marriage market adds to demand for housing, as 
22:519:42027:20:29:72:266:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:argued by Wei, Zhang, and Liu (2012).  
22:520:42066:29:29:72:224:659:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Housing market expectations 
22:521:42094:29:20:96:543:630:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:With  housing  as  an  investment  asset,  expectation  plays  an  important  role  in  driving 
22:522:42190:20:21:72:542:610:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:households’ willingness to pay 8–11 times their annual income to buy homes. Two compelling 
22:523:42281:21:21:72:543:589:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:forces may have led to high expectations for housing price appreciation. First, after observing 
22:524:42377:21:20:72:543:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s breakneck economic growth of 10% each year on average for 40 years, it was tempting to 
22:525:42472:20:21:72:543:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:believe that China’s economy and household income would continue to grow at a high rate, even 
22:526:42566:21:21:72:542:527:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:if not 10%, for a prolonged period. This kind of expectation would make the high housing prices 
22:527:42662:21:21:72:542:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appear more affordable. Suppose that a household expects its income to grow at an annual rate of 
22:528:42759:21:20:72:542:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:10% for 5 years. Then, its income would rise to 1.61 times the initial level, and an initial house 
22:529:42858:20:21:72:542:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price at 8 times of its annual income would fall to below 5 times its income after 5 years. Such 
22:530:42955:21:21:72:542:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:expectations  make  the  housing  market  particular  vulnerable  to  any  sudden  slowdown  of  the 
22:531:43056:21:20:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economy, which may knock down households’ growth expectations, which in turn may lead to a 
22:532:43147:20:29:72:499:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantial contraction in the price-to-income ratios that they are willing pay for homes.  
22:533:43239:29:21:96:542:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Another force also may have contributed to households’ housing expectations. Given the 
22:534:43326:21:21:72:542:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:importance of the real estate sector in China’s economy and the significant contribution of land 
22:535:43423:21:20:72:543:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sales to local governments’ fiscal budgets, a crash in the housing market would damage the macro 
22:536:43520:20:21:72:542:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economy and disable local governments. These severe consequences may have led to a perception 
22:537:43614:21:21:72:543:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that the central government would do whatever it could to avoid a housing market crash. In this 
22:538:43710:21:20:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sense, the housing market is “too important to fail” and enjoys implicit guarantees of the central 
22:539:43809:20:21:72:543:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government. In support of this perception, the central government has indeed used a broad set of 
22:540:43906:21:21:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:instruments, as summarized by Fang et al. (2016), such as mortgage interest rates, mortgage down 
22:541:44003:21:20:72:540:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payment requirements, credit policies to real estate developers, and purchase restrictions on non-
22:542:44101:20:21:72:543:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residents, to implement counter-cyclical intervention policies in the housing market. Zhu (2016) 
22:543:44198:21:21:72:542:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:argues that this perception of implicit government guarantees has strongly encouraged risk-seeking 
22:544:44297:21:37:72:235:146:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:behaviors in the housing market.  
22:545:44331:37:0:195:419:109:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:IV. Real Estate and Local Governments 
23:546:44372:0:20:96:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s local governments are deeply engaged in the real estate market. On the one hand, 
23:547:44461:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they directly control land supply. On the other hand, land sale revenues serve as an important 
23:548:44556:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:source  for  local  governments  to  fund  their  fiscal  budgets  and  local  infrastructure  projects. 
23:549:44661:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Furthermore, since the world financial crisis in 2008, local governments have commonly used the 
23:550:44757:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:LGFP to raise debt, either implicitly or explicitly by collateralizing land reserves and future land 
23:551:44858:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sale revenues. This section discusses the local governments’ strong reliance on the real estate 
23:552:44954:21:29:72:117:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market.   
23:553:44964:29:28:72:131:555:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:Land Sales 
23:554:44975:28:21:96:542:527:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Under the Chinese constitution, all land in China belongs to the State. In 1998, the 15th 
23:555:45065:21:21:72:543:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:National  Congress  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  passed  a  statutory  bill  granting  local 
23:556:45167:21:20:72:543:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments  de  jure  ownership  over  land  in  their  geographical  jurisdictions.  The  Land 
23:557:45264:20:21:72:542:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Management Law passed in 1998 also authorizes local governments to sell usufruct rights over the 
23:558:45361:21:21:72:543:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land  in  their  jurisdictions.  Land transactions  between  local  governments  and  private  buyers 
23:559:45463:21:20:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constitute the primary land market. Private buyers who obtain usufruct rights through a leasehold 
23:560:45561:20:21:72:543:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from local governments can also sell the leasehold to a third party in the secondary land market. 
23:561:45659:21:21:72:543:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:However,  compared  to  the  primary  land  market,  the  size  of  the  secondary  land  market  only 
23:562:45762:21:29:72:481:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:accounted for 3.75% of all land transactions in terms of payment from 2000 to 2015. 
23:563:45846:29:20:96:543:332:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Two fiscal reforms in the 1990s enhanced local governments’ reliance on land sale revenues: 
23:564:45938:20:21:72:542:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Tax-sharing Reform in 1994 and the Budget Law enacted in 1995. Before 1994, China’s 
23:565:46026:21:21:72:543:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:intergovernmental financial relationship could be characterized as a “fiscal contracting system.” 
23:566:46124:21:20:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In this fiscal contracting system, the central government relied on local governments as its tax 
23:567:46221:20:21:72:542:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:agencies and also gave them discretionary power over expenditures. Continuous declines of the 
23:568:46315:21:21:72:543:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:total budgetary revenue as a fraction of GDP and the central government’s share in the total 
23:569:46408:21:20:72:543:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:budgetary expenditures eventually threatened the stability of China’s macro economy. Zhu Rongji, 
23:570:46505:20:21:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the powerful Vice Premier at the time, strongly advocated the Tax-sharing Reform in 1994, which 
23:571:46601:21:29:72:461:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:steered a greater share of the total budgetary revenue to the central government.  
23:572:46684:29:20:95:542:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Figure 9 depicts the shares of subnational governments’ budgetary revenue and expenditures 
23:573:46775:20:21:72:543:118:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from 1985 to 1998. There is a remarkable drop in the share of subnational governmental revenue 
23:574:46870:21:0:72:543:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:after 1994, indicating that China’s intergovernmental fiscal system moved into a new era with the 
24:575:46972:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:central government taking a substantially greater share of the budgetary revenue. Although the 
24:576:47067:20:21:72:546:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:central  government  provides  intergovernmental  transfers  to  remedy the gap between local 
24:577:47161:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments’ revenue and expenditures, the Tax-sharing Reform  managed to extract a larger 
24:578:47252:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:portion of fiscal revenue from local governments, especially from those rich provinces. Kung, Xu, 
24:579:47350:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Zhou (2009) and Han and Kung (2015) argue that the changing fiscal incentives might have 
24:580:47443:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:caused local governments to shift their efforts from fostering industrial growth to “urbanizing” 
24:581:47540:21:275:72:433:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China, for instance, by developing the real estate and construction sector. 8

24:586:47812:37:21:96:543:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Another reason for local governments’ deep engagement in the real estate market is the 
24:587:47899:21:20:72:543:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Budget Law enacted in 1995, which prohibited local governments from running budgetary deficits 
24:588:47994:20:21:72:543:185:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:or obtaining external financing. This has been widely viewed as a critical step in confining the soft 
24:589:48096:21:21:72:543:164:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:budget constraint problem between local governments and the state-owned bank branches under 
24:590:48188:21:33:72:542:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their control. Facing these constraints, local governments managed to greatly expand their fiscal 
24:591:48286:33:8:72:218:110:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                            
24:592:48346:8:16:72:542:102:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:8 Zhang, Fan and Mo (2017) also document that local governments’ controls of residential land supply enlarged the 
24:593:48460:16:0:72:269:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:impact of productivity shocks on housing prices. 
25:594:48513:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:capacity after the late 1990s by relying on non-budgetary funding sources such as land sales. Figure 
25:595:48614:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:10 depicts the revenue from land sales from 2002 to 2015 for three tiers of cities, with Panel A 
25:596:48711:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:displaying the total land sale revenue and Panel B displaying its share in the local fiscal revenue. 
25:597:48812:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Total land sale revenue experienced rapid growth and reached a peak for the first- and second-tier 
25:598:48911:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cities in 2013. There is non-negligible heterogeneity in the share of land sale revenue in the total 
25:599:49012:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local fiscal revenue across cities, with this share particularly high for second-tier cities, which in 
25:600:49115:21:45:72:227:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:some years reached over 40%.

25:604:49300:19:37:81:533:345:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:Data Source: China Municipal Statistical Yearbook and China National Land Resource Yearbook, various years 
25:605:49407:37:21:96:543:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Tying local government budgets to revenue from land sales is a novel mechanism design. 
25:606:49494:21:20:72:542:287:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Given the initial conditions of underdevelopment across Chinese cities in the early 1990s, local 
25:607:49591:20:21:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax revenue was far from enough to fund large capital-intensive infrastructure projects and other 
25:608:49689:21:21:72:543:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local business developments. The great uncertainty also discouraged banks from funding such 
25:609:49781:21:20:72:542:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:projects, even if local governments were allowed to directly raise debt financing. On the other 
25:610:49877:20:21:72:543:205:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hand, like equity prices, land prices paid by buyers are determined not only by current business 
25:611:49974:21:21:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:conditions in a city but also their expectations of future conditions. Conditional on the fact that the 
25:612:50078:21:21:72:543:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local government is able to use its revenue from land sales to improve local infrastructure and 
25:613:50174:21:20:71:543:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:business environments, land prices can be substantially higher than what is justified by current 
25:614:50271:20:21:71:543:122:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:conditions, much like high-flying IPO prices for high-tech firms without any past earnings. As 
25:615:50366:21:21:71:543:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local governments need to regularly sell land to the public to fund their future budgets, they are 
25:616:50465:21:0:71:543:80:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incentivized  to  implement  those  promised  infrastructure  projects  and  improve  local  business 
26:617:50571:0:28:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:environments. Thus, this is an incentive-compatible design, much like staged VC financing.  
26:618:50663:28:21:96:543:680:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In addition to its function as fiscal revenue, land is also an important instrument for local 
26:619:50757:21:21:72:542:659:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments to attract prominent firms who will pursue projects in their cities and support local 
26:620:50855:21:20:72:542:638:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industrial policies. Land (especially industrial land) is often given out for free, as a land grant, or 
26:621:50959:20:21:72:542:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sold at a discount to promising firms in high-priority industries. As we discussed earlier, this is a 
26:622:51061:21:21:72:542:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:key reason that industrial land has substantial lower prices than commercial land and residential 
26:623:51159:21:20:72:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land. Local governments may also supplement the land grant with an additional tax allowance or 
26:624:51254:20:21:72:546:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:funding  support.  In  return,  local  governments  benefit  from  future tax revenues from these 
26:625:51352:21:29:72:545:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:supported firms or from an improved business environment and industry structure in their regions.  
26:626:51451:29:21:96:543:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Cheung (2008) views discounts in land sales as a main tool for local governments to compete 
26:627:51543:21:20:72:543:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for businesses. Discretion in giving such discounts can lead to both excessive competition and 
26:628:51638:20:21:72:543:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:corruption. Several studies, e.g., Cai, Henderson, and Zhang (2013), Chen and Kung (2016), Cai, 
26:629:51734:21:21:72:542:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Wang, and Zhang (2017), and Chen and Kung (2018), analyze corruption in China’s land market. 
26:630:51827:21:20:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To restrict local governments’ discretionary power in the land market, the central government 
26:631:51921:20:21:72:542:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stipulates the lowest price for industrial land and the lowest investment intensity for specific 
26:632:52018:21:21:72:543:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industries for different levels of cities and counties, generally according to their development 
26:633:52115:21:20:72:543:361:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:levels and geographic locations. To restrain corruption, in 2002 the Ministry of Land and Resource 
26:634:52214:20:21:72:542:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:issued the No. 11 regulation “Regulation on the Transaction Method of Leasehold Sale of Land by 
26:635:52310:21:21:72:543:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Local Government,” which requires leasehold sales for commercial and residential developments 
26:636:52404:21:21:72:542:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to use open auctions. As a result of this regulation, the proportion of land transactions using open 
26:637:52505:21:20:72:543:278:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:auctions, instead of case-by-case negotiations, rose from less than 20% in 2000 to over 90% in 
26:638:52600:20:29:72:109:258:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2012.9  
26:639:52608:29:21:96:542:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Finally, land sales by local governments are subject to a restrictive national quota constraint,

26:641:52801:20:21:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:discipline local governments’ short-term incentives to overdevelop local real estate markets. The 
26:642:52899:21:21:72:542:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:central  government  allocates  the  national  quota  across  different  regions,  based  on  its 
26:643:52997:21:20:72:542:146:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:macroeconomic  policies  and  national  development  strategy.  In  recent  years,  China’s  Great 
26:644:53096:20:28:72:543:126:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Western Development Strategy has tilted more of the quota to central and western provinces, at

27:647:53369:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the expense of eastern provinces. Liang, Lu, and Zhang (2016) show that this shift in land supply 
27:648:53467:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:raised  housing  prices  and  wages  in  eastern  provinces,  which  in turn  distorted  the  spatial 
27:649:53569:21:29:72:282:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:distribution of China’s economic activities.

27:651:53637:28:21:96:543:610:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Land and future land sale revenues also serve as key collaterals for local governments to raise 
27:652:53733:21:21:72:542:589:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:debt financing. As we discussed before, China’s Budget Law prohibited local governments from 
27:653:53826:21:20:72:543:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:seeking  debt  financing.  Bai,  Hsieh,  and  Song  (2016)  provide  a  detailed  account  of  how  this 
27:654:53931:20:21:72:543:548:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regulatory arrangement was changed in 2008. To back stop the potential spillover effects of the 
27:655:54027:21:21:72:543:527:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:world financial crisis on China’s export-driven economy, in 2008, China launched a massive fiscal 
27:656:54125:21:21:72:543:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stimulus program on the magnitude of 4 trillion RMB, equivalent to 12.5% of China’s GDP. This 
27:657:54219:21:20:72:543:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stimulus program involved mostly infrastructure projects, which local governments implemented 
27:658:54313:20:21:72:543:465:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and financed. It was infeasible for local governments to fund this massive program through regular 
27:659:54412:21:21:72:542:444:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax revenue or land sales in a short time period. Instead, the central government allowed local 
27:660:54508:21:28:72:309:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments to create the LGFP to raise debt.10   
27:661:54558:28:21:96:543:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Another chapter in this handbook by Zhang and Xiong (2018) provides a detailed account of 
27:662:54648:21:21:72:542:374:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  arrangement  of  LGFP.  Briefly  speaking,  in  a  typical  arrangement  to  support  a  certain 
27:663:54750:21:20:72:543:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:infrastructure project, a local government creates an LGFP and injects land reserves or future land 
27:664:54850:20:21:72:543:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sale revenues as capital into the LGFP, which in turn can apply for bank loans. In most cases, the 
27:665:54949:21:21:72:543:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:LGFP  also  carries  either  explicit  or  implicit  guarantees  from  the  local  government.  These 
27:666:55051:21:21:72:543:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:guarantees further mitigate any concern about credit risk. Local governments commonly use this 
27:667:55146:21:20:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:arrangement at all administrative levels; this led to tremendous growth in debt taken on by local 
27:668:55244:20:29:72:195:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:governments after 2008.  
27:669:55269:29:21:96:542:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s National Audit Office conducted a comprehensive audit of all local government debts 
27:670:55361:21:20:72:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:at the end of June 2013. According to this audit, the total volume of outstanding local government 
27:671:55460:20:21:72:542:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:debt reached 10.89 trillion RMB, equivalent to 19.2% of China’s national GDP in 2013. Among 
27:672:55552:21:36:72:542:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these debts, 37.23% used future land sale revenue as collateral. Figure 11 provides the distribution

27:674:55713:9:16:72:542:114:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:10 Regarding debt financing by LGFP, Ang, Bai, and Zhou (2016) find that real estate GDP is the most important 
27:675:55824:16:12:71:542:98:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:determinant of the cross-section of excess yields of Chengtou bonds (i.e., bonds issued by LGFP to finance local 
27:676:55937:12:0:71:170:86:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:infrastructure projects).  
28:677:55968:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of local government debt across several dimensions. LGFP are the most important vehicles for 
28:678:56061:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local governments to raise debt, and governments have explicit obligations to pay 61% of the debts. 
28:679:56161:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Furthermore, bank loans were an important source of outstanding local government debt in 2013, 
28:680:56256:21:182:72:437:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and city construction is the most important purpose for raising the debts.

28:685:56439:43:21:96:543:175:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:While LGFP helped to successfully implement the post-crisis stimulus program and fund 
28:686:56525:21:21:71:542:154:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:many important infrastructure projects, their popularity has led to undesirable impacts on the 
28:687:56620:21:21:71:542:133:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financial  system.  Bai,  Hsieh,  and  Song  (2016)  argue  that  the  LGPF  arrangement  reversed 
28:688:56719:21:20:71:543:112:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:important  progress  made  by  China’s  previous  economic  reform  to constrain  the  soft  budget 
28:689:56819:20:0:71:543:92:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constraint  problem  of  local  governments.  Furthermore,  when  the central  government  later 
29:690:56920:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tightened monetary policy to limit debt accumulation by local governments, LGFP had trouble 
29:691:57012:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rolling over their bank loans. Instead, this trouble pushed most LGFP debt financing into the 
29:692:57106:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shadow banking system with higher borrowing costs and less transparency. Consistent with this 
29:693:57200:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:migration of local government debt into the shadow system, Chen, He, and Liu (2017) find that 
29:694:57294:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provinces with an abnormally higher increase of bank loan growth in 2009 experienced more 
29:695:57384:21:37:72:294:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:shadow banking activities during 2012–2015.

29:697:57452:36:21:96:543:532:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Firms in China are also heavily exposed to risks of the real estate market. There are at least 
29:698:57547:21:21:72:543:511:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:two key channels that expose firms to the real estate market. First, real estate assets are the most 
29:699:57648:21:21:72:542:490:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:widely used collateral for firms to borrow from banks. As shown by Figure 1, banks have 22.2 
29:700:57741:21:20:72:543:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trillion in outstanding loans with real estate as collateral, including loans to firms. Through this 
29:701:57842:20:21:72:543:449:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:collateral channel, as modeled by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), fluctuations in land price affect 
29:702:57937:21:21:72:542:428:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:bank credit available to firms, which may in turn affect firm investment. Gan (2007) and Chaney, 
29:703:58034:21:20:72:542:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Sraer,  and Thesmar  (2012)  provide  evidence of  this  effect  of  land  price  fluctuations  on  firm 
29:704:58139:20:21:72:543:387:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:investment in Japan and the United States, respectively. There are also several recent studies of 
29:705:58237:21:21:72:543:366:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this effect in China. Wu, Gyourko, and Deng (2015) use a unique firm data set in 35 Chinese cities 
29:706:58336:21:20:72:543:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in 2003–2011 but find no evidence of increases in firm investment in response to land price 
29:707:58428:20:21:72:539:325:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increases. Chen et al. (2018a) employ a larger sample of firms in 284 prefectural cities in 2000–
29:708:58525:21:29:72:272:304:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2015 and find some supportive evidence. 
29:709:58565:29:21:96:543:275:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:There  is  also  another  speculative  channel  through  which  firms  actively  seek  real  estate 
29:710:58665:21:20:72:542:254:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exposure during China’s ongoing real estate boom. To discuss the speculative channel, we build 
29:711:58760:20:21:72:540:234:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on a recent study by Chen et al. (2018a), which analyzes the investment of a sample of non-
29:712:58851:21:21:72:543:213:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financial and non-real estate firms publicly listed in China’s A-share market. Figure 12 depicts the 
29:713:58952:21:20:72:543:192:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:average investment of these firms in each year between 2000 and 2015. The annual investment is 
29:714:59047:20:21:72:542:172:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:further decomposed into four components from top to bottom: investment unrelated to land and 
29:715:59140:21:21:72:543:151:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:investments  to  acquire  residential  land,  commercial  land,  and  industrial  land.  Firms’  annual 
29:716:59244:21:20:72:543:130:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:investment rapidly rose from about 100 million RMB in 2000 to the peak of nearly 1,500 million 
29:717:59339:20:21:72:543:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:RMB in 2011, before dropping to around 1,200 million RMB in more recent years. While these 
29:718:59430:21:0:72:542:89:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms did not spend anything on land before 2007, they quickly expanded their land investments 
30:719:59529:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:after 2007. At the peak years of 2010 and 2011, a firm spent on average around 500 million RMB 
30:720:59624:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on  acquiring  land;  this  was  mostly  commercial  land  rather  than industrial  land.  In  2010, 
30:721:59725:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:commercial land accounted for more than 30% of the firms’ net investment. While the amount and 
30:722:59820:21:20:72:540:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the share of land investment dropped after 2011, they nevertheless remained substantial in 2012–

30:729:60206:20:21:72:542:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:residential land represents a form of real estate speculation, induced by the higher capital returns 
30:730:60307:21:21:72:542:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from land price appreciation than from the real economy during the real estate boom. Through a 
30:731:60402:21:20:72:543:208:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:similar mechanism, Li and Wu (2014) and Shi (2017) argue that the real estate boom in China

31:738:61014:20:21:71:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financing. Even more special in China, local governments control land supply through regular land 
31:739:61112:21:21:71:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sales and at same time heavily rely on revenue from land sales to fund their own fiscal budgets

31:746:61778:21:21:72:543:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market on the demand side. While some households are heavily in debt, the household sector as a 
31:747:61874:21:20:72:543:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:whole has experienced rapid income growth. Second, China’s banking system is generally healthy 
31:748:61969:20:21:72:543:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and well-protected by the strictly imposed down payment requirement of over 30% on all mortgage 
31:749:62065:21:21:72:543:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:loans. Third, in the foreseeable future, China is likely to continue its capital control policies, which 
31:750:62170:21:20:72:543:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:helps  to  keep  the  accumulated  household  wealth  in  the  real  estate  market.  Finally,  concern 
31:751:62274:20:21:72:543:411:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regarding  the  impact  of  China’s  real  estate  market  on  the  sustainability  of  China’s  local 
31:752:62377:21:21:72:542:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government finance is tempered by the fact that with annual fiscal revenues of over 8 trillion yuan 
31:753:62477:21:21:72:542:369:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and land sale revenues of about 3 trillion yuan, local governments have sufficient cash flow to 
31:754:62573:21:23:72:543:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cover the interest payments of their debts. According to estimates provided by Bai et al. (2016) 
31:755:62670:23:21:71:542:325:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on 1,800 LGFP, their total assets, mostly land reserves, amount to 70 trillion yuan, which is 50% 
31:756:62768:21:20:71:543:304:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:more than their liability. It is thus unlikely that local governments in China will become illiquid or 
31:757:62871:20:29:71:494:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:insolvent in the near future, unless China experiences a dramatic land price adjustment. 
31:758:62960:29:21:95:542:255:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:That being said, we must discuss several challenges facing China’s real estate market. In the 
31:759:63054:21:20:71:543:234:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:next few years, the central government will face a tremendous challenge in using its macro policies 
31:760:63154:20:21:71:543:214:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to manage the real estate market. Glaeser et al. (2017) discuss a delicate tradeoff: on the one hand, 
31:761:63256:21:21:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Chinese government cannot afford to let the construction boom continue because more homes 
31:762:63350:21:20:71:540:172:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are being built in “wrong places” with lower, rather than higher, household income and such over-
31:763:63447:20:21:71:542:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:construction will eventually lead to a housing bust. On the other hand, the government cannot stop 
31:764:63546:21:21:71:543:131:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the  construction  boom  without  slowing  down  the  economy  and  causing  distress  to  China’s 
31:765:63645:21:21:71:543:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:employment rates. While we are not as pessimistic as Glaeser et al. (2017) about the inevitability 
31:766:63744:21:0:71:543:89:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of a housing bust in China, we are nevertheless sympathetic to the government’s macroeconomic 
32:767:63842:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:policy dilemma: how to temper the housing boom to maintain long-run stability while addressing 
32:768:63937:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the short-term pressure that would be caused to the overall economy by a slowdown of the real 
32:769:64031:21:29:72:149:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estate sector.     
32:770:64050:29:20:96:543:638:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the medium term, local governments need to find a more sustainable mechanism to fund 
32:771:64138:20:21:72:543:618:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:local fiscal budgets. One possibility is property tax levied on real estate assets as is common in 
32:772:64237:21:21:71:543:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:many developed countries. In 2011, China conducted policy trials to levy property tax on second 
32:773:64333:21:20:71:543:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:homes in Shanghai and Chongqing. The central government hesitated to expand this property tax 
32:774:64427:20:21:71:542:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:program to other cities due to resistance from homeowners as well as the fear that it might lead to 
32:775:64527:21:21:71:543:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a real estate crash and eventually threaten the stability of China’s financial system. With previously 
32:776:64630:21:21:71:542:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sold land leaseholds gradually reaching their maturities, the subsequent  land  renewal  process 
32:777:64727:21:20:71:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:provides a natural point for local governments to start collecting additional fees or taxes on real 
32:778:64827:20:281:71:161:473:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estate properties.

32:783:64989:43:21:96:542:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the long run, China’s real estate market faces a tremendous challenge from the rapid aging 
32:784:65083:21:0:72:542:80:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of  its  population.  China  started  the  “One-Child  Policy”  in  the early  1980s.  This  policy  has 
33:785:65192:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:substantially changed China’s population structure by reducing the number of children born to 
33:786:65286:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:each couple. Forty years after the start of this policy, China is beginning to see a serious aging 
33:787:65385:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:problem  in  China.  Figure  13  depicts  China’s  working-age  population  along  with  the  old-age 
33:788:65487:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dependency ratio (i.e., the ratio of older people in the full population) from 1990 to 2016. China’s 
33:789:65588:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:working-age population reached to its peak in 2014 and has started to decline, while the old-age 
33:790:65685:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dependency ratio has substantially grown from 8.3% in 1990 to 15% in 2016. With this trajectory, 
33:791:65782:21:21:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China will inevitably become an “old” society. This aging population will put great pressure on 
33:792:65878:21:20:72:543:563:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the demand for housing in the long run because houses currently owned by the older generation 
33:793:65972:20:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:will be eventually transferred to the current younger generations, which are smaller. In 2016, the 
33:794:66071:21:21:72:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Chinese government officially replaced the One-Child Policy by a Two-Child Policy, which allows 
33:795:66167:21:20:72:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:each couple to have two children. While this new policy will help to eventually improve the 
33:796:66259:20:21:72:543:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:population structure, its effect is unlikely to be felt quickly enough to avoid the housing market 
33:797:66358:21:29:72:282:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:pressure induced by the aging population.
