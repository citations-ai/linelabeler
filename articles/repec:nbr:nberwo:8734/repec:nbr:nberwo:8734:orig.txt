2:24:1046:41:17:108:539:554:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Prior experimental and empirical research documents that many investors have a lower propensity
2:25:1141:17:17:72:538:537:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to  sell  those  stocks  on  which  they  have  a  capital  loss.  This  behavioral  phenomenon,  known  as  ìthe
2:26:1254:17:17:72:538:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:disposition effect,î has implications for equilibrium prices. We investigate the temporal pattern of stock
2:27:1360:17:17:72:538:503:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:prices in an equilibrium that aggregates the demand functions of both rational and disposition investors.
2:28:1465:17:17:72:538:486:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The disposition effect creates a spread between a stockís fundamental value -- the stock price that would
2:29:1570:17:17:72:538:469:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:exist in the absence of a disposition effect -- and its market price. Even when a stockís fundamental value
2:30:1677:17:17:72:538:452:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:follows  a  random  walk,  and  thus  is  unpredictable,  its  equilibrium  price  will  tend  to  underreact  to
2:31:1790:17:17:72:539:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:information. Spread convergence, arising from the random evolution of fundamental values, generates
2:32:1889:17:17:72:538:418:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:predictable equilibrium prices. This convergence implies that stocks with large past price runups and
2:33:1990:17:17:72:538:401:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stocks on which most investors experienced capital gains have higher expected returns that those that
2:34:2091:17:17:72:538:384:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have  experienced  large  declines  and  capital  losses.  The  profitability  of  a  momentum  strategy,  which
2:35:2203:17:17:72:538:367:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:makes use of this spread, depends on the path of past stock prices. Crosssectional empirical tests of the
2:36:2308:17:17:72:538:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:model find that stocks with large aggregate unrealized capital gains tend to have higher expected returns
2:37:2413:17:17:72:538:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:than stocks with large aggregate unrealized capital losses and that this capital gains ìoverhangî appears
2:38:2518:17:17:72:538:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to be the key variable that generates the profitability of a momentum strategy. When this capital gains
2:39:2621:17:17:72:538:299:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variable is used as a regressor along with past returns and volume to predict future returns, the momentum
2:40:2727:17:74:72:151:282:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect disappears.

3:48:2993:0:15:89:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Momentum, which is the persistence in the returns of stocks over horizons between three
3:49:3080:15:16:71:540:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:months and one year, remains one of the most puzzling anomalies infinance. Jegadeesh and
3:50:3168:16:15:71:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Titman (1993), for example, found that pastwinning stocks, as measured by returns over
3:51:3254:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the prior six months tended to subsequently outperform past losing stocks by about twelve
3:52:3343:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:percent per year. Various explanations for momentum have been advanced, but few have
3:53:3427:15:15:71:540:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:stood up to rigorous empirical tests or calibration. Moreover, most of these explanations are
3:54:3520:15:15:71:540:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:more rooted in attempts to explain momentum than in developing a general theory of how
3:55:3606:15:19:71:305:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:demand for stocks affects equilibrium pricing.
3:56:3652:19:15:89:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:While momentum-motivated theories have been categorized as belonging to thefield
3:57:3732:15:16:71:539:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of behavioralfinance, there is a seemingly unrelated branch of the literature in behavioral
3:58:3823:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f5:finance that documents stylized facts about investor behavior. It is motivated by experiments
3:59:3916:15:15:71:539:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:on individual investors and observations of their behavior in realfinancial markets. It rarely
3:60:4010:15:15:71:540:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:attempts to link its stylized facts about investor behavior to equilibrium prices. Perhaps the
3:61:4104:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:most well-documented behavioral regularity in this literature is what Shefrin and Statman
3:62:4193:15:15:71:540:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(1985) termed “the disposition effect.” This is the tendency of investors to hold onto their
3:63:4285:15:19:71:419:440:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:losing stocks to a greater extent than they hold onto their winners.1
3:64:4354:19:15:89:540:421:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This paper analyzes how aggregate demand and equilibrium prices evolve over time when
3:65:4439:15:15:71:540:406:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:they are affected by the existence of afixed proportion of investors who exhibit the dispo-
3:66:4530:15:16:71:540:391:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sition effect. It is possible to analytically prove that if some investors are subject to the
3:67:4623:16:15:71:539:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disposition effect, then stocks with aggregate unrealized capital gains tend to outperform
3:68:4713:15:15:71:539:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:stocks with aggregate unrealized capital losses. This paper shows, both theoretically and
3:69:4802:15:15:71:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:empirically, that the disposition effect may account for the tendency of past winning stocks
3:70:4894:15:19:71:309:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to subsequently outperform past losing stocks.
3:71:4940:19:15:89:539:311:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The intuition for our model is rather simple. Assume for the moment that some investors,
3:72:5028:15:15:71:540:296:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:thedispositioninvestors, perturb otherwise rational demand functions for a stock they own
3:73:5117:15:15:71:539:281:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:because they have experienced unrealized capital gains or losses in the stock. Such investors
3:74:5210:15:16:71:540:266:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:would tend to have higher demand for losing stocks than for winning stocks, other things
3:75:5298:16:15:71:539:250:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equal. If demand for that same stock by other investors is not perfectly elastic, then such
3:76:5389:15:15:71:540:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:demand perturbation, induced by a disposition effect, tends to generate price underreaction
3:77:5480:15:15:71:539:220:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to public information. Stocks that have been privy to good news in the past would have excess
3:78:5573:15:16:85:546:205:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:1The disposition effect is sometimes linked to, but is really distinct fromloss aversion.Lossaversion
3:79:5674:16:12:71:539:189:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:occurs when two conditions are met: (i) the decline in utility for a loss (measured relative to a reference
3:80:5781:12:12:71:539:177:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:point) exceeds the increase in utility for an equal sized gain (relative to the same reference point); (ii) a
3:81:5890:12:12:71:539:165:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:gamble that is always a loss relative to the reference point generates higher utility than a certain loss with the
3:82:6004:12:12:71:539:153:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:same mean while the reverse preference applies to gambles that are always gains. In a market with a single
3:83:6110:12:12:71:539:141:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:risky asset, one can see how an investor might be more likely to substitute a risk-free asset for a risky asset
3:84:6221:12:12:71:539:129:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:in a gain situation (where utility is locally concave) than a loss situation (where utility is locally convex).
3:85:6332:12:12:71:539:117:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:However, in a multiasset multiperiod framework, it is necessary to argue that reference prices change to
3:86:6436:12:12:71:540:105:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:induce substitution of one risky asset with a paper gain or loss for another. This complex setting is atypical
3:87:6546:12:12:71:539:93:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:in the modeling of loss aversion. Moreover, once we allow for such reference price changes, there is little
3:88:6653:12:0:71:328:81:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:need for the remaining utility assumptions of loss aversion.
4:89:6714:0:15:71:540:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:selling pressure relative to stocks that have beenprivy to adverse information. This produces
4:90:6807:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a spread between the fundamental value of thestock — its equilibrium price in the absence
4:91:6896:16:15:71:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of any disposition effect among investors — and the market price of the stock. Aggregate
4:92:6984:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investor demand equals supply in the model when the stock price is a weighted average of its
4:93:7076:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fundamental value and a reference price (related to the basis at which disposition investors
4:94:7168:15:19:71:173:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:acquired the stock).
4:95:7188:19:15:89:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The demand perturbation and associated spread does not, per se, generate momentum
4:96:7269:15:15:71:539:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in stock returns. For momentum to arise, there must be some mechanism that forces market
4:97:7357:15:15:71:540:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:prices to revert to fundamental values. As one example of the importance of this reversion,
4:98:7448:15:16:71:539:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:note that if all investors are identical and subject to the disposition effect, market prices
4:99:7541:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:deviate from fundamental values. However, in the absence of trading, it would be reasonable
4:100:7632:15:15:71:539:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to conclude that the reference price (such as the cost basis) of disposition investors would
4:101:7724:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:not change. In this case, the associated demand perturbation generates a market price that
4:102:7814:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is a constant weighted average of the stock’s fundamental value and afixed reference price.
4:103:7905:15:15:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Because the weights are constant, changes in market prices are just dampened versions of
4:104:7993:15:16:71:539:440:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:changes in fundamental values. Hence, if fundamental values follow a random walk, so do
4:105:8080:16:18:71:472:424:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:market prices, despite their underreaction to information about fundamentals.
4:106:8157:18:15:89:539:406:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:One could imagine various forces that drive market prices to their fundamental values,
4:107:8243:15:16:71:539:391:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:thus generating momentum. A press release about an acquisition, an earnings announcement,
4:108:8332:16:15:71:539:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and a reduction in uncertainty all are events that may make some investors rely less on
4:109:8419:15:15:71:539:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:their behavioral tendency to sell winners and hold onto losers. However, it is surprising to
4:110:8511:15:15:71:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:discover that a random process for a stock’s fundamental value, in and of itself, makes a
4:111:8600:15:15:71:539:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:stock’s reference price, and hence its market price, catch up with its associated fundamental
4:112:8693:15:15:71:539:315:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value. In other words, trading, which arises in the model only because some investors exhibit
4:113:8786:15:16:71:539:300:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the disposition effect, produces mean reversion in thespreadbetween a stock’s fundamental
4:114:8875:16:15:71:539:284:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value and its market price. By definition, the stochastic process for a stock’s market price is

4:116:9062:15:15:71:539:254:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reversion in the stochastic process for the spread implies that stocks with positive spreads
4:117:9154:15:15:71:540:239:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:have risk-adjusted mean returns that exceed the risk-free return, while those with negative
4:118:9245:15:15:71:540:224:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:spreads have risk-adjusted mean returns that are below the risk-free return. The mean return
4:119:9337:15:16:71:539:209:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of a stock that is a big winner, which tends to have a positive spread between its fundamental
4:120:9431:16:15:71:539:193:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value and market price, thus tends to exceed that of a loser, which tends to have a negative
4:121:9523:15:19:71:107:178:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:spread.
4:122:9530:19:15:89:540:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The difference between the market price and the reference price is proportional to the
4:123:9616:15:15:71:539:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:spread between the fundamental value and the market price. Thus, it, too, is of the same
4:124:9704:15:15:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sign as the expected return. If the reference price is related to some aggregate cost basis
4:125:9795:15:15:71:539:114:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in the market, as the motivation for this paper suggests, this difference is a gain measured
4:126:9887:15:19:71:324:99:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:relative to a reference price that is the cost basis.
4:127:9940:19:0:89:540:80:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The empirical implications of the model, outlined above, are verified with cross-sectional
5:128:10031:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:“Fama-MacBeth” regressions that make use of a “capital gains overhang” regressor to proxy
5:129:10120:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for aggregate unrealized capital gains or losses. In all of our regression specifications, the
5:130:10214:16:15:71:544:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gain variable predicts future returns, even after controlling for the effectofpastreturns,
5:131:10304:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:but the reverse is rarely true. Indeed, in most of our regression specifications, there is no
5:132:10397:15:19:71:505:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:momentum effect once the disposition effect is controlled for with the gain regressor.
5:133:10483:19:15:89:539:591:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Section I of the paper presents results derived from a model with two types of investors:

5:135:10664:15:15:71:539:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:except that the disposition effect perturbs his demand function for stocks. These include
5:136:10753:15:15:71:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:results about the temporal pattern of equilibrium prices conditional on both aggregate capital
5:137:10847:15:16:71:542:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gains and past returns. It also includes resultsaboutthedeterminantsoftradesandvolume.
5:138:10933:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Section II presents empirical data and provides numerous tests illustrating that ourfindings
5:139:11025:15:15:71:539:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:are not due to omitted variables that others have used in the literature to analyze momentum.
5:140:11118:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Our mainfinding here is that the capital gains overhang is a critical variable in any study of

5:142:11306:15:15:71:540:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:discusses the relation of our work to prior literature, both theoretical and empirical. Section

5:146:11520:16:15:71:539:350:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:focus on how the partial demand function of a single risky stock among possibly many assets

6:160:12238:15:16:126:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the demand functions for the stock.2This parameter is actually a function that
6:161:12316:16:15:126:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:can be contingent on just about anything in the datetinformation set of investors,

6:170:12847:29:15:89:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Forλ>0, one of the two investor-types is relatively more averse to realizing losses.
6:171:12931:15:15:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:When this investor-type has a paper capital loss, he holds more shares than his rational
6:172:13019:15:15:71:539:440:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:counterpart. It would be wrong to model him as focused only on stocks that have declined
6:173:13107:15:15:71:539:425:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in value since their purchase. Disposition investors are not characterized by a propensity to
6:174:13200:15:15:71:540:410:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:accumulate more stock than rational behavior would suggest. Rather, the experimental and
6:175:13288:15:16:71:540:395:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:empirical evidence only indicates that their propensity to sell stocks they have lost money
6:176:13379:16:15:71:539:379:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:on is less than their propensity to sell stocks they have made money on. Hence, the other
6:177:13468:15:15:71:539:364:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:side of the coin of loss aversion is a relatively greater propensity to sell stocks experiencing
6:178:13564:15:15:71:539:349:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a gain. As our demand function suggests, when good news about the fundamental of the
6:179:13648:15:15:71:539:334:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:stock arrives after the loss averse investor has bought it, he experiences a paper gain, and
6:180:13740:15:15:71:539:319:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sells more of the stock than he would if he were fully rational and the stock was trading at
6:181:13832:15:19:71:152:304:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:thesameprice.
6:182:13845:19:15:89:539:285:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The experimental and empirical evidence focuses on active buying and selling behavior.
6:183:13931:15:16:71:540:270:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Modeling equilibrium requires that buying and selling behavior be endogenously derived
6:184:14017:16:15:71:539:254:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:from demand functions. For an investor to have a greater propensity to sell a stock with
6:185:14105:15:15:71:539:239:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a paper gain, the excess demand of that investor must be lower for such a stock than it
6:186:14192:15:16:85:539:224:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:2To isolate the impact of the disposition effect, and avoid possible confounding effects arising, for example,
6:187:14302:16:12:71:540:208:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:from differences in risk aversion across investor-types, we assume that all investor-types have the same slope
6:188:14412:12:8:71:318:196:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:to the rational component of their demand functions,bt.
6:189:14467:8:12:85:531:188:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:3We can think ofbtas being whatever solves for the optimal demand function given a utility function.
6:190:14567:12:16:85:539:176:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:4For our results, it is not necessary to be precise about how one arrives at this fundamental value. We
6:191:14670:16:12:71:539:160:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:would merely like the fundamental value to converge to the equilibrium price as the number of disposition
6:192:14775:12:11:71:539:148:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:agents converges to zero. Two specific alternatives come to mind. In thefirst, the fundamental value at
6:193:14878:11:12:71:540:137:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:datetis the market price that would prevail at datetif all agents were fully rational but behaved under the
6:194:14985:12:12:71:540:125:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:assumption that, in the future there would bedisposition agents and equilibria as specified in the model. In
6:195:15093:12:12:71:540:113:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:thesecond,thedatetfundamental value is the price that would prevail if all agents were fully rational and
6:196:15198:12:12:71:540:101:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:assumes that, in the future, all agents continue to be fully rational. In the appendix, we employ the former
6:197:15306:12:12:71:539:89:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:alternative to analytically compute fundamental values and market prices for a multiperiod exponential
6:198:15408:12:0:71:411:77:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:model. This interpretation ofFmakes the fundamental value a function ofλ.
7:199:15482:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:would be in the absence of disposition behavior (as described above). For an investor to
7:200:15570:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:have a lower propensity to sell a stock with a paper loss, the excess demand of that investor
7:201:15663:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:must be higher for that stock. One can quibble about what the experimental and empirical
7:202:15751:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:evidence on buying and selling behavior has on the functional form of the demand function.
7:203:15841:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:We have no interest in debating this issue, as there is little evidence about what the true
7:204:15932:15:15:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:demand functions of such investors look like.5In the interest of parsimony and tractability,
7:205:16024:15:15:71:539:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equation (2) simply assumes a functional form for the deviation from rational behavior where
7:206:16116:15:19:71:272:565:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:the deviation parameterλis constant.6
7:207:16153:19:15:89:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Note that ifλis zero, (or, alternatively, ifμ= 0), so that all investors are “rational,”
7:208:16241:15:28:71:440:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:aggregate demand, a weighted average of these two demand functions is
7:209:16310:28:27:217:394:503:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(1−μ)Drt+μDdt=1+bt(Ft−Pt)
7:210:16335:27:15:71:539:476:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and thus, withbtW= 0, supply equals demand whenFt=Pt. In this sense, the fundamental
7:211:16419:15:15:71:539:461:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:valueFis simply the price that would prevail in the absence of a disposition effect. The
7:212:16507:15:15:71:539:446:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fundamental value is thus the present value of the free cashflow stream of the stock con-
7:213:16596:15:15:71:539:431:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:ditional on all information currently available, adjusted for the risk premium.7One of the
7:214:16686:15:15:71:539:416:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:main goals of this paper is to assess how the disposition effect alters the stochastic process for
7:215:16784:15:16:71:540:401:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium prices. As a benchmark, and consistent with an extensive literature infinance,
7:216:16874:16:27:71:390:385:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:we assume that the fundamental value follows a random walk:
7:217:16933:27:27:264:539:358:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:Ft+1=Ft+6t+1(3)
7:218:16948:27:15:71:268:331:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:where the6s are i.i.d. and mean zero.8
7:219:16986:15:16:85:539:316:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:5Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), however, estimate that large positive (negative) price deviations from
7:220:17089:16:8:71:255:300:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:the cost basis generate more (fewer) sales.
7:221:17132:8:16:85:539:292:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:6In the interest of lucidity, we see no point to artificially complicating the model with utility functions.
7:222:17240:16:12:71:539:276:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:The solution to rational investor demand may affect the fundamental value; beyond this, however, it is not
7:223:17346:12:8:71:341:264:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:present in the equation that determines the equilibrium price.
7:224:17408:8:16:85:539:256:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:7The precise structure of dividends, free cashflows, or information is not important for our purpose. For
7:225:17513:16:12:71:539:240:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:example, we can assume the stock pays a dividend eachperiod or only one liquidating dividend at some far

7:227:17634:8:16:85:539:220:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:8As we demonstrate in a subsequent footnote, the absence of a random walk for fundamental values

7:229:17839:11:12:71:539:193:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:Alternatively, if a random walk does not apply to fundamental values, our results are simply measuring
7:230:17941:12:12:71:539:181:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:the incremental stochastic processes arising from disposition agents. That is, we are providing closed form

7:232:18153:12:12:71:540:157:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:would prevail in the absence of disposition agents. However, our desire to ignore the confounding effects
7:233:18258:12:12:71:539:145:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:of changing risk premia arising from in an equilibrium generated by an intertemporal representative agent

8:238:18605:27:15:89:540:644:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Whenλ= 0, both investor types are rational and hold 1−μandμshares, respectively.
8:239:18685:15:15:71:540:629:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Thus, there is no trading. However, whenλis nonzero, the demand of the type-dinvestors
8:240:18771:15:15:71:539:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is also affected by the unrealized capital gain as measured relative to their reference price.
8:241:18865:15:15:71:539:599:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This provides the key motive for trade between the two types of investors. Thus, at each

8:254:19448:15:15:71:540:366:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value and the reference price. Since 0<w<1, the market price underreacts to public infor-
8:255:19537:15:15:71:540:351:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:mation about the fundamental value, holding the reference price constant. (Market prices
8:256:19625:15:15:71:539:336:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:also underreact for reference prices that follow equilibrium paths, as we will see shortly.) The
8:257:19721:15:16:71:539:321:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:degree of underreaction, measured byw, depends on the proportion of disposition investors,

8:260:19984:15:19:71:473:275:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:perturbs demand, the closer the market price will be to its fundamental value.
8:261:20062:19:15:89:540:256:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To illustrate how changes in the fundamental value of the stock affect equilibrium prices,
8:262:20152:15:15:71:540:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:consider a case where type-dinvestors’ entire holding of shares was purchased at a funda-
8:263:20241:15:15:71:540:226:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:mental, market, and reference price of $100 pershare last period. Because the three prices
8:264:20331:15:15:71:539:211:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:were equal, type-dholdings equalμshares. Suddenly, bad news arrives and the fundamental
8:265:20418:15:15:71:539:196:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value drops to $80. The equilibrium price must end up between the fundamental value of
8:266:20504:15:16:71:539:181:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:$80 and the reference price of $100. At a priceat or below $80, the stock is too attractive as
8:267:20598:16:15:71:543:165:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the demand functions of both types of investorssuggestthattheywouldwanttoholdmore
8:268:20679:15:15:71:540:150:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:than they currently own. Equilibrium prices cannot be those at which aggregate demand
8:269:20764:15:15:71:539:135:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for the stock exceeds one share. Similarly, the equilibrium price cannot be at or above $100
8:270:20856:15:15:71:539:120:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:either, since aggregate demand would be below one share and both investor-types would like
8:271:20946:15:19:71:209:105:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to sell stock at such prices.
8:272:20975:19:15:89:540:86:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:If the fundamental value of the stock is $80, type-rinvestors want to sell some of the
8:273:21061:15:0:71:539:71:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f16:stock they own at prices above $80.  At some price between $80 and $100, these type-r
9:274:21147:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors exactly accommodate the extra buying pressure from the type-dinvestors. The
9:275:21232:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:market will be in equilibrium at this price, a weighted average of the fundamental value and
9:276:21324:16:15:71:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the reference price.9Since the equilibrium price must lie between $80 and $100 per share, the
9:277:21417:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:downward price response to the news is sluggish, settling at a weighted average of the past
9:278:21508:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price at which shares were purchased by disposition investors and the fundamental value.
9:279:21596:15:19:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(A similar argument applies for good news thatgenerates a fundamental value above $100.)
9:280:21684:19:15:89:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:In the illustration above, we had some trades at $100 per share (by assumption) at what
9:281:21771:15:15:71:539:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:we will refer to as date 0 and then another set oftrades occurring at some price between $80
9:282:21863:15:15:71:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and $100 at date 1. Knowing the parameters of the model would have allowed us to solve
9:283:21949:15:16:71:539:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for the date 1 equilibrium price as the single unknown of a linear equation. Assume for the
9:284:22040:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:moment that this price turned out to be $85. To solve for the date 2 equilibrium price as
9:285:22129:15:15:71:540:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a function of the date 2 fundamental value, itis critical that we know the date 2 reference
9:286:22220:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price. It seems reasonable to think that this reference price is going to be some weighted
9:287:22310:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:average of $100 and $85. If we know this reference price, solving for the equilibrium price as
9:288:22404:15:38:71:371:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a function of the date 2 fundamental value is again trivial.

9:292:22669:15:15:71:539:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with the existing experimental and empirical evidence, is that the type-dinvestors’ reference
9:293:22762:15:28:71:260:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price satisfies the difference equation

9:295:22822:27:18:71:507:290:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:whereνt, a function of the type-dinvestors’ datetinformation, lies between 0 and 1.
9:296:22905:18:16:89:539:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This specification implies that the reference price can be any weighted average of past

9:307:23204:15:15:71:540:179:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:as to not require even this restriction. For the theoreticalfindings in this section, the interval

9:309:23395:16:15:71:539:148:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:For example, the reference price dynamics specified in equation (6) is not only consistent
9:310:23485:15:15:71:540:133:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with the type-dinvestors’ cost basis as the reference price; it is also consistent with the
9:311:23576:15:16:85:539:118:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:9Clearly, although we do not make use of utility functions, the fact that demand functions are not perfectly

9:313:23797:8:16:81:540:94:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f17:10Iteratively expanding equation (6) implies that the weight on datet−τ’s price,ωt−τ=(1−νt)(1−

10:317:24178:16:18:71:92:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:two.
10:318:24182:18:16:89:540:622:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Empirical analyses, presented later inthe paper, requires a more precise specification of
10:319:24271:16:15:71:540:606:144:g_d0_f19:144:g_d0_f5:νt. As one example, we might assume that each share is as likely to trade as any other and
10:320:24361:15:15:71:539:591:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:that the probability of a trade in a share on any one day is independent of when it has traded
10:321:24455:15:15:71:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in the past. In this case, a proxy for the aggregate cost basis of the outstanding shares is

10:326:24893:15:18:71:254:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:under the assumptions given above.
10:327:24927:18:16:89:540:482:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Earlier, we argued that market prices,Pt, respond sluggishly to changes in the fundamen-

10:329:25105:15:15:71:539:451:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sluggishly to changes in the fundamental value. We can see this by substituting equation (5)
10:330:25197:15:15:71:165:436:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:into (6), obtaining

10:332:25239:22:15:71:539:399:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This equation also points out that the reference price is always reverting to the fundamental

10:338:25630:15:15:71:539:274:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fully rational behavior. Modeling dispositionbehavior in this form allows us to calculate
10:339:25719:15:16:71:539:259:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:closed form equilibrium prices as functions of fully rational prices, the fundamental values.
10:340:25812:16:15:71:539:243:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This appears to be almost too good to be true as the fundamental values cannot be solved
10:341:25900:15:15:71:539:228:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for directly, except in very special cases.11Moreover, fully rationalbehavior recognizes that
10:342:25993:15:15:71:539:213:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disposition investors exists. Rest assured that with virtually any reasonable intertemporal
10:343:26084:15:15:71:539:198:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:utility function, this does not generate an infinite loop that fails to generate an equilibrium.
10:344:26180:15:15:71:539:183:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The type-rinvestors, unless they are risk neutral, do not fully undo the impact of the
10:345:26266:15:16:71:540:168:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:type-dinvestors perturbation.  As a consequence, the equilibrium does not collapse.  To
10:346:26353:16:15:71:539:152:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:illustrate this point — that the type-rinvestors can solve for optimal demand recognizing
10:347:26442:15:15:71:539:137:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the impact of type-rinvestors who partly mimic them, and that a Walrasian auctioneer
10:348:26526:15:15:71:539:122:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:can solve for prices that arise from the specified demand structure — we derive closed form
10:349:26617:15:16:71:539:107:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:solutions for demand and prices in one very special case: In this case, we solve for a date 0
10:350:26710:16:15:81:539:91:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:11As noted earlier, closed form solutions for equilibria in intertemporal models have been found only in
10:351:26814:15:0:71:125:76:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:trivial cases.

11:354:27005:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fundamental value at date 2 is normally distributed, and that the information about the date
11:355:27097:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:2 value that arrives at date 1 also is normally distributed. The closed form solutions for the

11:357:27278:15:15:71:540:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium price and fundamental value functions, are found in theappendix. This should
11:358:27366:15:15:71:540:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:be sufficiently convincing that there is nothing aberrational going on within our model,
11:359:27454:15:38:71:423:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:despite an underlying complexity that has been deliberately masked.
11:360:27521:38:27:71:240:527:207:g_d0_f24:207:g_d0_f24:D. Expected Price Changes
11:361:27546:27:15:89:540:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Although the fundamental value, by assumption, follows a random walk, changes in
11:362:27626:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium prices are predictable in this model. To see this, note that by equation (5), the
11:363:27719:15:25:71:242:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price change can be expressed as:
11:364:27752:25:25:185:638:445:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:Pt+1−Pt=w(Ft+1−Ft)+(1−w)(Rt+1−Rt)(9)
11:365:27788:25:25:71:264:420:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and thus the expected price change is
11:366:27825:25:25:216:663:395:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Et[Pt+1−Pt]=(1−w)(Rt+1−Rt)(10)
11:367:27855:25:25:71:410:370:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Subtracting equation (10) from (9)and substituting in (3) implies
11:368:27920:25:25:220:391:345:144:g_d0_f16:64:g_d0_f8:Pt+1−Pt−Et[Pt+1−Pt]=w6t+1
11:369:27945:25:15:71:539:320:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:proving that price changes underreact to news about fundamentals. Although this may con-
11:370:28033:15:15:71:539:305:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tradict the suggestion in Shiller (1981) that prices are too volatile relative to fundamentals,
11:371:28128:15:19:71:538:290:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the lower price volatility feature is a necessaryfeature of any model of price underreaction.
11:372:28221:19:15:89:539:271:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Equation (10) implies that changes in equilibrium prices are predictable. Reference prices

11:374:28388:25:25:240:687:231:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:Rt+1−Rt=wνt(Ft−Rt)(11)
11:375:28410:25:25:71:304:206:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:which, substituted into equation (10), implies
11:376:28456:25:25:213:660:181:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Et[Pt+1−Pt]=w(1−w)νt(Ft−Rt)(12)
11:377:28487:25:24:71:293:156:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Alternatively, this equation is equivalent to
11:378:28532:24:25:233:680:132:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Et[Pt+1−Pt]=wνt(Ft−Pt)(13)

11:381:28594:20:0:71:529:71:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:by the equilibrium pricing condition, equation (5). Thesefindings are summarized below:
12:382:28682:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f9:Proposition 1If the datetfundamental value exceeds datet’s market price (or reference
12:383:28767:15:14:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:price), or if the datetmarket price exceeds datet’s reference price, then the stock price is
12:384:28859:14:15:71:539:642:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:expected to increase next period. Similarly, if the datetfundamental value is exceeded by
12:385:28948:15:14:71:539:627:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:datet’s market price (or reference price), or if the datetmarket price is exceeded by datet’s
12:386:29041:14:14:71:539:613:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:reference price, then the stock price is expected to decrease next period. The expected price
12:387:29134:14:15:71:539:599:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:change is proportional to the change in the reference price. Moreover, the expected return is
12:388:29227:15:14:71:539:584:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:increasing in the difference between the fundamental value and the market (or the reference)
12:389:29319:14:15:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:price, or in the difference between the market and reference prices, and in the weight placed
12:390:29412:15:32:71:375:555:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:on the current market price in updating the reference price.
12:391:29472:32:15:89:539:523:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Hence the datetunrealized gaingt,defined as the difference between the market and
12:392:29553:15:15:71:153:508:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference prices,

12:394:29582:22:31:71:540:471:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:or, alternatively, the datetspread between the fundamentalvalue and the equilibrium price

12:401:29862:15:19:71:539:380:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:by the innovation in the fundamental value, which is the model’s only source of uncertainty.
12:402:29954:19:15:89:539:361:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The sign of the datetspread between the fundamental value and the equilibrium price is
12:403:30040:15:15:71:540:346:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the same as the sign of the expected future price change, Et[Pt+1−Pt], because the former
12:404:30129:15:27:71:291:331:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:spread is mean reverting and by definition,
12:405:30172:27:27:174:437:304:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:Pt+1−Pt=(Ft−Pt)−(Ft+1−Pt+1)+(Ft+1−Ft)
12:406:30209:27:28:71:214:277:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:which has an expectation of
12:407:30236:28:27:196:643:249:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Et[Pt+1−Pt]=(Ft−Pt)−Et[Ft+1−Pt+1](17)
12:408:30273:27:15:71:539:222:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:since the fundamental value follows a random walk. However, with mean reversion in the
12:409:30359:15:15:71:540:207:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:spread, the expectation on the right side of equation (17) is smaller in absolute terms than
12:410:30451:15:15:71:539:192:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the term in parentheses it is subtracted from. Hence, if the spread,Ft−Pt, is positive, the
12:411:30542:15:15:71:539:177:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:difference between the spread and the expected spread is positive; if the spread is negative,
12:412:30635:15:15:71:540:162:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the difference is negative.  To understand why this mean reversion exists, we prove the
12:413:30722:15:31:71:181:147:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:following proposition.
12:414:30744:31:15:71:539:116:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f9:Proposition 2The gaingt, which is the difference between the market and reference prices,
12:415:30833:15:14:71:539:101:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:mean reverts towards zero. The rate of mean reversion is greater the larger is the absolute
12:416:30924:14:15:71:540:87:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:magnitude ofνt, and the smaller isλandμ. The same result applies to the spread,Ft−Pt,
12:417:31009:15:0:71:195:72:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:andtothegap,Ft−Rt.
13:418:31029:0:26:71:275:671:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f5:Proof: By equations (3), (11), and (15),
13:419:31069:26:26:241:540:645:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:gt+1−gt=w6t+1−wνtgt(18)
13:420:31092:26:15:71:540:619:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Hence, Et[gt+1−gt]=−wνtgt. The mean reversion speed is not constant, but is increasing
13:421:31178:15:15:71:540:604:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:inνtandw. The spread and gap are constant proportions of the gain so this result also
13:422:31263:15:26:71:232:589:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f36:applies to the spread or gap.q
13:423:31293:26:16:89:544:563:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Proposition 2 states that the reference priceisalwaystryingtocatchuptothelatest
13:424:31372:16:15:71:539:547:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fundamental value (and market price). As trading occurs, the reference price gets updated
13:425:31461:15:15:71:539:532:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with some weighting of the latest market price, which, in turn, is updated by the latest
13:426:31549:15:15:71:539:517:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fundamental value. This implies that the gain, the spread, and the gap tend to narrow over
13:427:31639:15:15:71:540:502:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:time. As the next result indicates, these willwiden or change sign only as a consequence of
13:428:31730:15:30:71:337:487:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:extraordinary innovations in the fundamental value.
13:429:31781:30:14:71:539:457:144:g_d0_f14:144:g_d0_f9:Proposition 3If the datetgain,gt, is positive (negative), it will continue to be positive
13:430:31870:14:15:71:539:443:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:(negative) unless a sufficiently large negative (positive)shock to the fundamental arrives.
13:431:31961:15:14:71:539:428:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:Assume thatνtis positive.  Then, the absolute magnitude of the gain will increase next
13:432:32047:14:15:71:540:414:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:period only if a significant shock of the same sign as the gain arrives. Otherwise, the absolute
13:433:32143:15:14:71:539:399:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:magnitude of the gain will decrease next period. The same results apply to the spread and
13:434:32232:14:30:71:111:385:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:the gap.
13:435:32240:30:16:71:539:355:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f5:Proof: All statements follow from equation (18) which states thatgt+1=w6t+1+(1−wνt)gt.
13:436:32326:16:15:71:539:339:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Assumegt>0. Since 0<νt<1and0<w<1,gt+1>0unless6t+1is sufficiently negative.
13:437:32400:15:15:71:539:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Equation (18) also impliesgt+1−gt<0if6t+1<0orif6t+1is positive but not too large.
13:438:32481:15:15:71:539:309:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:An analogous result applies to the negative gain. Since the spreadstand gap are constant
13:439:32569:15:26:71:456:294:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f36:multiples of the gaingt, the same conclusions necessarily apply to them.q
13:440:32642:26:15:89:539:268:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The results above, applied to the unrealized gaingt, describe expected future price
13:441:32725:15:15:71:539:253:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:changes that are conditional on the relation between the market price and the reference
13:442:32812:15:16:71:539:238:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price. This suggests there is an interestingline of empirical work that explores the rela-
13:443:32902:16:15:71:539:222:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tionship between aggregate capital gains and the cross-section of expected returns. It also
13:444:32993:15:15:71:540:207:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:may explain why momentum strategies are profitable, as stocks with large positive differ-

13:446:33166:15:15:71:539:177:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:However, this difference is path dependent.  There are historical price paths for a stock,

13:452:33711:15:15:71:539:86:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:some types of paths will generate higher expected returns than others. Lacking a specific

14:455:33983:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:behavioral variables, like capital gains, and are likely to be poorer predictors of expected

14:457:34165:15:19:71:166:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:stock is generated.
14:458:34184:19:15:89:539:606:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:There is one class of past return paths for which the gain and spread are necessarily of

14:460:34362:15:15:71:540:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a reasonably lengthy historical period are those for which past returns, irrespective of the

14:463:34637:15:16:71:539:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:at a basis below the current price — thus experiencing a capital gain (or, in the case of the
14:464:34730:16:15:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:consistent losers, a capital loss). Given the reference price updating rule, and Proposition 1,

14:470:35223:15:15:71:539:395:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:if the past return is large, that these paths could dominate the abundant number of paths
14:471:35312:15:16:71:540:380:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for which the spread is positive (and thus, for example, most investors experience capital

14:473:35443:18:15:89:540:346:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Before demonstrating this formally, it is useful tofirst express the reference price explicitly

14:486:36478:15:15:71:539:120:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reason, any insights from this model do not depend on initial conditions, provided that the

15:490:36801:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:as a good approximation because the fundamental value and the market price tend to revisit
15:491:36891:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:each other as time evolves. As the following proposition proves, in continuous time, this

16:556:40735:26:15:89:539:182:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To assess whether our model generates expected price changes that bear any resemblance

16:560:41022:16:12:71:539:120:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:interval over which a price change has occurred as being symmetric with respect to any pair of consecutive
16:561:41128:12:12:71:539:108:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:dates, the above proposition goes through in exactly the same form with prices replacing fundamental values.
16:562:41236:12:12:71:539:96:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:Indeed, as long as expected price changes between two consecutive dates are of the same sign as the price

17:585:42466:26:16:111:539:387:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To obtain an expression for trading volume in the model, substitute the equilibrium
17:586:42549:16:15:71:539:371:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:pricePt, as given in equation (5), into the demand equations (1) and (2), and multiply the
17:587:42639:15:15:71:539:356:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:respective demands by 1−μandμ, respectively. This gives the equilibrium aggregate share-
17:588:42727:15:27:71:539:341:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:holding of each investor-type as a function of the unrealized gaingt=Pt−Rt. Specifically,

17:591:42931:15:16:71:539:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium shareholdings of each investor-type is proportional to the change in the unrealized
17:592:43026:16:27:71:206:256:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gain. For type-rinvestors:

17:594:43094:27:27:71:204:202:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:while for type-dinvestors:

17:596:43163:27:28:71:221:148:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:implying the following result:

17:598:43278:14:15:71:539:106:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:to type-rinvestors when their unrealized gain increases and buy stock from type-rinvestors
17:599:43368:15:0:71:204:91:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:when their gain decreases.
18:600:43396:0:15:89:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To elaborate on this point, assumect=cand substitute equation (18) into the right

18:603:43531:24:15:71:539:608:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Hence, whether type-dinvestors buy or sell depends on the sign and the magnitude of the

18:632:44434:14:15:71:539:313:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:with an increase in the market price is going to be larger when the reference price exceeds
18:633:44525:15:14:71:539:298:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:the market price than when the market price exceeds the reference price. Also, the volume

18:636:44788:26:15:89:540:244:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Stocks that have generally been experiencing price increases are those for which the

19:666:47018:15:15:71:539:293:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:suggests that the most profitable horizons generated from the model are those that use
19:667:47104:15:15:71:539:278:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:intermediate horizon past returns for portfolio formation. The numericalfinding is difficult
19:668:47196:15:15:71:539:263:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to prove analytically; however, it seems rather intuitive.  Over very short horizons, it is
19:669:47287:15:15:71:540:248:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:rather difficult for the gain to deviate from zero by a large amount, as fundamentals have
19:670:47377:15:16:71:539:233:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:not had much time to move, even among the best and worst performing stocks. While the
19:671:47462:16:15:71:539:217:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:volatility of the change in a fundamental value that follows a random walk is proportional
19:672:47552:15:15:71:540:202:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to the square root of the past horizon’s length, one must also consider how horizon affects
19:673:47643:15:15:71:540:187:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the stochastic process for the reference price.The reference price reverts to the fundamental
19:674:47736:15:15:71:540:172:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:value. Over short horizons, such reversion cannot have much of an effect. However, over
19:675:47823:15:15:71:539:157:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a long horizon, reversion to the fundamental value is likely to have a tremendous effect.
19:676:47912:15:16:71:539:142:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Indeed, as we learned earlier, the gain will be zero with probability one. Reversion in the
19:677:48003:16:18:71:402:126:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gain to zero only enhances the frequency with which this occurs.
19:678:48067:18:16:89:539:108:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A good analogy is a race between two thoroughbred horses with equal expected speed:
19:679:48150:16:15:71:539:92:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the fundamental value horse and the reference price horse. When we sort on past winners,
19:680:48238:15:0:71:539:77:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:we are saying that the fundamental value horse is in the lead. However, both shortly after
20:681:48330:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the start of the race, and towards the end of the race, he cannot have a very big lead. Near
20:682:48422:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the start, (and even assuming that the initial acceleration from the starting gate took place
20:683:48515:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:instantly), the top decile fundamental value horse has not had enough time to get far ahead,
20:684:48607:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:despite the average speed being greatest for this leg of the race. Moreover, throughout the
20:685:48698:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:race, whenever the fundamental value horse gets far ahead, the reference price horse speeds
20:686:48789:15:15:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:up. However, the fundamental value horse’s speed is not persistent. Hence, conditional on
20:687:48878:15:15:71:539:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:him being far ahead in thefirst part of the race, he is likely to slow down. This means that
20:688:48970:15:16:71:539:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the point at which the gap between the top decile fundamental value horse and the reference
20:689:49061:16:42:71:448:549:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price horse is likely to be greatest is somewhere in the middle of the race.

21:735:51442:26:15:89:540:493:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Theory allows the reference price to be any weighted average of historical market prices.
21:736:51531:15:16:71:539:478:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:In empirical work, we have to specify how the weights used to update the reference prices
21:737:51620:16:15:71:540:462:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:are determined.  Because our theory was motivated by the disposition effect, we believe
21:738:51707:15:15:71:539:447:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:that reference prices should represent the best estimate of a stock’s cost basis to disposition
21:739:51802:15:15:71:539:432:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors. Since we cannot identify who these disposition investors are, our proxy for the
21:740:51892:15:15:71:539:417:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:cost basis of a stock is an estimate of the aggregate cost basis for all outstanding shares.
21:741:51984:15:15:71:539:402:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The datetaggregate basis thus requires us to use price and volume data to estimate the
21:742:52070:15:16:71:539:387:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fraction of shares purchased at datet−n<t,atpricePt−n, that are still held by their
21:743:52153:16:15:71:539:371:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:original purchasers at datet. Summing the products of these fractions and the prices at the
21:744:52244:15:18:71:429:356:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:relevant prior dates generates the aggregate cost basis for the market.

21:779:53086:12:12:71:540:83:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:which omits this factor, because there may be a cross-sectional relation between afirm’s typicalνtandw,
21:780:53189:12:0:71:186:71:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:which we cannot estimate.
22:781:53216:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:This model is equivalent to assuming that all shares are symmetric. That is, irrespective of
22:782:53308:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:its trading history, each outstanding share is equally likely to be sold at any date. It can be
22:783:53403:16:15:71:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:shown that with a constant weekly turnover ofV, the average holding period is1Vweeks or
22:784:53490:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:approximately2Vyears. Assuming a constant weekly turnover of 1%, which is approximately
22:785:53577:15:19:71:503:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the mean for entire sample period, this implies an average holding period of 2 years.
22:786:53662:19:15:89:539:591:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:As noted earlier in the paper, the logic behind the expression for the reference price in
22:787:53751:15:15:71:540:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equation (25) is straightforward if we assumek= 1, as is the case when the sum is infinite
22:788:53841:15:15:71:540:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:rather than over 260 weeks. The turnover ratios, theVs, are then probabilities and each of
22:789:53931:15:15:71:540:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the bracketed factors inside the product symbol represents the probability that a share did
22:790:54022:15:16:71:544:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:not trade at datet−n+τ; the term in front of the product symbol,Vt−n,representsthe
22:791:54104:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:probability that the share traded at datet−n; the term in large parentheses in equation
22:792:54191:15:15:71:539:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(25) is the probability that the share’s basis is the price at datet−n; and the sum is the
22:793:54281:15:19:71:172:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:expected cost basis.
22:794:54301:19:15:89:539:466:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Observe that more recent trading prices have more weight on the reference price, other
22:795:54387:15:15:71:539:451:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:things equal. This is because the survival probability for a historical price declines geometri-
22:796:54483:15:15:71:539:436:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:cally with the passage of time. Indeed, distant prices negligibly influence the reference price.
22:797:54579:15:15:71:540:421:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Recognizing that distant market prices have little influence on the regressor, we truncate
22:798:54669:15:15:71:539:406:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the estimation atfive years and effectively rescale the weights to sum to one by having a
22:799:54758:15:16:71:539:391:144:g_d0_f16:144:g_d0_f5:k<1.  This allows us to estimate the reference price in a consistent manner across the
22:800:54844:16:15:71:540:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sample period. The 5-year cutoff, while arbitrary, allows us to analyze a reasonable portion
22:801:54936:15:15:71:540:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of our sample period: July 1967 on. Stocks that lack at leastfive years of historical return
22:802:55028:15:15:71:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and turnover data at a particular week are excluded from the cross-sectional regression for

22:806:55243:15:15:71:540:250:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gains regressor. It indicates that there is wide cross-sectional dispersion in this regressor and
22:807:55340:15:15:71:540:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a fair amount of time series variation as well. For mostfirms, the time series of this variable
22:808:55435:15:16:71:539:220:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:exhibits significant comovements with the past returns of the S&P 500. For the 10th, 50th,
22:809:55525:16:15:71:539:204:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and 90th percentile of the regressor, plotted in Figure 1, the correlations between the weekly
22:810:55619:15:15:71:539:189:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:time series of the regressor and the past one-year percentage change in the S&P 500 index
22:811:55708:15:19:71:257:174:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:are respectively 0.50, 0.60, and 0.62.
22:812:55746:19:15:89:539:155:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Table 1 Panel A reports summary statistics on each of the variables used in the regression
22:813:55836:15:15:71:540:140:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:described above.  These include time series means and standard deviations of the cross-
22:814:55923:15:15:71:539:125:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sectional averages of the dependent and independent variables, along with time series means
22:815:56014:15:16:71:276:110:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of their 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles.
22:816:56055:16:15:81:539:94:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:15We verified that our regression results remain about the same when return and turnover data over three
22:817:56159:15:0:71:336:79:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:or seven prior years are used to calculate the reference price.
23:818:56224:0:15:89:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:We obtain further insight into what determines the critical capital gains regressor by
23:819:56310:15:16:71:540:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:regressing it (cross-sectionally) on stockj’s cumulative return and average weekly turnover
23:820:56401:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for three past periods: very short term (defined as the last four weeks), intermediate horizon
23:821:56495:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(between one month and one year ago) and long horizon (between one and three years ago).
23:822:56583:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Size is also included as a control regressor. Panel B of Table I reports that, on average,
23:823:56673:15:15:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:about 59% of the cross-sectional variation in the capital gains variable can be explained
23:824:56762:15:15:71:539:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:by differences in past returns, past turnover, andfirm size. Earlier, we explained that the
23:825:56853:15:16:71:539:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference price is always trying to catch up to a fundamental value that deviates from the
23:826:56943:16:15:71:539:549:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference price for large return realizations. Consistent with this, Panel B shows that our
23:827:57034:15:15:71:539:534:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:capital gains variable, in both cases, is positively related to past returns and negatively
23:828:57125:15:15:71:539:519:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:related to past turnover. Also, consistent with the thoroughbred horse analogy explaining
23:829:57214:15:15:71:540:504:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:why intermediate horizons are most important, wefind that the effect of intermediate horizon
23:830:57306:15:15:71:539:489:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:turnover on the capital gains variable is much stronger than the effect of turnover from the
23:831:57398:15:16:71:540:474:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:other two horizons. Controlling for past returns, a low volume winner has a larger capital
23:832:57488:16:15:71:539:458:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gain, while a high volume loser has a larger capital loss. Finally, the size coefficient in this
23:833:57584:15:15:71:539:443:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:regression is significantly positive, perhaps reflecting that largefirms have grown in the past
23:834:57679:15:15:71:539:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:at horizons not captured by our past returnvariables and thus tend to have experienced
23:835:57765:15:38:71:172:413:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:larger capital gains.

23:837:57851:27:15:89:539:348:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Table 2 presents the average coefficients and time-seriest-statistics for the regression
23:838:57939:15:15:71:539:333:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:described by equation (24) and variations of it that omit certain regressors.  Each panel
23:839:58028:15:15:71:539:318:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reports average coefficients and test statistics for all months in the sample, for January
23:840:58118:15:16:71:539:303:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:only, for February-November only, and for December only. All panels include thefirm size
23:841:58206:16:15:71:539:287:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:regressor. Panel A employs only the three past return regressors. Panel B adds volume as a
23:842:58296:15:18:71:468:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:fourth regressor. Panel C adds the capital gains overhang as afifth regressor.
23:843:58374:18:16:89:539:254:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Panels A and B contain no surprises. As can be seen, when the capital gains overhang
23:844:58458:16:15:71:539:238:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:variable is excluded from the regression, thereis a reversal of returns at both the very short
23:845:58552:15:15:71:540:223:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and long horizons, but continuations in returns over the intermediate horizon. Consistent
23:846:58641:15:15:71:539:208:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with prior research, the long horizon reversal appears to be due to January. Panel B indicates
23:847:58735:15:15:71:539:193:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:that there is a volume effect, albeit one that is hard to interpret, but it does not seem to
23:848:58827:15:19:71:538:178:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:alter the conclusion about the horizons for profitable momentum and contrarian strategies.
23:849:58917:19:15:89:539:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Panel C is rather astounding, however. When the capital gains overhang regressor is
23:850:59000:15:15:71:539:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:included in the regression, there is no longer an intermediate horizon momentum effect. The
23:851:59091:15:16:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:coefficient,a2, is insignificant , both overall and from February through November. However,
23:852:59183:16:15:71:540:113:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:except for January, there is a remarkably strong cross-sectional relation between the capital
23:853:59276:15:0:71:478:98:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gains overhang variable and future returns, with a sign predicted by the model.

24:855:59384:27:15:89:539:644:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The seasonalities observed in Table II are consistent with what other researchers have
24:856:59470:15:15:71:540:629:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:found.16They are fairly easy to explain within the context of our theoretical model if we
24:857:59559:15:19:71:517:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:accept that there is an additional perturbation in demand arising from tax loss selling.
24:858:59647:19:15:89:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), for example, found that there was no disposition effect
24:859:59734:15:15:71:539:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in December, and attributed this to the marginal impact of tax loss selling. If we generalize
24:860:59827:15:27:71:317:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the demand function of the disposition investor,

24:862:59906:27:16:71:539:511:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and assume thatλtdrifts downward in December for certain, as might be expected because of
24:863:59995:16:15:71:539:495:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tax loss selling (possibly, but not necessarily, becoming negative) and reverts to its normal
24:864:60088:15:15:71:540:480:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:positive value sometime in early January, we wouldfind that the equilibrium effects of
24:865:60174:15:15:71:539:465:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:this seasonal demand perturbation would be consistent with our empiricalfindings.  The
24:866:60260:15:15:71:539:450:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:downward drift inλin December implies that market prices move closer to fundamental
24:867:60343:15:15:71:539:435:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:values.  For stocks with capital losses, implying that the fundamental value is below the
24:868:60432:15:16:71:539:420:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:market price, convergence towards the fundamental value from the decline inλrepresents
24:869:60518:16:15:71:539:404:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:an added force that makes the market price decline even further than it would wereλto
24:870:60603:15:15:71:539:389:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:remain constant. Similarly, the increase inλin early January would make the prices of these
24:871:60694:15:15:71:539:374:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:same stocks with capital losses deviate again from their fair values, leading to a January
24:872:60784:15:19:71:113:359:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reversal.
24:873:60793:19:15:89:539:340:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To understand this more formally, note that with the generalized disposition demand,
24:874:60877:15:33:71:492:325:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equation (26), the expected price change,formerly in equation (14), generalizes to

24:884:61178:15:15:71:539:229:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and Keloharju (2001) suggests that over the course of December,λdeclines to zero but is
24:885:61265:15:16:71:539:214:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:positive during the rest of the year. Viewed from the end of November, this would be like

24:888:61521:15:15:71:540:168:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:end of December,wt= 1 and larger thanwt+1. This makes the expected price change during
24:889:61607:15:16:71:319:153:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:January negatively related to the gain regressor.
24:890:61656:16:15:81:539:137:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:16For example, momentum strategies that form portfolios from past returns over intermediate horizons
24:891:61756:15:12:71:540:122:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:appear to be most effective in December, and there is a strong January reversal in the direction of expected
24:892:61864:12:12:71:539:110:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:returns when using past returns over any horizon.See, for example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Grundy

25:895:62072:27:15:89:539:644:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:To most observers, thefirst and second half of our sample period present different por-
25:896:62159:15:15:71:539:629:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:traits of the stock market. From July 1967 to March 1982, average returns were low, liquidity
25:897:62252:15:15:71:540:614:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:was low, and trading costs including commissions were high. The second half of our sam-
25:898:62339:15:15:71:539:599:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:ple period, April 1982 to December 1996 corresponds to a sea change in the stock market.
25:899:62427:15:16:71:539:584:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Beginning in August 1982, average returns and trading volume appeared to explode and
25:900:62511:16:15:71:539:568:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:trading costs rapidly declined. These subperiods also demarcate an important turning point
25:901:62601:15:15:71:540:553:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in the strength of thefirm size effect. In the second half of our sample period, size was far
25:902:62694:15:15:71:539:538:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:less important as a determinant of return premia. Despite these differences, if our theory
25:903:62784:15:15:71:539:523:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is part of the core foundation of equilibrium pricing, there should be little difference in the
25:904:62879:15:15:71:540:508:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:coefficient on our capital gains regressor. Panels D and E of Table II confirm this hypothesis.
25:905:62974:15:16:71:540:493:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:There is only about a one standard error difference between the average coefficients on the
25:906:63065:16:15:71:539:477:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:capital gains regressor in the two subperiods. In both subperiods, the average coefficient is
25:907:63158:15:19:71:162:462:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:highly significant.
25:908:63177:19:15:89:539:443:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Although we do not report this formally in a table, the signs and significance of the capital
25:909:63270:15:15:71:539:428:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gains overhang regressor are not drastically altered by restricting the sample to various size

25:918:63575:15:38:71:336:336:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:horizons as a significant predictor of future returns.

25:920:63656:26:16:89:539:272:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Could the strength of the capital gains variable as a predictor of returns be due to some
25:921:63745:16:15:71:540:256:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:alternative explanation? Table III investigates this issue with respect to two alternatives.
25:922:63837:15:15:71:539:241:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:First, Panels A and B examine whether there is some sort of interaction between afirm’s
25:923:63924:15:15:71:539:226:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:average historical turnover and future returns. For example, the results in Table II Panel
25:924:64014:15:15:71:539:211:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C may have arisen because cross-sectional differences in liquidity imply that the reference
25:925:64105:15:15:71:539:196:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:prices of more liquid stocks place greater weight on more recent prices than the reference
25:926:64195:15:16:71:539:181:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:prices of less liquid stocks. By formulating a reference price using the average turnover over
25:927:64289:16:15:71:539:165:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the past year in place of each week’s actual turnover, we assess whether it is only the cross-
25:928:64383:15:15:71:540:150:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sectional difference in liquidity that is responsiblefor the predictive power of our original
25:929:64476:15:15:71:539:135:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gain variable, or whether the information about a stock’s capital gain inherent in the time
25:930:64567:15:15:71:539:120:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:series of its historical weekly turnover also contributes to the predictive power of ourfindings
25:931:64663:15:19:71:129:105:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in Table II.
25:932:64675:19:9:89:539:86:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:In Panels A and B of Table III, we compute an alternative weektreference price using
25:933:64759:9:9:75:84:77:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f18: ̄Vj
25:934:64763:9:0:78:545:68:64:g_d0_f18:144:g_d0_f5:t,firmj’s average weekly turnover from weekst−52 tot−1 for all of the 260Vsin
26:935:64842:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equation (25).  Panel A replicates Panel C of Table II, except that in place of the gain
26:936:64930:15:16:71:540:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:variable, we compute an alternative gain variable using the alternative reference price. As
26:937:65021:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Panel A indicates, using afirm’s average turnover for the reference price computation instead
26:938:65114:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of the actual weekly turnover generates a significant coefficient on the gain variable. The
26:939:65205:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:results are similar to those of Table II Panel C, in that past returns have no predictive power.
26:940:65301:15:15:71:540:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Moreover, the coefficients andt-statistics on the alternative gain variable are similar to those
26:941:65397:15:19:71:173:580:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in Table II Panel C.
26:942:65417:19:15:89:539:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Table III Panel B runs a horse race between the two gain variables. It is identical to Table
26:943:65509:15:15:71:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:III Panel A, except that the Table II proxy forfirmj’s capital gain is added as a regressor.
26:944:65601:15:16:71:540:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The inclusion of this variable eliminates the significance of the alternative gain variable, and
26:945:65697:16:15:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:its coefficient is about the same size as that in Table II Panel C. While our original gain
26:946:65788:15:15:71:539:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:variable is based on an imperfect model of the actual capital gains overhang in the market,
26:947:65879:15:15:71:540:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:it is probably a more precise estimate of aggregate capital gains than the alternative capital
26:948:65973:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:gains proxy constructed from average historical turnover. The fact that it “knocks out” the
26:949:66064:15:15:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:alternative as a predictor of future returns is consistent with more precise estimates of the
26:950:66157:15:19:71:396:440:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:aggregate capital gain being better predictors of future returns.
26:951:66222:19:15:89:539:421:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:A second concern about the significance of our capital gains proxy in Table II is that it
26:952:66311:15:15:71:540:406:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:represents some complicated interaction between volume and past returns. For example, Lee
26:953:66400:15:16:71:539:391:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and Swaminathan (2000) suggested that high volume losers should have lower returns than
26:954:66487:16:15:71:540:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:average volume losers and empirically documented that this was indeed the case. Hence, it
26:955:66576:15:15:71:540:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is possible that ourfindings in Table II arise from the capital gains overhang variable being
26:956:66669:15:15:71:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:correlated with some interaction between intermediate horizon past returns and volume.
26:957:66755:15:15:71:539:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Panels C and D of Table III test this hypothesis by adding three turnover and past return
26:958:66844:15:19:71:162:315:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:interaction terms.
26:959:66862:19:15:89:539:296:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Table 3 Panel C analyzes the impact of these regressors in the absence of a capital gains
26:960:66951:15:15:71:539:281:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:regressor.  Even though two of the three turnover-return coefficients are significant, the
26:961:67041:15:16:71:539:266:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:inclusion of these regressors does not subsume the intermediate horizon momentum effect.
26:962:67129:16:15:71:539:250:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Rather, the volume-return interaction seems to work in part by moderating the strong one-
26:963:67218:15:19:71:186:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:month return reversal.
26:964:67240:19:15:89:539:216:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Once the capital gains variable is added tothe regression, as in Table III Panel D, the
26:965:67327:15:15:71:539:201:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:intermediate horizon past return becomes insignificant, while the capital gains coefficient
26:966:67418:15:15:71:539:186:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is highly significant.  Comparing Table II Panel C with Table III Panel D, the average
26:967:67504:15:15:71:539:171:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:regression coefficient for the capital gains variable and itst-statistic are almost unchanged
26:968:67597:15:0:71:437:156:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in the presence of the three turnover and past return interaction terms.
27:969:67671:0:31:174:437:671:298:g_d0_f14:298:g_d0_f14:III. Relation to Prior Research
27:970:67702:31:15:89:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) popularized the notion that strategies of buying stocks
27:971:67785:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with high returns over the prior three to twelve months and selling stocks with poor returns
27:972:67877:15:15:71:540:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:over the same past horizon dominates a buy and hold strategy,17Ever since then, researchers
27:973:67968:15:19:71:416:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:have attempted to come up with explanations for the phenomenon.
27:974:68031:19:15:89:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Conrad and Kaul (1998) argue that the profitability of momentum strategies could be due
27:975:68118:15:16:71:540:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to cross-sectional variation in the unconditionalexpected returns rather than any predictable
27:976:68211:16:15:71:539:545:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:time-series variation in stock returns. Yet Jegadeesh and Titman (2000)find that the cu-
27:977:68299:15:15:71:539:530:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:mulative return in months 13 to 60 after the formation of momentum portfolio is negative,
27:978:68388:15:15:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:which is inconsistent with the Conrad and Kaul hypothesis. Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999)
27:979:68477:15:15:71:540:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:show the component of momentum profits due to cross-sectional variation in unconditional
27:980:68565:15:15:71:540:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:expected returns is small. Grundy and Martin’s (2001) evidence also appears to contradict
27:981:68654:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:this hypothesis. Theyfind that the risk-adjusted profitability of a total return momentum
27:982:68743:15:16:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:strategy is more than 1.3% per month and remarkably large and stable across subperiods,
27:983:68830:16:18:71:539:439:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:even after subtracting each stock’s mean return from its return during the investment period.
27:984:68923:18:16:89:539:421:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999)find that a significant component of momentum can be
27:985:69005:16:15:71:540:405:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:explained by industry effects. However, this does not mean that individual stock momentum
27:986:69094:15:15:71:539:390:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:does not exist. Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999), Grundy and Martin (2001), and Chordia
27:987:69179:15:15:71:539:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and Shivakumar (2000) show that a component of individual stock momentum is distinct
27:988:69263:15:15:71:539:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:from industry momentum. The latter paper also argues that momentum profits are driven
27:989:69348:15:19:71:498:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:by time varying conditional expected returns that are related to the business cycle.
27:990:69432:19:15:89:538:326:144:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:Another strand of the literature uses behavioral models to explain momentum profits.18
27:991:69518:15:15:71:539:311:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:These models can be divided into two camps, depending on whether investor behavior gen-
27:992:69605:15:15:71:540:296:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:erates overreaction or underreaction. In the positive feedback trader model of DeLong et al
27:993:69696:15:16:71:539:281:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(1990b), prices initially overreact to news about fundamentals, and continue to overreact for
27:994:69789:16:15:71:540:265:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a period of time. Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam (1998) present a model where in-
27:995:69876:15:15:71:539:250:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:vestors are overconfident. This implies overeaction to private information and underreaction

27:997:70060:16:15:81:539:219:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:17Thisfinding appears to be fairly universal and robust to methodological tweaking. Rouwenhorst (1997),
27:998:70163:15:12:71:539:204:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:for example,finds that momentum strategies work in twelve European markets. Chui, Titman, and Wei

27:1000:70354:12:12:71:539:180:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:markets. Jegadeesh and Titman (2000) document that momentum profits persisted throughout the 1990s.
27:1001:70453:12:12:71:539:168:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:In contrast, other well known anomalies such as smallfirm effect and book-to-market effect disappeared after
27:1002:70561:12:12:71:539:156:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:being well-publicized. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) and Fama and French (1996)find that risk adjustment
27:1003:70663:12:12:71:540:144:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:tends to accentuate momentum profits. Chan, Jegadeesh and Lakonishok (1996) show that intermediate
27:1004:70761:12:12:71:539:132:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:horizon return continuation can be partially explained by underreaction to earnings news but that price
27:1005:70864:12:12:71:539:120:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:momentum is not subsumed by earnings momentum. Lee and Swaminathan (2000) show that past trading
27:1006:70960:12:8:71:437:108:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:volume predicts both the magnitude and the persistence of future price momentum.
27:1007:71040:8:16:81:540:100:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:18Hirshleifer (2001) gives a comprehensive account of psychological biases and empirical evidence on the
27:1008:71144:16:0:71:303:84:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:importance of investor psychology for security prices.
28:1009:71200:0:19:71:522:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:behavior generates delayed overreaction to the information which is eventually reversed.
28:1010:71288:19:15:89:539:652:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) argue that the representative heuristic19may lead
28:1011:71374:15:15:71:539:637:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors to extrapolate current earnings growth well into the future. At the same time,
28:1012:71462:15:16:71:539:622:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors’ conservativism bias leads to underreaction to new public information. In Hong
28:1013:71550:16:15:71:539:606:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and Stein (2000), agents can use only part of the information about the economy because
28:1014:71637:15:15:71:539:591:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of communication frictions. In their model, private information diffuses slowly through the
28:1015:71728:15:15:71:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:population of investors, which causes underreaction in the short run. Momentum traders
28:1016:71814:15:19:71:480:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:can profit by trend-chasing, but cause overreaction at long horizons in doing so.
28:1017:71895:19:15:89:540:542:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Our explanation of the profitability of momentum strategiesis distinct from explanations
28:1018:71983:15:15:71:539:527:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in prior research. Our investors have no cognitive biases such as those based on overcon-
28:1019:72072:15:15:71:540:512:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f5:fidence, self attribution, conservativism, or representativeness. There is no mistaken belief
28:1020:72165:15:15:71:539:497:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:about the fundamental value. There is no time variation in risk, risk aversion, or investor
28:1021:72256:15:16:71:539:482:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:sentiment driving our results. There are no hidden factors such as those based on indus-
28:1022:72344:16:15:71:540:466:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:try. Information is symmetric. In asymmetric information models, trading volume reflects
28:1023:72432:15:15:71:540:451:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors’ disagreements about a stock’s intrinsic value, and often requires the existence of
28:1024:72525:15:15:71:539:436:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:noise traders to generate trading volume. There is no information asymmetry in our model,
28:1025:72614:15:15:71:540:421:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and no noise traders, but there is volume. Trading occurs because some investors are sub-
28:1026:72703:15:15:71:540:406:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:ject to the disposition effect. Past trading volume affects the equilibrium price through its
28:1027:72796:15:16:71:540:391:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:influence on the reference price, while most extant models have a representative agent and
28:1028:72886:16:18:71:179:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:volume plays no role.
28:1029:72907:18:16:89:539:357:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Most importantly, our model is based on well-documented investor behavior and princi-
28:1030:72992:16:15:71:539:341:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:ples of psychology. Disposition behavior, while inconsistent with the standard neoclassical
28:1031:73083:15:15:71:540:326:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:framework, has been justified as a consequence of theories ofbehavior including prospect

28:1034:73347:15:15:71:539:281:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:markets. Evidence of disposition behavior among actual investors is found in Odean (1998),

28:1037:73604:15:15:71:539:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:was a greater tendency to sell stocks with paper capital gains than those with paper losses.
28:1038:73696:15:15:71:540:220:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001)find a similar effect among all types of investors in Finland,
28:1039:73788:15:15:71:539:205:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:even after controlling for a variety of variables that may determine trading. They also ob-
28:1040:73879:15:15:71:539:190:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:serve that the disposition behavior interacts with past returns in a multiplicative fashion
28:1041:73970:15:16:71:539:175:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and has a pronounced seasonality: it disappears in December. Using data from a major
28:1042:74054:16:15:71:540:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Israeli brokerage house during 1994, Shapira and Venezia show that both professional and
28:1043:74142:15:15:71:539:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:independent investors exhibit the disposition effect, although the effect is stronger for inde-
28:1044:74237:15:15:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:pendent investors. Heath, Huddart and Lang (1998) uncover disposition behavior relative to

29:1051:74719:16:15:71:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the existence of a disposition effect within a sample of professional futures traders. In their
29:1052:74814:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:study, traders held losing trades longer than winning trades and average position sizes for
29:1053:74905:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:losing trades were larger than for winners. Ferris, Haugen and Makhija (1988) argue that a
29:1054:74995:15:15:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disposition effect has to exist by studying the relationship between volume at a given point

29:1056:75185:15:16:71:540:565:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tax motivated trading. The disposition effect also influences agents in the IPO and housing

29:1061:75551:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and Johnson (1990). Their goal is to show how changing risk aversion explains the high
29:1062:75637:15:15:71:539:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:mean, high volatility, and significant predictability of stock returns. They have a representa-
29:1063:75732:15:15:71:540:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tive agent and no trading, butfind that the variation in risk aversion of their representative
29:1064:75826:15:16:71:539:440:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:agent allows returns to be much more volatile than the underlying dividends. Moreover, asset
29:1065:75918:16:15:71:539:424:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:return predictability found in their model is consistent with the profitability of contrarian
29:1066:76011:15:15:71:540:409:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:strategies.  Our model, by contrast, is consistent with contrarian strategies being money
29:1067:76100:15:15:71:540:394:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:losers and our investors limited willingness to take positions is consistent with risk aversion.
29:1068:76196:15:15:71:540:379:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Trading arises only because of the disposition effect and plays an important role in generating
29:1069:76291:15:15:71:540:364:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:momentum. Although both the house money effect and the disposition effect can be rooted
29:1070:76378:15:16:71:539:349:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:in prospect theory, the fact that they lead to such opposite results suggests that they are
29:1071:76469:16:15:71:540:333:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:truly distinct phenomena. Barberis and Huang(2001) extend this paper to multiple assets in

29:1077:77006:16:15:71:539:242:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:with loss aversion, which, for many parameter values leads to troublesome portfolio predic-

29:1079:77180:15:15:71:539:212:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:choice under loss aversion. Both papersfind that demand under loss aversion shares some
29:1080:77267:15:15:71:540:197:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:common features with the disposition effect, pointing to the possibility that loss aversion
29:1081:77358:15:16:71:299:182:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:can be consistent with the disposition effect.

30:1087:77727:31:15:89:540:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Our paper has developed a model of equilibrium asset prices based on the disposition
30:1088:77811:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:effect. By restricting loss realization aversion to be a geometric deviation from fully rational
30:1089:77907:15:15:71:539:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:behavior, we are able to generate closed form solutions and a set of powerful propositions
30:1090:77997:15:16:71:539:595:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:about conditional expected future returnswithout solving the optimal dynamic portfolio
30:1091:78083:16:15:71:539:579:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:problem of rational agents. The solution to the portfolio problem drops out of the equations
30:1092:78175:15:15:71:540:564:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:we are interested in, which focus on deviations from the rational norm. We then test the
30:1093:78263:15:15:71:539:549:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:model and surprisingly show that the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) momentum effect largely
30:1094:78351:15:15:71:539:534:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disappears. This suggests that it is the correlation between past returns and variables related
30:1095:78446:15:19:71:448:519:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to the disposition effect that may be driving momentum in stock returns.
30:1096:78518:19:15:89:540:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:In the model presented here, the critical variable determining the sign and magnitude of
30:1097:78606:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:a stock’s expected return is the difference between the stock’s market price and its reference
30:1098:78700:15:15:71:540:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:price. Despite having fully rational investors in the model, they cannot eliminate the impact
30:1099:78793:15:16:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of the gain on equilibrium prices. Although, on average, the gain shrinks, the payoffto more
30:1100:78885:16:15:71:539:439:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:rational investors is uncertain. Hence, rational investors cannot ascertain when reference
30:1101:78975:15:19:71:426:424:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:prices, and hence market prices, willconverge to fundamental values.

30:1103:79130:15:15:71:539:390:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:rational arbitrageurs who anticipate their impact on demand can front-run the other investors
30:1104:79223:15:15:71:539:375:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:and destabilize prices.  Specifically, when the rational investor receives good news today,
30:1105:79314:15:15:71:539:360:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:he buys more shares to drive up the price.  This, in turn, attracts the positive feedback
30:1106:79403:15:15:71:540:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:investors who buy tomorrow so that the rational investor can exit with a profit.  In our
30:1107:79491:15:16:71:539:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:model, there is no way to anticipate the disposition demand in advance, as it is determined
30:1108:79582:16:15:71:539:314:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:by the future realization of the fundamental value, which follows a random walk and hence
30:1109:79671:15:15:71:539:299:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is unpredictable. Any degree of risk aversion on the part of rational agents thus prevents
30:1110:79761:15:19:71:207:284:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:the model from collapsing.
30:1111:79787:19:15:89:539:265:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Our model falls in the class of “underreaction models.” However, it also points out some
30:1112:79875:15:15:71:539:250:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:interesting implications of underreaction and suggests that ourfield may have to better
30:1113:79962:15:15:71:539:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:clarify what we mean by the term. For example, Barberiset al.(1998) and Shleifer (2000)
30:1114:80049:15:15:71:540:220:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:define underreaction as occurring when the average return on the stock following good news
30:1115:80139:15:15:71:540:205:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:is higher than the average return following badnews. Our model clearly has underreaction,
30:1116:80228:15:16:71:539:190:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:but thefit with this definition is imperfect because path dependency generates cases where
30:1117:80318:16:15:71:539:174:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:this definition does not hold.25Our model points to the difficulty of measuring underreaction
30:1118:80411:15:16:81:539:159:49:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f11:25The future expected return in our model is of the same sign as the current gain. If the gain is negative
30:1119:80517:16:12:71:539:143:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:now, it will continue to be negative even after good news is announced, assuming that the news is not good
30:1120:80623:12:12:71:540:131:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:enough. Hence the expected return is negative following good news following paths with capital losses. On
30:1121:80728:12:12:71:540:119:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:the other hand, if the current gain is positive, it may still be positive and hence the expected return is
30:1122:80834:12:12:71:539:107:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:positive, even if the news is bad (but not too bad). Hence, because the path associated with the good news
30:1123:80940:12:12:71:539:95:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:had a capital loss and the path associated with the bad news had a capital gain, the expected return after
30:1124:81046:12:0:71:539:83:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:good news was lower than the expected return following bad news. While this is generally not the case, it
31:1125:81153:0:15:71:539:671:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:(or overreaction) in terms of subsequent price changes without being able to measure the
31:1126:81241:15:16:71:539:656:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:degree of underreaction (or overreaction) existing in the market at all times used for these
31:1127:81333:16:15:71:539:640:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:computations. Similarly, special cases of our model have underreaction at all times, but no
31:1128:81424:15:15:71:539:625:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:tendency for prices to converge to fundamental values. In these cases, there is not even the
31:1129:81516:15:19:71:438:610:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:positive autocorrelation that is typically associated with underreaction.
31:1130:81589:19:15:89:539:591:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Our assumptions are quite general, allowing the model’s analysis of a partial equilib-
31:1131:81675:15:15:71:539:576:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:rium for a single asset to be consistent with more comprehensive modeling of a multi-asset
31:1132:81765:15:15:71:539:561:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium. The process by which the market arrives at a fair value in an intertemporal
31:1133:81853:15:15:71:539:546:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:multi-asset economy can be quite complicated, but that is not our concern. We simply want
31:1134:81942:15:16:71:539:531:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:to understand as clearly and analytically as possible how a perturbation of investors’ demand
31:1135:82035:16:15:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:for a single stock, due to the disposition effect, generates deviations from the fully rational
31:1136:82130:15:15:71:540:500:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:equilibrium. Our “partial” equilibrium approach should not generate conclusions that differ
31:1137:82221:15:15:71:539:485:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:from those obtained by postulating utility functions and solving for demand functions over
31:1138:82311:15:15:71:540:470:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:multiple assets that optimize utility unless momentum strategies are true arbitrages that lack
31:1139:82405:15:15:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:risk. However, prior empirical evidence indicates that momentum strategies are quite risky.
31:1140:82496:15:16:71:539:440:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Moreover, we have found that the capital gains overhang of individual stocks is strongly
31:1141:82584:16:15:71:540:424:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:correlated with the cumulative past return ofa broad market index like S&P 500. Thus the
31:1142:82672:15:15:71:539:409:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:disposition components of demand across stocks are also likely to be positively correlated,
31:1143:82763:15:15:71:539:394:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:making the disposition effect a systematic risk to potential arbitrageurs. In short, we believe
31:1144:82858:15:15:71:539:379:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:that our approach, despite lacking a closedform solution for demand functions, does not
31:1145:82945:15:19:71:245:364:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:generate aberrational conclusions.
31:1146:82979:19:15:89:539:345:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Similarly, using what effectively are two representative agents is an oversimplification.
31:1147:83068:15:15:71:540:330:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:However, such a simplification is reasonable if aggregate demand generates effective aggregate
31:1148:83162:15:15:71:539:315:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference prices that are weighted averages of current prices and past aggregate reference
31:1149:83252:15:16:71:539:300:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:prices. While this aggregation cannot be done analytically, we have been quite general in
31:1150:83341:16:15:71:539:284:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:allowing weights for reference prices to time vary and be path dependent. With this level
31:1151:83430:15:15:71:539:269:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:of generality in reference price construction,we would be surprised if the two representative
31:1152:83523:15:19:71:387:254:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:agent paradigm used here does not hold up to closer scrutiny.
31:1153:83584:19:15:89:539:235:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:The generality of the reference price updating rule in the paper’s theoretical section is
31:1154:83673:15:15:71:539:220:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:both a strength and a weakness. Any attempt at defining an aggregate reference price for
31:1155:83761:15:15:71:539:205:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:empirical work requires a concrete updating weight, with little guidance from our theory.
31:1156:83850:15:15:71:539:190:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:Real-world equilibria, with multiple investors, requires aggregation of investors’ demand and
31:1157:83943:15:16:71:539:175:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference prices.  Our specification of the aggregate reference price for empirical work is
31:1158:84034:16:15:71:539:159:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:not the only solution to this problem. Whilewe have analyzed modest variations in the
31:1159:84119:15:15:71:539:144:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:reference price updating rule and found nothing to refute our conclusions, the exploration of
31:1160:84212:15:15:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:appropriate and alternative reference price rules is certainly an interesting avenue for future
