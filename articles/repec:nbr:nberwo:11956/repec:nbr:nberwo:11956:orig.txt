2:25:1146:28:27:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) imposed significant changes in the information
2:26:1240:27:27:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:about calories and nutrients that manufacturers of packaged foods must provide to consumers. This
2:27:1337:27:27:71:539:541:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:paper  tests  whether  the  release  of  this  information  impacted  body  weight  and  obesity  among
2:28:1440:27:27:71:539:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:American adults. We estimate the effect of the new label using a difference-in-differences method.
2:29:1538:27:26:71:539:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We compare the change before and after the implementation of NLEA in body weight among those
2:30:1630:26:27:71:539:461:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who use labels when food shopping to that among those who do not use labels. In National Health
2:31:1725:27:27:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Interview Survey data we find, among non-Hispanic white women, that the implementation of the
2:32:1818:27:27:71:539:407:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:new labels was associated with a decrease in body  weight  and the probability of obesity. Using
2:33:1914:27:27:71:539:380:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:NLEA regulatory impact analysis benchmarks, we estimate that the total monetary benefit of this
2:34:2009:27:27:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:decrease in body weight was $63 to $166 billion over a 20-year period, far in excess of the costs of
2:35:2109:27:27:71:123:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the NLEA.

3:51:2400:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) of 1990 represented the first comprehensive 
3:52:2492:28:27:72:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overhaul of the nation’s food labeling laws in over half a century.1  Prior to the NLEA, food 
3:53:2586:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:labeling was voluntary and labels were required only for products containing added nutrients or 
3:54:2682:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that made nutrition claims.  The NLEA, which took effect in 1994, made labeling mandatory for 
3:55:2776:28:27:72:541:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:most processed foods.  It requires manufacturers of packaged foods to display the Nutrition Facts 
3:56:2874:27:28:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:panel, which lists in a standardized format the amount of key macronutrients, vitamins, and 
3:57:2966:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:minerals contained per serving.  The NLEA also requires manufacturers to use specified serving 
3:58:3061:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sizes within product categories, declare nutrients as a percent of the recommended Daily Value, 
3:59:3157:28:28:71:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and use approved health and nutrient content claims (Food and Drug Administration, 1999).

3:61:3249:27:28:71:508:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This paper examines whether the nutrition labeling changes introduced by the NLEA have 
3:62:3336:28:27:71:515:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:impacted body weight and obesity among American adults.  The NLEA was motivated by a 
3:63:3421:27:28:71:540:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:growing body of scientific evidence linking dietary habits with obesity and chronic diseases such 
3:64:3519:28:28:71:498:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.  Two back-to-back reports 
3:65:3607:28:27:71:533:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:documenting such evidence—the 1988 Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health, and 
3:66:3696:27:28:71:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:Times:the 1989 National Research Council’s Diet and Health:  Implications for Reducing Chronic 
3:67:3785:28:27:71:522:239:144:Times:144:g_d0_f3:Disease Risk—provided impetus to the legislation.  In 1990, the year the NLEA was enacted, 
3:68:3876:27:28:71:490:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:voluntary labeling rules in existence were deemed seriously outdated with no nutrition 
3:69:3963:28:28:71:521:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:information appearing on at least 40 percent of packaged foods and the available information 
3:70:4056:28:27:71:500:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:“incomplete and misfocused,” according to a study commissioned by the Food and Drug 
3:71:4140:27:28:71:528:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) (Porter and Earl, 1990).  
3:72:4233:28:0:71:511:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The new labeling regulations were expected to help consumers choose more healthful diets 
4:73:4323:0:27:72:513:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:through improved access to credible nutrition information (Kurtzweil, 1993, 1994).  FDA’s 
4:74:4413:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimates of the health benefit from dietary changes triggered by the new labeling regulations 
4:75:4508:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ranged from $4.4 to $26.5 billion gained over 20 years.  The total cost of NLEA implementation, 
4:76:4604:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:including administrative and compliance costs, was projected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.3 
4:77:4701:28:28:72:299:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:billion (Food and Drug Administration, 1993).

4:79:4747:27:28:72:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The rising prevalence of obesity in the United States, however, has focused attention on the 
4:80:4840:28:27:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effectiveness of the NLEA labeling rules in improving health outcomes.  The Calorie Counts  
4:81:4932:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:report prepared by the FDA’s Obesity Working Group in 2004 notes that “Despite reports of a 
4:82:5024:28:28:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positive correlation between label use and certain positive dietary characteristics, the trend 
4:83:5119:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:toward obesity has accelerated over the past decade.”  Although obesity among Americans began 
4:84:5213:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to rise noticeably in the 1980s, its increase has continued unabated even after food labels were 
4:85:5310:28:27:72:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mandated by the NLEA.  Data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) suggests that 
4:86:5401:27:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:adult obesity has increased continuously since the NLEA enforcement, rising from 18% in1995 
4:87:5493:28:27:72:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to 23% in 2003.  Other health surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
4:88:5585:27:28:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Survey (NHANES) confirm this trend (Flegal et al., 2002).  Aggregate adult medical expenditure 
4:89:5680:28:28:72:512:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:attributable to obesity in 1998 has been estimated to range between $26.8 and $47.5 billion

4:94:5996:28:28:72:512:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mandatory nutrition labels introduced by the NLEA on the body weight and obesity among 
4:95:6083:28:0:72:523:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Americans?  Surprisingly, despite being of considerable public policy interest, there has been 
5:96:6179:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:little empirical research on this question.  The interest in better understanding the effect of food 
5:97:6280:27:28:72:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:labeling on obesity and other dietary outcomes is not confined to the U.S.  The World Health

5:99:6473:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a way to meet the consumers’ need for accurate, standardized and comprehensible information in 
5:100:6568:28:28:72:491:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:order to make healthy food choices.  A growing number of countries are implementing 
5:101:6652:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mandatory nutrition labeling regulations to achieve the public health goal of reducing obesity 
5:102:6747:27:28:72:306:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and preventing chronic disease (Hawkes, 2004).

5:108:7175:28:27:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the estimates.  In section 5, we calculate the 
5:109:7273:27:28:72:509:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dollar value of the BMI reductions due to the NLEA and conclude with a discussion of the

6:135:9171:27:28:72:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:indicated that consumers acquired and comprehended more nutrition information following the 
6:136:9263:28:28:72:521:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:introduction of the new labels.  Relatively more information was acquired about nutritionally 
6:137:9357:28:27:72:523:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unhealthy products compared with healthy products, suggesting that labels may have a public

6:141:9724:28:28:72:532:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consumers registered greater label search intensity in the post-NLEA period compared with the

7:156:10456:27:28:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Thus, much of the benefit from the NLEA was expected to occur when consumers read the labels

10:233:15779:28:27:71:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:NHIS to be pre-NLEA data, and the 1995 and 1998 waves to be post-NLEA.  Compared with 
10:234:15865:27:28:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:previous studies such as Moorman (1996), the four NHIS samples provide a broader span of time 
10:235:15959:28:27:72:531:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:around NLEA’s implementation to assess its impact.  The 1993 and 1995 samples provide data 
10:236:16050:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:immediately prior to and following the NLEA and the 1991 and 1998 samples provide data more 
10:237:16142:28:28:71:524:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:separated from the event.  Our main empirical estimates are derived from pooled data with an 
10:238:16235:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:indicator for pre-NLEA and post-NLEA periods.  Unlike previous studies, the large sample size 
10:239:16329:27:28:72:496:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:provided by the NHIS enables us to conduct analysis by race/gender subgroups.  This is 
10:240:16416:28:27:72:494:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:particularly important since weight outcomes have a significant genetic component and 
10:241:16502:27:28:72:516:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cultural/gender factors exert a strong influence on weight-related behaviors (Cawley, 2004).

11:243:16596:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In addition to the five categories of frequency of label use (“Always” to “Never”), respondents 
11:244:16692:27:28:71:516:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were given a sixth option of “Don’t buy food.”  Those who don’t buy food are neither in the 
11:245:16784:28:27:71:539:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:treatment nor control group and so we exclude them from our main models.  (After discussion of 
11:246:16879:27:28:71:519:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our primary results, we explain how our results change if we include these individuals in our 
11:247:16973:28:28:71:121:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sample.)

11:249:16984:27:28:71:530:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 1 reports the proportions of the population who report reading labels when buying food.  
11:250:17079:28:27:71:531:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Estimates for pre- and post-NLEA periods as well as 1991 and 1998 are presented, both for the 
11:251:17173:27:28:71:520:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overall adult population and broken down by race/gender groups.  Overall label use is steady 
11:252:17266:28:28:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over the pre- and post NLEA periods at 67%, although there is slight increase of 0.7 percentage-
11:253:17362:28:27:71:530:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:points going from 1991 to 1998.  In the way of comparison, using a similar label use definition 
11:254:17458:27:28:71:528:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as ours, FDA’s Health and Diet Survey registered 70% label use in 1994 and 69% in 1995 and 
11:255:17549:28:27:71:537:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2002 (FDA, 2004).  In short, the NLEA does not seem to have altered the percent of people who 
11:256:17643:27:28:71:124:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:use labels.

11:258:17655:27:28:71:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The proportion of those who report that they don’t buy food rises from 4% in 1991 to 8.5% in 
11:259:17748:28:28:71:519:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1998.  A greater proportion of men than women report not buying food.  For example, in the 
11:260:17839:28:27:71:512:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:post-NLEA period, 11.8% of white men report not buying food compared to 2.1% of white 
11:261:17925:27:28:71:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:women.  In absolute terms, the increase in not buying food is mainly among men, although the 
11:262:18018:28:27:71:518:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:proportion of women not buying food also increased from 1991 to 1998.  One reason for the 
11:263:18108:27:28:71:523:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in the proportion of those who don’t buy food could be an increase in the number of  
11:264:18202:28:28:71:275:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:individuals almost exclusively dining out.

12:267:18271:27:28:72:506:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We used Body Mass Index or BMI (ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of height in 
12:268:18359:28:27:72:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:meters) as our primary outcome measure for estimating the impact of the new label on body 
12:269:18449:27:28:72:487:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight.  BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight.  In 1998 NHIS, all 
12:270:18534:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:respondents personally reported their height and weight.  In the NHIS for 1991, 1993, and 1995, 
12:271:18630:28:27:72:527:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:height and weight were provided mostly by respondents, but in some cases proxy reports were 
12:272:18722:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:used.  NHIS provides a flag for proxy-reported height and weight and we excluded all such cases 
12:273:18818:28:27:72:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from our analysis.  Since the onset of the health effects of excess body weight are especially 
12:274:18913:27:28:71:539:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:linked to when a person is obese, we used an indicator for obesity status, defined as BMI ≥30, as 
12:275:19011:28:28:71:227:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:an additional outcome measure.

12:278:19137:28:27:71:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In general, both the mean BMI and the prevalence of obesity have increased over the pre- and 
12:279:19230:27:28:71:519:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:post-NLEA period.  Obesity is highest at around 30% among black women.  Although white 
12:280:19317:28:27:71:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:women have the lowest obesity, they recorded a higher rate of increase both in the pooled and 
12:281:19411:27:28:71:374:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:yearly pre- and post-NLEA data compared with black women.

12:284:19486:27:28:71:520:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The goal of our empirical analysis is to estimate NLEA’s impact by comparing the change in 
12:285:19577:28:27:71:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:body weight of label users over the pre/post-NLEA period with the change in body weight of 
12:286:19668:27:28:71:527:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:label nonusers over the same period.  NHIS respondents are not randomized into the treatment 
12:287:19761:28:28:71:495:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:group (label users) or control group (label nonusers); they self-select into these groups.  
12:288:19853:28:0:71:541:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Therefore, label users and nonusers are likely to have different characteristics, and it is important 
13:289:19957:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to control for these differences.  Previous research suggests that income, education, age, gender, 
13:290:20056:27:28:72:508:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:household size and urban residence have significant influence on label use behavior (Kim, 
13:291:20146:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Nayga, and Capps, 2000; Neuhouser, Kristal, and Patterson, 1999).  Table 3 lists these, as well as 
13:292:20245:27:28:72:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:several additional sociodemographic and health characteristics that are included as controls in 
13:293:20341:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our models.  There are some notable differences between the pre- and post-NLEA samples, 
13:294:20429:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which confirms the need to control for these variables in our empirical models.  Distribution of 
13:295:20526:27:28:72:488:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:family income has shifted lower in the post-NLEA period.  The NHIS provides only a 
13:296:20609:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:categorical income measure.  The original measure has a significant number of missing values.  
13:297:20704:27:28:72:513:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:NHIS data files include separate family income files which replace the missing values with 
13:298:20795:28:28:72:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imputed incomes.  We used these income measures in our analysis.  For 1998, family income 
13:299:20885:28:27:72:484:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was imputed using a multiple imputation procedure.  We took this into account using 
13:300:20969:27:28:72:271:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:SUDAAN’s multiple imputation option.

13:302:21007:27:28:72:516:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In 1993 and 1995, the supplementary questionnaires containing the label use questions were 
13:303:21098:28:27:72:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:administered to only half the sample of adults.  In 1995, these adults were distributed evenly 
13:304:21193:27:28:72:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:throughout the year.  However, in 1993, the half sample consisted of adults interviewed in the 
13:305:21288:28:28:72:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:second half of the year.  This is reflected in the higher proportion individuals in the 3rd and 4th 
13:306:21387:28:27:72:515:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:quarters in the pre-NLEA sample (table 3).  Any seasonality introduced by this is taken into 
13:307:21480:27:28:72:370:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:account by including quarter dummy variables in our models.

13:309:21540:27:28:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We included several covariates to account for possible differences and changes in health status, 
13:310:21637:28:28:72:541:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:health behavior, and health attitudes.  Health condition and health preferences were controlled by 
13:311:21736:28:0:72:532:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:including self-assessed health status, number of days bedridden in the past 12 months, smoking 
14:312:21833:0:27:72:539:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:status, and a variable indicating the frequency of adding salt to food at the table.  Preferences for 
14:313:21935:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight were proxied using indicators for individual’s current action regarding his or her body 
14:314:22030:28:27:72:449:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight (e.g. trying to lose weight, trying to gain weight, not doing anything).

14:320:22328:35:27:71:534:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for sociodemographic or health characteristics (we will later present estimates from models that 
14:321:22425:27:28:71:517:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:do control for those characteristics).  The upper panel presents results based on BMI and the 
14:322:22519:28:27:71:511:426:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bottom panel gives results based on percent obese.  Estimates were obtained for the overall 
14:323:22611:27:28:71:535:399:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:population and for four major non-Hispanic race/gender subgroups.  In all cases, label users had 
14:324:22708:28:28:71:525:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:greater body weight compared with label nonusers in the pre-NLEA period.  For example, the 
14:325:22799:28:27:71:539:343:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1991-93 obesity prevalence in the population overall was 17.07% among label users and 14.51% 
14:326:22892:27:28:71:533:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:among label nonusers.  With the exception of white women, this pattern held in the post-NLEA 
14:327:22985:28:27:71:535:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period as well.  This is likely because, at any given time, heavier persons may be using labels in 
14:328:23084:27:28:71:541:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their attempt to lose weight.  For this reason, differences in weight status between label users and 
14:329:23185:28:28:71:535:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nonusers at any given time cannot be used to draw inference on the efficacy of the labels.  What 
14:330:23282:28:27:71:534:205:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we are interested is in the change in weight status of label users and nonusers and the difference 
14:331:23381:27:28:71:509:178:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between these changes.  These estimates are reported, respectively, in columns 3, 6, and 7.

14:333:23473:27:28:71:532:123:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Column 3 estimates in table 4 show that in most cases, the body weight of label users increased 
14:334:23569:28:0:71:539:95:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significantly from the pre-NLEA period to the post-NLEA period.  Thus, clearly the effect of the 
15:335:23668:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:new labels hasn’t been forceful enough to reverse the trend of rising obesity.  However, besides 
15:336:23765:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:label information, many other economic and social factors influence body weight.  Changes in 
15:337:23858:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these factors could mask any potential label effect.  Since these factors affect label nonusers as 
15:338:23957:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:well, an estimate of their effect on body weight is given by the difference in weight of label 
15:339:24052:28:28:71:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nonusers across the pre- and post-NLEA periods.  These estimates reported in column 6 show 
15:340:24143:28:27:71:541:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that, with the exception of black men, body weights of label nonusers also increased significantly 
15:341:24242:27:28:71:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from the pre-NLEA to the post-NLEA period.  Column 7 reports the DD label effect, that is, the 
15:342:24337:28:27:71:497:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change in weight of label users relative to that of label nonusers.  With non-label effects 
15:343:24429:27:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:removed, the body weight of the overall population of label users actually fell in the post-NLEA 
15:344:24526:28:28:71:528:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period, as measured both by the mean BMI and by percent obese.  However, breakdown of the 
15:345:24616:28:27:71:531:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:label effect by race/gender groups reveals great disparity.  The largest beneficial label effect on 
15:346:24716:27:28:72:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:body weight is for non-Hispanic white women.  With the introduction of the new labels, there 
15:347:24809:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was a net reduction of 0.52 kg/m2 in their BMI and a 3.36 percentage-points reduction in obesity.  
15:348:24908:27:28:71:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Obesity declined among black women as well, by nearly 5 percentage points, although the 
15:349:24996:28:28:71:542:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:decline in their BMI wasn’t statistically significant.  New labels had no effect on the body weight 
15:350:25096:28:27:71:531:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of white men.  For black men, we get a seemingly anomalous result: introduction of new labels 
15:351:25190:27:28:71:529:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:actually increased their body weight.  However, before reading too much into these results, we 
15:352:25285:28:27:71:528:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have to account for the possibility that the results could be due to selection bias—difference in 
15:353:25383:27:28:71:498:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sociodemographic characteristics between label users and nonusers.  To control for such 
15:354:25471:28:28:71:374:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences, we adopt the regression framework in equation 2.

16:359:25642:27:28:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variable.  We estimated two regression models, one with a limited covariate specification that 
16:360:25737:28:27:72:505:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:included only the sociodemographic characteristics and a second one with a full covariate 
16:361:25827:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specification that included the sociodemographic characteristics plus the health characteristics.  
16:362:25926:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:These health characteristics are endogenous.  For example, some individuals may smoke because 
16:363:26020:28:27:72:505:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:smoking acts as an appetite suppressant and thus help them to reduce their weight.  Those 
16:364:26110:27:28:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reported to be in excellent health may be so because of lower body weight.  And those trying to 
16:365:26206:28:27:72:523:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lose weight are likely to do so because they perceive themselves to be overweight.  However, 
16:366:26299:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these variables are also likely to capture individuals’ preference for health and attitudes toward 
16:367:26398:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:body weight that may affect their current weight and change in weight over time.  Therefore, we 
16:368:26494:28:27:72:382:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimated a separate model with these health variables included. 
16:369:26559:27:28:72:75:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
16:370:26559:28:27:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In both the limited and full models, characteristics were allowed to have period-specific effects 
16:371:26657:27:28:72:517:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on BMI through interactions between the pre/post-NLEA indicator and the covariates.  Both 
16:372:26747:28:28:72:533:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:models were estimated for the overall population and by non-Hispanic race/gender groups.  For 
16:373:26841:28:32:72:499:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:brevity, only the estimated label effects—that is, the coefficient of the iLABEL*iNLEA 
16:374:26927:32:31:71:219:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interaction, lδ—are reported.

16:376:26957:28:27:71:515:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The results are fairly clear.  Non-Hispanic white women benefited from the new food labels 
16:377:27048:27:28:71:536:176:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:introduced by the NLEA.  Based on the estimate from the full covariate specification, their BMI 
16:378:27144:28:28:71:542:148:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on average is 0.3 kg/m2 lower than it would have been without the new labels.  The label effect is 
16:379:27243:28:27:72:510:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:insignificantly different from zero for the rest of the race/gender groups and for the overall 
16:380:27338:27:0:72:517:93:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:population, under the full covariate specification.  For black men, the anomalous increase in 
17:381:27434:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight is observed—but only in the limited covariate specification.  With health variables 
17:382:27525:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:included under the full covariate specification, the magnitude of the label effect for black men is 
17:383:27625:28:27:72:398:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reduced nearly by half and the estimate is statistically insignificant. 
17:384:27697:27:28:72:75:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
17:385:27697:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The inclusion of health variables in the model adds considerable explanatory power to the BMI 
17:386:27791:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regressions; in some cases the R2s triple.  The effects of covariates are along the expected lines 
17:387:27890:27:28:71:500:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(estimates not reported here but are available from the authors).  Based on the regression 
17:388:27981:28:27:71:531:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate for the overall population, ceteris paribus, smokers have significantly lower BMI than 
17:389:28077:27:28:71:536:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-smokers.  Those reported to be in excellent or very good health have, on average, 1.5 kg/m2 
17:390:28172:28:28:71:540:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lower BMI compared with those in fair or poor health.  Those who are trying to lose weight have 
17:391:28268:28:27:71:505:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3.5 kg/m2 higher BMI and those who are trying to gain weight have 3.7 kg/m2 lower BMI 
17:392:28354:27:28:72:531:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:compared with those who are trying to stay the same or not doing anything about their weight.  
17:393:28449:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:All the included sociodemographic variables have significant correlations with the BMI.  BMI is 
17:394:28545:27:28:72:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positively related to age and negatively to family income and individual’s education level.

17:398:28827:28:27:72:530:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentage points by multiplying by 100).  Results from logistic regressions were similar.  The 
17:399:28923:27:28:72:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:obesity regressions lead to the same conclusions as the BMI regressions:  Non-Hispanic white 
17:400:29016:28:28:72:485:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:women benefited from the introduction of the new labels.  Based on the full covariate 
17:401:29102:28:27:72:522:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specification, obesity prevalence among white women is 2.36 percentage-points lower than it 
17:402:29194:27:28:72:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:would have been without the new labels.  The labels have a statistically insignificant effect on 
17:403:29291:28:0:72:520:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:obesity prevalence among the other race/gender groups and for the population overall.  Once 
18:404:29385:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again, labels seem to be associated with an increase in obesity among black men, but this effect 
18:405:29482:27:28:72:235:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is insignificant in the full model.

18:407:29519:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Both the basic and regression results discussed so far were from samples that excluded adults 
18:408:29613:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:who responded “Don’t buy food” to the label use question.  We reestimated the BMI and obesity 
18:409:29707:28:27:72:541:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regressions models reported in tables 5 and 6 with these individuals included in the label nonuser 
18:410:29806:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:category.  The results were similar, with a consistent beneficial effect found for non-Hispanic 
18:411:29902:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white women.  The results were very stable under the limited covariate specification—label 
18:412:29993:27:28:72:486:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect on BMI was –0.4 for white women, the same as in table 5.  In the full covariate 
18:413:30080:28:28:72:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specification, the estimates were slightly lower and less precise.  This instability is surprising 
18:414:30179:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:given that among white women, those who don’t buy food constitute a very small fraction, 2.1% 
18:415:30273:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the post-NLEA period.  This suggests that non-food-buyers are a special group that should be 
18:416:30369:28:27:72:495:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:excluded from the comparison group as was done for models reported in tables 5 and 6.

18:419:30488:27:28:72:517:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A key assumption in interpreting the DD regression results is that the label effects estimated 
18:420:30583:28:28:72:542:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:across the pre-/post-NLEA periods are due to the enforcement of mandatory labeling in 1994 and 
18:421:30678:28:27:72:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:not due to an underlying trend in weight change that already existed before the introduction of 
18:422:30774:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the new labels.  With two years of pre-NLEA data (1991 and 1993) and two years of post-NLEA 
18:423:30866:28:27:72:516:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data (1995 and 1998), we can test this assumption.  Table 7 reports DD label effects for non-
18:424:30959:27:28:72:522:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Hispanic white women estimated across different time periods.  The key results appear in the 
18:425:31052:28:28:72:523:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:first row.  This row gives the change in BMI and obesity due to label use from 1991 to 1993.  
18:426:31146:28:0:72:528:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The unadjusted results are positive and significant while the covariate-adjusted effects are also 
19:427:31246:0:27:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positive but not significantly different from zero.  This suggests that there was no pre-existing 
19:428:31344:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trend in the weights of white women label users compared with white women label nonusers.  If 
19:429:31438:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:anything, the underlying trend for label users relative to label nonusers in the pre-NLEA was of 
19:430:31535:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight gain rather than weight loss.  This trend reversed sharply in the post-NLEA period, as the 
19:431:31633:28:28:72:497:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rest of the results in table 7 show.  Between 1993 and 1995, the label effect resulted in a 
19:432:31725:28:27:72:513:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reduction of 0.45 kg/m2 of BMI among non-Hispanic white women.  Comparing 1993 with 
19:433:31809:27:28:71:281:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1998, obesity fell by 3.2 percentage points.

19:436:31886:28:28:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The results with obesity as the dependent variable show that label effects for non-Hispanic white 
19:437:31984:28:27:71:532:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:women occur at parts of the BMI distribution that matter most for health outcomes—those who 
19:438:32076:27:28:71:528:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are heaviest.  To illustrate this more clearly, we estimated the basic DD label effects at various 
19:439:32175:28:27:71:510:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:points along the BMI distribution.  Table 8 reports these results, which are not adjusted for 
19:440:32269:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:covariates.  The label effect at the median, -0.5 BMI units, is essentially the same as at the mean 
19:441:32369:28:28:71:527:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(-0.52) reported in Table 4.  The label effects, however, are larger at the upper end of the BMI 
19:442:32466:28:27:71:510:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution than at the lower end, as the estimates charted in Figure 1 clearly show.  These 
19:443:32560:27:28:71:537:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:results confirm that the benefits of the label are concentrated among non-Hispanic white women

19:448:32799:27:28:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:new labels to be between $4.4 and $26.5, realized over 20 years (Food and Drug Administration, 
19:449:32894:28:0:71:517:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1993).  This estimate can be put in perspective given our finding of a beneficial effect of the 
20:450:32992:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:label for non-Hispanic white women.  We translate our estimate of the average reduction in BMI 
20:451:33087:27:28:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of white women due to the new label into dollar terms using four sources of potential benefits 
20:452:33182:28:27:71:538:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from the BMI reduction: lower mortality risk, lower medical expenditures, reduced absenteeism, 
20:453:33277:27:28:71:507:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and increased productivity.3  Estimates of the implied marginal benefit from these sources 
20:454:33368:28:28:72:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:associated with a reduction in one unit of BMI are obtained from published sources.  We then 
20:455:33461:28:27:72:504:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:assess the per-person value of the benefit attributable to the new label using our preferred 
20:456:33554:27:28:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate of the BMI reduction of 0.3 due to the NLEA (table 5).  For each source, this estimate is 
20:457:33653:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:then multiplied by the number of non-Hispanic white female label users to get the total benefit 
20:458:33749:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:attributable to the new label from that source.  The number of non-Hispanic white women label 
20:459:33843:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:users is estimated by multiplying the census estimate of white women in 1994 (the year of NLEA 
20:460:33938:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:implementation) by 0.75, the average fraction of white women label users in our data.  Finally, 
20:461:34034:27:28:72:505:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the benefits from all four sources are summed to obtain the total benefits from the NLEA.

20:463:34124:27:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 9 reports our monetary benefit estimates.  The estimate for the reduction in mortality risk 
20:464:34222:28:28:72:535:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:associated with lower BMI is from Calle et. al. (1999).  They report age-adjusted death rates for 
20:465:34320:28:27:72:529:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white females at different BMI ranges.  Based on overweight prevalence estimates reported by 
20:466:34413:27:28:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Flegal et al. (1998) using the 1988-94 NHANES data, we assume that the median non-Hispanic 
20:467:34504:28:27:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white female BMI in 1994 to be in the 23.5-24.9 range.  From Calle et al., the implied marginal 
20:468:34600:27:28:72:530:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reduction in death risk for a 1-unit decline in BMI for white women from this range to the next 
20:469:34696:28:28:72:529:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lower category is 0.0133 percentage points.  Using FDA’s (Zarkin et. al., 1993) estimate of the 
20:470:34792:28:27:72:539:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value of statistical life in 1988 dollars ($1.5 million), the 0.3-unit BMI decline resulting from the 
20:471:34894:27:28:72:538:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:NLEA has a monetary benefit of $60 per white female label user.4  Across all white female label 
20:472:34990:28:0:71:537:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:users, this implies that the reduction in mortality associated with the NLEA is worth $4.4 billion 
21:473:35091:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:per year.  In its final regulatory impact analysis for the NLEA, FDA reported the value of health 
21:474:35189:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:benefits gained over a twenty-year period, in 1991 dollars, using a 5-percent discount rate.  In the 
21:475:35290:28:27:72:521:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:final column of table 9, we report comparable figures for each source of health benefits.  The 
21:476:35385:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimated value of benefits from mortality risk reduction associated with label use among non-
21:477:35479:28:28:72:323:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Hispanic white women over 20 years is $63 billion.

21:480:35620:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:benefits of about $23 billion from reduced medical expenditure (based on estimates for females 
21:481:35715:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, and Wang, 2003), $ 8 billion from lower absenteeism (based on 
21:482:35807:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimates for females Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, and Wang, 2005), and $71 billion from increased 
21:483:35902:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:productivity (based on estimates for white females from Cawley, 2004).5  Including mortality, 
21:484:35996:27:28:71:532:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the total benefits from the NLEA gained over a 20-year period is $166 billion (in 1991 dollars), 
21:485:36093:28:27:71:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which is far higher than the upper limit of  both the costs ($2.3 billion) and the benefits ($26.5 
21:486:36192:27:28:71:534:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:billion) projected by the FDA.  If mortality benefits are excluded, the benefits over 20-years are 
21:487:36291:28:28:71:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:$102 billion.  Based our estimates, therefore, the costs of the NLEA are far exceeded by the 
21:488:36384:28:27:72:500:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:benefits associated with the reduction in the body weight of non-Hispanic white women.

21:491:36482:27:28:72:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), enacted in 1990 and enforced since 1994, 
21:492:36572:28:28:72:498:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:represented the first comprehensive overhaul of U.S. food labeling laws in 50 years.  By 
21:493:36661:28:27:71:516:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:providing access to consistent, standardized, and credible nutrition information, the law was 
21:494:36755:27:28:72:512:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:expected to help consumers choose more healthful foods and thereby promote better health 
21:495:36844:28:0:72:530:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outcomes.  FDA estimated the value of health benefits from new labels to be between $4.4 and 
22:496:36939:0:27:72:497:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:$26.5 billion, realized over 20 years. The total cost of NLEA implementation, including 
22:497:37027:27:28:72:531:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:administrative and compliance costs, was projected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion.

22:499:37123:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To date, there has been little evaluation of NLEA impact dietary and health outcomes among 
22:500:37214:28:28:72:509:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Americans.  Using a unique set of pre- and post-NLEA data on the label use habits of U.S. 
22:501:37304:28:27:72:536:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:adults, this paper examined whether mandatory labeling introduced by the NLEA had an impact 
22:502:37396:27:28:72:529:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on body weight.   The findings indicate that the NLEA labels had a beneficial impact, but only 
22:503:37491:28:27:72:497:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for one demographic group—non-Hispanic white females.  As a result of the new labels 
22:504:37576:27:28:72:522:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:introduced by the NLEA, the BMI and probability of obesity among white female label users 
22:505:37666:28:28:72:531:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were significantly lower than they would have been in the absence of the new labels.  The total 
22:506:37762:28:27:72:531:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:monetary benefit due to lower mortality, reduced medical expenditures, declining absenteeism, 
22:507:37856:27:28:72:520:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and increased productivity associated with this reduction in body weight was estimated to be 
22:508:37949:28:27:72:342:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about $166 billion (1991 dollars) over a 20-year period.

22:510:38006:28:27:72:540:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our estimates have significant implications for nutrition labeling initiatives in the U.S. and at the 
22:511:38108:27:28:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:international level.  One important implication is that label benefits may be limited to certain 
22:512:38205:28:28:72:519:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:demographic groups.  Future research should investigate why most groups in the U.S. do not 
22:513:38296:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:seem to benefit (at least in terms of body weight) from these regulations.  A second implication 
22:514:38393:27:28:72:527:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is that our assessment of the benefits of the mandatory labeling initiative in the U.S. may offer 
22:515:38491:28:27:72:402:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:guidance for similar initiatives being considered by other countries.

22:517:38562:28:28:72:512:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our study has some limitations.  First, it is based on non-experimental data.  If our controls 
22:518:38657:28:0:72:491:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(which include time-varying effects of education, income, marital status, health, health 
23:519:38748:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:behaviors, and dieting attempts) do not adequately capture how self-selection among label users 
23:520:38844:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:may have changed over time, our estimates could be biased.  However, examining the stability of 
23:521:38940:28:27:72:530:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our results against two sources of such bias—the changing effects of unobservables using their 
23:522:39035:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observable correlates and testing for the existence of an underlying trend in the body weight of 
23:523:39132:28:28:72:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:label users and nonusers in years prior to NLEA—suggests that any bias is likely to be small.  
23:524:39227:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Second, there may be additional benefits due to dietary changes associated with the increased 
23:525:39321:27:28:72:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply of healthier foods from industry reformulation of foods following the NLEA.  Such

23:527:39506:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:due to substitutions among foods that may result from the release of new nutrition information

24:535:39891:14:14:108:528:612:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nutrition labels that predate the NLEA on dietary outcomes, and on NLEA’s impact on

24:539:40093:13:14:89:526:557:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3. FDA’s benefits estimates were based on the number of life-years gained due to dietary 
24:540:40181:14:14:108:519:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes triggered by the new label.  Specifically, the benefits were assumed to result 
24:541:40268:14:14:108:536:529:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from lower intakes of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol and the associated reduction

24:543:40449:14:13:108:542:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:result for benefits from the reduction in mortality risk is the one most comparable to FDA

24:547:40640:14:14:107:483:446:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:median BMI in the 23.5-24.9 range for non-Hispanic white women in 1994 is 
24:548:40714:14:13:107:521:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conservative.  If median BMI in the 25.0-26.4 is assumed, the per-person value of the 
24:549:40800:13:14:107:410:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:implied marginal reduction in mortality risk increases to $162.
