2:23:856:30:24:72:540:594:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:U.S. Presidential Executive Order 13141 commits the United States to a "careful assessment and
2:24:950:24:24:72:540:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consideration  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  trade  agreements."  The  most  direct  mechanism
2:25:1051:24:24:71:540:546:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:through which trade liberalization would affect environmental quality in the U.S. is through changes
2:26:1151:24:24:71:539:522:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in  the  composition  of  industries.  Freer  trade  means  greater  specialization,  increasing  the
2:27:1252:24:24:71:539:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:concentration of polluting industries in some countries and decreasing it in others. Indeed, in this
2:28:1352:24:24:71:539:474:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:paper we predict a substantial reduction in U.S. pollution from 1978-94 due entirely to a shift in the
2:29:1454:24:24:71:539:450:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:composition of U.S. manufacturing toward cleaner industries. We then use annual industry-level
2:30:1548:24:24:71:540:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:data  on  imports  to  the  U.S.  to  examine  whether  this  compositional  shift  can  be  traced  to  the
2:31:1656:24:24:71:539:402:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant trade liberalization that occurred over the same time period; we conclude that no such
2:32:1754:24:24:71:539:378:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:connection exists. First, we find that a shift toward cleaner industries, similar to that observed in
2:33:1855:24:24:71:539:354:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:U.S.  manufacturing,  has  also  occurred  among  U.S.  imports.  Second,  we  find  no  evidence  that
2:34:1958:24:24:71:539:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pollution-intensive industries have been disproportionately affected by the tariff changes over that
2:35:2058:24:32:71:129:306:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time period.

3:57:2487:28:27:72:152:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1. Introduction 
3:58:2503:27:28:72:546:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  In  recent  decades,  while  U.S.  manufacturing  output  increased,  total  pollution  from  
3:59:2599:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturers declined.  Much of the decline has been due to a large shift in the composition of 
3:60:2696:28:27:72:548:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  U.S.  manufacturing  sector  away  from  polluting  industries  and  toward  cleaner  industries.    
3:61:2802:27:28:72:547:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:During  the  same  period,  U.S.  tariffs  on  imported  manufactured  goods  declined.    These  
3:62:2900:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concurrent  trends  have  led  many  to  conclude  that  trade  liberalization  –  “globalization”  –  has  
3:63:3008:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:caused  the  shift  in  U.S.  manufacturing  to  clean  industries,  at  the  expense  of  environmental  
3:64:3114:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:quality  in  developing  countries.    In  this  paper  we  seek  empirical  support  for  that  claim,  using  
3:65:3226:28:27:72:547:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data  on  tariffs,  U.S.  imports,  pollution  abatement  costs,  and  industries’  relative  pollution  
3:66:3331:27:28:72:127:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intensities. 
3:67:3344:28:27:72:546:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  This  concern,  that  trade  liberalization  leads  to  a  transfer  of  polluting  industries  to  
3:68:3446:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:developing  countries,  has  been  part  of  the  impetus  for  widespread  protests  against  the  World  
3:69:3553:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Trade Organization.  It has been the motivation for environmental addenda to trade agreements 
3:70:3647:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and it is the subject of President 
3:71:3739:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Clinton’s  Executive  Order  13141,  “Environmental  Review  of  Trade  Agreements.”    EO13141  
3:72:3836:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:requires that the United States “factor  environmental  considerations into ... its trade negotiating 
3:73:3938:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:objectives,”  and  that  the  United  States  Trade  Representative  and  the  Chair  of  the  Council  on  
3:74:4046:28:27:72:523:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Environmental Quality oversee analyses of the “environmental impacts of trade agreements.” 
3:75:4137:27:28:72:553:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:     Trade     liberalization     can     affect     the     environment     via     several     mechanisms:     
3:76:4250:28:28:72:545:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interjurisdictional  competition  to  lower  standards,  transfer  of  pollution  abatement  technology,  
3:77:4356:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cross-border spillovers, changes to the overall scale of economies, etc.  But it seems to us that the 
4:78:4459:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:most direct effect of trade liberalization on the environment would be through the composition of 
4:79:4557:27:28:72:546:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries.    Trade  liberalization  leads  to  specialization,  and  countries  that  specialize  in  less  
4:80:4667:28:27:72:354:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution-intensive goods will have cleaner environments. 
4:81:4725:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  In  this  paper  we  assess  the  degree  to  which  the  reduction  of  U.S.  tariffs  on  imported  
4:82:4829:28:28:72:547:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:goods  accounts  for  the  changing  composition  of  U.S.  manufacturing  toward  cleaner  industries.    
4:83:4936:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We do this in three ways.  First, in section 2 of the paper, we examine the pollution content of 
4:84:5033:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.S.  manufactured  goods,  imports,  and  exports,  in  the  spirit  of  Kahn  (2003),  to  see  whether  
4:85:5140:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports have replaced the pollution-intensive goods no longer produced in the U.S.  Second, in 
4:86:5235:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:section 3 of the paper, we use a regression approach, similar to Grossman and Krueger (1993), to 
4:87:5332:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:see  whether  the  tariff  reductions  of  the  past  several  decades  have  exacerbated  the  “pollution  
4:88:5440:28:27:71:545:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:haven”  effect.    If  this  is  the  case,  then  broad-based  tariff  reductions  could  have  caused  the  
4:89:5550:27:28:72:545:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:compositional  shift  observed  in  the  data.    Finally,  in  section  4  of  the  paper,  we  investigate  
4:90:5660:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether the compositional shift in U.S. industries could be due to asymmetric trade liberalization 
4:91:5759:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(i.e., larger U.S. tariff reductions in the more pollution-intensive industries).  Specifically, we use 
4:92:5863:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our  regression  coefficients  to  predict  the  changes  in  the  composition  of  U.S.  industries  that  are  
4:93:5976:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:due  to  past  tariff  reductions  (as  well  as  the  changes  that  would  be  the  result  of  setting  current  
4:94:6092:28:28:72:173:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tariff levels to zero). 
4:95:6116:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our basic conclusion is that tariff reductions over the past several decades cannot account 
4:96:6208:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for  the  change  in  the  composition  of  U.S.  manufacturing  toward  cleaner  industries.    First,  
4:97:6313:28:27:72:547:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports  from  other  countries  do  not  appear  to  have  replaced  the  domestic  production  of  
4:98:6414:27:28:72:545:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution-intensive  goods  in  the  U.S.    Second,  we  find  no  evidence  that  pollution-intensive  
4:99:6519:28:0:72:543:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries are disproportionately sensitive to tariff reductions.  (In fact, just the opposite appears 
5:100:6623:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:likely.)    Finally,  while  it  is  true  that  tariff  reductions  have  been  greater  for  polluting  industries,  
5:101:6742:27:28:72:477:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that difference explains only a small part of the overall shift in U.S. manufacturing.  
5:102:6830:28:27:72:75:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
5:103:6830:27:28:72:317:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:2.  The pollution content of U.S. manufacturing 
5:104:6877:28:28:72:547:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:   The   various   effects   of   trade   on   environmental   quality   can   be   divided   into   three   
5:105:6986:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:components: first, how trade affects the overall scale of the economy; second, how trade affects 
5:106:7083:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the techniques  of  production,  and  third,  how  trade  affects  the  composition  of  industries.    The  
5:107:7192:28:27:72:546:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:various  parties  concerned  about  trade  liberalization’s  effect  on  the  environment  appear  to  
5:108:7295:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentrate  on  the  composition effect:  specifically,  the  concern  that  trade  liberalization  will  
5:109:7401:28:28:72:549:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:result  in  the  creation  of  pollution  havens  (countries  that  specialize  in  polluting  industries).    
5:110:7512:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Hence  we  begin  by  examining  the  degree  to  which  the  composition  of  U.S.  manufacturing  has  
5:111:7617:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shifted towards clean industries, and how much of that shift can be explained by changes in the 
5:112:7713:28:27:72:249:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition of imports and exports. 
5:113:7749:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In order to isolate this composition effect, we need a metric with which to label various 
5:114:7839:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries  as  being  relatively  “clean”  or  “dirty.”    To  that  end,  we  rely  on  the  World  Bank’s  
5:115:7949:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:“Industrial  Pollution  Projection  System”  (IPPS).1    The  IPPS  reports  the  amount  of  each  of  14  
5:116:8057:28:28:71:544:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollutants,  in  pounds  per  million  dollars  of  value  added,  that  are  generated  from  each  of  459  
5:117:8167:28:27:71:543:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:four-digit SIC codes in 1987.  These data are summarized in table 1.  They represent a snapshot 
5:118:8263:27:28:71:372:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the technique of production, held constant in a single year.  
5:119:8328:28:27:71:543:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Figure  1a  demonstrates  the  degree  to  which  the  U.S.  industrial  composition  has  shifted  
5:120:8430:27:28:71:545:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:towards  polluting  industries.    The  first  (bold)  line  plots  an  index  of  total  real  manufacturing  
5:121:8541:28:28:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:output.  The recessions of the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and early 1990s are apparent, and overall 
5:122:8638:28:15:71:366:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing grew by 57 percent between 1972 and 1996.

6:125:8774:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The dotted lines in Figure 1a plot the predicted total emissions of sulfur (SO2), suspended 
6:126:8866:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:solids  in  water,  and  hazardous  waste,  three  of  the  14  pollutants  tracked  by  the  IPPS.    The  
6:127:8974:28:27:71:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:predicted  pollution  levels  are  calculated  by  multiplying  each  4-digit  manufacturing  industry’s  
6:128:9080:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:real  annual  value  added  by  the  industry’s  IPPS  coefficient,  and  then  summing  across  industries  
6:129:9189:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to  get  total  predicted  pollution  for  each  year.    By  holding  the  IPPS  coefficients  constant  as  of  
6:130:9303:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1987,  we  are  in  effect  freezing  the  technique  of  production,  and  only  looking  at  changes  in  
6:131:9411:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution  due  to  changes  in  the  scale  and  composition  of  manufacturing.    If  industrial  growth  
6:132:9520:28:27:72:546:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were  balanced,  and  every  four-digit  industry  grew  by  the  same  57  percent  as  did  overall  
6:133:9623:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing,  then  predicted  pollution  would  coincide  perfectly  with  manufacturing  growth,  
6:134:9725:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and grow 57 percent.  The dotted pollution lines would overlie the bold manufacturing line.  But 
6:135:9822:28:27:72:545:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because  relatively  pollution-intensive  industries  shrank,  while  clean  industries  grew,  the  total  
6:136:9930:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:amount of predicted pollution grew by much less over this time period.  Predicted sulfur grew 21 
6:137:10027:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent,  suspended  solids  fell  15  percent,  and  hazardous  waste  grew  35  percent,  all  much  less  
6:138:10136:27:28:71:279:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:than the growth of overall manufacturing.2 
6:139:10178:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Table  2  summarizes  the  data  behind  figure  1.    The  first  column  presents  the  growth  in  
6:140:10282:27:28:72:546:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:real  U.S.  manufacturing  value  added  from  1972  to  1994  (51  percent),  compared  with  the  
6:141:10382:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:predicted  growth  in  each  of  the  14  pollutants,  where  the  predictions  are  based  on  the  scale  and  
6:142:10495:28:27:72:365:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition of manufacturing, holding technique constant.3  
6:143:10555:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Figure  1a  and  table  2  demonstrate  the  degree  to  which  the  U.S.  manufacturing  sector  
6:144:10655:28:41:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shifted towards cleaner industries.  During this same time period, U.S. tariffs fell:  from 1974 to 
6:145:10755:41:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
6:146:10803:7:16:72:512:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:2 Thirteen of the 14 pollutants tracked by the IPPS grew by less than manufacturing.  The only exception was 
6:147:10912:16:12:71:540:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:biological oxygen demand (BOD), which had predicted growth of 69 percent.  Of this growth, 49 percent came from 
6:148:11024:12:11:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:two industries: "chemical preparations n.e.c." (SIC 2899) and "paperboard mills" (SIC 2631).  These industries grew 
6:149:11140:11:7:71:460:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:by 68 and 54 percent, respectively, and had 57 and 32 times the mean IPPS coefficient for BOD. 
6:150:11235:7:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:3 Table 2 uses data only up until 1994, which is the last year of the pollution abatement cost data we use later in the 
6:151:11355:16:0:71:98:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:paper. 
7:152:11363:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1994, the average tariff on manufactured imports to the U.S. fell by over 50 percent, from over 8 
7:153:11461:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent to less than 4 percent.  Given the steep drop in tariffs, combined with the dramatic shift 
7:154:11560:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:towards  cleaner  industries,  we  understand  how  casual  observers  could  conclude  that  the  two  
7:155:11664:27:28:72:545:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trends  are  related.    Indeed,  such  a  relation  makes  sense  intuitively,  since  trade  liberalization  
7:156:11775:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:could  lead  to  increased  specialization,  which  in  turn  could  result  in  the  U.S.  producing  cleaner  
7:157:11887:28:27:72:128:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:goods.        
7:158:11901:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: If it is true that the composition shift of U.S.  manufacturing  toward clean industries has 
7:159:11994:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:been  caused  by  tariff  reductions,  one  might  expect  that  the  composition  of  imports  will  have  
7:160:12102:27:28:72:548:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shifted  towards  dirty  industries.    Figure  1b  investigates  the  pollution  composition  of  imports.    
7:161:12213:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The first (bold) line in figure 1b plots the real value of U.S. imports, which grew by 318 percent 
7:162:12312:28:27:72:545:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from  1972  to  1994.    The  dotted  lines  plot  the  predicted  pollution  content  of  those  imports,  
7:163:12420:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:calculated in the same way as in figure 1a.  We multiply the real value of each 4-digit industry’s 
7:164:12519:28:27:71:545:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports  by  its  IPPS  coefficient  and  then  aggregate  across  industries.    If  the  composition  of  
7:165:12627:27:28:71:543:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports remained the same, then the dotted lines would overlie the bold imports line (i.e., grow 
7:166:12724:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by  318  percent).    The  fact  that  the  dotted  lines  lie  below  the  imports  line  indicates  that  the  
7:167:12837:27:28:71:446:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition of imports to the U.S. has also shifted towards clean industries.   
7:168:12917:28:28:71:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The second column of table 2 summarizes the data behind figure 1b.  Real imports grew 
7:169:13003:28:27:71:546:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:318 percent, while the predicted pollution composition of those imports grew by markedly less.  
7:170:13099:27:28:71:543:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Of the 14 pollutants tracked by the IPPS, none grew by even 2/3 as much as real imports.  Figure 
7:171:13196:28:27:71:544:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1b  and  table  2  thus  demonstrate  that  cleaner  U.S.  manufacturing  composition  is  not  offset  by  
7:172:13304:27:28:71:445:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dirtier imports.  Rather, the composition of imports has also become cleaner.  
7:173:13383:28:28:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  One  potential  counterargument  to  our  observation  that  the  composition  of  imports  has  
7:174:13482:28:0:71:545:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:become  cleaner  is  that  the  concerns  about  tariff  reductions  exacerbating  pollution  havens  is  
8:175:13589:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:based  largely  on  imports  from  developing  countries,  not  from  developed  countries.    To  see  
8:176:13693:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether the composition of imports from relatively poorer countries has become more pollution-
8:177:13787:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intensive, in figure 1c we conduct the same exercise for imports from non-OECD countries only.  
8:178:13883:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The first (bold) line plots the real value of imports from non-OECD countries.  The dotted lines 
8:179:13980:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again  plot  pollution  predicted  from  the  IPPS  coefficients,  multiplied  by  their  respective  4-digit  
8:180:14091:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries’ imports, and aggregated across industries.  Again, pollution predicted by the scale and 
8:181:14191:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition effects, holding technique constant, grew by far less than overall imports, even from 
8:182:14289:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:poorer countries.  Table 2 summarizes these data in column (3).  Real imports from non-OECD 
8:183:14381:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries grew by 344 percent from 1972 to 1994.  But the composition of those imports shifted 
8:184:14476:28:28:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:towards cleaner industries, so that the pollution predicted from those imports grew by far less. 
8:185:14573:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: So far we have demonstrated that the industrial composition of U.S. imports has become 
8:186:14660:27:28:72:545:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:less  pollution-intensive,  and  that  the  missing  polluting  industries  have  not  been  replaced  by  
8:187:14767:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports, or even by imports from non-OECD countries.  A remaining piece of the puzzle, then, is 
8:188:14863:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to  ask  what  happened  to  the  pollution  composition  of  U.S.  exports.    If  the  composition  of  U.S.  
8:189:14975:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:consumption  has  remained  steady,  and  the  composition  of  U.S.  manufactures  and  imports  have  
8:190:15079:27:28:72:498:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:become cleaner, then the U.S. must be exporting the excess clean manufactured goods.   
8:191:15166:28:28:71:544:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Figure  1d  plots  the  growth  in  real  U.S.  exports,  and  the  predicted  pollution  content  of  
8:192:15271:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:those  exports,  in  the  same  manner  as  figure  1a-1c.    Here  the  predicted  pollution  lines  also  lie  
8:193:15384:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:below the real exports line, but the shift is much less stark.  Column (4) of table 2 presents the 
8:194:15483:28:27:72:546:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data  behind  figure  1d.    Real  manufacturing  exports  grew  by  269  percent,  and  most  of  the  
8:195:15587:27:28:72:544:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:predicted  pollutants  grew  by  slightly  less.    While  the  composition  of  U.S.  exports  has  shifted  
8:196:15697:28:28:72:546:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:towards  cleaner  goods,  it  has  not  done  so  as  dramatically  as  has  the  composition  of  U.S.  
8:197:15802:28:0:72:207:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing or imports.   
9:198:15831:0:27:72:548:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:   Together,   figure   1   and   table   2   provide   suggestive   evidence   that   shift   in   U.S.   
9:199:15938:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing towards cleaner industries has not been caused by trade liberalization, because the 
9:200:16036:28:27:71:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shift  in  U.S.  production  has  not  been  matched  by  an  offsetting  shift  in  imports  towards  more  
9:201:16145:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:polluting  industries.    But  this  evidence  is  only  indirect.    For  more  direct  evidence  we  turn  to  a  
9:202:16261:28:28:71:547:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regression-based  approach,  and  ask  whether  tariff  reductions  exacerbate  the  tendency  for  
9:203:16361:28:27:71:521:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:polluting industries to be imported in response to rising domestic pollution abatement costs.   
9:204:16457:27:28:71:74:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
9:205:16457:28:27:71:202:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:3. A regression approach 
9:206:16481:27:28:71:546:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  The  large  and  growing  literature  evaluating  the  relationship  between  environmental

9:208:16688:28:27:71:545:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations  on  trade,  and  sometimes  even  found  counterintuitive  results  suggesting  that  strict  
9:209:16795:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations increase exports and decrease imports.  Through the late 1990s, most 
9:210:16890:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:studies  used  cross-sections  of  data,  making  it  difficult  to  control  for  unobserved  heterogeneity  
9:211:17000:27:28:71:545:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:across countries or industries, and to account for the endogeneity of environmental regulations.4  
9:212:17099:28:27:71:546:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Recent  studies  have  reversed  these  findings  by  using  panels  of  data,  including  industry  or  
9:213:17204:27:28:71:543:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regional fixed-effects to account for heterogeneity, and instrumenting for pollution regulations to 
9:214:17304:28:28:71:222:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:account for their endogeneity.5 
9:215:17335:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: This literature, however, has had little to say about how free trade agreements are likely 
9:216:17426:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to affect the environment, the focus here.  As mentioned previously, U.S. tariffs on imports have 
9:217:17524:28:87:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fallen,  and  the  composition  of  U.S.  manufacturing  has  shifted  towards  cleaner  goods  in  recent  
9:218:17632:87:7:72:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
9:219:17680:7:12:72:530:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:4 Jaffe, et al. (1996) summarized the earlier literature, and Brunnermeier and Levinson (2004) provides an update. 
9:220:17795:12:0:72:407:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:5 See, for example, Ederington and Minier (2003) and Levinson and Taylor (2004). 
10:221:17877:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:decades,  leading  many  observers  to  infer  a  causality  between  these  two  trends.    However,  we  
10:222:17984:27:28:72:397:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:know of no direct empirical tests of whether the trends are related.6 
10:223:18053:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: One problem is that both the economics literature and the public debate have blurred two 
10:224:18142:27:28:72:547:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:alternative  definitions  of  a  “pollution  haven  effect.”    The  first  is  what  we  call  the  direct  effect:    
10:225:18262:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jurisdictions that impose strict environmental regulations may drive out polluting manufacturers 
10:226:18359:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and  increase  imports  of  polluting  goods.    This  direct  effect  has  been  the  focus  of  all  of  the  
10:227:18471:27:28:72:544:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:empirical  studies  to  date.    These  studies  regress  some  measure  of  economic  activity,  (such  as  
10:228:18580:28:27:72:546:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports, M)  on  characteristics  of  industries  or  jurisdictions,  whatever  the  relevant  unit  of  
10:229:18685:27:29:72:440:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observation, including the stringency of the prevailing pollution regulations:

10:231:18804:31:27:72:542:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where Pit is a measure of pollution regulations, Tit is a measure of trade restrictions, Xit is a set of 
10:232:18907:27:28:72:544:401:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry  characteristics,  and  di  and  vt  are  cross-section  and  time  dummies.    In  this  context,  the  
10:233:19021:28:28:72:542:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:direct  effect  of  pollution  regulations  (P)  on  imports  (M)  is  captured  by  the  coefficient  β1 in 
10:234:19129:28:27:72:543:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:equation (1).  Estimation of a negative coefficient on β1 is taken as evidence for the existence of 
10:235:19229:27:28:72:543:318:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a pollution haven effect (i.e., more stringent environmental standards results in more of imports).  
10:236:19330:28:27:72:543:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Whether such “pollution haven effects” exist has taken on great importance in the current 
10:237:19420:27:28:72:543:263:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:policy debates, as the existence of such effects is taken as a potential problem in the negotiation 
10:238:19520:28:27:71:542:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over trade agreements.  Specifically, anti-globalization protests (and Executive Order 13141), are 
10:239:19619:27:28:71:543:208:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concerned that international trade agreements, by lowering tariffs broadly, may enable polluting 
10:240:19716:28:28:71:543:180:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries to avoid strict environmental laws by relocating overseas and thus assist in the creation 
10:241:19817:28:27:71:544:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  pollution  havens.    However,  estimation  of  β1  tells  us  nothing  about  how  trade  liberalization  
10:242:19928:27:16:71:543:125:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will influence the composition of industries and hence pollution patterns.  Indeed, if equation (1) 
10:243:20027:16:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
10:244:20075:8:16:72:529:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:6 Antweiler, et al. (2001) explore a slightly different question.  They ask how trade (rather than tariffs) affects the 
10:245:20195:16:11:71:537:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:environment.  Moreover, they divide the overall effect into separate scale, composition, and technique portions, and 
10:246:20312:11:0:71:492:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f5:show that the composition effect by itself shifts polluting industries towards the U.S., not away from it.   
11:247:20421:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is  correctly  specified,  then  trade  agreements  and  tariff  liberalization  will  have  no  effect  on  the  
11:248:20535:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition of industries unless the trade agreements are asymmetrically implemented and result 
11:249:20631:28:27:72:505:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in disproportionately greater tariff reductions in the more pollution-intensive industries.7   
11:250:20726:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: What is of concern to many environmental activists, however, is what we call the indirect 
11:251:20816:28:28:71:545:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect:  the  effect  of  trade  liberalization  on  the  direct  (pollution-haven)  effect.    Specifically,  
11:252:20927:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:implicit  in  the  concerns  of  many  is  the  assumption  that  pollution-intensive  industries  are  more  
11:253:21037:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sensitive  to  tariff  reductions  than  other  industries,  and  thus  a  broad-based  U.S.  tariff  reduction  
11:254:21150:28:28:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will results in a compositional shift with relatively large increases in U.S. imports of pollution-
11:255:21249:28:30:71:547:487:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intensive   goods.      Technically,   if   the   direct   effect   is   ∂M/∂P,   then   the   indirect   effect   is   
11:256:21369:30:28:71:543:457:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:∂∂M/(∂P∂T).  Empirically, this indirect effect can be measured by adding an interactive term to 
11:257:21465:28:31:71:166:429:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:equation (1) to get  
11:258:21486:31:31:71:408:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:(2)  123iitititititititMPT PTdveβββ′′′=++    ++++Xγαδ 
11:259:21539:31:30:72:544:367:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where β3  captures the indirect effect of pollution regulations on the sensitivity of trade to tariffs.   
11:260:21645:30:31:72:545:337:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Note  that  we  have  interacted  Tit  with  iP,  the  average  pollution  abatement  costs  for  
11:261:21745:31:27:72:543:306:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry i across all time periods.  This means that we are asking whether tariff changes have a 
11:262:21842:27:28:72:543:279:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:larger effect on imports for industries whose average pollution abatement costs are larger.  The 
11:263:21939:28:28:72:544:251:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:independent  effect  of  average  pollution  abatement  costs  on  imports  is  captured  by  the  industry  
11:264:22048:28:27:72:543:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dummies.  We could, of course, have asked a  slightly  different  question,  by  interacting  Tit  with  
11:265:22153:27:31:71:546:196:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:Pit  ,  which  would  estimate  the  degree  to  which  tariffs  have  a  larger  effect  on  imports  for  
11:266:22261:31:31:72:543:165:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries whose pollution abatement costs rose more.  Or, we could have interacted iT with Pit , 
11:267:22359:31:25:72:544:134:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which  would  estimate  the  degree  to  which  increases  in  pollution  abatement  costs  have  a  larger  
11:268:22468:25:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
11:269:22516:8:16:72:510:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:7 The coefficient on tariffs, β2, is constant across industries and is assumed to be independent of the pollution 
11:270:22630:16:11:72:542:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:intensity of the industry.  Thus, a symmetric tariff reduction on all manufacturing industries will have an equal effect 
11:271:22751:11:0:72:373:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:on all industries, and thus no effect on the composition of manufacturing.   
12:272:22830:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect on industries with higher tariffs.  We believe, however, that equation (2) best captures the 
12:273:22930:27:28:72:360:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concerns of Executive Order 13141 and the WTO protests.  
12:274:22987:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  We  estimate  versions  of  equation  (2)  in  which  the  dependent  variable  (Mit)  is  annual  
12:275:23088:27:28:72:547:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports  to  the  U.S.,  by  four-digit  manufacturing  SIC  code.    We  have  two  main  motivations.    
12:276:23195:28:28:72:545:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:First,  we  believe  that  this  interactive  effect  (β3)  is  an  important  test  of  the  effect  of  trade  
12:277:23308:28:27:71:545:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:agreements  on  the  environment.    One  of  the  chief  mechanisms  by  which  trade  will  change  
12:278:23410:27:28:71:550:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental   quality   in   various   countries   is   by   changing   the   distribution   of   industries.      
12:279:23527:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Countries that host increasingly polluting industries as a consequence of trade will become more 
12:280:23624:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:polluted; countries whose industrial compositions become less polluting will become cleaner.  If 
12:281:23721:28:28:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a trade agreement lowers tariffs on polluting industries, and raises tariffs on clean industries, the 
12:282:23823:28:27:71:544:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental  consequences  will  perhaps  be  obvious.    More  realistically,  if  a  trade  agreement  
12:283:23930:27:28:71:545:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lowers  tariffs  across  the  board,  the  environmental  consequences  will  depend  on  whether  the  
12:284:24034:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:polluting  industries  or  the  clean  industries  are  more  responsive  to  the  tariff  reductions:  in  other  
12:285:24149:27:28:71:202:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:words  β3 in equation (2).   
12:286:24178:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The policy debate seems to presume that this indirect effect is negative for the U.S., that 
12:287:24270:27:28:72:547:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lowering  tariffs  will  increase  imports  more  in  those  industries  that  have  stricter  pollution  
12:288:24376:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations.  This inference assumes that the U.S. is at a comparative disadvantage in industries 
12:289:24474:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:facing stringent environmental regulations and thus, a reduction in tariff barriers will result in a 
12:290:24575:27:28:72:546:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relatively  greater  import  surge  in  these  more  regulated  industries.    We,  however,  see  no  
12:291:24678:28:0:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:particular  reason  for  this  to  be  true  as  comparative  disadvantages  can  arise  from  many  factors,  
13:292:24791:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:not just environmental costs.8  We test for the interaction anyway, because we believe it to be the 
13:293:24891:27:28:72:314:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:underlying assumption of so much public debate.  
13:294:24940:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  The  second  important  motivation  for  our  empirical  strategy  is  that  if  equation  (2)  is  the  
13:295:25047:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:correct  specification,  then  equation  (1)  contains  an  important  missing  covariate  that  is  clearly  
13:296:25157:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:correlated  with  pollution  abatement  costs.    The  indirect  pollution  haven  is  thus  not  only  
13:297:25261:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:important in its own right, as the focus of policy concerns, but it may also provide an additional 
13:298:25360:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explanation for why early attempts to measure the direct pollution haven effect have been biased 
13:299:25457:28:27:72:133:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:downwards. 
13:300:25468:27:28:72:75:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
13:301:25468:28:28:72:121:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3.1 Data  
13:302:25478:28:27:72:547:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Because  only  the  United  States  has  collected  pollution  abatement  cost  data  for  a  
13:303:25574:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant period of time, researchers studying pollution havens and trade barriers have focused 
13:304:25672:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on U.S. imports and exports.  This paper, like many before it, starts by following Grossman and 
13:305:25768:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Krueger  (1993)  by  regressing  manufacturing  imports  by  industry  on  industry  characteristics,  as  
13:306:25875:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in equation (1).  Data on imports to the U.S. come from the NBER Trade Database, documented 
13:307:25967:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in  Feenstra  et  al.  (2002).    Our  dependent  variable  (Mit)  is  imports  divided  by  the  value  of  
13:308:26076:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shipments,  taken  from  the  NBER  Manufacturing  Productivity  Database  (Bartelsman,  et  al., 
13:309:26174:28:27:71:110:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1996).9 
13:310:26181:27:28:72:545:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Characteristics  of  industries  include  environmental  costs,  tariffs,  capital  intensity,  and  
13:311:26284:28:29:71:545:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:human  capital  intensity.    Environmental  costs  come  from  the  Pollution  Abatement  Costs  and  
13:312:26387:29:8:71:219:155:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
13:313:26435:8:16:72:526:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:8 A similar point is made by Copeland and Taylor (2003), in which they point out that increased trade could shift 
13:314:26549:16:11:71:510:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:dirty industries to high-environmental standard (high-income) countries if such countries have a comparative 
13:315:26658:11:7:71:425:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:advantage in dirty goods production (due, for example, to relative capital abundance).    
13:316:26748:7:16:72:534:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:9 It should be noted that we strictly follow Grossman and Kruger (1993) in using gross imports (not net imports) as 
13:317:26864:16:12:71:532:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:our dependent variable.  This is due to the fact that we are estimating the effect of unilateral trade liberalization by 
13:318:26985:12:11:71:531:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the U.S. on its imports (i.e., we do not have foreign tariff data to measure the corresponding effect of foreign tariff 
13:319:27105:11:0:71:197:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:liberalization on U.S. exports). 
14:320:27140:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Expenditures  (PACE)  survey  (U.S.  Department  of  Commerce).    We  use  the  data  from  1978  to  
14:321:27243:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1994,10 focusing on pollution abatement operating costs.  The PACE data were not collected in 
14:322:27337:28:27:72:545:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1987, and were not disaggregated by four-digit SIC code in 1979, so we exclude those two years.  
14:323:27434:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our  measure  of  an  industry’s  environmental  costs  (Pit)  is  pollution  abatement  operating  costs

14:325:27628:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Tariffs by four-digit SIC code are taken from Feenstra et al. (2002), where the tariff rate 
14:326:27720:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for each industry is duties paid divided by the customs value of imports.  We converted the 1989-
14:327:27817:28:27:72:443:515:144:g_d0_f3:100:Courier:94 data to the 1972 SIC codes using the Bartelsman and Gray concordance.  
14:328:27890:27:28:72:546:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Finally, each industry is characterized by its capital intensity and human capital intensity.  
14:329:27985:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Like Grossman and Krueger we measure capital intensity as one minus payroll’s share of value

14:345:28535:27:28:72:544:199:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Table  3  presents  summary  statistics  for  these  data.    The  average  U.S.  manufacturing  
14:346:28634:28:27:72:543:171:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry imported 17 percent of the value shipped by domestic producers, divided about evenly 
14:347:28728:27:28:72:544:144:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between  OECD  countries  and  the  rest  of  the  world.    The  average  industry  spent  1.1  percent  of  
14:348:28838:28:19:72:547:116:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:total  materials  costs  on  pollution  abatement  operating  costs,  ranging  from  zero  to  18  percent.    
14:349:28949:19:7:72:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
14:350:28997:7:16:72:518:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:10 After 1987 the data switch from the 1972 SIC codes to the 1987 SIC codes.  We used the concordance in the 
14:351:29106:16:0:72:483:74:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f3:NBER Manufacturing Productivity Database to reallocate pollution costs to 1972 industry definitions. 
15:352:29209:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Tariffs  averaged  4.0  percent,  ranging  from  zero  to  over  40  percent.    The  question  we  ask  is  
15:353:29318:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether  those  industries  whose  tariffs  dropped  most  saw  larger  increases  in  imports  if  their  
15:354:29425:28:27:72:231:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental costs were high.   
15:355:29458:27:28:72:75:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
15:356:29458:28:28:72:140:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3.2 Empirics 
15:357:29471:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Table 4 begins with a basic fixed-effect regression of import penetration, by industry, on 
15:358:29562:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry characteristics from 1978 to 1994.  It is a panel-data version of Grossman and Krueger 
15:359:29658:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1993), as represented by equation (1).  Industries whose environmental costs increased also saw 
15:360:29755:27:28:71:544:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their  imports  increase,  and  industries  whose  tariffs  increased  saw  imports  decrease.11    Equally  
15:361:29864:28:28:72:547:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sensibly, higher capital intensity and human capital intensity are associated with lower imports.  
15:362:29963:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: At the bottom of table 4 we have calculated the elasticity of imports with respect to tariffs 
15:363:30057:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(-0.44) as a useful benchmark to compare with later specifications and samples.  It suggests that 
15:364:30155:28:27:72:456:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a 10 percent increase in tariffs is associated with a 4 percent decline in imports. 
15:365:30239:27:28:72:546:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  In  column  (2)  of  table  4  we  include  an  interaction  term,  as  in  equation  (2).    Our  
15:366:30340:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interpretation of public rhetoric, and EO13141, is that the coefficient (β3) on this interactive term 
15:367:30442:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is expected to be negative.  However, in practice the coefficient (50.6) is positive and statistically 
15:368:30545:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant.  Polluting industries appear to be less sensitive to tariff reductions rather than more 
15:369:30646:28:27:72:471:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sensitive, and trade liberalization does not exacerbate the pollution haven effect.12  
15:370:30733:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  If  we  take  the  point  estimates  from  column  (2)  seriously,  and  calculate  the  elasticity  of  
15:371:30840:28:41:72:546:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:import  penetration  with  respect  to  environmental  costs  at  the  average  level  of  tariffs,  that  
15:372:30947:41:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
15:373:30995:7:16:72:541:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:11 The fact that the coefficient on the environmental cost variable is negative and statistically significant is consistent 
15:374:31119:16:12:72:502:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:with recent literature that uses time series data and fixed effects, and departs from previous efforts (such as 
15:375:31231:12:7:72:317:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Grossman and Krueger) that relied on a single cross section.  
15:376:31293:7:16:72:544:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:12  This  result,  that  polluting  industries  are  less  sensitive  to  tariff  reductions,  is  consistent  with  previous  work  
15:377:31426:16:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:(Ederington et  al.,  2004),  in  which  we  show  that  polluting  industries  are  less  geographically  footloose  than  clean  
15:378:31557:11:0:72:539:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:industries.  This would make them less sensitive to changes in tariffs as well as to changes in pollution regulations.   
16:379:31680:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:elasticity is -0.38.  Though this number is not markedly different from the tariff elasticity when 
16:380:31779:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the interaction term is omitted (-0.44), the important point is that the interaction term is positive, 
16:381:31882:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:so  that  as  we  consider  industries  with  lower  pollution  abatement  costs,  this  estimated  elasticity  
16:382:31994:27:28:72:220:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will shrink in absolute value.   
16:383:32027:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  We  conclude  from  table  4  that  in  general,  tariff  reductions  from  1978  to  1994  did  not  
16:384:32131:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significantly increase imports more from polluting industries than from clean industries.  In fact, 
16:385:32231:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the opposite is more likely to be true: if anything, trade liberalization has shifted U.S. industrial 
16:386:32333:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition toward dirtier industries, by increasing imports of polluting goods by less than clean 
16:387:32432:27:28:72:113:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:goods.   
16:388:32441:28:28:72:547:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  In  previous  work,  we  explored  the  possibility  that  environmental  regulations  have  
16:389:32536:28:27:72:546:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:different  effects  on  trade  with  developing  countries  than  they  do  on  trade  with  developed  
16:390:32640:27:28:72:547:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries  (Ederington  et  al.,  2004).    It  seems  plausible  that  the  same  forces  are  at  work  here.    
16:391:32755:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Trade  agreements  may  alter  the  pollution  intensity  of  trade  between  the  U.S.  and  developing  
16:392:32861:27:28:71:327:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries, but not with other developed countries.13   
16:393:32916:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To test whether trade agreements have increased imports in pollution-intensive industries 
16:394:33006:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from  developing  countries,  in  table  5  we  run  versions  of  equations  (1)  and  (2)  separately  for  
16:395:33116:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.    The  coefficients  are  smaller  than  for  the  whole  sample  
16:396:33215:28:27:72:545:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because  the  scale  of  the  dependent  variable  is  smaller:  imports  from  OECD  divided  by  U.S.  
16:397:33320:27:28:72:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value shipped.  Hence comparisons can be made only by examining the relevant elasticities.  In 
16:398:33415:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:column (1) of table 5, without the interaction term, the elasticity of imports with respect to tariffs 
16:399:33518:27:28:71:544:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(-0.15)  is  smaller  for  OECD  countries  than  for  all  imports.    Most  importantly,  as  with  the  full  
16:400:33631:28:20:71:511:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sample, the interactive term in column (2) of table 5 is positive and statistically significant. 
16:401:33728:20:8:71:219:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
16:402:33776:8:16:72:501:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:13 Intuitively, if the U.S. is at a comparative disadvantage in dirty goods production (due to high regulatory 
16:403:33887:16:11:72:539:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:standards) against developing countries but not other developed countries, then trade liberalization might only result 
16:404:34006:11:0:72:345:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:in large increases in polluting imports from the developing world.    
17:405:34078:0:27:72:546:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  The  real  test,  however,  comes  with  imports  from  non-OECD  countries,  where  the  
17:406:34170:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concern about pollution havens is strongest.  Once again the interactive term between tariffs and 
17:407:34268:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution  costs  remains  positive  and  statistically  significant.    The  point  estimate  (31.7)  implies  
17:408:34380:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that tariff reductions have had a smaller effect on imports from non-OECD countries in the more 
17:409:34476:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution-intensive industries.  The interacted coefficient in column (4) has exactly the opposite 
17:410:34575:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sign  to  what  we  perceive  to  be  the  conventional  wisdom.    Rather  than  the  U.S.  manufacturing  
17:411:34683:27:28:71:545:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sector  becoming  cleaner  at  the  expense  of  the  manufacturing  sector  in  developing  countries,  
17:412:34788:28:27:71:546:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:column  (4)  suggests  that  the  U.S.  manufacturing  sector  has  become  more  polluting  as  a  
17:413:34888:27:28:71:240:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consequence of tariff reductions.14 
17:414:34923:28:28:72:75:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
17:415:34923:28:27:72:229:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4. Predicted pollution changes 
17:416:34954:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Tables 4 and 5 examine whether pollution-intensive industries might be more responsive 
17:417:35041:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to  broad-based  tariff  reductions  than  clean  industries,  and  finds  just  the  opposite.    Thus  our  
17:418:35151:27:28:72:545:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimates  imply  that  symmetric  tariff  reductions  in  the  U.S.  would  have  actually  shifted  the  
17:419:35258:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:composition of U.S. manufacturing towards dirtier industries.   There is, however, an alternative 
17:420:35356:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mechanism  through  which  the  trade  agreements  could  make  U.S.  manufacturing  cleaner.    It  
17:421:35457:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:might  be  that  trade  agreements,  either  past  or  future,  are  skewed  towards  pollution-intensive  
17:422:35564:28:27:72:544:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries.    If  tariffs  fell  more  for  polluting  industries  than  for  clean  industries  from  1978  to  
17:423:35678:27:28:72:546:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1994,  then  trade  liberalization  might  be  said  to  have  caused  a  shift  of  polluting  industries  
17:424:35786:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overseas,  even  if  the  interactive  coefficient  β3  in  equation  (2)  is  zero.    Alternatively,  if  current  
17:425:35903:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tariffs  are  higher  for  polluting  industries  than  for  clean  industries,  then  future  trade  agreements  
17:426:36017:28:20:72:476:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that lower all tariffs to zero might be expected to shift polluting industries overseas. 
17:427:36106:20:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
17:428:36154:8:16:72:542:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:14 This result is actually consistent with those of Antweiler et al., (2001) and Copeland and Taylor (2003) who, using 
17:429:36273:16:11:71:508:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:a different technique, estimate that trade integration has shifted dirty-goods industries to high-standard (high-
17:430:36386:11:0:71:148:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:income) countries. 
18:431:36407:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The first thing to note is that on average, industries whose tariffs  fell  further  had  higher  
18:432:36505:27:28:71:543:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution abatement costs than industries whose tariffs rose, or fell by less.  Specifically, the raw 
18:433:36607:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:correlation between the change in tariffs from 1978 to 1994 and average pollution costs is -0.19, 
18:434:36705:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which  is  statistically  significantly  different  from  zero.    While  this  correlation  is  not  strong,  it  
18:435:36820:28:28:71:546:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lends  plausibility  to  the  claim  that  tariff  reductions  might  have  caused  the  shift  in  U.S.  
18:436:36926:28:27:71:532:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing composition, because the reductions were skewed towards polluting industries.   
18:437:37020:27:28:71:544:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  To  explore  the  magnitudes  of  the  correlations  between  environmental  costs  and  tariff  
18:438:37119:28:27:71:546:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reductions,  in  table  6  we  predict  the  declines  in  U.S.  pollution  resulting  from  U.S.  tariff  
18:439:37226:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reductions from 1978 to 1994 using the coefficients of table 4.  First, in column (1) of table 6 we 
18:440:37326:28:28:71:545:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:list  the  estimated  change  in  the  emissions  of  the  14  pollutants  modeled  by  the  World  Bank’s  
18:441:37434:28:27:71:543:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS) due to scale effects and compositional shift in U.S. 
18:442:37533:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries.  These are the same data used to generate figure 1, but for the shorter time period for 
18:443:37633:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which  pollution  abatement  cost  data  are  available.    To  generate  the  numbers  in  column  (1),  we  
18:444:37743:27:28:71:543:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:used the IPPS coefficients to predict the amount of pollution generated in each industry in 1978 
18:445:37840:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and  then  aggregated  across  all  industries.    We  did  the  same  for  1994  and  then  reported  the  
18:446:37948:27:28:71:543:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentage change between 1978 and 1994.  The numbers differ because industries with varying 
18:447:38041:28:28:71:500:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution intensities for different pollutants grew by different amounts during the period. 
18:448:38133:28:27:71:543:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: As in figure 1, while the real value of manufacturing output increased by 36 percent from 
18:449:38223:27:28:71:544:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1978  to  1994,  the  predicted  pollution  either  rose  by  much  less,  or  declined  outright.    This  is  
18:450:38335:28:27:71:543:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because the manufacturing industries have shifted towards those that produce less pollution.  In 
18:451:38432:27:28:71:546:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:other  words,  while  manufacturing  output  increased,  predicted  airborne  particulate  emissions  
18:452:38534:28:28:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:declined  by  6.4  percent  because  those  four-digit  industries  that  produce  the  most  particulates  
18:453:38642:28:0:71:479:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:declined over the period, while those that produced the least increased their output.   
19:454:38732:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To render the pollution changes in column (1) of table 6 comparable with the predictions 
19:455:38821:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from  the  regression  coefficients,  in  column  (2)  we  report  the  predicted  change  relative  to  the  
19:456:38931:28:27:71:544:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change  in  real  manufacturing  growth.    For  example,  the  decline  in  particulates  of  6.4  percent  
19:457:39040:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:represents  a  31  percent  decline  relative  to  the  36  percent  growth  in  manufacturing.    ([1-
19:458:39143:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:0.064]/[1.36]-1  =  -0.31)    This  amounts  to  examining  the  composition  effect  alone,  eliminating  
19:459:39250:28:27:72:252:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both the scale and technique effects.  
19:460:39289:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In column (3) we use what we know about the changes in tariffs over this time period to 
19:461:39377:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ask  whether  the  fact  that  tariff  reductions  were  steeper  in  more  polluting  industries  could  have  
19:462:39489:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:caused this shift in U.S. manufacturing towards cleaner industries, presumably at the expense of 
19:463:39586:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:other countries’ environmental quality.  We used the tariff coefficients from column (2) of table 
19:464:39684:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:4, along with the actual industry-level tariffs and environmental costs, to predict the changes in 
19:465:39783:27:28:72:546:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports  (as  a  share  of  value  shipped)  that  resulted  from  U.S.  tariff  reductions.      We  then  
19:466:39891:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:multiplied this result by the actual value shipped in each industry, to get the predicted change in 
19:467:39991:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports.    We  then  assumed  as  a  benchmark  that  changes  in  imports  are  offset  dollar-for-dollar  
19:468:40100:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with domestic production, so we can multiply the import change by the IPPS coefficients to get 
19:469:40195:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:predicted  changes  in  pollution  emanating  from  each  industry.15    Finally,  we  aggregated  these  
19:470:40301:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution changes across all industries, and divided by the total estimated pollution as of 1978, to 
19:471:40402:28:27:72:366:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:get the predicted percentage changes reported in column (3). 
19:472:40463:27:28:72:546:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  As  column  (3)  shows,  predicted  pollution  declined  only  slightly  due  to  the  varying  
19:473:40561:28:27:72:544:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:declines  in  industry-specific  tariffs.    Given  the  degree  to  which  tariffs  declined  over  this  time  
19:474:40674:27:28:72:544:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period,  the  predicted  effect  of  this  on  imports,  and  the  predicted  pollution  associated  with  each  
19:475:40787:28:32:72:544:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry,  imports  are  sufficient  to  replace  from  1  to  3  percent  of  pollution  generated  by  U.S.  
19:476:40898:32:7:72:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
19:477:40946:7:16:72:531:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f5:15 Note that this exaggerates the pollution changes, because the IPPS coefficients are calculated per dollar of value 
19:478:41064:16:0:72:241:74:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f3:added, and we multiply by value shipped. 
20:479:41107:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing.  This change is small relative to the overall shift in U.S. manufacturing towards 
20:480:41204:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cleaner  industries  demonstrated  in  column  (2).    Though  tariff  reductions  have  been  steeper  in  
20:481:41312:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more  pollution-intensive  industries,  that  can  explain  only  a  small  part  of  the  shift  of  U.S.  
20:482:41420:27:28:71:281:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing towards cleaner industries.   
20:483:41464:28:28:71:546:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  There  is,  however,  one  last  interpretation  of  the  environmental  opposition  to  trade  
20:484:41562:28:27:71:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liberalization  that  we  can  examine  with  these  data.    Observers  could  be  concerned  that  current 
20:485:41670:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:tariff levels offer more protection to polluting industries than to clean industries, and that future 
20:486:41772:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trade  agreements  that  lower  all  U.S.  tariffs  to  zero  could  cause  U.S.  polluting  industries  to  
20:487:41881:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relocate overseas more than relatively clean industries.  In column (3) of table 5 we predict the 
20:488:41979:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change in U.S. manufacturing pollution that would result from a drop in tariffs from their 1994 
20:489:42075:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:levels down to zero.  For each four-digit SIC code we calculate the level of the 1994 tariffs (from 
20:490:42175:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Feenstra et al., 2002).  We then use the tariff and interactive coefficients from table 4 to predict 
20:491:42276:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  change  in  imports  that  would  result  from  reducing  these  1994  tariffs  to  zero.    We  then  
20:492:42384:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:assume  as  a  benchmark  that  those  imports  replace  U.S.  production,  and  use  the  IPPS  pollution  
20:493:42492:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:coefficients to generate the resulting change in each of the 14 pollutants.  As column (4) shows, 
20:494:42590:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this  results  in  very  small  changes  in  pollution  relative  to  actual  changes  over  the  1978  to  1994  
20:495:42704:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:period.  Once again, we find little basis for the fear that tariff reductions themselves will generate 
20:496:42807:28:27:72:489:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:large shifts in the composition of U.S. manufacturers away from polluting industries.

20:498:42895:28:27:72:149:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:5. Conclusions 
20:499:42910:27:28:72:543:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The “trade and environment” debate has captured public interest, from the street protests

20:501:43095:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accompanied by environmental impact statements.  The general consensus seems to be that tariff 
21:502:43192:0:27:72:545:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:barriers  protect  U.S.  manufacturers  that  would  otherwise  move  overseas  to  avoid  increasingly  
21:503:43297:27:28:71:544:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:strict  U.S.  environmental  standards,  and  that  trade  agreements,  by  lowering  these  tariffs,  will  
21:504:43406:28:27:71:336:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:disproportionately affect the most polluting industries. 
21:505:43463:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: This story is, on the surface, consistent with recent U.S. experience that has seen the U.S. 
21:506:43556:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing  sector  shift  towards  cleaner  industries.    As  we  show  in  this  paper,  while  the  
21:507:43663:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sector’s  real  value  added  grew  by  51  percent  from  1972  to  1994,  that  growth  occurred  mostly  
21:508:43771:27:28:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:among the least polluting industries, causing the estimated emissions of most of the 14 pollutants 
21:509:43870:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tracked by the World Bank’s IPPS to rise by much less than 51 percent, or even to decline.  This 
21:510:43967:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shift has occurred simultaneously with a general reduction in U.S. tariff barriers due primarily to 
21:511:44067:28:28:72:241:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the success of GATT negotiations. 
21:512:44101:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  We  show,  however,  that  these  two  trends  appear  unrelated.    We  find  no  evidence  that  
21:513:44202:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:domestic production of pollution-intensive goods in the U.S. is being replaced by imports from 
21:514:44297:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overseas.    In  addition,  we  find  that  symmetric  tariff  reductions  in  the  U.S.  have  most  likely  
21:515:44407:27:28:72:549:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:induced   a   compositional   change   towards   dirtier   industries   (not   cleaner)   among   U.S.   
21:516:44512:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing.  Finally, while polluting industries have experienced larger tariff reductions than 
21:517:44611:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:other industries in the U.S., these tariff reductions do not appear to be of sufficient magnitude to 
21:518:44712:28:0:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explain more than a small fraction of the shift in U.S. manufacturing towards cleaner industries.
