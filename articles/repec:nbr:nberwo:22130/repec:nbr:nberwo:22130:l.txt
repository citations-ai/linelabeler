2:31:1636:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:Randomized  field  experiments  designed  to  better  understand  the  production  of  human  capital 
2:32:1738:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:have increased  exponentially  over  the  past  several  decades.  This  chapter  summarizes  what  we 
2:33:1840:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:have  learned about  various  partial  derivatives  of  the  human  capital  production  function,  what 
2:34:1944:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:important partial derivatives are left to be estimated, and what – together – our collective efforts 
2:35:2044:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:have  taught  us  about  how  to  produce human  capital  in  developed  countries.  The  chapter 
2:36:2141:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:concludes with a back of the envelope simulation of how much of the racial wage gap in America 
2:37:2235:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:might  be  accounted  for  if  human  capital  policy  focused on  best  practices  gleaned  from 
2:38:2332:14:42:72:218:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:randomized field experiments.

3:48:2624:44:32:72:171:667:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1    Introduction
3:49:2641:32:20:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Racial and ethnic inequality is a stubborn empirical reality across the developed world. Blacks in the United
3:50:2750:20:20:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:States earn twenty-four percent less, live five fewer years, and are six times more likely to be incarcerated on
3:51:2862:20:21:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any given day (Fryer 2010). Black men in the United Kingdom are three times more likely to be unemployed
3:52:2966:21:20:72:540:574:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and as full-time workers, earn twenty percent less (Hatton 2011). The Roma in Hungary are over two years
3:53:3070:20:20:72:539:554:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:less educated, have worse self-reported health, and earn twenty-eight percent less (K ́antor 2011).  Turkish
3:54:3178:20:21:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:immigrants  in  Germany  are  almost  twice  as  likely  to  be  unemployed  and  earn  thirty-eight  percent  less
3:55:3293:21:20:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(von Loeffelholz 2011).  African immigrants in Spain are less educated than natives, have a 4.9 percentage
3:56:3399:20:20:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point higher unemployment rate, and earn thirty-five percent less (de la Rica 2011). The income difference
3:57:3505:20:21:72:492:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between natives and second generation immigrants in Sweden is 11% (Nordin and Rooth 2007).
3:58:3595:21:20:88:539:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Gaining a better understanding of the underlying causes of such stark racial and ethnic inequality is of
3:59:3699:20:20:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tremendous importance for public policy.  Using data from the U.S., O’Neill (1990) and Neal and Johnson
3:60:3802:20:21:72:540:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1996) demonstrate that blacks, Hispanics, and whites are paid similar prices for similar pre-market skill
3:61:3908:21:20:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bundles – yet, there are large differences in skills. Similarly, Nordin and Rooth (2007) show that differences
3:62:4018:20:20:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in income between natives and second generation immigrants in Sweden depend strongly on a skill gap –
3:63:4119:20:21:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when controlling for scores on the Swedish Military Enlistment Test, the income gap decreases by more
3:64:4220:21:20:72:164:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than seventy percent.
3:65:4241:20:20:88:539:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An important question then, is what obstacles preclude the acquisition of productive skills.  Using ten
3:66:4344:20:21:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:large datasets which together, include students that range in age from eight months to 17 years old, Fryer
3:67:4450:21:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  Levitt  (2013)  show  that  the  racial  achievement  gap  is  remarkably  robust  across  time,  samples,  and
3:68:4566:20:20:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assessments.  The achievement gap does not exist in the first year of life, but black students in the U.S. fall
3:69:4677:20:21:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behind by age two (in the raw data) and these racial differences in academic achievement after kindergarten
3:70:4784:21:20:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cannot be explained by including standard controls. Similarly, controls cannot explain differences between
3:71:4890:20:20:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children of natives and children of immigrants on international standardized tests such as the Programme for
3:72:4998:20:20:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:International Student Assessment (PISA), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS),
3:73:5101:20:21:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) in other developed countries such as France,
3:74:5206:21:20:72:377:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Switzerland, Netherlands, and Sweden (Parsons and Smeeding 2008).
3:75:5271:20:20:88:539:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If the deleterious effects of labor market discrimination are in decline and the importance of productive
3:76:5376:20:0:72:540:87:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:skills are on the rise, an important public policy question is how to increase human capital – particularly for
4:77:5488:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those who, due to accident of birth, begin life disadvantaged.  A fuller understanding would allow policy
4:78:5593:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:makers to use basic economic principles (e.g.  equating marginal return to marginal costs) in their decision
4:79:5701:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:making.  Is it more cost-effective to decrease class size or provide parents financial incentives to increase
4:80:5810:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student achievement? Should school districts increase the management skills of principals or increase early
4:81:5917:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:childhood programs?  What is a better use of resources – early childhood investments or providing high-
4:82:6020:21:20:72:209:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dosage tutoring to adolescents?
4:83:6051:20:20:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In an effort to answer questions like these, education researchers have spent decades trying to infer causal
4:84:6159:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relationships from non-experimental data by examining large data sets and invoking various assumptions,
4:85:6262:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many of which are not verifiable.  Prior to the late 1970s, research on the relationship between class size
4:86:6369:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and academic achievement was widely considered inconclusive (Porwell 1978; Glass and Smith 1978).  In
4:87:6470:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fact, some studies, including the famous Coleman Report, suggested there were greater gains in classrooms
4:88:6575:21:20:72:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:withmorestudents (Nelson 1959; Coleman et al.  1966).  These studies did not adequately account for the
4:89:6678:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fact that school districts commonly bundled better students and teachers in classrooms with more students.
4:90:6784:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A well-designed randomized experiment would enable researchers to avoid such confounding factors and
4:91:6884:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:help settle the debate among non-experimental estimates. Using the random assignment of students to small
4:92:6989:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classes in Project STAR, Krueger (1999) showed that students assigned to small classrooms indeed do score
4:93:7094:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher than students in regular sized classrooms.  The effect sizes for the K-3 students in Project STAR are
4:94:7202:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the range of 0.19-0.28 standard deviations and represent 64 to 82 percent of the white-black test score gap
4:95:7312:20:20:72:117:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the data
4:96:7323:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly, a large body of non-experimental studies have found significant positive correlations between
4:97:7427:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:neighborhood socioeconomic status and students’ academic achievement (Aaronson 1998; Ainsworth 2002;
4:98:7527:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Chase-Lansdale and Gordon 1996; Chase-Lansdale et al. 1997; Duncan, Brooks-Gunn, and Klebanov 1994;
4:99:7626:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Halpern-Felsher et al. 1997; Kohen et al. 2002). However, randomized and quasi-experimental studies have
4:100:7730:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:failed to establish a causal link. Although Rosenbuam (1995) found that suburban students from Chicago’s
4:101:7834:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Gautreaux program outperformed urban students,  Jacob (2004) found no effects on students’ test scores
4:102:7936:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from switching neighborhoods due to housing demolitions. Further, Oreopoulous (2003) found no evidence
4:103:8038:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of long-term impacts of neighborhood quality on labor market outcomes in a quasi-experimental analysis.
4:104:8141:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:More importantly, in the short-run, the Moving to Opportunity randomized housing mobility experiment
4:105:8241:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Ludwig et al.  2012;  Kling,  Liebman and Katz 2007;  Sanbonmatsu et al.  2011) produced no sustained
4:106:8343:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:improvements in academic achievement, educational attainment, risky behaviors, or labor market outcomes
4:107:8446:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for either female or male children, including those who were below school age at the time of random assign-
4:108:8553:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment. Interestingly though, Chetty et al. (2016) show that the Moving to Opportunity experiment had large
5:109:8659:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts on early-adulthood outcomes for children who were younger than 13 years old at randomization.
5:110:8760:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In their mid-twenties, these individuals have 31% higher income, have higher college attendance rates, are
5:111:8866:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:less likely to be single parents, and live in better neighborhoods relative to similar individuals in the control
5:112:8979:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:group.  For children who were older than 13 years old at randomization, the experiment had no positive
5:113:9081:20:21:72:154:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long-term impacts.
5:114:9099:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the 1920s, William McCall, an education psychologist at Columbia University, was one of the first
5:115:9199:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supporters of using randomization to investigate the validity of education programs. His 1923 book, “How
5:116:9303:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to Experiment in Education”, developed a method for gathering data by randomly determining treatment and
5:117:9407:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control groups.  His work provided the framework for the experimental designs we see in educational field

5:119:9617:20:21:72:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book with the wave of large-scale social experiments in the latter half of the 20th century.1In the 1960s we
5:120:9725:21:20:71:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:saw the Perry preschool experiment and the income maintenance experiments, in the 1970s the Abecedarian
5:121:9828:20:20:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:project was initiated, and in the 1980s there was Project STAR, the Tennessee class size experiment. The data
5:122:9937:20:21:71:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from these randomized experiments alone were used for decades to investigate many interesting questions
5:123:10040:21:20:71:253:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about how to best produce human capital.
5:124:10080:20:20:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The inherent power of randomized field experiments is in the ability to estimate partial derivatives of
5:125:10183:20:21:71:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the educational production function.  That is, holding other variables constant, one can alter the amount of
5:126:10291:21:20:71:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time students spend in school or the salary of their teachers, or whether or not the students receive financial
5:127:10402:20:20:71:301:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives. One’s imagination is the only real bound.
5:128:10455:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To see the advantages of this approach, imagine the following simple production process.2LetYi jdenote

5:138:11333:11:14:87:539:99:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:2The  model  is  meant  to  illuminate,  clarify,  and  contrast  estimates  in  the  literature.   It  is  not  meant  to  be  “realistic”  or  to
5:139:11480:14:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:be directly estimable.  There is a rich literature designed to better understand and empirically estimate the education production

6:141:11696:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to understand the impact of important changes in home environment on student test scores, holding school

6:143:11908:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hand, we may want to understand the impact of investments in school-based reform on human capital holding
6:144:12013:20:20:72:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all else equal by estimating∂Y∂S. Or, the impact of instilling more “grit” or a “growth mindset” into students,

6:146:12166:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Perhaps recognizing the net benefits of randomized field experiments and because of a desire to avoid
6:147:12267:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:past miscues due to biased estimates, federal and local governments, early childhood centers, entrepreneurs,
6:148:12375:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and school districts have become laboratories for randomized field experiments.  Forty-five years after the
6:149:12482:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:famous Perry Preschool experiment, families in Chicago Heights were rewarded for teaching their own chil-
6:150:12587:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dren a similar curriculum (Fryer, Levitt, and List 2015). Thirty years after the seminal class size experiment
6:151:12697:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in public elementary schools of Tennessee, school districts in both America and Europe have implemented
6:152:12800:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:various tutoring experiments,  management best practices,  and programs designed to increase the human
6:153:12902:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital of the adults in school buildings (e.g.  Fryer 2014; Cook et al.  2014; Clark et al.  2013; Garet et al.
6:154:13014:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2008; Carlson et al. 2011; May et al. 2013; Blachman et al. 2004). Forty years after the income maintenance
6:155:13121:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments, public policy across the developed world is being influenced by researchers investigating the
6:156:13227:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts of welfare-to-work programs, earnings supplements, and parental involvement (e.g. Hamilton et al.
6:157:13332:20:21:72:312:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2001; Michalopoulos et al. 2002; Avvisati et al. 2014).
6:158:13387:21:20:88:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Indeed, randomized control trials in education have increased exponentially over the past 50 years.  In
6:159:13490:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2000,  14 percent of reviewed education publications on What Works Clearinghouse met their standards
6:160:13590:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:without reservations, a distinction given only to well-designed studies that have comparison groups deter-
6:161:13696:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mined through a random process. By 2010, that number had tripled to over 46 percent. Figure 1 provides a
6:162:13800:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time series of studies in education. Throughout the 1980s, these randomized education studies were sparse.
6:163:13906:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:But in the 1990s, we start seeing a steady flow of approximately 10 publications a year that utilize a random
6:164:14015:20:21:72:517:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:design and then this number increases all the way up to a high of 49 randomized experiments in 2009.
6:165:14115:21:20:88:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Given the remarkable increase in the use of randomized field trials over the past 50 years and the robust
6:166:14220:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlation between human capital and other economic outcomes such as income and employment, it’s time
6:167:14322:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to take stock and summarize what we have learned about various partial derivatives of the human capital
6:168:14425:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:production function, what important partial derivatives are left to be estimated, and what – together– our
6:169:14531:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collective effort over the past several decades has taught us about how to produce human capital in developed

6:171:14651:23:14:87:539:99:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:3To be clear, randomized trials are not a panacea. There are important limitations to randomized controlled trials, which have
6:172:14777:14:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:been documented in Deaton (2010), Mosteller and Boruch (2002), Worrall (2007), and Rothstein and von Wachter (2016), the latter
6:173:14904:11:0:72:540:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:in this volume. We describe a few here. First, many questions that are potentially interesting to economists may not be answerable
7:174:15035:0:20:88:263:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This chapter attempts to do three things.
7:175:15076:20:21:88:540:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:First, We conducted a relatively exhaustive search of all randomized field experiments in education. We
7:176:15179:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:define a field experiment as any intervention that uses averifiablyrandom procedure to assign participants to
7:177:15288:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment and control groups in a non-laboratory environment. This definition, while restrictive, is consistent
7:178:15399:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the definition of a field experiment described in Harrison and List (2004) and the US Department of
7:179:15503:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Education’s What Works Clearinghouse “without reservation” standard.  Using this definition, we sourced
7:180:15606:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost one thousand field experiments to be included in our analysis.   We further limited the sample of
7:181:15710:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:studies to be included to studies conducted in “highly developed” countries with standardized reading or
7:182:15814:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math outcomes.4These restrictions eliminated almost three-quarters of the experiments, leaving a sample
7:183:15917:20:20:72:103:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 199.
7:184:15924:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We divide our sample of studies into three main categories of intervention – early childhood, school-
7:185:16025:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based interventions, and home-based interventions – and provide a summary of the literature within each
7:186:16128:20:20:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:category.5Early childhood experiments investigate the impacts of preschool attendance, home-based ini-
7:187:16230:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tiatives that target pre-kindergarten children, and different preschool models on early achievement. Indeed,
7:188:16338:21:23:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any experiment with outcomes measured before kids enter school is categorized as early childhood – inde-
7:189:16442:23:11:72:540:403:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:with a randomized trial. For instance, how much of the variance in achievement is explained by genetic endowment? Given we are
7:190:16568:11:11:72:540:392:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:not likely to alter genetics by means of a field experiment, if one is wed to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) then this question
7:191:16700:11:10:72:540:381:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:is unanswerable. Second, as with all statistics – the evaluation of field experiments has implications for the mean of the population
7:192:16833:10:11:72:540:371:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and may have little value in predicting individual behavior. With large enough RCTs, one can alleviate some of these concerns by
7:193:16961:11:11:72:540:360:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.  Third, and likely most constraining, are a host of important caveats which center on
7:194:17090:11:11:72:540:349:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:external validity. One cannot always generalize the results from a local RCT to other contexts. An obvious example of this is if an
7:195:17221:11:11:72:540:338:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:RCT finds a program has large impacts using a sample of poverty-stricken minority children, one cannot assume the program will
7:196:17347:11:11:72:540:327:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:have similar impacts on the universe of students in the U.S. However, even if the RCT uses a representative sample of the target
7:197:17475:11:11:72:540:316:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:population, there are still concerns of external validity. For example, when implementing a large-scale policy, there could possibly
7:198:17607:11:11:72:540:305:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:be general equilibrium effects that a pilot RCT did not detect. Fourth, Deaton (2010) expresses many concerns about the analyses
7:199:17735:11:11:72:540:294:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and implementations of RCTs – exploring heterogeneous treatment effects can be viewed as data-mining and researchers should
7:200:17858:11:11:72:540:283:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:explore the implications of testing a large number of hypotheses in their studies; researchers rarely use appropriate standard errors
7:201:17991:11:11:72:540:272:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:when reporting results; exploring different combinations of baseline variables to include in regressions is another potential form of
7:202:18124:11:11:72:540:261:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:data-mining; including baseline variables can lead to substantial biases in small samples; attrition from the study must be addressed;
7:203:18258:11:11:72:540:250:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and it is not uncommon for RCTs to have implementation and operational issues that threaten the validity of the experiment. Fifth,
7:204:18388:11:11:72:540:239:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:spillover effects could lead one to misstate a program’s overall effect. The example that Rothstein and von Wachter (2016) give is
7:205:18518:11:11:72:540:228:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:a labor market program that attempts to increase the search effort of individuals in treatment. This program may lower the chances
7:206:18648:11:11:72:540:217:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of finding jobs for the control group and thus overstate the impact of the program’s total effect.  Sixth, RCTs evaluating programs
7:207:18779:11:11:72:540:206:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:are considered “black boxes” that do not reveal the true mechanisms of interest.  Although one can use randomized admission
7:208:18902:11:11:72:540:195:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:lotteries to estimate the causal impact of pre-existing charter schools, the causal relation between specific school inputs cannot
7:209:19032:11:11:72:540:184:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:be determined from such a study.  Finally, Deaton (2010) and others argue that in an effort to overcome the above issues, RCTs
7:210:19158:11:11:72:540:173:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:can become prohibitively expensive.  Still, with these important limitations in mind, the conventional wisdom is:  if youcando a
7:211:19286:11:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:randomized field experiment, you should.  Of the above seven issues which are commonly discussed with RCTs, five of them can
7:212:19410:11:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:be sidestepped by running more, larger, and better designed RCTs. Moreover, if one designs the RCT in a way that helps validate a
7:213:19539:11:8:72:449:140:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:model of selection for observational data, then the only limitation appears to the budget of the researcher.
7:214:19647:8:14:87:539:132:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:4We consider countries as highly developed if they received a classification of “Very High Human Development” in United
7:215:19766:14:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Nations Development Programme (2010). A country is classified as very high if they score in the top quartile on an index of human
7:216:19895:11:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:development that includes life expectancy, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and gross national income per
7:217:20021:11:8:72:96:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:capita.
7:218:20028:8:14:87:540:88:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:5We don’t focus on mindset experiments (Miin the production function above) due to very few of these experiments passing

8:224:20564:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gorize as a school-based intervention.  Even experiments in which K-12 resources are given at home – for
8:225:20668:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instance tutors from the school tutor students in their living rooms – We code as a school-based experi-
8:226:20772:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment.  Home-based experiments focus on parenting, income constraints, neighborhood environment, and a
8:227:20873:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student’s access to educational resources in their household. Similar to above, if an experiment takes place
8:228:20981:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at home and focuses on these inputs, then it is considered a home-based experiment. For example, parenting
8:229:21087:20:20:72:427:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classes that take place in a school auditorium are considered a home intervention.
8:230:21169:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the above categories are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and internally consistent –
8:231:21272:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which categories to sort experiments into is a bit arbitrary. For example, in Sumi et al. (2012), both teachers
8:232:21383:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and parents received training on how to teach students replacement behaviors. This is potentially important
8:233:21490:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because when we combine estimates within categories across the set of experiments using the DerSimonian-
8:234:21594:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Laird meta-analysis coefficient (see DerSimonian and Laird 1986) – the labels on categories become a “lazy
8:235:21700:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:man’s” way of deciding what works and what doesn’t.  If the meta-analysis coefficient for early childhood
8:236:21805:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:studies is greater than the coefficient for home studies, this is evidence that early childhood studies have a
8:237:21915:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher impact on average.  In an attempt to avoid interactions of the categories in our analysis, studies that
8:238:22025:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have characteristics of more than one category are excluded from our analysis (but are still included in the
8:239:22133:20:20:72:104:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tables).
8:240:22141:20:21:88:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:With these caveats in mind, the results of this inquiry are interesting and, in some cases, quite surpris-
8:241:22247:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing.   There is substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects across and within various categories of field
8:242:22355:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments. Experiments in early childhood and schools can be particularly effective at producing human
8:243:22459:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:capital.  The random effects meta-coefficients for early childhood experiments are 0.111σ(0.031) for stan-
8:244:22565:21:20:72:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dardized math scores and 0.165σ(0.032) for reading.  The estimates for schools are 0.052σ(0.008) and
8:245:22665:20:20:72:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.068σ(0.009) for math and reading scores, respectively. Within school-based field experiments, those that
8:246:22771:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alter the management practices of schools, or implement “high-dosage” tutoring tend to demonstrate large
8:247:22875:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects.  Having pooled impacts in the range of 0.507-0.655σ,  the three most successful early childhood
8:248:22979:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments were the famous Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project (Weikart et al. 1970) and evaluations of the

8:250:23192:21:20:72:539:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:producing pooled impacts ranging from 0.779-1.582σ, the most successful programs appear to be Reading

9:252:23396:0:20:72:100:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2001).
9:253:23402:20:21:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Interventions that attempt to lower poverty, change neighborhoods, or otherwise alter the home envi-

9:255:23607:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results.  Avvisati et al.  (2014) show that a comprehensive parent training program in France had large be-
9:256:23714:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:havioral impacts that spilled over to students whose parents did not participate.  However, the study found
9:257:23821:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no impacts on academic outcomes.  The famous negative income tax experiment – which provided low-
9:258:23918:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income families with more money while incentivizing them to work less – had no impact on children’s test
9:259:24022:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores (Maynard and Murnane 1979). As with Avvisati et al. (2014) and Maynard and Murnane (1979), the
9:260:24123:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average home or neighborhood experiment that our search returned has math and reading impacts that are
9:261:24225:20:20:72:247:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically indistinguishable from zero.
9:262:24267:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The literature – all 196 randomized field experiments discovered through our search process – is sum-
9:263:24368:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marized in a large set of tables at the end of the chapter.  This was the most laborius part of the process.
9:264:24476:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For each study, we collected data on sample demographics, key aspects of the research design, and effect
9:265:24580:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sizes.  The typical study published in a top economics journal has this information readily available and
9:266:24685:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collecting the data only took a few minutes.  But, some studies published in older journals, less technical
9:267:24792:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:journals, or government reports required an exhaustive search of the publication to estimate effect sizes from
9:268:24902:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the information given. The large collection of tables provide a bird’s eye view of the set of randomized field
9:269:25012:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments that have been conducted and evaluated. We include a large set of studies that vary curriculum
9:270:25118:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:choices.  These are included in the tables but not described in the text, as they don’t align with traditional
9:271:25228:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic choice variables in a concise way and because of the potential effects of publication bias on these
9:272:25336:20:21:72:143:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:types of studies.
9:273:25353:21:20:88:540:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, for every randomized field experiment found, we calculated the impact (in standard deviations)
9:274:25455:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the intervention on standardized math and reading outcomes and collected data on features of the ex-
9:275:25558:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:periment.  These data include over forty potential explanatory variables, including length of intervention,
9:276:25665:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grade/age of subjects, location, if the sample was a majority English Language Learner (ELL), disadvan-

9:278:25875:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the correlation of important sample demographics and treatment effects of experiments designed to increase
9:279:25981:21:20:72:136:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:human capital.
9:280:25995:20:20:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An important pattern that arises in the data is the correlation between effectiveness of treatment and age
9:281:26101:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of subjects at the time of intervention.  It has also been observed that some interventions tend to be more
9:282:26208:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effective at increasing math achievement relative to reading achievement (Fryer 2014; Abdulkadiroglu et al.
9:283:26315:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2011; Angrist et al.  2011; Dobbie and Fryer 2011; Hoxby and Murarka 2009; Gleason et al.  2010).  There
10:284:26420:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are many theories that may explain the disparity in treatment effects by subject area. A leading explanation
10:285:26528:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:posits that reading scores are influenced by the language spoken when students are outside of the classroom
10:286:26635:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Charity et al.  2004; Rickford 1999).  Charity et al.  (2004) argue that if students speak non-standard En-
10:287:26743:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:glish at home and in their communities, increasing reading scores might be especially difficult. Research in
10:288:26851:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:developmental psychology has suggested a second possibility – that the critical period for language devel-
10:289:26957:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:opment occurs early in life, while the critical period for developing higher cognitive functions extends into
10:290:27066:20:20:72:531:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:adolescence (Hopkins and Bracht 1975; Newport 1990; Pinker 1994; Nelson 2000; Knudsen et al. 2006).
10:291:27165:20:21:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our data suggests that the age theory has merit.  In math, the treatment effect is not strongly related to
10:292:27271:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the age of the student at the time of intervention.  The correlation coefficient is 0.0679.  In stark contrast,
10:293:27382:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:early in life, many reforms increase reading performance. Later in life, very few treatments have any effect
10:294:27490:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on reading, save “high dosage” tutoring.  Put precisely – there is a negative relationship between age and
10:295:27596:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading treatment effects.   The correlation coefficient is -0.2069.   To put this number in perspective,  the
10:296:27706:20:20:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average effect on reading of interventions targeting children with an average age less than 5 is 0.177σ. The
10:297:27814:20:21:72:523:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average effect of reading interventions targeting students with an average age greater than 14 is 0.039σ.
10:298:27919:21:20:88:540:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:Third, We conclude this chapter by simulating a life-cycle model that enables us to make an educated
10:299:28019:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:guess about how much of racial and ethnic wage inequality in America might be accounted for if we simply
10:300:28123:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used  the  best  practices  gleaned  from  an  exhaustive  review  of  what  works  in  the  literature.   Although  a
10:301:28241:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:majority of the randomized field trials discussed in this chapter do not report impacts on adult outcomes, we
10:302:28350:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are able to use correlations from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and NLSY79
10:303:28450:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Children and Young Adults (CNLSY) datasets to simulate how shocks in a given life-stage will impact
10:304:28549:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:later outcomes. Specifically, we follow the methods described in Winship and Owen (2013) and construct a
10:305:28653:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model similar to the Social Genome Model (SGM). Using this model, we estimate that if children were given
10:306:28758:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a successful early childhood intervention and then received successful school-based interventions in mid-
10:307:28863:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:childhood and again in adolescence, one might dramatically reduce, and under some assumptions eliminate,
10:308:28967:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wage inequality.   Obviously,  these types of educated guesses vis-a-vis simulations must be taken with a
10:309:29072:20:20:72:174:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:proverbial grain of salt.
10:310:29097:20:21:88:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The chapter proceeds as follows.  Section 2 describes our method for culling and standardizing field
10:311:29197:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments from the education literature. Section 3 describes evidence from randomized field experiments
10:312:29302:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across  the  three  categories:  early  childhood,  home-based  interventions,  and  school-based  interventions.
10:313:29415:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Section 4 uses the estimates from the literature to simulate a life-cycle model and provide a sense of how
10:314:29521:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:much of racial wage inequality in America might be accounted for if government policy focused on the best
10:315:29626:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:practices gleaned from the literature.  Section 5 concludes.  There are 100 pages worth of Appendix Tables
11:316:29733:0:44:72:339:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that summarize the literature in a concise and consistent way.
11:317:29795:44:32:72:442:667:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:2    A Method for Finding and Evaluating Field Experiments
11:318:29853:32:20:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In deciding which field experiments to include in our analysis, we first culled a reasonably exhaustive list
11:319:29961:20:20:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of field experiments and then narrowed our focus to studies that satisfied certain criteria.   We began by
11:320:30067:20:21:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searching all “quick reviews” and “single study reviews” in the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC). WWC
11:321:30166:21:20:72:540:574:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was created by the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences in 2002.   Its goal is
11:322:30270:20:20:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to provide reviews of education studies, policies, and interventions in order for researchers to determine
11:323:30376:20:21:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:“what works” in education.  Currently,  WWC has over 10,500 reviews available in an online searchable
11:324:30477:21:20:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:database.  Eligible studies are reviewed by a team of WWC’s certified staff against WWC standards and

11:326:30687:20:21:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reservations.  This implies that groups compared in the study were determined through a random process,
11:327:30790:21:20:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there was low overall attrition from the sample, the differential attrition across groups was low, and there
11:328:30898:20:20:72:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were no confounding factors (U.S. Department of Education 2015).6Our search of WWC produced 115
11:329:30993:20:21:72:378:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomized field experiments that met standards without reservations.
11:330:31062:21:20:88:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We augmented the WWC search by looking through recent education literature reviews (e.g.  Almond
11:331:31158:20:20:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Currie 2011;  Fryer 2010;  Heckman and Kautz 2013;  Nye et al.  2006;  Yeager and Walton 2011) to
11:332:31259:20:21:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ensure that all these potential studies had been included.  In most all cases, the randomized studies were
11:333:31365:21:20:72:467:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:already in the What Works Clearhinghouse, but this process produced important additions.
11:334:31453:20:20:88:539:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we conducted relatively broad searches of known databases – such as ERIC, JSTOR, EconLit –
11:335:31552:20:21:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that include education papers to augment our sample of studies. In each database, we searched for all phases
11:336:31660:21:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generated by concatenating one element from the set of strings (“early childhood”, “education”, “housing”,
11:337:31766:20:20:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:“neighborhood”, “parent”, “school”, “student”, “teacher”) with one element from (“experiment”, “random
11:338:31868:20:21:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assignment”, “randomization”).  For each database, we collected all hits that searching for these 24 unique
11:339:31975:21:20:72:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:phrases returned.7These searches provided us with over 10,000 citations to check. To conduct this laborious
11:340:32082:20:20:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:task, we had a team of five research assistants skim every article and select papers that explicitly mention a
11:341:32192:20:20:71:307:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:random process determining the experimental sample.
11:342:32243:20:27:88:539:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using these approaches, we found 859 potential studies.  Table 1 describes how we narrowed our set
11:343:32341:27:14:87:539:121:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:6That is, no factor other than the intervention itself is present that all treatment students in one group are exposed to and no
11:344:32469:14:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:students in the comparison group are exposed to. If a confounding factor is present, it would be impossible to distinguish between
11:345:32599:11:8:72:272:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:the effect of the intervention and the effect of the factor.
11:346:32659:8:14:87:539:88:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:7JSTOR’s search algorithm occasionally returned thousands of results.  Due to resource and time constraints, we decided to
11:347:32781:14:0:72:393:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:only collect the top 200 (as determined by “relevance”) results for each phrase in JSTOR.
12:348:32871:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  studies  from  859  to  196.   As  discussed,  we  only  included  experiments  that  had  samples  determined
12:349:32985:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by a verifiably random process that were pre-college;  that took place in a highly developed country (as
12:350:33089:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:determined by the Human Development Index constructed by the United Nations Development Programme);
12:351:33188:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and that reported standardized reading or mathematics test scores as an outcome measure at posttest.  The
12:352:33293:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:random process is important for causal inference – though the rise of strong quasi-experimental analyses
12:353:33397:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:makes this quite restrictive. Some experiments use non-norm referenced tests designed by the experimenter
12:354:33502:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for  the  purpose  of  the  experiment.   These  evaluations  are  not  comparable  across  experiments  and  were
12:355:33616:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:omitted. In general, the restrictions are important for comparability and allow one to synthesize the estimates
12:356:33727:21:20:72:239:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the studies in the analysis below.
12:357:33766:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Unfortunately,  these  restrictions  lead  to  us  not  including  some  influential  experimental  studies.   For
12:358:33880:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example, our screening excluded the exploration of the impact of teacher value-added on students in Chetty
12:359:33986:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al.  (2014) because their research design is non-experimental.  Housing demolitions in Jacob (2004) and
12:360:34092:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the famous brown and blue eye experiments performed by Jane Elliot in her classrooms in the late 1960s also
12:361:34199:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did not utilize verifiably random processes. A well-known incentive experiment in Israel (Angrist and Lavy
12:362:34305:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2009) was excluded because the main outcome was receipt of matriculation certificates.  Similarly, many
12:363:34408:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important social-psychological, behavioral, and “mindset” experiments (e.g. Mischel et al. 1972; Cohen et
12:364:34513:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:al. 2006; Cohen et al. 2009; Wilson and Linville 1982; Aronson et al. 2002; Miyake et al. 2010; Duckworth
12:365:34618:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al. 2013) were excluded because they did not report results for standardized math or reading outcomes or
12:366:34725:20:20:72:216:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sample was post high school.
12:367:34757:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For each experiment that passed our screening, we report estimates of the annual pooled effect sizes
12:368:34857:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on reading and math outcomes, in standard deviations.  If papers did not report results in this manner, we
12:369:34963:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attempted to use the information given to calculate standardized effect sizes.  For example, if impacts were
12:370:35071:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:presented as scale score points on a test, we would divide the coefficient by the standard deviation given
12:371:35177:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the summary statistics.  The most common calculation we performed was using the average treatment
12:372:35277:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and control posttest scores (or changes between pretest and posttest) as well as the corresponding standard
12:373:35384:20:20:72:399:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deviations to calculate the standardized difference between the two groups.
12:374:35459:20:21:88:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Specifically, we used this information to calculate a statistic known as Hedge’sgand its corresponding
12:375:35561:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard error (see Hedges 1981 and Lipsey and Wilson 2000). Since this measure is just the difference be-
12:376:35667:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tween the average test scores of treatment and control groups, point estimates obtained from this method are
12:377:35775:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identical to intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates that do not include controls and use the same standard deviation
12:378:35884:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to standardize the test scores. Note that since all studies included in this paper used a random procedure to
12:379:35993:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assign treatment and control groups, point estimates from multivariable ITT regressions should not differ
13:380:36100:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significantly from the raw differences. If possible, when necessary information for this statistic was missing
13:381:36210:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we would make assumptions (e.g.  equal number of students assigned to treatment and control or use the
13:382:36312:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard deviation from the national sample of the standardized test).8If there was not enough information
13:383:36418:20:20:72:437:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:presented in the paper for us to make credible assumptions, the study was excluded.
13:384:36501:20:21:88:539:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:One common issue we encountered was the calculation of standard errors. Unfortunately, without having
13:385:36602:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:access to the micro-data, it was not possible to calculate the appropriate standard errors for every effect size.
13:386:36715:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In an attempt to not overstate the significance of an effect size, when calculating Hedge’sg, we erred on the
13:387:36824:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conservative side and used the number of units randomized to calculate the standard errors.  For example,
13:388:36929:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:although Slavin et al. (1984) had a sample of 504 students, randomization was done at the school level (N =
13:389:37036:20:44:72:84:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:6).

13:392:37119:28:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In the past five decades there have been many field experiments designed to increase achievement before

13:394:37322:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:papers), the ages they serve, and their treatment effects on standardized math and reading outcomes. Here,
13:395:37428:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we partition the literature into interventions that are early childhood center-based and others that are more
13:396:37537:20:36:71:126:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:home-based.

13:398:37581:28:20:71:539:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Perhaps the most famous early intervention program for children involved 123 students in Ypsilanti, Michi-
13:399:37687:20:21:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gan, who attended the Perry Preschool program in 1962 (58 were randomly assigned to treatment).  The
13:400:37787:21:20:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program consisted of a 2.5-hour daily preschool program and weekly home visits by teachers, and targeted
13:401:37891:20:20:71:539:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds with IQ scores in the range of 70-85.  An active
13:402:37993:20:21:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:learning curriculum - High/Scope - was used in the preschool program in order to support both the cognitive
13:403:38100:21:20:71:539:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and non-cognitive development of the children over the course of two years beginning when the children
13:404:38202:20:20:71:539:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were three years old. Schweinhart, Barnes, and Weikart (1993) find that students in the Perry Preschool pro-
13:405:38310:20:21:71:539:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gram had higher test scores between the ages of 5 and 27, 21 percent less grade retention or special services

14:409:38728:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dren in the control group.  Considering the financial benefits that are associated with the positive outcomes
14:410:38837:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the Perry Preschool, Heckman et al. (2010) estimated that the rate of return on the program is between 7
14:411:38944:21:20:72:324:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 10 percent, passing a traditional cost-benefit analysis.
14:412:39004:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although an influential experiment, Heckman et al.  (2009) argues that the randomization protocol for
14:413:39105:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Perry Preschool experiment was compromised.  Post-randomization,  some children initially assigned
14:414:39207:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to treatment whose parents were employed were swapped with control children whose parents were un-
14:415:39305:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employed.  The researchers’ rationale for this swap was that employed mothers would find it difficult to
14:416:39409:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:participate  in  the  home  visits  that  treatment  families  received.   Heckman  et  al.   (2010)  investigates  the
14:417:39528:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implications of these swaps and other potential issues with previously reported Perry results. Even after ac-

14:422:40023:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program is Head Start. Head Start is a preschool program funded by federal matching grants that is designed
14:423:40130:21:20:72:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to serve 3- to 5-year-old children living at or below the federal poverty level.10The program varies across

14:425:40344:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:only half-day.  In 2007, Head Start served over 900,000 children at an average annual cost of about $7,300

14:431:40880:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:language and literacy. For 3-year-olds, there were also small positive effects in the social-emotional domain
14:432:40989:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(0.13 to 0.18 standard deviations) and on overall health status (0.12 standard deviations).  Yet, by the time
14:433:41098:21:25:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the children who received Head Start services had completed first grade, almost all of the positive impact on
14:434:41207:25:14:84:539:198:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:10Local Head Start agencies are able to extend coverage to those meeting other eligibility criteria, such as those with disabilities
14:435:41339:14:8:72:423:184:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and those whose families report income between 100 and 130 percent of the federal poverty level.
14:436:41435:8:14:84:539:176:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:11Currie and Thomas (1995) use a national sample of children and compare children who attended a Head Start program with
14:437:41555:14:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:siblings who did not attend Head Start, based on the assumption that examining effects within the family unit will reduce selection
14:438:41686:11:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:bias. They find that those children who attended Head Start scored higher on preschool vocabulary tests but that for black students,
14:439:41818:11:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:these gains were lost by age ten.  Using the same analysis method with updated data, Garces et al.  (2002) find several positive
14:440:41946:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:outcomes associated with Head Start attendance. They conclude that there is a positive effect from Head Start on the probability of
14:441:42077:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:attending college and - for whites - the probability of graduating from high school.  For black children, Head Start led to a lower
14:442:42208:11:8:72:302:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:likelihood of being arrested or charged with a crime later in life.

14:444:42402:14:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:hood centers.  Roughly ninety percent of the treatment sample and forty-three percent of the control sample attended center-based

15:453:43242:20:21:71:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 1977.  Campbell and Ramey (1994) find that at age 12, those children who were randomly assigned
15:454:43341:21:20:71:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the project scored 5 points higher on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and 5-7 points higher on various
15:455:43446:20:36:71:431:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subscales of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery achievement test.

15:457:43555:28:20:71:539:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The most well known home-based field experiment in the early childhood years is the Nurse-Family Part-
15:458:43657:20:21:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nership. Through this program, low-income first-time mothers received home visits from a registered nurse
15:459:43762:21:20:71:539:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beginning early in the pregnancy and continued until the child is two years old – a total of fifty visits over the
15:460:43876:20:20:71:539:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first two years. The program aimed to encourage preventive health practices, reduce risky health behaviors,
15:461:43983:20:21:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:foster positive parenting practices, and improve the economic self-sufficiency of the family.  In a study of
15:462:44091:21:20:71:539:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the program in Denver in 1994-95, Olds et al. (2002) found that those children whose mothers had received
15:463:44196:20:20:71:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:home visits from nurses (but not those who received home visits from paraprofessionals) were less likely
15:464:44300:20:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to display language delays and had superior mental development at age two.  In a long-term evaluation of
15:465:44404:20:21:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the program, Olds et al. (1998) found that children born to women who received nurse home visits between
15:466:44508:21:20:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1978 and 1980 had fewer juvenile arrests, convictions, and violations of probation by age fifteen than those
15:467:44616:20:20:71:258:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whose mothers had not received treatment.
15:468:44657:20:21:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Early Training Project provided children from low-income homes with summertime experiences
15:469:44751:21:20:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and weekly home visits during the three summers before entering first grade in an attempt to improve the
15:470:44855:20:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children’s school readiness.  Gray and Klaus (1970) report that children who received these intervention
15:471:44959:20:21:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:services maintained higher Stanford-Binet IQ scores (2-5 points) at the end of fourth grade.   The Infant

15:473:45167:20:20:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provided them with weekly home visits during the child’s first year and biweekly visits through age three,
15:474:45273:20:31:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as well as enhanced early childhood educational care and bimonthly parent group meetings. Brooks-Gunn,

15:476:45498:14:0:72:411:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:with infants and toddlers, had similar effects (Administration for Children and Families 2006).
16:477:45595:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Liaw, and Klebanov (1992) report that this program had positive effects on language development at the
16:478:45697:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:end of first grade, with participant children scoring 0.09 standard deviations higher on receptive vocabulary
16:479:45806:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 0.08 standard deviations higher on oral comprehension. The Milwaukee Project targeted newborns born
16:480:45909:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to women with IQs lower than 80;  mothers received education,  vocational rehabilitation,  and child care

16:482:46120:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at “infant stimulation centers” for seven hours a day, five days a week until the children were six years old.
16:483:46230:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Garber (1988) finds that this program resulted in an increase of 23 points on the Stanford-Binet IQ test at
16:484:46337:20:21:72:332:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:age six for treatment children compared to control children.
16:485:46397:21:20:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although the above parenting programs have shown promise, they are not widely accessible due to the
16:486:46496:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time demands they place on parents and high implementation costs.  York and Loeb (2014) investigate the
16:487:46599:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impact of READY4K!, a low-cost text message program that targets parents of preschoolers. The program
16:488:46700:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:helps these parents support their children’s literacy development by sending parents three text messages
16:489:46804:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:per week for an entire school year.  These texts were designed to provide parents with information on the
16:490:46909:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:importance of their children developing particular skills, tips on how to support their children’s development
16:491:47019:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in a cost-effective manner, and encouragement. York and Loeb (2014) recruited parents from 31 preschool
16:492:47122:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sites run by the San Francisco Unified School District’s Early Education Department.  Of the 874 eligible
16:493:47227:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:families, 440 enrolled and were randomly assigned to treatment group that participated in READY4K! or a
16:494:47330:21:20:72:134:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control group.
16:495:47344:20:20:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:At the end of the school year, York and Loeb (2014) collected survey responses from parents and teachers
16:496:47448:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to investigate the intervention’s impact on parental involvement. They found that treatment parents engaged
16:497:47555:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in literacy activities at home with their child 0.22 to 0.34 standard deviations more than control parents and
16:498:47665:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were 0.13 to 0.19 standard deviations more involved at preschool.  To investigate the impact the interven-
16:499:47771:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tion had on children’s literacy development, York and Loeb (2014) collected scores from the Phonological
16:500:47875:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS), a criterion-referenced test the school district administers to its early
16:501:47984:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:education students every spring.14They found that children in treatment families score 0.344 standard devi-
16:502:48091:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ations higher on the letter sounds subtest and 0.205 standard deviations higher on a measure of lower-case
16:503:48197:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alphabet knowledge.  However, there were no significant impacts on measures of name writing, upper-case
16:504:48300:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:letter knowledge, beginning word sounds, print and word awareness, rhyme awareness, and a summed score
16:505:48402:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of all the PALS subtests. For the sample of students that progressed to higher level subtests of PALS, there
16:506:48510:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were significant impacts on the upper-case letter subtest and the summed score. There was limited evidence
16:507:48616:21:24:72:380:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that READY4K! had differential impacts across family characteristics.
16:508:48685:24:0:84:539:77:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:14Note that since this study did not report results from a norm-referenced outcome, it was not included in our tables and analysis.
17:509:48818:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Fryer, Levitt, and List (2015) conducted a parental incentive experiment in Chicago Heights – a proto-
17:510:48920:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:typical low performing urban school district – by starting a parent academy that distributed nearly $1 million
17:511:49030:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to 257 families (these numbers include treatment and control). There were two treatment groups, which dif-
17:512:49136:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fered only in when families were rewarded, and a control group.  Parents in the two treatment groups were
17:513:49241:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:paid for attendance at Parent Academy sessions which were designed as information sessions to aid parents
17:514:49346:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in educating their children, proof of homework completion, and the performance of their children on bench-
17:515:49452:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mark assessments. The only difference between the two treatment groups is that parents in one group were
17:516:49556:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:paid in cash or via direct deposits (hereafter the “cash” condition) and parents in the second group received
17:517:49665:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the majority of their incentive payments via deposits into a trust account which can only be accessed if and
17:518:49773:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when the child enrolls in college (the “college” incentive condition).   Eleven project managers and staff
17:519:49879:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:worked together to ensure that parents understood the particulars of the treatment; that the parent academy
17:520:49986:21:20:72:528:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program was implemented with high fidelity; and that payments were distributed on time and accurately.
17:521:50088:20:20:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Across the entire sample, the impact on cognitive test scores of being offered a chance to participate in
17:522:50193:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the parental incentive is 0.119σ(with a standard error of 0.094). These estimates are non-trivial, but smaller
17:523:50303:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in magnitude than some classroom based interventions. For instance, the impact of Head Start on test scores
17:524:50410:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is approximately 0.145σ. The impact of the Perry Preschool intervention on achievement at 14 years old is
17:525:50515:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.203σ. Given the imprecision of the estimates, however, our results are statistically indistinguishable both
17:526:50624:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from these programs and from zero.  The impact of the “college” and “cash” incentive schemes are nearly
17:527:50727:20:20:72:112:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identical.
17:528:50737:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Fryer,  Levitt,  and  List  (2015)  report  that  the  impact  of  being  offered  a  chance  to  participate  in  our
17:529:50855:20:21:72:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parental  incentive  scheme  on  non-cognitive  skills  is  large  and  statistically  significant  (0.203σ(0.083)).
17:530:50971:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These results are consistent with Kautz et al.  (2014), who argue that parental investment is an important
17:531:51077:20:20:72:537:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contributor to non-cognitive development. Again, the “cash” and “college” schemes yield identical results.
17:532:51183:20:21:88:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:They complement our main statistical analysis by estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across a
17:533:51283:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variety of pre-determined subsamples that we blocked on experimentally.  Two stark patterns appear in the
17:534:51388:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data.  The first pattern is along racial lines:  Hispanics (48 percent of the sample) and whites (8 percent of
17:535:51498:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sample) demonstrate large and significant increases in both cognitive and non-cognitive domains.  For
17:536:51603:21:20:72:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instance, the impact of the parent academy for Hispanic children is 0.367σ(0.133) on our cognitive score
17:537:51707:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:and 0.428σ(0.122) on our non-cognitive score. Among the small sample of whites, the impacts are 0.932σ
17:538:51809:20:21:72:539:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(0.353) on cognitive and 0.821σ(0.181) on non-cognitive.  The identical estimates for blacks are actually
17:539:51914:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negative but statistically insignificant on both cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions:−0.234σ(0.134)
17:540:52016:20:0:71:539:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and−0.059σ(0.129), respectively.  Importantly, p-values on the differences between races are statistically
18:541:52124:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significant at conventional levels.  We explore a range of possible hypotheses regarding the source of the
18:542:52230:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:racial differences (extent of engagement with the program, demographics, English proficiency, pre-treatment
18:543:52337:21:20:72:394:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores), but none provide a convincing explanation of the complete effect.
18:544:52411:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The second pattern of heterogeneity in treatment that we observe in the data relates to pre-treatment test
18:545:52517:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores. Students who enter our program below the median on non-cognitive skills see no benefits from our
18:546:52621:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention in either the cognitive or non-cognitive domain. In stark contrast, students who enter our parent

18:549:52949:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-cognitive pre-treatment scores,  the greatest gains are made on both the cognitive and non-cognitive

18:553:53200:27:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Early  childhood  interventions  have  amassed  considerable  popular  and  political  support.   Yet,  like  other
18:554:53315:21:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initiatives to improve human capital, they are not a panacea.  For example, St.  Pierre et al.  (1997) find no
18:555:53425:20:20:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive effects in a national evaluation of the Comprehensive Child Development Program (CCDP). The
18:556:53525:20:21:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:CCDP delivers early and comprehensive services to low-income families with the aim of enhancing the
18:557:53624:21:20:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:development of the children in these families and helping the parents achieve economic self-sufficiency.
18:558:53728:20:20:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The CCDP model revolves around the ideas that one should intervene as early as possible in children’s lives,

18:561:54050:21:20:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and social self-sufficiency, and ensure that families have access to all of these resources until their children
18:562:54162:20:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:enter elementary school. In their evaluation, St. Pierre et al. (1997) found no significant differences between
18:563:54273:20:21:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:families that were randomly assigned to a CCDP treatment group or a control group. CCDP had no impacts
18:564:54375:21:20:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on measures of mothers’ economic self-sufficiency or their parenting skills and CCDP had no effects on the
18:565:54481:20:20:72:419:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cognitive or social emotional development of the children included in the study.
18:566:54561:20:21:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Still, early childhood investments are considered to be one of the least risky ways to increase academic
18:567:54665:21:20:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement (Heckman 2008).  Combining the 44 randomized studies in early childhood over the past 50
18:568:54765:20:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years,  the  random  effects  coefficients  are  0.111σ(0.031)  for  math  interventions  and  0.189σ(0.027)  for
18:569:54878:20:21:71:539:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading.  Of the 64 treatment effects recorded in these randomized studies, 21 were statistically positive;
18:570:54985:21:21:71:448:98:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:zero were statistically negative and 43 were statistically indistinguishable from zero.15
18:571:55074:21:0:84:468:77:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:A:15We consider an effect size statistically positive or negative if it is statistically significant at the 10% level.

19:573:55215:28:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There is an ongoing debate as to whether efficient production of human capital should focus on improving
19:574:55319:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the environment in which a child lives or the environment in which they learn.  Proponents of the school-

19:577:55641:20:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the community-focused approach argue that teachers and school administrators are dealing with issues that
19:578:55746:20:21:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:originate outside the classroom, citing research that shows racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps are
19:579:55851:21:20:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formed before children ever enter school (Fryer and Levitt 2004; 2006), that mother’s IQ is highly correlated
19:580:55960:20:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with child achievement (Fryer and Levitt 2013; Wilson and Matheny 1983; Yeates et al. 1983) and that one-
19:581:56065:20:21:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:third to one-half of the racial achievement gap can be explained by family-environment indicators (Phillips
19:582:56172:21:20:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al.  1998; Fryer and Levitt 2004).  In this scenario, combating poverty and having more constructive out-
19:583:56280:20:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of-school time may lead to better and more-focused instruction in school.  Indeed, Coleman et al.  (1966),
19:584:56386:20:21:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in their famous report on the equality of educational opportunity, argue that schools alone cannot treat the
19:585:56494:21:20:72:315:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:problem of chronic underachievement in urban schools.
19:586:56547:20:20:88:539:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this subsection, we describe several attempts to provide households with more resources and to com-

19:588:56757:21:20:72:540:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:approximation to the “intensity” of treatment received – which ranges from providing parents with infor-

19:592:57057:28:20:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Parents matter. Using data from a national, cross-sectional study of children aged 8-12, Davis-Kean (2005)
19:593:57163:20:21:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:found significant correlations between parents’ characteristics and parenting practices and students’ math
19:594:57269:21:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and reading achievement.   Specifically,  Davis-Kean (2005) found that strong correlations with students’
19:595:57374:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement existed for parents’ education levels, income, parental expectations, number of books owned,
19:596:57478:20:21:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and many parental behaviors such as being warm and affectionate, responding positively, and giving praise.
19:597:57584:21:20:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Jeynes (2005) conducts a meta-analysis of 41 studies that investigate the impact of parental involvement on

19:599:57793:20:21:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an effect size on elementary students’ academic outcomes of about 0.7 standard deviations.  Jeynes (2007)
19:600:57898:21:20:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conducts a similar meta-analysis using 52 studies that focus on secondary school students and finds the
19:601:58001:20:0:72:372:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect size of parent involvement to be about 0.5 standard deviations.
20:602:58073:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although these results are interesting, they are are not causal estimates of the impact of parental involve-
20:603:58181:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment on students’ outcomes. Levels of parental involvement are most likely correlated with many observable
20:604:58287:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and unobservable characteristics of the parents and it is exceedingly difficult to rid these estimates of thorny
20:605:58399:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:issues of selection.  Moreover, even if these estimates were causal, it is not obvious that it is possible for
20:606:58509:20:21:72:499:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interventions to change parents’ involvement to achieve these positive impacts on child outcomes.
20:607:58606:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In what follows,  we summarize the literature on experiments to increase parental involvement using

20:611:58867:20:20:72:540:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Avvisati et al. (2014) conducted an experimental study on middle school students and parents in the educa-

20:613:59080:21:20:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools were offered a parental education program that taught parents how they can assist in their child’s
20:614:59186:20:20:72:160:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:educational process.
20:615:59206:20:21:88:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper was motivated by a strong perception that disadvantaged parents have inadequate knowledge
20:616:59306:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  confidence  to  be  effective  advocates  for  their  children.   The  experiment  sought  to  test  if  this  could
20:617:59427:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be improved by a simple intervention.  The experimental program consisted of three afterschool meetings
20:618:59530:20:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with parents, conducted by the school head.  The first two sessions focused on how parents can help their
20:619:59635:20:21:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children’s education by participating at home and at school.  The final session, which took place after the
20:620:59742:21:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:end-of-term report card, focused on how parents can adapt to their children’s first term results.  Of the 352
20:621:59851:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state-run middle schools in the Creteil district, 34 schools volunteered to participate in the program. Around
20:622:59961:20:21:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two-thirds of schools in the study were “priority education”, a label indicating a historically disadvantaged
20:623:60070:21:20:72:93:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:area.
20:624:60075:20:20:88:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Parents of 6th graders in the participating middle schools were asked,  over a 6-week period,  if they
20:625:60177:20:21:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would like to sign up for the informational meetings.  After the sign-up period closed, the list of registered
20:626:60287:21:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:families constituted the “volunteer families,” creating two populations within each class in each school.
20:627:60392:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There were no strong observable pre-treatment differences between volunteer and non-volunteer families.
20:628:60495:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:After registration closed, randomization began at the class-level of each school (meaning that roughly half
20:629:60602:21:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of all classes were treated within each school).  The randomization process defined four basic groups of
20:630:60706:20:20:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:families within each school: volunteers in treatment classes, non-volunteers in treatment classes, volunteers
20:631:60815:20:21:72:317:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in control classes, and non-volunteers in control classes.
20:632:60873:21:0:88:539:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The study was interested in addressing three outcomes:  (1) parental involvement attitudes and behav-

21:634:61085:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:academic results.   To measure parental involvement attitudes and behavior,  all families received a ques-
21:635:61191:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tionnaire on school-based involvement,  home-based involvement,  and parents’ perception of the school.
21:636:61294:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Student outcomes were reported by teachers and academic reports. Main subject teachers were also given a
21:637:61398:20:21:72:458:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:questionnaire regarding both parental attitudes and child’s behavior/school performance.
21:638:61486:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The evidence found that the program was successful in significantly improving volunteer parent atti-
21:639:61586:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tudes.  Based on parents’ and teachers’ questionnaires, parental involvement by volunteer parents in treat-
21:640:61693:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment classes increased. Children of volunteer parents in treatment classes saw a vast improvement in school
21:641:61800:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attitudes and discipline compared to control classes: truancy was lower by 1.1 half-days, treatment students
21:642:61908:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were 4.6 percentage points less likely to be punished for disciplinary reasons (6.4% versus 11.0%), more
21:643:62012:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely to earn top marks for conduct, and, according to teacher questionnaire answers, were more likely to
21:644:62118:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be agreeable in class and work diligently.  In addition to having a direct impact on the students whose par-
21:645:62226:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ents volunteered to participate, there were also spillover effects on students in treatment classrooms whose
21:646:62334:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parents did not participate.  Treatment had a statistically significant impact on non-volunteer students’ ab-
21:647:62443:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:senteeism, probability of disciplinary sanctions, and marks for conduct.  For students of volunteer parents,
21:648:62551:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment increased average grades across all subjects by 0.08 standard deviations and increased academic
21:649:62656:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performance as measured by the teacher survey.  However, the intervention had no impact on grades for
21:650:62757:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students whose parents did not volunteer and the intervention had no impacts on standardized test scores for
21:651:62865:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any students. The findings overall suggested that parental involvement can be a significant input in student
21:652:62973:20:20:72:359:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement—mostly through an impact on behavioral outcomes.

21:654:63138:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dents’ academic outcomes using parental interventions. Other parental experiments that focus on improving
21:655:63243:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students’ academic outcomes through parental tutoring also tend to have insignificant impacts on academic

22:664:63944:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was an experiment conducted in Mexico in 1998, which provided cash incentives linked to health, nutrition
22:665:64049:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and education. The largest component of PROGRESA was linked to school attendance and enrollment. The
22:666:64149:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program provided cash payments to mothers in targeted households to keep their children in school (Skoufias
22:667:64256:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2005).  Programs based on the PROGRESA model have been replicated in New York City, Nicaragua, and

22:669:64363:21:20:88:542:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Beginning in 1997, the Mexican government identified 506 rural communities on the basis of a “marginal-
22:670:64466:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ity  index” gleaned from census  data.   Socio-economic data was collected from  households within these
22:671:64570:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:communities to target households living in extreme poverty.  In 1998, about two thirds of the identified lo-
22:672:64678:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:calities were randomly selected to receive financial incentives under PROGRESA; the remaining localities
22:673:64782:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:served as controls.  As a part of the program, households could receive up to $62.50 per month if children
22:674:64888:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attended school regularly. The amount of incentive was higher for older children who had to attend 85% of
22:675:64993:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all school days. The average amount of incentives received by any treatment household in the first two years
22:676:65101:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of treatment was $34.80, which was 21% of an average household’s income.  Besides school attendance,
22:677:65201:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:PROGRESA also emphasized actual student achievement by making a child ineligible for the program if
22:678:65300:21:20:72:351:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:she failed a grade more than once (Skoufias 2005; Slavin 2010).

22:680:65460:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:girls in primary and secondary school.  For primary school children, PROGRESA increased school enroll-
22:681:65562:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment for boys by 1.1 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points for girls from a baseline level of approxi-
22:682:65670:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mately 90 percent. For secondary school students, enrollment increased by 7.2 to 9.3 percentage points for
22:683:65776:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:boys and 3.5 to 5.8 percentage points for girls, from a baseline level of approximately 70%. The author also
22:684:65884:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reports that PROGRESA had an accumulated effect of 0.66 years additional schooling for a student from
22:685:65985:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the average poor household. Taking the baseline level of schooling at face value, PROGRESA’s 0.66 years
22:686:66088:20:20:72:395:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:accumulated effect translates into a 10% increase in schooling attainment.

22:688:66260:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school at an earlier age, had less grade repetition and better grade progression. Treatment children also had
22:689:66369:20:20:72:492:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lower dropout rates and once dropped out, they had a higher chance of re-entry into high school.

22:691:66561:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was conducted in New York City. The program had three components: the Family Rewards component that
22:692:66660:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gave incentives for to parents to fulfill responsibilities towards their children; the Work Rewards component
22:693:66769:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that  gave  incentives  for  families  to  work;  and  the  Spark  component  that  gave  incentives  to  students  to
22:694:66887:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase achievement scores in classes. The program began in August 2007 and ended in August 2010 (see

23:697:67122:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years of treatment.  Their analysis is based on 4,800 families with 11,000 children out of which half were
23:698:67228:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assigned to treatment and the other half to control.  Opportunity NYC spent $8,700 per family in treatment
23:699:67334:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over three years. The experiment had an insignificant impact on every school outcome measured (Riccio et

23:702:67483:27:21:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Education,  like  other  industries,  has  evolved  over  the  past  few  decades  –  due,  in  part,  to  technological
23:703:67603:21:20:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change. With the introduction of computers, the internet, mobile wifi, and smart phones, teaching strategies
23:704:67711:20:20:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have changed to utilize these technologies in the classroom.  However, many children still lack access to
23:705:67816:20:21:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these resources in their homes.  One could imagine that the returns to household computers are quite high.
23:706:67922:21:20:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Students  can  use  them  as  a  tool  to  efficiently  complete  assignments,  learn  new  information,  study,  and
23:707:68039:20:20:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:use for other educational purposes.  Despite these potential returns, it is also possible that households face
23:708:68149:20:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constraints (e.g.  credit or information) that prevent them from investing in household technology.  This is
23:709:68257:21:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supported by the fact that ownership of household computers and access to household internet is correlated

23:719:69258:21:20:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years.  No students who participated in the study had home computers at baseline.  Half of these students
23:720:69363:20:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were randomly selected to receive free computers without any training or technological assistance.  Fairlie
23:721:69470:20:21:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Robinson collected administrative data on student academic outcomes and demographics pretreatment

23:723:69677:20:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:surveys that included questions about computer usage,  knowledge,  homework time,  and other important
23:724:69779:20:21:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes.  Using this data, Fairlie and Robinson found that the experiment had large first-stage impacts.
23:725:69884:21:20:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:They found that treatment students were 55 percentage points more likely to have a computer at follow-up,

24:727:70095:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:per week than control students’ average of 4.2 hours, and almost all of this additional usage came from a
24:728:70200:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:computer at home. However, not all of the computer usage was for educational purposes. Relative to control
24:729:70306:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students, treatment students used computers 0.80 hours more per week for schoolwork (control mean (CM)
24:730:70408:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was 1.89 hours), 0.42 hours more for e-mail (CM = 0.25 hours), 0.80 hours more for games (CM = 0.84

24:736:70998:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or “B” with 95 percent confidence. Using quantile regressions, they show that these null effects exist across
24:737:71107:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the entire posttreatment achievement distribution.  Similarly, they find no evidence of impact on students’

24:741:71539:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects are consistent with survey results that show treatment students did not change intermediate inputs

24:745:71949:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that summer vacation is a critical time for forming and widening achievement gaps in reading, particularly

24:750:72482:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:its own superintendent. To be included in the sample, the subdistrict needed to contain high-poverty schools
24:751:72590:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that administered Title I school-wide programs and contain multi-racial schools in which reading scores

24:753:72800:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:included four Title I schools and the six non-Title I schools with the largest percentage of minority students.

25:763:73842:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:free books to read during the summer.  Students’ reading levels were based on performance on the reading

25:766:74153:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:each student’s independent reading level using information about each student’s reading level and reading
25:767:74258:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:preferences. With each book, students also received a postcard that asked students to check comprehension
25:768:74363:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strategies used while reading the book and to obtain a signature from a parent or family member after reading
25:769:74472:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a portion of the book aloud to the adult.  Parents were instructed to mail each postcard back to the schools,
25:770:74581:20:21:72:314:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regardless of if their student completed the book or not.
25:771:74638:21:20:88:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A total of 552 students received consent to participate in the study and took pretests in June 2005. These
25:772:74744:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (282 treatment and 270 control) within

25:774:74954:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the two groups at the beginning of the experiment on numerous demographic and achievement
25:775:75051:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics. Because of attrition, the final sample included 486 students (252 treatment and 234 control)
25:776:75160:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the beginning of the Fall in 2005.   The intervention attempts to improve reading skills by increasing
25:777:75265:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children’s access to books, matching books to children’s reading levels and preferences, and encouraging
25:778:75369:20:20:72:349:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children to read orally with a parent/family member to practice.
25:779:75433:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To investigate if the intervention increased children’s access to books at home and literacy-related activ-
25:780:75540:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ities during summer vacation, the author used a two-way ANOVA on both self-reported measures of book
25:781:75640:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ownership and on literacy habits gathered from a survey conducted at the end of the summer.  The results
25:782:75744:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that the intervention did not increase children’s access to books nor the amount of silent reading.
25:783:75851:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However,  children  in  the  treatment  group  reported  significantly  more  oral-reading  at  home  with  family

25:786:76175:20:21:72:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, treatment had a 0.08σ(0.04) impact on students’ standardized reading test scores and there were
25:787:76279:21:20:72:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differential effects by race. Treatment increased test scores by 0.22σ(0.09) for black students, 0.14σ(0.08)
25:788:76387:20:20:72:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for Latino students, and 0.17σ(0.11) for Asian students. Further, the magnitude of the treatment effect was
25:789:76494:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:largest among lower performing students, and there were no significant interactions between the treatment
25:790:76599:21:24:72:309:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and measures of reading ability or ownership of books

26:806:78063:21:20:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can account for large proportions of raw racial achievement gaps (Duncan and Magnuson 2005; Fryer and

26:812:78477:21:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:educational achievement by altering home environment: product inputs and time inputs. Product inputs are
26:813:78581:20:20:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:things such as food, health care, and books.  Examples of time inputs are time parents spend talking to,
26:814:78685:20:21:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:playing with, and reading to their children. They assume that product inputs are positively related to family
26:815:78794:21:20:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income and that time inputs are positively related to time not working.  Maynard and Murnane investigate
26:816:78898:20:20:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the educational impacts of a program that affects both of these mechanisms in unison by increasing families’

26:820:79251:20:21:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Public Welfare.  Families who voluntarily enrolled and had at least one child under the age of 18 were
26:821:79356:21:0:72:540:74:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomly assigned to negative income tax conditions or control.  Of the 1,799 eligible families, 57 percent
27:822:79465:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were assigned to one of four negative income tax plans for three years. These tax plans were a combination
27:823:79571:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of two tax rates (40 or 60 percent) and two guaranteed income levels (about three fourths of the poverty level
27:824:79681:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or equal to the poverty level). The lower guarantee level was about $1,000 a year more than the support level

27:838:81084:20:21:71:505:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no evidence that treatment had an impact on the number of days absent for either group of students.
27:839:81183:21:20:88:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To better understand these results, Maynard and Murnane also investigate the mechanisms by which the
27:840:81283:20:20:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiment might have affected school performance.  They found that the Gary experiment had a signifi-
27:841:81385:20:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cant first stage impact on total family income, but caused minimal change in the number of hours worked.
27:842:81489:20:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Treatment families on average had their incomes increased by $2,000 per year (approximately a 50 percent
27:843:81593:21:20:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase).  For married mothers, there was no change in hours worked per week.  For female family heads,
27:844:81697:20:20:71:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there was a decrease of about two hours per week.  Additionally, experimental families that lived in public
27:845:81804:20:21:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:housing before randomization were more likely to move to private dwellings than control families that lived
27:846:81911:21:20:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in public housing prior to randomization.  However, there was no statistical difference in mobility in the

27:850:82147:21:20:71:539:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Project (SSP), that attempted to make work more appealing than welfare to long-time welfare recipients in

28:859:82964:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The study randomly assigned 6,000 single parents from British Columbia and New Brunswick,  who
28:860:83058:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had been on income assistance for at least one year, to a treatment and control group.  Treatment parents
28:861:83163:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were eligible to participate in SSP and control parents were not. Parents enrolled in SSP received a monthly
28:862:83271:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:earnings supplement conditional on starting a full-time job and leaving income assistance.  The earnings
28:863:83375:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supplement was in addition to earnings from employment for up three years, as long as the parent continued
28:864:83481:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be employed full-time and remained off of income assistance. After random assignment, treatment parents
28:865:83587:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had one year to find full-time employment (at least 30 hours per week) and leave income assistance to enroll
28:866:83695:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in  SSP.  After  enrollment,  the  supplement  participants  received  was  half  of  the  difference  between  their
28:867:83812:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:earnings and an earnings benchmark (the benchmark varied by location and year, but was $30,000 in New
28:868:83913:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Brunswick and $37,000 in British Columbia for the first year of the experiment). This supplement was not
28:869:84017:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:affected by unearned income, earnings of other family members, and number of children. This supplement
28:870:84119:20:21:72:346:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would essentially double the wage of many low-wage workers.
28:871:84178:21:20:88:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Michalopoulos et al.  (2002) found significant first-stage impacts.  Thirty-six percent of single parents
28:872:84283:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that were offered participation found full-time employment and took-up the supplement during the year
28:873:84384:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long eligibility window. Of those that participated in SSP, the average parent received the supplement for 22
28:874:84493:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:months over the three years of the program and received more than $18,000 in supplements over that that
28:875:84596:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time.  SSP increased treatment parents’ probability of employment throughout the duration of the program
28:876:84700:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and reduced income assistance payments received by these families.  As a result, treatment parents earned
28:877:84805:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nearly $3,400 more than control members.  Total income (supplements, earnings, and income assistance)
28:878:84906:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased by $6,300 for the average treatment family.  These impacts reduced the proportion of treatment
28:879:85010:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parents below Canada’s low income cut-offs by 10 percentage points.  Although these large impacts were
28:880:85112:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observed during the program, these impacts did not persist after the completion of SSP. By six years af-
28:881:85216:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ter random assignment (two years after all treatment parents would have stopped receiving supplements),
28:882:85319:20:20:72:504:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment and control parents were equally likely to be employed and had similar average earnings.
28:883:85417:20:21:88:539:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Michalopoulos et al. (2002) also investigated the impact of SSP on the outcomes of the parents’ children.
28:884:85522:21:24:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:They found differential treatment effects by the age of the child at the beginning of treatment. For children
28:885:85631:24:0:84:352:77:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:A:19Statistics come from the 2011 Canadian census (Statistics Canada 2013).
29:886:85706:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:who were 1 or 2 years old at the time of random assignment, SSP had no effects on their performance on
29:887:85808:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a standardized test of vocabulary skills (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) and achievement as reported by
29:888:85913:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parents.  For children who were 3 or 4, SSP increased students’ scores on a math skills test and parental-
29:889:86019:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reported achievement. Treatment children who were 13, 14, or 15 at the time of random assignment reported
29:890:86124:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:doing worse in school and committing more minor acts of delinquency during the program, but these effects
29:891:86229:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:faded away after parents were no longer eligible for the supplement.  Finally, for older adolescents, SSP
29:892:86334:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had no impacts on educational, crime, or work related outcomes, but these students were significantly more
29:893:86440:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:likely to have babies.  Other than the effects stated above for the young adolescents, there was no evidence
29:894:86548:21:20:72:514:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of SSP having any impacts on health, behavior, and the emotional well-being of students in the study.
29:895:86649:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In a large analysis of welfare-to-work programs in the U.S., Hamilton et al.  (2001) conduct a national
29:896:86752:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluation of the long-term effects of 11 welfare-to-work programs on the recipients and their children. The
29:897:86860:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluation investigates the effectiveness of two different types of pre-employment strategies, Labor Force
29:898:86966:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Attachment (LFA) and Human Capital Development (HCD). LFA welfare-to-work programs typically con-
29:899:87063:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sist of short-term job search and encourage welfare participants to find employment quickly. HCD programs
29:900:87168:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:emphasize investment in longer-term skills and typically encourage participants to enroll in training or basic
29:901:87278:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:education programs. Hamilton et al. (2001) use data on over 40,000 single parents (mostly female) and their
29:902:87385:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:children who were randomly assigned to these programs in sites across the nation to investigate the impact
29:903:87491:21:20:72:192:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of LFA and HCD programs
29:904:87514:20:20:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Over the course of the five-year follow-up period, a majority of control group members worked at some
29:905:87615:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point.  For example, 88 percent of the control parents from the Grand Rapids site were employed at some
29:906:87718:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point.   In  Oklahoma  City,  79  percent  worked  at  some  point  during  that  time  and  66  percent  worked  in
29:907:87834:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Riverside. Although there was a high percentage of control parents that ever worked, treatment parents still
29:908:87942:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:worked during more calendar quarters on average than control parents in 9 of 11 programs. Similarly, in 9 of
29:909:88050:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:11 programs, treatment parents on average had higher total earnings. Typically, Hamilton et al. (2001) found
29:910:88158:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that employment-focused programs produced employment and earnings effects almost immediately while
29:911:88256:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:education focused programs did not have effects until a year or more after randomization.  However, when
29:912:88360:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:directly comparing the LFA and HCD programs in the sites where they were run side by side, employment
29:913:88461:21:20:72:318:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and earnings levels over the five years were very similar.
29:914:88519:20:20:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:By the end of the follow-up period,  almost all control families were off of welfare and the average
29:915:88619:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control group member remained on assistance for only 2 to 3 years.  However, both treatment types still
29:916:88722:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reduced months on welfare relative to the control averages and there is some evidence that LFA treatment
29:917:88826:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:members left welfare assistance at a faster pace than HCD participants.  These reductions in welfare usage
30:918:88934:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:appear to directly offset the increase in salary. Despite increasing earnings, treatment largely had no impact
30:919:89044:20:21:72:535:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on total combined income (earnings, welfare and Food Stamp payments, and Earned Income Tax Credits).
30:920:89144:21:20:88:539:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Hamilton et al.  (2001) also investigate if the welfare-to-work programs had effects on family circum-
30:921:89246:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stances and children’s well-being.  They found that there was no evidence of impacts on health care cover-
30:922:89352:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:age, marriage rates, and few impacts on household composition and living arrangements.  However, adults
30:923:89455:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assigned to a welfare-to-work program were less likely to report recent physical abuse at the end of the
30:924:89559:20:20:72:124:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiment.
30:925:89570:20:21:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To investigate impacts on children,  the researchers conducted a Child Outcomes Study in six of the
30:926:89669:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs (three different sites that each offered LFA and HCD programs).  These studies included almost
30:927:89772:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:50 measures of children’s academic functioning, health, social skills, and behavior for children who were
30:928:89877:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:preschool  age  at  randomization.   The  authors  report  that  15  percent  of  these  tests  produced  statistically
30:929:89996:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significant differences, but the sign and magnitudes were rarely consistent across sites.  For example, the
30:930:90103:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates from the Atlanta LFA and HCD programs suggested favorable impacts on social skills and be-
30:931:90203:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:havior for young children, but the Grand Rapids programs revealed negative effects. For older children, the
30:932:90310:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs led to few significant results. However, whenever results for these students were significant, they
30:933:90418:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tended to be unfavorable.  For example, a HCD program at one site increased the likelihood of dropping
30:934:90520:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:out, increased percentage of adolescents who had a physical, emotional, or mental condition that impeded
30:935:90624:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their mother’s ability to go to work, and increased teenage pregnancies among families with lower levels of
30:936:90731:20:32:72:514:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:education. Note again that no effects varied consistently by program approach or site for adolescents.
30:937:90833:32:20:88:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Summarizing the literature on poverty reduction attempts to increase student achievement, the meta-
30:938:90932:20:21:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients for this strand of literature are 0.008σ(0.029) and 0.016σ(0.024).  And, perhaps more telling,

30:941:91184:28:20:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A more nuanced version of the “poverty is first-order” argument is that the mechanism by which disad-
30:942:91285:20:20:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vantage affects achievement is not directly through income – hence, addressing the income problem has no
30:943:91389:20:21:71:539:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:real impact – but through what sociologists refer to as “a culture of poverty.” This theory argues that the
30:944:91496:21:20:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:poor are not simply lacking resources, but are also immersed in a culture that develops mechanisms or has
30:945:91601:20:20:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:social institutions that perpetuate poverty (Moynihan 1969; Harrignton 1982). Taking the culture of poverty

31:949:92039:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:precisely what the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomized housing mobility experiment did – one of the
31:950:92141:21:20:72:289:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:most pathbreaking experiments of our generation.
31:951:92189:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:From 1994 to 1998, MTO enrolled 4,604 poor families with children residing in public housing in high-
31:952:92290:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:poverty neighborhoods of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City.  Families were
31:953:92389:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomly assigned to three groups: (1) the experimental voucher group, which received a restricted housing
31:954:92495:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voucher that could be used to pay for private rental housing initially restricted to be in a low-poverty area
31:955:92604:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(a census tract with under a 10 percent poverty rate in 1990) and some housing-mobility counseling; (2) the
31:956:92711:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Section-8 only voucher group, which received regular Section 8 housing vouchers with no MTO relocation
31:957:92813:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constraint; and (3) a control group, which received no assistance through MTO. Across the MTO treatment
31:958:92916:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sites, 61 percent of household heads were non-Hispanic blacks, 31 percent were Hispanic, and nearly all
31:959:93019:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:households were female-headed at baseline. About half of the experimental voucher group and 63 percent of
31:960:93124:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Section 8-only voucher group were able to obtain leases and move with an MTO voucher (the compliance
31:961:93228:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate).  The MTO families were tracked for 15 years using administrative data as well as major interim (4
31:962:93332:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to 7 years after random assignment) and long-term (10 to 15 years after random assignment) follow-up
31:963:93432:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:surveys and analyses (Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007; Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). MTO generated large and
31:964:93534:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:persistent improvements in residential neighborhoods for the treatment groups (especially the experimental
31:965:93640:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voucher group) relative to the control group but only modest changes in school quality.  The average MTO
31:966:93744:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:family lived at baseline in a neighborhood with a 53 percent poverty rate. MTO led to a 9 percentage point
31:967:93850:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decline in the duration-weighted average tract poverty rate over the 10-15 year follow-up period for the
31:968:93954:20:21:72:321:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experimental voucher group relative to the control group.
31:969:94011:21:20:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In stark contrast, MTO only modestly improved school quality for the MTO treatment groups.  From
31:970:94107:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the time of random assignment until the long-term follow-up, the experimental voucher group children at-
31:971:94211:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tended schools that outperformed their control group peers by only 3 percentile points on state exams, and
31:972:94317:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Section-8 only voucher group children attended schools that performed just 1 percentile point higher.
31:973:94422:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:MTO treatment group students also typically remained in schools where the majority of the students were
31:974:94525:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:low-income and minority.  MTO reduced the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch by
31:975:94628:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:4 percentage points for the experimental voucher group.  Although it is difficult to compare the size of the
31:976:94736:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:neighborhood quality change to that of the school quality change, MTO appears to have a larger improve-
31:977:94839:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment on neighborhood quality. The MTO treatment groups experienced more than twice as large a reduction
31:978:94942:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the share of poor residential peers as compared to poor school peers and more than three times as large an

32:980:95162:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the state test score distribution for their schools. Many of the MTO movers remained in the same school
32:981:95268:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:districts and very similar schools. MTO also had no significant impact on adult economic self-sufficiency or
32:982:95376:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:family income at the interim or long-run follow-ups. Thus, an analysis of the impacts of MTO treatments on
32:983:95482:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:child outcomes comes close to getting at the pure effects of changes in home and neighborhood conditions
32:984:95586:20:21:72:535:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for disadvantaged kids (with little change in schools or family economic resources):∂Y∂Hin our framework.

32:989:96107:20:20:71:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:being with larger gains for adults from sites where treatment induced larger reductions in neighborhood

32:991:96316:21:20:71:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:improvements in mental health (including substantial reductions in psychological distress) and marginally
32:992:96421:20:20:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significant improvements in physical health, but there were no long-term detectable health impacts for male

32:994:96631:21:20:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomization found that MTO produced no sustained improvements in academic achievement, educational

32:998:97046:20:20:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had large impacts on early-adulthood outcomes for children who were younger than 13 years old at random-
32:999:97150:20:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ization.  In their mid-twenties, these individuals have 31% higher incomes, have higher college attendance
32:1000:97256:20:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates, are less likely to be single parents, and live in better neighborhoods relative to similar individuals in
32:1001:97368:21:20:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the control group.  For children who were older than 13 years old at randomization, MTO had no positive
32:1002:97471:20:20:71:153:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long-term impacts.
32:1003:97489:20:21:88:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The MTO findings imply that large improvements in neighborhood conditions for poor families (at least

34:1044:101082:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:target primary students that were conducted during the 2007-2008 and 2010-2011 school year in Dallas and
34:1045:101186:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Houston, respectively.  In Dallas, Fryer (2011) paid second graders $2 per book to read and pass a short
34:1046:101290:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:computer-based comprehension quiz on the book in Accelerated Reader (AR), a software program that has
34:1047:101391:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:quizzes for 80,000 trade books, all major reading textbooks, and leading children’s magazines.  Students
34:1048:101495:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were allowed to select and read books of their choice at the appropriate reading level and at their leisure,
34:1049:101603:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not as a classroom assignment.  The books came from the existing stock available at their school (in the
34:1050:101707:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:library or in the classroom).  To reduce the possibility of cheating, quizzes were taken in the library on a
34:1051:101815:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:computer and students were only allowed one chance to take a quiz.  Data on the number of books read

34:1054:102131:21:20:72:181:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the 21 treatment schools.
34:1055:102156:20:20:88:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Paying students to read books yielded a treatment effect of 0.012σ(0.069) in reading and 0.079σ(0.086)
34:1056:102258:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in math.  The key result from this analysis emerges when one partitions students in Dallas into two groups
34:1057:102364:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based on whether they took the exam administered to students in bilingual classes (Logramos) or the exam
34:1058:102468:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:administered to students in regular classes (Iowa Test of Basic Skills). Splitting the data in this way reveals
34:1059:102579:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:that there is a 0.173σ(0.069) increase in reading achievement among English speaking students and a 0.118σ
34:1060:102685:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(0.104) decrease in reading achievement among students in bilingual classes. When we aggregate the results
34:1061:102791:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in our main analysis this heterogeneity cancels itself out.  Similarly, the treatment effect for students who
34:1062:102900:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are not English Language Learners is 0.221σ(0.068) and -0.164σ(0.095) for students who are English
34:1063:102998:20:21:72:159:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Language Learners.

35:1077:104360:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:total, the experiment distributed $51,358 to 46 teachers, $430,986 to 1,821 parents, and $393,038 to 1,734
35:1078:104466:21:20:72:250:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students across the 25 treatment schools.
35:1079:104507:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The experimental results raise a number of questions.  On outcomes for which direct incentives were
35:1080:104606:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provided, there were very large and statistically significant treatment effects. Students in treatment schools
35:1081:104716:21:20:72:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mastered 1.087σ(0.031) more math objectives than control students.  On average, treatment parents at-
35:1082:104817:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tended almost twice as many parent-teacher conferences as control group parents.  And, perhaps most im-
35:1083:104920:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:portant, these behaviors translated into a 0.081σ(0.025) increase in math achievement on Texas’s statewide
35:1084:105026:21:20:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student assessment.  The impact of our incentive scheme on reading achievement (which was not incen-
35:1085:105126:20:20:71:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tivized) is -0.077σ(0.027), however, offsetting the positive math effect.  These results are consistent with
35:1086:105234:20:21:71:424:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the classic multitasking and job design work of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991).
35:1087:105311:21:20:88:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Interestingly,  there is significant heterogeneity in treatment effects as a function of pretreatment test
35:1088:105417:20:20:71:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores.  Higher-achieving students (measured from pretreatment test scores) master 1.66σmore objectives,
35:1089:105521:20:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have parents who attend two more parent-teacher conferences, have 0.228σhigher standardized math test
35:1090:105622:20:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores and equal reading scores relative to high-achieving students in control schools.  Conversely, lower-
35:1091:105729:21:20:71:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achieving students master 0.686σmore objectives, have parents who attend 1.5 more parent-teacher con-
35:1092:105830:20:20:71:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ferences, have equal math test scores and 0.165σlowerreading scores.  Put differently, higher-achieving
35:1093:105933:20:21:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students put in significant effort and were rewarded for that effort in math without a deleterious impact in
35:1094:106041:21:20:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading.  Lower-achieving students also increased effort on the incentivized task, but did not increase their
35:1095:106150:20:20:71:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math scores and their reading scores decreased significantly. These data suggest that the classic “substitution
35:1096:106261:20:21:71:241:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect” may depend on baseline ability.
35:1097:106300:21:20:88:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Two years after removing the incentives, the treatment effect for high-achieving students is large and
35:1098:106402:20:20:71:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant in math [0.271σ(0.110)] and is small and statistically insignificant in reading.  In

36:1106:107146:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students. In Chicago, ninth graders were paid every five weeks for grades in their core courses. In Washing-

36:1108:107362:20:20:72:511:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attendance, behavior, and three inputs to the production function chosen by each school individually.
36:1109:107463:20:21:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results reported in Fryer (2011) and Fryer (2010) are surprising. The impact of financial incentives
36:1110:107567:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on state test scores is statistically zero in each city. In NYC, paying students for performance on standardized
36:1111:107679:20:20:72:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tests yielded treatment effects of 0.004σ(0.017) in reading and -0.031σ(0.037) in mathematics in seventh

36:1114:107991:20:20:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:various inputs to the educational production function, we observed an impact of 0.152σ(0.092) in reading
36:1115:108095:20:21:72:228:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 0.114σ(0.106) in mathematics.
36:1116:108128:21:20:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overall,  these estimates suggest that incentives are not a panacea – but we cannot rule out small to
36:1117:108229:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:modest effects (e.g., 0.10σ) which, given the relatively low cost of providing financial incentives to students,
36:1118:108341:20:21:72:232:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have a positive return on investment.
36:1119:108378:21:20:88:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Perhaps even more surprisingly, financial incentives had little or no effect on the outcomes for which

36:1121:108593:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives on the interim assessments is, if anything, negative. In Chicago, where we rewarded students for
36:1122:108700:20:21:72:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grades in five core subjects, the grade point average in these subjects increased 0.093σ(0.057) and treatment
36:1123:108809:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students earned 1.979 (1.169) more credits (half a class) than control students.  Both of these impacts are
36:1124:108916:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marginally significant. Incentives in Washington D.C. had no significant impacts on attendance rates, report

37:1142:110627:20:20:71:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:portance of education on future outcomes such as unemployment, incarceration, and wages and to provide
37:1143:110729:20:21:71:411:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives to read books through free cell phones and minutes to talk and text.
37:1144:110808:21:20:88:539:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Students in three treatment groups were given cellular phones free of charge, which came pre-loaded
37:1145:110907:20:20:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with 300 credits that could be used to make calls or send text messages.  Students in the main treatment
37:1146:111011:20:21:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:arm received 200 credits per month to use as they wanted and received one text message per day on the link
37:1147:111117:21:20:71:539:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between human capital and future outcomes delivered at approximately 6:00 P.M. A second treatment arm
37:1148:111218:20:20:71:539:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provided the same text messages as well as non-financial incentives – credits to talk and text were earned by
37:1149:111327:20:20:71:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading books outside of school.  A third treatment arm allowed students to earn credits by reading books
37:1150:111432:20:21:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and included no information. There was also a pure control group that received neither free cellular phones,
37:1151:111540:21:20:71:192:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information, nor incentives.
37:1152:111568:20:20:88:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:On direct outcomes for students in the informational treatments, Fryer (2013) reports students’ ability
37:1153:111671:20:21:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to answer specific questions about the information provided in the text messages.  Treatment effects were
37:1154:111776:21:20:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uniformly positive. Pooling across both informational treatments, treatment students were 4.9 (2.7) percent-
37:1155:111884:20:20:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:age points more likely to correctly identify the wage gap between college graduates and college dropouts,
37:1156:111989:20:21:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:17.9 (3.8) percentage points more likely to correctly identify the relationship between schooling and incar-
37:1157:112097:21:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ceration, and 17.8 (3.8) percentage points more likely to answer both questions correctly.  As a robustness
37:1158:112204:20:20:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:test, we included a “placebo” question on the unemployment rate of college graduates, about which students
37:1159:112310:20:21:71:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:never received information.  The difference in the probability of answering this question correctly between
37:1160:112417:21:20:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:informational treatments and the control group was trivial and statistically insignificant. Moreover, 54 per-
37:1161:112526:20:20:71:539:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cent of control students believe that incarceration rates for high school graduates and dropouts are “no[t]
37:1162:112633:20:21:71:539:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differen[t]” or “really close”, suggesting that students in Oklahoma Public Schools do not have accurate
37:1163:112737:21:0:71:239:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge of the returns to schooling.
38:1164:112777:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Results are mixed for indirect outcomes such as self-reported effort, state test scores, and attendance.
38:1165:112881:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Across the treatment arms, ITT estimates of the effect of treatment on self-reported effort are positive and
38:1166:112989:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant for both incentives and information arms.  For instance, students in the information
38:1167:113099:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment were 15.1 (3.7) percentage points more likely to report feeling more focused or excited about doing
38:1168:113208:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well in school and 7.0 (3.7) percentage points more likely to believe that students were working harder in
38:1169:113314:21:20:72:103:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school.
38:1170:113321:20:20:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In  stark  contrast,  on  all  administrative  outcomes  –  math  or  ELA  test  scores,  student  attendance,  or
38:1171:113435:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavioral incidence – there was no evidence that any treatment had a statistically significant impact, though
38:1172:113545:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to imprecise estimates one cannot rule out small to moderate effects which might have a positive return
38:1173:113652:20:20:72:136:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on investment.
38:1174:113666:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another potentially powerful incentive is offering students a chance to earn college credit or college
38:1175:113768:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:degrees while still in high school.  The idea is that offering college credit will increase student incentives
38:1176:113878:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to exert effort and increase access to college for some students.  Over 240 schools nationwide, called Early
38:1177:113986:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Colleges, have already adopted this model. Early Colleges combine a rigorous high school curriculum along
38:1178:114091:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the potential to earn two years of college credit or a two-year degree during high school.  Most Early
38:1179:114198:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Colleges target underserved students and team up with colleges to offer this opportunity at no or low cost
38:1180:114304:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the students. Berger et al. (2013) utilize the random lottery admission process of some Early Colleges to
38:1181:114412:21:20:72:379:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:investigate the causal impact of Early Colleges on students’ outcomes.
38:1182:114482:20:20:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In their study, Berger et al.  (2013) used administrative and survey data from ten Early Colleges that
38:1183:114584:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conducted random admission lotteries for the 2005-06, 2006-07, or 2007-08 school years. Comparing lottery
38:1184:114689:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:winners  to  lottery  losers,  they  were  able  to  estimate  causal  impacts  on  high  school  completion,  college
38:1185:114807:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment, college degrees earned, standardized test scores, and high school and college experiences. High
38:1186:114914:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school outcome and student demographic data were obtained directly from the administrative records of the
38:1187:115019:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools involved in the study; for college outcomes, students were matched to records in National Student
38:1188:115124:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Clearinghouse;  data on high school and college experiences as well as college credits obtained while in
38:1189:115228:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high school came from a student survey that the researchers administered to students in eight of the Early
38:1190:115334:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Colleges.  The final sample included 2,458 students for the administrative outcomes and 1,294 students for
38:1191:115440:21:20:72:164:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the survey outcomes.
38:1192:115460:20:20:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using  this  data,  Berger  et  al.   (2013)  found  that  students  offered  admission  to  Early  Colleges  were
38:1193:115574:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significantly more likely to graduate high school and ever attend college than students who lost the lottery.
38:1194:115683:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Eighty-six percent of Early College students graduated high school compared to 81 percent of lottery losers
38:1195:115790:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 80 percent of Early College students ever enrolled in college whereas only 71 percent of comparison
39:1196:115895:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students did. Note that these numbers only reflect enrollment observed during the study period, 2005-2011,
39:1197:116001:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and that the gap in enrollment rates between lottery winners and lottery losers was decreasing as time went
39:1198:116108:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on.  For example, for cohorts with six years of data available, the gap four years after 9th grade was 39.2
39:1199:116215:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percentage points and this gap had decreased to 9.8 percentage points six years out. Further, when restricting
39:1200:116325:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sample to only students that enrolled in college after high school graduation, lottery students were only
39:1201:116434:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:5.7 percentage points more likely to attend a four-year college and they find no significant differences for
39:1202:116542:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any college or two-year college enrollment. Similarly, during the study period, Early College students were
39:1203:116649:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:20 percentage points more likely to obtain a college degree (control mean was 2 percent).  These degrees
39:1204:116753:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were typically associate’s degrees and approximately 20 percent of Early College students earned a degree
39:1205:116858:20:20:72:200:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:before the end of high school
39:1206:116887:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Berger et al.  (2013) found no impact on GPA and math standardized test scores.  However, they found
39:1207:116987:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that Early College students scored 0.14 standard deviations higher than lottery losers on standardized ELA
39:1208:117093:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tests. The survey results showed that Early College students were 45.1 percentage points more likely to earn
39:1209:117201:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:college credit in high school than comparison students and that comparison students were 33.7 percentage
39:1210:117305:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:points more likely to take at least one advanced placement exam in high school. In addition, Early College
39:1211:117411:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students reported engaging in rigorous learning activities in school more frequently, being exposed to higher
39:1212:117520:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expectations of college attendance from teachers, principals, and their peers, and reported receiving more
39:1213:117626:21:20:72:353:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:help for completing college applications and financial aid forms.
39:1214:117691:20:20:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The findings overall suggest that Early Colleges can successfully impact students’ college enrollment
39:1215:117792:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  attainment  during  the  four  years  that  the  students  are  enrolled  in  an  Early  College  –  but  that  these
39:1216:117914:20:33:72:395:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts might not spillover to the years following high school graduation.

39:1220:118135:21:20:88:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Throughout  recorded  history,  the  children  of  the  elites  were  taught  in  a  manner  that  would  now  be
39:1221:118248:20:20:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:referred to as tutoring.  In ancient Greece, children from wealthy families received their primary education
39:1222:118356:20:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individually or in small groups from masters or tutors (Dunstan 2010). This practice continued for children
39:1223:118463:21:20:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  rich  and  nobles  throughout  the  Middle  Ages  (Nelson-Royes  2015).   As  late  as  the  17th  century,
39:1224:118579:20:20:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schooling was thought to be a social, not academic, activity with primary human capital produced in small
39:1225:118684:20:21:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups at home. Yet, the term, “tutoring”, has in more recent history become synonymous with remediation
39:1226:118788:21:0:72:171:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and fallen out of favor.
40:1227:118814:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There is substantial heterogeneity in how schools implement various programs that fall under the general
40:1228:118918:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:umbrella of “tutoring.” Some schools place students in one-on-one settings with a trained tutor, other schools
40:1229:119028:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:place  eight  students  with  a  volunteer.   Some  students  receive  tutoring  30  minutes  per  week,  others  are
40:1230:119145:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provided 5 hours of intense instruction in the same time period. This heterogeneity leads, naturally, to large
40:1231:119255:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differences in treatment effects.  Dobbie and Fryer (2013), define “high-dosage” tutoring as being tutored
40:1232:119361:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in groups of 6 or fewer for 4 or more days per week.  Moreover, they demonstrate that tutoring itself is
40:1233:119465:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not correlated with charter school effectiveness.  However, schools who implement “high-dosage” tutoring
40:1234:119569:20:21:72:239:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:demonstrate marked treatment effects.
40:1235:119606:21:20:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Following Dobbie and Fryer (2013), we divide the randomized field experiments in tutoring into these
40:1236:119706:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two groups:  low-dosage and high-dosage tutoring.  They are discussed in turn.  In this exposition, high-
40:1237:119811:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dosage tutoring is defined as being tutored in groups of 6 or fewer for more than three days per week or
40:1238:119915:21:29:72:447:487:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:being tutored at a rate that would equate to 50 hours or more over a 36-week period.22

40:1243:120345:20:20:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and adult outcomes that have been associated with poor early reading skills.   The study uses data from
40:1244:120448:20:20:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two  cohorts  of  students  drawn  from  eleven  schools  in  the  spring  of  1997  and  the  spring  of  1998.   The
40:1245:120566:20:21:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:researchers sent letters home to the parents of 723 students that teachers identified as being in the lowest
40:1246:120674:21:20:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:20% of readers in their classroom. Of these, 295 students were screened using standardized reading and IQ
40:1247:120779:20:20:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tests.  In order to be eligible for the study, students had to obtain a standard score below 90 on either the
40:1248:120888:20:21:72:540:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Word Identification or the Word Attack subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests, obtain a standard
40:1249:120991:21:20:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:score below 90 on a composite of these two subtests, and have a Verbal IQ of at least 80. After screening and
40:1250:121100:20:20:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:balancing for gender, 89 students were randomly assigned to treatment or control (48 to treatment and 41 to
40:1251:121207:20:21:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control).  The study also contained a neuroimaging component that required an additional health screening
40:1252:121312:21:20:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:post-randomization, thus, the researchers contacted parents again to gain consent for both the neuroimaging
40:1253:121419:20:20:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and tutoring aspects of the experiment.  This resulted in a final sample of 37 students in treatment and 32
40:1254:121526:20:21:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students in control. Balance tests revealed no significant differences on observables between the final set of

40:1256:121680:20:20:88:539:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Treatment students received one-on-one tutoring instruction for 50 minutes a day,  five days a week,
40:1257:121780:20:16:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from September to June. This resulted in the average treatment student attending 126 sessions or 105 hours

41:1259:121990:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of tutoring.  This instruction replaced the typical remedial instruction that the schools offered and that the
41:1260:122100:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control students participated in.  The instruction was carried out by 12 tutors who were certified in reading
41:1261:122209:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or special education.  Prior to the intervention, each tutor received 45 hours of training on early childhood
41:1262:122318:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interventions,  early reading acquisition,  and teaching strategies.  Additionally, tutors received 2 hours of
41:1263:122428:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:training each month for the duration of the experiment. The instruction focused on developing fluency and
41:1264:122533:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comprehension strategies, and teaching students to read for pleasure. To do this, tutors incorporated a five-
41:1265:122642:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:step plan that was featured in previous published studies into each session (Blachman 1987; Blachman et al.
41:1266:122749:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1999).  In over 90% of classroom observations and audiotapes of the tutor sessions, tutors included all five
41:1267:122857:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:steps of the instruction.  Control students continued business-as-usual – nine control students received no
41:1268:122964:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:remedial instruction outside of their reading class and the rest participated in small group tutoring that met
41:1269:123074:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for 3-5 times a week. On average, control students that received remedial instruction attended 104 sessions
41:1270:123181:21:20:72:278:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and received 77 hours of additional instruction.
41:1271:123229:20:20:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To test the impact of treatment, Blachman et al.  (2004) administered a battery of tests pretreatment,
41:1272:123331:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:immediately following treatment,  and one year after treatment.  The test battery included the Woodcock

41:1278:123942:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:significant impacts on all standardized reading measures.  These impacts ranged from 0.55σon the com-
41:1279:124043:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prehension subtest of the GORT to 1.69σon the WRMT basic skills cluster.   Furthermore,  6 of these 8
41:1280:124144:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts were still large and significant a year after the completion of the experiment (the two insignificant
41:1281:124253:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts were 0.30σand 0.24σon the GORT accuracy and GORT comprehension subtests, respectively).
41:1282:124348:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The authors saw similar reading results for the non-standardized subtests from the CTOPP. As expected,
41:1283:124450:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment had no significant impacts on standardized measures of mathematics. If anything, at posttest, the
41:1284:124557:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math results suggest negative impacts with effect sizes of -0.33σand -0.37σon the WJ-R calculations and
41:1285:124660:20:21:72:244:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applied problems subtests, respectively.
41:1286:124700:21:20:88:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The findings overall suggest that one-on-one high dosage tutoring with research-proven instruction can
41:1287:124802:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase the growth rates of low-ability students. Although treatment and control students have statistically
41:1288:124911:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indistinguishable growth rates in the follow-up year, the large impact on reading scores from one year of

41:1290:125034:20:0:88:539:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another randomized study that investigates the impacts of high-dosage tutoring on low-ability students
42:1291:125138:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is Cook et al. (2014). In this study, we implemented an academic and behavioral intervention for 106 male
42:1292:125243:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:9th and 10th grade students from a public school in the south side of Chicago. Over 90% of the sample were
42:1293:125349:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:both black and eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The intervention consisted of providing students with
42:1294:125459:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-academic supports that teach the students social cognitive skills through the “Becoming a Man” (BAM)
42:1295:125563:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program while also providing students intensive individualized tutoring. The BAM program used principles
42:1296:125667:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  to  deliver  a  curriculum  that  focused  on  values  education.   The  program
42:1297:125783:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sought to develop specific social or social cognitive skills such as generating new solutions to problems,
42:1298:125889:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:learning new ways to behave, and identifying consequences ahead of time.  BAM was conducted in small
42:1299:125989:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups that met once a week for one hour each time. Over the course of the year, students had the chance to
42:1300:126096:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:participate in 27 different group sessions and typically had to skip an academic class in order to participate.
42:1301:126207:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For the academic portion of the intervention, students met in groups of two with a math tutor one hour a
42:1302:126311:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:day, every day.  The tutors were hired following the methodology of Match Corps and were paid $16,000
42:1303:126412:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plus benefits for the nine-month academic year.23Control students were not eligible to participate in BAM
42:1304:126517:20:21:72:513:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or the intensive tutoring but could participate in other academic supports available at the high school.
42:1305:126621:21:20:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Students were selected to participate in the study based on an academic risk index that was a function of
42:1306:126726:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the number of prior-year course failures, unexcused absences, and being previously held back. The 106 male
42:1307:126832:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:9th and 10th grade students with the highest risk index score were then randomly assigned to three groups:
42:1308:126938:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Control (N=34), BAM only (N=24), and BAM plus high-dosage tutoring (N=48). In order to investigate the
42:1309:127040:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impact of assignment to one of these two treatment arms, we obtained student-level records from Chicago
42:1310:127143:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Public Schools that contained demographic information and scores from the EXPLORE and PLAN tests for
42:1311:127243:20:21:72:268:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the year prior to and year of the intervention.
42:1312:127290:21:20:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We found that the ITT effect of assigning students to either one of the treatment arms was large and
42:1313:127390:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant for math achievement and math GPA. Assignment to either treatment arm increased
42:1314:127495:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math achievement by 0.51σand increased math GPA by 0.425 grade points on a four-point scale. We found
42:1315:127596:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no spillovers to reading achievement and no significant impacts on discipline incidents or number of days
42:1316:127701:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suspended. However, treatment students were absent 10.272 fewer days throughout the school year. Mostly
42:1317:127804:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to the relatively modest size of our sample, when separated by treatment arm, we found no significant
42:1318:127909:21:41:72:290:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:difference between the impacts of the two groups.
42:1319:127958:41:14:84:539:121:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:23Match Corps is an AmeriCorps program in which members spend a year attempting to close the achievement gap by tutoring
42:1320:128078:14:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:small groups of students in the various Match Charter Schools in Boston. Match Corps seeks to employ tutors who are dedicated to
42:1321:128206:11:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:constant improvement, who possess strong communication and writing skills, and who are committed to spending a year working
42:1322:128329:11:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:with children.  Adopting their hiring best practices, tutors in Chicago were required to pass a math assessment, conduct a mock
42:1323:128456:11:0:72:448:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:tutorial session with actual high school students, and interview with the principal or principal’s designee.
43:1324:128566:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Summarizing, the meta-coefficient on high-dosage tutoring is 0.309σ(0.106) for math achievement and
43:1325:128665:20:21:71:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.229σ(0.033) for reading achievement.  Indeed, 54.3% of coefficients demonstrate statistically significant
43:1326:128772:21:20:71:539:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive treatment effects;  0% yield statistically significant negative effects.  Surprisingly, the fraction of
43:1327:128884:20:32:71:398:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically positive treatments is larger than early childhood interventions.

43:1329:128982:21:20:88:539:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Early Start to Emancipation Preparation (ESTEP)-Tutoring program of Los Angeles County was
43:1330:129076:20:20:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:created in 1998.  The program targets foster children aged 14 to 15 who are three or more years behind in
43:1331:129181:20:21:71:539:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math or reading ability. ESTEP-Tutoring aims to improve the math and reading skills of these students and
43:1332:129286:21:20:71:539:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:encourage them to take advantage of educational resources of which they may have been previously unaware.
43:1333:129391:20:20:71:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Tutoring is provided in the home of the students by college student tutors drawn from the surrounding twelve
43:1334:129499:20:21:71:539:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:community colleges. Tutors are trained to teach the students in math, reading, and spelling and are provided
43:1335:129607:21:20:71:539:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with curriculum materials that fit a student’s skill level. In addition to tutoring, the program hopes to foster
43:1336:129719:20:20:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a mentorship relationship between the tutor and the student. Once assigned to the program, each student is
43:1337:129825:20:21:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:eligible for 50 hours of tutoring and tutors are allotted additional time for preparation, mentoring, or other
43:1338:129935:21:20:71:539:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:activities.  Courtney et al.  (2008) take advantage of the high demand of ESTEP-Tutoring and conduct an
43:1339:130038:20:20:71:367:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluation of the program using its oversubscribed application pool.
43:1340:130106:20:20:88:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For the study, all students referred to the program were screened to ensure their math or reading ability

43:1342:130316:21:20:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could participate in ESTEP-Tutoring or a control group that could not.  This resulted in a study sample of
43:1343:130422:20:20:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:445 students, 246 assigned to treatment and 219 assigned to control. On average, approximately four months
43:1344:130528:20:21:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:passed between assignment and a student’s first meeting with a tutor. Throughout the two years of the study
43:1345:130635:21:20:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:researchers found that 61.8 percent of treatment students eventually participated in ESTEP-Tutoring and
43:1346:130738:20:20:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the average treatment student received 18 hours of math tutoring and 17 hours of reading tutoring.  The
43:1347:130841:20:21:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relatively low take-up rate is attributed to the high mobility of foster children and the length of time that
43:1348:130950:21:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:passed between assignment and receipt of tutoring. By the time tutors attempted to deliver the first tutoring

43:1350:131166:20:21:71:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Once the tutoring program was initiated, students were eligible for 50 hours of tutoring delivered through 2

44:1362:132280:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to report having been tutored at home.  However, control students were more likely to report that they had
44:1363:132386:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:received tutoring at school and the total number of tutoring hours reported by treatment and control students
44:1364:132495:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were not statistically different.  The authors limit their impact analysis to the second follow-up interview
44:1365:132603:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(two years after random assignment) due to the fact that participation in ESTEP was still ongoing for many

44:1375:133549:21:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by about one-third (Krueger, 1999). Using quasi-experimental methods, Chetty et al. (2011) estimate that a

44:1380:134018:20:21:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:research.  Observable characteristics such as college-entrance test scores,  grade point averages,  or major

44:1383:134337:20:21:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers more effective have shown little impact on teacher quality (see e.g., Boyd et al. 2007 for a review).

45:1386:134657:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the fact that teacher quality and aptitude has declined significantly in the past 40 years (Corcoran et al.

45:1392:135041:20:21:88:539:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Perhaps the most obvious way to increase teacher supply is to lower the barriers into the teaching pro-

45:1394:135252:20:20:71:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shortages and the No Child Left Behind Act, which required every classroom to be staffed with a certified
45:1395:135357:20:21:71:539:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher or a teacher actively pursuing a certification through an approved program, there has been an in-

45:1397:135571:20:20:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their certification requirements at an accredited university or program before starting to teach in a classroom.
45:1398:135683:20:21:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In comparison, alternatively certified (AC) teachers start teaching before completing their requirements and
45:1399:135791:21:20:71:539:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:earn their certification while teaching.  Well-known examples of AC programs include Teach for America
45:1400:135893:20:20:71:539:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(TFA) and the New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) program.  Both of these programs attract ex-
45:1401:135990:20:20:71:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tremely qualified uncertified individuals and place them in schools that are in dire need of good teachers.
45:1402:136097:20:21:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The potential benefits and advantages of these different routes to certification have been debated by many.
45:1403:136204:21:20:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For example, some argue that the coursework required for traditionally certified (TC) teachers is an unnec-
45:1404:136311:20:20:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:essary burden that discourages some from pursuing teaching and AC programs are a way to circumvent that.
45:1405:136415:20:21:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In contrast, others argue that without that coursework, AC teachers enter classrooms underprepared and will
45:1406:136522:21:20:71:143:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be less effective.
45:1407:136540:20:20:88:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In order to better understand the effectiveness of AC teachers relative to TC teachers, Constantine et
45:1408:136642:20:21:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:al.  (2009) conducted a randomized study in elementary schools around the nation in the 2004-2005 and
45:1409:136743:21:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2005-2006 school years.  Their study included 63 schools from 20 districts in 7 states across the nation.
45:1410:136848:20:20:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Within these schools, 2,610 K-5 students were randomly assigned to be taught by an AC teacher or a TC
45:1411:136949:20:21:71:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher for one school year.  Schools were only allowed to participate if they had at least one eligible AC
45:1412:137056:21:20:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher and one eligible TC teacher in the same grade.  In order for a teacher to be eligible to participate,
45:1413:137165:20:20:71:539:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers had to be relative novices, had to teach in a regular classroom, and had to deliver both reading and
45:1414:137274:20:21:71:539:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math instruction to all their students.  Researchers collected data on student achievement by administering

46:1416:137497:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also collected data on the classroom practices of teachers through classroom observations and principals’
46:1417:137602:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ratings.  In addition, all teachers completed a survey in the spring that collected information on teachers’
46:1418:137710:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:professional and personal backgrounds, experience in the school as a full-time teacher, and SAT/ACT scores.
46:1419:137817:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, they also collected data on the details of each program a teacher attended for certification/alternative
46:1420:137930:20:21:72:120:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:placement.
46:1421:137940:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Constantine et al. (2009) found that students of AC teachers did not perform statistically different than
46:1422:138045:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students of TC teachers. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences when comparing low
46:1423:138153:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grade-level (K-1) teachers to high grade-level (2-5) teachers or low-experience teachers to high-experience
46:1424:138260:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers.  When exploring heterogeneous effect sizes across amount of coursework teachers were required
46:1425:138363:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to do while teaching, there is some evidence that AC teachers who had high-levels of course work had neg-
46:1426:138468:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ative impacts on student achievement. Similarly, there is no statistically significant difference in classroom
46:1427:138578:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observation scores between AC and TC teachers.  However,  when restricting the sample to teachers that
46:1428:138680:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had high-levels of coursework, there is evidence that AC teachers’ classroom practices were worse than TC
46:1429:138785:20:21:72:156:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers’ practices.
46:1430:138805:21:20:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the experimental results, Constantine et al.  (2009) also present non-experimental results
46:1431:138910:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that explore the relationship between teacher characteristics and program details with the impacts on stu-
46:1432:139016:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dents’ achievement. Overall, they found that teacher characteristics and training experiences only explained
46:1433:139124:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:5 percent of the variation in effects on math test scores and 1 percent of the variation in effects on reading test
46:1434:139239:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scores.  The only significant correlations they found were that AC teachers with master’s degrees were less
46:1435:139346:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effective in improving student achievement in reading than TC teachers without a master’s degree and that
46:1436:139451:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students in classrooms taught by AC teachers who were taking coursework towards a degree or certification
46:1437:139556:21:20:72:463:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did worse in reading than students taught by TC teachers who weren’t taking coursework.
46:1438:139643:20:20:88:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Some argue that schools don’t just need access to more teachers, but specifically need access to different
46:1439:139749:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and potentially better talent pools.  Proponents of this argument often point to successful foreign education
46:1440:139858:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:systems, such as Hong Kong or Finland, that draw their teachers from the uppermost ranks of their univer-

46:1442:140072:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:been declining since 1960 (see Corcoran et al. 2004). Hoxby and Leigh (2004) attribute a large part of this

46:1444:140282:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:past couple decades, we have seen an increase of programs designed to combat this decline and get more
46:1445:140384:20:21:72:467:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and better college students to enter into teaching. One such program is Teach for America.
46:1446:140474:21:20:88:539:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Teach For America, a non-profit organization that recruits recent college graduates to teach for two years
46:1447:140580:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in low-income communities, is one of the nation’s most prominent service programs.  Based on founder
47:1448:140682:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Wendy Kopp’s undergraduate thesis at Princeton University, TFA’s mission is to create a movement that will
47:1449:140788:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:eliminate educational inequity by enlisting our nation’s most promising future leaders as teachers. In 1990,
47:1450:140896:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TFA’s first year in operation, Kopp raised $2.5 million and attracted 2,500 applicants for 500 teaching slots
47:1451:141005:20:20:72:369:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in New York, North Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, and Los Angeles.
47:1452:141070:20:21:88:539:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Since its founding, TFA corps members have taught more than three million students.  Today, there are
47:1453:141171:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:8,200 TFA corps members in 125 “high-need” districts across the country, including 13 of the 20 districts
47:1454:141276:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the lowest graduation rates.  Roughly 80 percent of the students reached by TFA qualify for free or
47:1455:141380:20:21:72:371:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reduced-price lunch and more than 90 percent are black or Hispanic.
47:1456:141447:21:20:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Entry into TFA is highly competitive; in 2010, more than 46,000 individuals applied for just over 4,000
47:1457:141550:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spots. Twelve percent of all Ivy League seniors applied. In its recruitment efforts, TFA focuses on individu-
47:1458:141659:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:als who possess strong academic records and leadership capabilities, regardless of whether or not they have
47:1459:141766:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had prior exposure to teaching. To apply, candidates complete an online application, which includes a letter
47:1460:141874:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of intent and a resume.  After a phone interview, the most promising applicants are invited to participate in
47:1461:141983:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an in-person interview, which includes a sample teaching lesson, a group discussion, a written exercise, and
47:1462:142091:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a personal interview. Applicants who are invited to interview are also required to provide transcripts, obtain
47:1463:142201:20:20:72:367:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two online recommendations, and provide one additional reference.
47:1464:142266:20:21:88:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using information collected through the application and interview, TFA bases their candidate selection
47:1465:142368:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on a model that accounts for multiple criteria that they believe are linked to success in the classroom. These
47:1466:142478:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:criteria include achievement, perseverance, critical thinking, organizational ability, motivational ability, re-
47:1467:142590:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spect for others, and commitment to the TFA mission.  TFA conducts ongoing research on their selection
47:1468:142692:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:criteria, focusing on the link between these criteria and observed single-year gains in student achievement
47:1469:142799:21:20:72:157:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in TFA classrooms.
47:1470:142817:20:20:88:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:TFA teachers are required to take part in a five-week TFA summer institute to prepare them for place-
47:1471:142918:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment  in  the  classroom  at  the  end  of  the  summer.   The  TFA  summer  institute  includes  courses  covering
47:1472:143033:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teaching practice, classroom management, diversity, learning theory, literacy development, and leadership.
47:1473:143139:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:During the institute, groups of participants also take full teaching responsibility for a class of summer school
47:1474:143251:20:21:72:110:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students.
47:1475:143260:21:20:88:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:At the time of their interview,  applicants submit their subject, grade,  and location preferences.  TFA
47:1476:143364:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:works to balance these preferences with the needs and requirements of districts.  With respect to location,
47:1477:143471:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applicants rank each TFA region as highly preferred, preferred, or less preferred and indicate any special
47:1478:143577:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:considerations, such as the need to coordinate with a spouse. Over 90 percent of the TFA applicants accepted
47:1479:143685:20:0:72:417:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are matched to one of their “highly preferred” regions (Glazerman et al. 2006).
48:1480:143766:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:TFA also attempts to match applicants to their preferred grade levels and subjects, depending on appli-
48:1481:143869:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cants’ academic backgrounds, district needs, and state and district certification requirements.  As require-
48:1482:143977:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ments vary by region,  applicants may not be qualified to teach the same subjects and grade levels in all
48:1483:144082:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:areas.  It is also difficult for school regions to predict the exact openings they will have in the fall, and late
48:1484:144196:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:changes in subject or grade-level assignments are not uncommon.  Predicted effectiveness scores are not
48:1485:144299:21:20:72:512:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used to determine the placement region, grade, or school, and the scores are not available to districts.
48:1486:144403:20:20:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:TFA corps members are hired to teach in local school districts through alternative routes to certification.
48:1487:144510:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Typically, they must take and pass exams required by their districts before they begin teaching and may also
48:1488:144618:21:20:72:410:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be required to take additional courses to meet state certification requirements.
48:1489:144698:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:TFA corps members are employed and paid directly by the school districts for which they work, and
48:1490:144795:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generally receive the same salaries and health benefits as other first year teachers.   Most districts pay a
48:1491:144903:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:$1,500 per corps member fee to TFA to offset screening and recruiting costs.  TFA gives corps members
48:1492:145004:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:various additional financial benefits, including “education awards” of $4,725 for each year of service that
48:1493:145111:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be used for past or future educational expenses, and transitional grants and no-interest loans to help
48:1494:145217:21:20:72:274:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corps members make it to their first paycheck.
48:1495:145263:20:20:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To date, there have been a couple randomized evaluations of the impact of TFA teachers. Glazerman et
48:1496:145363:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:al.  (2006) report findings from a national evaluation of TFA. The experiment involved approximately 100
48:1497:145467:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:elementary classrooms from 17 schools drawn from Baltimore, Chicago, Compton, Houston, New Orleans,
48:1498:145566:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the Mississippi Delta.  Students were stratified by grade and school and assigned randomly to either a
48:1499:145672:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TFA or a non-TFA teacher. At the end of school year, Glazerman et al. (2006) found that students assigned to
48:1500:145780:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TFA teachers score about 0.12σhigher in math and 0.03σhigher in reading than students assigned to tradi-
48:1501:145884:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tionally certified teachers.They found no impacts on other student outcomes such as attendance, promotion,
48:1502:145990:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or disciplinary incidents, but TFA teachers were more likely to report problems with student behavior than
48:1503:146096:20:21:72:144:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were their peers.
48:1504:146113:21:20:88:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An even bigger study analyzed by Clark et al.  (2013) uses a sample drawn from almost 100 schools
48:1505:146210:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across eight states to investigate the effectiveness of middle school math teachers from TFA and a similar
48:1506:146316:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program called The New Teacher Project (TNTP). In each participating school,  students were randomly
48:1507:146416:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assigned to math classrooms taught by a program teacher (TFA or TNTP) or a teacher that did not enter
48:1508:146517:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher through either of these programs.  Similar to Glazerman et al.  (2006), Clark et al.  (2013) find a
48:1509:146624:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:significant impact of TFA on students’ math test scores.  Students assigned to TFA teachers scored 0.07σ
48:1510:146728:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher on state standardized testing whereas students assigned to TNTP teachers had test scores that were
48:1511:146833:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indistinguishable from students in control classrooms.  Note that this study was not designed to investigate
49:1512:146943:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the difference between TFA and TNTP teachers.  Students were not randomly assigned between TFA and
49:1513:147041:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TNTP teachers, so differences between the effectiveness of the teachers could be due to differences in the
49:1514:147147:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students they taught, the comparison teachers, or the schools they were in. Indeed, TFA and TNTP teachers
49:1515:147252:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:included in the study largely taught in different schools and districts. With this in mind, there are still some
49:1516:147364:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:major differences between the two programs worth noting. TFA requires its teachers to commit to two years
49:1517:147469:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of teacher whereas TNTP expects their recruits to teach for many years.  Also, TFA recruits heavily from
49:1518:147573:20:20:72:423:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:college campuses while TNTP recruits professionals that want to switch careers.
49:1519:147652:20:21:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Several other programs similar – in spirit – to TFA are Boston Teaching Residency, Match Teaching
49:1520:147749:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Residency, NYC Teaching Fellowships, Inner-City Teaching Corps of Chicago, and Harvard Teaching Fel-
49:1521:147849:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lows.  Although these programs all differ in length, training procedures, and credentials earned through the
49:1522:147957:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program, they all recruit college graduates with strong academic backgrounds and place them in struggling
49:1523:148062:21:32:72:520:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school districts. To the best of our knowledge, no randomized evaluations exist yet for these programs.

49:1525:148185:20:21:88:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To increase teacher productivity, there is growing enthusiasm among policy makers for initiatives that tie
49:1526:148291:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher incentives to the achievement of their students.  Since 2006, the U.S. Department of Education has
49:1527:148397:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provided over $1 billion to incentive programs through the Teacher Incentive Fund – a program designed
49:1528:148499:20:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specifically to support efforts developing and implementing performance-based compensation systems in
49:1529:148600:20:21:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools. At least seven states and many more school districts have implemented teacher incentive programs
49:1530:148705:21:20:72:322:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in an effort to increase student achievement (Fryer 2013).
49:1531:148763:20:20:88:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Yet, the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of teacher incentive programs is mixed.  In developing
49:1532:148866:20:21:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:countries where the degree of teacher professionalism is extremely low and absenteeism is rampant, field
49:1533:148970:21:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments that link pay to teacher performance are associated with substantial improvements in student
49:1534:149074:20:20:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:test scores (Duflo et al. 2012; Glewwe et al. 2010; Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011). Conversely, the
49:1535:149178:20:21:72:444:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:few field experiments conducted in the United States have had, at best, mixed results.
49:1536:149264:21:20:88:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Theoretically, it is unclear how to design optimal teacher incentives when the objective is to improve
49:1537:149366:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student achievement.   Much depends on the characteristics of the education production function.   If,  for
49:1538:149473:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instance,  the production function is additively separable,  then individual incentives may dominate group
49:1539:149579:21:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives, as the latter encourages free-riding.  If, however, the production function has important com-
49:1540:149685:20:20:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plementarities between teachers in the production of student achievement, group incentives may be more
49:1541:149787:20:33:72:288:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effective at increasing achievement (Baker 2002).

50:1545:150054:21:20:72:539:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:need schools, distributing a total of roughly $75 million to over 20,000 teachers.24The experiment was
50:1546:150156:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a randomized school-based trial.  Each participating school could earn $3,000 for every UFT-represented
50:1547:150259:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:staff member if the school met the annual performance target set by the DOE based on school report cards,
50:1548:150364:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which the school could distribute at its own discretion. Each participating school was given $1,500 per UFT
50:1549:150471:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:staff member if it met at least 75% of the target but not the full target.  Note that the average New York
50:1550:150577:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:City public school has roughly sixty teachers; this implies a transfer of $180,000 to schools on average if
50:1551:150684:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they met their annual targets and a transfer of $90,000 if they met at least 75% of, but not the full target.
50:1552:150793:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In elementary and middle schools, school report card scores hinge on student performance and progress on
50:1553:150897:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:state assessments, student attendance, and learning environment survey results. High schools are evaluated
50:1554:151003:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:similarly,  with graduation rates,  Regents exams,  and credits earned replacing state assessment results as
50:1555:151111:20:20:72:238:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:proxies for performance and progress.
50:1556:151148:20:21:88:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An important feature of the experiment is that schools had discretion over their incentive plans.   As
50:1557:151250:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mentioned above, if a participating school met all of the annual targets, it received a lump sum equivalent
50:1558:151357:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to $3,000 per full-time unionized teacher.  Each school had the power to decide whether all of the rewards
50:1559:151463:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:would  be  given  to  a  small  subset  of  teachers  with  the  highest  value-added,  whether  the  winners  of  the
50:1560:151581:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rewards would be decided by lottery, or virtually anything in-between. The only restriction was that schools
50:1561:151689:20:20:72:323:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were not allowed to distribute rewards based on seniority.
50:1562:151747:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An overwhelming majority of the schools decided on a group incentive scheme that varied the individ-

50:1564:151950:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge of education production and believe the production function to have important complementar-
50:1565:152051:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ities, because they feared retribution from other teachers if they supported individual rewards, or simply
50:1566:152157:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because this was as close to pay based on seniority (the UFT’s official view as to why schools typically
50:1567:152261:21:20:72:248:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:settled on this scheme) as they could do.
50:1568:152302:20:20:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results from this incentive experiment are informative. Providing incentives to teachers based on a
50:1569:152405:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school’s performance on metrics involving student achievement, improvement, and the learning environment
50:1570:152509:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did not increase student achievement in any statistically meaningful way.  If anything, student achievement
50:1571:152616:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:declined.  ITT estimates yield treatment effects of -0.018σ(0.024) in mathematics and -0.014σ(0.020) in
50:1572:152719:20:23:71:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading for elementary schools,  and -0.046σ(0.018) in math and -0.030σ(0.011) in reading for middle

50:1574:152943:14:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:time of the negotiation, I was serving as an advisor to Chancellor Klein and convinced both parties to agree to include random

51:1578:153330:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading,  neither  of  which  is  statistically  significant.   For  middle  school  students,  however,  the  negative
51:1579:153449:20:20:72:474:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts are more sizeable: -0.138σin math and -0.090σin reading over a three-year period.
51:1580:153538:20:21:88:539:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Consistent with Fryer (2013), Springer et al.  (2012) evaluated another group incentive experiment that
51:1581:153641:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:took place in the Round Rock Independent School District in Texas.  The study used random assignment
51:1582:153741:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to investigate the impacts of a program that awarded teams of middle school teachers bonuses based on
51:1583:153842:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their collective contribution to students’ test score gains. Two years after the initial randomization, Springer

51:1591:154515:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:group could earn up to $15,000 as a bonus if their students made gains in state mathematics test scores
51:1592:154618:20:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equivalent to the 95th percentile in the district.  They were awarded $5,000 and $10,000 if their students
51:1593:154724:20:21:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:made gains equivalent to the 80th and the 90th percentiles, respectively.  Springer et al.  (2010) found there
51:1594:154834:21:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was no significant treatment effect on student achievement and on measures of teachers’ response such as
51:1595:154938:20:20:72:153:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teaching practices.
51:1596:154957:20:21:88:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In an important observation, Neal (2011) discusses how group incentives (e.g.  Fryer 2013;  Springer
51:1597:155057:21:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al.  2012) or sufficiently obtuse (e.g.  Springer et al.  2010) pay schemes lead to problems when trying
51:1598:155164:20:20:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to calculate the incentive effect at the individual teacher level and could be the reason these experiments
51:1599:155271:20:21:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observed little to no incentive effects. For instance, calculating the expected value of a one standard deviation
51:1600:155384:21:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase in teacher effort when the incentive scheme depends on where a teacher lies in the overall district
51:1601:155492:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution is a non-trivial calculation for an econometrician with loads of data and sophisticated techniques.
51:1602:155604:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:It would be exceedingly difficult for a teacher to perform this calculation and understand how their efforts
51:1603:155712:21:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could translate into rewards. To circumvent this and competition issues between teachers, Barlevy and Neal
51:1604:155818:20:20:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2012) develop a “pay for percentile” method that rewards teachers according to how highly their students’

52:1607:156060:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although not fully using the method recommended by Barlevy and Neal (2012), Glazerman et al. (2009)

52:1609:156263:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sures. This incentive scheme is more in line with the insights in Neal (2011) than Fryer (2013) or Springer
52:1610:156370:20:20:72:152:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al (2010, 2012).
52:1611:156389:20:21:88:539:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In 2007, Chicago Public Schools implemented its own version of the national Teacher Advancement
52:1612:156484:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Program (TAP). The national version of TAP was developed in the late 1990s by the Milken Family Foun-

52:1614:156692:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to Mentor or Lead Teacher and receive annual performance bonuses based on their value-added and class-
52:1615:156794:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:room observations.  Chicago adopted this model with some minor alterations.  For example, the Chicago
52:1616:156895:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TAP added principal bonuses tied to implementation benchmarks and school-wide value-added.  Teacher
52:1617:156994:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:incentives had an expected payout of $2,000 per teacher and teachers could earn an additional $7,000 by
52:1618:157097:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:becoming a Mentor or an additional $15,000 by becoming a Lead Teacher.   As Mentors,  teachers were
52:1619:157196:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expected to provide ongoing classroom support to other teachers in the school.  Lead Teachers served on

52:1630:158309:20:21:72:481:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and principals to collect important information that was not present in the administrative data.
52:1631:158405:21:20:88:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The evaluation suggests that TAP increased retention in treatment schools.  Teachers in TAP schools
52:1632:158504:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had a retention rate of 87.9 percent while teachers in control schools had a retention rate of 82.8 percent, a
52:1633:158614:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically significant difference. However, teacher satisfaction and teachers’ positive attitudes toward their
52:1634:158727:21:20:72:400:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:principals were not statistically different between TAP and control schools.
52:1635:158803:20:20:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:More importantly, the introduction of TAP did not produce any measurable impacts on student stan-

53:1644:159601:21:20:72:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:ditional” financial incentives in the form of bonuses at the end of the year linked to student achievement.25
53:1645:159710:20:20:71:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Other teachers – the “Loss” treatment – were given a lump sum payment at the beginning of the school year
53:1646:159815:20:21:71:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and informed that they would have to return some or all of it if their students did not meet performance tar-
53:1647:159924:21:20:71:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gets.  Teachers in the “Gain” and “Loss” groups with the same performance received the same final bonus.
53:1648:160028:20:20:71:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Within the “Loss” and “Gain” groups, we additionally tested whether there are heterogeneous effects for
53:1649:160131:20:21:71:425:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individual teacher rewards compared to awarding incentives to teams of teachers.
53:1650:160211:21:20:88:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In all groups, performance was incentivized according to the “pay for percentile” method developed by
53:1651:160312:20:20:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Barlevy and Neal (2011), in which teachers are rewarded according to how highly their students’ test score
53:1652:160418:20:21:71:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:improvement ranks among peers from other schools with similar baseline achievement and demographic
53:1653:160516:21:20:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics.  As Neal (2011) describes, pay for percentile schemes separate incentives and performance
53:1654:160622:20:20:71:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measurements for teachers since this method only uses information on relative ranks of the students. Thus,

53:1657:160879:20:20:88:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The first year ITT results of our experiment are consistent with over three decades of psychological and

53:1659:161086:20:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be consistent with the data.  Students who were assigned to teachers in the “Loss” treatment show large
53:1660:161189:21:20:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and statistically significant gains in year one math test scores (0.455σ(0.097)).  Teacher incentives that are
53:1661:161299:20:20:71:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:framed as gains demonstrate less success. In the first year of the experiment, students in the “Gain” treatment
53:1662:161410:20:21:71:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased their math test scores 0.245σ(0.094). Importantly, the difference between the “Loss” and “Gain”
53:1663:161515:21:20:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatments in math improvement is statistically significant at conventional levels.   More generally,  these
53:1664:161623:20:20:71:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results support the view in Barlevy and Neal (2011) and Neal (2011) that properly designed incentives can
53:1665:161728:20:21:71:174:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have significant effects.
53:1666:161753:21:20:88:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Interestingly,  when looking at the sample of all students,  we find little evidence of treatment effects

53:1668:161959:20:23:71:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:are 0.115σ(0.109).  The pooled estimates for both years of the experiment are 0.210σ(0.069) and 0.116σ

54:1674:162504:21:20:88:539:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although incentivizing teachers had differential impacts across both years when looking at the entire
54:1675:162605:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample, we found that kindergartners had large gains in both years of the experiment regardless of whether
54:1676:162711:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their teachers were in the “Loss” or “Gain” group. In the first year of the experiment, the ITT estimates for
54:1677:162820:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:kindergarten students were 0.796σ(0.209) for “Loss” and 0.376σ(0.168) for “Gain”.  In the second year,
54:1678:162922:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the estimates were 0.574σ(0.176) and 0.714σ(0.144) for “Loss” and “Gain” respectively.  Therefore, the
54:1679:163024:20:33:72:518:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pooled effect size for both years and both treatments was 0.568σ(0.121) for kindergarten math scores.

54:1681:163141:20:20:88:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In America, inexperienced teachers are more likely to be assigned to high-minority and high-poverty
54:1682:163240:20:21:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classrooms  (Feng 2010).   As  a result,  novice teachers are  taking on tougher school assignments,  teach-
54:1683:163348:21:20:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing multiple grades, and teaching out-of-field classes (Donaldson and Johnson 2010).  To counteract this
54:1684:163452:20:20:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trend, several school districts – such as Houston ISD – provide effective teachers incentives to teach in the
54:1685:163561:20:21:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:most troubled schools.  The theory is that the marginal return for an additional effective teacher in a well-
54:1686:163670:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:functioning school is less than the marginal return of that teacher in a less well-functioning school.  Good
54:1687:163778:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers have the potential to change the culture of a school and provide effective pedagogical tools and
54:1688:163883:20:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mentorship to struggling colleagues.  If true, providing incentives for talented teachers to teach in troubled
54:1689:163993:20:21:72:243:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools will increase total productivity.
54:1690:164034:21:20:88:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Glazerman et al. (2013) used a randomized experiment in 10 districts across the nation to investigate the
54:1691:164139:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impact of filling vacancies with high-achieving teachers through the Talent Transfer Initiative (TTI). In each
54:1692:164249:20:21:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:district, the TTI offered teachers with consistently high value-added (ranking in the top 20 percent within
54:1693:164356:21:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their subject and grade) $20,000, paid over two years, to teach at low-achieving schools selected through
54:1694:164461:20:20:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a random process.  Principals of schools with low average test scores volunteered to fill vacancies at their
54:1695:164569:20:21:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school using the TTI. Schools that volunteered were matched based on the grade-level and subject of the
54:1696:164672:21:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vacancy as well as school demographics. Teacher teams (teachers grouped by grade and subject) within each
54:1697:164777:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:block of schools that had at least one vacancy were then randomly assigned to treatment or control. Teacher
54:1698:164884:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teams assigned to treatment status were eligible to fill their vacancy with a TTI teacher and vacancies in
54:1699:164990:21:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control teacher teams were filled using the typical process of the given school.  Note that high-performing
54:1700:165097:20:20:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers were not randomly assigned to these vacancies. After a teacher team is assigned to treatment, TTI
54:1701:165203:20:21:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers must interview for the position, principals must extend an offer to a TTI teacher, and then a TTI
54:1702:165309:21:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teacher must accept and voluntarily move to fill this vacancy. In order to receive the full financial incentive,
55:1703:165423:0:20:72:451:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high-performing teachers must remain in the low-achieving school for a full two years.
55:1704:165509:20:21:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Glazerman et al. (2013) investigated the impact of teacher teams being eligible to fill their vacancies us-
55:1705:165616:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing the TTI. Across the 10 districts included in the study, 165 teacher teams from 114 schools were randomly
55:1706:165724:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assigned to treatment (N= 85) or control (N=80). The transfer incentive was able to successfully attract high-
55:1707:165834:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achieving teachers. Eighty-eight percent of treatment vacancies were filled with teachers through the TTI. In
55:1708:165943:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:order to achieve this high rate of transfer, over 1,500 high-achieving teachers were invited to participate in
55:1709:166053:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:TTI. The teachers hired to fill treatment vacancies were significantly more experienced than teachers hired
55:1710:166160:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for control spots.  Treatment teachers had on average four years more experience and were 11 percentage
55:1711:166263:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:points more likely to have a National Board Certification than control teachers (CM = 9 percent).  Interest-
55:1712:166371:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ingly, there was evidence that principals reacted to the hiring of a TTI teacher by reallocating weak teachers
55:1713:166481:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be in the same team as the incoming TTI teacher.  Teachers from elsewhere in the school that joined a
55:1714:166585:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment teacher team after the hiring of a TTI teacher had five years less experience than teachers that
55:1715:166691:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:moved into a control teacher team. In addition, treatment teachers were more likely to provide mentoring to
55:1716:166798:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their peers (15 compared to 5 percent of the control teachers) and were less likely to receive mentoring (39
55:1717:166906:21:20:72:265:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:compared to 59 percent of control teachers).
55:1718:166950:20:20:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Glazerman et al.  (2013) found that the above first-stage and intermediate impacts translated into large
55:1719:167054:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects on student achievement tests for elementary schools but that there were no significant impacts on the
55:1720:167163:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement of middle school students. TTI eligible elementary classrooms increased students’ math scores
55:1721:167268:20:20:72:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by 0.18σand students’ reading scores by 0.10σin the first year after randomization. In the second year, the
55:1722:167375:20:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cumulative impacts for treatment students were 0.22σand 0.25σfor math and reading test scores, respec-
55:1723:167477:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tively. Although treatment elementary teachers had large impacts on their students, there were no spillover
55:1724:167584:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects for other teachers in their team.  Elementary student achievement outcomes were not significantly
55:1725:167689:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:different between students assigned to other teachers in the treatment team and students assigned to other
55:1726:167795:20:21:72:195:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers in the control team.
55:1727:167824:21:20:88:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, there was evidence that the TTI was effective at keeping these high-performing teachers in the
55:1728:167927:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:low-performing schools.  At the halfway point of the program, retention rates were higher for teachers that
55:1729:168034:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:filled TTI vacancies.  Treatment teachers were 23 percentage points more likely to remain in a school after
55:1730:168141:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the first year than their control counterparts (93 percent compared to 70 percent). In addition, retention rates
55:1731:168253:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:after the completion of the second year of the experiment were not statistically significant.  Approximately
55:1732:168361:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:60 percent of treatment teachers returned to the low-achieving school for a third, non-incentivized school
55:1733:168467:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year.  In comparison, a statistically indistinguishable 51 percent of control teachers remained in the fall of
55:1734:168577:20:0:72:164:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the third school year.
56:1735:168601:0:20:88:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The meta-coefficient on teacher incentives is 0.022σ(0.022) for math achievement and -0.006σ(0.012)
56:1736:168700:20:21:71:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for reading achievement.   Yet,  that number seems particularly misleading in this context as many of the
56:1737:168805:21:20:71:539:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schemes were quite ad hoc and inconsistent with economic theory. More experiments are needed before one

56:1755:170452:20:21:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concern is that professional development tends to be one-time workshops scheduled on “professional devel-

57:1769:171851:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:On average, teachers in the first intervention reported attending 39 hours of PD and teachers in the second
57:1770:171958:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention reported attending 47 hours of PD. In comparison, control teachers only reported attending 13
57:1771:172064:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hours of PD. Garet et al.  (2008) found that this exposure to PD lead to significant impacts on teachers’
57:1772:172169:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge and practices for both groups. Both interventions had positive impacts on second grade teachers’
57:1773:172275:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge of early reading content and instructional knowledge at posttest and a year after the PD programs
57:1774:172382:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:had completed.  For both years, teachers in both interventions used explicit instruction to a much greater
57:1775:172488:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:extent than teachers assigned to control.   However,  there was no significant difference in the amount of

57:1778:172819:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge and practices, there was no evidence that these changes had an impact on students’ test scores.

57:1781:173075:20:20:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another widely used PD program is Classroom Assessment of Student Learning (CASL). The program
57:1782:173169:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:set consists of a primary text, DVDs, ancillary books, and an implementation handbook. CASL is designed
57:1783:173272:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  be  a  self-executing  PD  program  where  teachers  learn  from  the  textbook  and  use  CASL  assessments
57:1784:173384:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  better  understand  their  own  and  their  students’  progress.   The  program  mostly  emphasizes  formative
57:1785:173498:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assessments,  but  also  includes  lessons  on  how  to  utilize  other  forms  of  classroom  assessments  such  as
57:1786:173614:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standardized test scores. The program is typically implemented via teacher learning teams, in which teachers
57:1787:173722:21:20:72:446:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can discuss and receive feedback from other teachers who are also using the program.

57:1789:173906:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers’ classroom assessment practices, Randel et al.  (2011) conducted a large randomized experiment.
57:1790:174010:21:20:72:431:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Due to regional needs, they decided to focus the study in mathematics classrooms.
57:1791:174091:20:20:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Almost 70 schools from 32 districts from across Colorado participated in the study. Schools volunteered
57:1792:174194:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to participate and were eligible if they were large enough to have at least one fourth grade and one fifth
57:1793:174300:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grade teacher.  The 67 eligible schools were then randomly assigned to a treatment group (N = 33) and a
57:1794:174403:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control group (N= 34).  In November of 2007, treatment schools received one set of CASL PD materials
57:1795:174503:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for each math teacher in fourth or fifth grade.  In total, there were 178 such teachers in treatment schools
57:1796:174611:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 231 teachers in control schools.  Treatment teachers participated in an introductory video conference
57:1797:174716:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the author of CASL and had access to a facilitator who had received training in the CASL program,
58:1798:174820:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:but  other  than  this,  the  experiment  was  completely  hands  off.   The  teachers  were  asked  to  use  the  PD
58:1799:174937:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:naturally without any input or requirements from the research team. The 2007-2008 school year was used as
58:1800:175042:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a training year during which teachers studied the CASL material and started integrating CASL practices into
58:1801:175149:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their classrooms.  The 2008-2009 year was the actual intervention year.  Fidelity of treatment was assessed
58:1802:175256:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using self-reported logs that 90 percent of teachers returned to the research team.  In order to combat the
58:1803:175363:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alternative hypothesis that any impact was just the result of the intervention schools having more resources,
58:1804:175472:20:20:72:224:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control schools were given $1,000.

58:1806:175610:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collected administrative and survey data from both the training and implementation year. The administrative
58:1807:175717:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data came directly from the Colorado Department of Education and contained state achievement test scores
58:1808:175821:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and student demographics.  In order to quantify students’ motivation to learn, researchers administered a
58:1809:175926:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student survey.  Further, teachers’ knowledge of classroom assessments, their classroom assessment prac-

58:1813:176245:20:20:72:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:class assessments.  Intervention teachers on average answered 2.78 questions more (0.42σ) correctly on a
58:1814:176349:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:60-item test about teachers’ knowledge of classroom assessments. However, there was no evidence that this
58:1815:176454:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:knowledge influenced their classroom practices. There were no significant differences in classroom practices
58:1816:176562:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the extent to which they involved their students in formative assessments.  Intervention teachers were

58:1825:177431:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for students in control classrooms was 501.91(2.44).  The impacts remain statistically insignificant when
58:1826:177536:20:32:72:234:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:looking at effect sizes by grade level.

59:1844:179101:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model. Schools that elect to adopt Success for All implement a program that organizes resources to attempt
59:1845:179207:20:20:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to ensure that every child will reach the third grade on time with adequate basic skills and will continue to
59:1846:179316:20:21:72:333:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:build on those skills throughout the later elementary grades.
59:1847:179377:21:20:88:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Borman et al.  (2007) use a cluster randomized trial design to evaluate the impacts of the Success for
59:1848:179479:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:All model on student achievement.  Forty-one schools from eleven states volunteered and were randomly
59:1849:179580:20:21:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assigned to either the treatment or control groups. Treatment schools implemented Success for All in grades
59:1850:179687:21:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:K-2 and control schools implemented the program in grades 3-5. Borman et al. (2007) present results three
59:1851:179792:20:20:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years after randomization for the baseline cohort of kindergarten students. Although forty-one schools were
59:1852:179899:20:21:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initially randomized, only thirty-five schools were included in the analysis due to six schools dropping out
59:1853:180007:21:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over the years for various reasons. The authors conclude that these thirty-five schools are still balanced and
59:1854:180117:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attrition is not a threat to their results.  Using standardized test scores from three subtests of the Woodcock
59:1855:180228:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Reading Mastery Test—Revised, Borman et al.  (2007) find that Success for All increased student achieve-

59:1858:180451:20:21:88:539:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another similar professional development program is Reading Recovery (RR). RR is a short-term in-
59:1859:180548:21:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tervention designed to help struggling readers in first grade catch up to their peers.  The program consists
60:1860:180658:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of students meeting one-on-one with a specially trained teacher every day for a 30-minute lesson over 12
60:1861:180762:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to 20 weeks.  The lessons are individualized by the RR teacher to fit to a student’s strengths and needs and
60:1862:180870:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:follow the RR model—focusing on phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension.
60:1863:180970:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:RR teachers undergo a year-long training procedure that takes place at designated training facilities and the
60:1864:181079:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools where they are assigned.  Through this training, they learn how to design and deliver daily lesson
60:1865:181185:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plans,  document lessons,  and to collect and effectively use different types of student progress data.   All
60:1866:181294:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:RR teachers are overseen by a teacher leader who has attended an intensive post-graduate program where
60:1867:181396:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they are expected to emerge as literary experts.  Literature on RR reports that approximately 75 percent of
60:1868:181503:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students enrolled in RR typically reach grade-level proficiency after participating in RR for the program’s in-

60:1871:181760:21:20:88:539:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Schwartz (2005) conducted the first randomized evaluation of RR in the United States.  In his study,
60:1872:181860:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thirty-seven first-grade teachers from across the nation identified two at-risk students in their classroom.
60:1873:181968:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:One student from each pair was randomly assigned to a treatment condition that received RR in the fall
60:1874:182070:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the other student was assigned to a control condition that received RR in the spring.  The participating
60:1875:182178:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers were all certified RR teachers and the program was active in their schools. The teachers gave up one
60:1876:182287:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of their four 30-minute RR slots to whichever student was randomly assigned to treatment. At the end of the
60:1877:182394:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first semester, Schwartz (2005) found that treatment students had large and significant impacts on various
60:1878:182500:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observation survey and standardized reading measures.  Effect sizes on the text level, letter identification,
60:1879:182609:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concepts about print, and hearing and recording sounds in words tasks on the observation survey ranged from
60:1880:182716:20:21:72:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.9σto 2.02σand treatment had an impact of 0.94σon scores from the Slosson Oral Reading Test—Revised.
60:1881:182817:21:20:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education awarded RR a $45 million i3 grant along with $10.1 million
60:1882:182917:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from private sources to fund a scale-up of RR across the nation.  The scale-up intends to reach over 2,000
60:1883:183023:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools and provide literary assistance to over 88,000 students.  May et al.  (2013) report the findings from

60:1885:183169:20:20:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:628 schools from across the nation were enrolled in the i3 scale-up of Reading Recovery. These schools
60:1886:183271:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were randomly assigned to three blocks and one of these blocks was randomly chosen to participate in a
60:1887:183373:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:RCT of Reading Recovery during the 2011-2012 school year.  Of the 209 schools in this block, only 156
60:1888:183474:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools actually carried out the randomization process described below and were included in the evaluation.
60:1889:183581:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Each school that participated in the RCT identified the eight lowest scoring students in their school using
60:1890:183688:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Observation Survey of Early Literacy. These eight students were matched according to their scores and

61:1892:183902:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This process resulted in 628 students in the treatment group and 625 students in the control group (when
61:1893:184006:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there were less than eight eligible students, odd number students were automatically assigned to treatment.
61:1894:184113:21:20:72:313:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These students were omitted from the impact analysis).

61:1904:184918:21:20:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:classroom teachers.  Yet while states and districts race to design new systems, most discussion of how the
61:1905:185024:20:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information might be used has focused on traditional human resource–management tasks, namely, hiring,
61:1906:185125:20:21:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:firing, and compensation. By contrast, very little is known about how the availability of new information, or
61:1907:185234:21:20:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the experience of being evaluated, might change teacher effort and effectiveness.  Dobbie and Fryer (2013)
61:1908:185340:20:20:72:486:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:report that teacher feedback is one of the variables most correlated with charter school success.
61:1909:185437:20:21:88:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the research reported here, we study one approach to teacher feedback:  practice-based assessment
61:1910:185537:21:20:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that relies on multiple, highly structured classroom observations conducted by experienced peer teachers
61:1911:185641:20:20:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and administrators.  While this approach contrasts with principal walk-through styles of class observation,
61:1912:185748:20:21:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:its use is on the rise in new and proposed evaluation systems in which rigorous classroom observation is
61:1913:185852:21:20:72:484:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:often combined with other measures, such as teacher value-added based on student test scores.
61:1914:185945:20:20:88:539:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Proponents of evaluation systems that include high-quality classroom observations point to their poten-
61:1915:186048:20:21:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tial value for improving instruction (see “Capturing the Dimensions of Effective Teaching,” Features, Fall
61:1916:186154:21:20:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2012).  Individualized, specific information about performance is especially scarce in the teaching profes-
61:1917:186261:20:20:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sion, suggesting that a lack of information on how to improve could be a substantial barrier to individual
61:1918:186367:20:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:improvement among teachers.  Well-designed evaluations might fill that knowledge gap in several ways.
61:1919:186468:21:20:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:First, teachers could gain information through the formal scoring and feedback routines of an evaluation
61:1920:186572:20:20:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program.  Second, evaluation could encourage teachers to be generally more self-reflective, regardless of
61:1921:186677:20:21:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the evaluative criteria. Third, the evaluation process could create more opportunities for conversations with
61:1922:186786:21:0:72:328:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other teachers and administrators about effective practices.

62:1924:186962:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:raising student achievement during the school year when they are being evaluated as opposed to previous
62:1925:187065:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years,  and even more effective in the years after evaluation.  A student instructed by a teacher after that

62:1932:187652:20:21:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher management quality and better educational outcomes.  Dobbie and Fryer (2013) use variation in the
62:1933:187756:21:20:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:management practices of New York City charter schools to investigate the characteristics that differentiate
62:1934:187863:20:20:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those that increase student achievement (as measured by standardized test scores) and those that do not
62:1935:187966:20:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase achievement.  Using survey and administrative data from 39 New York City charter schools, they
62:1936:188069:21:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlated the policies of each school with the school’s individual impact on math and reading achievement.
62:1937:188176:20:20:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Dobbie and Fryer (2013) report that traditional inputs (i.e.  class size, per pupil expenditure, the fraction of

62:1945:188944:20:21:71:539:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:driven reform on student achievement in mathematics and reading.  The study included over 500 schools
62:1946:189045:21:20:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from 59 school districts across seven states.   Districts randomly assigned to treatment implemented a 3-
62:1947:189150:20:20:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year data-driven reform initiative with the support of consultants from the Johns Hopkins Center for Data-
62:1948:189256:20:21:71:539:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Driven Reform in Education (CDDRE). Control districts implemented the same initiative, but one year after
62:1949:189361:21:20:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:random assignment.  Carlson et al.  (2011) utilize the delayed start to investigate the causal impacts of the
62:1950:189470:20:20:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first year of the CDDRE initiative on student achievement outcomes. The first year of the CDDRE initiative
62:1951:189576:20:21:71:539:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:focuses on developing and evaluating quarterly benchmark assessments, reviewing all available data to better

63:1954:189814:20:21:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The participating districts were selected through an extensive recruitment process.  The Department of
63:1955:189916:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Education of each state nominated districts with a large number of low performing schools to participate
63:1956:190020:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the study. District officials of the nominated districts were contacted and those that agreed to participate
63:1957:190131:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were included in the randomization procedure.  Further, for each participating district, the district officials
63:1958:190242:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specified which schools in their district they wanted to participate in the experiment.  Generally, low per-
63:1959:190350:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forming schools were selected.  Following the selection of schools, districts were stratified by recruitment
63:1960:190458:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wave and state and randomly assigned to treatment or control.  Treatment schools implemented CDDRE
63:1961:190556:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data-driven initiative and control schools continued business-as-usual for one year and then implemented
63:1962:190660:20:20:72:154:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the same initiative.
63:1963:190680:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In order to assess the impact of the intervention, results from state-administered achievement tests were
63:1964:190785:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collected for each participating school.  Carlson et al.  (2011) found treatment had a significant impact on
63:1965:190893:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student math scores but found no significant effect for reading scores – treatment schools increased students’
63:1966:191003:20:21:72:460:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:math scores by 0.059σ(0.029) and increased students’ reading scores by 0.033σ(0.020).
63:1967:191088:21:20:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to providing constructive feedback for teachers, collecting teacher data could also be a useful
63:1968:191195:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tool for leaders in managing their schools.  Rockoff et al.  (2012) investigate the impact of giving over 200

63:1970:191409:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in NYC that contained any grades four through eight were eligible to participate (over 1,000 schools); 223
63:1971:191515:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signed up and completed the necessary survey to be included in the experiment.  Participating principals
63:1972:191619:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were stratified by grade configuration and assigned randomly to treatment or control.  Treatment principals
63:1973:191726:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:received reports detailing the value-added of the teachers in their school relative to similar teachers in NYC
63:1974:191836:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  training  on  how  to  use  and  interpret  this  data.   Rockoff  et  al.   (2012)  find  evidence  that  principals
63:1975:191958:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:do  use  this  information  to  update  their  beliefs  of  the  teachers  in  the  school.   Using  baseline  and  post-
63:1976:192079:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention surveys that solicited principals’ evaluation of their teachers, they find that treatment principals
63:1977:192192:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:update their beliefs in the direction of the teacher value-added detailed in the report.  Moreover, consistent
63:1978:192302:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a Bayesian learning model, principals put more weight on the teacher value-added information when
63:1979:192404:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that information is more precise than their prior beliefs and they put more weight on their prior beliefs when
63:1980:192514:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the relative precision is reversed.   Providing this information to principals led to an increase in turnover
63:1981:192623:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for teachers with low performance estimates and had a positive impact on students’ math achievement for
63:1982:192726:20:33:72:444:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students assigned to teachers that remained in the intervention throughout its entirety.

64:1984:192828:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Project STAR was an experiment carried out in 79 Tennessee schools from 1985 to 1989 where 11,600
64:1985:192925:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students in grades K to 3 were randomly assigned to small classes (13-17 students), regular classes (22-
64:1986:193029:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:25 students), or regular classes with a full-time aide.  At the time, the statewide pupil-to-teacher ratio was
64:1987:193139:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:22.3,  so regular classes represented close to the average classroom size in the state.   At the time of the
64:1988:193247:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiment, kindergarten was not compulsory in Tennessee, so many new students entered schools in first
64:1989:193350:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grade. Students who entered a participating school after the 1985-1986 school year were randomly assigned
64:1990:193455:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to one of the three types of classes.  Additionally, students in regular classes and in regular classes with
64:1991:193563:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an aide were randomly reassigned between these two types of classes at the end of kindergarten. However,
64:1992:193667:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:kindergartners initially assigned to small classes remained in small classes throughout the entire experiment.
64:1993:193777:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using a student’s initial assignment to one of the three groups, Krueger (1999) estimated the impact of
64:1994:193880:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reduced class size and teacher aides on an index of scores from the math, reading, and word subtests of
64:1995:193983:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Stanford Achievement Test.  Krueger (1999) found that for grades K-3, students scored about five to
64:1996:194086:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:seven percentile points higher on the index than students assigned to a regular class without an aide. These
64:1997:194194:20:21:72:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results correspond to effect sizes in the range of 0.19σ-0.28σand represent 64 to 82 percent of the white-
64:1998:194300:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:black test score gap in the data.  Additionally, there was some evidence that regular classrooms with aides
64:1999:194407:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outperformed regular classrooms without aides—the estimates for aide classrooms tended to be small and
64:2000:194509:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive, but only the first grade results were statistically significant with an impact of 1.48 percentile points.
64:2001:194624:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:When exploring heterogeneous treatment effects, Krueger (1999) found that smaller class sizes were more
64:2002:194727:20:32:72:310:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effective for students on free lunch and black students.

64:2004:194798:20:21:88:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There are very few randomized trials that expose students to higher quantities of schooling. Zvoch and
64:2005:194900:21:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stevens (2012) show that a summer literacy program has enormous impacts on kindergarten and first grade
64:2006:195003:20:20:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reading test scores. In this study, the researchers invited students to a five-week summer program that lasted
64:2007:195113:20:21:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for 3.5 hours a day, four days a week.  In the program, students received classroom instruction on funda-
64:2008:195218:21:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mental literacy topics, were assigned homework, completed in-class work packets, and practiced literacy
64:2009:195321:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:skills in small groups with students of a similar skill level.  The summer program was typically reserved
64:2010:195426:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for struggling students that scored below a cutoff point on the spring standardized tests.  However, for this
64:2011:195535:21:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:study, the district established upper bounds so that approximately 50 kindergartners and 50 first graders fell
64:2012:195645:20:20:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the range between the cutoff scores and the upper bound scores.  These students were considered the
64:2013:195747:20:21:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experimental sample and half were randomly invited to participate in the program.  At posttest, Zvoch and
64:2014:195852:21:0:72:539:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Stevens (2012) found that the summer program on average increased reading test scores by 0.69σfor the
65:2015:195955:0:20:72:233:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:kindergarten and first grade students.
65:2016:195993:20:21:88:539:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However, Holmes and McConnell (1990) utilized a larger sample of students to investigate the impact of
65:2017:196095:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:full-day versus half-day kindergarten instruction and found no significantly positive impacts.  In fact, their
65:2018:196205:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:study provided evidence that half-day kindergarten students perform better on math achievement tests than
65:2019:196310:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:full-day kindergartners.  The experiment randomly assigned twenty elementary schools to either a full or
65:2020:196414:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:half-day schedule.  Holmes and McConnell found that full-day kindergartners had math scores that were
65:2021:196515:20:20:72:429:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.29σlower and reading scores that were 0.11σhigher than the half-day students.
65:2022:196594:20:21:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An experiment that investigated extended day impacts in a slightly older sample was Meyer and Van
65:2023:196691:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Klaveren (2013).  This experiment randomly invited Dutch 5th, 6th, and 7th grade students to participate
65:2024:196795:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in an extended school day program.  The program consisted of a classroom of approximately ten students
65:2025:196897:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:receiving an additional two hours of language instruction, two hours of math instruction, and one hour of
65:2026:197002:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:excursions per week. Meyer and Van Klaveren found that assignment to treatment increased math scores by
65:2027:197105:20:20:72:521:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.087σ(0.067) and increased reading scores by 0.005σ(0.081). Neither of these effects are significant.
65:2028:197207:20:21:88:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Taking the treatment effects at face value, one potential explanation for the patterns in the experimental
65:2029:197313:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data is that increasing the amount of time students spend in class per day is not as effective as extending the
65:2030:197424:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school year.  Put differently, if there are concavities in human capital production as a function of time and
65:2031:197533:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students are at the point of diminishing marginal returns for a given day but not for a given year, this can
65:2032:197641:21:36:72:175:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rationalize the findings.

65:2034:197698:27:21:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In recent years,  developed countries across the globe have increased the scope of schooling alternatives
65:2035:197803:21:20:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:available to students—an approach long advocated by leading economists (Friedman 1955; Becker 1995;
65:2036:197902:20:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Hoxby 2002).  Creating a competitive and active marketplace has the potential to improve educational out-
65:2037:198007:20:21:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comes because schools would have more incentive to improve in response to increased market pressure. To
65:2038:198110:21:20:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the extent that match quality between a school and a student is important, school choice programs may also
65:2039:198216:20:20:72:473:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:yield benefits simply by increasing the set of schools over which a student is able to choose.
65:2040:198310:20:21:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For these approaches to be an effective means of reform, however, it is necessary that students benefit
65:2041:198413:21:20:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the opportunity to attend sought-after schools, and that these improvements are apparent to students
65:2042:198518:20:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and parents.  The goal of this subsection is to understand the measurable achievement benefits accrued to
65:2043:198623:20:33:72:322:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students when there is more flexibility and school choice.

66:2047:198901:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vouchers to a limited number of low-income students to attend one of three private nonsectarian schools in
66:2048:199007:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the district, is the most prominent of these. Analyses of this program obtain sharply conflicting estimates of
66:2049:199117:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the impact on achievement depending upon the assumptions made to deal with selective attrition of lottery
66:2050:199222:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:losers from the sample (Witte et al. 1995; Greene et al. 1999; Witte 1997; Rouse 1998). Although in theory
66:2051:199328:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomization provides an ideal context for evaluating the benefits of expanding parental choice sets, in the
66:2052:199437:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Milwaukee case, less than half of the unsuccessful applicants returned to the public schools and those who
66:2053:199543:21:20:72:387:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did return were from less educated, lower income families (Witte 1997).
66:2054:199614:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Rouse (1998) used a typical ITT specification to evaluate the Milwaukee voucher program.  Compar-

66:2056:199818:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacts on math achievement but insignificant impacts on reading. Students who won the lottery scored ap-
66:2057:199923:20:20:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:proximately 1.5-2.3 percentile points (0.08σ-0.12σ) more per year in math compared to lottery losers. This
66:2058:200029:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests effect sizes on the order of 0.32σ-0.48σfor four years of school.  The results in Rouse (1998) are
66:2059:200136:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:robust to various methods of imputing missing data and attrition from the sample – when imputing missing
66:2060:200240:20:20:72:415:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observations, estimates remained in the range of 1.38 to 2.31 percentile points.
66:2061:200320:20:21:88:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) is another voucher program that provides up to $7,500
66:2062:200418:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to low-income families in the District of Columbia to send their children to participating private schools.
66:2063:200525:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Wolf et al. (2010) use 2,300 applicants to a series of lotteries in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the impact of the
66:2064:200636:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:OSP. The study found that the OSP had no impact on student achievement but increased students’ chance of
66:2065:200740:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:graduation. Additionally, parents of students who were offered a scholarship had a higher satisfaction with
66:2066:200847:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools and rated schools as safer. This result is significant regardless of whether a student actually used the
66:2067:200959:20:20:72:187:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:offered scholarship or not.

66:2069:201089:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Scholarships Foundation Program in NYC. In 1997,  the program provided scholarships of up to $1,400
66:2070:201188:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:annually for up to four years via lottery to low-income families with students in grades K-4. The scholarship
66:2071:201297:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could be used to pay tuition at a religious or secular school of the family’s choosing. Fifty-three percent of
66:2072:201407:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students who were offered scholarships used the scholarship for at least three full years.  The families that
66:2073:201516:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:did not utilize the offered scholarship claimed they were unable to do so because they were unable to afford
66:2074:201624:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the tuition and expenses that the scholarship did not cover or were unable to find a school in a convenient
66:2075:201731:21:20:72:110:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:location.
66:2076:201740:20:0:88:539:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Through parent and student surveys, Mayer et al.  (2002) found that the private schools these students
67:2077:201844:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:elected to attend were indeed different from the public schools non-participants remained in.  Parents with
67:2078:201951:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students who switched to private schools reported that the schools had smaller class sizes; were more likely
67:2079:202059:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to have computer laboratories,  after-school programs,  and tutor programs;  had less incidents of students
67:2080:202166:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:destroying property, fighting, cheating, and racial conflict; communicated more with parents; allowed par-
67:2081:202272:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ents to spend less time helping their children with homework; and this resulted in an overall higher level of
67:2082:202381:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:satisfaction with their students’ school. Students who switched reported that students in private school were
67:2083:202490:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more likely to get along with teachers, were more proud of their school, were less likely to be put down
67:2084:202594:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by teachers, and were asked to complete more homework.  Additinoally, students reported that the private
67:2085:202698:21:20:72:425:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools had stricter behavior rules, and there was a lower prevalence of cheating.
67:2086:202780:20:20:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Although there was evidence that students offered a scholarship switched to better school environments,
67:2087:202883:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Mayer et al.  (2002) found that three years after random assignment, there was no average treatment effect
67:2088:202989:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on students’ performance. Moreover, students who ever attended a private school and students who attended
67:2089:203094:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for all three years did no better than students who never attended a private school.  These results are robust
67:2090:203204:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across grade levels,  but there is evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects across races – Mayer et al.
67:2091:203310:21:31:72:412:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2002) found positive effects on the standardized test scores of black students.
67:2092:203390:31:20:88:540:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The meta-coefficient on voucher experiments is 0.024σ(0.021) for math achievement and 0.030σ(0.024)
67:2093:203489:20:20:72:540:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for reading achievement.  Relative to their popularity with politicians, the lack of effectiveness of voucher
67:2094:203598:20:20:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:programs is surprising.  Rather than focusing on achievement, many use a revealed preference argument to
67:2095:203702:20:21:72:487:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conclude families who make active choices – even if achievement is unaffected – are better off.
67:2096:203797:21:20:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Before one dismisses them entirely, there are two key pieces of data missing on voucher experiments.
67:2097:203897:20:20:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:First, in the average voucher experiment a student enrolls in a private school between grades K and 8. There
67:2098:204005:20:21:72:529:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is no experiment that tests the full pre-K through high school graduation treatment. This seems essential.
67:2099:204111:21:20:88:539:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, although vouchers are a market-based reform, we do not know what happens if there are enough
67:2100:204211:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vouchers in a concentrated area to allow the market to respond by altering the supply (and scope) of schools
67:2101:204319:20:21:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:available to educate disadvantaged children.  Because all the experiments have been relatively small, one
67:2102:204424:21:16:72:318:192:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:cannot assess the potential general equilibrium effects.27
67:2103:204482:16:14:84:539:176:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:27A notable counter example is a recent experiment implemented in India.  Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2015) conducted
67:2104:204602:14:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:an experiment using 180 villages from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in which they randomly assigned villages to treatment
67:2105:204728:11:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:or control and then awarded private school vouchers to public school applicants through random lotteries in the treatment villages.
67:2106:204859:11:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Two and four years after randomization,  they found that winning a voucher had no impact on Telugu (native language),  math,
67:2107:204983:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:English, and science/social studies achievement. However, the program had large impacts on Hindi test scores, a subject not taught
67:2108:205113:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:in public schools.  Since private schools are approximately a third of the cost of public schools, Muralidharan and Sundararaman
67:2109:205241:11:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(2015) conclude that private schools are a much more cost-effective way of teaching students.  Further, they found no evidence of
67:2110:205370:11:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:spillovers (negative or positive) on the achievement of public school students that did not apply to the voucher program or on non-
67:2111:205501:11:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:voucher private students.  This suggests that vouchers are a cost-effective way to potentially increase student achievement without
67:2112:205632:11:0:72:165:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:any negative externalities.
68:2113:205661:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An ideal voucher experiment might take a large state with multiple school districts and randomly im-
68:2114:205761:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plement voucher programs or Education Savings Accounts in half of the districts and analyze both student
68:2115:205865:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement and the market response.  The vouchers could be risk adjusted – more disadvantaged children
68:2116:205968:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:receive more school funding – or contain location preferences that would induce a more aggressive supply
68:2117:206072:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:response in blighted communities. These ideas only scratch the surface of what is possible and have not been
68:2118:206180:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluated in a compelling way. Thus, whether the Friedman (1955) vision for public schools is effective at
68:2119:206286:20:32:72:255:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:producing human capital is still unknown.

68:2122:206443:20:20:71:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of student outcomes.  Specifically, they utilize the random lotteries of oversubscribed schools in Chicago’s
68:2123:206551:20:21:71:539:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:open  enrollment  system.   This  system  allows  students  to  apply  to  public  magnet  schools  and  programs
68:2124:206664:21:20:71:539:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outside of their neighborhood school.28When oversubscribed, many Chicago Public Schools (CPS) use
68:2125:206761:20:20:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:random lotteries to offer admission to students.  The authors obtained the results of 194 such lotteries from
68:2126:206870:20:21:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:19  high  schools  in  CPS.  The  final  sample  consisted  of  14,434  students  who  applied  to  these  19  choice

68:2138:208034:20:20:88:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another possibility is that students and parents apply to choice schools for non-academic reasons. Using

68:2141:208347:20:20:71:539:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:traditional outcomes, possibly supporting the hypothesis that students and parents choose choice schools for
68:2142:208455:20:22:71:539:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-academic reasons. Cullen, Jacob, and Levitt (2006) found that lottery winners report fewer incidents of
68:2143:208562:22:14:84:539:88:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:28Magnet schools are different from traditional public schools in that each magnet school tends to have a specific educational
68:2144:208688:14:0:72:411:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:theme and students can choose to enroll in a school based on their interest in a school’s theme.

69:2148:209039:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another example of a school choice experiment is Connecticut’s interdistrict magnet school program.
69:2149:209138:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In 1996, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that students in Hartford public schools were denied equal
69:2150:209241:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:educational  opportunities  due  to  racial  and  economic  isolation.   One  of  the  state’s  many  responses  was
69:2151:209357:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to foster the growth of interdistrict magnet schools.  A decade after the the Connecticut Supreme Court’s
69:2152:209462:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ruling, there were 54 magnet schools in operation in Connecticut and 41 of these served students residing
69:2153:209567:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Hartford, New Haven, or Waterbury.  Additionally, interdistrict magnets serve two or more districts and
69:2154:209673:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all students residing in these districts are eligible to enroll in the school. Urban students that elect to attend
69:2155:209787:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:magnet schools are typically moving to schools where there are fewer students eligible for free lunch, more
69:2156:209894:21:20:72:461:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:white students, and higher average scores on standardized mathematics and reading tests.
69:2157:209982:20:20:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Bifulco et al.  (2009) evaluated the impact of Connecticut’s interdistrict magnet schools using the ran-

69:2159:210186:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:districts.  One of these schools served grades 6-8 and the other served grades 6-12.  The authors obtained
69:2160:210292:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:admission data for the 2003 and 2004 sixth grade lotteries at these schools as well as student-level test

69:2162:210499:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The final sample for these two schools consisted of 553 students in 12 oversubscribed lotteries (both schools

69:2168:211040:20:21:88:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A charter school is a school that receives public funding but operates independently of the established
69:2169:211143:21:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:public school system in which it is located. They exist (and are increasing in demand) across the developed
69:2170:211250:20:20:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:world  –  from  Australia  to  England  and  Wales.   Figure  2  shows  the  increase  in  the  number  of  students
69:2171:211366:20:21:71:329:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attending charter schools in the United States and England.
69:2172:211425:21:20:88:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:When originally conceived, charter schools offered two distinct promises:  First, they were to serve as
69:2173:211528:20:20:71:539:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an escape hatch for students in failing schools.  Second, they were to use their legal and financial freedoms
69:2174:211637:20:21:71:539:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to create and incubate new educational practices that could be used to inform traditional public schools with
69:2175:211746:21:0:71:212:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:new ideas and fresh approaches.
70:2176:211779:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In America, charter schools currently enroll almost four percent of all students.  Some of these schools
70:2177:211883:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have shown remarkable success in increasing test scores – closing the racial achievement gap in just a few
70:2178:211989:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years. For example, schools such as the Success Academy Charter Schools in New York City, YES Prep in
70:2179:212090:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Houston, and charter schools in the Harlem Children’s Zone have become beacons of hope, demonstrating
70:2180:212191:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the enormous potential to improve student achievement in the most blighted communities. Others, however,
70:2181:212295:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have failed to increase achievement and have actually performed substantially worse than their traditional
70:2182:212401:20:32:72:493:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:counterparts. In this scenario, students would have been better off not attending a charter school.

70:2184:212526:21:20:88:540:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The method for evaluating charter schools is remarkably consistent across the literature.29The literature
70:2185:212631:20:20:72:540:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates two empirical models – ITT effects and Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs) – which provide

70:2201:213832:21:20:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the charter school.  Using this approach, the literature on charter effectiveness has quickly amassed an
70:2202:213939:20:20:72:171:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interesting set of facts.
70:2203:213964:20:20:88:539:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:First, the typical charter school is no more effective at increasing test scores than the typical traditional
70:2204:214073:20:21:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:public school (Gleason et al. 2010). Evaluations that encompass the most representative samples of charter
70:2205:214179:21:20:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools show little impact.  Using lottery admissions data for 36 charter schools from around the nation,
70:2206:214284:20:26:72:540:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Gleason et al.  (2010) investigated the impact of charter schools on student outcomes.  They found that two
70:2207:214391:26:14:84:539:110:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:29The national charter school studies released by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) are anomalous in
70:2208:214511:14:8:72:531:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:that they use observational data instead of randomized admissions lotteries (Center for Research on Education Outcomes 2013).
70:2209:214636:8:14:84:539:88:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:30In typical charter lotteries, an offer is extended to all siblings when multiple siblings enter the same lottery and one sibling
70:2210:214766:14:0:72:91:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:wins.
71:2211:214773:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years after the random lotteries, students who won the lotteries scored, if anything, lower on standardized
71:2212:214880:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:test scores than students who lost the lotteries.31In addition, this national sample of charter schools had
71:2213:214987:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no impact on students’ math and reading proficiency levels, number of days absent, and grade promotion.
71:2214:215090:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Gleason et al. (2010) found no impact of charter schools on student behavior and school disciplinary action,
71:2215:215198:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:but a higher fraction of lottery winners showed up late to school five or more days.  Although the average
71:2216:215304:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:charter school included in their study did not have any positive impacts on student outcomes, Gleason et al.
71:2217:215412:20:20:72:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2010) found large, positive, and statistically significant impacts – ranging from 0.07σto 0.94σ– on every

71:2219:215596:21:20:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, an emerging body of research suggests that high-performing charter schools can significantly
71:2220:215696:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase the achievement of poor urban students.  Students attending over-subscribed Boston-area charter
71:2221:215800:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools score approximately 0.4σhigher per year in math and 0.2σhigher per year in reading (Abdulka-

71:2227:216415:20:21:88:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Third, charter schools are more effective at increasing math scores than reading scores. Abdulkadiroglu
71:2228:216518:21:20:71:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al.  (2011) and Angrist et al.  (2011) find that the treatment effect of attending an oversubscribed charter
71:2229:216629:20:20:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school is four times as large for math as reading.  Dobbie and Fryer (2011) demonstrate effects that are
71:2230:216733:20:20:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost 5 times as large in middle school and 1.6 times as large in elementary school in favor of math.  In
71:2231:216839:20:21:71:539:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:larger samples, Hoxby and Murarka (2009) report an effect size 2.5 times as large in New York City charters,
71:2232:216947:21:20:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Gleason et al.  (2010) show that an average urban charter school increases math scores by 0.16σwith
71:2233:217050:20:20:71:208:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistically 0 effect on reading.
71:2234:217084:20:21:88:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:According  to  the  National  Alliance  for  Public  Charter  Schools,  the  median  grade  served  by  charter

71:2237:217408:20:21:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ond grade students, so the average grade evaluated is most likely even higher.  The theory and empirical
71:2238:217512:21:20:71:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:findings discussed above suggest that the relatively late timing of charter school “interventions” might be an
71:2239:217622:20:32:71:348:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important factor in the observed differential impacts by subject.
71:2240:217687:32:14:84:540:110:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:31The two-year ITT impact for the pooled sample is -0.08σ(p-value = 0.032) for reading scores and -0.06σ(p-value = 0.136)
71:2241:217808:14:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:for math test scores. Note that pooling results together masks heterogeneous treatment effects described in the paper. For example,
71:2242:217939:11:11:72:539:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f8:F:charter schools in large urban areas had a 0.16σimpact on math scores while schools outside of large urban areas had a -0.14σ
71:2243:218064:11:0:72:284:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:impact. Both of these impacts were statistically significant.
72:2244:218127:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another leading theory posits that reading scores are influenced by the language spoken when students
72:2245:218228:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are outside of the classroom (Rickford 1999; Charity, Scarborough, and Griffin 2004). Charity, Scarborough,
72:2246:218335:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  Griffin  (2004)  argue  that  if  students  speak  nonstandard  English  at  home  and  in  their  communities,
72:2247:218451:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing reading scores might be especially difficult.  This theory is consistent with the data and could
72:2248:218558:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explain why students at an urban boarding school make similar progress on reading and math (Curto and
72:2249:218659:21:20:72:127:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Fryer 2014).
72:2250:218671:20:20:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Fourth,  there are important features of charter schools that seem to be correlated with their level of
72:2251:218774:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student achievement. It is important to note that these analyses are non-experimental. Angrist et al. (2013)
72:2252:218882:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:argue that both the urbanicity of charter schools and whether they adopt the so called “No Excuses” approach

72:2254:219069:20:21:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Dobbie and Fryer (2013) provide evidence on the determinants of charter school effectiveness by col-
72:2255:219169:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lecting data on the inner-workings of 29 charter schools in New York City and correlating these data with
72:2256:219274:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lottery-based estimates of each school’s effectiveness. Information on school practices were collected from
72:2257:219381:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a variety of sources.  Principal interviews asked about teacher development, instructional time, data driven
72:2258:219489:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instruction, parent outreach, and school culture. Teacher interviews asked about professional development,
72:2259:219595:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school policies,  school culture,  and student assessment.   Student interviews asked about school environ-
72:2260:219702:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment, school disciplinary policy, and future aspirations. Lesson plans were used to measure curricular rigor.
72:2261:219811:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Videotaped classroom observations were used to calculate the fraction of students on task throughout the
72:2262:219915:20:20:72:121:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school day.
72:2263:219926:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:School effectiveness is estimated by exploiting the fact that oversubscribed charter schools in New York
72:2264:220030:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:City are required to admit students via random lottery.  The variability inherent in the set of NYC charter
72:2265:220137:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools, combined with rich measures of school inputs and lottery-based estimates of each school’s impact
72:2266:220242:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on student achievement, provides an ideal opportunity to understand which inputs best explain school ef-
72:2267:220346:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fectiveness.   This,  coupled with some of the best practices of our meta-analysis,  provide the intellectual
72:2268:220455:21:20:72:314:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:backbone of the randomized field trial discussed below.
72:2269:220510:20:20:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Dobbie and Fryer (2013) find that input measures associated with a traditional resource-based model of
72:2270:220612:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:education – class size, per pupil expenditure, the fraction of teachers with no teaching certification, and the
72:2271:220723:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fraction of teachers with an advanced degree – are not correlated with school effectiveness in our sample.
72:2272:220829:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Indeed, our data suggest that increasing resource-based inputs may marginally lower school effectiveness.
72:2273:220934:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:On the surface, this evidence may seem inconsistent with the important results reported in Krueger (1999).
72:2274:221040:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There are a few ways to reconcile this.  First, Dobbie and Fryer (2013) analyzes charter schools in NYC,
72:2275:221144:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereas Krueger (1999) uses a sample of traditional public schools in Tennessee.  Second, the variation in
73:2276:221252:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Dobbie and Fryer (2013) comes from only 39 charter schools with relatively similar class sizes, whereas
73:2277:221355:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the thousands of treatment students in Krueger (1999) are placed in classrooms that are almost 40% smaller
73:2278:221461:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than control classrooms. Third, Krueger’s analysis focused on students in grades kindergarten through third
73:2279:221568:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereas the correlations in Dobbie and Fryer (2013) used third through eighth grade test scores. Fourth, and
73:2280:221676:20:21:72:349:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:most important, the analysis in Krueger (1999) is experimental.
73:2281:221739:21:20:88:539:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In stark contrast, Dobbie and Fryer (2013) demonstrate that an index of five policies suggested by forty
73:2282:221843:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years of human capital research – frequent teacher feedback, data-driven instruction, high-dosage tutoring,
73:2283:221950:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increased instructional time, and a relentless focus on academic achievement – explains roughly half of the
73:2284:222057:21:44:72:326:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation in school effectiveness in both math and reading.

73:2286:222186:27:31:93:160:477:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:A:in Houston
73:2287:222196:31:21:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Improving the efficiency of the production of human capital is of great importance across the developed
73:2288:222299:21:20:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:world.  The United States spends $10,768 per pupil on primary and secondary education, ranking it fourth
73:2289:222403:20:20:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among OECD countries (Aud et al.  2011).  Yet, among these same countries, American fifteen year-olds
73:2290:222504:20:20:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rank twenty-fifth in math achievement, seventeenth in science, and fourteenth in reading (Fleischman 2010).
73:2291:222611:20:21:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This is not a phenomenon that is unique to the United States. Other OECD countries are unable to translate
73:2292:222717:21:20:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:large amounts of educational spending into educational success.  For example, the two countries ranking
73:2293:222820:20:20:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:directly behind the United States with per pupil primary and secondary spending of $9,959 and $9,448 are,
73:2294:222925:20:21:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respectively, Austria and Denmark (Aud et al.  2011).  However, Austrian fifteen year-olds rank eighteenth
73:2295:223031:21:20:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in math achievement, twenty-fourth in science, and thirty-first in reading and Danish fifteen year-olds rank
73:2296:223139:20:20:72:445:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thirteenth in math, twentieth in science, and nineteenth in reading (Fleischman 2010).
73:2297:223225:20:21:88:539:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Traditionally, there have been two approaches to increasing educational efficiency: (1) expand the scope
73:2298:223329:21:20:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of available educational options in the hope that the market will drive out ineffective schools, or (2) directly
73:2299:223441:20:20:72:329:202:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:manipulate inputs to the educational production function.32
73:2300:223500:20:21:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As our meta-analysis demonstrates,  market-based reforms such as school choice or school vouchers
73:2301:223597:21:20:72:540:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have, at best, a modest impact on student achievement. This suggests that these approaches – implemented
73:2302:223701:20:20:72:540:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in their current form – are unlikely to significantly increase the efficiency of the public school system, subject
73:2303:223815:20:22:72:324:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the important caveats discussed in the previous section.
73:2304:223874:22:14:84:539:99:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:32Increasing standards and accountability reflect a third approach to education reform. There is evidence that increased account-
73:2305:224003:14:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:ability via the No Child Left Behind Act had a positive impact on math test scores (though not reading test scores) and on wages
73:2306:224131:11:0:72:227:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(Dee and Jacob 2011; Deming et al. 2013).
74:2307:224174:0:20:88:539:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another approach is to inject the best practices known from the set of randomized field experiments
74:2308:224273:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:completed  to  date  –  along  with  the  correlates  gleaned  from  analyzing  the  inner-workings  of  successful
74:2309:224388:21:20:72:534:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:charter schools – in an experiment in traditional public schools. This is precisely the goal of Fryer (2014).
74:2310:224497:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Between the 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 school years, Fryer (2014) implemented important elements of
74:2311:224593:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the above education best-practices in twenty of the lowest performing schools (containing more than 12,000
74:2312:224699:21:20:72:196:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students) in Houston, Texas.
74:2313:224727:20:20:88:539:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To increase time on task, the school day was lengthened by one hour and the school year was lengthened
74:2314:224829:20:21:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by ten days in the nine secondary (middle and high) schools. This was 21 percent more time in school than
74:2315:224934:21:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students in these schools spent in the pre-treatment year and roughly the same as achievement-increasing
74:2316:225038:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:charter schools in New York City.  In addition, students were strongly encouraged and even incentivized
74:2317:225141:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to attend classes on Saturday.  In the eleven elementary schools, the length of the day and the year were
74:2318:225246:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not changed, but non-instructional activities (e.g.  twenty-minute bathroom breaks) were reduced.  This is
74:2319:225352:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the correlations in Dobbie and Fryer (2013) and the randomized field trial reported in Meyer
74:2320:225460:20:21:72:184:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Van Klaveren (2013).
74:2321:225484:21:20:88:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In an effort to improve the human capital available to teach students and lead schools, nineteen out of
74:2322:225587:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:twenty principals were removed and 46 percent of teachers left or were removed before the experiment
74:2323:225687:20:21:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:began.  Some teachers left because they believed the program was too disruptive.  Others were removed
74:2324:225788:21:20:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because they were too resistant to the changes.  Any teacher, independent of skill level, who demonstrated
74:2325:225894:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a desire to implement the proposed changes with fidelity was retained.  As part of the turnaround efforts,
74:2326:226000:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:teachers received both managed professional development and frequent feedback as a part of a more holistic
74:2327:226106:20:21:72:540:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluation system.  The managed professional development was similar to the Success for All treatment
74:2328:226207:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:described in Borman et al.  (2007).  The frequent feedback was similar to the quasi-experimental program
74:2329:226311:20:20:72:234:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evaluated in Taylor and Tyler (2012).
74:2330:226348:20:21:88:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To enhance student-level differentiation, all fourth, sixth and ninth graders received high-dosage math
74:2331:226451:21:20:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tutoring and extra reading or math instruction was provided to students in other grades who had previously
74:2332:226557:20:20:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performed below grade level. Similar to the Chicago BAM experiment described above, the tutoring model
74:2333:226659:20:21:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was adapted from the MATCH school in Boston – a charter school that largely adheres to the methods
74:2334:226757:21:20:72:239:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:described in Dobbie and Fryer (2013).
74:2335:226794:20:20:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In order to help teachers use interim data on student performance to guide and inform instructional prac-
74:2336:226899:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tice, schools were required to administer interim assessments every three to four weeks and provided with
74:2337:227004:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:three cumulative benchmark assessments, as well as assistance in analyzing and presenting student perfor-
74:2338:227109:20:0:72:540:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mance data on these assessments.  Yet, as Rockoff et al.  (2012) and Dobbie and Fryer (2013) demonstrate,
75:2339:227216:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data alone is not enough.  Dobbie and Fryer (2013) argue that the use of interim assessment data is only
75:2340:227320:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlated with achievement for schools who can articulate a precise plan of how they will change student
75:2341:227425:21:20:72:371:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grouping or pedagogy or some other strategy in response to the data.
75:2342:227493:20:20:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, to instill a culture of high expectations and college access, we started by setting clear expecta-
75:2343:227600:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tions for school leadership. Schools were provided with a rubric for the school and classroom environment
75:2344:227705:21:20:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and were expected to implement school-parent-student contracts.  Specific student performance goals were
75:2345:227809:20:20:72:540:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:set for each school and the principal was held accountable and provided with financial incentives based on
75:2346:227915:20:21:72:123:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these goals.
75:2347:227927:21:20:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Such invasive changes were possible,  in part,  because eleven of the twenty schools (nine secondary

75:2351:228347:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:alternative quasi-experimental specifications, we randomly selected nine additional elementary schools (vis-

75:2357:228983:20:20:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools is straightforward.   In the remaining set of schools,  we use three separate statistical approaches
75:2358:229091:20:20:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to understand the impact of the intervention.   Treatment is defined as being zoned to attend a treatment

75:2361:229410:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We begin by using district administrative data on student demographics and,  most importantly,  previous
75:2362:229514:20:21:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years’ achievement, to fit least squares models. We then present two empirical models that instrument for a

75:2367:230032:20:20:72:539:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement.  Students in treatment elementary schools gain around 0.184σin math per year, relative to
75:2368:230134:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comparison samples.  Taken at face value, this is enough to eliminate the racial achievement gap in math
75:2369:230238:21:20:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Houston elementary schools in approximately three years. Students in treatment secondary schools gain

76:2381:231370:21:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomized trials. Answering this question is, by definition, speculative – as it relies on extrapolations from
76:2382:231481:20:20:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cross-sectional relationships and assumptions on how human capital propagates through an individual’s life.
76:2383:231588:20:21:72:449:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Still, the exercise may be informative and we include it here as an illustrative exercise.

77:2402:233555:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Genome Model (SGM).33The SGM is a useful tool to simulate how shocks in a given life-stage may carry
77:2403:233655:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over to later life outcomes. For example, one can simulate how much increasing reading test scores in early

77:2406:233967:20:21:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we simply implement best practices. Winship and Owen (2013) provide evidence that the SGM reasonably

77:2410:234295:28:20:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The model draws from the vast literature of human capital formation and assumes that cognitive and non-

77:2412:234510:21:20:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vious stages of life.  Specifically, Winship and Owen (2013) define six different life-stages:  circumstances
77:2413:234619:20:20:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at birth (CAB), early childhood (EC), middle childhood (MC), adolescence (AD), transition to adulthood

77:2425:235393:28:14:84:539:121:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:33Due to there being no source code available – even upon request – and limited description in the SGM guide, we constructed
77:2426:235517:14:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:the model using our own assumptions about the cleaning, creation, and merging of the data. This leads to a final dataset used for the

78:2439:236626:28:20:71:539:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Unfortunately, as discussed by Winship and Owen (2013), there is not yet a reliable dataset that follows

78:2444:237139:21:20:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the specific variables that were used for each life-stage. The variables include a mix of cognitive skills (e.g.
78:2445:237251:20:20:71:539:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standardized test scores), non-cognitive skills (e.g. self esteem and hyperactivity indices), and important life
78:2446:237363:20:21:71:299:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes (e.g. teen birth, drug use, and graduation).
78:2447:237416:21:20:88:539:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using  these  two  datasets  and  the  equations  above,  we  are  able  to  estimate  the  coefficients  for  each

78:2449:237639:20:21:71:539:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Due to the age of respondents at first interview in the NLSY79, the data from earlier life stages is not as
78:2450:237746:21:20:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rich as in the CNLSY. Therefore, the NLSY79 does not contain all of the CAB, EC, MC, and AD variables
78:2451:237847:20:20:71:540:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the CNLSY has. In order to overcome this, we define a set of linking variables,LINK, that contains all
78:2452:237954:20:21:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes that are available in both the NLSY79 and the CNLSY. We can then estimate the following two
78:2453:238054:21:34:71:451:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equations in the NLSY79 dataset to obtain coefficients for each TTA and AH outcome:

78:2456:238225:31:20:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using all of the coefficients generated from these estimations and the CNLSY data, we can then build
78:2457:238325:20:0:71:539:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a  synthetic  baseline  dataset  of  birth  to  age  40  outcomes  for  the  CNLSY  sample.   Given  the  impact  of
79:2458:238443:0:20:72:540:711:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an intervention at some life-stage,  we can then use the same coefficients to propagate the effects of the
79:2459:238549:20:21:72:540:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention through the life-stages of these individuals.  Comparing a post-intervention estimation of an
79:2460:238655:21:20:72:540:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcome  to  the  baseline  estimation  would  then  provide  us  with  an  estimated  impact  of  the  intervention
79:2461:238771:20:20:72:540:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the given outcome.   See Winship and Owen (2013) and our Online Appendix B for a more in depth

79:2464:238942:27:21:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As mentioned,  our simulations are,  at best,  illustrative.   Relying on cross-sectional correlations,  making
79:2465:239053:21:20:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important (untestable) assumptions on the law of motion of human capital development, and assuming that
79:2466:239156:20:20:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the variation induced by experiments would largely be consistent across groups and time are necessary for
79:2467:239261:20:21:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our exercise. If, as Cunha and Heckman (2010) argue, “skills beget skills and abilities beget abilities” these
79:2468:239371:21:20:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assumptions are overly restrictive and will bias our estimates downward.   If on the other hand,  as many
79:2469:239476:20:20:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economists might find natural, there are diminishing marginal returns to interventions, then the forthcoming
79:2470:239584:20:21:72:172:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates are too large.
79:2471:239608:21:20:88:539:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If public policy were to implement the most successful math and reading interventions when children
79:2472:239707:20:20:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:are in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, the expected test score increase would be 1.192σ
79:2473:239814:20:21:72:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in math and 2.449σin reading.34  35Using the model, the math impact would translate into a 8.28% increase
79:2474:239919:21:20:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in income at age 40 and the reading impact would translate into a 25.06% increase.36Table 4 presents the
79:2475:240023:20:20:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average successful impact for each category-life-stage and the estimated impact on income at age 40 if only
79:2476:240130:20:20:72:288:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an intervention with that effect was implemented.
79:2477:240179:20:21:88:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Whether or not the cumulative impact is enough to eliminate racial wage inequality depends on one’s
79:2478:240278:21:20:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ability to “tag” (in the sense of Akerlof 1978) minorities among other things. We won’t hazard a quantitative
79:2479:240387:20:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:guess,  but  qualitatively  it  seems  clear  that  adhering  to  the  best  practices  gleaned  from  the  literature  on
79:2480:240509:20:21:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:randomized field trials discussed in this chapter would significantly reduce, if not eliminate, much of the
79:2481:240616:21:33:72:455:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gap between racial groups in wages and other important economic and social outcomes.
79:2482:240700:33:14:84:539:187:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:34For the time being, there are no RCTs that estimate effects on children’s math and reading abilities during the circumstances
79:2483:240827:14:11:72:540:173:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:at birth life-stage.  Potential studies that focused on infants that our search returned were mostly excluded from our meta-analysis
79:2484:240959:11:8:72:262:162:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:for not using standardized math or reading measures.
79:2485:241011:8:14:84:539:154:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:35As  to  not  give  too  much  weight  in  this  exercise  to  any  one  study,  we  approximate  the  impact  of  the  “most  successful”
79:2486:241150:14:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:intervention for each life-stage as the average of the three largest statistically significant impacts from each category. If there were
79:2487:241286:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:no significant studies for a given category-life-stage,  we assign an impact of zero.   The cumulative impacts stated are the sum
79:2488:241415:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of the five averages from the category-life-stages – early childhood, home (middle childhood), school (middle childhood), home
79:2489:241541:11:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(adolescence), and school (adolescence).  This simple approximation assumes impacts are linearly additive one-time shocks and
79:2490:241666:11:8:72:189:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:experiments are externally valid.
79:2491:241699:8:14:84:539:88:7:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f8:F:36Using the cross-sectional estimates generated by Chetty et al.  (2014), the expected income gain at age 28 from a 1.192σ
79:2492:241821:14:0:72:492:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:increase in standardized math scores is 15.62% and from a 2.449σincrease in standardized reading scores is 32.08%.
80:2493:241937:0:32:72:162:711:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5    Conclusion
80:2494:241952:32:20:72:540:679:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The review of 196 randomized field experiments designed to increase human capital production unearthed
80:2495:242054:20:20:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:several facts. Early childhood investments, on average, significantly increase achievement. Yet, experiments
80:2496:242162:20:21:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that attempt to alter the home environment in which children are reared in have shown very little success at
80:2497:242270:21:20:72:540:618:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing student achievement.  Among school experiments, high-dosage tutoring and ‘managed’ profes-
80:2498:242371:20:20:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sional development for teachers have shown to be effective. Ironically, high-dosage tutoring of adolescents
80:2499:242478:20:21:72:540:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:seems to be as effective – if not more effective – than early childhood investments.  This argues against
80:2500:242583:21:20:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the growing view that there is a point at which investments in youth are unlikely to yield significant re-
80:2501:242689:20:20:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:turns (Carniero and Heckman 2003; Cullen et al. 2013). Lastly, charter schools can be effective avenues of
80:2502:242795:20:21:72:540:517:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:achievement-increasing reform, though the evidence on other market-based approaches such as vouchers or
80:2503:242898:21:20:72:273:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:school choice have less demonstrated success.
80:2504:242943:20:20:88:539:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These facts provide reason for optimism.  Through the systematic implementation of randomized field
80:2505:243042:20:21:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiments designed to increase human capital of school-aged children, we have substantially increased
80:2506:243145:21:20:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our knowledge of how to produce human capital and have assembled a canon of best practices.  And, in an
80:2507:243248:20:20:72:540:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:illustrative simulation exercise, we demonstrate that focusing on what we know has the potential to increase
80:2508:243356:20:20:72:255:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:income and reduce racial wage inequality.
80:2509:243397:20:21:88:539:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The question is:  do we have the courage to implement, at scale, human capital policies based on best
80:2510:243498:21:43:72:322:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:practices developed from these randomized experiments?
