2:25:1110:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:In the past two decades China leaped from bit player in global science and engineering (S&E) to become
2:26:1212:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the world's largest source of S&E graduates and the second largest spender on R&D and second largest
2:27:1312:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:producer of scientific papers. As a latecomer to modern science and engineering, China trailed the
2:28:1410:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:US and other advanced countries in the quality of its universities and research but was improving both
2:29:1512:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:through the mid-2010s. This paper presents evidence that China's leap benefited greatly from the country's
2:30:1618:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:positive response to global opportunities to educate many of its best and brightest overseas and from
2:31:1719:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the deep educational and research links it developed with the US. The findings suggest that global
2:32:1817:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:mobility of people and ideas allowed China to reach the scientific and technological frontier much

3:46:2141:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) devastated science and engineering education and research 
3:47:2235:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in China. It led to the closing of China's national entrance exam that had for hundreds of years been 
3:48:2337:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  pathway  for  students  to  enter  colleges  and  universities.  Universities  admitted  no  new 
3:49:2439:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:undergraduate students from 1966 through 1969 and admitted no new graduate students through 
3:50:2531:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1977. In 1970 China had only 47,000 undergraduate students and essentially no graduate students 
3:51:2627:23:24:72:543:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Li,  2010,  Table  8.1).  Recovering  from  the  Cultural  Revolution  in  the  1970s  and  1980s 
3:52:2726:24:23:72:543:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollments  in  four-year  programs  increased  to  2.1  million  in  1990  (Li,  Table  8.2)  while 
3:53:2828:23:24:72:543:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollments in all programs, including more vocationally oriented less than bachelor's programs, 
3:54:2925:24:23:72:543:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reached 3.8 million (Table 1). Still, China's share of world enrollments of 5.6% fell short its 
3:55:3021:23:23:72:542:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-fifth  (31%)  of  the  world's  1990  population.1 With  few  S&E  graduates,  China  had  fewer 
3:56:3122:23:24:72:543:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research scientists and engineers than did some countries with a tenth of China's population while 
3:57:3221:24:23:72:543:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China-based  researchers  contributed  fewer  papers  to  international  science  journals  than 
3:58:3318:23:27:72:288:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China-born researchers outside the country.2 
3:59:3362:27:24:72:543:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The  great  leap  forward  in  science  and  engineering  that  gives  this  essay  its  title  was 
3:60:3466:24:23:72:543:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated in the two decades of the 1990s and 2000s. In this short span of time China leaped 
3:61:3562:23:24:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from bit player in global science and engineering to become the world's largest source of S&E 
3:62:3656:24:23:72:543:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:graduates, second largest spender on R&D and second largest producer of scientific papers, in both 
3:63:3755:23:23:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases behind the US. The number of patents in China increased so rapidly as to make China the 
3:64:3849:23:33:72:542:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number one country in patents (WIPO, 2014).3 The number of China addresses on USPTO patents

3:67:4113:21:13:72:113:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:for China 
3:68:4123:13:22:72:542:205:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:2 Some scholars argue that the parts of Chinese science that fit with the goals of the government fared reasonably well 
3:69:4243:22:17:72:542:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:during the Maoist period (Wei and Brock 2012) but there is no gainsaying that the drops in admission to undergraduate 
3:70:4361:17:17:72:541:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and graduate S&E programs, banishment of professors and other researchers o the rural parts of the country, absence 
3:71:4477:17:13:72:351:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of scientific papers wrecked the bulk of China's research community. 
3:72:4546:13:22:72:542:136:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:3 Incentives linking pay to number of patents have produced a patent system with many short single claim patents that 
3:73:4664:22:17:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:are not readily comparable to patents in the US, EU, and Japan. That China is number one in WIPO patent data does 
3:74:4778:17:17:72:542:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:not mean that it is top of the world in patenting. The number of China addresses on US, EU, and Japanese patents has 
3:75:4895:17:0:72:316:80:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:risen but place China far from the top countries in patenting. 
4:76:4960:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased enough to move China from a negligible producer of US patents to 7th among non-US 
4:77:5052:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries with US patents. As a latecomer to modern science and engineering, China trailed the US 
4:78:5150:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and other advanced countries in the quality of its universities and research but was improving both

4:80:5273:27:23:72:543:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    This  paper  analyzes  China's  great  leap  forward  in  science  and  engineering.  It  presents 
4:81:5376:23:24:72:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence  that  China's  leap  benefited  greatly  from  the  country's  positive  response  to  global 
4:82:5480:24:23:72:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:opportunities to educate many of its best and brightest overseas and from the deep educational and 
4:83:5579:23:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research links it developed with the US. China first permitted students to self-finance overseas 
4:84:5676:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study and for scientific specialists to undertake cross-country research, then awarded fellowships

4:86:5877:23:24:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:universities to hire faculty from abroad and to undertake international research collaborations, and 
4:87:5978:24:23:72:542:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sought multinational transfers of knowledge.4 Global mobility of people and ideas allowed China 
4:88:6074:23:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reach the scientific and technological frontier much faster than if it had gone down a more 
4:89:6169:23:28:72:146:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parochial path. 
4:90:6185:28:23:72:543:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:     The  paper  has  three  parts.  Section  one  examines  the  increase  in  domestic  university 
4:91:6286:23:24:72:543:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enrollments  and  in  students  studying  overseas  that  turned  China  into  the  number  one  source 
4:92:6390:24:23:72:543:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country  for  scientists  and  engineers  worldwide.  Section  two  documents  the  growth  of  R&D 
4:93:6490:23:23:72:543:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending, production of scientific papers, and international research collaborations that improved 
4:94:6589:23:24:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quality of Chinese science. Section three makes the case that the close links that developed 
4:95:6686:24:23:72:543:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between China and the US in education and research constitute a “special relationship” that augurs 
4:96:6785:23:28:72:328:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:well for research in both countries and in the world.

5:118:8599:24:23:72:543:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new colleges and universities, expansion of existing institutions, and the upgrading lower level

5:122:8999:23:24:72:543:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country to raise the proportion of students admitted to college after taking the national entrance

5:126:9351:27:34:72:543:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    Table 2 shows that the huge expansion of enrollments produced a commensurately large

5:129:9610:17:18:72:374:119:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:6 The absolute increase was from 3.8 million in 1990 to 30 million in 2010

6:135:10032:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:might suggest that China suffered from high university drop out during its enrollment spurt. With 
6:136:10130:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:4-5 years normally spent to earn a bachelor's degree, 30 million enrollments could be expected to 
6:137:10228:23:24:72:543:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:produce ~ 6-7 million graduates.9 But the divergence reflects something very different: the fact 
6:138:10325:24:23:72:543:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that nearly half of enrolled students take 2-3 year degree programs with greater occupational 
6:139:10419:23:27:72:397:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:training and less academic content than traditional baccalaureates.

6:142:10608:23:24:72:543:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased more rapidly than bachelor's degrees. Master's degrees increased nearly fifteen-fold

7:164:12679:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    All of these developments reflected both the policies of the Chinese government to expand 
7:165:12773:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher  education  and  the  desire  of  young  Chinese  students  to  invest  in  additional  years  of 
7:166:12878:23:27:72:492:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:schooling, in part due to the high returns to education in China's new market economy. 
7:167:12965:27:24:72:543:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    There are three caveats to China's leap forward in world higher education. First, the huge 
7:168:13060:24:23:72:543:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number  of  enrollments  and  degrees  results  from  China's  large  population  more  than  from 
7:169:13159:23:24:72:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exceptionally high rates of college-going relative to the population. With a population roughly 
7:170:13255:24:23:72:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four  times  that  of  the  US,  China  would  have  as  many  students/graduates  as  the  US  with  a 
7:171:13359:23:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students/graduates to population ratio about one-fourth that of the US.12 Given China's large rural 
7:172:13459:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:population and relatively low quality education for persons with rural hukou, the country would 
7:173:13555:24:23:72:543:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have to invest substantially in elementary and secondary school to raise the proportion of young 
7:174:13652:23:28:72:340:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:persons in tertiary education much beyond 2010 levels. 
7:175:13707:28:23:72:543:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The second caveat is that the quality of China's college and university system lags behind that 
7:176:13807:23:23:72:543:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of higher educational systems in the US and other advanced countries. Table 3 demonstrates this

7:182:14343:7:22:72:523:291:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:12 Taking a broader age group, the OECD estimates that the 2010 ratio of persons who attained at least a tertiary 
7:183:14457:22:17:72:543:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:education to persons aged 25-34 was 8% in China compared to 42% in the US, 38% for the OECD average, and world 
7:184:14568:17:17:72:537:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:high of 65% for Korea (OECD, 2012, Chart A1.1). The China figures are for persons 25-34. As the OECD does not 
7:185:14678:17:17:72:533:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:make clear the relevant age group it has chosen, the above comparison is based on the assumption that the relevant 
7:186:14793:17:18:72:542:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:group is the number of persons at a single age between 25 and 34, assuming a flat distribution of persons within the age 
7:187:14914:18:17:72:542:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:category. The figures reported in the Scorecard (2012) for China are a decimal point off. At the PhD level, the ratio of 
7:188:15035:17:17:72:531:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:graduates to persons in the relevant age group was about 0.25% for China (STI Performance of China, Annex p 4) 
7:189:15146:17:13:72:410:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:compared to 1.6% for the US and 1.5% for the OECD (OECD, 2011, figure 2.1.1).

8:212:17335:24:23:72:543:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Education asked the central government to send more students aboard, but the numbers were 
8:213:17425:23:24:72:543:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minuscule – barely 2,000 students in the five years 1978-1982, of whom 16% were graduate 
8:214:17514:24:23:72:542:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students and 9% undergraduate students, with the vast majority being visiting researchers. The 
8:215:17609:23:23:72:543:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government selected students for overseas study on the basis of its goals rather than the career 
8:216:17706:23:20:72:543:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plans of students.16 Few Chinese had the funds to self-finance study abroad and those that did

8:223:18364:21:0:72:436:80:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:emphasized the main channel of the students to go abroad is to be sent by the government. 
9:224:18456:0:28:72:360:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needed administrative department approval of their studies. 
9:225:18516:28:23:72:543:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The flow of Chinese international students increased in the 1980s, with the US the favored 
9:226:18611:23:23:72:543:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:destination. The Chinese government maintained the policy of allowing international students and 
9:227:18708:23:24:72:543:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:researchers to study outside the country even after the 1989 Tiananmen incident, which led many 
9:228:18804:24:23:72:543:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overseas students to seek permanent immigrant status in the US.17 This loss of talent would almost 
9:229:18903:23:24:72:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:surely have caused many countries to stop the flow of students overseas but China went in the 
9:230:18997:24:23:72:542:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other direction.18 In 1993 the Communist Party Central Committee endorsed overseas education 
9:231:19090:23:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the slogan “Support going, Encourage Back, Go and Back Free”19 The number of Chinese 
9:232:19180:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studying overseas increased moderately through 2000, then accelerated as the State Board of 
9:233:19272:24:23:72:542:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Education simplified procedures for self-financed students to study abroad.20 In 2005 the Ministry 
9:234:19371:23:24:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Education announced that it would “select the highest talent student in China and send them 
9:235:19466:24:23:72:543:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abroad to the best universities/institutes and follow the best advisers”. In 2007 it joined with the 
9:236:19567:23:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ministry of Finance to set up the “national high-level university researchers program” to subsidize 
9:237:19667:23:28:72:266:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more students and visiting researchers.

9:239:19805:23:24:72:543:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:late 1990s through 2014, with a break after 2001 due to the US State Department rejecting more 
9:240:19900:24:23:72:543:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:visa applicants than in the past and making it difficult for international students to travel outside

9:242:20060:7:22:72:542:291:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:17 The US, in particular, offered Chinese students an opportunity to remain in the country, first through administrative 
9:243:20181:22:17:72:519:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:decree and then in 2002 with the Chinese Student Protection Act that targeted permanent residence for Chinese 
9:244:20291:17:17:72:509:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:students in the United States. An estimated 54,000 persons gained green cards and presumptively citizenship 
9:245:20399:17:13:72:115:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:thereafter. 
9:246:20411:13:22:72:528:222:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:18 We can only speculate on the possible reasons the government continued its international student policies. One 
9:247:20525:22:17:72:513:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:likely reason the government was so favorable to top Chinese students studying overseas was recognition that 
9:248:20634:17:17:72:542:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:necessary for them to reach their potential as scholars, consistent with China's historic cultural respect for scholarship. 
9:249:20758:17:17:72:541:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Another likely reason was the need for up-to-date scientific and technological expertise available only from overseas 
9:250:20876:17:18:72:532:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:experts. And government also likely to be influenced by the desire of top officials and wealthy business persons to 
9:251:20992:18:12:72:284:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:give their children best education world has to offer.

10:255:21343:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the USA – all in response to the 9/11 terrorist destruction of the World Trade Center. The increased 
10:256:21444:24:23:72:542:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flow of Chinese students to Australia in the early 2000s suggests that some Chinese students went 
10:257:21542:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  Australia  instead  of  the  US.  In  2005/06  the  number  of  Chinese  students  going  to  the  US 
10:258:21648:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased  massively  as  the  State  Department  reformed  the  student  visa  program  (National 
10:259:21747:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Academy of Sciences 2005). This change in policy may have reduced the number of Chinese 
10:260:21835:23:28:72:302:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students going to Australia shown in the Table.

10:265:22209:23:24:72:543:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wanted the talent coming back “to innovate and register new companies that served the nation”. Li

11:285:23897:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:security numbers of foreign-born students shows that 86% of Chinese PhD graduates of 2006

11:287:24088:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:further that the rate at which Chinese PhDs stay in the US drops by about 2 percentage points a

11:302:25434:24:23:72:543:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information flows exceeds the loss of supply due to international students remaining in the US and

12:312:26148:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:later, China's research spending surpassed that of all of the major R&D spending countries save for 
12:313:26248:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the US (Figure 2). While China spent less than the EU on R&D, the ratio of RD/GDP in China 
12:314:26339:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jumped from 0.76 in 1999 to 1.84 in 2011, nearly the same ratio as the EU. Extrapolating the trends 
12:315:26439:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in R&D spending of China, the EU, and the US in 2014, the OECD expected that China would 
12:316:26528:23:28:72:437:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:surpass the EU in total R&D in 2014-2015 and to surpass the US in 2019.24

12:319:26723:23:24:72:543:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:education, and increase in R&D spending set the stage for a huge increase in the key measurable 
12:320:26819:24:27:72:462:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outputs from scientific research, academic papers and citations to those papers.25 
12:321:26901:27:23:93:543:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panel A of Table 5 shows the quantity of scientific papers in the US, Japan, Germany, UK and 
12:322:26994:23:24:72:542:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China in 1990, 2000, and 2012. China jumped from being a minor producer of papers to become a 
12:323:27088:24:23:72:543:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:major producer between 1990 and 2012. Its share of world papers tripled from 3.3% in 2000 to 
12:324:27181:23:24:72:543:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:13.7% in 2012. The contrast of China's rising position in the production of papers with Japan's 
12:325:27277:24:23:72:543:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:declining position is striking. In 2000 China had one-third as many papers as Japan. In 2010 China 
12:326:27376:23:27:72:250:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:had twice as many papers as Japan.

12:328:27438:28:23:93:543:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A: What about the quality of Chinese science? The most widely used metric for measuring the 
12:329:27527:23:23:72:543:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality of scientific output is the citations that a paper garners. Because citations are influenced by 
12:330:27631:23:24:72:543:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the social norms of citations in different fields and by the network links among scientists as well as 
12:331:27734:24:21:72:543:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the “innate quality” of the science itself, citations are an imperfect measure of the scientific

12:335:28013:13:22:72:538:153:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:25 In China as in other countries, the vast majority of papers have UNIV or COLL in their addresses while few have 
12:336:28128:22:17:72:539:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:addresses of firms. Tabulating addresses in China we found that 70.1% are universities, (which defines as the names 
12:337:28244:17:17:72:531:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:include “UNIV” or “COLL”; while 23.3% are institutes (which defines as the names include “INST” or “ACAD”, 
12:338:28351:17:17:72:536:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:usually for Chinese Academy of Sciences, or of Social Sciences. Therefore, in China, over 93% of the papers are in 
12:339:28466:17:0:72:307:80:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Universities or institutes (the above two has little overlap) 
13:340:28531:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of a paper (Adler et al. 2008). Because scientists in a given area are more likely to cite 
13:341:28635:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:papers written by persons in the same locale, papers with a country address from a major science 
13:342:28732:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:producing country such as the US will generally receive more citations than papers from countries 
13:343:28830:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with smaller scientific communities even if the papers are comparable in their scientific content.26 
13:344:28930:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These problems notwithstanding, citations remain the most widely used indicator of the scientific 
13:345:29028:23:24:72:543:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of a paper. A paper cited by more scientists has greater value than one of comparable 
13:346:29127:24:27:72:235:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality cited by fewer scientists.  
13:347:29163:27:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  To examine the position of China in citations, panel B of Table 5 records the share of the top 1% 
13:348:29263:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cited papers with addresses for China and other leading producers of scientific papers. The Table 
13:349:29361:24:23:72:546:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also reports the ratio of China's share of the top 1% of cited papers divided by its share of all papers. 
13:350:29467:23:24:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This ratio exceeds 1 when a country has a higher share of the top 1% papers than of all papers and 
13:351:29566:24:23:72:543:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:falls short of 1 in the opposite situation. It is a rough indicator of the average quality of papers. By 
13:352:29671:23:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these metrics, China lags behind the lead countries in the quality of its scientific output. In 2002 
13:353:29772:23:24:72:543:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China had a negligible absolute share and modest relative share of the top 1% of papers. However, 
13:354:29870:24:23:72:543:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both statistics increase through 2012 with China moving ahead of Japan in its share of top 1% 
13:355:29964:23:24:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:papers. Still, China fell far short of reach the position in top cited papers of the US and EU. It is 
13:356:30066:24:27:72:439:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:easier to leap forward in the quantity than in the quality of research activity.

13:359:30286:24:23:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidenced by a continuous upward trend in the number of authors per paper (Wuchty, Jones and 
13:360:30379:23:23:72:543:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Uzzi,  2007;  Adams,  Black,  Clemmons,  and  Stephan,  2005).  Scientific  research  has  also

13:362:30570:24:27:72:529:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries trending upwards even more rapidly (National Science Board, 2014; Adams, 2013).  
13:363:30661:27:24:72:543:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    While the number of authors per paper increased in China as in other countries, Table 6 shows 
13:364:30759:24:23:72:542:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that China diverged from the trend in increased internationalization of papers. The ratio of articles

14:370:31268:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because the massive growth of researchers in China made it relatively easy for Chinese scientists 
14:371:31366:24:27:72:272:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to find co-authors in their own country.28

14:377:31823:24:23:72:543:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:biggest  collaborator  by  far.  In  2012  the  US  accounted  for  47.5%  of  China's  international

14:385:32386:27:23:72:543:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    To see how international collaborations affect the quality of China's scientific papers, we have

14:391:32971:22:17:72:543:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:because the tabulations count an international paper with co-authors from two countries as a single paper at the world

14:393:33177:13:22:72:524:136:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:28 The same pattern is observed in Korea, which has also zoomed forward in researchers, research spending, and

14:396:33429:21:0:72:229:80:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Association of Science Editors (2007).

15:399:33659:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Kerr's name-ethnicity matching program (Kerr 2008, Kerr and Lincoln 2010), which assigns an

15:401:33848:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hinges on the fact that last names such as Zhang are likely to be Chinese, names like Johnson likely 
15:402:33949:23:28:72:422:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be Anglo-American, names like Singh likely to be Indian, and so on.

15:415:35060:27:24:72:543:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The columns “Non-China-based papers with Chinese-named authors” record the estimated 
15:416:35149:24:23:72:543:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relation between having first or last Chinese names on the impact factor of the journal in which a 
15:417:35248:23:23:72:542:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper appeared and 5-year forward citations for papers with all addresses in the US, and thus relate 
15:418:35349:23:24:72:543:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the research contribution of Chinese researchers usually working in advanced countries. The 
15:419:35444:24:23:72:543:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:surname  ethnicities  are  divided into four categories:  Anglo-Saxon, Chinese, Other  Asian and 
15:420:35541:23:28:72:543:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Other Non-Anglo-Saxon. The reference group is Anglo-Saxon authors and the coefficients on 
15:421:35631:28:7:216:218:126:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
15:422:35689:7:22:72:519:119:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:30 The Program divides ethnicity into nine categories: Chinese (CHN), Anglo-Saxon/English (ENG), European 
15:423:35795:22:17:72:532:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:(EUR), Indian/Hindi/South Asian (HIN), Hispanic/Filipino (HIS), Japanese (JAP), Korean (KOR), Russian (RUS) 
15:424:35903:17:0:72:174:80:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and Vietnamese (VNM). 
16:425:35928:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Other Asian and Other Non-Anglo-Saxon are not reported. The coefficients on Chinese-named 
16:426:36018:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:authors  are  positive  for  both  first  and  last  authors  in  both  the  citation  and  the  impact  factor 
16:427:36130:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regressions, indicating that those papers gain greater attention and are more likely to be published 
16:428:36231:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in high impact journals than papers with Chinese researchers. One likely reason for this is positive 
16:429:36332:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selectivity of Chinese researchers working in the US and other overseas destinations. Chinese 
16:430:36426:23:24:72:543:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:international students and visiting researchers to the US and elsewhere are often the best and 
16:431:36521:24:23:72:543:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:brightest from China while the non-Chinese researchers to which the regression compares them 
16:432:36614:23:24:72:543:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include persons with a wider range of research skills. Note, however, that the coefficients on 
16:433:36709:24:23:72:542:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chinese named last authors are positive but have a smaller magnitude, especially for impact factor. 
16:434:36809:23:23:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since last authors are often the senior authors who have the connections or reputation to best place 
16:435:36910:23:24:72:543:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a paper in more prestigious journals, the smaller effect on impact factors may come from the older 
16:436:37009:24:27:72:450:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generation of Chinese researchers having weak connections in placing papers. 
16:437:37086:27:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    The columns “Overseas Experience of Chinese Authors on China-based papers” distinguish 
16:438:37177:23:24:72:543:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chinese authors working in China by whether or not they had published a prior paper based on 
16:439:37270:24:23:72:543:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overseas research, which we define as a paper with no address in China. This definition assures us 
16:440:37369:23:24:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the researcher worked outside of China on the earlier paper. It is a conservative estimate of 
16:441:37468:24:23:72:543:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outside  China  research  and  publication  experience,  since  a  China  located  author  could  have 
16:442:37571:23:23:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:worked outside China with someone in China, and thus have outside China research experience 
16:443:37663:23:24:72:543:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  we  would  not  capture.  This  measurement  error  should  downward  bias  our  estimated 
16:444:37760:24:23:72:543:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients on the overseas experience variable. Even so, the regressions show that past overseas 
16:445:37859:23:24:72:543:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:publication experience in the US (defined as a paper with all addresses in the US) or elsewhere 
16:446:37955:24:23:72:543:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(other papers with no China addresses) in by China-based authors are associated with higher 
16:447:38047:23:23:72:543:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact factors and citations. We report the coefficients on the English language dummy to show 
16:448:38142:23:24:72:543:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the huge value of publishing in an English language journal, which invariably have higher impact 
16:449:38239:24:27:72:393:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factors than other journals, and are associated with more citations. 
16:450:38308:27:24:72:543:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    One likely reason for the estimated positive coefficients on the overseas experience variables 
16:451:38407:24:0:72:543:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that the Chinese researchers learned valuable skills from international experience, ranging from 
17:452:38510:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:better research techniques to gaining insight into the latest scientific ideas, which often depend on 
17:453:38612:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tacit knowledge from the leading researchers who developed them. Another likely reason is that 
17:454:38707:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:working  overseas  created  connections  that  increase  the  likelihood  that  international  journals 
17:455:38811:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accept someone's papers and of generating citations from overseas researchers. It is also possible 
17:456:38910:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the positive effect of overseas experience may reflect positive selection of researchers who 
17:457:39008:23:28:72:281:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:published papers while working overseas.  
17:458:39050:28:23:72:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    Finally,  the  columns  “Overseas  Collaboration  on  China-addressed  papers”  examines  the 
17:459:39148:23:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relation between papers based on collaborations of China-based scientists with scientists in the US 
17:460:39248:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or in other countries and the impact factors and forward citations to their papers. The sample for 
17:461:39347:24:23:72:543:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these calculations is limited to papers in Pub Med with at least one address in China. Since papers 
17:462:39447:23:24:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:written in China have on average lower impact factors and citations than those written in the US 
17:463:39544:24:23:72:543:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and other major research producing locations, we expect that collaborations between researchers 
17:464:39640:23:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  China  and  researchers  in  advanced  countries  raises  the  impact  factor  and  citations  of 
17:465:39742:23:24:72:543:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collaborative papers relative to papers written solely in China. The estimated coefficients confirm 
17:466:39842:24:23:72:543:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this expectation. The regressions also show that collaborating with US-based scientists has larger 
17:467:39941:23:24:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive effects on impact factors and citations than does collaborating with scientists in other 
17:468:40039:24:23:72:543:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries. This result fits with the fact that US-based papers average higher impact factors and 
17:469:40136:23:23:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:citations than papers from most other countries. The estimates in the last line “China-US & other 
17:470:40234:23:24:72:543:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collaboration” shows that papers with US and other country collaborations have the largest impact 
17:471:40332:24:23:72:543:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factors and citations. The scientific input that goes into multi-country papers is often greater than 
17:472:40434:23:24:72:543:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that of smaller collaborations, in part due to use of special equipment such as huge telescopes or 
17:473:40533:24:23:72:543:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:special research facilities like the CERN Hadron collider or to large clinical trials. A paper with 
17:474:40633:23:23:72:543:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:authors from many counties is also likely to gain greater attention by tapping into networks of 
17:475:40729:23:28:72:218:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:researchers in more countries. 
17:476:40759:28:27:72:144:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:3. Conclusion 
17:477:40772:27:23:72:543:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    China's leap forward in science and engineering in the 1990s and 2000s is one of the defining 
17:478:40870:23:0:72:543:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:events  in  modern  intellectual  history  and  as  important  to  the  future  of  the  world  as  China's 
18:479:40981:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extraordinary economic growth. With hundreds of thousands of Chinese researchers contributing 
18:480:41075:24:23:72:543:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the advance of scientific knowledge, and millions of Chinese engineers and scientists working 
18:481:41172:23:24:72:543:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to apply modern scientific technology to the production of goods and services, the frontier of 
18:482:41267:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:useful knowledge will almost surely advance more rapidly than if China had remained a scientific 
18:483:41364:23:27:72:132:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:backwater.  
18:484:41376:27:24:72:543:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    Our analysis has shown that this achievement was achieved not only by China's decision to 
18:485:41470:24:23:72:543:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rebuild itself from the disaster of the Cultural Revolution and Mao's “great leap forward” in the 
18:486:41568:23:23:72:543:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1960s but also by China's  accessing the global higher education and research system,  and in 
18:487:41662:23:24:72:543:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular through a “special relation” in education and research with the United States, the world's 
18:488:41764:24:23:72:543:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:leading  scientific  power  (Freeman  and  Huang,  2014).  The  special  relation  took  the  form  of 
18:489:41867:23:24:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:international student flows, where the US is the main destination of China's overseas students, and 
18:490:41967:24:23:72:543:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:China is the single largest source of international students in the US; the high rate at which Chinese 
18:491:42070:23:23:72:543:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:PhDs from US universities remain in the US and together with immigrant scientists and engineers, 
18:492:42167:23:24:72:543:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constitute a sizable share of researchers with US addresses; to each country being the major partner 
18:493:42268:24:23:72:543:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the other in international collaborations on scientific papers; and to the higher impact factor of 
18:494:42370:23:24:72:543:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:journals of publication and numbers of citations of papers with Chinese addresses from US and 
18:495:42464:24:23:72:543:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other foreign collaborations. There is much more that can be done in exploring the special relation 
18:496:42564:23:23:72:543:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between China and the US and China's education and research link to other countries, as well.

18:498:42752:24:23:72:543:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students and/or among students in the same university or laboratory; the extent to which persons of 
18:499:42852:23:24:72:543:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chinese  ethnicity  in  the  US  (or  other  foreign  addresses)  disproportionately  collaborate  with 
18:500:42956:24:23:72:543:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:researchers in China, and whether any such pattern holds for persons of other ethnicity (which we 
18:501:43054:23:23:72:543:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would expect to be the case); and the contribution of Chinese government support for international 
18:502:43153:23:24:72:543:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students and research visits on scientific outcomes are natural follow-ups of the findings in this 
18:503:43252:24:23:72:543:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper. More broadly, all of our results regarding the relation between the US and China could be 
18:504:43349:23:28:72:296:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fruitfully expanded to include other countries. 
18:505:43397:28:0:72:543:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:    Ideally, the China -US collaboration in education of scientists and engineers and in research 
19:506:43498:0:24:72:543:704:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will spur the development and spread of knowledge in ways that benefit not only the Chinese and 
19:507:43594:24:23:72:542:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:American  people  but  people  around  the  world  and  that  strengthens  the  cooperative  relations 
19:508:43697:23:24:72:547:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the two countries. Globalization of knowledge may not be the “one ring that rules them all” 
19:509:43797:24:23:72:543:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that Freeman (2014) hypothesized but it is surely a necessary ring for the world to overcome its 
19:510:43894:23:23:72:543:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:problems and to improve lives everywhere. We look forward to China's increasing contribution to 
19:511:43990:23:28:72:543:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the global world of knowledge production. In research perhaps more than anywhere else, the 
19:512:44080:28:32:72:546:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:emerging China needs the world and the world needs an emerging China. 崛起的中国需要世界，
