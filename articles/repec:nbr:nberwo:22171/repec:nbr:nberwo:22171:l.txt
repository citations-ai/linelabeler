2:28:1306:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Physicians,  acting  in  their  role  as  experts,  are  often  faced  with  situations  where  they  must  trade 
2:29:1420:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:off personal  and  patient  welfare.  Physicians’  incentives  vary  based  on  the  organizational 
2:30:1519:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:environment in which they practice. We use the publication of a major clinical trial, which found 
2:31:1616:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:that  a  common knee  operation  does  not  improve  outcomes  for  patients  with  osteoarthritis,  as  an 
2:32:1723:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:“informational  shock” to  gauge  the  impact  of  physicians’  agency  relationships  on  treatment 
2:33:1823:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:decisions.  Using  a  100%  sample of  procedures  in  Florida  from  1998  to  2010,  we  find  that 
2:34:1924:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:publication of the trial reduced procedure volume, but the magnitude of the decline was smaller 
2:35:2019:14:42:71:504:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:in physician-owned surgery centers. Incentives affected physicians’ reactions to evidence.

3:58:2563:0:21:72:157:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:I. INTRODUCTION 
3:59:2577:21:21:108:111:688:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
3:60:2577:21:20:108:518:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Vertical integration between physicians and others types of health care providers can 
3:61:2663:20:21:72:536:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:facilitate care coordination but, under the prevailing fee-for-service reimbursement regime, may 
3:62:2760:21:21:72:494:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:present physicians with incentives to refer patients for costly care. Physician ownership 
3:63:2850:21:20:71:520:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:arrangements are of special concern. Historically physicians owned the offices in which they 
3:64:2943:20:21:72:535:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided primary care and basic exams but maintained arms-length relat ionships wit h hospitals, 
3:65:3040:21:21:71:517:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:imaging centers, surgery centers, and other facilities. Beginning in the 1990s and continuing 
3:66:3134:21:21:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:throughout the 2000s, many physicians assumed ownership stakes in non-office facilities. Based 
3:67:3229:21:20:72:533:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:on concerns that ownership encourages physicians to recommend high cost, low value services, 
3:68:3322:20:21:72:529:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:the US Department of Health and Human Services restricts physician ownership of health care 
3:69:3414:21:21:72:527:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:facilities. Some types of physician ownership arrangements are prohibited outright. Others are 
3:70:3509:21:20:72:433:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:permitted as long as they adhere to a number of regulatory “safe harbors”.  
3:71:3584:20:21:108:480:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:Research on physician ownership of surgery centers (Hollenbeck et al. 2010; 
3:72:3660:21:21:72:525:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hollingsworth et al. 2010a; 2010b; 2011; Mitchell 2010), cardiac hospitals (Barro et al. 2006; 
3:73:3755:21:20:72:539:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mitchell 2005; 2008, Nallamothu et al. 2007), imaging centers (Baker 2010; Shreibati and Baker 
3:74:3850:20:21:72:525:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:2012) and pharmacy services (Iizuka 2007; 2012) has generally confirmed the hypothesis that 
3:75:3942:21:21:72:533:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership is associated with increased use of health care services. A limitation of most of these 
3:76:4040:21:21:72:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies is that, in the absence of a benchmark for the optimal level of use, it is impossible to 
3:77:4137:21:20:72:506:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:assess the impact of alternative practice arrangements on consumer welfare. Physicians in 
3:78:4227:20:21:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:physician-owned facilities provide more care, but we do not know if they provide too much. 
3:79:4317:21:21:107:531:274:144:Times:144:Times:A:In 2002 the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a trial (hereafter, 
3:80:4406:21:20:71:514:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:the “Moseley trial”) showing that arthroscopic surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the 
3:81:4501:20:21:71:523:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:knee, a widely used procedure at the time, does not improve pat ient outcomes (Moseley et al. 
3:82:4595:21:21:71:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002). Physicians perform arthroscopic surgery in hospital-based surgery centers or freestanding 
3:83:4692:21:20:71:517:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:centers, most of which are physician-owned. We use the trial as an “informational shock” to 
3:84:4784:20:21:71:516:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:compare physicians’ treatment decisions in hospital-based and physician-owned ambulatory 
3:85:4873:21:21:71:527:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgery centers. We find that the Moseley trial affected practice patterns, but the magnitude of 
3:86:4970:21:21:71:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the effect was smaller in freestanding centers. The Moseley trial identified a clinical scenario 
3:87:5067:21:0:71:524:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:where physicians’ financial interests and the interests of their patients diverge. Faced with the 
4:88:5167:0:21:72:501:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:same set of scientific facts, physicians in hospital-based and freestanding surgery centers 
4:89:5259:21:21:71:186:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:responded different ly.

4:91:5285:20:21:71:339:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:II. PHYSICIAN OWNERSHIP AND TREATMENT INCENTIVES 
4:92:5332:21:21:72:75:626:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:93:5332:21:20:108:530:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:For every surgery, insurers pay a professional services fee to the surgeon for their labor 
4:94:5423:20:21:72:501:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:and a facility fee (or “technical” fee) to the hospital or surgery center to cover the cost of 
4:95:5518:21:21:72:516:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:supplies, non-physician labor, and capital. Physician-owners split the profits generated from 
4:96:5612:21:21:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:facility fees based on their ownership shares, providing an extra incentive to induce demand.1 (It 
4:97:5711:21:20:71:527:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be illegal under federal anti-kickback laws for a facility to pay a physician based on the 
4:98:5808:20:21:71:513:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:profits generated from directly from his own surgeries.) Physician-owned facilities can also 
4:99:5901:21:21:71:536:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentivize physicians by tying ownership shares to productivity. Reallocating ownership shares 
4:100:5997:21:20:71:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:on a predetermined schedule based on each owner’s procedure volume is illegal. However, 
4:101:6085:20:21:71:530:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:reallocating shares during times of transition – when owners bring in a new partner or when an 
4:102:6180:21:21:71:483:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:existing partner retires – is legal as long as shares are exchanged at fair market value. 
4:103:6269:21:20:108:522:398:144:Times:144:Times:A:Managers in physician-owned facilities may be better than managers in other types of 
4:104:6354:20:21:72:504:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:facilities at eliciting high levels of physician effort (and inducement). Hospitals are large, 
4:105:6449:21:21:72:502:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:bureaucratic, multi-product firms. The residual claimants (e.g., shareholders, non-clinical 
4:106:6541:21:21:72:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:administrators) are far-removed from the delivery of care. By contrast, groups of surgeon-owners 
4:107:6638:21:20:71:533:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:face stronger incentives to monitor each others’ case volumes, face lower monitoring costs, and 
4:108:6734:20:21:71:428:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:have greater ability to reward high-volume surgeons and punish shirkers.

4:110:6808:21:20:71:207:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:III. CLINICAL BACKGROUND 
4:111:6831:20:21:72:75:233:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:112:6831:21:21:108:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure to treat damage to the soft tissue 
4:113:6921:21:20:72:521:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the knee. A patient undergoing arthroscopic surgery receives several small incisions in the 
4:114:7016:20:21:72:513:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:knee. The surgeon inserts a camera (the arthroscope) to inspect the bone, cartilage, and soft 
4:115:7110:21:21:72:498:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:tissue in the joint. After validating the initial diagnosis, the surgeon may perform lavage 
4:116:7202:21:29:72:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:(irrigation of the joint to remove particles that cause inflammation), debridement (to remove 
4:117:7295:29:8:72:218:100:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:F:                                                             
4:118:7355:8:18:72:498:92:48:Times:122:Times:F:1 Income effects may offset the direct incentives presented by ownership. If ownership increases 
4:119:7452:18:0:72:524:74:122:Times:122:Times:F:physicians’ income, they may reduce labor supply and/or efforts to induce demand (McGuire 2000).    
5:120:7553:0:21:72:530:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:damaged tissue), and/or a menisectomy (to remove damaged meniscal tissue). In 2002 the New 
5:121:7644:21:21:72:532:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:England Journal of Medicine published a trial evaluating arthroscopic surgery for patients with 
5:122:7740:21:20:72:532:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:osteoarthrit is (Moseley et al. 2002). Patients in the control arm were anestisized and underwent 
5:123:7838:20:21:72:492:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:sham surgery. The trial found that patients did not benefit from surgery. There were no 
5:124:7926:21:21:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences in pain and functioning between the treatment arms. Because the trial was published 
5:125:8022:21:20:72:502:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:in one of the most prominent medical journals, resulted in the publication of a number of 
5:126:8112:20:21:72:503:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:commentaries in other journals, and was covered in the popular press (e.g., Kolata 2002), 
5:127:8202:21:21:72:423:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge of the trial among physicians should have been widespread.   
5:128:8273:21:21:108:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:Some orthopedic surgeons questioned the external generalizability of the Moseley trial, 
5:129:8361:21:20:72:519:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:as is typical following the release of trials that challenge established practices. Medicare and 
5:130:8458:20:21:72:531:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:major private insurers accepted the findings and withdrew coverage of arthroscopic surgery for 
5:131:8553:21:21:72:530:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (CMS 2003; 2004; Aetna 2003). As we describe 
5:132:8646:21:20:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:in section X, it is difficult for insurers to enforce non-coverage policies because insurance claims 
5:133:8747:20:21:72:497:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:for knee arthroscopy do not report whether surgery is being performed primarily to treat 
5:134:8836:21:21:72:497:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:osteoarthritis or other types of knee problems. While this feature complicates the task of

5:136:9028:20:21:72:518:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:they treat patients presenting with knee pain. Since 2002, two additional trials (Kirkley et al. 
5:137:9125:21:21:71:418:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008; Katz et al. 2013) have confirmed the finding of the Moseley trial.

5:141:9232:21:21:108:509:274:144:Times:144:Times:A:We hypothesize that surgeons practicing in freestanding centers, who face stronger 
5:142:9315:21:20:72:531:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial incentives to perform surgery, were less likely to stop performing knee arthroscopy in 
5:143:9412:20:21:72:531:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients with osteoarthrit is co mpared to surgeons in hospital-based centers. Prior to publication 
5:144:9512:21:21:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Moseley trial, surgeons could have reasonably believed that all patients with osteoarthritis 
5:145:9612:21:20:72:511:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the knee would benefit from knee arthroscopy. There was no conflict between physician 
5:146:9701:20:21:72:535:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:welfare and physicians’ perceptions of patient welfare. After publication, physicians’ incentives 
5:147:9799:21:21:72:538:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:and patients’ interests diverged. Physicians who recommended knee arthroscopy to patients with 
5:148:9894:21:21:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:osteoarthritis were “inducing” demand by encouraging patients to consume unnecessary services

6:153:10044:21:20:108:518:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:We measured trends in arthroscopic knee surgery volume among patients age 18 and 
6:154:10125:20:21:72:533:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:older using Florida’s State Ambulatory Surgery Database for the period 1998 to 2010. The data 
6:155:10219:21:21:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:capture 100% of outpatient surgeries in Florida and include the information typically found on 
6:156:10314:21:20:72:535:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance claims, including basic patient demographics and diagnosis and procedure codes. The 
6:157:10408:20:21:72:490:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:data are collected by the state’s Agency for Health Care Administration. We identified 
6:158:10495:21:21:72:528:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedures using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases 
6:159:10588:21:21:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:version 9 (ICD-9) codes (see the appendix for a list of codes). The data include an identifier for 
6:160:10687:21:20:72:530:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the facility where the surgery was performed and whether the facility was a hospital-based or a 
6:161:10783:20:21:72:269:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:freestanding ambulatory surgery center.  
6:162:10823:21:21:108:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:Osteoarthritis is inconsistently and infrequently recorded as a diagnosis on claims, and so 
6:163:10915:21:20:72:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:we do not limit the sample to patients with osteoarthritis. Instead, claims typically include codes 
6:164:11015:20:21:72:521:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:for “Internal derangement of knee” (ICD-9 code 717.X). We analyze facility-level procedure 
6:165:11106:21:21:72:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:vo lumes that reflect the use of surgery in patients with osteoarthritis and patients with other types 
6:166:11209:21:20:72:164:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:of knee problems.  
6:167:11228:20:21:108:503:378:144:Times:144:Times:A:We identified 522,635 arthroscopic knee surgeries, of which 233,321 (44%) were 
6:168:11307:21:21:72:540:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:performed in freestanding centers. Patients treated in freestanding centers were slightly older (52 
6:169:11407:21:21:72:514:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:versus 50) than patients treated in hospital-based centers. The distribution of insurance type 
6:170:11502:21:20:72:322:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:(60% male, about 20% Medicare) was very similar.

6:174:11604:20:21:108:514:233:144:Times:144:Times:A:We compare changes in the volume of arthroscopic knee surgeries between hospital-
6:175:11685:21:21:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:based and freestanding surgery centers following publication of the Moseley trial. As with many 
6:176:11781:21:20:72:523:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous studies of physician ownership (e.g., Hollingsworth et al. 2010a; Mitchell 2005), we 
6:177:11875:20:21:72:536:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:only observe patients who received surgery. We do not observe patients who were evaluated for 
6:178:11969:21:21:72:501:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:but did not receive arthroscopic surgery. Comparisons of surgery volume trends between 
6:179:12055:21:21:72:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based and freestanding centers may be biased by secular trends in patient demand.  
6:180:12147:21:20:108:532:108:144:Times:144:Times:A:Our main identification strategy is to evaluate trends in the volume of arthroscopic knee 
6:181:12237:20:0:72:505:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgeries relative to trends in the volume of arthroscopic shoulder surgeries. Arthroscopic 
7:182:12331:0:21:72:492:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:shoulder surgery shares many of the characteristics of arthroscopic knee surgery: it is a 
7:183:12421:21:21:72:527:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimally invasive, outpatient surgery used to treat a variety of conditions, including arthritis. 
7:184:12520:21:20:72:509:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:All of the centers in our sample performed arthroscopic shoulder procedures in addition to 
7:185:12611:20:21:72:508:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopic knee surgery. The intuition behind our approach is that the secular trends that 
7:186:12704:21:21:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected the demand for knee surgery over the study period – e.g., the growth of the freestanding 
7:187:12802:21:20:72:510:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgery center industry, changes in local population demographics – should be captured by 
7:188:12892:20:21:72:503:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends in the volume of arthroscopic shoulder procedures. Under a fairly innocuous set of 
7:189:12982:21:21:72:513:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumptions, we can identify the number of knee surgeries that would have been avoided if 
7:190:13072:21:21:72:500:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:physicians in freestanding centers behaved like physicians in hospital-based centers post-
7:191:13162:21:20:71:122:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moseley.  
7:192:13172:20:21:107:534:502:144:Times:144:Times:A:A simple model is useful for formalizing this argument and the identifying assumptions. 
7:193:13260:21:21:71:481:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:For the sake of simplicity, assume there is a single hospital-based center and a single 
7:194:13348:21:24:71:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:freestanding center. Let Htkrepresent the number of knee surgeries in the hospital-based center in 
7:195:13447:24:24:72:511:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:period t (1 or 2, corresponding to pre-  and post-Mosely periods). Let HtK represent patient 
7:196:13539:24:22:72:529:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand in the hospital-based center (i.e., the number of patients with knee problems evaluated 
7:197:13634:22:24:72:516:390:144:Times:144:Times:B:for surgery). Let Hts and HtS represent the volume and demand for shoulder surgeries in the 
7:198:13726:24:28:72:520:366:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based center. The quantities for the freestanding center are defined analogously (Ftk,
7:199:13821:28:21:83:537:338:48:Times:144:Times:A:FtK ,Fts ,FtS). The treatment rate is the number of patients who received surgery divided by the 
7:200:13918:21:21:72:513:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:number evaluated for surgery. The treatment rate for patients with knee pain in the hospital-

8:310:15322:14:7:72:355:141:48:Times:122:Times:F:2 The equality holds if we apply assumptions 1 and 2 (substitute 
8:311:15387:7:14:418:523:134:58:Times:122:Times:F:HtHHHtKsδα= and FtFFFtKsδα=), 
8:312:15417:14:10:71:368:120:122:Times:122:Times:F:cancel out the HHδα’s and FFδα’s, and then apply assumption 3. 
8:313:15479:10:9:72:381:110:48:Times:122:Times:F:3 The claim also holds under an alternative version of the assumption: 
8:314:15550:9:15:434:508:101:40:Times:122:Times:F:111HHSK=δ, 111FFSK=δ, 
8:315:15572:15:12:131:522:86:43:Times:122:Times:F:222HHSK=δ, and 222FFSK=δ. In this version, the relationship between the demand for knee and 
8:316:15664:12:0:72:400:74:122:Times:122:Times:F:shoulder procedures is allowed to vary over time but not across providers. 
9:317:15740:0:21:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:B: Assumption 1 would be violated if the number of patients experiencing knee problems 
9:318:15824:21:21:72:531:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased at a different rate than the number of patients experiencing shoulder problems. Using 
9:319:15920:21:20:71:498:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 2002 and 2008 National Health Interview Surveys, nationally-representative surveys 
9:320:16007:20:21:71:492:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducted by the US Department of Health and Human Services, we estimated that the 
9:321:16090:21:21:71:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:proportion of adults who experienced “pain, aching, stiffness or swelling” in or around one of 
9:322:16185:21:20:71:527:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:their knee joints in the past 30 days increased from 16.4% (16.0% to 17.0%) in 2002 to 19.0% 
9:323:16278:20:21:71:517:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:(95% CI: 18.3% to 19.7%) in 2008. The comparable figures for the shoulder jo ints are 8.6% 
9:324:16369:21:21:72:519:564:144:Times:204:g_d0_f6:B:(95% CI: 8.2% to 9.1%) and 9.3% (95% CI: 8.8% to 9.8%).4 These imply that the value of δ
9:325:16457:21:21:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the ratio of shoulder to knee patients) was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.58) in 2002 and 0.49 (0.42 to 
9:326:16556:21:21:72:534:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.56) in 2008. The difference is qualitatively small and statistically insignificant, supporting the 
9:327:16657:21:20:72:202:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:validity of the assumption. 
9:328:16684:20:21:108:516:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:Assumption 2 would be violated if the criteria for determining whether patients with 
9:329:16769:21:21:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:shoulder problems are good candidates for surgery changed over time. There were no major 
9:330:16858:21:20:72:532:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in evidence about the effectiveness of shoulder surgery over the period covered by our 
9:331:16953:20:21:72:541:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:study. Reflecting the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of shoulder arthroscopy, the American 
9:332:17051:21:21:72:532:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons stated in its 2010 treatment guideline for osteoarthritis of the 
9:333:17147:21:21:72:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:shoulder (Izquierdo et al. 2010), “We are unable to recommend for or against the use of 
9:334:17235:21:20:72:440:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopic treatments for patients with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis.”  
9:335:17314:20:21:108:486:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:Based on our review of the medical literature, we believe it is unlikely that the 
9:336:17396:21:21:72:531:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:publication of the Moseley trial affected physicians’ beliefs about the effectiveness of shoulder 
9:337:17494:21:20:72:533:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopy. Only two of the 599 articles that have cited the Moseley trial according to the New 
9:338:17591:20:21:72:533:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:England Journal of Medicine website were on the subject of shoulder arthroscopy ( Beard et al. 
9:339:17686:21:21:71:536:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:2015; Judge et al. 2014). Both cited the Moseley trial as an example of the type of trial (placebo-
9:340:17785:21:21:71:523:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlled) that should be conducted on shoulder surgery, not as a trial that provides evidence 
9:341:17881:21:20:71:500:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:about shoulder surgery. Neither the systematic review on the effectiveness of surgery for 
9:342:17971:20:21:71:531:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:shoulder osteoarthritis conducted by the well-respected Cochrane group (Singh et al. 2011) nor

9:344:18162:20:37:71:337:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Surgeons (Izquierdo et al. 2010) cite the Moseley trial.

9:346:18278:8:18:72:516:105:48:Times:122:Times:F:4 Respondents self-reported shoulder and knee problems. Estimates are weighted and standard errors 
9:347:18377:18:13:72:503:87:122:Times:122:Times:F:adjusted for the complex survey design. We used Monte Carlo simulation to calculate confidence 
9:348:18472:13:0:72:158:74:122:Times:122:Times:F:intervals for ratios. 
10:349:18496:0:21:108:529:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Conceivably, surgeons who reduced the number of knee surgeries they performed after 
10:350:18580:21:21:72:516:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the publication of the Moseley trial may have performed more shoulder surgeries, making it 
10:351:18671:21:20:72:510:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:difficult to interpret changes in the ratio of knee to shoulder surgeries over time. However, 
10:352:18765:20:21:72:534:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:orthopedic surgeons could offset decreases in the volume of knee surgeries by performing other 
10:353:18860:21:21:72:489:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:types of orthopedic surgeries (e.g., hip replacements), not just shoulder surgeries. Any 
10:354:18949:21:20:72:506:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:substitution between knee and shoulder surgeries is probably a small, second-order effect. 
10:355:19039:20:21:108:518:585:144:Times:144:Times:A:Assumption 3 would be violated if patients with knee pain were treated differently at 
10:356:19125:21:21:72:512:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based and freestanding centers prior to the publication of the Moseley trial. Before 
10:357:19219:21:21:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002, several small randomized trials of debridement (Merchan et al. 1993) and lavage (Ike et al. 
10:358:19317:21:20:72:512:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:1992) found that these therapies reduced knee pain. Knee arthroscopy was a well-accepted, 
10:359:19407:20:21:72:502:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:established therapy for osteoarthritis, and orthopedic surgeons in both hospital-based and 
10:360:19498:21:21:72:521:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:freestanding centers could have reasonably believed that their interests were aligned with the 
10:361:19593:21:20:72:338:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:interests of their patients (Chandra and Skinner 2012).

10:366:19768:21:21:72:537:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:and, separately, in the 161 hospital-based and 70 freestanding centers that operated continuously 
10:367:19866:21:21:71:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:between 1998 and 2010 and performed an average of 20 knee arthroscopies annually. These 
10:368:19954:21:20:71:523:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:facilities accounted for 73 percent of the arthroscopic knee surgeries in Florida over the study 
10:369:20051:20:21:71:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:period. Many freestanding surgery centers opened in Florida between 1998 and 2010 and are 
10:370:20141:21:21:71:536:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:thus excluded. The figure indicates the date of publication of the Moseley and Kirkley trials and 
10:371:20239:21:20:71:501:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:the release of the CMS Decision Memo (2003) indicating that Medicare would withdraw 
10:372:20323:20:21:71:441:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage of arthroscopic surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.  
10:373:20403:21:21:107:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Annual arthroscopic surgery volume in Florida increased from 41 thousand procedures in 
10:374:20490:21:20:71:498:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:1998 to 63 thousand in 2007 before declining to 59 thousand in 2010. The prevalence of 
10:375:20577:20:21:71:538:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was increasing over this period (Nguyen et al. 2011). There was 
10:376:20672:21:21:71:526:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:a sharp decline in volume in hospital-based centers following publication of the Moseley trial. 
10:377:20768:21:21:71:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Most of the post-Moseley decline in procedure volume preceded changes in insurers’ coverage 
10:378:20860:21:0:71:118:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies.  
11:379:20873:0:21:108:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 1 displays annual procedure counts for surgeons who performed at least 20 knee 
11:380:20958:21:21:72:530:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopies annually. Over the period 1998 to 2001, there were 301 surgeons who performed 
11:381:21050:21:20:72:527:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:most of their procedures at hospitals. Surgeons in freestanding centers performed over 92% of 
11:382:21144:20:21:72:541:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:their surgeries at their most frequently used freestanding center. The vast majorit y (>95%) would 
11:383:21243:21:21:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:be classified as owners using the criteria employed by Hollingsworth et al. (2010a) to distinguish 
11:384:21342:21:20:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:between owners and non-owners. The data include surgeon identifiers, but these cannot be linked 
11:385:21438:20:21:72:328:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time, hence our focus on facility-level analyses. 
11:386:21492:21:21:108:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure 2 shows trends in facility-level procedure volumes. Average volume grew rapidly 
11:387:21579:21:21:71:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:in freestanding centers prior to the publication of the Moseley trial, particularly in 1998 and 
11:388:21675:21:20:71:517:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999. Some or many of the freestanding centers in the sample may have opened just prior to 
11:389:21766:20:21:71:532:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:1998, and so the trends in volume probably reflect the volume growth typical for new entrants.  
11:390:21862:21:21:107:531:481:144:Times:144:Times:A:The left panel of Figure 2 shows trends in quarterly, facility-level arthroscopic shoulder 
11:391:21953:21:20:71:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgery volumes. Procedure volume did not decline following publicat ion of the Moseley trial, 
11:392:22048:20:21:71:532:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with the idea that the Moseley trial did not affect physicians’ or patients’ perceptions 
11:393:22148:21:21:71:242:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the benefits of shoulder surgery.

11:403:22645:21:21:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedures. We drew 1,000 bootstrap samples, with sampling at the level of the surgery center, 
11:404:22740:21:20:72:532:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals. Average volume decreased in hospital-based 
11:405:22835:20:21:72:540:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:centers and increased in freestanding centers. The difference-in-difference estimate of the impact 
11:406:22934:21:21:72:498:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the Moseley trial on quarterly knee arthroscopy volume is -16.9 [95% CI: -27.6, -6.3]

12:422:24040:21:21:72:528:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:that may be problematic in our case. It assumes that, in the absence of an effect, the difference-
12:423:24138:21:20:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:in-difference estimator for shoulder surgery would be of the same magnitude as the difference-
12:424:24232:20:21:72:486:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:in-difference estimator for knee surgery. This assumption seems inconsistent with the 
12:425:24318:21:21:72:538:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:observation that the number of knee surgeries is greater than the number of shoulder surgeries at 
12:426:24416:21:20:72:530:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:any point in time. Trends in knee and shoulder surgery volumes operate on different scales and 
12:427:24511:20:21:72:537:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:from much different baseline levels. As an alternative to the standard difference-in-difference-in-

13:465:26243:22:23:72:526:472:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based centers post-Moseley (e.g.,  22HHsk).  The parameters 4β and 5β are defined 
13:466:26333:23:22:72:449:449:144:Times:144:Times:B:analogously for freestanding centers. The difference-in-difference estimator is

13:468:26435:24:21:108:539:403:144:Times:144:Times:A:We estimated the model via least squares. Quarterly arthroscopic knee surgery procedure 
13:469:26523:21:20:72:521:382:144:Times:144:Times:B:counts are skewed, but counts of shoulder surgery procedures are also skewed and correlated 
13:470:26615:20:21:72:536:362:144:Times:144:Times:B:with knee surgery procedure counts. The skew in the residual from the regression is much lower 
13:471:26710:21:21:72:531:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the skew in the raw procedure counts and the distribution is bell-shaped, though a Shapiro-
13:472:26806:21:21:72:516:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:Wilk test rejects the null that the residual is normally distributed (p < 0.001). In the baseline 
13:473:26904:21:24:72:515:299:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification we treat iμ as a random effect. We do not require fixed effects for purposes of 
13:474:26998:24:21:72:531:275:144:Times:144:Times:B:identification because provider type is a time-invariant clinic characteristic. Standard errors are

14:484:27844:21:20:71:344:664:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence on practice patterns in hospital-based centers.  
14:485:27903:20:21:107:530:644:144:Times:144:Times:A:Using the estimated parameters, we constructed the right-hand side of equation [3]. We 
14:486:27990:21:21:71:494:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate that freestanding centers would have performed 3,000 fewer arthroscopic knee 
14:487:28076:21:20:71:517:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedures annually (95% confidence interval: 2,133 to 3,866) over the period 2003 to 2007

14:489:28259:21:21:71:403:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:centers was the same as the treatment rate in hospital-based centers.

14:491:28418:21:21:72:535:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation [6]. Model 1 is the baseline model. Model 2 omits the hospital indicator. Models 3 and 
14:492:28514:21:24:72:538:498:144:Times:144:Times:B:4 treat iμ as a fixed effect. Model 4 weights the regressions by pre-2002 surgery volume. Model 
14:493:28610:24:21:72:527:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:5 includes all facilities, including those that entered after 1998.  Model 6 omits 1998 and 1999 
14:494:28707:21:21:72:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the analysis. Model 7 omits 2009 and 2010, where procedure volume was subject to the 
14:495:28797:21:20:72:300:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence of the Kirkley trial and the recession. 
14:496:28846:20:21:108:538:412:144:Times:144:Times:A:Models 8-10 examine procedure counts within age groups. These results indicate that the 
14:497:28934:21:21:72:505:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:baseline estimate is not driven by differences in the age composition of patients treated in 
14:498:29027:21:21:72:520:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based versus freestanding centers.  Overall, the results show that the estimate of θ is 
14:499:29124:21:21:72:297:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:insensitive to alternative model specifications. 
14:500:29172:21:20:72:539:328:144:Times:144:Times:B: Models 11 and 12 stratify the analysis by insurance type: private versus other. About half 
14:501:29263:20:21:71:533:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:of patients in the other category have Medicare, and about one-third have Medicaid. The results 
14:502:29359:21:21:71:483:287:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicate that after the Moseley trial, freestanding centers were more likely to perform 
14:503:29447:21:20:71:535:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopy in privately insured patients than hospital-based centers. However, practice patterns 
14:504:29545:20:21:71:527:246:144:Times:144:Times:B:were similar for patients with other types of insurance. One explanation is that physicians face 
14:505:29642:21:21:71:535:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:stronger incentives to induce demand for privately-insured patients because private insurers pay

15:516:30049:21:20:108:486:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:There are two broad categories of arthroscopic knee surgery: debridement and 
15:517:30126:20:21:72:476:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:menisectomy. Examining trends by procedure type provides an additional source of 
15:518:30207:21:21:72:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:identification. Insurers’ costs of monitoring appropriateness are much lower for debridement 
15:519:30300:21:20:72:541:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to menisectomy. Thus, we expect that physicians would focus their inducement efforts 
15:520:30394:20:21:72:156:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:on menisectomy. 
15:521:30410:21:21:108:501:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:Figure 4 depicts a stylized treatment pathway for patients with knee pain who are 
15:522:30492:21:21:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:evaluated for arthroscopic surgery. Consider a patient with knee pain where the surgeon suspects 
15:523:30589:21:20:72:537:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the pain is due to arthritis (A). The surgeon recommends that the patient undergo an arthroscopy 
15:524:30686:20:21:72:522:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:(B). During surgery, the physician determines if the patient has damaged meniscal tissue (C). 
15:525:30780:21:21:72:470:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:The mensci are cartilaginous disks that cushion the knee joint. If so, he performs a 
15:526:30865:21:20:72:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:“meniscectomy” to remove torn tissue (E). Otherwise, he performs a debridement procedure (D). 
15:527:30959:20:21:72:504:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:A meniscectomy was performed on 81 percent of the patients randomized to arthroscopic 
15:528:31045:21:21:72:206:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgery in the Kirkley trial. 
15:529:31074:21:20:108:540:398:144:Times:144:Times:A:Now consider a patient where the surgeon suspects pain is caused by a torn meniscus (F). 
15:530:31163:20:21:72:529:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:Typically, the surgeon will order a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) (G) to confirm the 
15:531:31256:21:21:72:503:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:results of the physical examination. If the MRI shows a torn meniscus (H), he performs a 
15:532:31345:21:21:72:160:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:menisectomy (E). 
15:533:31361:21:20:72:482:315:144:Times:144:Times:B: Following arthroscopic surgery, the surgeon submits an insurance claim for a 
15:534:31438:20:21:72:491:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:debridement procedure or a menisectomy. Post-Moseley, insurers scrutinize claims for 
15:535:31523:21:21:72:525:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:debridement procedures closely. However, when an insurer receives a bill for a menisectomy, 
15:536:31615:21:20:72:541:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is no information on the claim that permits the insurer to determine whether the patient was 
15:537:31714:20:21:72:508:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:originally treated for osteoarthritis (pathway A-B-C-E), in which case the procedure is not 
15:538:31806:21:21:72:308:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:covered, or a torn meniscus (pathway F-G-H-E). 
15:539:31852:21:20:108:496:191:144:Times:144:Times:A:Some insurers require documentation that the patient has a torn meniscus before 
15:540:31932:20:21:72:539:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:authorizing payment for arthroscopic surgery. Surgeons may order an MRI (G) for a patient who 
15:541:32026:21:21:72:492:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:is a candidate for surgery (A) to document meniscal damage. Many older patients have 
15:542:32111:21:21:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:asymptomat ic meniscal tears (Englund et al. 2008). For this reason, surgeons are advised not to 
15:543:32207:21:20:72:519:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:rely exclusively on radiological evidence when deciding whether to perform a menisectomy. 
15:544:32297:20:0:72:523:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nevertheless, surgeons can use imaging studies to justify performing a menisectomy (E) on a 
16:545:32392:0:21:72:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:patient with arthritis. Based on the information included on insurance claims, insurers cannot 
16:546:32487:21:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:distinguish between treatment pathways A-G-H-E and F-G-H-E. They must pay the claim or risk 
16:547:32579:21:20:71:308:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:denying payment for medically appropriate care. 
16:548:32626:20:21:71:483:647:144:Times:144:Times:B: Figure 5 depicts trends in debridement procedures and menisectomies. Use of 
16:549:32702:21:21:71:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:debridement declined steeply following publication of the Moseley trial in both hospital-based 
16:550:32797:21:20:71:532:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:and freestanding centers. Use was declining in hospital-based centers prior to the Moseley trial. 
16:551:32895:20:21:71:500:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:The trendline for freestanding centers displays two notable trend breaks. The first occurs 
16:552:32986:21:21:71:528:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:immediately following publication of the Moseley trial. The second occurs after CMS issued a 
16:553:33079:21:21:71:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:decision memo stating its intent to discontinue coverage for arthroscopic surgery for patients 
16:554:33174:21:20:71:509:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:with severe osteoarthritis. It appears surgeons in freestanding centers reacted to changes in 
16:555:33268:20:21:71:520:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage policy. Use of meniscectomy declined following publication of the Moseley trial in 
16:556:33360:21:21:71:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based and freestanding centers. However, by 2004 procedure volume had rebounded to 
16:557:33452:21:20:71:284:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-Moseley levels in freestanding centers.  
16:558:33496:20:21:107:518:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:Model [B] in Table 3 re-estimates equation [7] for debridement procedures only. Pre-
16:559:33580:21:21:71:495:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moseley, hospital-based and freestanding centers performed 0.26 and 0.25 debridement 
16:560:33665:21:20:71:518:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedures per arthroscopic shoulder procedure, respectively. Post-Moseley, the comparable 
16:561:33756:20:22:71:537:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:figures are 0.05 and 0.06. The differential decline in hospital-based centers is insignificant (=θ 
16:562:33854:22:20:72:161:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:-0.029, p = 0.39).  
16:563:33873:20:21:107:520:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:Model [C] in Table 3 re-estimates equation [7] for menisectomies only. Pre-Moseley, 
16:564:33957:21:21:72:522:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital-based and freestanding centers performed 1.53 and 1.51 debridement procedures per 
16:565:34048:21:20:72:522:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:arthroscopic shoulder procedure. Post-Moseley, the comparable figures are 0.9 and 1.19. The 
16:566:34140:20:22:71:342:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:differential decline is significant (=θ - 0.31, p = 0.02).  
16:567:34199:22:20:107:506:252:144:Times:144:Times:A:The results are consistent with the hypothesis that surgeons in freestanding centers 
16:568:34284:20:21:71:514:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreased use of the procedure (debridement) where insurers’ monitoring costs are low, but 
16:569:34375:21:20:71:537:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:continued to perform the procedure (menisectomy) for which it is relatively difficult for insurers 
16:570:34474:20:21:72:257:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:to determine medical appropriateness.

16:572:34511:21:21:72:189:149:144:Times:144:Times:B:XI. THE KIRKLEY TRIAL 
16:573:34531:21:20:72:75:128:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
16:574:34531:20:21:108:513:108:144:Times:144:Times:A:In 2008 the New England Journal of Medicine published the results from a trial that 
16:575:34615:21:0:72:542:87:144:Times:144:Times:B:randomized patients with osteoarthritis to arthroscopic surgery plus physical and medical therapy 
17:576:34716:0:21:72:497:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:or physical and medical therapy alone (Kirkley et al. 2008). The Kirkley trial concluded 
17:577:34805:21:21:72:539:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:“surgery...provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.” Compared 
17:578:34900:21:20:72:515:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the Moseley trial, the Kirkley trial had broader enrollment criteria, including females and 
17:579:34995:20:21:72:495:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients with mild osteoarthritis, and procedures were performed by multiple surgeons.  
17:580:35083:21:21:108:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:The left panel of Figure 2 shows   that procedure volume declined around 2008, but the 
17:581:35170:21:20:72:515:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:size of the decline was larger in freestanding surgery centers. Model [D] in Table 3 tests the 
17:582:35265:20:21:72:534:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:impact of the Kirkley trial on center-level volume. We restrict the analysis to the period 2004 to 
17:583:35364:21:21:72:498:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010. We selected 2004 because it appears that results from the Moseley trial were fully 
17:584:35453:21:21:72:261:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:incorporated into practice by this time. 
17:585:35493:21:20:108:522:522:144:Times:144:Times:A:If surgeons fully adjusted practice patterns following publication of the Moseley trial, 
17:586:35582:20:21:72:498:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:then the 2008 Kirkley trial should have had no impact on practice patterns. If physicians 
17:587:35672:21:21:72:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:continued to recommend knee surgery for patients with osteoarthritis, then we would expect that 
17:588:35768:21:20:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedure volume would decline following publication of the Kirkley trial. The results indicate 
17:589:35864:20:21:72:533:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:that hospital-based centers performed 0.74 arthroscopic knee surgeries per shoulder surgery pre-
17:590:35960:21:21:72:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kirkley and 0.64 post-Kirkley. Freestanding centers performed 1.22 arthroscopic knee surgeries 
17:591:36055:21:21:72:532:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:per shoulder surgery pre-Kirkley and 1.0 post-Kirkley. The differential change is =θ0.11 (p = 
17:592:36149:21:21:72:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.116), indicating that there was a larger, though non-significant, relative decline in knee surgery 
17:593:36250:21:20:71:527:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:volume in freestanding centers. Results from the other specifications described in Figure 3 are 
17:594:36346:20:21:72:526:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar. Given the non-significance of the result, we cannot draw too much from this analysis. 
17:595:36441:21:21:72:530:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, the sign of  θ is consistent with the idea that, having induced demand at higher rates 
17:596:36537:21:21:72:526:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:following publication of the Moseley trial, surgeons in freestanding centers shifted toward the 
17:597:36633:21:21:72:536:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:more conservative practice patterns of their hospital-based peers.  Publication of the Kirkley trial 
17:598:36734:21:20:71:484:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:would have made it increasingly difficult for physicians to cling to their beliefs in the 
17:599:36824:20:21:71:527:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:effectiveness of surgery. Physicians who continued to recommend surgery would face an even 
17:600:36915:21:20:71:281:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher utility penalty for inducing demand. 
17:601:36958:20:21:71:74:191:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
17:602:36958:21:21:71:165:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:XII. CONCLUSIONS 
17:603:36973:21:21:108:111:149:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
17:604:36973:21:20:108:529:128:144:Times:144:Times:A:Publication of a trial that found that arthroscopic knee surgery does not benefit patients 
17:605:37064:20:21:72:531:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:with osteoarthritis affected practice patterns. However, the magnitude of the effect was smaller 
17:606:37161:21:0:72:525:87:144:Times:144:Times:B:in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, where surgeons face stronger incentives to induce 
18:607:37258:0:21:72:488:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand and greater peer monitoring of effort. In contrast to prior studies on physician 
18:608:37346:21:21:72:500:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership, we are able to tie differences in practice patterns to evidenced-based medical 
18:609:37436:21:20:72:123:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:practices.  
18:610:37447:20:21:108:533:647:144:Times:144:Times:A:Estimates of the impact of ownership on practice patterns must be interpreted in light of 
18:611:37537:21:21:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the fact that surgeons are not randomly assigned to work in hospital-based or physician-owned 
18:612:37631:21:20:72:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:surgery centers. P hysician-owned centers may differentially attract older doctors who are less 
18:613:37727:20:21:72:536:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to change practices in response to new evidence or “greedy” doctors, i.e., doctors who are 
18:614:37825:21:21:72:528:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:more willing to sacrifice patient welfare for their own financial gain. Some studies circumvent 
18:615:37921:21:21:72:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:this problem by examining how entry by physician-owned facilities affects market-level vo lume 
18:616:38016:21:20:72:515:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Barro et al. 2006; Hollenbeck et al. 2011; Hollingsworth et al. 2010b; 2011). These studies 
18:617:38109:20:21:72:510:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest that ownership has a casual impact on practice patterns. Market-level surgery rates 
18:618:38201:21:21:72:527:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase following entry and are higher in markets where physician-owned facilities perform a 
18:619:38295:21:20:72:210:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger share of procedures.7  
18:620:38325:20:21:108:523:440:144:Times:144:Times:A:Many medical procedures diffuse into clinical practice without having been subject to 
18:621:38411:21:21:72:532:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:rigorous testing. Clinical trials of established medical procedures can identify therapies that are 
18:622:38511:21:20:72:538:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:no better than less expensive alternatives. However, even well-done studies are open to differing 
18:623:38609:20:21:72:516:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretations. Our results indicate that the organizational environment in which physicians 
18:624:38703:21:20:72:305:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:practice affects how they react to new evidence.
