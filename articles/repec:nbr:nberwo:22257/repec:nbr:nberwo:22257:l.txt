2:42:2578:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We  propose  a  model  of  job  search  with  reference-dependent  preferences,  where  the  reference 
2:43:2681:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:point is given by recent income. Newly unemployed individuals search hard given that they are at 
2:44:2777:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:a  loss, but  over  time  they  get  used  to  lower  income,  and  thus  reduce  their  search  effort.  In 
2:45:2885:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:anticipation of a benefit cut their search effort rises again, then declines once they get used to the 
2:46:2987:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:lower benefit level. The model fits the typical pattern of the exit from unemployment, even with 
2:47:3083:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:no  unobserved  heterogeneity. The  model  also  makes  distinguishing  predictions  regarding  the 
2:48:3182:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:response  to  benefit  changes,  which we  evaluate  using  a  unique  reform.  In  2005,  Hungary 
2:49:3280:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:switched from a single-step UI system to a two-step system, with unchanged overall generosity. 
2:50:3374:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:The system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit 
2:51:3471:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:cuts  in  ways  the  standard  model  has  a  hard  time  explaining.  We estimate  a  model  with  optimal 
2:52:3578:14:14:72:542:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:consumption and endogenous search effort, as well as unobserved heterogeneity. The reference-
2:53:3670:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f2:F:dependent  model  fits  the  hazard  rates  substantially  better  than  most  versions  of  the  standard 
2:54:3776:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:model. We estimate a slow-adjusting reference point and substantial impatience, likely reflecting 
2:55:3874:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:F:present-bias. Habit  formation  and  a  variety  of  alternative  models  do  not  match  the  fit  of  the 
2:56:3981:14:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:reference-dependent model.  We  discuss  one  model  which  also  fits  well,  but  is  at  odds  with 
2:57:4083:14:37:72:250:378:12:Times:12:Times:C:calibrated values and other evidence.

3:91:4756:0:30:68:162:711:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:1  Introduction
3:92:4771:30:18:68:543:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Unemployment insurance programs in most Western countries follow a common design. The
3:93:4856:18:18:68:543:663:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits are set at a constant replacement rate for a fixed period, typically followed by lower
3:94:4951:18:18:68:543:645:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits under unemployment assistance. In such systems, the hazard rate from unemployment
3:95:5041:18:18:68:543:627:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:typically declines from an initial peak the longer workers are unemployed, surges at unemploy-
3:96:5135:18:18:68:543:609:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ment exhaustion, and declines thereafter. This has been shown in a variety of settings, such
3:97:5227:18:18:68:543:591:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as in the United States (Katz and Meyer, 1990), Hungary (Micklewright and Nagy, 1999),
3:98:5313:18:18:68:543:573:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Austria (Card et al., 2007a), Slovenia (van Ours and Vodopivec, 2008), Germany (Schmieder
3:99:5402:18:18:68:323:555:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:et al., 2012a), and France (Le Barbanchon, 2012).
3:100:5451:18:18:85:543:537:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:It is well-known that a basic job search model a la Mortensen (1986) and van den Berg
3:101:5536:18:17:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(1990) is unable to match this pattern.  This model predicts an increasing exit hazard up
3:102:5625:17:18:68:543:502:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:until benefit expiration, with a constant exit rate thereafter. To match the time path, job
3:103:5716:18:18:68:543:484:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:search models add unobserved heterogeneity among workers. More productive workers are
3:104:5801:18:18:68:543:466:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:more likely to find a job initially, leading to a decrease in the hazard over time as the workers
3:105:5898:18:18:68:392:448:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:still unemployed are predominantly of the less productive type.
3:106:5961:18:18:85:543:430:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In this paper, we propose, and test, a behavioral model of job search which can account
3:107:6048:18:18:68:543:412:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for this time path of unemployment even in the absence of unobserved heterogeneity. Namely,
3:108:6139:18:18:68:543:394:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:we incorporate one of the best established facts in psychology, that people’s perceptions and
3:109:6232:18:18:68:543:376:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:decisions are influenced by relative comparisons.  We assume that workers have reference-
3:110:6321:18:18:68:543:358:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent preferences over their utility from consumption. As in prospect theory (Kahneman
3:111:6411:18:18:68:543:340:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and Tversky, 1979), workers are loss-averse with respect to consumption below a reference
3:112:6500:18:18:68:473:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:point. Further, we assume that this reference point is given by recent earnings.
3:113:6580:18:18:85:543:304:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:To fix ideas, consider a reference-dependent worker who was just laid off and assume,
3:114:6665:18:18:68:543:286:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for now, hand-to-mouth consumption.  At the time of job loss, the reference point of the
3:115:6753:18:17:68:543:268:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unemployed is the previous wage, which is significantly higher than the unemployment benefit,
3:116:6846:17:18:68:543:251:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the new consumption level. The unemployed, therefore, finds the new state of unemployment
3:117:6935:18:18:68:543:233:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:particularly painful given the loss relative to the reference point, and so she searches hard at
3:118:7031:18:18:68:543:215:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the beginning of a UI spell. Over the weeks of unemployment, however, the reference point
3:119:7120:18:18:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:shifts as the individual adapts to the lower benefit level, and the loss is thus mitigated. Hence,
3:120:7218:18:18:68:543:179:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the worker’s search effort decreases. As the end of the UI benefits draws near, the worker, if
3:121:7312:18:18:68:543:161:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:still unemployed, anticipates the loss in consumption due to the exhaustion of the benefits,
3:122:7404:18:18:68:543:143:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and searches harder. This force is at work also in the standard model, but it is heightened
3:123:7495:18:18:68:543:125:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:by the anticipation of the future loss aversion. If the worker does not find a job by the UI
3:124:7587:18:18:68:475:107:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:expiration, the worker once again slowly adjusts to the new, lower benefit level.
3:125:7668:18:18:85:543:89:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The hazard from unemployment for this reference-dependent worker decreases from the ini-
3:126:7756:18:0:68:543:71:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tial peak, increases at exhaustion, then decreases again. Hence, the predicted hazard matches
4:127:7850:0:18:68:465:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the patterns documented above, even in absence of unobserved heterogeneity.
4:128:7925:18:18:85:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:How would one distinguish the standard job search model from a reference-dependent
4:129:8007:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model? Consider two UI systems, the first offering a constant benefit path until periodT,
4:130:8096:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:with the second offering higher initial benefits up to periodT1< Tbut lower benefits between
4:131:8188:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:T1andT(Figure 1a). The two systems have the same welfare benefit level after periodT.
4:132:8273:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:The standard model with no heterogeneity predicts that, starting from periodT,the hazard
4:133:8361:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:rate in the two systems would be the same, as the future payoffs are identical (Figure 1b).
4:134:8452:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Furthermore, the hazard rate in the periods right before periodTwill be higher in the system
4:135:8544:18:18:68:379:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:with two-step benefits given the lower benefits at that point.
4:136:8606:18:18:85:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The reference-dependent model makes three different predictions (Figure 1c). First, right
4:137:8695:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:after periodTthe hazard in the one-step system would be higher because of the higher loss
4:138:8784:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in consumption compared to the recent benefits. Second, this difference would attenuate over
4:139:8876:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:time and ultimately disappear as the reference point adjusts to the lower benefit level. Third,
4:140:8971:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the hazard rate in the first UI system increases alreadyin advance ofperiodT,in anticipation
4:141:9063:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of the future loss aversion. Notice that, while these predictions are developed in the absence
4:142:9157:18:18:68:539:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of heterogeneity to highlight the intuition, we fully integrate heterogeneity in our estimates.
4:143:9252:18:18:85:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We evaluate a change in the Hungarian unemployment insurance system which is ideally
4:144:9336:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:suited for a test of the above predictions.  Before November 2005, the Hungarian system
4:145:9423:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:featured a constant replacement rate for 270 days, followed by lower unemployment assistance
4:146:9515:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits.  After November 2005, the system changed to a two-step unemployment system:
4:147:9600:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits are higher in the first 90 days, but lower between days 90 and 270, compared to the
4:148:9692:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:pre-period (Figure A-1). There was no major change in the unemployment assistance system
4:149:9780:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:taking place after 270 days.  As such, this UI set-up corresponds to the hypothetical case
4:150:9870:18:18:68:359:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:outlined above with periodTcorresponding to 270 days.
4:151:9923:18:18:85:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:An important feature of the Hungarian reform is that the total benefits paid out until day
4:152:10013:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:270 remain about the same after the reform. Hence, differences in savings and in selection in
4:153:10106:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the pre- and post- period are likely to be small, allowing for a more straightforward comparison.
4:154:10203:18:18:85:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We evaluate the reform by comparing the hazard rates into employment in the year before
4:155:10290:18:18:68:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and after the reform.  The evidence is well in line with the predictions of the reference-
4:156:10380:18:18:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent model. In the weeks immediately preceding the 270-day exhaustion of benefits, the
4:157:10471:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:pre-reform hazard rates rise above the post-reform hazard rates. In the months following the
4:158:10563:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:exhaustion, the pre-reform hazard rates remain higher, and they ultimately converge to the
4:159:10653:18:17:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:post-reform level only after a couple months. The observed pattern around the exhaustion is
4:160:10744:17:18:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:consistent with the anticipation of, and then the direct effect of the higher loss in consumption
4:161:10841:18:18:68:543:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for individuals in the pre-reform. The ultimate convergence between the two hazards indicates,
4:162:10935:18:0:68:413:84:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in this interpretation, the timing of the reference point adjustment.
5:163:11005:0:18:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We present several robustness checks. Controlling for a broad set of controls and alternative
5:164:11098:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:definitions of our sample barely affects the estimated hazards. Also, an interrupted time series
5:165:11194:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:analysis shows that the break in the hazards occurs immediately in the quarter of introduction
5:166:11288:18:18:68:382:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of the reform, and does not appear to reflect previous trends.
5:167:11350:18:17:85:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:While the evidence is qualitatively consistent with predictions of the reference-dependent
5:168:11440:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model, it is important to compare the quantitative fit of the behavioral model with the fit of
5:169:11534:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the standard model allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. To do so, we structurally estimate
5:170:11626:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a model with optimal search effort, log utility, and unobserved heterogeneity in the form of
5:171:11718:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:types of individuals with different search costs.1Given that the reference-dependent model has
5:172:11812:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:two extra parameters (loss-aversion and updating horizon for the reference point), we allow
5:173:11903:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for one less cost type, two versus three in the standard model, thus equating the number of
5:174:11994:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimated parameters. We estimate the model with a minimum-distance estimator, matching
5:175:12081:18:18:68:512:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the empirical hazard rates in the pre- and post-reform to the predictions of the model.
5:176:12168:18:18:85:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The preferred estimate for the standard model does a relatively good job of fitting the
5:177:12255:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazards in the first 200 days. More specifically, the presence of heterogeneous types allows
5:178:12347:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to qualitatively match the spike in the hazard at 90 days post-reform. The standard model,
5:179:12437:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:however, is unable to capture the observed behavior leading up to, and following, the exhaus-
5:180:12530:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tion of benefits. In particular, the hazard rates from day 270 on in the pre- and post-period
5:181:12623:18:17:68:432:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:are predicted to be almost identical, contrary to the empirical findings.
5:182:12696:17:18:85:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The reference-dependent model captures the spike at 90 days and the subsequent decrease,
5:183:12784:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:similar to the standard model (and with a closer fit). Importantly, this behavioral model also
5:184:12878:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:captures key features of the data which the standard model does not fit: the increase in
5:185:12966:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazard in the month prior to the expiration of benefits in the pre-period, the spike at 270
5:186:13057:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days, the decrease thereafter, and the ultimate convergence of the hazard between the pre-
5:187:13147:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and post-period after a few months. The fit of the model is by no means perfect: the model
5:188:13237:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:underpredicts the spike at 270 days and the difference in hazards in the following two months.
5:189:13331:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Still, it captures most of the qualitative features which the standard model does not fit at all.
5:190:13428:18:18:85:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:An important caveat is that these estimates assume hand-to-mouth consumers. However,
5:191:13512:18:18:68:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference-dependent workers should build precautionary savings to smooth the upcoming loss
5:192:13602:18:18:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:utility due to a benefit decrease, eliminating the elevated hazards at benefit exhaustion. Thus,
5:193:13698:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the good fit of the reference-dependent model may depend crucially on an ad hoc assumption.
5:194:13789:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:To address this concern, in our benchmark estimates we incorporate a consumption-savings
5:195:13877:18:17:68:458:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:decision and estimate time preferences in addition to job search parameters.
5:196:13953:17:18:85:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The results point to an important interaction between reference dependence and impa-
5:197:14037:18:18:68:543:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tience. As the intuition above suggested, the reference-dependent model with optimal con-
5:198:14126:18:0:81:525:84:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:1For tractability, the model does not allow for a reservation wage choice, a restriction we revisit later.
6:199:14233:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:sumption does not provide a good fit for the data if we impose high degrees of patience. Once
6:200:14326:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:we allow for estimated discount rates, however, the reference-dependent model fits the data
6:201:14417:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:well, as in the hand-to-mouth estimates. The point estimates indicate a significant weight
6:202:14507:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on gain-loss utility, slow updating of the reference point, and high impatience.  The stan-
6:203:14598:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dard model, with similarly high estimated impatience, fits the data significantly worse than
6:204:14690:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference-dependent model and in fact somewhat worse than the hand-to-mouth stan-
6:205:14775:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dard model.2Thus, the estimates with optimal consumption confirm the better fit of the
6:206:14861:18:18:68:459:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference-dependent model, and additionally point to the role of impatience.
6:207:14937:18:18:85:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:But are these estimates plausible? The estimate for loss aversion is in the range of the
6:208:15025:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:previous literature, but the estimated discount factor is arguably implausibly small at 0.9 for
6:209:15120:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a 15-day period, leading to an annual discount factor of 0.08 (The estimated discount factor
6:210:15212:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for the standard model is similarly small).  What appears to be extreme impatience may,
6:211:15299:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:however, reflect mis-specified time preferences.  Building on evidence in a large number of
6:212:15390:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:settings, including job search (DellaVigna and Paserman, 2005), we allow for present-biased
6:213:15481:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:time preferences (Laibson, 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999), with an additional discount
6:214:15570:18:18:68:332:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:factorβbetween the current period and the future.
6:215:15619:18:18:85:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The estimates allowing for present bias do as well (in fact, attain a better fit) as the
6:216:15707:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimates with exponential discounting, but imply much more reasonable discounting. We
6:217:15793:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimate a present-bias parameterβ=0.58, well within the range of estimates in the literature,
6:218:15887:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for an implied annual discount factor of 0.52 for the first year and 0.88 for later years. The
6:219:15981:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:fit of standard model instead does not improve if we allow for present-bias preferences. Thus,
6:220:16075:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the evidence appears to point, not just to reference dependence, but also to impatience and
6:221:16166:18:18:68:308:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:likely present-bias among unemployed workers.
6:222:16211:18:18:85:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We then examine further the components of the reference-dependent model. The results do
6:223:16298:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:not depend on unobserved heterogeneity: a reference-dependent model with no heterogeneity
6:224:16387:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:provides nearly as good a fit. The results also do not depend on the exact reference-point
6:225:16477:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:updating rule, as the fit is similar with an alternative AR(1) updating assumption. Further,
6:226:16569:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the fit does not depend on allowing for gain utility (achieved at reemployment).  What is
6:227:16658:18:18:68:524:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:critical for the results, as expected, is that loss aversion experienced as income decreases.
6:228:16751:18:18:85:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:How does reference dependence compare to habit formation? Models a la Constantinides
6:229:16835:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999), like the reference-dependent model, induce a
6:230:16920:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:temporarily higher marginal utility of income following a benefit cut as consumption gets
6:231:17009:18:17:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:closer to the habit. Thus, they could plausibly fit the patterns in the data. We highlight
6:232:17099:17:16:81:543:120:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:2In the hand-to-mouth case, the best fit for the standard model is for a relatively high degree of patience.
6:233:17207:16:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:Yet, for such level of patience, the workers should not go hand-to-mouth. Once we endogenize consumption,
6:234:17312:12:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:such estimates with high patience are not optimal any more, given that they would lead the workers to save
6:235:17418:12:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:and thus smooth the benefit jumps more than observed in the data. Thus, endogenizing the consumption
6:236:17518:12:0:68:488:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:decision is an important check for the ability of the standard model to fit the observed patterns.
7:237:17617:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a key difference. In the reference-dependent model, the impact of the loss on search effort
7:238:17708:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is approximately proportional to the size of the loss. Instead, in the habit-formation model
7:239:17800:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:larger decreases in consumption have disproportionate effects. Given this, the habit-formation
7:240:17894:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model underpredicts the spike in hazard at 270 days, since the benefit step-down at 90 days
7:241:17985:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is proportionally larger. We also estimate habit-formation models with multiplicative habits
7:242:18077:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(e.g. Abel, 1990) that are equivalent to reference-dependent models with no loss aversion.
7:243:18167:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:These models provide a better fit than the standard model, though not quite as good as the
7:244:18257:18:18:68:479:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference-dependent model, confirming the role of loss aversion in our estimates.
7:245:18338:18:18:85:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Could alternative versions of the standard model fit the data as well as the reference-
7:246:18425:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent model? We allow for, among other assumptions, different starting assets, back-
7:247:18513:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ground consumption, time-varying search costs, and a delay between search effort and the
7:248:18601:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:jobs start. We also estimate the model using different weights, using probability of exit in-
7:249:18694:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:stead of hazard, and excluding the spikes from the moments. None of these changes sizeably
7:250:18784:18:18:68:443:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:affect the fit of the standard model, or of the reference-dependent model.
7:251:18858:18:18:85:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We then examine alternative forms of unobserved heterogeneity. While in the benchmark
7:252:18943:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimates we assume heterogeneity in search cost in the spirit of Paserman (2008), we allow
7:253:19034:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for more cost types, for heterogeneity in re-employment wage, or in the search elasticity with
7:254:19128:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:respect to the returns to search. The first two forms of heterogeneity do not close the gap with
7:255:19224:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference-dependent model, but the model with heterogeneous search elasticity fits much
7:256:19315:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:better, even outperforming the reference-dependent model. This model explains the observed
7:257:19405:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:spikes by allowing for a type with such high search elasticity (over 50) that only searches once
7:258:19501:18:18:68:225:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits fall below a threshold.
7:259:19533:18:18:85:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:But is the model with heterogeneous search elasticity plausible? We provide two implica-
7:260:19621:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tions and two additional pieces of evidence which, in our view, cast doubt on it. First, this
7:261:19714:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model fits the data well only for very high elasticities; if we restrict the elasticities to be no
7:262:19812:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:higher than 5 (already quite high), the fit does not come close to matching the reference-
7:263:19902:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent model. Second, given the high elasticities, the model makes the unlikely prediction
7:264:19995:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:that, if welfare benefits were lowered, or increased, by just 10 percent, search effort would
7:265:20088:18:18:68:248:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:skyrocket, or conversely go to zero.
7:266:20124:18:18:85:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Further, we examine an earlier UI reform which lengthens the duration of unemployment
7:267:20209:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:assistance. The impact of the reform on the hazard path is very limited, mostly shifting the
7:268:20301:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:spike, consistent with out-of-sample predictions for the reference-dependent model. Instead,
7:269:20393:18:17:68:509:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the model with heterogeneous cost elasticity predicts a substantial dip in the hazards.
7:270:20480:17:18:85:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We also compare the dynamic selection implied by the estimated models to the selection on
7:271:20569:18:18:68:543:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:observables in the data. We show that the selection implied by the standard model differs both
7:272:20663:18:0:68:543:84:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:qualitatively and quantitatively from the observed selection; instead, the implied selection is
8:273:20759:0:18:68:404:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:close to the observed selection for the reference-dependent model.
8:274:20825:18:18:85:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, we briefly discuss other job search models which we do not estimate but which
8:275:20911:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:could potentially explain some of the findings. A model of storable offers (as in Boone and van
8:276:21006:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Ours 2012) could explain the spike in hazard at benefit exhaustion, but not the pattern of the
8:277:21100:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazards in the following months. A model of skill depreciation or screening (e.g. Schmieder
8:278:21191:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:et al., 2016) can explain decreasing hazards over the spell, but such decrease would plausibly
8:279:21285:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:be the same pre- and post-reform. Two classes of models which could potentially explain the
8:280:21376:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:findings are worker learning and consumption commitments (Chetty, 2003 and Chetty and
8:281:21461:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Szeidl, 2016). A worker may learn over time that finding jobs is harder than expected, and this
8:282:21556:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:learning may take place later in the pre-reform period, given the different benefit structure.
8:283:21650:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:A worker with committed consumption would increase search effort to avoid paying a fixed
8:284:21738:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:cost of adjustment; if despite this, she does not find a job soon enough, she will pay the cost
8:285:21833:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and then decrease search. These dynamics could generate some of the hazard patterns after
8:286:21922:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:day 270. While both models have intuitive features, unfortunately neither is tractable enough
8:287:22015:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to estimate on our sample.3For tractability reasons, we also do not estimate models with
8:288:22103:18:18:68:370:442:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:reservation wage choice and optimal consumption-savings.4
8:289:22160:18:18:85:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:To sum up, reference dependence, in combination with impatience, can help explain pat-
8:290:22246:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:terns in job search that are hard to rationalize with most alternative models, even allowing
8:291:22338:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for unobserved heterogeneity. These results have implications for potential redesigns of un-
8:292:22430:17:18:68:502:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:employment insurance policies, a point to which we return briefly in the conclusions.
8:293:22515:18:18:85:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The paper relates to the literature on unemployment insurance design (e.g. Chetty, 2008;
8:294:22603:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Kroft and Notowidigdo, forthcoming; Schmieder et al., 2012a).  Within this literature, we
8:295:22692:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:evaluate a unique reform: changing the time path of the benefit schedule, keeping the overall
8:296:22785:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:payments approximately constant. The paper is consistent with recent evidence of sharp con-
8:297:22876:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:sumption drops at unemployment entry and UI exhaustion for unemployed workers (Ganong

8:299:23046:18:18:85:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The paper also contributes to a literature on behavioral labor economics, including work
8:300:23134:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on employer-employee gift exchange (Akerlof, 1982; Fehr et al., 1993; Gneezy and List, 2006),

8:304:23505:18:17:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dence. We show that a reference-dependent model of job search makes unique predictions,
8:305:23592:17:16:81:543:138:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:3The consumption commitment model requires to keep track of a fixed cost decision, making the model
8:306:23691:16:12:68:543:122:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:cumbersome to estimate. To address this issue, Chetty (2003) makes the timing of fixed cost payment ex-
8:307:23794:12:12:68:543:110:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:ogenous. A consumption commitment model with exogenous consumption readjustment, as in Chetty (2003),
8:308:23895:12:8:68:204:98:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:would not explain our findings.
8:309:23926:8:16:81:543:90:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:4We present in the appendix estimates with reservation wage choice for the hand-to-mouth case.  The
8:310:24025:16:0:68:474:74:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:results should be considered only suggestive, as endogenizing consumption is very important.
9:311:24118:0:18:68:505:711:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:and that the data points to a combination of reference dependence and present bias.5
9:312:24202:18:18:85:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The paper also adds to the evidence on reference dependence from settings including
9:313:24285:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:insurance choice (Sydnor, 2010; Barseghyan et al., 2013), labor supply (Fehr and Goette,
9:314:24373:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:2007; Farber, 2015), domestic violence (Card and Dahl, 2011), goal setting (Allen et al.,

9:316:24557:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference point is the status-quo, or the forward-looking expectation (Kőszegi and Rabin,
9:317:24650:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:2006). We estimate the speed of updating of a backward-looking reference point as in Bowman
9:318:24741:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:et al. (1999), similar to Post et al. (2008). This paper is also part of a literature on structural

9:320:24930:18:18:85:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The papers proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present a model of job search and reference
9:321:25022:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependence. In Section 3 we present the institutional details and the data for the Hungary
9:322:25112:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unemployment insurance reform, which we evaluate in Section 4. In Section 5 we present the
9:323:25202:18:36:68:329:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:structural estimates, and we conclude in Section 6.
9:324:25253:36:30:68:125:460:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:2  Model
9:325:25261:30:18:68:543:430:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:In this section we present a discrete-time model of job search with reference-dependent prefer-
9:326:25356:18:18:68:543:412:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ences and present-biased preferences. We build on the job search intensity model presented in
9:327:25449:18:17:68:543:394:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Card et al. (2007a) and in Lentz and Tranaes (2005) by adding a reference dependent utility
9:328:25540:17:18:68:405:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:function in consumption with a backward looking reference point.
9:329:25604:18:18:85:543:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:Model Setup.As in Card et al. (2007a) we make two simplifying assumptions. First, jobs
9:330:25690:18:18:68:543:341:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:last indefinitely once found. Second, wages are exogenously fixed, eliminating reservation-wage
9:331:25785:18:18:68:543:323:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:choices. Each period a job seeker decides search effortst∈[0,1], representing the probability
9:332:25878:18:18:68:543:305:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of receiving a job offer at the end of periodtand thus of being employed in periodt+ 1.
9:333:25965:18:18:68:543:287:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Search costs are given by the functionc(st), which we assume to be time-separable, twice
9:334:26053:18:18:68:478:269:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:continuously differentiable, increasing, and convex, withc(0) = 0andc′(0) = 0.
9:335:26131:18:18:85:544:251:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In each period individuals receive incomeyt, either UI benefitsbtor wagewt, and consume
9:336:26218:18:18:68:543:233:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:ct.  In the general model consumers smooth consumption over time by accumulating (or
9:337:26302:18:18:68:543:215:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:running down) assetsAt. Assets earn a returnRper period so that consumers face a per-

9:339:26468:18:18:68:427:179:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:consider a simplified model with hand-to-mouth consumption,ct=yt.

9:341:26618:18:17:68:543:143:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:v(.)is an increasing and concave function. The novel aspect is the fact that the reference-

10:356:27660:18:18:68:543:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:utility is higher for losses than for gains. This reference-dependent utility function builds on

10:376:28854:18:18:68:539:235:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Thus,ηλcaptures the weight on additional short-term utility in response to an income loss.

12:484:33512:19:18:85:543:345:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Part a) is straightforward. In the standard model, the search decision depends exclusively
12:485:33602:18:18:68:529:327:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on future benefits and wages, and the reform leaves unaffected the benefits past period T.
12:486:33692:18:18:85:543:309:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The intuition for part b), which we prove in the appendix, is as follows. An increase in
12:487:33780:18:18:68:543:291:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:b1affects search effort in periodTthrough changes inVET+1andVUT+1. These value functions
12:488:33868:18:18:68:543:273:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:are affected because frontloading the benefit path (increasingb1and reducingb2) will reduce
12:489:33959:18:18:68:544:255:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference point at timeT,rT, as long asN  < T. This will increase both the value of
12:490:34046:18:18:68:543:237:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:employment (due to an increase in gain utility) and the value of unemployment (due to a
12:491:34133:18:18:68:543:219:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:decrease in loss utility). Ifλ≥1the decrease in loss utility will be larger than the increase
12:492:34226:18:17:68:340:201:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in gain utility, leading to a reduction in search effort.
12:493:34283:17:18:85:543:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:These predictions are illustrated in Figures 1b) and c). In the standard model (Figure 1b),
12:494:34374:18:18:68:543:166:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:optimal search effort increases under both regimes up until periodT,and then plateaus after
12:495:34465:18:18:68:543:148:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:periodTat a level that is unaffected by the front-loading of benefits (Proposition 1a). Gener-
12:496:34559:18:18:68:543:130:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ally, the hazard rate for the front-loaded regime (the dotted red line) will be higher than the
12:497:34654:18:17:68:509:112:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:one for constant benefits in the periods right before periodT,given the moral hazard.
12:498:34739:17:15:81:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:8Note that search effort in periodtis not affected by UI benefits in periodt, since the individual will
12:499:34842:15:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:only start a job found in periodtin periodt+ 1. Thus search effortstcorresponds to the exit hazard from
12:500:34945:12:0:68:250:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:unemployment in periodt+ 1:st=ht+1.
13:501:34982:0:18:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In contrast, under reference dependence (Figure 1c), search effort in periodTis substan-
13:502:35070:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tially higher under the constant-benefit regime (continuous blue line).  Individuals in this
13:503:35162:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:regime experience a sharper drop in consumption and thus (forN < T) significant loss utility
13:504:35254:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:due to the higher reference point. Second, the difference in hazards persists but shrinks for
13:505:35347:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:Nperiods, at which point the reference point has fully adapted to the lower benefits under
13:506:35437:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:either regime, and thus search effort converges.  A third implication (not captured in the
13:507:35527:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Proposition) is that in the last few periods before periodT, for sufficiently large loss aver-
13:508:35621:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:sionλ, the hazard is higher under the constant-benefit regime compared to the front-loaded
13:509:35711:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:regime. The anticipation of larger future losses under the constant-benefits regime generates
13:510:35804:18:18:68:520:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:this anticipatory effect, counteracting the moral hazard effect of more generous benefits.
13:511:35894:18:18:85:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Notice that Proposition 1 does not hold with either heterogeneity or optimal consumption.
13:512:35983:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:With heterogeneous types, differences in the path of benefits up to periodTmay lead to a
13:513:36071:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:different composition of types surviving at periodT,and thus differences in the hazard even
13:514:36162:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the standard model, violating Proposition 1a). However, given the assumption of constant
13:515:36253:18:18:68:450:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:total benefit payout, differences in type composition are likely to be small.
13:516:36330:18:18:85:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Introducing savings in the model also invalidates Proposition 1 since individuals may have
13:517:36420:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:different savings at periodT, thus creating differences in hazards, even under the standard
13:518:36511:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model. However, given that the total benefit payments are constant, such differences in savings
13:519:36606:18:17:68:538:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:are likely to be small. We address both heterogeneity and savings in the estimation section.
13:520:36698:17:18:85:557:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:Present Bias.We extend the model by allowing for present-bias (Laibson, 1997; O’Donoghue
13:521:36786:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and Rabin, 1999), with an additional discount factorβ≤1between the current period and
13:522:36871:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the future. The present bias factorβinduces time inconsistency and fits behavior in a range of
13:523:36965:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:settings (see Frederick et al., 2002; DellaVigna, 2009). In the context of job search, DellaVigna
13:524:37062:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and Paserman (2005) solve for a job search model with present-biased preferences. We assume
13:525:37153:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:that individuals are naive about their future present-bias: they (wrongly) assume that in the
13:526:37246:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:future they will make decisions based on regular discountingδ. We make this assumption
13:527:37332:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:mostly for computational reasons, since the naive agent problem can be solved using the value
13:528:37425:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:functions of the exponential agent (given that the naive worker believes she will be exponen-
13:529:37518:18:18:68:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tial from next period). In addition, the evidence on present bias is largely consistent with the
13:530:37614:18:18:68:273:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:naivete’ assumption (DellaVigna, 2009).

14:552:38304:26:17:68:543:519:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Hungary had a generous two-tier unemployment insurance system up to 2005. In the first tier,
14:553:38396:17:18:68:543:502:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:potential duration and benefit amount depended on past UI contribution.9The maximum
14:554:38479:18:18:68:543:484:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:potential duration, obtained after around 4 years of contribution, was 270 days,10while the
14:555:38570:18:18:68:543:466:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefit level was based on the earnings in the previous year. After the exhaustion of first-tier
14:556:38666:18:18:68:543:448:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits, unemployment assistance (UA) benefits could be claimed in the second tier. The UA
14:557:38757:18:18:68:534:430:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefit amount was the same for everybody, with the potential duration depending on age.
14:558:38845:18:18:85:543:412:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:On May 30th, 2005 the Hungarian government announced a comprehensive reform of the
14:559:38927:18:18:68:543:394:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:UI system11, with the goal of speeding up transition from unemployment to employment. The
14:560:39016:18:18:68:543:376:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:government changed the benefit calculations formula in the first tier, but did not alter the way
14:561:39112:18:18:68:543:358:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:potential duration and the earnings base were calculated. Before the reform, the benefit in
14:562:39203:18:18:68:543:340:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the first tier was constant with a replacement rate of 65% and with minimum and maximum
14:563:39290:18:18:68:543:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefit caps. The reform introduced a two-step benefit system. For the first step, the length
14:564:39383:18:18:68:543:304:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:was half of the potential duration in the first tier, and at most 91 days, and the replacement
14:565:39477:18:17:68:543:286:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:was lowered to 60% with increased minimum and maximum benefit caps. For most claimants
14:566:39563:17:18:68:543:269:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:these changes meant lower benefits than under the old schedule. In the second tier everybody
14:567:39655:18:18:68:543:251:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:received the new minimum benefit amount, reducing benefits for most claimants compared to
14:568:39744:18:18:68:467:233:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:before. The benefit formula changes are summarized in Appendix Figure A-1.

14:570:39906:18:18:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:UI contributions before lay-off) and base year earnings above the new benefit cap (that is,
14:571:39997:18:18:68:543:179:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:they earned more than 114,000HUF ($570) per month in 2005). As Figure 2 shows, for this
14:572:40084:18:18:68:543:161:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:group the duration of benefits in the first tier remains 270 days. While in the old system the
14:573:40178:18:15:81:543:143:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:9Every worker in the formal sector must pay a UI contribution. In 2005, employers contributed 3% to the
14:574:40281:15:9:68:446:128:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:UI fund, while employees 1%. There is no experience rating of UI benefits in Hungary.
14:575:40366:9:15:77:543:119:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:10More specifically, potential benefit in the first tier was calculated as UI contribution days in the last 4
14:576:40475:15:9:68:249:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:years divided by 5, but at most 270 days.
14:577:40516:9:15:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:11The reform was part of a wider government program called “100 steps”.  Policies related to the labor
14:578:40618:15:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:market and unemployment insurance (such as reemployment bonus and training policies) are discussed later.
14:579:40723:12:0:68:464:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:In addition to that, VAT and corporate income tax were decreased from January 1st 2006.
15:580:40812:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits were constant in the first tier, under the new rules benefits increased substantially
15:581:40906:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the first 90 days, but decreased afterwards. An important feature of the reform for this
15:582:40997:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:group is that the increase in weekly benefits in the first 90 days is about twice as large as
15:583:41090:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the decrease in weekly benefit between 90 and 270 days, keeping the total benefit pay-out for
15:584:41183:18:17:68:307:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:individuals unemployed for 270 days the same.
15:585:41228:17:18:85:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Even though the main element of the reform was the new benefit formula, there were
15:586:41310:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:other changes occurring at the same time.  Most notably, a reemployment bonus scheme
15:587:41394:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:was introduced with a bonus amount equal to 50% of the remaining total first-tier benefits.
15:588:41485:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:However, claiming the bonus was not without costs.  If the bonus was claimed, then the
15:589:41571:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:entitlement for the unused benefit days was nulled. This could be very costly for risk-averse
15:590:41664:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:agents or for those who could only find an insecure job. Also, the bonus could only be claimed
15:591:41758:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:after the date of first-tier benefit exhaustion. This meant hassle costs, since UI claimants had
15:592:41854:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to show up and fill out the paper work in the local UI office. Given these costs, it is not
15:593:41945:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:surprising that the take-up rate of reemployment bonus was only 6%, making it unlikely that
15:594:42036:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:it had substantial effects. As a robustness check, we show that the results are not sensitive to
15:595:42132:18:18:68:371:442:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:dropping the reemployment bonus users from the sample.12
15:596:42188:18:18:85:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In addition to the introduction of the reemployment bonus, there were two other minor
15:597:42273:18:13:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:relevant changes. First, those who claimed UI benefit before February 5th, 2005 faced a longer
15:598:42367:13:22:68:543:393:8:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f5:B:13, but somewhat lower, benefit in the second tier.14To avoid this complication, we only focus
15:599:42461:22:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on those who claimed their benefits after February 5th, 2005.  Second, there were minor
15:600:42548:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:changes in financing training programs.15However, participation in training programs was
15:601:42636:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:very low (less than 5%) in our sample and our results are robust to dropping these claimants.
15:602:42729:18:18:85:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Those who exhausted benefits in both tiers (UI and UA) and were still unemployed could
15:603:42815:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:claim means-tested social assistance. The duration of social assistance is indefinite, while the
15:604:42911:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:amount depends on family size, family income, and wealth. In most cases social assistance
15:605:43000:18:16:77:543:263:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:12Lindner and Reizer (2015) investigate the reemployment bonus in detail and further show that it does not
15:606:43106:16:8:68:219:247:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:affect the unemployment duration.
15:607:43139:8:15:77:543:239:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:13Before the reform, the potential duration in the second tier was 270 days above age 45 and 180 days below
15:608:43246:15:12:68:543:224:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:45. Those who claimed UI after February 5th, 2005 were eligible for 180 days above age 50 and 90 days below
15:609:43353:12:9:68:160:212:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:50 in the second tier.
15:610:43375:9:15:77:543:203:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:14The change in the duration and benefit level in the second tier was introduced at November 1st, 2005
15:611:43477:15:12:68:543:188:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:at the same time as other changes. However, it affected everybody who claimed second tier (UA) benefits
15:612:43580:12:12:68:543:176:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:after November 1st, 2005. A UI claimant who claimed her benefits after February 5th, 2005 and had 270 days
15:613:43686:12:12:68:543:164:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:potential eligibility could only claim second tier benefits (UA) after November 1st, 2005. Therefore, claimants
15:614:43797:12:12:68:543:152:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:between February 5th, 2005 and November 1st, 2005 are under the old benefit system for the first tier, but
15:615:43903:12:8:68:343:140:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:face the same second tier (UA) insurance scheme, see Figure 3.
15:616:43965:8:16:77:543:132:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:15Unemployed participating in training programs received the so-called income substituting benefit. Be-
15:617:44068:16:12:68:543:116:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:fore November 1st, 2005 this amount was 22,200HUF ($111) or 44,400HUF ($222), depending on household
15:618:44168:12:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:characteristics and type of training. This benefit was payed in excess of the UI. After November 1st, the
15:619:44273:12:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:benefit was 34,200HUF ($171) for everybody, but the UI benefit was suspended during training. Although
15:620:44375:12:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:we only observe training participation after November 1st, 2005, aggregate data show that the probability of
15:621:44483:12:0:68:459:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:participation in training programs remained constant throughout this period Frey (2009).
16:622:44573:0:34:68:358:711:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:benefits are lower than the second tier UI benefit level.16
16:623:44632:34:26:68:127:677:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3.2  Data
16:624:44641:26:18:68:543:651:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:We use administrative data17on social security contributions for roughly 4 million individuals
16:625:44735:18:18:68:543:633:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:between January 2002 and December 2008. The sample consists of a 50% de facto random
16:626:44819:18:18:68:543:615:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:sample of all Hungarian citizens who were older than 14 and younger than 75 in 2002.18The
16:627:44908:18:18:68:543:597:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:data contains information on UI claims from February 2004 to December 2008 as well as basic
16:628:44999:18:18:68:543:579:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:information used by the National Employment Service, like the starting and ending date of
16:629:45088:18:18:68:432:561:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the UI benefit spells and the earnings base used for benefit calculation.
16:630:45161:18:18:85:543:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In this paper we only focus on UI claimants who are eligible for the maximum potential
16:631:45247:18:17:68:543:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:duration (270 days) in the first tier. In addition, we restrict our sample to those who are
16:632:45338:17:18:68:543:508:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:older than 25 years and younger than 49 years, since specific rules apply close to retirement.
16:633:45432:18:18:68:543:490:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Moreover, we identify as our main sample UI claimants with high earnings base, since our goal
16:634:45525:18:18:68:543:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is to explore the variation in Figure 2. To construct a consistent sample over time, we focus
16:635:45618:18:18:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on the unemployed with earnings base above the 70th percentile among the UI claimants in a
16:636:45708:18:18:68:515:436:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:given year. In 2005, a UI claimant at the 70th percentile earned 100,800 HUF ($504).19
16:637:45794:18:18:85:543:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:To evaluate the reform, we construct two comparison groups of workers who entered UI
16:638:45878:18:18:68:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:just before or just after the reform, since the claiming date determined the relevant regime.
16:639:45971:18:18:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Due to the change in unemployment assistance in February 2005, we use all UI claimants
16:640:46057:18:18:68:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:between February 5th, 2005 and October 15, 2005 (to avoid getting too close to the reform)
16:641:46147:18:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as our pre-reform group. For the post-reform group, we take UI entrants in the same date
16:642:46235:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:range (February 5 to October 15) in 2006 so as to match possible seasonal patterns. Figure 3
16:643:46327:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:shows the timing of the two comparison groups and the range for which our data is available.
16:644:46419:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:For robustness checks, we later show results using data in the earlier and later ranges as well.
16:645:46515:18:17:85:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Table 1 shows basic descriptives for the two groups. The basic demographic characteristics,
16:646:46606:17:18:68:543:257:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:such as age at time of claiming, education and log earnings in the years 2002 - 2004, are similar
16:647:46703:18:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:before and after the reform. The waiting period (the number of days between job loss and the
16:648:46795:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:time of claiming UI benefits) is almost identical across the two groups, indicating that people
16:649:46890:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:towards the end of our before sample were not trying to delay UI claiming dates in order to
16:650:46981:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:become eligible to the new regime.20The take-up rates of the reemployment bonus scheme,
16:651:47068:18:15:77:543:167:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:16For large families, social assistance can be more generous than UI. However, social assistance cannot be
16:652:47174:15:9:68:380:152:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:claimed before all other benefits have been exhausted in the UI system.
16:653:47245:9:12:77:473:143:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:17The dataset is provided by the Institute of Economics - Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
16:654:47333:12:15:77:543:131:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:18More precisely the sample is composed of everybody born on the 1st of January, 1927, and every second
16:655:47436:15:9:68:295:116:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:day thereafter (3rd of January, 5th of January etc.).
16:656:47489:9:15:77:543:107:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:19Our results are robust to alternative earnings thresholds over time. For example, we estimated our main
16:657:47594:15:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:specifications for those whose (real) earnings base was above 114,000 HUF ($570) and obtained virtually the
16:658:47701:12:8:68:124:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:same results.
16:659:47714:8:0:77:543:72:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:20Appendix Figure A-2 shows the unemployment rate and GDP growth rate around the two periods in
17:660:47811:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:which was introduced in 2005, are quite low. Below we present robustness checks to address
17:661:47901:18:36:68:379:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the possibility that this bonus may have affected our results.

17:678:49120:26:17:68:543:300:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Figure 4a) shows the estimates of equation (8) for eachtwith no controls.  The blue line
17:679:49208:17:18:68:543:283:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:represents the coefficient estimates ofβ0,t, the estimated hazard function in the before period,
17:680:49304:18:18:68:543:265:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:while the red line represents the estimatedβ0,t+β1,t, the after period hazard. Vertical lines
17:681:49397:18:22:68:539:247:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:indicate that the difference between the two series is statistically significant at the 5% level.
17:682:49494:22:12:68:543:225:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:Hungary. The unemployment rate was quite stable at around 7.5 percent during and after the two sample
17:683:49595:12:12:68:543:213:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:periods. GDP growth was also stable during the sample periods, only slowing down at the beginning of 2007.
17:684:49701:12:12:68:543:201:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:Below we show extensive robustness checks, showing that our results are not driven by changes in the economic
17:685:49810:12:12:68:543:189:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:environment that occurred later and that the shape of the hazard rates are in fact very stable over time except
17:686:49921:12:8:68:276:177:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:for the exact point when the UI policy changes.
17:687:49968:8:15:77:543:169:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:21We choose a 15-day period so that the benefit path steps after 90 days and 270 days occur at integer
17:688:50070:15:9:68:493:154:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:values of these periods. The results are very similar with hazards computed at 7 days or 30 days.
17:689:50167:9:15:77:543:145:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:22Note that these hazard functions should not be viewed as consistent estimates at the individual level,
17:690:50271:15:12:68:543:130:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:but rather as estimates of the average hazard function in the population.  While the natural experiment,
17:691:50375:12:12:68:543:118:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:assuming the conditional independence assumption holds, identifies the causal effect of the reform on the
17:692:50480:12:12:68:543:106:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:average population hazard function, the shape of this average hazard function is potentially affected by duration
17:693:50593:12:12:68:543:94:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:dependence or by changes in selection due to the reform. While we address differential selection in our reduced
17:694:50704:12:12:68:543:82:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:form results section by comparing the estimated hazards controlling and not controlling for observables, an
17:695:50811:12:0:68:527:70:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:important aspect of our structural estimation below will be to explicitly model unobserved heterogeneity.
18:696:50918:0:18:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The exit rate from unemployment in the pre-reform period shows a familiar pattern for a
18:697:51005:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:one-step unemployment system. The exit hazard falls in the first months after entering UI,
18:698:51095:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:then it increases as it approaches the exhaustion point of UI benefits (at 270 days). After
18:699:51186:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:this exhaustion point, it falls and spikes again as people exhaust the second tier benefits,
18:700:51278:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unemployment assistance, at 360 days.  The hazard rate then decreases monotonically, as
18:701:51365:17:18:68:363:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unemployed people are only eligible for welfare programs.
18:702:51422:18:18:85:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The exit hazard changes substantially after the introduction of a two-step system. The
18:703:51508:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazard rate increases at 90 days, at the end of the higher unemployment insurance benefit,
18:704:51598:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and remains elevated compared to the pre-reform period for the following 2.5 months. By
18:705:51685:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:180 days, the pre- and post-reform hazards have converged, and both hazards increase at the
18:706:51776:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:exhaustion of UI benefits at 270 days. Importantly though, the post-reform hazard increases
18:707:51867:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:significantly less, and the pre-reform hazard remains significantly higher for three months
18:708:51958:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:following UI exhaustion. Finally, by 360 days, the end of unemployment assistance, the two
18:709:52048:18:18:68:249:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazards have once again converged.
18:710:52082:18:18:85:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The most striking difference occurs around day 270, when in the pre-reform period the
18:711:52167:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:exit hazard remains significantly higher after the UI exhaustion point (270 days) relative to
18:712:52260:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the post-reform period. As we discussed above, this difference in hazards is hard to reconcile
18:713:52354:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:with the standard model: from day 270 onwards, the benefit levels are identical in the pre-
18:714:52445:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and post-period, and in addition the total amount of benefits received up to day 270 is also
18:715:52537:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:almost identical. Hence, in the standard model we would expect similar hazards (even with
18:716:52626:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:heterogeneity, as we show below).  A modified standard model with storable offers could
18:717:52713:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:potentially match the spike at 270 days, but it still does not explain the persistent difference
18:718:52809:18:18:68:307:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the hazards after the exhaustion of benefits.
18:719:52857:18:18:85:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The difference in hazards instead fits nicely with the reference-dependent model: the work-
18:720:52948:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ers in the pre-reform period experience a larger drop-off in benefits around day 270, inducing
18:721:53042:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a spike in loss utility and thus an increase in the value of search. The persistence for three
18:722:53136:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:months of the higher hazard indicates slow adjustment of the reference point. Furthermore,
18:723:53226:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the increase in hazard in the pre-period happens already in anticipation of benefit expiration
18:724:53320:18:18:68:370:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:at day 270, consistent with the reference-dependent model.
18:725:53378:18:18:85:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:While we focus mainly on the hazard rate around day 270 because it leads to the most
18:726:53462:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:distinct predictions, the observed patterns around day 90 are also consistent with reference
18:727:53554:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependence. The spike in the hazard at 90 days in the post-period, corresponding to the first
18:728:53647:18:17:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:step down in benefits, disappears after 3-4 months, consistent once again with loss utility
18:729:53738:17:18:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and a slowly-adjusting reference point. However, the spike itself in this period could also be
18:730:53832:18:18:68:496:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:explained by the standard model with unobserved heterogeneity, as we show below.
18:731:53912:18:0:85:543:84:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Figure 4b) shows the estimated survival function for the two groups.  We obtain these
19:732:53999:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimates using a variant of equation (8), where we estimate the equation again pointwise
19:733:54088:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for alltbut including the whole sample and takingP(t∗i≥t)as the outcome variable. The
19:734:54173:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:survival functions diverge after 90 days, with lower survival probabilities in the after group
19:735:54267:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:than in the before group.  This difference persists until around 300 days, after which the
19:736:54357:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:two lines converge. Since the expected duration in unemployment is simply the integral over
19:737:54448:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the survival function from 0 onwards, the expected unemployment duration is significantly
19:738:54537:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reduced in the after period. It is striking that even though the reform made the UI system
19:739:54627:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:more generous on average (since short term unemployed received more benefits, while the
19:740:54714:18:35:68:490:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:long-term unemployed received about the same), the expected duration decreased.
19:741:54793:35:26:68:211:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:4.3  Robustness Checks
19:742:54815:26:18:68:543:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:The results presented so far do not control for demographic characteristics. Even though the
19:743:54907:18:17:68:543:489:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:differences in demographics between the pre- and the post-period are quite small (Table 1),
19:744:54998:17:18:68:543:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:they could potentially explain differences in the hazard patterns over time if the demographic
19:745:55092:18:18:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:impacts on the hazard rates are large. Thus, we re-estimate equation (8) controlling for a rich
19:746:55187:18:18:68:543:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:set of observable characteristics, where we allow these characteristics to have arbitrary effects
19:747:55284:18:18:68:543:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on the hazard function at each point, the only restriction being that the effect is the same in
19:748:55379:18:18:68:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the before and after period. As Figure 5a) shows, controlling for observables has virtually no
19:749:55473:18:18:68:456:382:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:effect on the hazard rates, implying that they cannot explain our findings.23
19:750:55550:18:18:85:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:A separate concern regards the introduction of the reemployment bonus in November 1st,
19:751:55636:18:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:2005. While the take-up rate of the bonus was just 6% in our sample, it may still affect the
19:752:55728:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazard rate in the post-reform period, especially in the first 90 days. As a check, we drop
19:753:55819:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:all individuals that received a reemployment bonus and estimate our baseline specification on
19:754:55912:18:18:68:434:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:this restricted sample; the results are virtually unchanged (Figure 5b)).
19:755:55985:18:18:85:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In order to assure that the differences in the hazard rates are in fact due to the reform in
19:756:56077:18:17:68:543:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the UI system and not simply the result of some general trend, we exploit the fact that we have
19:757:56172:17:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:additional data from 2004 and after 2006. First, we estimate two placebo tests for whether
19:758:56262:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:there are differences in the two years before the reform and the one year before the reform,
19:759:56354:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:using the same estimation strategy as before. We report these results in Appendix Figure A-
19:760:56445:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:3a), revealing that the hazard rates are virtually unchanged between 2004 and 2005. There is
19:761:56537:18:18:68:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a small difference right after the 270 line, which is expected due to the reduction in unemploy-
19:762:56633:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ment assistance in February 2005, leading to a slight increase in the hazard at this point in
19:763:56726:18:18:68:543:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:2005. Similarly Appendix Figure A-3b) shows that there are virtually no differences between
19:764:56817:18:18:68:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the hazards 1 and 2 years after the reform, again indicating that the differences between our
19:765:56910:18:15:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:23Alternatively we also used propensity score reweighting to estimate the hazards in the pre- and post-period,
19:766:57020:15:0:68:477:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:holding the observables constant over time and obtained almost identical results (not shown).
20:767:57115:0:18:68:350:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:before- and after-period line up nicely with the reform.
20:768:57171:18:18:85:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We explore the timing further by plotting time-series graphs of the exit hazards over
20:769:57256:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:specific intervals. Figure 6a) shows the evolution over time of the exit hazard between 30
20:770:57346:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and 90 days (red line) and between 90 and 150 days (black line).  Each dot indicates the
20:771:57434:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:average hazard for each 3-month period between 2004 and 2007, with quarter 1 indicating
20:772:57521:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the first 3-month period after the reform. Prior to the reform, the hazard at 90-150 days is
20:773:57613:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:smaller than the hazard at 30-90 days, consistent with the patterns in Figure 5. Subsequent
20:774:57704:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to the reform introducing a step down of benefits after 90 days, the pattern abruptly changes.
20:775:57798:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Already in the first quarter after the reform, the hazard at 90-150 days increases sizeably,
20:776:57890:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:becoming similar to the hazard at 30-90 days, a pattern that remains largely similar over the
20:777:57983:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:next 6 quarters. The figure provides little evidence of previous trends, suggesting that the
20:778:58075:18:18:68:370:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:changes in hazards are indeed a causal effect of the reform.
20:779:58135:18:18:85:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Figure 6b) provides parallel evidence for the hazard at 210-270 days versus at 270-330
20:780:58221:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days. In the quarters pre-reform, the hazard at 270-330 days is significantly higher than the
20:781:58314:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazard at 210-270 days, a pattern that changes abruptly with the first quarter following the
20:782:58406:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reform. The time-series plots again indicate a change that is coincidental with the reform and
20:783:58500:18:36:68:445:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:not due underlying trends or changes in the macroeconomic environment.
20:784:58570:36:29:68:217:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5  Structural Estimation
20:785:58594:29:26:68:231:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.1  Set-up and Estimation
20:786:58620:26:18:68:543:333:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:We use the model of Section 2, imposing six additional assumptions, some of which we relax
20:787:58710:18:18:68:543:315:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:later. The first three assumptions concern the utility function. First, we assume that the
20:788:58800:18:18:68:543:297:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f14:B:search cost function has a power form as in Paserman (2008) and Chetty (2003):c(s) =
20:789:58884:18:18:68:543:279:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:ks1+γ/(1 +γ).  This form implies that the parameterγis the inverse of the elasticity of
20:790:58971:18:18:68:543:261:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:search effort with respect to the net value of employment.24Second, we assume log utility,
20:791:59061:18:18:68:543:243:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:v(b) = ln (b). Third, similar to Bloemen (2005) and Paserman (2008), we model heterogeneity
20:792:59152:18:18:68:443:225:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as three types of unemployed workers that differ in their cost of searchk.
20:793:59226:18:17:85:543:207:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Fourth, to avoid modelling on-the-job search, we start the worker problem in the first
20:794:59312:17:18:68:543:190:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:period of unemployment, and thus fit the hazard from the second period on.25Fifth, we set
20:795:59401:18:18:68:543:172:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:past wages equal to the median earnings in our sample, which is 135,000 HUF ($675), and
20:796:59488:18:18:68:542:154:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:assume that reemployment wages are constant over the UI spell and equal to past wages.26
20:797:59576:18:16:77:543:136:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:24To see this, recall that the first-order condition of search effort (equation 4) isc′(s∗) =v,where we
20:798:59679:16:13:68:543:120:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:denote withvthe net value of employment (that is, the right-hand-side of equation 4). Given the parametric
20:799:59785:13:9:68:537:107:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f19:F:assumption, this yieldss∗= (v/k)1/γ,and the elasticity ofs∗with respect tovisηs,v= (ds/dv)v/s= 1/γ.
20:800:59884:9:12:77:407:98:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:25Recall that a successful job search in periodtyields a job in periodt+ 1.
20:801:59959:12:0:77:445:86:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:26In a robustness check, we present estimates assuming a lower reemployment wage.
21:802:60042:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Sixth, we assume that individuals start with zero assets, that they cannot borrow against
21:803:60131:18:18:68:413:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:their future income, and that they earn no interest on saved assets.
21:804:60199:18:18:85:544:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The vector of parametersξthat we estimate for the standard model are: (i) the three
21:805:60282:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:levels of search costkhigh, kmed,andklow,with the assumptionkhigh≥kmed≥klow,and
21:806:60361:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the two probability weightsplowandpmed;(ii) the search cost curvatureγ; (iii) the time
21:807:60447:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:preference parametersδandβ.For the reference-dependent model, we estimate in addition:
21:808:60533:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(iv) the loss aversion parameterλ; and (v) the number of (15-day) periodsNover which the
21:809:60621:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:backward-looking reference point is formed.27To keep the number of parameters the same
21:810:60707:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as for the standard model, in the reference-dependent model we assume only two cost types,
21:811:60797:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:thus removing parameterskmedandpmed. Notice that the weightηon gain-loss utility is set to
21:812:60887:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:1 in the benchmark estimates rather than being estimated; thus, the loss-aversion parameter
21:813:60978:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:λcan be interpreted also as the overall weight on the losses. The reason for this assumption
21:814:61070:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is that over the course of the unemployment spell the individual is always on the loss side
21:815:61161:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:since the benefits are always (weakly) lower than the reference point. Hence, it is difficult to
21:816:61257:18:18:68:371:460:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:estimate a separate weight on gain utility and loss utility.28
21:817:61319:18:18:85:543:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:Estimation.We use a minimum-distance estimator.  Denote bym(ξ)the vector of
21:818:61394:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:moments predicted by the theory as a function of the parametersξ, and byˆmthe vector of
21:819:61481:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:observed moments. The minimum-distance estimator chooses the parametersˆξthat minimize
21:820:61567:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the distance(m(ξ)−ˆm)′W(m(ξ)−ˆm),whereWis a weighting matrix.  As a weighting
21:821:61644:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:matrix, we use a diagonal matrix that has as diagonal elements the inverse of the variance of
21:822:61737:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:each moment.29To calculate the theoretical moments, we use backward induction. First we
21:823:61824:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:numerically compute the steady-state search and steady-state value of unemployment using
21:824:61912:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a hybrid bisection-quadratic interpolation method, pre-implemented in Matlab as the fzero
21:825:62001:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:routine. Then we solve backwards for the optimal search intensity and consumption path in
21:826:62090:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:each period as a function of the asset level. Finally, we use the initial asset level as a starting
21:827:62189:18:18:68:501:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:value to determine the actual consumption path and search intensity in each period.
21:828:62272:18:18:85:541:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:A:Under standard conditions, the minimum-distance estimator using weighting matrixW
21:829:62353:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:achieves asymptotic normality, with estimated variance(ˆG′WˆG)−1(ˆG′WˆΛWˆG)(ˆG′WˆG)−1/N,
21:830:62441:18:0:68:148:209:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f7:B:whereˆG≡N−1

21:833:62521:15:18:68:415:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:numerically in Matlab using an adaptive finite difference algorithm.
21:834:62589:18:18:85:543:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:Moments.As momentsm(ξ)we use the 15-day hazard rates from day 15 to day 540 for
21:835:62668:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:both the pre-reform and post-reform period, for a total of 35*2=70 moments. We do not use
21:836:62757:18:17:68:534:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the hazard from the first 15 day period, since it would require modelling search on the job.
21:837:62849:17:12:77:470:120:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:27In the estimations tables we report the speed of adjustment in days, which is just N*15.
21:838:62939:12:16:77:543:108:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:28In principle, the weight on gain utilityηcan be separately identified as we show in a robustness section,
21:839:63046:16:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:since gain utility affects the utility of reemployment, but the reemployment utility does not allow for very
21:840:63154:12:8:68:180:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:precise identification ofη.
21:841:63181:8:0:77:481:72:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:29As robustness check below, we alternatively use the identity matrix as a weighting matrix.
22:842:63275:0:18:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:Identification.While the parameters are identified jointly, it is possible to address the
22:843:63364:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:main sources of identification of individual parameters. The cost of effort parameterskjare
22:844:63455:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:identified from both the level of search intensity and the path of the hazards over time. This
22:845:63549:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is clearest in the standard model, where the heterogeneity in the parameters is needed, for
22:846:63640:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:example, to explain the decay in the hazard after day 360, when benefits remain constant and
22:847:63732:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:thus, in absence of heterogeneity, the hazard would be constant in the standard model (but
22:848:63822:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:not in the reference-dependent model). The search cost curvature parameter,γ,is identified
22:849:63912:18:18:68:544:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:by the responsiveness of the hazard rate to changes in benefits since1/γis the elasticity of
22:850:64004:18:18:68:376:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:search effort with respect to the (net) value of finding a job.
22:851:64067:18:18:85:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The time preference parameters are identified by the presence of spikes around benefit
22:852:64153:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:cuts, among other moments. If the unemployed workers are patient, they save in advance
22:853:64239:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of benefit decreases so as to smooth consumption. Impatient workers, instead, save little if
22:854:64331:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:at all and thus experience a sharp decrease in consumption around the benefit change. This
22:855:64421:18:18:68:522:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:consumption drop then induces a sharp increase in search effort as the benefits decrease.
22:856:64510:18:18:85:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Turning to the reference-dependence parameters, for a given value ofη(fixed to 1 in the
22:857:64597:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benchmark specification),λdenotes the magnitude of the loss utility. A major component to
22:858:64686:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:identification is the extent to which the hazard for the pre-period is higher both before and
22:859:64779:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:after day 270, in response to a larger loss. Instead, the standard model has essentially identical
22:860:64877:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazards from day 270 onwards. The loss parameter is also identified by the response to other
22:861:64969:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:changes in the benefits, such as at 90 days in the post-period.  The parameterN, which
22:862:65055:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:indicates the speed at which the losses are reabsorbed into the reference point, is identified
22:863:65149:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:by the fact that the pre- and post-reform hazards converge a few months after day 270. The
22:864:65239:18:35:68:538:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:speed of convergence of the hazard after day 90 also suggests several months of adjustment.
22:865:65330:35:26:68:253:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.2  Hand-to-Mouth Estimates
22:866:65358:26:17:68:543:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:To build intuition, we first present estimates assuming that workers in each period consume
22:867:65449:17:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the per-period income. Figure 7a) presents the fit for the standard model with 3-type hetero-
22:868:65542:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:geneity. The model fits quite well the surge in hazard around day 90 in the post-period, and
22:869:65634:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the decreasing path of the hazard in the first 200 days. The fit is also reasonably good for
22:870:65726:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the period from day 400 on. However, the fit between days 250 and 400 is poor. As discussed
22:871:65817:18:18:68:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:above, the standard model predicts that the hazard rates for the pre- and post-period should
22:872:65909:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:be almost exactly the same after day 270. As such, the model misses both the sharp difference
22:873:66002:18:18:68:519:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in hazard between day 260 and day 360, as well as the spikes at both 260 and 360 days.
22:874:66088:18:18:85:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In comparison, Figure 7b) displays the fit of the reference-dependent model with two types
22:875:66178:18:18:68:543:95:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(and thus the same number of parameters as in the standard model). The fit in the first 250
22:876:66269:18:0:68:543:77:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days is very good, though it was quite good also for the standard model. But, as anticipated,
23:877:66364:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the model does much better for longer durations, where the standard model fits poorly. In
23:878:66453:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:particular, the model fits better the surge in the hazard rate in the pre-period in anticipation
23:879:66549:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of the benefit cut after 270 days (which is larger in the pre period than in the post-period), as
23:880:66646:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:well as the elevated level for the following three months, compared to the pre-period. Then
23:881:66737:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the model tracks quite well the period following the exhaustion of unemployment assistance
23:882:66827:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(after 360 days). The fit of the reference-dependent model, while superior to the standard
23:883:66917:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model, is certainly not perfect. The most striking aspect of the data which the model does
23:884:67007:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:not capture is the large spike on day 270 for the pre-period; storable offers may play a role
23:885:67100:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in this case. In addition, the reference-dependent model under-fits the difference in hazards
23:886:67193:18:18:68:313:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:between the pre- and post-period after day 270.
23:887:67240:18:18:85:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Table 2 we present the parameter estimates. The estimates for the standard model (Col-

23:889:67417:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:implies a high elasticity of search effort to incentives, needed to fit the substantial hazard
23:890:67511:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:increases in response to benefits changes. The estimates for the reference-dependent model
23:891:67601:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(Column (2)) indicate a substantial weight on loss utility,ˆλ= 3.5(s.e. 1.3), and slow adjust-
23:892:67695:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ment of the reference point,ˆN= 216(s.e. 9) days. At the bottom of the Table, we report the
23:893:67786:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:goodness of fit (GOF) measure(m(ξ)−ˆm)′W(m(ξ)−ˆm). The reference-dependent model
23:894:67866:18:34:68:516:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:has a substantially better fit (GOF of 170 versus 215), for equal number of parameters.

23:896:68002:26:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:While the previous estimates indicate that a reference-dependent model can fit the patterns in
23:897:68096:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the data quite well, there is a key concern with the hand-to-mouth estimates. Individuals who
23:898:68189:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:anticipate experiencing loss utility from a benefit cut should save in anticipation, allowing
23:899:68282:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:them to smooth consumption around the benefit cut. In turn, this would imply smoother
23:900:68367:18:18:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:hazards around the benefit cuts than in the data. This consumption smoothing, however, is
23:901:68456:18:17:68:267:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ruled out in the hand-to-mouth model.
23:902:68493:17:18:85:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:A parallel issue arises for the hand-to-mouth estimates of the standard model. The esti-
23:903:68581:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:mated patience parameter in the standard model (ˆδ=.98) implies forward-looking individuals
23:904:68672:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:who are quite responsive in their search effort to future benefit cuts. And yet, by assumption
23:905:68766:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:these individuals do not save in anticipation of the cuts. For these reasons, we now turn to
23:906:68858:18:18:68:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the estimates modelling a consumption-savings choice, in addition to the search effort choice.
23:907:68952:18:18:85:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Figure 8a) shows the fit for the standard model with three types, compared with the fit in
23:908:69042:18:18:68:543:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Figure 8b) for a reference-dependent model with two types (with once again the same number
23:909:69132:18:18:68:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of parameters). The qualitative fit is similar to the fit obtained for hand-to-mouth consumers
23:910:69226:18:18:68:515:95:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(Figures 7a) and b)): the reference-dependent model better fits the path in the hazard.
23:911:69313:18:0:85:543:77:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:How is that possible in light of the above intuition about counteracting savings? For an
24:912:69403:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:answer, we turn to Table 3 which displays the corresponding parameter estimates in Columns
24:913:69493:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(1) and (2). The most striking element is the high estimated degree of impatience: 15-day
24:914:69582:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:discount factors ofδ= 0.89for the reference-dependent model andδ= 0.93for the standard
24:915:69668:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model. Either estimate implies an annual discount factor of 0.17 or lower. Appendix Figure
24:916:69758:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:A-4a) provides further evidence on the identification of the discount factor. Each point in
24:917:69849:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the figure indicates the goodness of fit of the best-fitting estimate for a particular (15-day)
24:918:69944:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:discount factor. For patient individuals (δ= 0.995or higher), the reference-dependent model
24:919:70035:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:does poorly: loss-averse workers with a high degree of patience would build a buffer stock,
24:920:70126:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f14:B:thus smoothing the loss utility. As individuals become more impatient, already forδ= 0.95
24:921:70215:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference dependent model has a good fit (and better than the standard model), with the
24:922:70306:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:best fit, as we saw in the table, for an even lower discount factor. The fit of the standard
24:923:70398:18:18:68:443:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model also improves as the discount factor decreases, though less steeply.
24:924:70472:18:18:85:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:These results stress the importance of modelling optimal consumption: both the standard
24:925:70559:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model and the reference-dependent model have a somewhat worse fit compared to the hand-to-
24:926:70649:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:mouth estimates. The hand-to-mouth results embed an inconsistent combination of relatively
24:927:70739:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:high patience (and thus forward-looking search effort) and yet no consumption smoothing. In
24:928:70830:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the consumption-savings model, the discount factor drives at the same time both the search
24:929:70920:18:18:68:540:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:decision and the consumption-savings decision, putting additional restrictions on the model.
24:930:71012:18:17:85:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Returning to the point estimates, the downside of this set of results is that the model which
24:931:71105:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:best accommodates the data – the reference-dependent one – requires a degree of impatience
24:932:71195:18:18:68:543:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:which is hard to reconcile with other estimates in the literature. Yet, this high estimated
24:933:71286:18:18:68:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:degree of impatience may be due to a mis-specification of the discounting function. A growing
24:934:71379:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:body of evidence, summarized among others in Frederick et al. (2002) and DellaVigna (2009),
24:935:71470:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:suggests that the beta-delta model of time preferences due to Laibson (1997) and O’Donoghue
24:936:71561:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and Rabin (1999) provides a better fit of observed behavior in a number of settings. The beta-
24:937:71655:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:delta model includes an additional discount factorβbetween the present and the next period
24:938:71745:18:18:68:366:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to capture the present bias, inducing a time inconsistency.
24:939:71804:18:18:85:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Thus, in a second set of estimates we allow for beta-delta discounting30in both the stan-
24:940:71893:18:18:68:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dard model and the reference-dependent model. To keep the number of parameters constant,
24:941:71981:18:18:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:we set the long-term discount factorδto .995. The results in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3
24:942:72072:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and in Figure 8c) show that the fit is better than in the models with delta discounting for the
24:943:72167:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference-dependent model with much more plausible discounting: the estimated present-bias
24:944:72257:18:17:68:544:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:parameter isβ= 0.58,implying a discount factor of 0.46 for the first year and of 0.88 for
24:945:72346:17:18:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:subsequent years.  This indicates a substantial degree of impatience, but in line with esti-
24:946:72438:18:16:77:543:102:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:30We assume that consumers are naive about the future self-control problem mostly for computational
24:947:72537:16:12:68:543:86:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:simplicity, especially given the complexity of estimating the consumption decision. In addition, the naiveté
24:948:72645:12:0:68:404:74:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:assumption is arguably better supported by the evidence (DellaVigna, 2009).
25:949:72722:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:mates in the literature. For example, Paserman (2008), building on the model in DellaVigna
25:950:72812:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and Paserman (2005), estimates a job search model with beta-delta preferences and obtains
25:951:72901:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:estimates for beta ranging between 0.40 and 0.89, depending on the sample. Laibson et al.
25:952:72990:18:18:68:506:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(2007), based on life-cycle consumption choices, estimates aβbetween 0.51 and 0.82.
25:953:73073:18:17:85:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In light of both the higher plausibility and the better fit, we adopt the reference-dependent
25:954:73166:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model with beta-delta discounting as the benchmark behavioral model in the rest of the paper.
25:955:73259:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:For the standard model, especially given the small difference in fit between the two discounting
25:956:73355:18:18:68:356:586:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:functions, we use the more standard delta discounting.31
25:957:73411:18:18:85:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:How do the two models achieve their fit? In Appendix Figures A-5 and A-6 we report plots
25:958:73499:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for key model components, focusing on the high-cost type. In the standard model, the flow
25:959:73588:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:utility follows the step down in the benefits, with the size of the later steps accentuated by the
25:960:73686:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:curvature of the utility function. In the reference-dependent model, the flow utility captures
25:961:73780:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:also the intensity of the loss relative to the reference point.  The value of unemployment
25:962:73870:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:decreases over time in the standard model as expected, while in the reference-dependent
25:963:73957:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model it actually increases over most of the range, reflecting the importance of reference
25:964:74047:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:point adaptation. This fits the observed decrease in search effort over time, even for a given
25:965:74141:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:type.  Furthermore, the value of unemployment declines sharply in correspondence to the
25:966:74228:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefit drop. (This sharp drop reflects the estimated impatience). The next panel shows the
25:967:74319:18:17:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference point path, which is decreasing over time. Notice that from around day 250 the
25:968:74407:17:18:68:543:371:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference point is higher in the pre-reform group, which contributes to generate higher loss
25:969:74499:18:18:68:438:353:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:utility and thus a larger increase in search effort near benefit expiration.
25:970:74575:18:18:85:543:335:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Appendix Figure A-6, the value of employment, which is almost constant in the standard
25:971:74664:18:18:68:543:317:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model, increases monotonically over time for the reference-dependent model, as getting a job
25:972:74756:18:18:68:543:299:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is associated with a larger gain utility as the reference point declines. This latter force does not
25:973:74856:18:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:account for much of the results, as we illustrate later when we turn off gain utility. Turning to
25:974:74953:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:consumption and assets, consumption tracks quite closely the per-period earnings, especially
25:975:75045:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the reference-dependent model. As such, assets get depleted quickly and remain at zero
25:976:75134:18:18:68:543:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:or close for the rest of the spell. While we do not observe consumption in our data, other
25:977:75224:18:18:68:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:work (e.g. Ganong and Noel, 2015) has documented that consumption for UI recipients tracks
25:978:75314:18:18:68:452:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:income rather closely with sharp drops at UI entry and benefit exhaustion.
25:979:75388:18:18:85:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In the final set of columns in Table 3 we return to a key motivation of the paper. We
25:980:75473:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:argued that the reference-dependent model can, at least in principle, capture the qualitative
25:981:75566:18:17:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:features of the hazard from unemployment without any heterogeneity. Yet, the estimates of
25:982:75655:17:18:68:543:120:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference-dependent model allow for two heterogeneous types. In Columns (5) and (6), we
25:983:75742:18:18:68:543:102:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:remove any heterogeneity and estimate the reference-dependent model with only one cost type.
25:984:75834:18:16:77:543:84:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:31The results for the reference-dependent models with either delta or beta-delta discounting are qualitatively

26:988:76172:18:34:68:466:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:fit is almost as good as in the reference-dependent models with heterogeneity.
26:989:76250:34:25:68:285:641:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.4  Reference-Dependence Variants
26:990:76284:25:18:68:543:616:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:In Table 4 we consider variants of the benchmark reference-dependent model, reproduced in
26:991:76373:18:18:68:543:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Column (1). First, instead of defining the reference point as the average of income over the
26:992:76465:18:36:68:441:580:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:Nprevious periods, we assume an AR(1) process for the reference point:
26:993:76535:36:0:202:363:544:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f14:?:rt=ρrt−1+ (1−ρ)yt= (1−ρ)

26:997:76570:37:18:85:543:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:This updating rule has longer “memory” and adjusts more smoothly than the benchmark
26:998:76653:18:18:68:543:489:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reference point, with the speed of adjustment captured byρ.32Column (2) of Table 4 shows
26:999:76741:18:18:68:543:471:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the estimated speed of adjustmentρ=0.77, which implies faster adjustment (half-life is 40
26:1000:76830:18:18:68:543:453:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days) than in the benchmark case. The goodness of fit with AR(1) updating is very similar
26:1001:76919:18:18:68:514:435:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:to the one in the benchmark estimates. Figure 9a) shows the fit of this AR(1) model.33
26:1002:77005:18:17:85:543:417:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we disentangle the role played by gain and loss utility. So far, we have arbitrarily set
26:1003:77099:17:18:68:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the gain utility parameter,η, to 1 and estimated the weight on loss utility,ηλ. In Columns
26:1004:77189:18:18:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(3) and (4) we examine the role of gain and loss utility by including only one at a time in the
26:1005:77284:18:18:68:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model. In Column (3) we assume no gain utility when workers get a job, but still estimate
26:1006:77373:18:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the loss utility weightηλ. The fit of the model, visible in Figure 9b), is almost as good as
26:1007:77465:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the benchmark reference-dependent one, and the estimated speed of updating of the reference
26:1008:77556:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:point is nearly the same (though not, as expected, the estimated loss aversion). In Column
26:1009:77646:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(4), we instead assume no loss utility and model gain utility. This model does worse than
26:1010:77735:18:18:68:512:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:even the standard model (Figure 9c). This indicates the key role played by loss utility.
26:1011:77823:18:18:85:543:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we present a parallel take on this result. Columns (5) and (6) report the estimates
26:1012:77912:18:18:68:543:238:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:B:setting, respectively, a value ofηof 0.2 and of 5. As the (assumed) weight on gain utilityη
26:1013:78003:18:18:68:543:220:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:increases, the estimatedλdecreases, holding the termηλ, which is the weight on loss utility,
26:1014:78095:18:18:68:543:202:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:at comparable (though not constant) levels.  The goodness of fit under these alternative
26:1015:78183:18:17:68:543:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:assumptions forηis almost the same as in the standard model. In Column (7), we estimate
26:1016:78270:17:15:77:543:167:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:32When we implement this estimate we assume that the memory of the AR(1) update goes back to 1050
26:1017:78367:15:9:68:190:152:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:days (or 70 15-day periods).
26:1018:78395:9:15:77:543:143:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:33We adopt as benchmark the N-period reference point for computational reasons, since the long memory
26:1019:78496:15:12:68:543:128:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:of the AR(1) model makes the estimates more time-consuming. In addition, we do not estimate models with
26:1020:78599:12:12:68:543:116:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:a forward-looking reference point as in Kőszegi and Rabin (2006). These models typically give rise to multiple
26:1021:78709:12:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:equilibria which would complicate the model solution significantly. However, notice that it is unclear that
26:1022:78816:12:12:68:543:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:forward-looking reference points would explain the difference in hazards after period 270. By that point, the
26:1023:78925:12:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:forward-looking reference points would presumably be the same in the pre- and post-period, leading to similar
26:1024:79034:12:0:68:407:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:predictions for the two periods (up to equilibrium selection), counterfactually.
27:1025:79116:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:separatelyηandλ, with the fit shown in Figure 9d). The two parameters are in principle
27:1026:79202:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:separately identified, but the estimate forη(4.5) is imprecise, and the goodness of fit is again
27:1027:79298:18:34:68:505:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:close to the benchmark model. As such, in the rest of the paper we holdηfixed to 1.
27:1028:79381:34:26:68:197:641:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.5  Habit Formation
27:1029:79401:26:18:68:543:615:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:How does reference dependence compare to habit formation?  Models a la Constantinides
27:1030:79486:18:18:68:543:597:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999) assume utilityu(c−zr),whereris the habit
27:1031:79566:18:18:68:543:579:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:formed from past consumption anduis a concave function. Habit formation, like reference
27:1032:79653:18:18:68:543:561:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependence, induces a temporarily high marginal utility following a benefit cut, as consump-
27:1033:79745:18:18:68:533:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:tioncgets closer to the habitzr. Thus, it could also plausibly fit the patterns in the data.
27:1034:79837:18:18:85:543:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We estimate a version of a habit formation model replacing the reference dependent utility
27:1035:79927:18:32:68:328:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:function (defined in Equation (1)) with the utility:
27:1036:79979:32:33:246:365:475:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:?:v(ct, rt) = log(ct−zrt),
27:1037:80003:33:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:wherezcaptures the responsiveness to changes in the habit andrtis calculated the same way
27:1038:80092:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as before, but reinterpreted as a measure of habit stock.34The estimates are in Columns (1)
27:1039:80183:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and (2) of Table 5, allowing for a fixed N for updating of the reference point and for an AR(1)
27:1040:80278:18:18:68:543:388:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:process. In either case, the fit is not close to the fit of the reference-dependent model, and is
27:1041:80375:18:18:68:433:370:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in fact slightly worse than the standard model (see also Figures 10a-b).
27:1042:80447:18:18:85:543:352:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:This may appear surprising given the similar intuition behind the two models. The models
27:1043:80535:18:18:68:543:334:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:however differ in a key aspect.  In the reference-dependent model, the impact of the loss,
27:1044:80625:18:18:68:543:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:λ(u(c)−u(r)),on search effort is approximately proportional to the size of the loss. Instead,
27:1045:80718:18:17:68:543:298:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the habit-formation model larger decreases in consumption have disproportionate effect,
27:1046:80808:17:18:68:543:281:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ascgets closer tozr. Given this, the habit-formation model fits the data less well, since it
27:1047:80900:18:18:68:543:263:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:predicts a larger spike at the 90-day (post reform) benefit decrease, and a much smaller spike
27:1048:80994:18:18:68:543:245:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for the later (proportionally smaller) benefit decreases.35Allowing for three unobserved types
27:1049:81088:18:18:68:297:227:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(Column (3)) only partially improves the fit.
27:1050:81133:18:18:85:543:209:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we consider a second type of habit-formation models with so-called multiplicative
27:1051:81220:18:18:68:543:191:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:habits (Abel, 1990), with utilitylog(c)−zlog(r).This utility function is equivalent (up to a
27:1052:81312:18:18:68:543:173:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:linear transformation) to our reference-dependent model with loss aversionλset to 1 andηset
27:1053:81403:18:18:68:543:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:toz/(1−z). In Column (4) (and in Figure 10d) we present estimates from this multiplicative-
27:1054:81494:18:18:68:543:137:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:habit model: the fit is superior to the one of the first habit-formation model, though still not
27:1055:81590:18:15:77:543:119:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:34Observe that this function is not defined wheneverct< zrt, complicating the estimation. To avoid this
27:1056:81693:15:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:problem, Campbell and Cochrane (1999) madeza non-linear function ofyt−rt. We treatzas a parameter
27:1057:81790:12:9:68:484:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:instead and check in the optimum that our utility function is defined for the relevantytandrt.
27:1058:81884:9:15:77:543:83:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:35In addition, the habit-formation model is also computationally trickier to estimate, as the estimated habit
27:1059:81993:15:0:68:309:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:parameterγhas to always satisfy the conditionc > γr.
28:1060:82047:0:35:68:524:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:close to the benchmark model. This result stresses again the importance of loss aversion.
28:1061:82136:35:25:68:165:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.6  Robustness
28:1062:82151:25:18:68:543:651:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:In Table 6 we consider the robustness of the standard and reference-dependent model to
28:1063:82237:18:18:68:476:633:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:alternative specifications. We present additional checks in Appendix Table A-1.
28:1064:82316:18:18:85:544:615:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Column (1) we estimate both time preference parameters,βandδ. While the fit is
28:1065:82397:18:18:68:543:597:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:somewhat better than in the benchmark models, the two time preference parameters appear
28:1066:82484:18:18:68:543:579:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to be quite collinear; thus, in the benchmark specifications we fix one of the two parameters.
28:1067:82578:18:18:68:543:561:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:In Column (2) we allow for background consumption: workers receive non-market income
28:1068:82662:18:18:68:543:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:B:nduring unemployment, in addition to the benefits earned, to capture home production.
28:1069:82747:18:18:68:543:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:The estimates are very similar to the standard ones. In Column (3), while still allowing for
28:1070:82839:18:18:68:543:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:background consumption, we make the alternative assumption that workers are not eligible
28:1071:82927:18:17:68:544:489:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:for welfare; thus, benefits fall to 0 after 360 days.36This alternative assumption improves
28:1072:83018:17:18:68:543:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:somewhat the fit of both the reference-dependent model and the standard model. In Column
28:1073:83106:18:18:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(4) we allow for a linear time trend in the baseline cost factor allowing for skill depreciation or
28:1074:83205:18:18:68:543:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:conversely learning by searching. This additional parameter improves the fit of the reference-
28:1075:83299:18:18:68:493:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent model while leaving the fit of the standard model essentially unaffected.
28:1076:83382:18:18:85:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Column (5) we explore the role played by the spikes at days 270 and 360, since one may
28:1077:83471:18:18:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:worry that such spikes play a disproportional role in the identification given the quadratic
28:1078:83563:18:18:68:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:distance measure. The model estimated dropping these moments from the objective function
28:1079:83651:18:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(see also Appendix Figure A-7c and d) yields similar patterns indicating that the results are
28:1080:83744:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:not driven by the spikes. We also consider the importance of timing in the model. We assume
28:1081:83835:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:that jobs start one period after the offer is received, but what if the hiring process takes longer?
28:1082:83935:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:In Column (6) we assume a 2-period (that is, approximately one-month) delay between the
28:1083:84022:18:18:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:job search and the start of the wage payments. As Appendix Figures A-8a) and b) show, the
28:1084:84111:18:17:68:543:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:change in timing does not shift the spike. Rather, job-seekers start their search effort earlier,
28:1085:84208:17:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:taking into account the longer delay. In Column (7) we allow for a lower reemployment wage
28:1086:84298:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:set at two thirds of the average previous wage. The alternative assumption worsens somewhat
28:1087:84389:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the fit of both models, with little substantive impact on the estimates. In Column (8) we test
28:1088:84483:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the importance of the assumption of zero initial assets: endowing workers with $600 in their

28:1090:84667:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and b)), though the fit is somewhat worse than under the assumption of zero assets (which
28:1091:84756:18:18:68:381:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:itself is most consistent with the estimated high impatience).
28:1092:84818:18:18:85:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Appendix Table A-1 we present additional robustness results. In Column (1) we use
28:1093:84902:18:16:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:36While unemployed workers are generally eligible for welfare after benefit exhaustion, the rules are complex
28:1094:85011:16:0:68:471:79:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:and we do not observe a good measure of welfare take up. Thus, we explore this alternative.
29:1095:85104:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the identity matrix to weight the moments and in Column (2) we use the moments estimated
29:1096:85192:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:after controlling for observables (shown in Figure 5b)). Though the goodness of fit cannot be
29:1097:85285:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:compared to the previous estimates, the qualitative conclusions remain the same. In Columns
29:1098:85376:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(3) and (4), instead of using the hazard rates as moments, we use the estimated (unconditional)
29:1099:85471:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:probability of exiting unemployment in each 15-day period. The advantage of this alternative
29:1100:85563:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:procedure is that we can use the full variance-covariance matrix for weights, which we do
29:1101:85652:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in Column (3). Once again, while the goodness of fit measures are not comparable to the
29:1102:85739:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benchmark models, the pattern of the results is very similar. Finally, the estimates are similar
29:1103:85835:18:35:68:443:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:if we use the 30-day hazards or 7-day hazards, instead of 15-day hazards.
29:1104:85908:35:26:68:255:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.7  Unobserved Heterogeneity
29:1105:85937:26:18:68:543:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:So far, we have modeled one form of heterogeneity, in search costs,37and allowed for a fixed
29:1106:86029:18:17:68:543:489:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:number of types: three in the standard model and two in the behavioral model. In Table 7,
29:1107:86118:17:18:68:208:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:we relax both assumptions.
29:1108:86144:18:18:85:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:First, we increase the number of heterogeneous cost types from 2 types (Column (1)) all the
29:1109:86235:18:18:68:543:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:way to 5 types (Column (4)). Allowing for additional types in the standard model improves the
29:1110:86328:18:18:68:543:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:fit all the way to 4 types; estimates with 5 or more types have trouble converging. Still, even
29:1111:86423:18:18:68:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the model with 4 or 5 types does significantly worse in terms of fit than the reference-dependent
29:1112:86520:18:18:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model (Figure 11a). For the reference-dependent model, there is essentially no improvement
29:1113:86610:18:18:68:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in fit going from 2 types to more types. Indeed, estimates of the reference-dependent model
29:1114:86701:18:18:68:317:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:with more than 3 types have trouble converging.
29:1115:86748:18:18:85:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we consider alternative forms of unobserved heterogeneity, such as in the reemploy-
29:1116:86837:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:ment wage. We take the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of the reemployment wage, as well
29:1117:86925:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:as the fractions of each type (taken to be 20 percent, 60 percent, and 20 percent respectively)
29:1118:87020:18:18:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:from the data. We then estimate three cost parameterskj, one for each type. This alternative
29:1119:87112:18:17:68:543:256:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:specification (Column (5)) improves somewhat the fit of the standard model, as Figure 11b)
29:1120:87202:17:18:68:493:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:also shows, but the fit of the reference-dependent model is still significantly better.
29:1121:87289:18:18:85:544:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:In Column (6) we allow for heterogeneity in the curvature parameterγ. While this form
29:1122:87374:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of heterogeneity does not affect the estimates of the reference-dependent model, it improves
29:1123:87466:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dramatically the fit of the standard model. The estimates fit both the spike at 270 and at 360
29:1124:87560:18:18:68:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days, as well as the difference between the pre- and post-reform period (Figure 11(c)). Indeed,
29:1125:87655:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:this is the only specification with a better fit than the reference-dependent model. How does
29:1126:87748:18:18:68:543:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:this model attain such good fit? The fit relies heavily on types with a very different elasticity
29:1127:87845:18:18:68:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of search (which equals1/γ). Initially, most exits are of the low-elasticity types (γhigh= 1.01),
29:1128:87942:18:18:68:543:95:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:but the spike at day 270 is driven by the medium-elasticity types (γmed= 0.20). These types
29:1129:88033:18:0:77:522:77:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:A:37The heterogeneity on search costs is based on papers such as Bloemen (2005) and Paserman (2008).
30:1130:88133:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:were barely searching up until day 270, but their search intensity spikes in presence of lower
30:1131:88227:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benefits. The spike at 360 days is due to the high-elasticity types, with an elasticity over 50
30:1132:88322:18:18:68:424:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:(γlow= 0.016), that start searching once benefits hit the welfare level.
30:1133:88394:18:18:85:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:How critical are the high-elasticity types for the fit of the model?  We re-estimate the
30:1134:88482:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model restricting the elasticity to be no higher than 10 (γ≥0.1, Column (7)) and no higher
30:1135:88572:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:than 5 (γ≥0.2, Column (8)). With such restrictions in place, the model does not match any
30:1136:88661:18:35:68:421:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:more the fit of the reference-dependent model (see also Figure 11d)).
30:1137:88730:35:26:68:281:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:5.8  Tests of Gamma Heterogeneity
30:1138:88763:26:18:68:543:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:The previous sections show that only one version of the standard model matches (in fact,
30:1139:88851:18:17:68:543:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:surpasses) the fit of the reference-dependent model: the gamma-heterogeneity model. How
30:1140:88938:17:18:68:543:508:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:should we compare then the two models? In this section we present a calibration and additional
30:1141:89032:18:18:68:320:490:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:evidence, with more evidence in the next section.
30:1142:89081:18:18:85:543:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:As we just showed, the gamma-heterogeneity model requires two types with a very large
30:1143:89166:18:18:68:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:elasticity of search effort. To consider the implications of such elasticities, consider a hypo-
30:1144:89262:18:18:68:543:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:thetical comparative statics: a 10 percent increase, or decrease, in the level of welfare benefits
30:1145:89360:18:18:68:543:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:paid out after 360 days. Figures 12a) and b) show that, in response to such a small benefit
30:1146:89451:18:18:68:543:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:change, the search effort of reference-dependent workers would barely change compared to the
30:1147:89543:18:18:68:543:382:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:benchmark estimates. In the gamma-heterogeneity model, instead, the hazard rates would
30:1148:89629:18:18:68:543:364:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:go to nearly 1 (for a 10% benefit decrease, Figure 12a)) or to nearly 0 (for a 10% increase,
30:1149:89721:18:18:68:543:346:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:Figure 12b)). The workers still unemployed by day 360 are mostly the high-elasticity types,
30:1150:89812:18:18:68:543:328:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:and even small changes in the setting lead to massive changes in search effort. We find this
30:1151:89904:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:implied response unrealistic. Importantly, this high elasticity, and thus the ensuing extreme
30:1152:89997:18:18:68:514:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:response, is critical for the fit of the gamma-elasticity model, as we documented above.
30:1153:90085:18:17:85:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:While there are no reforms in the welfare system in our period, we do observe a reform
30:1154:90171:17:18:68:543:257:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the unemployment assistance system occurring one year before our ‘pre’ period (see Figure
30:1155:90263:18:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:3). The benefit duration in this second tier goes from 180 days before the change to 90 days
30:1156:90355:18:18:68:543:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:after the change for the individuals in our sample.38We use this reform, which we have not
30:1157:90445:18:18:68:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:employed so far, as an out-of-sample test, since the macroeconomic setting was similar and
30:1158:90535:18:18:68:281:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the group of workers affected is the same.
30:1159:90577:18:18:85:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Figure 12c) shows the hazard for the 2-year-prior period, as well as the predictions for
30:1160:90665:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the benchmark reference-dependent estimates (Column (4) in Table 3) and for the gamma-
30:1161:90751:18:18:68:543:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:heterogeneity estimates (Column (6) in Table 7).  The reference-dependent model fits the
30:1162:90839:18:18:68:543:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:pre-period well, with an out-of-sample SSE of 73.4. The gamma heterogeneity model, instead,
30:1163:90930:18:15:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:38This change applied to individuals aged 45 and lower. Since our sample includes only individuals up to 50
30:1164:91037:15:12:68:543:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:years old, the reform applies to the large majority of the sample. Excluding the 46-50 year olds barely affects
30:1165:91148:12:0:68:128:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:the estimates.
31:1166:91164:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:fits quite poorly the period of the lengthened unemployment assistance (between 300 and
31:1167:91251:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:450 days), with an out-of-sample SSE of 130.5. In this period, the medium-elasticity types
31:1168:91341:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:are disappearing from the sample, and the high-elasticity types are not searching yet. The
31:1169:91431:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:gamma heterogeneity type appears to overfit the data in sample. The out-of-sample fit of the
31:1170:91523:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:standard model with heterogeneity in cost levels is better (SSE of 91.6), but does not reach
31:1171:91615:17:35:68:518:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the reference-dependent model. We present a final piece of evidence in the next section.

31:1173:91749:26:18:68:543:561:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:The standard model captures reasonably well the dynamics in the hazards in the first 270
31:1174:91837:18:18:68:543:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:days as well as some of the trend after that, especially in the gamma-heterogeneity version.
31:1175:91929:18:18:68:543:525:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:To achieve this fit, changes in the unobserved types over time play a key role; without types,
31:1176:92023:18:18:68:543:507:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the hazards would be monotonically (weakly) increasing over time. How plausible then is the
31:1177:92114:18:17:68:543:489:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:amount of heterogeneity that the standard model requires? And how does it compare to the
31:1178:92202:17:18:68:355:472:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:heterogeneity needed in the reference-dependent model?
31:1179:92256:18:18:85:543:454:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:While we cannot measure the time-changing unobserved heterogeneity, we propose that a
31:1180:92341:18:18:68:543:436:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:useful metric is the time-varying selection on observables of the unemployed. Assuming that
31:1181:92432:18:18:68:543:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unobservable factors that influence job search correlate with these observable characteristics,
31:1182:92527:18:18:68:284:400:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:these estimates convey useful information.

31:1194:93539:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dicted unemployment increases (unsurprisingly) throughout the spell, the overall relationship
31:1195:93632:18:18:68:543:167:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is quite flat: predicted unemployment only increases from 280 days to 295 days after around 2
31:1196:93725:18:18:68:543:149:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:years. Furthermore, the pattern of selection is not much affected by the UI benefit path. The
31:1197:93818:18:18:68:544:131:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:lines for the pre- and post-reform period are fairly parallel for most of the spell.39Selection
31:1198:93913:18:18:68:359:113:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:on observables thus plays only a limited role in the data.
31:1199:93971:18:15:77:543:95:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:39The fact that dynamic selection seems to be small and not much affected by the UI regime has been shown
31:1200:94076:15:0:68:259:80:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:before, for example Schmieder et al. (2016).
32:1201:94122:0:18:85:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:The selection over time in predicted duration has a counterpart in the structural models.
32:1202:94211:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:For each cost type, we compute the expected unemployment duration in the pre-reform period.
32:1203:94302:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:We then calculate the average expected duration for unemployed individuals who leave in a
32:1204:94391:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:given period according to the estimated models. The reference-dependent model (solid lines
32:1205:94481:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:in Figure 13) predicts that the type composition changes only in the first 90 days and not
32:1206:94571:17:18:68:543:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:by much; thus the expected unemployment duration line is quite flat and not so dissimilar
32:1207:94660:18:18:68:543:604:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:from what we observe empirically. The standard model with cost heterogeneity (Figure 13a))
32:1208:94750:18:18:68:543:586:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:instead displays a large amount of dynamic selection, with a large swing until 200 days, with no
32:1209:94846:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:corresponding evidence in the data. The predicted heterogeneity for the gamma-heterogeneity
32:1210:94937:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:model (Figure 13b)) is even more at odds with the data, with an initial swing, and then an
32:1211:95027:18:18:68:543:532:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:abrupt swing between 300 and 360 days, corresponding to the transition from the medium-
32:1212:95114:18:18:68:502:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to the high-elasticity type. There is no evidence of a corresponding shift in the data.
32:1213:95201:18:18:85:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:Thus, the pattern of dynamic selection implied by two versions of the standard model
32:1214:95285:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:appear at odds with the much more muted and monotonic selection in the data. We should
32:1215:95371:18:18:68:543:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:be clear that it is not surprising that the selection on observables be more muted than the
32:1216:95462:18:18:68:543:442:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:selection implied by the model, given that we only observe part of the selection. However,
32:1217:95552:18:18:68:543:424:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the extent of the difference is quite striking, given the rich set of variables used in calculating
32:1218:95651:18:18:68:543:406:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dynamic selection. Moreover, it is puzzling for the standard model that the observed selection
32:1219:95745:18:34:68:531:388:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:does not display any of the trends in the model predictions, even on a more muted scale.40

32:1221:95858:26:18:68:542:328:12:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f9:B:So far we take the reemployment wage as fixed so the unemployed accept every job offer.41
32:1222:95947:18:18:68:543:310:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:While this is consistent with a literature documenting a small role of reservation wages for job
32:1223:96043:18:18:68:543:292:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:search dynamics (e.g. Card et al., 2007a; Krueger and Mueller, 2013; Schmieder et al., 2016),
32:1224:96136:18:17:68:543:274:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:a natural question is whether introducing a reservation wage would change our conclusions.
32:1225:96226:17:18:68:543:257:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:For tractability, we estimate a reference-dependent model with choice of search effort and
32:1226:96316:18:18:68:543:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:reservation wage, but with hand-to-mouth consumers.  These results should be considered
32:1227:96403:18:18:68:505:221:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:only suggestive, as endogenizing consumption is important, as we documented above.
32:1228:96485:18:18:85:543:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:We reestimate the model incorporating job acceptance decisions, using additional moments
32:1229:96573:18:18:68:543:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:based on reemployment wages and solving by backward induction. In this expanded model,
32:1230:96659:18:15:77:543:167:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:40While the Altonji et al. (2005) procedure motivates this test, the parallel is imperfect.  Altonji et al.
32:1231:96766:15:12:68:543:152:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:(2005) infers the impact of unobservable variables on the the magnitude of an estimate, based on the impact
32:1232:96873:12:12:68:543:140:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:of the observables. In our case, we would like to infer the extent and the role of unobserved heterogeneity
32:1233:96980:12:12:68:543:128:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:in the structural model, based on the heterogeneity captured by observables. The underlying assumption of
32:1234:97085:12:12:68:543:116:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:our procedure is that the set of observable variables used in predicting dynamic selections are rich enough to
32:1235:97195:12:12:68:543:104:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:capture (part of) the dynamic selection if its there, and also that the time path of dynamic selection caused
32:1236:97304:12:9:68:362:92:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:by observables is similar to the one caused by unobserved factors. .
32:1237:97372:9:15:77:543:83:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:41In the baseline model there is a single reemployment wage for everyone, while in the models in Table 7,
32:1238:97477:15:0:68:519:68:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:Column (5) we allow for 3 different groups of workers, each facing a different fixed reemployment wage.
33:1239:97582:0:18:68:543:711:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:individuals draw job offers from a (stationary) log-normal wage offer distribution and decide
33:1240:97675:18:18:68:543:693:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:whether or not to accept it. For simplicity, we also abstract away from gain (or loss) utility
33:1241:97769:18:18:68:543:675:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:at reemployment. We set the standard deviation of the wage offer distribution at 0.5, close
33:1242:97860:18:18:68:543:657:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:to the standard deviation of the actual reemployment wages, and we estimate the mean of
33:1243:97947:18:17:68:543:639:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the wage offer distribution. As additional moments, we use the average reemployment wage
33:1244:98035:17:18:68:544:622:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:of individuals exiting unemployment in periodtafter entering the UI system, adding 70

33:1247:98256:18:18:68:543:568:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependent model has a better fit than the standard model (GOF of 272 versus 308), largely
33:1248:98345:18:18:68:543:550:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:due to the reference-dependent model providing a better fit for the hazard moments (see also

33:1250:98526:18:18:68:543:514:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:unlike the hand-to-mouth estimates in Table 2, have relatively patient unemployed workers,
33:1251:98616:18:18:68:543:496:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:at odds with the maintained assumption of hand-to-mouth consumption.  For the sake of
33:1252:98701:18:18:68:543:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:comparison, Columns (3) and (4) provide estimates of the hand-to-mouth models with no

33:1254:98851:36:30:68:244:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:6  Discussion and Conclusion
33:1255:98879:30:17:68:543:394:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:We provided evidence that a model with reference-dependent preferences can explain qual-
33:1256:98967:17:18:68:543:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:itative features of the hazards which plausible versions of the standard model have a hard
33:1257:99057:18:18:68:543:359:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:time fitting. The model itself builds on one of the most robust behavioral models, reference
33:1258:99149:18:18:68:543:341:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:dependence, and uses a natural candidate for a backward-looking reference point. We also
33:1259:99237:18:18:68:543:323:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:find that job seekers are substantially impatient, likely in the form of present-bias preferences.
33:1260:99335:18:18:85:543:305:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A:This evidence has policy implications. A key prediction of reference-dependent job search
33:1261:99424:18:18:68:543:287:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:is that step-wise benefit schedule can induce considerably more search than predicted by
33:1262:99512:18:18:68:543:269:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the standard job search models.  Moreover, if the social planner wants the job seekers to
33:1263:99601:18:18:68:543:251:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:search more than they do (e.g. because she uses a lower discount rate for welfare assessment
33:1264:99693:18:18:68:543:233:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:than that of the unemployed), then having benefit drops over the UI spell is likely to be an
33:1265:99785:18:18:68:543:215:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:inexpensive way to achieve that goal. In support of that, Lindner and Reizer (2015) show that
33:1266:99878:18:18:68:543:197:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:the Hungarian UI reform examined here did not just speed up exits to employment, but it was
33:1267:99969:18:18:68:543:179:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:revenue-neutral from the perspective of the government. Therefore, the evidence presented
33:1268:100058:18:17:68:473:161:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:B:here opens the door to potential redesigns in unemployment insurance policies.
33:1269:100136:17:16:77:543:144:7:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f11:F:42The reemployment wage moments are estimated as in Lindner and Reizer (2015), allowing for a linear
33:1270:100236:16:0:68:117:128:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f11:F:time trend.
