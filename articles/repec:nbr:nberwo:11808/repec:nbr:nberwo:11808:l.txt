2:31:1528:31:21:71:539:579:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Recent declines in job tenure have coincided with a shift away from traditional defined benefit (DB)
2:32:1628:21:22:71:539:558:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:pensions,  which  reward  long  tenure.  Recent  evidence  also  points  to  an  increase  in  job-to-job
2:33:1733:22:21:71:539:536:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:movements by workers, and we document gains in relative wages of job-to-job movers over a similar
2:34:1830:21:22:71:539:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:period.  We  develop  a  search  model  in  which  firms  may  offer  tenure-based  contracts  like  DB
2:35:1933:22:21:71:539:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:pensions to reduce the incidence of costly on-the-job search by workers. Reduced search costs can,
2:36:2031:21:29:71:528:472:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:under fairly general conditions, lower the value of deterring search and the use of DB pensions.

3:57:2527:0:33:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:58:2542:33:22:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Workers in the United States have experienced signiÖcant changes in both job tenure and the
3:59:2633:22:22:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structure of employer-provided pensions over the past twenty years.  Traditional deÖned beneÖt
3:60:2727:22:22:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(DB) pensions, which reward long tenure, have become steadily less common, while both actual
3:61:2819:22:22:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and expected job tenure have fallen over the same period.   The link between job tenure and
3:62:2910:22:22:72:540:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pension trends has not been closely examined but o§ers insights about both phenomena.  This
3:63:3001:22:22:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:paper investigates how on-the-job (OTJ) search by workers provides a motive for the use of deferred
3:64:3100:22:22:72:383:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:compensation and how that motive may have changed over time.
3:65:3160:22:22:88:539:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Spurred by evidence of a long-term increase in job-to-job mobility (Stewart [41]), we show that
3:66:3255:22:21:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these increased job-to-job áows have been associated with rising relative wages.  We develop a
3:67:3349:21:22:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model in which workers may search for new, more productive matches while on the job.  A key
3:68:3440:22:22:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:feature of the model is that both OTJ search and the resulting quits are costly to the Örm.  We
3:69:3535:22:22:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show conditions under which the Örm, to avoid this loss, might o§er a contract that dissuades
3:70:3628:22:22:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers from searching.  The contract takes the form of delayed compensation that is conditioned
3:71:3724:22:22:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the worker not quitting.  These contracts look much like DB pensions.  In a recent paper,
3:72:3816:22:22:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Friedberg and Owyang [13] (hereafter FO) argued that the value of long-term jobs has fallen,
3:73:3908:22:22:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:which has reduced expected job tenure and thus undermined the e§ectiveness of DB pensions at
3:74:4000:22:22:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:deterring moral hazard. This paper pursues a related line of research, incorporating a more realistic
3:75:4101:22:22:72:539:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:representation of job search and thus highlighting another change in the nature of long-term jobs.
3:76:4199:22:22:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In this framework, an increase in the gains from OTJ search caused by, for example, lower
3:77:4288:22:22:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search costs, results in more search, more quits, and consequently shorter job tenure, all of which
3:78:4387:22:22:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:undermines the incentive to o§er pensions.  Although a decline in search costs has a theoretically
3:79:4485:22:21:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ambiguous e§ect on relative wages of job-to-job movers in our model, our evidence that their
3:80:4577:21:22:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative wages have improved in recent years bolsters the premise that OTJ search has grown more
3:81:4673:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rewarding.  We emphasize an endogenous shift in the use of pensions in this paper, as opposed to
3:82:4769:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exogenous changes resulting from new government regulations that have been highlighted in the
3:83:4862:22:22:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pension literature.  Also, in contrast to FO where the decline in job tenure and DB pension use
3:84:4957:22:22:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results from an increase in endogenous match destruction, we consider the role played by increased
3:85:5055:22:0:72:348:84:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:voluntaryworker áows, which are involuntary to the Örm.
4:86:5111:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This paper draws on research in several areas.   The model is motivated by the empirical
4:87:5199:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:importance job-to-job áows by workers and the role they play in explaining the decline in job
4:88:5292:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tenure.  The paper also builds on an emerging literature that documents a variety of evidence
4:89:5385:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about reduced search costs.   Anecdotal reports suggest that search costs have dropped, most
4:90:5477:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:recently as use of the internet has expanded and over a longer period due to structural shifts in
4:91:5574:22:22:72:539:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the economy, some of them associated with thicker local labor markets.1In the search literature,
4:92:5670:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a reduction in search frictions is generally predicted to increase the productivity range over which
4:93:5770:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:agents search, thus raising job-to-job áows (Pissarides [34]) and reducing average job tenure.2The
4:94:5868:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:greater incentive to search diminishes the e§ectiveness of pensions in deterring search ñthus linking
4:95:5969:22:22:72:313:511:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:recent trends in job tenure and pension structure.3
4:96:6020:22:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This paper also extends the literature focusing on DB pensions as incentive contracts, building
4:97:6115:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on work by Lazear [25].  Notably, this paper complements other recent work incorporating tenure-
4:98:6211:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based contracts that deter OTJ search (Burdett and Coles [5], Stevens [39]). The essential similarity
4:99:6312:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of those two papers and ours is that a worker in a job may choose not to seek outside o§ers if the
4:100:6410:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Örm o§ers a rich enough incentive, for example by tying compensation to tenure, even though
4:101:6501:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:productivity need not rise with tenure.   The papers di§er in the details of search and match
4:102:6594:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:formation, which determine the particular costs and beneÖts of search. Both Stevens and Burdett
4:103:6689:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Coles assumed that Örms post wages for jobs in which productivity is known in advance and
4:104:6782:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers choose among jobs o§ering di§ering starting points on the tenure-based wage proÖle. Job
4:105:6877:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:o§ers arrive costlessly, but workers are less likely to quit the higher they are on the wage proÖle.
4:106:6977:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Firms face a tension between starting workers at a lower point on the wage proÖle and raising
4:107:7070:22:22:72:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:current proÖts, or at a higher point and raising retention rates and future proÖts.4In Stevens,
4:108:7165:22:16:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Örms post not a wage but a contract taking the form that all pay is deferred until a dateTagreed
4:109:7261:16:14:84:539:210:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:1For example, local labor markets are changing so that workers with given skills seem to have more Örms to match
4:110:7373:14:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:with in a particular location.  This is a consequence of trends like the shift into services and out of manufacturing,
4:111:7491:11:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:in which Örms tend to be local monopsonists; of rising urbanization and resulting agglomeration economies, either
4:112:7604:11:11:72:539:174:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:within or across industries[16]; and of reductions in communication and transportation costs, which increase the gain
4:113:7721:11:7:72:319:163:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:to decentralizing production (Gersbach and Schmutzler [15]).
4:114:7781:7:15:84:539:156:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:2If the matching function exhibits increasing returns to scale (Sato [36] reported evidence of this), then develop-

4:116:8000:7:15:84:539:134:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:3This emphasis complements recent papers that explore conditions under which reductions in search frictions

4:119:8236:7:15:84:539:101:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:4The starting point on the wage proÖle is heterogeneous across Örms since they di§er by size (as they can hire
4:120:8346:15:0:72:301:86:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:more than one worker) and by productivity (in Stevens).

5:122:8502:22:22:72:103:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages.
5:123:8508:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In comparison, our model simpliÖes some aspects of job markets in order to expand on others.
5:124:8600:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Instead of posted contracts for jobs with known productivity, we assume bargaining after risk-
5:125:8694:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neutral agents meet and get a permanent productivity draw.  That draw determines whether the
5:126:8786:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker accepts the match and, in addition, a pension contract to forgo OTJ search. In our case,
5:127:8881:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search is costly, which explains why (as in the real world) only some and not all workers search
5:128:8977:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:OTJ. We also assume that a Örm cannot post a vacancy while a worker occupies the job, and that
5:129:9071:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a Örm faces uncertainty in the value of future matches. The resulting costs of search borne by Örms
5:130:9170:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:motivate the Örms to discourage workers from searching. Compared to the papers by Burdett and
5:131:9263:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Coles and by Stevens, we o§er a more stylized contract. The contract consists of wages determined
5:132:9360:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by Nash bargaining, together with a lump-sum paid out to the worker in the event that a match
5:133:9453:22:21:72:315:445:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:ends exogenously but forfeited if the worker quits.5
5:134:9505:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Besides incorporating asymmetries in the costs and beneÖts of search, another key contribution
5:135:9599:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that we make is the analysis of changes in the economic environment that undermine tenure-based
5:136:9694:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contracts.  While the papers by Burdett and Coles and by Stevens concentrate on proving the
5:137:9785:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:existence of the tenure-based contract in the steady state, we emphasize the fragility of the contract
5:138:9887:22:22:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in response to plausible changes in the economic environment.  Our hypothesis of an endogenous
5:139:9981:22:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:motive for the shift in pension structure also contrasts with the pension literature that focuses on
5:140:10081:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exogenous changes in federal regulations.  The shift in emphasis here suggests the possibility that
5:141:10180:22:22:71:488:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:regulatory changesresponded toan underlying increase in the gains to worker mobility.
5:142:10265:22:22:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we discuss trends in private pension coverage,
5:143:10361:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job tenure, job-to-job áows, and job search costs. We also present evidence that wages of people
5:144:10457:22:22:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:moving job-to-job rose over time, relative to wages of both people staying in the same job and
5:145:10551:22:22:71:539:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:people starting a new job after a spell of unemployment.  In Section 3, we present the baseline
5:146:10646:22:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model with OTJ search.  In Section 4, we introduce the pension contract which may prevent OTJ
5:147:10739:21:22:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search.  In Section 5, we show how a reduction in the cost of OTJ search may reduce the value of
5:148:10835:22:16:71:389:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a job and hence render the pension contract.  Section 6 concludes.
5:149:10901:16:0:84:511:101:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:A:5We prove that such a contract are feasible, while the other papers proved that the contracts are optimal.

6:151:11053:33:22:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, we discuss trends in job tenure and private pensions.  We then present evidence
6:152:11149:22:22:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:developed by others about the incidence of on-the-job search and job-to-job áows, which are im-
6:153:11244:22:22:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:portant in magnitude, and about trends in search, job-to-job áows.  Lastly, we present data that
6:154:11340:22:38:72:442:610:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we have constructed analyzing wage changes associated with job-to-job áows.
6:155:11415:38:29:72:223:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.1  Trends in job tenure
6:156:11440:29:22:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Over the last 20 years, both actual and expected job tenure have fallen. Expected tenure data are
6:157:11537:22:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:noisier than actual tenure data but show a greater decline. Average current tenure of male full-time
6:158:11637:22:22:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employees in the Survey of Consumer Finances fell from 9.7 in 1983 to 8.8 years in 1998, while
6:159:11731:22:21:72:539:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected remaining tenure fell from 18.6 in 1983 and 16.2 in 1989 to 14.7 in 1998.6Changes in job

6:161:11925:22:22:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:secular declines in job tenure.  Average current tenure of female full-time employees rose from 7.4
6:162:12024:22:22:72:540:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:years in 1983 to 8.1 years in 1992 and then fell back to 7.3 in 1998, while expected remaining tenure
6:163:12125:22:22:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fell from 15.9 in 1983 to 12.5 in 1989, rose to 14.4 in 1992, and then fell to 12.8 in 1998.7Adding
6:164:12224:22:22:72:540:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:together current and expected remaining tenure yields subjective estimates of total expected job
6:165:12320:22:22:72:540:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:duration.  For men, total expected tenure fell from 27.3 years in 1983 to 24.6 years in 1989 and
6:166:12416:22:22:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:23.0 years in 1998, a 15.5% decline between 1983 and 1998 and a 6.3% decline between 1989 and
6:167:12509:22:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1998.  For women, expected tenure fell by 12.9% between 1983 and 1998 and by 10.3% between
6:168:12599:22:22:72:143:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1992 and 1998.
6:169:12613:22:22:88:539:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A decline in expected remaining job tenure may indicate either a greater willingness to change
6:170:12707:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:jobs or a greater fear of involuntary job loss.  We do not have evidence about whether the rate of
6:171:12805:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:voluntary quits has risen.  However, Farber [11] noted that the decline in job tenure in the CPS
6:172:12901:22:21:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was not matched by an increase in layo§s, indicating that increases in mobility are to some extent
6:173:12999:21:16:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:voluntary.  In any case, a perceived increase in the risk of involuntary job loss should induce more

6:179:13599:7:15:84:539:100:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:7The wording and organization of questions regarding future work plans was di§erent enough that the 1983 SCF

7:183:13809:29:22:72:540:642:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:At any given time, over half of all full-time workers in the U.S. have pension coverage in their
7:184:13905:22:22:72:539:620:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:current job, and a greater number have been in a job with a pension at some point.8Fundamental

7:186:14096:22:22:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:plans discourage mobility for many years after a worker starts a job, while DC plans are largely
7:187:14192:22:22:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tenure-neutral. The path of pension wealth accrual in a typical DB plan is characterized by sharp
7:188:14289:22:22:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spikes, as in Figure 1.9Allen, Clark, and McDermed [2] estimated that the pension loss associated
7:189:14386:22:22:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with switching jobs for the average worker with a DB plan aged 35-54 was approximately half a
7:190:14479:22:22:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:yearís earnings.  The smooth path of DC pension wealth accruals, which consist of contributions

7:192:14660:22:21:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Workers have experienced a major shift in pension coverage in the last twenty years.  Among
7:193:14751:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:full-time employees with a pension in the SCF, 69% had a DB plan and 45% had a DC plan in
7:194:14840:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1983, while 40% had a DB plan and 80% had a DC plan in 1998 (some have both types).  FO
7:195:14927:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrated that workers with DB pensions have longer current and expected total job tenure than
7:196:15024:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers with DC pensions or no pensions, and that the same workers are generally experiencing

7:198:15163:22:22:88:539:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In a series of papers summarized in [25], Lazear developed models in which employers structure

8:222:17215:29:22:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Data limitations severely hamper the measurement of job-to-job áows, on-the-job search, and search
8:223:17313:22:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:costs.  Nevertheless, U.S. data that has become available since the mid-1990s o§er several pieces
8:224:17410:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of relevant evidence.  First, job-to-job moves are relatively frequent.  Second, on-the-job search is
8:225:17511:22:38:72:537:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:common.  Third, search costs appear to be declining, as, for example, internet use has expanded.

8:227:17629:29:21:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In 1994, the Current Population Survey (CPS) started to ask people whether they were still working
8:228:17727:21:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the same employer as they had been a month earlier, which provided a much more accurate view
8:229:17823:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of job-to-job áows than was available before. Fallick and Fleischman [10] computed employment-to-
8:230:17920:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment áows in the 1994-2003 CPS. They found that an average of 2.6% of employed workers
8:231:18012:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changed employers each month, accounting for almost 40% of both job separations and new job
8:232:18103:22:22:72:539:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:starts ña major share of all labor market áows.10It remains di¢ cult at this point to distinguish
8:233:18200:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between cyclical characteristics and secular trends in the data, however. The magnitude of job-to-
8:234:18298:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job áows dipped from 1994 to 1996 and rose slowly from 1996 to 2000, then fell considerably from
8:235:18394:22:22:72:329:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2000 to 2003 during a time of labor market weakness.
8:236:18446:22:16:88:539:137:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Stewart [41],[42] recently developed a much longer series, though with a smaller sample size,
8:237:18539:16:15:80:539:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:10It should be kept in mind that this method will underestimate job-to-job áows.  The CPS follows residents of
8:238:18649:15:11:72:540:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the same address from month to month, rather than following the same individuals, so it misses job changes that
8:239:18760:11:0:72:191:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:involve a change of residence.
9:240:18791:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based on retrospective data from March CPSs.11Stewart [41] documented a substantial increase in
9:241:18886:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job-to-job áows (deÖned as occurring with two or fewer weeks of unemployment) from 1975 to 2000
9:242:18981:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of 59%. This was matched by a decline in job-to-unemployment áows, suggesting that workers are
9:243:19075:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increasingly better at searching while on-the-job.  While the series rose and then fell during the
9:244:19173:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1970s to roughly the same level in 1982, it then increased steadily afterwards, save for a dip during
9:245:19274:22:37:72:263:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the economic downturn of 1989 to 1991.
9:246:19312:37:29:72:208:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:2.3.2  On-the-job search
9:247:19336:29:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In February 1995, 1997, and 1999, the CPS asked questions designed to elicit information about on-
9:248:19434:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the-job search by workers. Meisenheimer and Ilg [28] tabulated data on active search by employed
9:249:19530:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage-and-salary workers.12They found that, in February 1999, 4.5% had actively looked for a new
9:250:19625:22:22:71:540:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job within the previous three months.13Fallick and Fleischman [10] linked information on search
9:251:19720:22:22:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in February 1997 and 1999 with job-to-job áows a month later and concluded that those who had
9:252:19813:22:22:71:539:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:actively searched for a job in the three months prior to February were much more likely to have
9:253:19908:22:22:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changed jobs (11.3% versus 2.1% for non-searchers) by March. Thus, on-the-job search is followed
9:254:20004:22:22:71:144:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by job changes.
9:255:20019:22:22:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Nevertheless, it appears that traditional survey methods do not capture all forms of job search.
9:256:20115:22:21:71:539:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Only about 1/5 of those who had moved from one job to another in March had actively looked for
9:257:20209:21:22:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a job earlier, according to Fallick and Fleischman.  A similarly low rate (about 1/3) of those who
9:258:20307:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:had started a new job in March after being out of work in February were classiÖed in February as
9:259:20403:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed, i.e. actively searching for a job.  There may be a few explanations for the apparent
9:260:20499:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:low rate of active job search among those subsequently starting new jobs:  contacts initiated by
9:261:20595:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:potential employers may not be reported as active search; active search may have only taken place
9:262:20692:22:22:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a few weeks immediately prior to starting a new job; and some new jobs resulting from active job
9:263:20788:22:14:71:447:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search are associated with residential moves and thus not followed in the CPS.
9:264:20866:14:15:80:539:168:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:11Fallick and Fleischman discussed the drawbacks of other attempts to use the CPS to develop longer series of
9:265:20975:15:11:72:539:153:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:worker áows. Kamborouv and Manovskii [21] noted the di¢ culty of identifyingoccupationalmobility using Stewartís
9:266:21087:11:10:71:539:142:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:method, arising because of high rates of error in occupational coding. We are not directly concerned with occupational
9:267:21205:10:8:71:140:132:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:mobility, though.
9:268:21222:8:14:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:12Active job search involves contacting an employer, employment agency, school employment center, or acquain-
9:269:21331:14:11:71:539:110:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:tances about a job; sending out resumes; Ölling out applications; checking union or professional registers; or placing
9:270:21449:11:8:71:493:99:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:or answering ads.  Passive job search involves reading the want-ads or attending a job training program.
9:271:21553:8:14:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:13The incidence of on-the-job search declined between 1995, when it was 5.6%, and 1999.  It is, again, impossible
9:272:21666:14:0:71:395:77:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:to distinguish between cyclical and secular shifts in behavior with a short series.
10:273:21750:0:29:72:271:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:2.3.3  Search costs and the internet
10:274:21786:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:While we have no data on long-term trends in search costs, many researchers have focused on the
10:275:21881:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reduced cost of conveying information brought about by the expansion of the internet since the
10:276:21975:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:early 1990s.  The incidence of internet search is high.  In the December 1998 CPS, Kuhn and
10:277:22066:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Skuterud [24] found that 7.1% of people with jobs, 15.9% of people with jobs and with internet
10:278:22160:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:access at home, and half of the unemployed with internet access at home used the internet for job
10:279:22257:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search. The rate of internet search by those with jobs exceeds earlier estimates of on-the-job search
10:280:22358:22:22:72:416:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using all other methods, as we noted above (Meisenheimer and Ilg [28]).
10:281:22429:22:22:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Moreover, there is growing evidence of an impact on labor markets.  It is many times cheaper
10:282:22521:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for Örms to post vacancy announcements on the internet than in newspapers (Autor [1]), and
10:283:22611:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:almost all major employers now accept online job applications (Freeman [12]).  These changes
10:284:22703:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may have subtler e§ects too; heterogeneity in the way jobseekers use the internet may explain
10:285:22796:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:simultaneous claims that individuals who use the internet are positively selected on unobservable
10:286:22893:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:qualities (according to internet search Örms cited in Kuhn and Skuterud [24]) or negatively selected
10:287:22993:22:22:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(a belief commonly held by employers, according to Autor).  Meanwhile, Autor suggested that
10:288:23084:22:22:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employers are increasingly using the internet to target employed ìpassive candidatesî; activity of
10:289:23182:22:22:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this type would help explain the increase in job-to-job áows together with the relatively low rate
10:290:23280:22:22:72:250:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of job search reported by job movers.
10:291:23317:22:22:88:539:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Two recent papers attempted to estimate the causal e§ect of internet search on labor market
10:292:23408:22:22:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes, but they were limited by the scope of the available data as well as the identiÖcation
10:293:23503:22:22:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strategies. Kuhn and Skuterud [24] focused on the unemployed. They found that, after controlling
10:294:23599:22:22:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for observable di§erences correlated with both internet use and shorter unemployment durations
10:295:23693:22:22:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(like education and previous occupation), the unemployed who used the internet for job search were
10:296:23791:22:22:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:neither more nor less likely to be employed a year later than other unemployed.  Estimates that
10:297:23886:22:22:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:attempted to control for unobservable di§erences suggested that those who used the internet may
10:298:23981:22:21:72:306:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have been less likely to be employed a year later.
10:299:24031:21:22:88:539:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Stevenson [40] documented some of the consequences of internet job search using an instrumental
10:300:24126:22:22:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variable strategy.  She focused on average internet penetration rates across U.S. states and found,
10:301:24225:22:0:72:540:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after instrumenting, several positive and statistically signiÖcant relationships.   In states with
11:302:24324:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:higher internet penetration, the unemployed used a greater number of types of search activities;
11:303:24420:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment-to-employment áows among more skilled workers rose; and interstate mobility rates of
11:304:24515:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:younger and more skilled individuals rose ñall evidence that the internet facilitates job search. As
11:305:24615:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Stevenson remarked, this is clearly an area that awaits further investigation in order to understand
11:306:24715:22:38:72:529:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:how to match theoretical concepts of job search with those that can be observed and measured.

11:308:24854:29:22:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Earlier, we discussed the new method developed by Stewart [41] that allows for a long-term investi-
11:309:24953:22:22:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gation of job-to-job áows. We have extended his method to study wages associated with job-to-job
11:310:25049:22:22:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:áows from 1983-2001.  While we cannot examine wage changes directly, we can compare hourly
11:311:25139:22:22:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages in a given March CPS for two groups of workers who have been continuously employed for
11:312:25231:22:22:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the last 14.5 months ñthose who experienced a job-to-job áow relative to those who stayed in the
11:313:25327:22:21:72:539:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same job continuously.14We make this comparison by running a regression in each yearís sam-
11:314:25418:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ple, putting log hourly earnings on the left-hand side and an indicator variable on the right-hand
11:315:25516:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:side for people experiencing a job-to-job áow within the last year, along with controls for gender,
11:316:25615:22:22:72:198:379:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:education, age, and race.15
11:317:25642:22:22:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our results are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The hourly wage of people in the CPS who experienced
11:318:25736:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a job-to-job áow is lower throughout than the hourly wage of people staying in the same job
11:319:25827:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:continuously. However, Figure 2 shows a major, steady, and statistically signiÖcant decline in this
11:320:25926:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative wage gap in the 1990s, with the gap closing from -17.6% in 1992 at the end of a recession
11:321:26024:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to -3.0% in 2001.  Because job-to-job áows are cyclical, we went further by regressing this relative
11:322:26124:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage gap for job changers on the contemporaneous unemployment rate, with the resulting residual

11:325:26412:22:16:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(from -15.7% in 1983 to -11.6% in 1990) and the 1990s (from -13.6% in 1993 to -10.4% in 2001),
11:326:26506:16:15:80:539:165:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:14We focus on almost the same sample as Stewart, as described in the Figure 2 notes.  We limit our focus to the
11:327:26617:15:11:72:540:150:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:CPS outgoing rotation groups, who reported data on current hourly earnings.  Our resulting sample is roughly 1/4
11:328:26729:11:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of the total available and ranges from 7,000-9,000 per year.  While we could try computing wage changes by getting
11:329:26843:11:11:72:540:128:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:hourly earnings data for the same people a year earlier, this would involve matching across CPSs and incurring
11:330:26953:11:7:72:337:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:substantial attrition that is probably correlated with job changes.
11:331:27020:7:15:80:539:110:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:15These demographic controls account for changes in wages due to changes in the composition of the labor force.
11:332:27131:15:11:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:The results were virtually the same when we allowed the coe¢ cients on the demographics to change from year to
11:333:27241:11:11:72:540:84:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:year; we report results when the covariates are held constant over the sample period.  The coe¢ cient on the relative
11:334:27358:11:0:72:487:73:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:wage of job-to-job movers is statistically signiÖcant every year, based on Huber-White standard errors.
12:335:27463:0:22:72:215:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:declining by one-third overall.
12:336:27494:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The CPS cannot be used to make a further comparison with people who changed jobs but
12:337:27578:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:experienced an intervening spell of unemployment.  Instead, we identify those who were in a job
12:338:27673:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in March and experienced any unemployment spell within the previous 14.5 months.16Then,
12:339:27760:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we compare current wages for those experiencing a job-to-job áow with those experiencing some
12:340:27853:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:kind of unemployment-to-job áow (without knowing whether the period began with a job or not).
12:341:27946:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We Önd that the job-to-job movers experienced relative wage gains on this front as well.  The
12:342:28039:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lighter line near the top of Figure 3 shows the di§erence between residual wages, after controlling
12:343:28138:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for demographics and then business cycle e§ects as above, of unemployment-to-job movers and of
12:344:28232:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job-to-job movers.  The relative wage gap for the unemployment-to-job movers rose from -4.2% in
12:345:28327:22:22:72:340:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1983 to -7.7% in 2001, relative to the job-to-job movers.
12:346:28384:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To sum up, we Önd that job-to-job movers experienced relative wage gains over the same period
12:347:28477:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in which job-to-job áows rose and DB pension use declined. The wage gap among those who moved
12:348:28570:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job-to-job within the previous 14.5 months narrowed signiÖcantly and substantially, compared to
12:349:28665:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:those staying in a job continuously.  Moreover, the wage gap compared to those in a job but with
12:350:28761:22:46:72:424:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an unemployment spell in the previous 14.5 months widened signiÖcantly.
12:351:28832:46:32:72:174:334:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:3  The Model
12:352:28844:32:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Spurred by evidence of a long-term increase in job-to-job áows and of gains in relative wages of job-
12:353:28945:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to-job movers, we develop a model in which workers may search for new, more productive matches
12:354:29039:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:while on the job. The framework we employ here is based on stochastic job matching models with
12:355:29133:22:22:72:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:incomplete contracting.17Our contribution is to incorporate áows to new jobs out of employment
12:356:29227:22:22:72:194:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as well as unemployment.
12:357:29251:22:22:88:539:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Deterring OTJ search o§ers a motive to defer compensation when Örms cannot directly con-
12:358:29339:22:22:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tract to prevent quits, although the willingness of agents to commit to long-term contracts depends
12:359:29438:22:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:crucially on the degree of uncertainty ñhence the importance of assuming stochastic match draws.
12:360:29534:16:15:80:539:132:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:16The problem is that we cannot distinguish those who began the period in a job, became unemployed, and then
12:361:29642:15:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:got a new job versus those who were unemployed at the outset and then got a job.  These two groups are probably
12:362:29753:11:7:72:174:106:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:somewhat heterogeneous.
12:363:29776:7:15:80:539:99:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:17The stochastic job matching framework builds on den Haan, Ramey, and Watson [8]. Few other models combine
12:364:29883:15:10:72:540:84:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:OTJ search and match-speciÖc productivity.  Our model of OTJ search is based on Mortensen [29] and Pissarides
12:365:29992:10:0:72:124:74:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:[33] and [34].
13:366:30008:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Because we are speciÖcally interested in this compensation, we will focus almost exclusively on cur-
13:367:30108:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rently employed workers (rather than the unemployed) as we discuss the model.  After developing
13:368:30203:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the model, we show how an increase in the expected gains from OTJ search undermine the pension
13:369:30297:22:38:72:118:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contracts.
13:370:30307:38:29:72:200:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.1  Basic framework
13:371:30327:29:22:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:The matching market.A unit mass of risk-neutral workers and a continuum of Örms search in
13:372:30416:22:22:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the labor market during a given period and match with probability-.18Workers searching in the
13:373:30509:22:22:71:539:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor market may be either employed (E) or unemployed (U). Workers searching while employed
13:374:30600:22:22:71:540:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:incur a search costc(Y), which is manifested as a reduction in output and increases with match
13:375:30694:22:22:71:539:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:productivity.  Firms, however, cannot search for a worker unless the position is vacant.  This
13:376:30788:22:22:71:539:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:assumption prevents the Örm from Öring a worker if it were to Önd a more productive one.  A
13:377:30879:22:21:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:newly matched worker and Örm receive a productivity drawY, which is drawn from a cumulative
13:378:30970:21:22:71:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution functionF(y)that is homogeneous for all new matches. They either commence pro-
13:379:31061:22:22:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:duction if the productivity draw exceeds a reservation value or re-enter the market to seek a new
13:380:31158:22:22:71:162:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:match next period.
13:381:31176:22:22:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:Separation  and  Search.Unlike some related models (see FO), we assume that a matchís
13:382:31261:22:22:71:539:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:productivity stays Öxed after it is initially drawn. We impose the alternative simplifying assumption
13:383:31362:22:22:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of exogenous layo§s in order to preserve our focus on quits. Thus, matches end because of one of
13:384:31458:22:34:71:135:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the following:
13:385:31472:34:22:88:540:257:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f4:A:-(Involuntary) Layo§. At the beginning of the period, an exogenous shock arrives with prob-
13:386:31563:22:22:99:540:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:ability-, independent of current match-speciÖc productivity. Layo§ shocks are idiosyncratic
13:387:31654:22:31:99:327:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:and generate the worker áow to unemployment.
13:388:31698:31:22:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f4:A:-(Voluntary) Quit.  If a worker searches OTJ and matches with a new Örm, the pair draws
13:389:31785:22:21:99:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:a new level of productivityY0.  If the new draw exceeds the workerís reservation productiv-
13:390:31876:21:22:99:540:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:ity, the new match is established and the old one destroyed.  Otherwise, the old match is
13:391:31965:22:17:99:539:117:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:preserved, and the worker and old Örm continue to produceY, less the cost of searchc(Y)>0.
13:392:32055:17:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:18For simplicity, we assume that the match probability is Öxed, instead of allowing it to vary with the vacancy and
13:393:32170:15:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:unemployment rate.  Thus, we ignore potential decreasing (increasing) returns to scale in the matching function,
13:394:32282:11:0:72:449:74:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:which would mitigate (magnify) the e§ects of an exogenous increase in the gains from search.
14:395:32376:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f12:A:If a layo§ occurs, the worker returns to unemployment and receives the outside optionbw
14:396:32463:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:representing unemployment beneÖts, home production, or leisure, while the Örm receives the outside
14:397:32561:22:22:72:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:optionbfand opens a vacancy.  In the event of a quit, the worker goes to the new job and the
14:398:32653:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Örm again receivesbfoutside option and opens a vacancy.  This leads to an asymmetry when the
14:399:32745:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker Önds a better match:  the Örm is indi§erent as to the cause of separation but the worker is
14:400:32843:22:22:72:247:599:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:better o§ with a quit than a layo§.19
14:401:32880:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:A:Division of Output.Workers and Örms bargain over the surplus of the match which is net
14:402:32966:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of search costs, with shares determined by bargaining weights. Thus, the worker receives a share
14:403:33062:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of current productivity-(Y)<Yif there is no search or-(Y-c(Y))<Y-c(Y)if the worker
14:404:33144:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searches OTJ. This leads to an additional asymmetry ñthe Örm bears part of the costs of search
14:405:33238:22:22:72:226:489:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:but enjoys none of its beneÖts.20
14:406:33271:22:22:88:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Output is allocated via the function-(Y), determined by Nash bargaining.21The Nash bar-
14:407:33358:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gaining solution maximizes the weighted product of the workerís and Örmís net surplus from the
14:408:33452:21:22:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job match, where a higher value of\r, the workerís bargaining weight, raises-(Y). Thus, the value
14:409:33549:22:22:72:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the match for each agent is determined by the split of current productivity-(Y).22The total
14:410:33643:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value of the match depends on both current output and the expected discounted stream of future
14:411:33737:22:38:72:127:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:production.
14:412:33748:38:29:72:204:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.2  The value of jobs
14:413:33770:29:22:72:539:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The productivity distribution can be divided into three regions.  For a productivity drawYabove
14:414:33865:22:22:72:539:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a thresholdY>R, an unemployed worker will accept the job.  If the draw exceeds some higher
14:415:33955:22:22:71:540:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thresholdY>R>R, the worker will not search after accepting the job.  In the intermediate
14:416:34043:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rangeR>Y>R, the worker will search after accepting the job and accepts any new o§er with a
14:417:34133:22:16:72:393:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:draw exceeding her reservation productivity, determined as follows.
14:418:34200:16:11:80:453:187:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:A:19We assume that the Örm cannot write a contract conditioned on the worker not searching.
14:419:34289:11:14:80:539:176:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:20Search is thus viewed as a substitute for e§ort at work. While the resulting moral hazard adds to the asymmetry
14:420:34402:14:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:in the costs and beneÖts of OTJ search, this assumption does not change the qualitative results.  In principle, we
14:421:34516:11:7:72:356:151:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:could impose some intermediate assumption about leisure-time search.
14:422:34584:7:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:21We assume that the workerís surplus is the di§erence between the value of the new match and unemployment
14:423:34690:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:regardless of the workerís current employment status. Shimer [37] analyzed how Nash bargaining di§ers when current
14:424:34804:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:productivity is the threat point.  In that case, the workerís share of output depends on her past productivities.  For
14:425:34922:11:7:72:272:107:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:tractability, we abstract from the possibility here.
14:426:34974:7:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:22From Pissarides [34], we know that the Nash bargaining allocative mechanism-(:)is continuous and di§erentiable
14:427:35086:15:0:72:146:85:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:and that-0(:)-0.
15:428:35104:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:If a workerís current productivity exceeds the search-deterring thresholdR, the cost of search

15:431:35394:22:44:72:364:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inY.  We compute the workerís value of a job in this case as

16:472:36524:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:share the surplus of the current job, but the worker (who can search OTJ) has access to better
16:473:36618:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:opportunities than the Örm, since the Örm loses a productive match in case of a quit and cannot
16:474:36713:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:post a vacancy before the quit.  Therefore, the value of the job to the worker versus the Örm
16:475:36806:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:diverges when the worker searches, compared to the value when the worker does not search.  It
16:476:36899:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is because of this asymmetry that the Örm might o§er a pension contract.  If the Örm can o§er a
16:477:36994:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contract which will prevent the worker from searching by, in e§ect, lowering the search-deterring
16:478:37091:22:37:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:threshold, then the Örm will neither share the costs of search nor face the loss resulting from a quit.
16:479:37194:37:29:72:217:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.3  The value of search
16:480:37218:29:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We next focus on determining the conditions under which workers search OTJ. A worker with a job
16:481:37313:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:yieldingYwill accept any new job with productivity drawY0such that its valueVw(Y0)>Vws(Y),
16:482:37403:22:22:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where the lack of the subscript on the left-hand side explicitly assumes the possibility of matching
16:483:37503:22:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to a search-deterring job. However, as we demonstrate shortly, any search-deterring job necessarily
16:484:37602:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:yields a higher valuation, so the job-to-job acceptance threshold is determined by a new job o§er
16:485:37699:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that would entail continued search.  The acceptance condition can be summarized in the following
16:486:37795:22:29:72:107:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lemma:

16:490:37992:29:22:88:539:255:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Since new matches are only formed with vacant jobs, Nash-bargaining of wages implies that the

16:494:38318:22:22:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:return from searching just equals the cost of search.   Consider a worker in a match currently

16:497:38525:15:14:80:539:86:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:23For tractability, we abstract away from conditions like an endogenous matching rate or endogenous job destruction
16:498:38640:14:0:72:537:72:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:as in FO. Such conditions would generate a wedge between the current productivity and the acceptance threshold.

17:530:39665:22:22:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker-history combinations, so the thresholds do not depend on the idiosyncratic match-speciÖc

17:532:39859:22:22:71:539:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the current productivity level. The workerís gain from search (5) reveals the workerís incentives
17:533:39959:22:22:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at varying levels of productivity and will play an important role in determining the existence of the

17:537:40207:22:22:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:losses from three sources.  Search itself costs the matchc(Y); output is lost when the Örm stands
17:538:40304:22:22:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:idle immediately after the worker departs; and the match with known productivity is replaced by an
17:539:40402:22:22:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:uncertain future draw. Consequently, the Örm is willing to compensate the worker for not searching
17:540:40500:22:22:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as long as the compensation does not exceed the gain to the Örm from deterring search. Similarly,
17:541:40597:22:21:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the worker is willing to accept the compensation as long as it exceeds the value of opportunities lost
17:542:40699:21:22:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from not searching. We demonstrate that the contract may fail to deter search in some matches,
17:543:40793:22:22:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:but it will deter search in relatively more productive matches in the rangeY<R, since the surplus
17:544:40890:22:0:72:303:79:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is high enough to make it worth forgoing search.

18:546:41037:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the worker, with the payment forfeited if the worker quits. This payment is made in addition to
18:547:41132:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the wages that continue to be determined by Nash bargaining.  Since we do not model retirement,
18:548:41227:22:22:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:we assume that workers get the payment in a lump-sum when the layo§ shock inevitably hits.24
18:549:41319:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Once we abstract away from the risk that the worker loses the pension because the match ends
18:550:41411:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unexpectedly early, then we can simply characterize the total value of the contract without saying
18:551:41509:22:38:72:376:577:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:more about its structure ñhow much is deferred for how long.25
18:552:41571:38:29:72:342:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.1  Will the Örm o§er the pension contract?
18:553:41615:29:22:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:A Örm may o§er a pension ñ a lump-sum payment at the end of the match that is forfeited if
18:554:41705:22:22:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the worker quits ñ for the purpose of preventing OTJ search.26The size of the pension a Örm
18:555:41796:22:22:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is willing to o§er depends on the gain if the worker does not search.   The maximum pension
18:556:41887:22:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:MP(Y)which the Örm in a match with output drawYwill o§er at the outset of the match is the
18:557:41977:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:di§erence between the value to the Örm of the same production level with and without search, so
18:558:42072:22:44:72:384:401:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:MP(Y) =Vfns(Y)-Vfs(Y).27Substituting (4) and (2), we have:
18:559:42130:44:33:145:540:357:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:A:MP(Y) =-(Y-c(Y)) +c(Y)--(Y) +\f(1--)[Vfns(Y)-Jfs(Y)];(6)
18:560:42186:33:22:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:where the Örst set of terms reáects the gain from avoiding search costs and the second set reáects
18:561:42284:22:16:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the gain from avoiding a vacancy.  Equation (6) represents one step toward demonstrating that
18:562:42377:16:15:80:539:286:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:24Figure 1 showed that DB pension accruals in the real world eventually turn negative after 20-30 years, encouraging
18:563:42493:15:11:72:540:271:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:retirement.  Since we do not include a retirement motive here, we ignore this aspect of DB pensions.  FO argued
18:564:42604:11:11:72:540:260:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:on several grounds that it is unlikely that an exogenous increase in optimal retirement ages caused the decline in DB
18:565:42721:11:7:72:121:249:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:pension use.
18:566:42733:7:15:80:539:242:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:25FO and Stevens [39] elaborated on the tension that arises in a risky environment between the promised pension
18:567:42844:15:11:72:540:227:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:beneÖt and the pensionís termination date.  If we extended our model so that the pension were forfeited by any early
18:568:42960:11:11:72:540:216:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:end to the match, even involuntary, it would not change the qualitative predictions of the model but would further
18:569:43074:11:11:72:540:205:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:narrow the productivity range deÖning a feasible contract (since relatively unproductive matches would not Önance
18:570:43187:11:11:72:540:194:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:a large enough deferred payment to get the worker to accept the early termination risk).  In Burdett and Coles [5],
18:571:43302:11:11:72:540:183:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:risk-averse workers prefer upfront pay in order to smooth consumption, which in our model would again narrow the
18:572:43414:11:10:72:540:172:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:productivity range over which pensions are feasible.  Lastly, we ignore the possibility that the Örm breaches the
18:573:43527:10:11:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:pension contract.  DB pensions are partially insured, and in addition, there is little empirical evidence of obvious
18:574:43643:11:8:72:160:151:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:breach by employers .
18:575:43664:8:14:80:539:143:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:26Our pension is also similar in áavor to the e¢ ciency wage of Shimer [38], which transfers a portion of output
18:576:43776:14:8:72:258:129:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:from the Örm to the worker to prevent search.
18:577:43821:8:14:80:540:121:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:27Once the Örm promises a pensionP(Y)at the outset, it no longer has to set aside any additional funds because
18:578:43931:14:11:72:539:107:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the problem is stationary and the initial amountP(Y)will continue to deter search.  Theex postgain to the Örm
18:579:44040:11:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:from deterring search will almost certainly di§er fromP(Y), depending on when the layo§ shock-occurs.  We may
18:580:44149:11:0:72:398:85:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:assume that an insurance market eliminates the risk of early or late termination.
19:581:44232:0:53:72:464:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the pension contract is feasible.  The following proposition lays out the next step:
19:582:44316:53:22:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:F:Proposition 3A Firmís Gain from Deterring OTJ Search.For all productivity levels in

19:584:44422:30:22:88:539:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The proposition shows that the Örm always beneÖts from deterring OTJ search.  This occurs
19:585:44511:22:22:71:539:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:because the Örm bears some of the costs of search but receives none of the beneÖts.  Moreover,
19:586:44605:22:22:71:540:560:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the maximum value of the pensionMP(Y)rises monotonically withY, since higher productivity
19:587:44694:22:37:72:478:538:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:matches have increasing value over a new match and since search costs rise withY.28

19:589:44826:29:22:71:539:472:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:While (6) reveals the Örmís willingness to sacriÖce some of its surplus to deter the worker from

19:591:45017:22:22:71:540:428:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in (5).  The resulting pension is incentive-compatible if the maximum valueMP(Y)that the Örm
19:592:45109:22:22:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is willing to o§er exceedsGS(Y)and, thus, prevents the worker from searching.  Therefore, the
19:593:45202:22:48:72:342:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value of the o§ered (and accepted) pensionP(Y)will be

19:605:45683:22:22:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Örm voluntarily reallocates a portion of its share of output in order to avoid productivity losses

19:610:46158:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:model workers and Örms share search costs. Second, Örms in our model do not know what match-speciÖc productivity
19:611:46270:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:they will draw next, whereas Pissarides assumed that Örms always match at the highest level of productivity. Finally,
19:612:46387:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:Örms in Pissaridesímodel open vacancies until their value is equal to zero, whereas in our model a continuum of Örms
19:613:46503:11:0:72:313:71:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:exist and have vacancies only when they are not producing.

20:615:46636:22:34:72:178:687:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:exists someP(Y)>0.
20:616:46654:34:22:88:539:653:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This proposition shows, and Figure 4 illustrates, that over at least some portion of the relevant

20:618:46840:22:22:71:540:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 4,GS(Y)falls withYand deÖnesRat the point whereGS(Y) = 0, whileMP(Y)is positive
20:619:46926:22:22:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and rises withY.  The pension will consequently be e§ective atY=R--, sinceGS(R) = 0and
20:620:47012:22:22:72:132:565:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:MP(R)>0.
20:621:47020:22:22:88:539:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:However, as Figure 4 demonstrates, it is possible that in some matches OTJ search cannot be
20:622:47111:22:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discouraged by pensions.  While Örms want to eliminate search at all productivity levels (since
20:623:47206:22:22:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:MP(Y)>0), there may be some values ofYsuch that the workerís incentives cannot be changed
20:624:47295:22:22:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for less than the Örm will sacriÖce. If pensions are infeasible in some matches, it would be in the
20:625:47394:22:21:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lowest productivity matches with OTJ search, i.e. over some range ofYbeginning atY=R. This
20:626:47484:21:22:72:539:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:occurs in Figure 4, sinceGS(Y)andMP(Y)intersect at a value ofY>R.  We denote this value
20:627:47571:22:22:72:539:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:asRP, deÖned as the reservation productivity level which, if it lies betweenRandR, renders the
20:628:47665:22:22:72:539:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pension contract infeasible for matches withY<RP. It is likely that the thresholdRPis relevant
20:629:47759:22:22:72:519:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the real world, since we observe that DB pensions are much less common in low-wage jobs.
20:630:47850:22:22:88:539:346:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f10:A:To sum up, pension contracts exist in medium-productivity jobs (matches withR>Y>RP-
20:631:47933:22:22:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:R) and not in the highest-productivity search-deterring jobs (withY>R).29Moreover, as Figure
20:632:48025:22:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:4 shows, the pension beneÖt might not be e§ective in the lowest productivity jobs (nearR).  We
20:633:48119:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cannot further characterize the level ofRP2(R;R)at which the Örm would be just indi§erent
20:634:48208:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between o§ering a pension that deters search or not without assuming a particular distribution of
20:635:48305:22:22:72:133:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:productivity.
20:636:48318:22:22:88:539:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While these pension contracts enhance the value of the current job, they may raise or lower
20:637:48409:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:aggregate welfare.  On the one hand, pension contracts reduce excessive OTJ search arising from
20:638:48504:22:21:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the asymmetry in how its costs and beneÖts are distributed.  On the other hand, though, new
20:639:48595:21:16:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:matches that dominate current ones are not formed.  Welfare considerations depend on speciÖc

20:641:48795:15:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:workers have higher marginal tax rates and higher saving rates; these motivations are not contract-theoretic and lie

21:651:49615:22:22:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Suppose that search costs uniformly decrease fromc0(Y)toc1(Y)-c0(Y)8Y.  This alters the
21:652:49702:22:22:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workerís gains from searchGS(Y)and the Örmís maximum pension o§erMP(Y), and in turn the
21:653:49789:22:22:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value of the pensionP(Y)and possibly the threshold of productivityRPat which the pension
21:654:49877:22:22:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is rendered incentive-incompatible.  To summarize the consequences for the match, we o§er the
21:655:49970:22:29:72:175:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:following proposition:
21:656:49992:29:22:72:539:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:F:Proposition 5Decrease in Search Costs.  Given a productivity distributionF(y)and the Öxed
21:657:50081:22:22:72:539:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:F:allocative mechanism-(y), a decrease in search costs causes (i) an increase in the search-preventing
21:658:50181:22:22:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:F:thresholdR, (ii) an increase in the workerís gains from searchGS(Y), and (iii) a decrease in the
21:659:50277:22:29:72:283:317:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:Örmís gains from preventing searchMP(Y).
21:660:50317:29:22:88:539:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f9:A:These e§ects are illustrated in Figure 5 and arise because both-(Y-c1(Y))>-(Y-c0(Y))
21:661:50401:22:22:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:andY-c1(Y)>Y-c0(Y).31Because the worker gets to keep more of current output in the event
21:662:50489:22:22:72:539:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of search, it boosts the gains from searchGS(Y), deÖned in (5).  That in turn raises the search
21:663:50584:22:22:72:539:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:threshold fromR0computed from search costsc0(Y)toR1computed from search costsc1(Y).
21:664:50667:22:22:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Therefore, in the absence of pension contracts, some workers previously satisÖed withYwill begin
21:665:50763:22:22:71:117:178:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to search.
21:666:50773:22:22:88:539:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:These changes will clearly ináuence the viability and size of the pension contract. The increase
21:667:50869:22:15:71:540:134:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inGS(Y)makes it more costly for Örms to discourage search.  Also, because the Örm gets to keep
21:668:50963:15:14:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:30In a very di§erent model than ours, Nagyp·l [30] investigated the aggregate welfare consequences of employment
21:669:51075:14:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:protection policies that raise the cost of dismissal when there is learning in matches.   She studied ine¢ ciencies
21:670:51190:11:8:72:537:94:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:generated by the use of legal employment protection to prevent layo§s, while we study pensions that prevent quits.
21:671:51304:8:14:80:540:86:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:31Note that there may be enough workers withR1>Y>R0such that total output net of search costs decreases
21:672:51407:14:0:72:159:72:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:rather than increases.
22:673:51431:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more of current output in the event of search, it reduces the gain from preventing search and hence
22:674:51530:22:22:72:432:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the maximum pensionMP(Y)the Örm is willing to o§er, as deÖned in (6).
22:675:51599:22:22:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We argue that under realistic parameters the pension-feasible region will probably shrink as a
22:676:51693:22:22:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:result, and hence the total number of pensions o§ered in the economy will decrease while the number
22:677:51792:22:22:71:539:621:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of workers who search will increase ñas has been observed in recent years.32The ambiguity arises
22:678:51888:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:because of two countervailing e§ects.  The pension-feasible region may get squeezed at the lower
22:679:51984:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:end while expanding at the upper end, so the actual outcome depends primarily on the density of
22:680:52079:22:22:72:539:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the productivity distribution in di§erent regions.  On the one hand,RPmay increase, so pensions
22:681:52174:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in some of the less productive matches in which search used to be deterred are no longer feasible.
22:682:52272:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This will deÖnitely happen if it was already the case thatRP>R, as in Figure 5, so pensions were
22:683:52368:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:failing to deter some OTJ search.  We already argued that this is likely to be the case.  If there is
22:684:52469:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a great deal of density in the region over whichRPrises, then even a small decrease in search costs
22:685:52568:22:21:72:533:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:could cause a large decrease in the use of pension contracts and an associated increase in search.
22:686:52666:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:On the other hand, the pension-feasible region gets expanded from above, as the search-deterring
22:687:52762:22:22:72:539:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thresholdRrises.  In the matches in which search is now attractive but was not before,GS(Y)is
22:688:52855:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:small relative toMP(Y), so Örms will begin to o§er pensions.  However, unless the productivity
22:689:52949:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:distribution is skewed strongly to the right and therefore the mass of matches without search is
22:690:53045:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large (which seems unlikely, or else OTJ search and job-to-job áows would be very uncommon),
22:691:53137:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:then the Örst e§ect (the squeeze from below) will dominate the second (the expansion from above),
22:692:53234:22:22:72:272:292:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:and the number of pensions will decline.33
22:693:53276:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:It should be noted that the e§ect of a decrease in the cost of search is robust to other speciÖca-
22:694:53374:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions of search costs. If search costs are borne entirely by the worker, then a decrease induces more
22:695:53475:22:22:72:539:226:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search becauseGS(Y)rises and the incentive-compatibility constraint binds for more matches, with
22:696:53571:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:no increased funding for pensions to counteract the e§ect.  If search costs are borne entirely by
22:697:53668:22:22:72:539:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the Örm, then a decrease induces more search becauseMP(Y)falls as search becomes less costly
22:698:53760:22:15:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the Örm, so fewer pensions will be o§ered.  The same e§ects occur whether search costs are a
22:699:53856:15:15:80:539:145:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:32The economy will immediately enter a new steady state like this one if existing pensions contracts are renegotiated.
22:700:53974:15:11:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:If not, then all existing pensions will be too small to deter search and will be abandoned, and the economy will reach
22:701:54092:11:7:72:383:119:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:the new steady state after workers reshu≠ e into new jobs with new pensions.
22:702:54168:7:15:80:540:112:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:33It is also likely that the average value of remaining pensions will change, depending on the density ofYand on
22:703:54280:15:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:other parameters. At the lower end, the largest pensions will disappear but remaining pensions will get bigger; while
22:704:54397:11:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:at the upper end, the new pensions that appear will be small. Evidence in FO suggests that remaining DB pensions
22:705:54509:11:0:72:227:75:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:are becoming less valuable on average.
23:706:54549:0:22:72:276:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function of productivityYor are constant.
23:707:54590:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, our model implies that the number of pensions is likely to fall when the costs of OTJ
23:708:54681:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search decline.  Earlier, we discussed evidence of such a decline, so our results may help explain
23:709:54779:22:46:72:322:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the recent decline in job tenure and in DB pensions.

23:711:54845:32:22:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In the midst of the economic boom of the 1990s, the New York Times suggested that ìthe no-
23:712:54935:22:22:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tion of lifetime employment has come to seem as dated as soda jerks, or tail Önsî (Kolbert and
23:713:55029:22:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Clymer [22]).34While many media reports have highlighted the supposed decline in job stability,
23:714:55124:22:22:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economists have only recently found conÖrmation that job tenure has declined, while over a similar
23:715:55222:22:22:71:315:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:period job-to-job áows have increased in frequency.
23:716:55273:22:22:88:539:455:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In this paper we propose a model of on-the-job search and job-to-job áows to help explain these
23:717:55368:22:22:71:539:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes.  Recent data makes it clear that these activities occur commonly, yet they are actively
23:718:55464:22:22:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discouraged by DB pensions.  The decline in the use of DB pensions suggests an important link
23:719:55557:22:22:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with trends in tenure and job-to-job áows. Other recent theoretical papers have also tied together
23:720:55655:22:22:71:539:367:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the motive to search on-the-job with the use of tenure-based deferred compensation contracts. We
23:721:55751:22:22:71:539:345:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:propose a model with some distinct features that add to our understanding of the costs and beneÖts
23:722:55849:22:21:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of on-the-job search and, consequently, the feasibility of tenure-based contracts. Then, we highlight
23:723:55950:21:22:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes in the expected value of search that can explain the declining use of such contracts.  We
23:724:56047:22:22:71:539:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:focus on a decline in search costs which, under fairly general conditions, would reduce the use of
23:725:56145:22:22:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:DB pensions and boost worker mobility.  A jump in the expected gains from search tallies with
23:726:56238:22:22:71:334:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed growth in relative wages of job-to-job movers.

23:729:56480:22:22:71:539:170:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:careful evaluation of the welfare consequences for workers and Örms.   Such an analysis might
23:730:56573:22:22:71:539:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reveal that DB pensions have become socially ine¢ cient, even if they remain privately e¢ cient.
23:731:56669:22:22:71:539:126:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In our model, pensions internalize the costs and beneÖts of search within the match but impede

31:1035:67281:11:12:90:508:381:100:Times:100:Times:A:(1) We used the method described in Stewart (2002, 2005) to identify people in March CPSs from 1983-
31:1036:67381:12:11:90:489:369:100:Times:100:Times:A:2001 who had moved job-to-job (with an intervening unemployment spell of 0-2 weeks) within the 
31:1037:67476:11:12:90:503:358:100:Times:100:Times:A:previous 14.5 months, versus those who had stayed in the same job continuously.  We used the sample 
31:1038:67576:12:11:90:491:346:100:Times:100:Times:A:selection criteria from Stewart (workers aged 19-55, with at least one year of potential labor market 
31:1039:67677:11:12:90:510:335:100:Times:100:Times:A:experience, who are not currently and were not self-employed in the previous year, and who worked full-
31:1040:67780:12:11:90:511:323:100:Times:100:Times:A:time in the previous year) but limited the sample to people in the outgoing rotation groups, for whom the 
31:1041:67886:11:12:90:506:312:100:Times:100:Times:A:CPS collected data on current hourly earnings.  Our resulting sample ranges from 7,000-9,000 per year. 
31:1042:67989:12:11:90:93:300:100:Times:100:Times:A: 
31:1043:67989:11:12:90:523:289:100:Times:100:Times:A:(2) We ran a regression on each year’s sample, putting log hourly earnings on the left-hand side and putting 
31:1044:68098:12:11:90:514:277:100:Times:100:Times:A:an indicator variable on the right-hand side for people experiencing a job-to-job flow, along with controls 
31:1045:68206:11:12:90:515:266:100:Times:100:Times:A:for gender, education (did not finish high school, high school diploma, attended but did not finish college, 
31:1046:68315:12:11:90:519:254:100:Times:100:Times:A:finished a college degree), age (and its square), and race (white, black, other).  We computed Huber-White 
31:1047:68422:11:12:90:262:243:100:Times:100:Times:A:standard errors and used earnings weights.

31:1049:68465:11:12:90:517:220:100:Times:100:Times:A:(3) Figure 2 reports the coefficient estimates on the indicator variable for people experiencing a job-to-job

32:1066:69001:12:11:90:519:372:100:Times:100:Times:A:(4)  We took the coefficient estimates reported in Figure 2, which show the percentage difference in wages 
32:1067:69108:11:12:90:499:361:100:Times:100:Times:A:each year for job-to-job movers compared to job stayers, and regressed them on the contemporaneous 
32:1068:69206:12:11:90:517:349:100:Times:100:Times:A:unemployment rate in order to remove business cycle effects.  The residuals are shown as the heavy lower 
32:1069:69311:11:12:90:516:338:100:Times:100:Times:A:line in Figure 3.  Thus, it shows the percentage difference in wages for job-to-job movers compared to job 
32:1070:69418:12:11:90:364:326:100:Times:100:Times:A:stayers, controlling for demographics and for business cycle effects. 
32:1071:69488:11:12:90:93:315:100:Times:100:Times:A: 
32:1072:69488:12:11:90:506:303:100:Times:100:Times:A:(5)  Next, we adapted Stewart’s method to identify people in March CPSs who had moved to a new job 
32:1073:69587:11:12:90:515:292:100:Times:100:Times:A:within the previous 14.5 months and had experienced a spell of unemployment lasting more than 2 weeks 
32:1074:69689:12:11:90:520:280:100:Times:100:Times:A:(which may have occurred at any time during the previous 14.5 months).  We ran a similar regression as in 
32:1075:69795:11:12:90:517:269:100:Times:100:Times:A:(2) above, putting log hourly earnings on the left-hand side and now putting two indicator variables on the 
32:1076:69903:12:11:90:488:257:100:Times:100:Times:A:right-hand side – one for people experiencing a job-to-job flow and one for people experiencing an 
32:1077:70002:11:12:90:473:246:100:Times:100:Times:A:unemployment-to-job flow – along with the same controls for gender, education, age, and race. 
32:1078:70096:12:11:90:93:234:100:Times:100:Times:A: 
32:1079:70096:11:12:90:507:223:100:Times:100:Times:A:(6)  The regressions yielded two coefficient estimates of interest, the percentage difference in wages for 
32:1080:70203:12:11:90:515:211:100:Times:100:Times:A:job-to-movers compared to job stayers and for unemployment-to-job movers compared to job stayers.  As 
32:1081:70305:11:12:90:521:200:100:Times:100:Times:A:in (4) above, we regressed the coefficient estimates on the contemporaneous unemployment rate in order to 
32:1082:70411:12:11:90:512:188:100:Times:100:Times:A:remove business cycle effects.  The difference between these residuals is shown as the light upper line in 
32:1083:70517:11:12:90:521:177:100:Times:100:Times:A:Figure 3.  Thus, it shows the percentage difference in wages for unemployment-to-job movers compared to
