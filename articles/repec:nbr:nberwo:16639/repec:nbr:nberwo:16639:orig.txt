2:39:2492:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We model spatial clusters of similar firms. Our model highlights how agglomerative forces lead to
2:40:2589:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:localized, individual connections among firms, while interaction costs generate a defined distance
2:41:2687:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:over which attraction forces operate. Overlapping firm interactions yield agglomeration clusters that
2:42:2788:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are much larger than the underlying agglomerative forces themselves. Empirically, we demonstrate
2:43:2884:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that our model's assumptions are present in the structure of technology and labor flows within Silicon
2:44:2986:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Valley and its surrounding areas. Our model further identifies how the lengths over which agglomerative
2:45:3089:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:forces operate influence the shapes and sizes of industrial clusters; we confirm these predictions using
2:46:3193:14:42:72:411:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:variations across both technology clusters and industry agglomeration.

3:60:3466:0:28:69:205:699:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:61:3481:28:17:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Agglomerationó industrial clusteringó is a key feature of economic geography. Starting with
3:62:3572:17:17:69:557:654:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshall (1920), a large and diverse literature studies why similar Örms often collocate. One
3:63:3665:17:17:69:557:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:body of work provides formal theoretical models of di§erent agglomerative forces like technology
3:64:3761:17:17:69:557:620:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sharing or labor pooling among Örms. A second literature measures interactions among Örms
3:65:3850:17:17:69:557:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and/or workers directly (e.g., worker moves across Örms, patent citation distances). A third
3:66:3942:17:17:69:557:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:literature characterizes di§erences in clustering behavior across industries (e.g., relating R&D
3:67:4038:17:17:69:557:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:intensity to greater spatial concentration). Despite this progress, we have very little understand-
3:68:4137:17:17:69:557:552:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing of the actual connection between micro-level interactions and observed cluster shapes and
3:69:4230:17:17:69:167:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sizes for industries.
3:70:4251:17:17:86:556:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This is very worrisome because studies frequently use observed spatial concentrations for
3:71:4340:17:17:69:557:501:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industries to infer the properties of the underlying forces that cause them. Economists often
3:72:4433:17:17:69:557:484:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:infer that technology spillovers are shorter than labor pooling spillovers because patenting Örms
3:73:4530:17:17:69:557:467:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are relatively more concentrated at the county level than are Örms that use similar types of
3:74:4622:17:17:69:557:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:workers.  Such reasoning, however, clashes with studies which have concluded that spillover
3:75:4713:17:17:69:557:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:e§ects are orders of magnitude stronger over the Örst few city blocks than they are when Örms
3:76:4806:17:17:69:557:416:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are between two and Öve miles apart (e.g., Rosenthal and Strange 2003, 2008, Arzaghi and
3:77:4894:17:17:69:557:399:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Henderson 2008). Many studies Önd that knowledge áows decrease sharply across áoors within
3:78:4984:17:18:69:557:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a single building. Why would we believe that we can infer useful information about knowledge
3:79:5076:18:17:69:557:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spillovers from the number of patents in a county, when a county averages over 75,000 people in
3:80:5171:17:17:69:130:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:population?
3:81:5182:17:17:86:556:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This project examines these issues theoretically and empirically. The core of our work is a
3:82:5273:17:17:69:557:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:location choice model that connects limited, localized agglomerative forces with the formation
3:83:5367:17:17:69:557:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of spatial clusters for similar Örms. Agglomerative forces in our model are localized because
3:84:5460:17:17:69:557:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örms face interaction costs. Spillover beneÖts exceed these interaction costs at short distances,
3:85:5557:17:17:69:557:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but beyond some distance interaction becomes unproÖtable. For example: while a Örm could
3:86:5645:17:17:69:557:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:learn useful technologies from another Örm 20 miles away, the costs of doing so may be too
3:87:5735:17:17:69:557:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:great to justify the e§ort. Clusters are then the product of many small, overlapping regions of
3:88:5830:17:17:69:127:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interaction.
3:89:5842:17:17:86:556:194:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Silicon Valley is the worldís most famous cluster, and many observers credit its success to
3:90:5933:17:17:69:557:177:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:either technology spillovers or labor pooling. Figures 1a and 1b identify the foundations of our
3:91:6029:17:17:69:557:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:theoretical framework using technology and labor áows, respectively, in the San Francisco Bay
3:92:6122:17:17:69:557:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Area. Figure 1a focuses on technology sourcing in an area surrounding Silicon Valley. Downtown
3:93:6216:17:17:69:557:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:San Francisco and Oakland are to the north and o§ of the map. The triangle in the bottom
3:94:6304:17:17:69:557:109:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:right corner of the map is the core of Silicon Valley. This core contains 76% of industrial patents
3:95:6403:17:17:69:539:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Öled from the San Francisco Bay Area and 18 of the top 25 zip codes in terms of patenting.
3:96:6493:17:0:86:556:75:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To introduce our model, we describe the primary technology sourcing zones for three of the
4:97:6584:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:four largest zip codes for patenting outside of the core. Each focal zip code is marked with a
4:98:6678:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:star, and the other points of the shape are the three zip codes that Örms in the focal zip code
4:99:6773:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cite most in their work. The orange zone (also labelled with a ì1î) for Menlo Park extends
4:100:6863:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:deepest into the core. The green zone for Redwood City (ì2î) shifts up and encompasses Menlo
4:101:6955:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Park and Palo Alto but less of the core. The black zone for South San Francisco (ì3î) further
4:102:7048:17:17:69:230:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:shifts out and brushes the core.
4:103:7080:17:17:86:556:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These technology zones are characterized by small, overlapping regions. None of the technol-
4:104:7172:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ogy sourcing zones transverse the whole core, much less the whole cluster, and only the closest
4:105:7267:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:zip code (Menlo Park) even reaches far enough into the core to include the area of Silicon Valley
4:106:7364:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:where the greatest number of patents occur. The empirical appendix contains additional maps
4:107:7455:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that show these small, overlapping regions are also evident in the core itself and in other parts
4:108:7552:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the San Francisco region.  While technology sourcing for individual Örms is localized, the
4:109:7645:17:17:69:348:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:resulting cluster extends over a larger expanse of land.
4:110:7701:17:17:86:556:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These properties are also evident in labor áows. Figure 1b describes commuting zones for
4:111:7789:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:scientists and engineers from the 2000 Census of Populations. Zones on the map are approxi-
4:112:7880:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mations, computed from Public Use Micro Area (PUMA) designations. The colored asterisks
4:113:7967:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:indicate locations of work. The zones surrounding the asterisks of similar color indicate the pri-
4:114:8065:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mary PUMAs of residence for the workers. Labor zones are more uniform in direction, with the
4:115:8157:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:star for the work PUMA typically nearer to the center of its labor zone. These labor commuting
4:116:8251:17:17:69:523:376:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:regions again display small, overlapping zones that in turn encompass a large land area.1
4:117:8340:17:17:86:556:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The central construct of our model replicates these features. Our model thus makes explicit
4:118:8431:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that empirical observation of cluster size in the data does not indicate the length of the micro-
4:119:8528:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interactions that produce the cluster. We show, however, that cluster shape and size does depend
4:120:8624:17:17:69:557:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:systematically on whether the localized interactions for Örms in an industry are longer or shorter
4:121:8722:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in length. We demonstrate that a longer e§ective spillover region, either due to weaker decay
4:122:8815:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in beneÖts or lower interaction costs, yields a macro-structure with fewer, larger, and less-dense
4:123:8913:17:17:69:557:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters. These regularities allow researchers to use cluster dimensions to rank order spillover
4:124:9009:17:17:69:360:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lengths even though micro-interactions are not observed.
4:125:9065:17:17:86:556:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:After deriving these predictions, we empirically test the model in two ways. We Örst use

4:127:9247:17:17:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure e§ective spillover regions by technology. Di§erences in these spillover regions relate to
4:128:9344:17:17:69:557:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cluster shapes and sizes as predicted by the model. Technologies with very short distances over
4:129:9439:17:17:69:557:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which Örms interact exhibit clusters that are smaller and denser than technologies that allow for
4:130:9536:17:17:69:154:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:longer distances.
4:131:9553:17:17:86:556:121:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We then use US Census Bureau data on spatial concentration patterns throughout all sectors
4:132:9643:17:17:69:557:104:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the economy. We show that industries with concentrated labor requirements, for whom the
4:133:9733:17:18:69:557:87:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:beneÖts of labor pooling are very strong, also exhibit smaller and denser clusters relative to

5:135:9916:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industries without this need. A comparison of di§erences between agglomeration due to Mar-
5:136:10006:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:shallian forces and those due to natural advantages (e.g., access to waterways) further conform
5:137:10101:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to our modelís predictions. This empirical work primarily employs continuous agglomeration
5:138:10191:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:metrics like that of Duranton and Overman (2005), and we use traits of industries in the United
5:139:10286:17:17:69:522:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Kingdom to conÖrm the causal direction of these relationships (e.g., Ellison et al. 2010).
5:140:10376:17:17:86:556:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our work makes several contributions to the literature on industrial agglomeration. Most
5:141:10464:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:importantly, we provide a theoretical connection between observable cluster shapes and the
5:142:10554:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:underlying agglomerative forces that cause them. At the core of this contribution is the simple
5:143:10649:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mechanism of including interaction costs among Örms.  The resulting framework provides a
5:144:10737:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:theoretical foundation for inferring properties of agglomerative forces through observed spatial
5:145:10833:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentrations of industries. We identify settings in which such inference is appropriate, as well
5:146:10931:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as key properties of agglomeration in such settings. An additional contribution of our work,
5:147:11023:17:17:69:557:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:discussed in greater detail later, is to provide a micro-foundation for using continuous spatial
5:148:11119:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:density measurements that center on bilateral distances between Örms. This class of metrics
5:149:11210:17:17:69:387:461:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:includes the popular Duranton and Overman (2005) metric.2;3
5:150:11269:17:17:86:556:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our central empirical contribution is a framework, motivated by our theoretical model, for
5:151:11359:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:meaningful analysis of agglomerative forces with continuous distance horizons. Previous work
5:152:11451:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:considers how agglomerative forces a§ect spatial concentration over di§erent distance horizons,
5:153:11546:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for example up to 75 or 250 miles (e.g., Rosenthal and Strange 2001, 2004; Duranton and
5:154:11633:17:17:69:557:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Overman 2005, 2008; Ellison et al. 2010). Our framework is an important step towards jointly
5:155:11725:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:considering agglomeration at di§erent distances (25, 75, and 250 miles) simultaneously. This
5:156:11817:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:paper provides a Örst rationale for this type of analysis, and we hope that future research can
5:157:11912:17:17:69:418:325:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:similarly analyze other factors that govern cluster shapes and sizes.4
5:158:11982:17:17:86:556:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Section 2 presents our theoretical model and connects it to empirical measurement of ag-
5:159:12070:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:glomeration. Section 3 tests the model using variations across patent citation clusters. Section 4
5:160:12168:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:presents the second empirical analysis that uses variations in industrial agglomeration for many
5:161:12264:17:18:69:330:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sectors of the economy. The last section concludes.
5:162:12315:18:14:82:557:239:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:2Studies of agglomeration metrics include Ellison and Glaeser (1997), Maurel and SÈdillot (1999), Marcon and

5:164:12534:8:13:82:557:217:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:3A further technical contribution of our work centers on establishing conditions to distinguish agglomeration
5:165:12643:13:10:69:557:204:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:due to Marshallian spillovers among Örms versus proximity to natural advantages. These have been observation-
5:166:12752:10:7:69:335:194:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ally equivalent in prior work (e.g., Ellison and Glaeser 1997).

5:172:13354:11:10:69:557:128:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shapes of cities (e.g., Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg 2002, Baum-Snow 2007, 2010, Glaeser 2008, and Saiz 2010) and

6:177:13742:28:17:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We now introduce a model of Örm location choice that generates large agglomeration clusters
6:178:13833:17:17:69:557:654:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from smaller, overlapping spillover zones. To maintain consistency with previous work, we use
6:179:13926:17:17:69:557:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the notation of Duranton and Overman (2005) whenever possible. The theoretical appendix
6:180:14013:17:31:69:423:620:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contains proofs of propositions and additional materials noted below.
6:181:14082:31:25:69:227:589:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2.1  Basic Framework
6:182:14102:25:17:69:556:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There areNÖrms indexed byi, and each Örmibelongs to an industryA(i).  These Örms
6:183:14182:17:17:69:556:547:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:isequentially select their locations, denotedj(i), from a Öxed setZ-R2of potential sites.
6:184:14271:17:17:69:557:530:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Sites are drawn at random according to a uniform distribution in advance of any Örmsílocation
6:185:14364:17:17:69:557:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decision. There are many more possible sites than Örms, i.e.jZj-N. To focus on agglomeration
6:186:14456:17:17:69:557:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economies, we assume that Örms compete in broad product markets. Location choice thus a§ects
6:187:14548:17:17:69:396:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the productivity of a Örm, but not its competitive environment.
6:188:14611:17:17:86:556:462:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The speciÖc beneÖts of locationjto a Örm in industryAare driven by two factors that
6:189:14694:17:17:69:557:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generate spatial concentration. First, intra-industry Marshallian forces represent productivity
6:190:14789:17:17:69:557:428:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spillovers that Örms generate by being in proximity to each other, independent of geographic
6:191:14881:17:17:69:557:411:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positioning relative to attraction sites deÖned shortly. Three common examples are customer-
6:192:14973:17:17:69:557:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:supplier interactions (e.g., reducing transportation costs for intermediate goods), labor pooling,
6:193:15071:17:17:69:202:377:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and knowledge exchanges.
6:194:15095:17:17:86:556:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Second, natural advantages make some sites more attractive for Örms independent of these
6:195:15183:17:17:69:557:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshallian forces. Shipbuilders are attracted to harbors, and pulp and paper mills are not well-
6:196:15280:17:17:69:557:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:suited for desert areas. Natural advantages can also be man made. State capitols, for example,
6:197:15374:17:17:69:557:309:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are attraction sites for law Örms, and universities can provide technology transfers to high-tech
6:198:15471:17:17:69:557:292:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industries. We accordingly model industry-speciÖc local advantages that represent the value of
6:199:15565:17:17:69:416:275:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:locating near a Öxed set of industry-speciÖc attraction sites,K(A).5
6:200:15633:17:17:86:556:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Trade-o§s between these factors a§ect Örmsípatterns of clustering, as does the distribution
6:201:15724:17:17:69:556:241:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the attraction sites. We denote bydj1;j2the spatial distance betweenj12R2andj22R2.
6:202:15809:17:27:69:478:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We assume that the beneÖt of sitej2Zto a Örmiin industryA(i)is given by

6:213:15995:38:15:82:556:105:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f18:5For technical reasons, we assume that locations of attraction sitesK(A)are realized before potential sitesZ
6:214:16103:15:11:69:557:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:are drawn. All attraction sitesk2K(A)are equally attractive to Örms in industryA. This assumption is made
6:215:16208:11:10:69:556:79:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:without loss of generality because, to capture the e§ect of attraction sitekthat is twice as attractive as sitek0,
6:216:16322:10:9:69:557:69:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:it su¢ ces to add a second attraction sitek00inÖnitesimally close tok. Any rational ratio between attraction site
6:217:16435:9:0:69:356:60:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:values may be approximated in this way using Önitely many sites.
7:218:16500:0:17:69:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The functiongj;A(i)represents the degree to which sitejis generally attractive for Örms in
7:219:16590:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industryA(i).  The two components of (1) respectively encapsulate natural advantages and
7:220:16678:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:intra-industry Marshallian forces. We assume the standard basic comparative static of the value
7:221:16773:17:17:69:556:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:functiongj;A(i): each functionGA-in (1) is decreasing, so that agglomerative forces decline over
7:222:16869:17:17:69:556:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:space. Additionally, for simplicity, we assume that agglomerative forces of type-either act
7:223:16960:17:17:69:556:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f7:across all distances or do not act at all. That is, for a givenA, ifGA-(0)>0, thenGA-(d)>0
7:224:17050:17:17:69:134:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for alld-0.
7:225:17061:17:17:86:556:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:The term-i;j-gj;A(i)is a positive i.i.d. random term representing the degree to which sitej

7:230:17522:17:17:69:556:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spatial attraction. Firms are not forward-looking, so that then-th Örm to enter,in(1-n-N),

7:233:17712:31:24:69:323:430:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2.2  Maximal Radius of Interaction
7:234:17746:24:17:69:557:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:So far, our model has more or less followed a standard structure: proximity to resources and

7:236:17931:17:27:69:526:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:now depart from this standard approach via a simple and natural additional assumption.

7:239:18189:17:27:69:278:311:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f22:interact with another Örm in industryA.
7:240:18228:27:17:86:556:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These Öxed costscA-relate to the costs of transporting goods, people, or ideas across Örms.
7:241:18319:17:17:69:557:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Opportunity costs and search costs are the simplest examples, but we further model that these
7:242:18412:17:17:69:557:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:costs are speciÖc to industries and spillover types. For example, accessing and understanding
7:243:18505:17:17:69:557:233:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:codiÖed technologies likely requires a lower Öxed cost of establishing interactions than that
7:244:18598:17:17:69:557:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:required for tacit technologies.  It is also easier to transport some natural advantages (e.g.,
7:245:18693:17:17:69:266:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lumber) than others (e.g., waterways).
7:246:18731:17:17:86:556:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Firms only invest in establishing contacts when the beneÖts of doing so equal or exceed the
7:247:18822:17:17:69:556:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:associated costs of interaction. SpeciÖcally, Örmionly invests in type--contact with sitejif

8:265:19377:27:17:86:556:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In practice, the key consequence of Proposition 1 is that agglomerative forces act only over

8:270:19697:17:17:69:556:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is clear from context). The maximal radius is (weakly) decreasing in the costscA-and increasing
8:271:19792:17:17:69:556:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the levels of the decay functionsGA-. In other words, lower costs or weaker attentuation of
8:272:19886:17:17:69:263:455:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:beneÖts lead to larger maximal radii.6
8:273:19924:17:17:86:556:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our assumption that interaction costs are Öxed is only to simplify the discussion below. One
8:274:20016:17:17:69:557:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:might naturally assume that interaction costs rise with distance; such an assumption would also
8:275:20111:17:17:69:557:404:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generate the maximal radius described in Proposition 1. The ultimate technical condition is
8:276:20202:17:31:69:523:387:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that interaction costs exceed interaction beneÖts at some distance with a single crossing.

8:278:20319:25:17:69:557:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We next examine how agglomeration clusters form in our model and their properties. Figures 2a
8:279:20412:17:17:69:557:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and 2b provide a graphical presentation of the theory to build intuition. To focus on the most
8:280:20506:17:17:69:556:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:essential parts of the model, Figure 2a only considers Marshallian spillovers (i.e.,GAK(0) = 0),
8:281:20602:17:17:69:556:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:while Figure 2b only considers attraction to natural advantage sites (i.e.,GAA(0) = 0). In these
8:282:20698:17:17:69:557:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:graphs, lightly colored circles are potential Örm locations, while Ölled-in circles represent sites
8:283:20797:17:17:69:557:246:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:populated by Örms. Stars indicate attraction sites in Figure 2b. Throughout this paper, we use
8:284:20891:17:28:69:538:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:these graphs to explain the modelís structure and depict the behavior of marginal entrants.
8:285:20982:28:25:69:296:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.3.1  Basic DeÖnitions and Structure
8:286:21019:25:17:69:557:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We deÖne anagglomeration clusterto be a group of industry-AÖrms located in sites intercon-
8:287:21109:17:17:69:557:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nected by bilateral interactions. Each Örm does not necessarily interact with every other Örm in
8:288:21205:17:17:69:557:142:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:its cluster, but all Örms in a cluster are interconnected. Our measure of agglomeration counts
8:289:21299:17:17:69:557:125:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the number of these clusters that are expected to arise for an industry. The use of an expectation
8:290:21397:17:17:69:556:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:is necessary because Örms choose randomly when indi§erent between sites. Firms in industryA
8:291:21488:17:18:69:414:91:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exhibit agglomeration if they typically occupy few distinct clusters.
8:292:21557:18:13:82:557:73:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:6Here, by saying that the maximal radius gets ìsmallerîor ìlarger,îwe refer to the standard vector ordering:
8:293:21665:13:0:69:364:60:10:g_d0_f19:10:g_d0_f4:(-K; -A) =---0= (-0K; -0A), if and only if-K--0Kand-A--0A.
9:294:21724:0:17:86:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:More formally: Forj2R2, we denote byBd(j)- fj02R2:dj;j0-dgthe closed ball of

9:300:21895:28:17:69:556:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This formula, while complex in its notation, has a simple interpretation.B0-A(j)is the union of

9:303:22091:17:17:86:556:564:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In Figure 2a, we draw for each populated site a representative maximal radius within which
9:304:22181:17:17:69:556:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the beneÖts of interaction exceed the costs for Örms. For this example,B0-Afor site A includes
9:305:22275:17:17:69:557:530:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sites B and C. Sites B and C are the only locations within the maximal radius for Marshallian

9:307:22382:17:17:86:556:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We next expand our focus to consider sites that are outside of the proÖtable spillover range
9:308:22474:17:17:69:557:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of sitej, but can be connected tojvia a single interconnection. DeÖneB1-A(j)to be all sites

9:310:22660:17:17:69:556:445:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:B1-A(A)further includes the four additional sites within distance-AAfrom site C that are outside
9:311:22756:17:17:69:557:428:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the spillover range of site A. We continue to iterate this process, successively adding additional
9:312:22857:17:17:69:556:411:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sites that are more spatially distant to sitejbut still connected to sitejby increasing numbers

9:327:23451:17:17:86:556:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When the maximal radius-Ais small, clusters are generally small. For two precise examples,

9:330:23705:20:17:69:557:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a maximal radius that is shorter than the shortest distance between two sites results in each
9:331:23798:17:17:69:556:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cluster only containing a single Örm. By contrast, when-A>(d;d),B-A(j) =Z[K(A)for
9:332:23879:17:17:69:557:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:allj2Z. A maximal radius longer than the maximal distance between sites results in a single
9:333:23970:17:17:69:186:94:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cluster for an industry.
9:334:23994:17:17:82:556:77:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:7The use of an inÖnite index in the union deÖningB-A(j)is ultimately unnecessary, as the Önitude of the set
9:335:24101:17:0:69:335:60:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of sites implies thatB--A(j) =B-+1-A(j) =---for some Önite-.
10:336:24162:0:17:86:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Suppose that natural advantages do not act in an industryA, i.e. thatGAK(0) = 0, so
10:337:24245:17:17:69:556:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that-AK= 0. (In this case, here and hereafter, we simplify our notation slightly by writing
10:338:24336:17:17:69:556:665:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:B-AA(j)- B-A(j).) If the Örst Örm in industryAwith maximal Marshallian radius-AAlocates
10:339:24423:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:at sitej;and the cluster aroundjcontains available locations (i.e.,B-AA(j)6=fjg), then there
10:340:24515:17:17:69:556:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is some sitej02 B-AA(j)which delivers positive utility áows to the next entrant in industryA.
10:341:24608:17:17:69:556:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:It follows that if Marshallian forces are su¢ ciently strong, then Örms in industryAselect sites
10:342:24704:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the clusterB-AA(j)untilB-AA(j)is Ölled. Iterating this analysis shows that when Marshallian
10:343:24798:17:17:69:333:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:forces are strong, Örms occupy clusters in sequence.
10:344:24850:17:17:86:556:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The sequential Ölling of clusters explains how large-area clustering may arise in an industry
10:345:24943:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:even if agglomerative forces act only over short distances. Cluster sizes associated with a given
10:346:25040:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:maximal radius can be much larger than the underlying radius itself. Clusters may span large
10:347:25132:17:17:69:459:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:regions even if each Örm derives beneÖts only from its immediate neighbors.
10:348:25207:17:17:86:556:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A consequence of the maximal radius, however, is that clusters can reach their capacity, at
10:349:25298:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which point the next entrant for the industry will locate elsewhere. In Figure 2a, the closest
10:350:25392:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:remaining site to the existing cluster is site X, but this location is beyond the spillover ranges
10:351:25490:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of any of the populated sites in the cluster. As the marginal entrant cannot proÖtably interact
10:352:25585:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with the cluster, it is indi§erent among sites X, Y, Z, and any other unoccupied site. It will
10:353:25679:17:17:69:391:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:choose its location based upon its idiosyncratic preferences-i;j.
10:354:25744:17:17:86:556:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Likewise, when natural advantages are important to industryA, Örms Öll clusters near at-
10:355:25832:17:17:69:557:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:traction sitesK(A)whenever possible. Figure 2b depicts the simple case where an industry does
10:356:25925:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not have any Marshallian spillovers, but a series of attraction sites are present and important for
10:357:26024:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:location choice. The maximal radius in this Ögure shows the range around each attraction site
10:358:26117:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:where Örms can proÖtably interact with the attraction site. A boundary or edge of the cluster
10:359:26210:17:17:69:144:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:again emerges.
10:360:26224:17:27:86:516:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The preceding observations suggest a natural notion of agglomeration in our model:
10:361:26306:27:17:69:556:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:DeÖnition 1.Thelevel of agglomeration in industryAfor maximal radius-Ais the expected

10:363:26472:27:17:86:557:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f22:We say that Örms are(weakly) more agglomerated with respect to maximal radius-1than
10:364:26555:17:17:69:557:203:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f4:they are with respect to radius-2if, holdingNAÖxed, fewer clusters of industry-AÖrms form
10:365:26644:17:17:69:557:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when the maximal radius is-1than when it is-2. Note that agglomeration increases as the
10:366:26731:17:17:69:557:169:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:expected number of clusters decreases. Holding industry size constant, increased agglomeration
10:367:26825:17:17:69:330:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:therefore also corresponds to increased cluster size.
10:368:26878:17:17:86:556:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our discussion of the marginal entry decision also highlights the core di§erence between
10:369:26966:17:17:69:557:118:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our structure and prior work. Without considering interaction costs, strictly positive spillover
10:370:27062:17:17:69:557:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:beneÖts exist at all distances. Industries may di§er in how fast or slow Marshallian beneÖts decay,
10:371:27161:17:17:69:557:84:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but these di§erences in Marshallian forces do not impact the number of clusters. Regardless of
10:372:27255:17:0:69:557:67:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whether the potential spillover beneÖt is large or miniscule, marginal entrants always select sites
11:373:27355:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:closest to the developing cluster regardless of distance (i.e., site X next in Figure 2a). As a
11:374:27450:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consequence, one cluster always forms for an industry, and entrants select sites in an exact order
11:375:27548:17:17:69:155:665:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:in all industries.8
11:376:27567:17:17:86:556:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Thus, the simplest framework does not provide a foundation for relating di§erences in spatial
11:377:27660:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentration for industries to their underlying agglomerative forces. Yet, our intuitive addi-
11:378:27755:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion of interaction costs provides additional traction by establishing a spatial range over which
11:379:27852:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interactions are relevant. This localization in turn provides meaningful di§erences in cluster
11:380:27946:17:28:69:348:580:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:formation. We now turn to these comparative statics.9
11:381:27999:28:25:69:385:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.3.2  Agglomeration due to Marshallian Advantages
11:382:28049:25:17:69:557:527:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 2a illustrates the consequences of a longer maximal radius for cluster formation. We
11:383:28140:17:17:69:557:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:enlarge the e§ective spillover range for site B to the wider circle. While we only enlarge site Bís
11:384:28239:17:17:69:557:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:circle for visual clarity, the comparative static we have in mind is one in which all Örms in the
11:385:28336:17:17:69:557:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industry have a longer spillover range equivalent to site Bís. Under the larger maximal radius,
11:386:28431:17:17:69:557:459:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the marginal entrant is no longer indi§erent over sites, but would instead choose site X. Thus,
11:387:28526:17:17:69:557:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a longer maximal radius is (weakly) associated with greater industry agglomeration as fewer
11:388:28617:17:17:69:215:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters form in expectation.
11:389:28646:17:17:86:556:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f7:More formally, recall that-AAis the maximal radius for intra-industry spillovers,-AA-maxfd:

11:391:28826:17:17:69:557:374:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Larger increases in-AA, either due to weaker attenuation in spillover beneÖts or lower interaction
11:392:28924:17:17:69:557:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:costs, can lead Örms to organize into fewer clusters. In fact, we may sign this change: so long
11:393:29019:17:17:69:557:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as Marshallian forces are su¢ ciently strong, industry-AÖrms become more agglomerated when
11:394:29109:17:17:69:559:323:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:-AAincreases. To simplify our demonstration of this fact in the next proposition, we ìturn o§î
11:395:29203:17:27:69:396:306:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:natural advantage e§ects by temporarily assumingGAK(0) = 0.10
11:396:29264:27:17:69:555:279:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f15:Proposition 2.IfGAK(0) = 0, then a longer maximal radius for intra-industry spillovers-AA
11:397:29353:17:27:69:412:262:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f22:leads to a (weak) increase in the agglomeration level of industryA.
11:398:29420:27:17:86:556:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The idea behind the proof of Proposition 2 is intuitive. A Örmithat is indi§erent across sites

11:400:29609:17:17:69:557:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more attractive to industry-AÖrms than are unÖlled sites outside ofB-AA(j(i)). If-AAgrows to
11:401:29701:17:21:69:556:184:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f4:^-AA, a radius large enough thatB^-AA(j) =B-AA(j)[B-AA(j0)for somej;j02Z, then the expected
11:402:29792:21:15:82:556:163:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:8This is equivalent to-A!1in our model. Once a Örst entrant for an industry picks a location, the set of
11:403:29896:15:7:69:485:148:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:sites Ölled by the remainingNA-1Örms (whereNA-jfi:A(i) =Agj) is exactly determined.
11:404:29979:7:13:82:557:141:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:9Our discussion and proofs focus on the simple case where spillover beneÖts do not transfer through the
11:405:30082:13:10:69:557:128:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:cluster. Interaction costs are incurred on a bilateral basis, and Örms at the periphery of a cluster only receive
11:406:30195:10:11:69:557:118:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:beneÖts from their immediate neighbors. More generally, our predictions hold for any transmission structures of
11:407:30306:11:11:69:304:107:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:beneÖts through the cluster so long as-AAis constant.
11:408:30359:11:10:79:557:96:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:The theoretical appendix discusses other extensions and attributes of this framework. Most notably, we outline
11:409:30469:10:7:69:246:86:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:some basic spatial dynamics for clusters.
11:410:30510:7:15:78:557:79:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:10The conclusion of Proposition 2 holds whenever natural advantage beneÖts are su¢ ciently small. However,
11:411:30616:15:0:69:451:64:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the assumption thatGAK(0) = 0substantially simpliÖes the demonstration of the result.
12:412:30702:0:17:69:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of clusters occupied by industry-AÖrms shrinks. Indeed, whenever a Örm locates in
12:413:30790:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:eitherB-AA(j)orB-AA(j0), industry-AÖrms Öll all ofB^-AA(j)before locating in or starting another
12:414:30886:17:17:69:106:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cluster.
12:415:30894:17:17:86:556:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Three empirical implications of the proof of Proposition 2 are evident in Figure 2a. First,
12:416:30985:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industries with a longer maximal radius have larger clusters in the sense of having more Örms and
12:417:31082:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:covering a greater spatial area. Intuitively, a longer spillover radius makes sites at the edges of
12:418:31181:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters attractive that are not attractive with a shorter radius. This induces marginal entrants
12:419:31278:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:into choosing these sites rather than starting new clusters. A longer radius can be due to weaker
12:420:31375:17:17:69:336:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decay of spillover beneÖts or lower interaction costs.
12:421:31429:17:17:86:556:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The second and third predictions are closely related. A longer spillover radius yields fewer
12:422:31521:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters for a given industry size. As clusters grow in size, fewer clusters are needed to house the
12:423:31621:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:NAÖrms in the industry. Finally, clusters are less dense. The longer radius activates sites at
12:424:31715:17:17:69:557:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the edges of a cluster that are too spatially distant to proÖtably interact with previous entrants
12:425:31813:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if the radius is shorter. Thus, growth in cluster size is simultaneous with reduction in cluster
12:426:31909:17:17:69:108:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:density.
12:427:31917:17:17:86:556:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our result that clusters due to a longer maximal radius are less dense is the same as saying
12:428:32009:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that average bilateral distances among Örms within the clusters increase. The modelís structure,
12:429:32105:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:however, contains a much more powerful implication regarding spillover lengths and the complete
12:430:32200:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distribution of bilateral distances within clusters. We draw out this implication in Section 2.4.3
12:431:32298:17:28:69:355:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:after introducing empirical measurement more formally.

12:433:32398:25:17:69:557:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To this point, our discussion has focused mostly on Marshallian agglomeration where Örms
12:434:32486:17:17:69:557:306:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:derive beneÖts from being near to each other. In partial analogy with Proposition 2, industries
12:435:32581:17:17:69:556:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:su¢ ciently dependent upon natural advantages also exhibit increased agglomeration as-AKgrows.
12:436:32675:17:27:69:504:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Moreover, this e§ect is mediated by the density of the set of potential Örm locations.

12:440:32929:29:17:69:557:170:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f22:then a longer maximal radius for natural advantages spillovers-AKleads to a (weak) increase in
12:441:33023:17:27:69:262:153:12:g_d0_f22:12:g_d0_f22:the agglomeration level of industryA.
12:442:33060:27:17:86:556:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The Örst condition is a requirement that natural advantages be su¢ ciently important to the
12:443:33151:17:17:69:557:109:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industry, and one su¢ cient condition is given in equation (10) of the theoretical appendix. The
12:444:33247:17:17:69:557:92:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:second condition, (3) in Proposition 3, requires that all attraction sites have been discovered.
12:445:33343:17:0:69:556:75:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This second condition prevents situations where-AKis so small that some attraction sites are out
13:446:33441:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of range of potential Örm locations. If (3) does not hold, increasing-AKcan lead to discovery of
13:447:33537:17:17:69:321:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:new resources, causing formation of new clusters.
13:448:33586:17:17:86:556:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If these two conditions hold, expansion of the radius-AKboth 1) expands the number of

13:452:33944:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:result holds. Figure 2b illustrates this case, and the same empirical predictions regarding the
13:453:34039:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relationships of cluster size, density, and number to the e§ective spillover length for an industry

13:456:34187:25:17:69:557:508:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:As a Önal step, we connect our theoretical framework to empirical metrics of agglomeration

13:458:34370:17:17:69:557:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:important given that micro-interactions among Örms are generally unobserved and must instead
13:459:34462:17:17:69:557:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be inferred from realized Örm locations. We thus need to build an apparatus to distinguish the

14:499:36899:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:abnormal or not. Because the density functions for small industries with fewer plants are natu-

14:530:38611:17:18:69:557:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that the structure required for Propositions 2 and 3 is minimal. These propositions build directly

15:537:39228:17:17:86:556:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The theory speciÖcally suggests that longer maximal spillover radii are associated with fewer,
15:538:39322:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:larger, and less-dense clusters. It is feasible to use these observed traits in di§erent industries
15:539:39421:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to rank order the lengths of di§erent spillovers. In empirical analyses below, for example, we
15:540:39515:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:provide suggestive evidence for the model by plotting an estimate of maximal radius for di§erent

15:542:39707:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:however, are partial representations of the complete predictions and in some sense ad hoc. They
15:543:39802:17:17:69:551:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:also do not provide a comparison to expected behavior similar to the DO conÖdence intervals.
15:544:39894:17:17:86:556:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:With additional structure, we can jointly quantify these predictions within the DO frame-

15:557:40974:17:17:69:449:305:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition 4 implies that the underlyingGA-function sharply attenuates.

15:559:41135:17:17:69:557:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:DO density estimations to characterize distributions continuously. Adding this more continuous

16:577:42620:25:17:69:557:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There is an additional beneÖt to connecting our model to these continuous structures. We earlier
16:578:42716:17:17:69:557:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:noted that our empirical implication of smaller, denser clusters for a shorter maximal radius is
16:579:42812:17:17:69:557:562:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equivalent to saying that the mean bilateral density for clusters declines. The model, however,
16:580:42907:17:17:69:557:545:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:has a much stronger implication for how spillover length ináuences the distribution of bilateral
16:581:43003:17:25:69:197:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distances within clusters.
16:582:43029:25:17:69:557:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:Proposition 5.There is some-- >(d;d)so that whenever-and-0are such that(d;d)< - <
16:583:43110:17:17:69:556:486:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f22:-0<--, then the mean intra-cluster Örm distance is (weakly) smaller when the maximal radius is
16:584:43204:17:25:69:172:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f22:-than when it is-0.
16:585:43223:25:17:86:556:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This result describes a key comparative static across spillover lengths.  When comparing
16:586:43311:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:two industries, we earlier established that the industry with the shorter maximal radius should
16:587:43406:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exhibit denser clusters such that very close bilateral distances are common. This proposition
16:588:43499:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:further identiÖes that this greater representation should be at its highest at the shortest bilateral
16:589:43600:17:17:69:557:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distances possible (i.e., among locations that are located very near to each other). This higher
16:590:43696:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:frequency should then (weakly) decline as one considers bilateral distances further from the
16:591:43788:17:17:69:228:342:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:shortest possible connections.14
16:592:43820:17:17:86:556:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To provide intuition, Örst consider the impact of the marginal entrant on the bilateral dis-
16:593:43912:17:17:69:557:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tances in Figure 2a. As site X becomes part of the cluster, the kernel density (4) incorporates
16:594:44007:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the bilateral distance from site X to every other populated site in the cluster into the spatial
16:595:44103:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:description. Some of the added bilateral distances are shorter than those that already existed in
16:596:44200:17:17:69:557:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the cluster, with the distance between sites X and B, for example, being less than the distance
16:597:44295:17:17:69:557:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between sites B and C. Yet, all of the additional bilateral distances are longer than the closest
16:598:44392:17:17:69:557:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:connections possible (e.g., those surrounding site C). Thus, as the cluster expands and becomes
16:599:44487:17:17:69:557:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:less dense, the relative impact on densities is highest at the shortest possible connections and
16:600:44583:17:17:69:307:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:proceeds (weakly) outwards for some distance.
16:601:44628:17:17:86:556:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:An empirical example can also help. Assume that the premium for proximity is higher for
16:602:44715:17:17:69:557:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:investment bankers than it is for accountants. We predict that clusters of investment bankers
16:603:44808:17:17:69:557:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should exhibit shorter mean bilateral distances among Örms than clusters of accountants do.
16:604:44899:17:18:69:557:121:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When comparing the spatial distributions of their clusters, Proposition 5 further indicates that
16:605:44995:18:13:78:557:103:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:13As discussed in the empirical appendix and Barlet et al. (2009), this approach is slightly strained for the
16:606:45104:13:7:69:354:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:largest industries but is a reasonable baseline for most industries.
16:607:45172:7:14:78:557:83:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:14The conditions of Proposition 5 indicate that this e§ect may disappear when the maximal radius is very
16:608:45276:14:9:69:557:69:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:large. This is a natural consequence of approaching a limit where the maximal radius is so long as to no longer
16:609:45387:9:0:69:188:60:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:ináuence cluster formation.
17:610:45416:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the greater density for investment banking should be at its highest at the spatial level of being
17:611:45513:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the same building or on the same block. When looking at Örms being Öve blocks away from
17:612:45603:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:each other, the spatial density for investment bankers can still exceed that of accountants, but
17:613:45699:17:17:69:543:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the di§erence should not be higher than it is when looking at being next door to each other.
17:614:45791:17:17:86:556:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This requirement micro-founds use of continuous density metrics like (4) to assess whether
17:615:45881:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:di§erences in agglomerative forces across industries yield meaningful deviations in agglomeration
17:616:45978:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:behavior. To summarize, we should empirically see that the greater density associated with a
17:617:46070:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:shorter maximal radius is at its maximum at the closest possible distance on the spatial scale
17:618:46164:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(the intercept of DO) and (weakly) decline thereafter for some distance. Eventually, a distance
17:619:46259:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is reached where the bilateral densities are the same even with the di§erences in maximal radius.
17:620:46356:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Continuing with our earlier example, the o¢ ces of investment bankers and accountants may be
17:621:46448:17:17:69:441:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equally represented when looking at Örms that are ten city blocks apart.
17:622:46520:17:17:86:556:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:After this point, a distance interval follows with relative under-representation for the cluster
17:623:46616:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:associated with the shorter maximal radius. Finally, once spatial distances are reached that rep-
17:624:46713:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:resent distances between agglomeration clusters for Marshallian industries, the relative densities
17:625:46811:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:again converge. In our example, accounting Örms should be more represented than investment
17:626:46901:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:bankers when looking at businesses 15-20 blocks from each other. This higher representation
17:627:46992:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of accountants should then decline as we consider progressively longer distances that start to
17:628:47086:17:17:69:196:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exceed the sizes of cities.
17:629:47113:17:17:86:556:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:By contrast, our model generally does not make predictions for bilateral distances across
17:630:47202:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshallian industries beyond the spatial horizons of individual clusters. The behavior of longer
17:631:47299:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:horizons depends upon the underlying distribution of cluster sites and it is thus ambiguous in
17:632:47393:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our general framework. The median bilateral distance for all Örms within an industry, for exam-
17:633:47488:17:17:69:557:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ple, can increase or decrease with a longer maximal radius depending upon the spatial distances
17:634:47583:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:among the multiple, growing agglomeration clusters and the newly activated sites surround-
17:635:47673:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing them. Our predictions at this scale instead relate to the distinctions between Marshallian
17:636:47767:17:28:69:243:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spillovers and natural advantages.
17:637:47801:28:25:69:505:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.4.4  Distinguishing between Marshallian and Natural Advantage Forces
17:638:47871:25:17:69:557:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, we determine conditions under which we can empirically separate agglomeration due to
17:639:47964:17:17:69:557:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshallian spillovers from that due to natural advantages. We generally do not observe the
17:640:48055:17:17:69:557:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:locations of natural attraction sites, hence it is not possible to distinguish these forces in every
17:641:48155:17:17:69:557:153:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:setting. Put another way, there is always some inherent limit to our observational capacity:
17:642:48247:17:17:69:557:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we may not be able to determine whether Örms are clustering around an unobserved natural
17:643:48335:17:17:69:202:119:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:advantage or each other.15
17:644:48361:17:18:86:556:102:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Analogous results have arisen in the work of Ellison and Glaeser (1997, 1999), DO, and
17:645:48447:18:13:78:557:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:15It may be possible to elucidate this with a dynamic approach; some intuitions along these lines are given in
17:646:48557:13:0:69:178:71:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the theoretical appendix.
18:647:48584:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:others. Historically, this feature of agglomeration measurement has been viewed as an advantage,
18:648:48680:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rather than a deÖciency, since it means that localization levels are determined in a fashion
18:649:48772:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:unencumbered by distinctions between sources of agglomerative forces.  The solution to the
18:650:48862:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Ellison and Glaeser (1997) location choice model, which is the micro-foundation of their widely
18:651:48957:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:used metric, is the same in both scenarios. However, this indeterminacy is not desirable when
18:652:49050:17:17:69:549:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:analyzing and contrasting the determinants of agglomeration (e.g., Ellison and Glaeser 1999).
18:653:49143:17:17:86:556:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Unlike in previous work, our framework allows us to partially infer the trade-o§ between
18:654:49231:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshallian forces and natural advantage dependency when attraction sites are su¢ ciently far

18:659:49580:27:17:86:556:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition 6 indicates that when natural advantages are su¢ ciently far away from each
18:660:49667:17:17:69:557:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other, dense agglomeration in small industries is likely driven by Marshallian factors, while
18:661:49760:17:17:69:557:441:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:natural advantage dependency is likely to drive agglomeration observed at longer horizons. If
18:662:49853:17:17:69:557:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coal mines or state colleges have su¢ cient distance between them, and an industryís location

18:664:50045:17:17:69:557:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this industry will generally be more dispersed than industries that are not ináuenced by these
18:665:50139:17:31:69:555:373:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:attraction sites. This observation is empirically conÖrmed below for a set of natural advantages.16
18:666:50238:31:24:69:281:342:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2.5  Our Empirical Approach
18:667:50265:24:17:69:557:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our model connects the maximal radius of interaction for an industry with the shape, density,
18:668:50358:17:17:69:557:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and number of clusters it forms. We test these predictions empirically in the next two sections.
18:669:50454:17:17:69:418:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For clarity, we Örst describe how our empirical analyses Öt together.
18:670:50523:17:17:86:556:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The graphical analysis in Figure 2a highlights that one approach for testing the model would
18:671:50615:17:17:69:557:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be to identify marginal entrants into clusters by industry and infer from their relative spatial
18:672:50711:17:17:69:557:233:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:location the maximal radius. This would be particularly powerful as the technique could be
18:673:50801:17:17:69:557:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:applied to any setting. While quite interesting, multiple data constraints, measurement issues,
18:674:50896:17:17:69:557:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and interpretation questions suggest this be left for future research. We thus take two simpler,
18:675:50992:17:17:69:434:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more transparent approaches that separately test aspects of the model.
18:676:51062:17:17:86:556:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our Örst test, presented in Section 3, uses patent citation data to measure the maximal radii
18:677:51155:17:17:69:557:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that exist in di§erent technology Öelds. This work closely links with technology or knowledge
18:678:51248:17:17:69:557:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spillovers as a rationale for agglomeration.  Returning to Figure 2a, our strategy is to use
18:679:51340:17:17:69:556:114:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:citation rates across bilateral distanceswithinclusters to determine whether (and how) distant
18:680:51434:17:18:69:556:97:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örms interact. By estimating the relative frequencies of B!A and B!C citations among the
18:681:51522:18:14:78:557:79:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:16It is important to note that, while our general framework can encompass many varieties of natural advantages,
18:682:51633:14:0:69:501:65:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:this prediction focuses on more structured settings with minimum distances across attraction sites.
19:683:51734:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sites in Figure 2a, we can develop a reasonable proxy of the maximal radius.  We can then

19:686:51939:17:17:86:556:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our second test in Section 4 is much broader in scope. We examine di§erences in agglom-
19:687:52026:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:eration across many industries and sectors in the US economy. This broader approach means
19:688:52115:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that we can no longer identify the micro-interactions among Örms. We instead pursue a more
19:689:52205:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:reduced-form approach where we take from the agglomeration literature traits of industries that
19:690:52300:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increase their desire to agglomerate for labor pooling or around natural advantage sites. We
19:691:52392:17:35:69:535:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:show how ordering industries by these traits produces the patterns predicted in our model.

19:694:52557:25:17:69:557:477:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We employ individual records of patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark

19:696:52731:17:17:69:557:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:about the invention (e.g., technology classiÖcation, Örm or institution) and the inventors sub-
19:697:52826:17:17:69:557:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mitting the application (e.g., name, address). Hall et al. (2001) provide extensive details about
19:698:52923:17:17:69:557:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:these data, and Griliches (1990) surveys the use of patents as economic indicators of technology
19:699:53019:17:17:69:557:392:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:advancement. The data are extensive, with over eight million inventors and four million granted
19:700:53114:17:17:69:206:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:patents during this period.
19:701:53141:17:17:86:556:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A long literature exploits patent citations to measure knowledge di§usion or spillovers. A
19:702:53231:17:17:69:557:341:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of studies examine the importance of local proximity for scientiÖc exchanges, generally
19:703:53325:17:17:69:556:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Önding that spatial proximity is an important determinant of knowledge áows.17Additional work
19:704:53418:17:17:69:557:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:links these local exchanges and economic clusters. Carlino et al. (2007) Önd that higher urban
19:705:53512:17:17:69:557:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:employment density is correlated with greater patenting per capita within cities. Rosenthal and
19:706:53607:17:17:69:557:273:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Strange (2003) and Ellison et al. (2010) both Önd that intellectual spillovers are strongest at the
19:707:53706:17:17:69:557:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:very local levels of proximity. These empirical patterns closely link to ethnographic accounts of
19:708:53803:17:17:69:359:239:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:economic activity within clusters (e.g., Saxenian 1994).18
19:709:53861:17:17:86:556:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Patent citations thus o§er us a unique opportunity to quantify di§erences in spillover radii
19:710:53953:17:17:69:557:205:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and cluster shapes.  It is important, however, to recall several boundaries of this approach.
19:711:54046:17:17:69:557:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:First, patent citations can reasonably proxy for technology exchanges, but there are many other
19:712:54141:17:17:69:557:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:forms of knowledge spillovers that may behave di§erently (e.g., Glaeser and Kahn 2001, Arzaghi
19:713:54235:17:17:69:557:154:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Henderson 2008).  Second, several studies Önd that patent citations reáect Marshallian
19:714:54325:17:19:69:557:137:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spillovers among Örms other than pure knowledge exchange. Breschi and Lissoni (2009) closely

19:716:54523:11:13:78:557:107:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:18Recent theoretical and empirical work further ties innovation breakthroughs to the clustering of activity
19:717:54630:13:11:69:557:94:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:around the discovery location, suggestive of very short spillover ranges (e.g., Zucker et al.  1996, Duranton
19:718:54739:11:11:69:557:83:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:2007, Kerr 2010). These concepts are central to endogenous growth theory (e.g., Romer 1986), and Desmet and
19:719:54846:11:0:69:406:72:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:Rossi-Hansberg (2010) presents a recent model of spatial endogenous growth.

20:722:55107:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:through customer-supplier exchanges. Our measurements below may encompass these e§ects to
20:723:55196:17:30:69:226:648:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:the extent that they operate.19
20:724:55227:30:25:69:290:618:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:3.2  Patent Data Construction
20:725:55256:25:17:69:557:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Inventors are required to cite the prior work on which their current patent builds. The total
20:726:55349:17:17:69:557:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:count of citations made by USPTO domestic and foreign patents granted after 1975 is about 41
20:727:55441:17:17:69:557:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:million citations. We Örst restrict this sample to citations where the citing and cited patents
20:728:55536:17:17:69:557:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are both applied for after 1975. This restriction is necessary for collecting inventor addresses.
20:729:55633:17:17:69:557:525:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our second restriction is that both patents have inventors resident in the United States at the
20:730:55728:17:17:69:557:508:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time of the invention with identiÖable cities and zip codes. About 15 million citations remain
20:731:55822:17:17:69:557:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:after these restrictions. Our primary dataset further focuses on the 4.3 million citations that are
20:732:55921:17:17:69:462:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:made in a geographical radius of 250 miles or shorter from the citing patent.
20:733:55998:17:17:86:556:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To identify these distances, we employ zip codes from addresses given for inventors. This
20:734:56087:17:17:69:557:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dataset combines both zip codes listed directly on patents and representative zip codes taken
20:735:56180:17:17:69:557:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from city addresses where zip codes are not listed. Where multiple inventors exist for a patent,
20:736:56276:17:17:69:557:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we take the most frequent zip code; ties are further broken using the order of inventors listed
20:737:56371:17:17:69:557:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on the patent. The spatial radius is deÖned using geographic centroids of zip codes and the
20:738:56462:17:17:69:557:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Haversine áat earth formula. We assign a distance of less than one mile to cases where the citing
20:739:56559:17:17:69:290:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and cited patents are in the same zip code.
20:740:56602:17:17:86:556:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our analyses below consider how distances between zip codes ináuence patent citation rates.
20:741:56693:17:17:69:557:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Two issues with using inventor zip codes should be noted. A small concern is that our approach
20:742:56787:17:17:69:557:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:does not consider all of the zip codes associated with inventors for some patents, and this may
20:743:56882:17:17:69:557:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lead to mismeasurement in our distance measure over short spatial scales (speciÖcally, an upward
20:744:56978:17:17:69:557:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:bias on the minimum distance). As a check against this concern, we Önd very similar results
20:745:57069:17:17:69:372:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when instead employing only patents with single inventors.
20:746:57127:17:17:86:556:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:More substantively, addresses listed for inventors can be either their home or work address.
20:747:57219:17:17:69:557:219:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:It would be nice to model both distances between work locations and distances between inventor
20:748:57313:17:17:69:557:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:home locations. Both of these distances can ináuence technology di§usion, and it is not clear
20:749:57406:17:17:69:557:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which is more important. The patent data do not let us separate these two, however, and this
20:750:57498:17:17:69:425:168:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:measurement error biases us against Önding shorter spillover e§ects.20
20:751:57568:17:13:78:557:151:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:19As an additional note, the literature on intellectual spillovers is divided on whether the development of new
20:752:57679:13:10:69:557:138:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:innovations is most aided by having a large concentration of oneís own industry or by industrial diversity. The
20:753:57790:10:9:69:557:128:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:view stressing industrial concentration is most often associated with Marshall, Arrow, and Romer (MAR). The
20:754:57897:9:10:69:557:119:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:MAR model emphasizes the beneÖts of concentrated industrial centers, particularly citing the gains in increasing
20:755:58009:10:9:69:557:109:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:returns and learning-by-doing that occur within industries. The second view, often associated with Jacobs (1970),
20:756:58122:9:10:69:557:100:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:argues that major innovations come when the ideas of one industry are brought into a new industrial sector. This
20:757:58234:10:9:69:557:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:perspective stresses that a wealth of industrial diversity is needed to create the cross-fertilization that leads to
20:758:58350:9:10:69:557:81:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:new ideas and entrepreneurial success.  Duranton and Puga (2001) formalize theoretical foundations for this
20:759:58457:10:8:69:379:71:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:model. Our empirical analysis focuses solely on the MAR determinant.
20:760:58525:8:0:78:557:63:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:20While we manually identiÖed work locations for the description of the San Francisco Bay Area in the intro-

21:762:58680:24:17:69:557:675:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our Örst analysis examines di§erences in spatial scope within clusters for Örst generation citations
21:763:58780:17:17:69:557:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:compared to later generations of citations. This analysis is useful because it provides evidence
21:764:58876:17:17:69:557:641:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for the interconnections among Örms built into our modelís structure. It also introduces the
21:765:58968:17:17:69:507:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:empirical framework that we use to calculate the maximal radius for each technology.
21:766:59052:17:17:86:556:607:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To introduce the terminology, a Örst generation citation is simply patent A (our focal patent)
21:767:59146:17:17:69:557:590:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:citing patent B. A second generation analysis analyzes the distances from patent A to a patent
21:768:59240:17:17:69:557:573:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C cited by patent B. Third generation citations are similarly calculated through the citations
21:769:59334:17:17:69:555:556:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:made by patent C, and so on.  If spillovers are not fully transmissible through a cluster,21
21:770:59426:17:17:69:557:539:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the maximal radius model predicts that Örst generation citations will be spatially nearer than
21:771:59520:17:17:69:557:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:later generation citations within clusters. This framework thus o§ers evidence about whether
21:772:59612:17:17:69:557:505:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:technology movements through clusters conform to our modelís structure, although other models
21:773:59705:17:17:69:239:488:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:may generate similar predictions.
21:774:59738:17:17:86:556:471:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We undertake this test using patent citations among bilateral pairs of zip codes that are within
21:775:59834:17:17:69:557:454:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:150 miles of each other. To allow for maximum áexibility in the estimations, we construct a
21:776:59925:17:17:69:556:437:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:series of distance rings indexed bydr. Our distance rings start with a ring of one mile or less,
21:777:60021:17:17:69:557:420:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which includes all citations that occur in the same zip code or between close neighbors. The
21:778:60113:17:17:69:557:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:next ring is one mile to Öve miles, and subsequent rings are every Öve miles to 50 miles. Denote

21:789:60736:17:17:69:557:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of citations occurring. We drop zip codes for which patents and citations are never observed
21:790:60828:17:17:69:557:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:locally. This regression thus describes the deviations in citation rates at di§erent distance bands
21:791:60927:17:22:69:557:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from what the spatial distribution of patents would predict. Zip code pairs with distances of 50
21:792:61023:22:9:69:557:179:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:duction, we are unable to replicate this approach for the full patent dataset. This is partly due to time constraints,
21:793:61141:9:10:69:557:170:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:but more importantly it becomes increasingly di¢ cult to assign inventions to facilities in multi-unit Örms. The
21:794:61253:10:10:69:557:160:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:San Francisco Bay Area is a nice case in that single locations typically house both corporate headquarters and
21:795:61363:10:9:69:557:150:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:innovation facilities. This collocation is much less prevalent in the New York City region, for example, where
21:796:61473:9:10:69:557:141:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:major Örms frequently have o¢ ces in Manhattan and in surrounding areas. These multiple o¢ ces even within
21:797:61579:10:9:69:557:131:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:250 mile circles limit the gain from this approach versus simply using known inventor addresses. Aarland et al.
21:798:61690:9:8:69:362:122:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(2007) study the separation of Örm activity into multiple locations.
21:799:61758:8:13:78:556:114:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:21Marshallian spillovers arefully transmissiblethrough a cluster if all sites in a cluster receive identical spillover
21:800:61876:13:10:69:557:101:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:beneÖts from one another, independent of location. In Figure 2a, this would result in Örms at sites A and B
21:801:61983:10:9:69:557:91:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:receiving equal beneÖts from a Örm at site C, even though site C is only within the maximal radius of interaction
21:802:62096:9:10:69:557:82:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of site A. The intuition is that the spillovers of site C are ìtransmittedîto the Örm at site B through the Örm at
21:803:62210:10:0:69:98:72:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:site A.
22:804:62219:0:17:69:288:699:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:to 150 miles serve as the reference group.22
22:805:62263:17:17:86:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3a plots the\fdrcoe¢ cients. First generation citations are remarkably concentrated at
22:806:62356:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:short distances. There is a particular spike at less than one mile, which includes citations within
22:807:62455:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the same zip code. Over half of this excess e§ect is gone when looking at zip codes one to Öve
22:808:62549:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:miles away, which connects to the very localized networking of Arzaghi and Henderson (2008)
22:809:62640:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the spillover estimations of Rosenthal and Strange (2003, 2008). The additional decline to
22:810:62734:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:zip codes Öve to ten miles away is very modest, after which a steeper decline ensues. A little
22:811:62828:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more than half of the excess e§ect evident at one to Öve miles is gone once 20-25 miles is reached.
22:812:62927:17:17:69:539:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Coe¢ cients for Örst generation citations are statistically di§erent from zero at all distances.
22:813:63023:17:17:86:556:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3a also graphs the spatial patterns of subsequent generations of patent citations. To
22:814:63115:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:construct these later generations, we randomly select one subsequent citation at each generation
22:815:63211:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:per cited patent.  We require that newly selected citations be within 250 miles of the citing
22:816:63304:17:17:69:557:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:patent to maintain geographic proximity, but not necessarily within 250 miles of the original
22:817:63397:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:citing patent. The speciÖcation (7) is again used to compare rates in local distances to the rates
22:818:63495:17:17:69:214:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that exist over 50-150 miles.
22:819:63524:17:17:86:556:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The results are intuitive and agree with the developed model. Earlier generations, or more
22:820:63614:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:immediate interactions, are signiÖcantly stronger at less than one mile than are later generations.
22:821:63713:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Di§erences at one to Öve miles, however, are much more modest. These relative di§erences slowly
22:822:63808:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decay from Öve miles onward. At longer distances, the spatial overlaps become very similar across
22:823:63905:17:17:69:130:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generations.
22:824:63917:17:17:86:556:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To provide a second baseline of comparison, we generate random citation pairs comparable to
22:825:64008:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our observed sample. For every patent cited, we randomly draw a patent with a similar patent
22:826:64100:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:class and application year. This method has been used extensively in the literature; we add the
22:827:64195:17:17:69:557:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:innovation that the new counterfactual citation must be within a 250 mile radius of the original
22:828:64291:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:citing patent. We do not exclude the original cited patent from the draws, and thus we use the
22:829:64385:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:original citation if there are no other patents with the same technology and application year
22:830:64478:17:17:69:557:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the deÖned spatial radius. This approach allows us to focus on local geographic areas and
22:831:64570:17:17:69:526:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:provide a rough comparison of underlying patent densities with similar technology traits.
22:832:64659:17:17:86:556:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The random citation counterfactual series is signiÖcantly di§erent from zero at short dis-
22:833:64749:17:17:69:557:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tances. This suggests that Örms with closely related technologies locate near each other even
22:834:64842:17:17:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:within spatial distances of 150 miles or less. Thus, the citation premiums evident at short dis-
22:835:64938:17:17:69:557:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tances combine both a higher likelihood to cite proximate neighbors and a higher likelihood to
22:836:65032:17:17:69:557:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cite generally Örms in closely related technologies. While our basic model is interested in both
22:837:65128:17:17:69:557:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of these mechanisms, we can derive further insights into the structure of interconnections within
22:838:65225:17:18:69:513:121:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters by comparing our citation premiums by generation with these counterfactuals.
22:839:65310:18:13:78:557:103:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:22The total sample count for these estimations is 429,400 zip code pairs with non-zero citation counts. We Önd
22:840:65420:13:9:69:557:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:very similar results when collapsing destination zip codes into consolidated rings around citing zip codes. Our
22:841:65531:9:10:69:557:81:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:core speciÖcation drops zero citation cells due to the log transformation. We Önd similar results when instead
22:842:65641:10:0:69:518:71:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:recoding zero citations to be one citation for cells where patenting exists but a citation does not occur.
23:843:65749:0:17:86:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The citation premiums for Örst and second generation citations at distances of one mile
23:844:65836:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or less are substantially stronger than those of the random counterfactuals. These deviations
23:845:65929:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gradually decay as distances between locations within clusters lengthen, with the initial decay for
23:846:66028:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örst generation interactions again being much more rapid. These results conÖrm that observed
23:847:66120:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:citations are not simply following from underlying spatial distributions of technologies. Moreover,
23:848:66219:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:even against the random baseline, initial interactions among Örms are most important at very
23:849:66311:17:17:69:282:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:localized distances and decline thereafter.
23:850:66354:17:17:86:556:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The contrast with third and fourth generation citations is also very informative. Third gen-
23:851:66446:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:eration citations are identical to the random counterfactual at distances of one mile or less.
23:852:66540:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:They then achieve relative importance between distances of Öve and 20 miles, before converging
23:853:66634:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:again to the random counterfactuals. Thus, extended chains of citations only mirror localized
23:854:66727:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:technology distributions at very short spatial scales, but the interconnected hops do aid access-
23:855:66824:17:17:69:557:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing technologies that are farther away in the cluster. Finally, fourth generation citations are
23:856:66919:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:under-represented at distances of less than one mile, whereas they mirror the random baseline
23:857:67012:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thereafter. This suggests that more than three interconnections do not provide additional access
23:858:67108:17:17:69:433:444:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:in technology clusters for the Örst 50 miles compared to 50-150 miles.23
23:859:67180:17:17:86:556:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These di§erences across citation generations suggest that knowledge spillovers are not fully
23:860:67272:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:transmissible through a cluster, but instead follow a pattern indicated by the Silicon Valley
23:861:67365:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:example and our modelís structure. In Figure 2a, the chain of interconnected hops B!A!C
23:862:67452:17:17:69:557:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:aids site Bís access to spillovers from sites around site C. Moreover, the extra strength for Örst
23:863:67550:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:generation citations over very short distances o§ers a path for identifying maximal radii of Örm
23:864:67646:17:31:69:259:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interactions that we investigate next.
23:865:67684:31:24:69:430:311:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:3.4  Maximal Radius and Spatial Cluster Patterns
23:866:67732:24:17:69:557:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our theory connects the maximal radius of Örm interactions with cluster structure. We test
23:867:67822:17:18:69:557:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:these predictions by looking at di§erences across patent technologies in their citation behaviors
23:868:67919:18:17:69:557:252:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:similar to Figure 3a. We analyze 36 technologies using the sub-category level of the USPTO
23:869:68009:17:28:69:508:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:system and Hall et al. (2001). Examples include Semiconductors, Optics, and Resins.
23:870:68092:28:25:69:372:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.4.1  Basic Calculations and Descriptive Evidence
23:871:68142:25:17:69:557:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We proxy the maximal radius of interaction for each technology through the citation patterns
23:872:68234:17:17:69:557:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evident among patents within that technology. We again measure how close citing patents are
23:873:68325:17:17:69:557:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:within individual clusters. One technology, for example, may show that most of the citations
23:874:68417:17:17:69:557:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that exist within local areas occur across Örms with a bilateral distance of ten miles or less.
23:875:68512:17:17:69:557:114:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, a second technologyís local citations could occur more evenly over distances
23:876:68607:17:14:78:557:97:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:23The patterns in Figure 3a allow for citations within Örms so that later generations of citations and the random
23:877:68720:14:9:69:557:83:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:counterfactual are simple to deÖne. Excluding citations within Örms, the citation premium for Örst generation
23:878:68829:9:10:69:557:74:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:citations at one mile or less is 1.8. The subsequent patterns look very similar. We exclude citations within Örms
23:879:68942:10:0:69:221:64:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in all subsequent citation analyses.
24:880:68980:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:0-70 miles. In the context of Figure 3a, this second industry would have a much áatter citation
24:881:69075:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:premium for short distances. While we cannot put an exact distance on each technologyís max-
24:882:69167:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:imal radius, we can use the di§erences across technologies in these observable citation patterns
24:883:69263:17:17:69:331:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to proxy relative di§erences in their maximal radii.
24:884:69315:17:17:86:556:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Operationally, we estimate for each technology a Örst generation citation regression similar
24:885:69407:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to that undertaken for all citations in Figure 3a. To develop a single measure of short technology
24:886:69505:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exchanges, however, we only include indicator variables for bilateral distances of [0,10] miles and
24:887:69604:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(10,30] miles. Thus, the reference group is bilateral zip code pairs of distances between 30-150
24:888:69700:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:miles. Our measure of technology spillover horizons is the observed premium over the Örst ten
24:889:69793:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:miles compared to this reference group. We exclude within-Örm citations from these calculations.
24:890:69889:17:17:86:556:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A shorter maximal radius is associated with a greater citation premium for the Örst ten miles.
24:891:69983:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The average premium is 0.43. Semiconductors has the greatest value of 0.74 followed by Surgery
24:892:70077:17:17:69:551:495:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:& Medical Instruments at 0.53. Values of less than 0.3 are found in Gas and Pipes & Joints.24
24:893:70170:17:17:86:556:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For each technology, we estimate the continuous DO spatial density metric described above.
24:894:70260:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3b provides descriptive evidence on patent cluster shapes. We group our 36 technologies
24:895:70354:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:into three broad buckets based upon the categories of the USPTO system following Hall et al.
24:896:70446:17:17:69:557:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2001): Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, and Medical (categories 1 and 3), Computers, Communi-
24:897:70535:17:17:69:557:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cations, Electrical, and Electronics (2 and 4), and Mechanical and Miscellaneous (5 and 6). The
24:898:70630:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:chart simply provides the fraction of technologies considered localized by distance within each
24:899:70725:17:17:69:231:376:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:grouping using the metric (5).25
24:900:70757:17:17:86:556:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Every technology within the Computers/Electronics grouping shows abnormally high spatial
24:901:70845:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentration over the Örst 30 miles. After 35 miles, however, localization within this group
24:902:70938:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decays rapidly and is mostly gone by 70 miles or thereabouts. On the other hand, the Chem-
24:903:71028:17:17:69:557:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:icals/Medical grouping shows abnormally high spatial concentration over 30-60 miles, with a
24:904:71119:17:17:69:557:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:much slower decay rate thereafter. Finally, there are no material variations by distance in the
24:905:71214:17:17:69:461:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:number of technologies localized for the Mechanical/Miscellaneous grouping.
24:906:71289:17:17:86:556:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These patterns roughly conform with our predictions, as the unweighted average citation
24:907:71376:17:17:69:557:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:premium for technologies in Computers/Electronics (0.48) is greater than in Chemicals/Medical
24:908:71469:17:17:69:557:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(0.43) and then Mechanical/Miscellaneous (0.39).  These di§erences indicate that the maxi-
24:909:71559:17:17:69:557:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mal radius for technology spillovers tends to be shortest in Computers/Electronics, followed by
24:910:71654:17:17:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Chemicals/Medical and Mechanical/Miscellaneous. Greater requirements for very close knowl-
24:911:71744:17:18:69:557:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:edge exchange are visibly associated with shorter, denser spatial clusters.  This description,
24:912:71838:18:13:78:557:154:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:24We Önd similar results to those described below when using other techniques to calculate these spillover
24:913:71944:13:9:69:557:141:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:horizons. Perhaps most interestingly, the patterns are the same when estimating the distance interval required
24:914:72054:9:10:69:557:132:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:to halve the citation premium evident at one to Öve miles compared to 70-75 miles or 145-150 miles. These half-
24:915:72165:10:9:69:557:122:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:life calculations mirror typical decay function estimations. The reported technique with the localized citation
24:916:72276:9:10:69:557:113:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:premium over 0-10 miles has the advantage of requiring much less data to compute consistently. This e¢ ciency
24:917:72385:10:10:69:557:103:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:becomes critical when we estimate these patterns at the technology level in the United Kingdom, where we have
24:918:72494:10:7:69:350:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:only about a tenth of the patents available in the United States.
24:919:72559:7:13:78:557:86:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:25Distances are calculated using zip code centroids. Computational limitations, primarily around constructing
24:920:72668:13:10:69:557:73:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:the counterfactuals, require that we calculate these densities using patents from 1990-1999. We calculate very
24:921:72778:10:0:69:432:63:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:similar densities for a few smaller technologies when instead considering 1975-2009.
25:922:72864:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:however, does not take advantage of the heterogeneity within groups or the intensity of agglom-
25:923:72959:17:28:69:236:682:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:eration, to which we turn next.26

25:925:73028:25:17:69:557:629:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3c provides a cross-sectional plot of cluster density and our proxy for maximal radius
25:926:73121:17:17:69:557:612:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by technology.  Density is measured by the share of bilateral distances among patents for a
25:927:73212:17:17:69:557:595:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:technology over 0-50 miles divided by the share of 0-150 miles. Shares range from 30% to over
25:928:73305:17:17:69:557:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:80%, with a very high share indicating that patents in the technology are very densely packed
25:929:73398:17:17:69:378:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in one cluster and then mostly absent until the next cluster.
25:930:73459:17:17:86:556:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There is a strong upward relationship between greater citation premiums (shorter maximal
25:931:73547:17:17:69:557:527:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:radii) and greater patent density. Recall that citation premiums are calculated controlling for
25:932:73642:17:17:69:557:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the underlying spatial patent distribution, so this relationship is not mechanical. The slope of
25:933:73738:17:17:69:557:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the trend line is 0.875 (0.163). Very clearly, some of the IT industries show exceptional densities.
25:934:73838:17:17:69:501:476:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:The slope of the trend line is 0.336 (0.075) when capping the density ratio at 50%.27
25:935:73923:17:17:86:556:459:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While this plot suggests a strong correlation between lengths of micro-interactions among
25:936:74012:17:17:69:557:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örms and cluster density at the technology level, it is natural to worry about reverse causality.
25:937:74109:17:17:69:557:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Existing cluster shapes and economic geography likely ináuence citation behavior. Moreover,
25:938:74200:17:17:69:557:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:technology clusters may have their spatial locations for unmodeled reasons (e.g., historical acci-
25:939:74298:17:17:69:557:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dents, Öxed university locations). The length of patent citations could then be determined by
25:940:74391:17:17:69:293:374:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the geographical features of these locations.
25:941:74436:17:17:86:556:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To address this, we calculate similar citation premiums using patent data from the United
25:942:74525:17:17:69:557:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Kingdom. Ellison et al. (2010) introduce this technique and discuss its strengths and limitations.
25:943:74623:17:17:69:557:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We geocode all city names and postal codes associated with UK inventors. We also manually
25:944:74712:17:17:69:557:306:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:search for addresses of Örms in the United Kingdom with more than Öfty USPTO patents
25:945:74796:17:17:69:557:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to provide more accurate city assignments. Calculating bilateral distances among pairwise city
25:946:74890:17:17:69:557:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:combinations, we then estimate a second set of technology-level citation regressions that parallels
25:947:74989:17:17:69:170:255:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our US estimations.
25:948:75008:17:17:86:556:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The UK calculations face several important limitations relative to the US calculations. First,
25:949:75102:17:17:69:557:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and most important, there are signiÖcantly fewer data points to estimate these citation premiums
25:950:75198:17:17:69:557:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(the UK sample is less than a tenth of the US sample size). Second, the geocoding has greater
25:951:75291:17:17:69:557:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement error, perhaps most centrally dealing with London. Finally, there is some selection
25:952:75386:17:18:69:557:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:bias in the set of UK inventors applying for US patent protection.  While these limitations
25:953:75477:18:13:78:557:152:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:26At Örst it may appear odd that a majority of technologies are deemed localized when the conÖdence bands
25:954:75582:13:9:69:557:139:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:are selected such that only 5% of the counterfactuals reach them. This is to be expected if agglomerative forces
25:955:75694:9:10:69:557:130:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:exist, however, as the counterfactuals build upon all patent locations. The counterfactuals are not selected such
25:956:75807:10:9:69:557:120:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:that only 5% of technologies will be deemed agglomerated. This levels e§ect for localization, along with its overall
25:957:75923:9:10:69:557:111:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:decline with distance, is predicted by our model if sites are distributed uniformly but agglomerative forces exist
25:958:76037:10:8:69:486:101:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:in nearly all technologies. The same pattern is shown in the industrial data in the next section.
25:959:76134:8:13:78:557:93:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:27Five technology sub-categories are residual groups (e.g., Miscellaneous Drugs) where consistent clustering
25:960:76242:13:9:69:557:80:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:concepts may not apply. Our results generally strengthen when excluding these groups, but we keep them in the
25:961:76351:9:0:69:145:71:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:presented results.
26:962:76371:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:restrict our analysis somewhat, the UK results in this section and the next provide important
26:963:76464:17:17:69:551:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:conÖrmation of our modelís predictions in a manner that addresses reverse causality concerns.
26:964:76557:17:17:86:556:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3d provides a cross-sectional plot of US cluster density against UK citation premiums.
26:965:76650:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The vertical axis is the same as Figure 3c, but we substitute the UK citation premiums for
26:966:76740:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the horizontal axis.  Interestingly, the UK citation premiums are weaker than in the United
26:967:76831:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:States on average (mean of 0.24 versus 0.43). This decline may reáect measurement error in
26:968:76921:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distances or more interesting economic di§erences. We do not further investigate, however, as
26:969:77014:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we are primarily interested in relative di§erences across technologies as a proxy for di§erences
26:970:77110:17:17:69:157:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in maximal radii.
26:971:77127:17:17:86:556:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:There are some substantial changes among some IT industries in Figure 3d compared to
26:972:77211:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3c. Most noticeably, semiconductors declines substantially (i.e., its maximal radius is
26:973:77305:17:17:69:557:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not as short as we measure in the US data). Nevertheless, the positive relationship persists
26:974:77397:17:17:69:557:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with cluster density in the United States. A greater citation premium for a technology in the
26:975:77490:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:United Kingdom, corresponding to a shorter maximal radius, links to a denser cluster in the
26:976:77581:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:United States. The slope of the trend line is 0.230 (0.075). The slope of the trend line is 0.159
26:977:77678:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(0.031) when capping the US density ratio at 50%. These patterns provide conÖdence that these
26:978:77771:17:28:69:416:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relationships are not being solely determined by unmodeled factors.

26:980:77867:25:17:69:557:374:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While transparent, the cross-sectional plots are incomplete in that they do not describe the full
26:981:77964:17:17:69:557:357:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distribution of location behavior. They also do not account for di§erences in industry size, which
26:982:78062:17:17:69:557:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:can have a mechanical e§ect on density estimates. We now use the DO methodology to describe

26:986:78362:17:17:69:556:272:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:useful to view the simpler density functions Örst. With some abuse of notation, we deÖne^KA;d

26:988:78548:17:17:69:556:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:extending to 245-250 miles. We again index distance rings withdrand denote the set of distance

27:1016:80556:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:miles using the US measure; the UK-based estimate is 0.6 standard deviations. By 60-75 miles,
27:1017:80649:17:17:69:476:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the abnormal spatial concentration is no longer statistically di§erent from zero.

27:1019:80819:17:17:69:557:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:miles or thereabouts. Using the US estimate of citation density, these clusters show an abnormal
27:1020:80915:17:17:69:557:376:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lack of density from 80 to 185 miles that is statistically di§erent from zero at every Öve mile
27:1021:81010:17:17:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increment. The UK estimation shows a similar pattern, although its point estimates are not
27:1022:81100:17:17:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:statistically di§erent from zero. In both cases, the point estimates converge to zero as distances
27:1023:81198:17:17:69:557:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:approach 250 miles.  At the edge of this spatial scale, di§erences in maximal radius are not
27:1024:81290:17:17:69:404:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:systematically associated with di§erent agglomeration intensities.
27:1025:81356:17:17:86:556:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:These patterns closely follow our theory model and the predictions given in Section 2.4.3
27:1026:81445:17:17:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:regarding maximal radii and cluster shapes. Note that the patterns of over-representation fol-
27:1027:81539:17:17:69:557:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lowed by under-representation are not mechanical. Other attributes, for example, could predict
27:1028:81633:17:17:69:493:240:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:higher spatial concentration for a technology at all spatial distances to 250 miles.28
27:1029:81719:17:17:86:556:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figures 3g and 3h take the next step of calculating localized deviations from industry speciÖc
27:1030:81813:17:17:69:557:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:conÖdence intervals using (6). The patterns are very similar to Figures 3e and 3f. The excess
27:1031:81906:17:17:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:density at very short spatial horizons is robustly di§erent from the random counterfactuals and
27:1032:82001:17:17:69:557:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:very similar to the kernel plots. The abnormally low spatial concentration at moderate spatial
27:1033:82095:17:17:69:557:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:horizons is weaker than in the raw kernel density plots, with the US estimator signiÖcantly
27:1034:82186:17:17:69:557:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:di§erent from zero over a narrower range of 120-155 miles. The UK estimator does not show
27:1035:82275:17:17:69:510:121:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:material deviations at moderate horizons once the conÖdence intervals are considered.
27:1036:82360:17:18:86:556:104:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Overall, these Ögures jointly illustrate our central model predictions.  A shorter maximal

27:1038:82562:13:9:69:557:73:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:next door to several thousand miles. This does not materially ináuence the cluster descriptions we develop here
27:1039:82673:9:0:69:171:64:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:over the Örst 250 miles.
28:1040:82699:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:radius, or greater spillover density, is very strongly associated with greater agglomeration at
28:1041:82794:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:very short spatial horizons (i.e., the cluster is denser).  These same technologies tend to be
28:1042:82888:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:under-represented at moderate spatial horizons (i.e., the clusters are smaller). The latter result
28:1043:82986:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is very strong in the raw US data, and it is partially conÖrmed with the UK estimator. Moreover,

28:1045:83188:17:35:69:278:614:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:by Proposition 5 is robustly supported.29

28:1047:83277:29:17:69:557:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This section uses data from the US Census Bureau to more broadly examine industry agglom-
28:1048:83366:17:17:69:557:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:eration in the United States. We Örst outline the US Census Bureau data employed. We then
28:1049:83455:17:17:69:557:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:compute spatial densities using bilateral distances among establishments by industry. We Önally
28:1050:83550:17:17:69:557:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:link di§erences in spatial agglomeration patterns to di§erences across industries in Marshallian

28:1053:83735:25:17:69:557:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our estimates of industrial agglomeration patterns are developed through conÖdential data
28:1054:83824:17:17:69:557:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:housed by the US Census Bureau. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) provides an-
28:1055:83909:17:17:69:557:392:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nual observations for every private-sector establishment with payroll from 1976 onward. The
28:1056:84000:17:17:69:557:375:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Census Bureau data are an unparalleled laboratory for studying the industrial structure of US
28:1057:84093:17:17:69:557:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örms. Sourced from US tax records and Census Bureau surveys, the micro-records document
28:1058:84180:17:17:69:557:341:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the universe of establishments and Örms rather than a stratiÖed random sample or published
28:1059:84270:17:17:69:557:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:aggregate tabulations. In addition, the LBD lists physical locations of establishments rather
28:1060:84363:17:17:69:557:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than locations of incorporation, circumventing issues related to higher legal incorporations in
28:1061:84458:17:17:69:557:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:states like Delaware. We deÖne 362 industries through the three-digit level of the 1987 Standard
28:1062:84554:17:17:69:557:273:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Industrial ClassiÖcation (SIC3). Industry assignment is at the establishment level for multi-unit
28:1063:84651:17:17:69:497:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örms. The data include 108 million workers and 5.8 million establishments in 1997.
28:1064:84733:17:17:86:556:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We use bilateral distances among establishments to create continuous density metrics similar
28:1065:84825:17:17:69:557:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to those described for our patent data. Our primary metric weights each establishment equally,
28:1066:84919:17:17:69:557:205:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and we have conÖrmed that an employment-weighted index yields similar results. Localization
28:1067:85010:17:17:69:557:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is typically higher in employment-weighted distributions than in those using plant counts (e.g.,
28:1068:85106:17:17:69:557:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Holmes and Stevens 2002).  We measure bilateral distances using distances between county
28:1069:85194:17:18:69:522:154:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:centroids. Establishments in the same county are given a uniform distance of one mile.30
28:1070:85282:18:15:78:557:136:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:29Similar results are found using three additional speciÖcation variants. The Örst employs the density function
28:1071:85393:15:11:69:557:121:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(4) and introduces the conÖdence bandsKLCI-UA(d)andKLCI-LA(d)as precision controls. The second calculates
28:1072:85498:11:10:69:557:110:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a global index similar to DOís main metric and then evaluates the gradient of this concentration measure across
28:1073:85609:10:7:69:471:100:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:distances. Finally, the DO conÖdence bands can be adjusted to a 1%/99% signiÖcance level.
28:1074:85698:7:14:78:557:93:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:30Multiple factors yield conáicting recommendations regarding this latter choiceó for example, accounting for
28:1075:85807:14:9:69:557:79:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:larger land areas versus congestion e§ects with higher urban density. As shown below, the major movements we
28:1076:85915:9:0:69:551:70:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:analyze in this section happen at distances of 50 miles or greater, making this choice of secondary importance.
29:1077:86028:0:17:86:556:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4a graphs the fraction of industries that are localized at each distance level, akin to
29:1078:86122:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 3b. We analyze 25 mile increments to 1000 miles. Approximately 60% of industries dis-
29:1079:86214:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:play positive localization at each increment to 125 miles. Of the remainder, about 30% display
29:1080:86308:17:17:69:557:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dispersion and 10% show neither pattern. Localization attenuates over moderate distances, and
29:1081:86401:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:only 30% of industries are localized at distances of 900-1000 miles. Manufacturing industries
29:1082:86494:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are more agglomerated at short spatial scales than non-manufacturing industries, a pattern that
29:1083:86589:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:reverses at longer horizons. This result is to be expected, given the transportable and trade-
29:1084:86683:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:able nature of manufactured products. The empirical appendix provides additional descriptive

29:1087:86811:24:17:69:557:508:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We develop two traits of industries to model the Marshallian agglomeration and natural advan-
29:1088:86904:17:17:69:557:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tages forces analyzed in our theoretical model. For the former, we focus on labor pooling as a
29:1089:86998:17:17:69:557:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rationale for Örm clustering. Multiple models speciÖcally describe the beneÖts of Örm cluster-
29:1090:87092:17:17:69:556:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing due to specialized workforces.31We focus on this feature, recognizing that other forms of
29:1091:87185:17:17:69:505:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Marshallian interactions exist (e.g., Rosenthal and Strange 2004, Ellison et al. 2010).
29:1092:87272:17:17:86:556:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We measure how concentrated or specialized the occupational needs of an industry are
29:1093:87356:17:17:69:557:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:through the 1999 National Industry-Occupation Employment Matrix (NIOEM) published by
29:1094:87440:17:17:69:557:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The NIOEM provides industry-level employments in over 700
29:1095:87529:17:17:69:557:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:occupations. We calculate the occupational concentration for each industry as a HerÖndahl-
29:1096:87619:17:17:69:557:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Hirschman Index (HHI) of employments across occupations. Higher values of this index suggest
29:1097:87711:17:17:69:557:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:greater concentration of workers in a small number of occupations, which increases the spillover
29:1098:87807:17:17:69:254:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:beneÖts of industrial agglomeration.
29:1099:87843:17:17:86:556:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4b provides some simple evidence that this labor concentration relates to spatial
29:1100:87931:17:17:69:557:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:scales. We divide industries into terciles based upon their occupational concentration. Highly
29:1101:88025:17:18:69:557:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentrated industries are more likely to be localized at shorter spatial scales; they are less
29:1102:88121:18:17:69:557:252:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:likely to exhibit localization at longer spatial horizons. Figure 4bís trends are for all industries,
29:1103:88222:17:17:69:431:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and the same patterns hold both within and outside of manufacturing.
29:1104:88290:17:17:86:556:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We next model natural advantages for manufacturing industries using data from the Census
29:1105:88378:17:17:69:557:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of Manufacturers.  There are many natural advantages that one could model, and we pick
29:1106:88464:17:17:69:557:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Öve for this exercise: coal inputs, natural gas inputs, lumber inputs, agricultural and livestock
29:1107:88561:17:17:69:557:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inputs, and dependency upon water transportation. We normalize each of these dependencies
29:1108:88650:17:14:78:557:150:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:31Marshall (1920) described how an agglomeration of workers and Örms shields workers from Örm-speciÖc
29:1109:88751:14:9:69:557:136:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shocks. Workers can be more productive and better insured by moving from Örms that are hit with negative
29:1110:88855:9:11:69:557:127:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:shocks to better opportunities (e.g., Diamond and Simon 1990, Krugman 1991, Overman and Puga 2010). Larger
29:1111:88961:11:11:69:557:116:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:labor pools further promote more e¢ cient matches (e.g., Helsley and Strange 1990), and multiple Örms protect
29:1112:89070:11:10:69:557:105:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:workers against ex post appropriation of investments in human capital (e.g., Rotemberg and Saloner 2000). All
29:1113:89179:10:9:69:557:95:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:of these mechanisms suggest that Örms that employ similar types of workers will tend to locate near one another
29:1114:89290:9:11:69:557:86:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:and that Örms will beneÖt from thick local markets for their speciÖc labor needs. Glaeser and Kerr (2009) provide
29:1115:89403:11:10:69:557:75:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:a further discussion of this pooling concept. Duranton and Puga (2004) and Glaeser (2008) provide a general

30:1118:89654:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:its maximum dependency across these Öve traits. Some of the largest dependencies on natural
30:1119:89745:17:17:69:469:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:advantages are found in food processing, pulp and paper, and steel industries.
30:1120:89823:17:17:86:556:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4c again provides simple evidence that natural advantages are systematically related
30:1121:89914:17:17:69:557:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to spatial scales. We divide manufacturing industries into terciles. In contrast to Figure 4b, the
30:1122:90012:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:most dependent industries on natural advantages are the least likely to be abnormally concen-
30:1123:90105:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trated at small spatial distances. This dependency instead exhibits itself over horizons of 250 to
30:1124:90203:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:700 miles. The industries most concentrated to 200 miles are those with the least dependency
30:1125:90295:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on natural advantages. The rates of decay at the edges for natural advantages also appear more
30:1126:90389:17:31:69:111:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gradual.
30:1127:90397:31:24:69:414:515:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4.3  Labor Pooling and Spatial Cluster Patterns
30:1128:90444:24:17:69:557:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To more formally test these patterns, we run a series of regressions similar to the patent re-
30:1129:90538:17:17:69:557:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gression model (8). We organize the data by industriesAand distancesd. We use 40 distance
30:1130:90627:17:17:69:557:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:intervals, ranging from 0-25 miles to 975-1000 miles, and 353 industries for a total of 14,120
30:1131:90721:17:17:69:557:440:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:observations. We exclude nine industries from our general sample of 362 industries for which we
30:1132:90816:17:17:69:318:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cannot calculate all of the explanatory variables.
30:1133:90866:17:17:86:556:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We present the patterns using the basic kernel estimator (4); the results are very similar with
30:1134:90961:17:17:69:557:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the other variants studied in Section 4. We again transform variables to have unit standard de-
30:1135:91056:17:17:69:557:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:viation to aid in interpretation. The size variation of these industries is substantially larger than
30:1136:91157:17:17:69:557:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:among patent technologies.32To provide the most representative depictions, we conservatively
30:1137:91249:17:17:69:557:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cap extreme densities at their 1% and 99% values by distance and weight by log employment
30:1138:91338:17:17:69:557:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the industry. These speciÖcation steps are not very important, however, and the patterns we
30:1139:91432:17:17:69:341:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:describe are very robust across speciÖcation variants.
30:1140:91486:17:17:86:556:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4d Örst tests occupational concentration across all industries. Higher occupational
30:1141:91576:17:18:69:557:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentration promotes localization over the Örst 100 miles, with substantial and monotonic
30:1142:91667:18:17:69:557:252:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:attenuation thereafter. By 250 miles, higher occupational concentration is no longer associated
30:1143:91762:17:17:69:557:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with greater localization at a 90% conÖdence level. The magnitudes are important in economic
30:1144:91854:17:17:69:557:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:size. A standard deviation increase in occupational concentration is associated with a 0.6 stan-
30:1145:91950:17:17:69:557:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dard deviation increase in localization to 100 miles. It is also clear that the total length of the
30:1146:92049:17:17:69:557:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:agglomeration cluster associated with labor pooling is substantially longer than typical commut-
30:1147:92145:17:17:69:557:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing distances (which are frequently less than 40 minutes), akin to the San Francisco example in
30:1148:92240:17:17:69:122:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 1b.
30:1149:92250:17:17:86:556:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We have conÖrmed this pattern using several other techniques for measuring occupational
30:1150:92337:17:17:69:557:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:concentration or specialization. We Önd similar results when calculating the concentration ratio
30:1151:92433:17:17:69:557:99:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of employment in the most frequent occupations or in the top four occupations. Similarly, we Önd
30:1152:92529:17:14:78:557:82:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:32Counts of patents used in our estimations range from 2811 to over 66,000. Among the industrial data, 18
30:1153:92634:14:0:69:498:68:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:industries have fewer than 100 establishments, while the maximum is over 400,000 establishments.
31:1154:92732:0:17:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the opposite pattern of results when modeling the number of occupations listed. Industries with
31:1155:92827:17:17:69:557:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more listed occupations, regardless of employment levels, are associated with greater dispersion.
31:1156:92924:17:17:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We also Önd that the results are invariant to including other distance-based interactions for
31:1157:93017:17:17:69:502:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average wage, college share, labor intensity, and the number of Örms in the industry.
31:1158:93102:17:17:86:556:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To check that reverse causality is not the case for our labor measures, we calculate the cor-
31:1159:93195:17:17:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:responding occupational concentration of manufacturing industries in the United Kingdom. We
31:1160:93286:17:17:69:557:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:use data from the UK Labour Force Survey, which is similar to the USís Current Population
31:1161:93375:17:17:69:557:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Survey. The patterns in Figure 4e are very similar. This suggests that our results are not due
31:1162:93469:17:17:69:557:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to endogenous selections of production techniques by spatially isolated industries to match local
31:1163:93566:17:17:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:worker environments.33A second advantage of the UK test is that the occupational concentra-
31:1164:93657:17:17:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tions are calculated from a second data source, suggesting that our outcomes are not dependent
31:1165:93751:17:17:69:323:512:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:upon idiosyncratic features of the BLSís NIOEM.
31:1166:93798:17:17:86:556:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The shapes of these distributions mirror Figures 3e-3h. It is important to note, however, the
31:1167:93891:17:17:69:557:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more subtle di§erences in the estimation. A central strength of the patent data is the capacity
31:1168:93986:17:17:69:557:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to model directly the micro-level interactions of Örms to calculate a measure of the maximum
31:1169:94078:17:17:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:radii. While the Census Bureau data allows us to consider many more industries and sectors,
31:1170:94169:17:31:69:513:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this broader dataset requires a reduced-form approach that models traits of industries.
31:1171:94256:31:24:69:455:396:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4.4  Natural Advantages and Spatial Cluster Patterns
31:1172:94308:24:17:69:557:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4f considers natural advantages within the manufacturing sector.  These estimations
31:1173:94398:17:17:69:557:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:control for occupational concentration, with the unreported coe¢ cients being very similar to
31:1174:94491:17:17:69:557:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 4d. The contrast between natural advantages and labor agglomeration is very interesting
31:1175:94585:17:17:69:557:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and supports the crossing property of our model described in Proposition 6. High dependency
31:1176:94676:17:17:69:557:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:upon natural advantages is associated with dispersion (a lack of density) at short spatial scales.
31:1177:94774:17:17:69:557:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This follows from coal mines, coastal ports, and similar features naturally having some distance
31:1178:94870:17:18:69:557:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between them. The e§ective radius for transporting goods and material inputs is also longer
31:1179:94961:18:17:69:185:252:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than for labor pooling.
31:1180:94984:17:17:86:556:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Over the next 500 miles, however, the importance of natural advantages grows. By distances
31:1181:95074:17:17:69:557:218:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of 400 miles, the agglomerative force of natural advantages exceeds that of labor, and remains
31:1182:95168:17:17:69:557:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:strong until about 800 miles. Very clearly, the spatial dimension of natural advantages is longer,
31:1183:95266:17:17:69:557:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and it appears that the attenuation rate is weaker, than for the Marshallian agglomeration
31:1184:95356:17:17:69:557:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:proxied by our labor features. This is most evident in the modest gradients and long spatial
31:1185:95448:17:17:69:557:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:durations of the slope in Figure 4f.  The shapes of these densities conform to our modelís
31:1186:95538:17:17:69:128:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:predictions.
31:1187:95550:17:14:78:557:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:33Several theoretical models describe spatial location choice and production technology as jointly determined
31:1188:95659:14:0:69:299:102:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:(e.g., Duranton and Puga 2001, Glaeser et al. 2010).
32:1189:95713:0:28:69:191:699:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:5  Conclusion
32:1190:95726:28:17:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This paper introduces a new model of location choice and agglomeration behavior. From a simple
32:1191:95820:17:17:69:557:654:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and general framework, we show that agglomeration clusters generally cover a substantially
32:1192:95910:17:17:69:557:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:larger area than the micro-interactions upon which they build. In turn, agglomerative forces
32:1193:96002:17:17:69:557:620:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with longer micro-interactions are associated with fewer, larger, and less-dense clusters. The
32:1194:96096:17:17:69:557:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:theory thereby provides a basis for the use of continuous agglomeration metrics that build upon
32:1195:96191:17:17:69:557:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:bilateral distances among Örms. The theory also rationalizes the use of observable cluster shapes
32:1196:96288:17:17:69:557:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and sizes to rank order the lengths of underlying agglomerative forces. We Önd conÖrmation of
32:1197:96381:17:17:69:557:552:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our theoretical predictions using both variations across patent technology clusters and variations
32:1198:96479:17:17:69:227:535:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across industry concentrations.
32:1199:96510:17:17:86:556:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We hope that our theoretical framework proves an attractive model for incorporating ad-
32:1200:96597:17:17:69:557:501:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ditional factors that ináuence Örm location and agglomeration behavior. Important extensions
32:1201:96689:17:17:69:557:484:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:include: modelling the dynamics of industry life-cycles, incorporating interactions across Örms in
32:1202:96787:17:17:69:557:467:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:di§erent industries, allowing for pricing of locations, and incorporating the development of new
32:1203:96883:17:17:69:557:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sites. We likewise believe our setting is an attractive laboratory for structural modelling that
32:1204:96979:17:17:69:557:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:would allow recovery of the underlying lengths of micro-interactions. These parameters could
32:1205:97071:17:17:69:557:416:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in turn be useful for understanding spillover transmissions in networks and for studying spatial
32:1206:97167:17:17:69:234:399:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:propagation of economic shocks.
32:1207:97198:17:18:86:556:382:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We have applied our framework to two empirical settings, but we believe that many more
32:1208:97284:18:17:69:557:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:applications in industrial agglomeration are possible. For example, future work can look to price
32:1209:97381:17:17:69:557:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters or identify spillover lengths by examining the location decisions of marginal entrants.
32:1210:97477:17:17:69:557:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our framework highlights the important information that is contained in these indi§erence
32:1211:97566:17:17:69:557:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:conditions if properly identiÖed. As important, we believe our framework describes interactions
32:1212:97661:17:17:69:557:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in many other contexts as well. For example, studies Önd that knowledge áows within Örms
32:1213:97749:17:17:69:557:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or universities are substantially shaped by the physical layout of facilities (e.g., Liu 2010). We
32:1214:97847:17:17:69:557:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:hope that future work similarly analyzes parallel situations where costs of interaction generate
32:1215:97943:17:59:69:161:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a maximal radius.

47:1786:126049:31:22:69:227:623:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:Proof of Proposition 2
47:1787:126071:22:12:69:556:601:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Throughout, we Öx the industryAand only consider Marshallian forces, so that-AK= 0. Thus,
47:1788:126160:12:11:69:556:589:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for simplicity, we henceforth suppress the indicesAandAwhenever doing so does not introduce
47:1789:126251:11:12:69:556:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:confusion.  We also assume for notational convenience that the Örms in industryAenter in
47:1790:126339:12:12:69:557:566:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:uninterrupted sequence. The results are unchanged if we instead assume that Örms in other
47:1791:126428:12:12:69:556:554:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:industries enter between Örmsiandi0, so long as the entry order of all Örms is Öxed at the
47:1792:126518:12:13:69:379:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:beginning. Finally, we assume a generic distribution of sites.
47:1793:126580:13:11:86:557:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We order the Örms in industryAby entry periodi= 1;:::;NA, and letZibe the set
47:1794:126657:11:12:69:557:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of sites occupied at the stage in which Örmichooses its location. Since sites are generically
47:1795:126750:12:12:69:556:506:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:distributed and only Marshallian forces a§ect the location decision of Örmi, we see thatiis
47:1796:126841:12:13:69:557:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:indi§erent between sites if and only ifB-(j(i-1))nZi=;. In that case,ichooses locations
47:1797:126928:13:14:69:556:481:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:randomly. Otherwise,ichooses the unique sitej(i)2B-(j(i-1))nZiwhich maximizesgj(i);A,

47:1799:127031:12:12:86:556:455:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The preceding discussion implies that the set of locations occupied by industry-AÖrms fol-

47:1827:127982:13:23:69:442:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clearly agglomeration behavior is unchanged. Thus, we may assume that

49:1903:131659:13:12:86:557:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Thus, we need only consider the case in whichjB-0(K)j>jB-(K)j. Because the site dis-

50:2008:137400:17:12:78:421:137:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:41This assumption implicitly deÖnes the constant-of the theorem statement.

51:2019:137696:0:11:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:complete clusters could be dynamically vacated in favor of more appropriate locations due to
51:2020:137788:11:12:69:193:688:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:entry and exit behavior.
51:2021:137812:12:11:86:556:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:By contrast, when natural advantages dominate Marshallian forces, as under the conditions of
51:2022:137904:11:12:69:557:665:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition 3, the pattern of location choices for Örms is dynamically stable. If a Örm exits in this
51:2023:138005:12:11:69:556:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:scenario, then the newly vacated sitejis the most valuable site available. This is immediate by
51:2024:138100:11:13:69:556:642:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:virtue of the fact that sitejwas previously selected and all resource attraction sites are known.
51:2025:138197:13:12:69:557:629:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Since natural advantage spillovers dominate, locationjmust be (weakly) optimal relative to
51:2026:138287:12:11:69:556:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other available sites. Thus, if the number of Örms in industryAis constant, then the pattern of
51:2027:138382:11:12:69:446:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Örm locations is constant if natural advantages are of central importance.
51:2028:138456:12:11:86:556:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The dynamics are determined by Marshallian conditions if a natural advantage site loses its
51:2029:138547:11:12:69:557:583:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:innate importance. If local Marshallian forces are strong, agglomeration can persist absent the
51:2030:138642:12:12:69:557:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:original natural advantages. If local Marshallian forces are weak, the cluster may be vacated over
51:2031:138740:12:13:69:557:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time. The former scenario is in line with the related empirical work by Bleakley and Lin (2010) on
51:2032:138838:13:12:69:557:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the persistence of US cities originally centered on portage sites. This natural advantage has lost
51:2033:138936:12:12:69:557:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:its economic importance, but Bleakley and Lin (2010) Önd continued and growing importance
51:2034:139025:12:9:69:161:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of these locations.
51:2035:139044:9:11:86:556:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Looking ahead to future work, this framework provides a tractable setting for modelling
51:2036:139131:11:12:69:557:502:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:agglomeration patterns and industry evolution. As industries mature, their needs evolve and

51:2039:139409:12:11:69:557:467:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The associated changes in spillover lengths can be linked to dynamics in cluster patterns through
51:2040:139506:11:13:69:557:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this framework. Extending the model to have interesting interactions across industries could also

51:2050:139944:20:13:98:556:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:traces out some of the properties that arise due to coagglomeration (e.g., the spatial scale
51:2051:140036:13:12:98:556:327:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of coagglomeration can exceed agglomeration even if the interaction e§ect is weaker). We
51:2052:140124:12:22:98:422:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:will pursue these coagglomeration traits further in future work.
51:2053:140188:22:11:86:556:293:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:-Our framework assumes that interaction costs exceed spillover beneÖts at some distance,
51:2054:140276:11:12:98:556:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with a single crossing property. While this condition holds in many settings, it is interest-
51:2055:140369:12:11:98:556:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing to note an empirical case where it does not. Ethnic networks have long been associated
51:2056:140459:11:13:98:556:259:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with reducing interaction costs at great distances and thereby facilitating economic ex-
51:2057:140547:13:12:98:556:246:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:changes (e.g., Rauch 2001, Kerr 2008). In e§ect, these networks transmit the beneÖts of
51:2058:140634:12:11:98:556:234:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:clusters that are typically conÖned spatially. Future extensions of this model could allow
51:2059:140724:11:22:98:372:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for networks, ethnic or otherwise, to connect clusters.
51:2060:140779:22:12:86:556:201:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f4:-In some industries, natural advantages are transmitted through contact with other Örms.
51:2061:140867:12:13:98:557:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:That is, if an industry-AÖrmihas access to a natural advantage sitek2K(A(i)), and

51:2064:141119:13:13:98:556:151:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:scope of this paper, one special case stands out. IfGA(0) = 0and natural advantages are
51:2065:141206:13:12:98:557:138:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fully transmissible44, then Örms behave as in the case of Marshallian forces with attraction
51:2066:141298:12:11:98:556:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sites dictating the spatial distribution of Örm locations. In this case, agglomeration again
51:2067:141390:11:39:98:373:115:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increases with a longer maximal radius of interaction.
51:2068:141444:39:16:78:555:76:7:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f21:44We say that natural advantages arefully transmissibleif whenj(i0)2 B-A(j(i))anddj(i);k< -AK, theni0
51:2069:141545:16:0:69:417:60:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:receives utility equal toGAK(dj(i);k), the full value of the natural advantage toi.

52:2080:142399:15:14:69:557:521:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:individual records of all patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark O¢ ce

52:2083:142669:14:14:69:557:479:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Our analysis only considers industrial patents and the citations among them (e.g., we exclude

52:2085:142835:14:15:86:556:451:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:We discuss in Section 3 the literature that exploits patent citations to measure knowledge

52:2088:143115:14:14:69:557:408:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:codes based on business directories and web-based searches.  This data development process
52:2089:143205:14:14:69:557:394:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:requires extensive manual e§ort as the San Francisco Bay Area produced as many industrial

52:2100:144100:14:14:69:557:238:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:is marked with a star. This zip code produced the most industrial patents of any zip code in
52:2101:144192:14:14:69:557:224:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the San Francisco Bay Area (more than 20,000, which is equal to the seventeenth largest state).
52:2102:144287:14:15:69:557:210:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:It is home to Örms like Intel, Sun, Advanced Micro Devices, and Applied Materials. The other

52:2106:144654:17:14:82:557:150:7:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:1Our approach has several limitations. First, the vast majority of web searches yield current business addresses.
52:2107:144767:14:9:69:557:136:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:In some cases, these searches also yield historical addresses for Örms that have been acquired or gone out of
52:2108:144876:9:10:69:557:127:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:business, but addresses are nonetheless more likely to be found for Örms currently in operation. Second, even
52:2109:144985:10:9:69:557:117:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:within the San Francisco Bay Area, some Örms have multiple facilities. In such cases, our top priority is for
52:2110:145094:9:10:69:557:108:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:locations where research is performed. Our results are robust when multiple assignments are possible to either
52:2111:145204:10:9:69:353:98:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:using the most likely facility or to weighting each facility equally.
52:2112:145273:9:10:79:557:89:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:A second source of address information comes from parallel work matching Örms into the Census Bureau data

53:2117:145759:14:14:69:557:685:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the periphery (47%). Likewise, the relative importance of external citations within the focal zip
53:2118:145856:14:14:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:code declines as one moves to the periphery. It averages 10% across the region. In total, about
53:2119:145951:14:14:69:557:657:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:17% of external citations for the Örms are contained in the San Francisco Bay Area. This share
53:2120:146045:14:14:69:557:643:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:is greater than the more typical 10% share found at the metropolitan level due to both a larger
53:2121:146140:14:15:69:525:629:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:expanse of land considered and due to this region being the dominate technology cluster.
53:2122:146228:15:14:86:556:614:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Panel B further incorporates the second and third largest zip codes and their technology
53:2123:146316:14:14:69:557:600:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:sourcing.  The second largest zip code is 95134, home to Örms like Altera, Micron, and Cisco.
53:2124:146409:14:14:69:557:586:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:It has reciprocal sourcing from 95054, and it draws extensively from its neighbors 95035 and
53:2125:146501:14:14:69:557:572:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:95124. The third largest zip code is 94304 (e.g., Hewlett-Packard, Incyte, Palo Alto Research
53:2126:146594:14:14:69:557:558:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Center). Its technology sourcing extends down to include 95014 (e.g., Apple, Tandem, GTE)
53:2127:146683:14:15:69:322:544:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and 95120 (e.g., IBM Almaden Research Center).
53:2128:146729:15:14:86:556:529:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Panels C and D show the top 6 and 10 zip codes, respectively. Although unrestricted in
53:2129:146815:14:14:69:557:515:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:design, the primary technology sourcing zones for each zip code in the core are also contained
53:2130:146909:14:14:69:557:501:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:in the core. This is true for all of the 18 zip codes in the core that are among the top 25. These
53:2131:147007:14:14:69:557:487:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:zones are characterized by small, overlapping regions that often exhibit directional transmission.
53:2132:147105:14:14:69:557:473:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:No technology sourcing zone spans the entire core. In larger maps, we represent the core as a
53:2133:147198:14:15:69:557:459:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:shaded triangle, and for visual ease we will no longer maintain the micro technology áows. Panel
53:2134:147294:15:14:69:463:444:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:D shows the boundaries of this triangle; its longest side is 25 miles in length.

53:2138:147643:14:15:69:557:388:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:not contained in the core itself (numbers 12, 13, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 25). The shape of each
53:2139:147735:15:14:69:557:373:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:technology sourcing zone is again determined by the three zip codes that Örms in the focal zip
53:2140:147829:14:14:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:code cited most in their work. For visual ease, San Ramon and Santa Clara are indicated on the
53:2141:147923:14:14:69:428:345:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:edge of the map at the location of their primary transportation route.
53:2142:147993:14:14:86:556:331:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Similar to the core, these zones are characterized by small, overlapping regions that often
53:2143:148084:14:14:69:557:317:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:exhibit directional transmission. The northwestern portion is a good example of the phenomena
53:2144:148177:14:15:69:557:303:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:our theory describes. The orange zone (also labelled with a ì1î) for Menlo Park extends deepest
53:2145:148272:15:14:69:557:288:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:into the core. The green zone for Redwood City (ì2î) shifts up and encompasses Menlo Park
53:2146:148361:14:14:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and Palo Alto but less of the core. The black zone for South San Francisco (ì3î) further shifts
53:2147:148456:14:14:69:557:260:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:out and brushes the core. The northern side is similar. Fremontís pink zone extends deepest
53:2148:148547:14:14:69:557:246:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:through the core, while points further out attach more to the coreís edge. Finally, Santa Claraís
53:2149:148644:14:14:69:305:232:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:zone connects up the eastern edge of the core.
53:2150:148690:14:15:86:556:218:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:The background of the map demonstrates the roles of geographical features and transporta-
53:2151:148779:15:14:69:557:203:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:tion costs. The shape of the core and outlying technology zones are dictated by mountains,
53:2152:148869:14:14:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:protected land, and the bay. Likewise, the edges of sourcing zones conform to major transporta-
53:2153:148964:14:14:69:557:175:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:tion routes. Highway networks play a central role (e.g., horizontal áows across the top of the
53:2154:149058:14:14:69:557:161:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:core, vertical áows on the eastern edge of the core). Bridges help cross the bay. While not

53:2156:149242:14:15:69:439:133:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:transportation routes, govern the technology áows within the core itself.
53:2157:149315:15:14:86:556:118:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:The length of each zone is ináuenced by congestion. The distance along the upper edge of
53:2158:149403:14:14:69:557:104:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the orange zone from Menlo Park into the core is 14 miles with an estimated travel time of 28
53:2159:149496:14:14:69:557:90:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:minutes. The distance along the upper edge of the black zone from South San Francisco to Menlo
53:2160:149590:14:0:69:557:76:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Park is 20 miles but with a comparable travel time of 32 minutes. A full spatial equilibrium
54:2161:149683:0:14:69:479:699:12:g_d0_f33:8:g_d0_f33:depends on additional factors like commercial and residential real estate prices.2

54:2165:150044:14:14:69:557:643:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the San Francisco region. We use citation data from about 70 zip codes to identify these zones.
54:2166:150139:14:15:69:557:629:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:These zip codes are subject to minimum requirements for counts of patent, citations, and Örms.

55:2249:154779:15:14:69:557:331:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:substantial deviation from the random draws. Our estimation procedure analyzes these local

55:2255:155233:14:14:69:557:222:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:distances between establishments.  The county spatial unit is the most detailed spatial unit
55:2256:155325:14:15:69:557:208:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:available for establishments in the LBD. We collapse establishment counts and employments

55:2260:155691:14:14:69:557:151:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:ture. Establishments in the same county are given a uniform distance of one mile. Multiple
55:2261:155781:14:14:69:557:137:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:factors yield conáicting recommendations regarding this latter choiceó for example, accounting

56:2275:156953:15:14:69:557:561:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to the extent they are more spatially clustered than US establishments generally. In preparing
56:2276:157047:14:14:69:557:547:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:this test, it is important that each counterfactual have a similar number of observations (and
56:2277:157141:14:14:69:557:533:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:therefore precision) as the focal distribution. It is also important, given the random nature of
56:2278:157237:14:14:69:557:519:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the establishment draw, to replicate the counterfactual baseline multiple times. DO converge on

56:2280:157405:14:15:86:556:491:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Computational restrictions require that we simplify how the conÖdence bands are calculated.
56:2281:157496:15:14:69:557:476:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Our Örst simpliÖcation is that we only calculate conÖdence bands using data from 1977 and
56:2282:157585:14:14:69:557:462:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:1997, rather than annually as in the base index calculation above. These two years are chosen
56:2283:157678:14:14:69:557:448:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:as sample end points when economic censuses are conducted using the SIC system.  When
56:2284:157763:14:14:69:557:434:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:calculating our agglomeration measures, we Önd very similar patterns across all years 1976-2001
56:2285:157858:14:14:69:557:420:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:when using either the 1977 or 1997 baselines. Our current discussion focuses just on the 1977
56:2286:157951:14:15:69:475:406:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and 1997 cross-sections, and the conÖdence intervals are speciÖc to these years.
56:2287:158031:15:14:86:556:391:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Second, we approximate the establishment count in the industry. Industries di§er substan-
56:2288:158120:14:14:69:557:377:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:tially in their establishment counts, ranging in 1997 from 18 industries having fewer than 100
56:2289:158214:14:14:69:557:363:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:establishments to 12 industries having more than 100,000. The maximum number of establish-
56:2290:158304:14:14:69:557:349:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:ments was over 400,000 for Eating and Drinking Places (581). It is computationally prohibitive
56:2291:158398:14:14:69:557:335:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to match exactly the establishment count in all industries and years. We thus randomly draw
56:2292:158489:14:15:69:557:321:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:without replacement 100,000 establishments for a hypothetical industry; this sampling is re-
56:2293:158581:15:14:69:284:306:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:peated 1000 times in both 1977 and 1997.
56:2294:158621:14:14:86:556:292:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:We then calculate sub-draws of these samples using increments of 100 establishments from
56:2295:158709:14:14:69:557:278:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:a smallest industry size of 100 establishments up to 1500 establishments (i.e., 100, 200, ...,
56:2296:158803:14:14:69:557:264:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:1500). In addition, we calculate sub-draws using increments of 500 establishments from 1500
56:2297:158894:14:15:69:557:250:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:establishments to 5000 establishments and increments of 10,000 establishments up to 100,000
56:2298:158985:15:14:69:557:235:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:establishments. This procedure creates 32 comparable industry counts ranging from 100 estab-
56:2299:159077:14:14:69:557:221:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:lishments to 100,000 establishments.  As this procedure is repeated in two years and for 1000
56:2300:159170:14:14:69:557:207:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:samples, 64,000 random baselines are created. Industries are paired with constructed conÖdence
56:2301:159264:14:14:69:557:193:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:bands that most closely reáect the underlying observation counts (e.g., an industry with 223
56:2302:159356:14:14:69:459:179:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:establishments is compared to the conÖdence bands for 200 establishments).

56:2305:159608:14:14:69:557:136:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:we then identify the 50th and 950th extreme values in the smoothed series. We designate these

56:2308:159899:13:9:69:557:90:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:small at this level, however. We obtain equivalent results if pairwise establishment distances are capped at 3,000
56:2309:160013:9:10:69:557:81:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:miles, which is roughly the distance from Miami, FL, to Seattle, WA. The correlation for capped and uncapped
56:2310:160121:10:0:69:158:71:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:distributions is 0.99.

57:2329:160776:15:14:69:557:494:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:views them symmetrically. This combined index is convenient for graphs and empirical analyses
57:2330:160869:14:31:69:478:480:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and continues to satisfy the necessary properties of an agglomeration estimator.
57:2331:160949:31:21:69:317:449:14:g_d0_f32:14:g_d0_f32:Global Localization and Dispersion
57:2332:160983:21:15:69:557:428:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Most industries exhibit local clustering or dispersion at one distance or another. The DO ap-
57:2333:161076:15:14:69:557:413:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:proach therefore also calculates indices of global localization and dispersion. These measures
57:2334:161170:14:14:69:557:399:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:quantify sustained deviations from the baselines of random placement.  The procedure Örst
57:2335:161259:14:14:69:466:385:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:speciÖes a distance threshold to analyze, and we denote this threshold asthr.
57:2336:161336:14:14:86:556:371:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:After deÖning the thresholdthr, the DO approach Örst looks for evidence of substantial
57:2337:161422:14:15:69:557:357:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:localization up to the threshold. If localization is not evident by the threshold, then evidence for
57:2338:161522:15:14:69:557:342:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:global dispersion is sought up to the threshold. If an industry is spatially distributed similarly to
57:2339:161623:14:14:69:557:328:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:overall economic activity, neither global localization nor dispersion will be found. This multi-step
57:2340:161723:14:14:69:557:314:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:procedure and omission of distances beyond the threshold is deÖned in this way since density
57:2341:161815:14:14:69:557:300:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:functions sum to one over the support. Thus, localization in one distance range will correspond
57:2342:161910:14:14:69:232:286:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to dispersion in other distances.

57:2369:162640:14:14:86:557:74:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Thus,KGCI-UA;thr(d)andKGCI-LA;thr(d)are speciÖc to the industry and threshold studied. The
57:2370:162730:14:0:69:557:60:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:global bands depend upon the industry studied as the counterfactual random draws replicate
58:2371:162821:0:14:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the number of establishments by industry.  Industries with fewer establishments have wider
58:2372:162911:14:14:69:557:685:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:conÖdence bands. While not included in DOís original formulation, the global bands also depend
58:2373:163005:14:14:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:on the threshold analyzed. ConÖdence bands are wider for longer intervals studied; equivalently,
58:2374:163101:14:14:69:426:657:12:g_d0_f33:8:g_d0_f33:the local conÖdence intervals become tighter with greater thresholds.4
58:2375:163171:14:14:86:556:643:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:When studying the UK, DO employ a distance threshold for identifying localization of 180
58:2376:163259:14:15:69:560:629:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:kilometers, which is the median distance among UK manufacturing establishments. The USí

58:2378:163443:14:14:69:557:600:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and the appropriate threshold is not dictated by theory. There is also a question of edge e§ects
58:2379:163539:14:14:69:557:586:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:as discussed in Harrison and Kominers (2008). 1000 miles is approximately the median distance
58:2380:163632:14:14:69:557:572:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:between US establishments and is on the order of magnitude for the distance between Detroit,
58:2381:163724:14:14:69:557:558:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:MI, and Dallas, TX. The 25th, 10th, and 3rd percentiles of establishment bilateral distances are
58:2382:163820:14:15:69:557:544:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:approximately 500, 250, and 100 miles, respectively. These are on the order of magnitude of
58:2383:163911:15:14:69:485:529:12:g_d0_f33:8:g_d0_f33:Detroit, MI, to Washington, DC, Cincinnati, OH, and Lansing, MI, respectively.5
58:2384:163990:14:14:86:556:515:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:We therefore calculate global localization and dispersion across increments from 25 miles to
58:2385:164082:14:14:69:557:501:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:1000 miles. The 100 mile threshold is of comparable distance to the UK hurdle employed by DO
58:2386:164174:14:14:69:557:487:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:(180 kilometers = 112 miles), while 1000 miles maintains the median concept. Finally, we again

58:2391:164441:15:14:69:557:379:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:thresholds increase from 50 miles in Panel A to 1000 miles in Panel E. Within each panel,

58:2393:164624:14:14:69:557:351:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:typically higher in employment-weighted distributions than in those using plant counts (e.g.,

58:2395:164812:14:14:69:557:323:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and employment is 0.7. Employment-weighted distributions and estimates for 1977 are available

58:2399:165103:14:14:69:557:266:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:display non-zero dispersion. 10% of industries show zero global localization and dispersion, and
58:2400:165199:14:14:69:557:252:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:about 25% of industries show minimal deviation from the baseline economic activity of LBD
58:2401:165288:14:14:69:424:238:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:establishments (i.e., localization or dispersion values less than 0.001).
58:2402:165361:14:15:86:556:224:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:At Örst it may appear odd that 60% of industries are deemed globally localized when the
58:2403:165448:15:17:69:557:209:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:conÖdence bands are selected such that only 5% of the counterfactuals reach them.  This is
58:2404:165538:17:14:82:557:192:7:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:4Our procedure creates a grid of conÖdence bands by industry size and distance threshold for 1977 and 1997.
58:2405:165645:14:9:69:557:178:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:The industry sizes are the 32 interval ranges outlined earlier. We calculate exact global bands for eight thresholds
58:2406:165761:9:10:69:557:169:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:and use linear interpolation for distance thresholds between them. These eight thresholds and the extreme values
58:2407:165873:10:11:69:557:159:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:used for them are: 1000 miles (5th/995th), 500 (6/994), 375 (7/993), 250 (9/991), 175 (10/990), 100 (13/987),
58:2408:165982:11:11:69:557:148:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:75 (14/986), and 50 (18/982). As a comparison, DO also Önd that the 10/990 extreme values are appropriate
58:2409:166087:11:9:69:557:137:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:for 5% global conÖdence bands at a threshold of approximately 100 miles in their UK sample. These extreme
58:2410:166192:9:10:69:557:128:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:values are assigned through analyses of the complete distributions for the random draws of 100, 1000, 10,000,
58:2411:166301:10:9:69:557:118:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:and 100,000 establishments and are most representative for 1000 establishments. Appropriate extreme values
58:2412:166407:9:11:69:557:109:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:tend to widen (i.e., move to greater extremes) with large industry size due to the interaction of randomness and

58:2414:166620:8:15:82:557:90:7:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:5More precisely, the percentiles of unweighted establishment distances in 1997 are 1013 miles (50th), 573

58:2416:166832:9:0:69:310:66:10:g_d0_f33:10:g_d0_f33:weighted percentiles are shorter than count percentiles.
59:2417:166889:0:14:69:557:699:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to be expected if agglomeration forces exist, however, as the counterfactuals are built upon all
59:2418:166985:14:14:69:557:685:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:industrial establishments. The counterfactuals are not selected such that only 5% of industries
59:2419:167080:14:14:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:will be deemed agglomerated. This result is expected if, as in our model, sites are distributed
59:2420:167175:14:14:69:397:657:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:uniformly but agglomerative forces exist in nearly all industries.
59:2421:167241:14:14:86:556:643:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Moving from Panel A to Panel E, the share of industries that are localized and the values
59:2422:167330:14:15:69:557:629:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:of their localization increase as the distance threshold increases.  By 1000 miles, 88% of in-
59:2423:167424:15:14:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:dustries exhibit localization. Our combined metric (4) also increases in value four fold. This
59:2424:167518:14:14:69:557:600:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:is again despite the fact that the conÖdence intervals are being continually widened at longer
59:2425:167612:14:14:69:557:586:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:thresholds to maintain only 5% of the counterfactual series reaching them. This conÖrms the
59:2426:167703:14:14:69:557:572:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:modelís implication that an increase in the distance horizon should typically lead to increased
59:2427:167798:14:14:69:144:558:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:agglomeration.
59:2428:167812:14:15:86:556:544:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Unreported analyses Önd that these patterns also hold within each one-digit SIC sector up to
59:2429:167904:15:14:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:1000 miles. It is important to note, however, that global localization can decrease across some
59:2430:167999:14:14:69:557:515:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:distance ranges. For example, law o¢ ces can be concentrated at short distances within each city
59:2431:168095:14:14:69:557:501:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:but also present in many cities. A short threshold captures the initial spike. As the threshold
59:2432:168190:14:14:69:557:487:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:lengthens, the conÖdence intervals against which the densities are compared widen. This results
59:2433:168285:14:14:69:557:473:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:in a weaker measured concentration and, in some case, even a determination that the industry
59:2434:168377:14:15:69:245:459:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:is not globally concentrated at all.
59:2435:168413:15:14:86:556:444:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Table 1B describes the local deviations that are behind these patterns.  We also graph
59:2436:168499:14:14:69:557:430:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:in the main paper the fraction of industries that are localized at each distance level to 1000
59:2437:168593:14:14:69:557:416:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:miles. Localization is most powerful at short distance horizons, with substantial attenuation
59:2438:168686:14:14:69:557:402:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:commencing after 125 miles or so. Whereas about 60% of industries show localization at short
59:2439:168778:14:15:69:557:388:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:spatial scales, only 30% or thereabouts are localized at distances of 900-1000 miles. This pattern
59:2440:168876:15:14:69:557:373:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:is predicted in our model so long as some agglomerative force exists. Manufacturing industries
59:2441:168970:14:14:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:are more agglomerated at short spatial scales than non-manufacturing industries, a pattern that
59:2442:169065:14:14:69:557:345:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:reverses at longer horizons. This is to be expected given the transportable and tradeable nature
59:2443:169161:14:14:69:204:331:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:of manufactured products.
59:2444:169186:14:14:86:556:317:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Tables 2A-2D document extreme localization and dispersions values for 1997. Table 2A be-
59:2445:169274:14:15:69:557:303:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:gins with the global metric. Some industries are extremely localized regardless of the threshold
59:2446:169370:15:14:69:557:288:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:chosen. Most prominently, many of the tobacco, textiles, and apparel industries are very concen-
59:2447:169466:14:14:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:trated in the southeast of the US; moreover, these industries are very concentrated spatially at
59:2448:169562:14:14:69:557:260:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:small distances within this region. Other cases are due to very concentrated natural advantages
59:2449:169657:14:14:69:557:246:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:(e.g., mining industries) or idiosyncrasies in deÖnitions (e.g., freight transport on Great Lakes).
59:2450:169756:14:14:86:556:232:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:On the other hand, some industries are quite localized at small distances but have clusters
59:2451:169847:14:15:69:557:218:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:throughout the country. Many of the Önance industries and professional services, for example,
59:2452:169940:15:14:69:557:203:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:fall into this pattern. They have extreme values at small distances but not at larger distances.
59:2453:170036:14:14:69:557:189:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:A third pattern is where industries are not very locally clustered but tend to congregate in
59:2454:170128:14:14:69:557:175:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:one region of the US. This may again follow from natural advantages (e.g., regional oil and gas
59:2455:170223:14:14:69:518:161:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:deposits) or from Marshallian interactions among Örms (e.g., metalworking machinery).
59:2456:170308:14:14:86:556:147:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Table 2B similarly documents extreme dispersion values. The dispersed industries are intu-
59:2457:170398:14:15:69:557:133:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:itive. Many represent services and trade that require homogeneous distribution like gas stations,
59:2458:170495:15:14:69:557:118:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:hotels, hospitals, and utilities. Other dispersed industries like lumber and concrete are associated
59:2459:170595:14:14:69:557:104:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:with transportation of heavy products, which limits the advantages of even local agglomeration.
59:2460:170690:14:0:69:557:90:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:A third rationale is cheaper available land for dealers of used cars, mobile homes, and similar.
60:2461:170787:0:14:69:555:699:12:g_d0_f33:8:g_d0_f33:These purchases are substantial enough that consumers are willing to travel to the dealerships.6
60:2462:170883:14:14:86:556:685:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Tables 2C and 2D repeat this analysis using the localization metrics by distance. These tables
60:2463:170977:14:14:69:557:671:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:provide some simple intuition for the behavior described by our model. The localized concentra-
60:2464:171072:14:14:69:557:657:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:tion and dispersion at 50 miles is naturally closely aligned with the global levels noticed earlier.
60:2465:171172:14:14:69:557:643:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Most of the localized industries at 50 miles, however, are among the most dispersed industries
60:2466:171266:14:15:69:557:629:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:when looking at concentric rings farther away. This is most easily seen in comparing the list of
60:2467:171362:15:14:69:557:614:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:highly localized industries at 50 miles to highly dispersed industries at 1000 miles. There are
60:2468:171457:14:14:69:557:600:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:also several cases of industries dispersed at short distances that show abnormal concentration
60:2469:171551:14:14:69:363:586:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:at moderate to longer distances horizons (e.g., hospitals).
60:2470:171610:14:14:86:556:572:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Industry movements across the panels can identify underlying forces of agglomeration and
60:2471:171698:14:14:69:557:558:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:their spatial scales. This behavior is embedded in global concentrations metrics, like Tables 2A
60:2472:171794:14:15:69:557:544:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and 2B, but is even more prominent in localized density functions. These local density functions
60:2473:171890:15:14:69:557:529:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:describe the edge of Örm location decisions in ways that aggregate agglomeration functions
60:2474:171980:14:14:69:491:515:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:obscure. This gradient or edge is the central piece that we study in the main text.
60:2475:172063:14:14:86:556:501:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Table 3A documents the correlation of the combined concentration metric (4) by threshold.
60:2476:172152:14:14:69:557:487:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:The correlation is very high among small thresholds and longer thresholds, but weaker in be-
60:2477:172244:14:14:69:557:473:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:tween. Index values using a 50 mile threshold have a 0.98 correlation with those using a 100 mile
60:2478:172341:14:15:69:557:459:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:threshold. The correlation of the 50 mile threshold to a 375 mile threshold, however, declines
60:2479:172435:15:14:69:557:444:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to 0.81. From here, the correlation only further declines to 0.73 when examining a 1000 mile
60:2480:172527:14:14:69:120:430:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:threshold.
60:2481:172537:14:14:86:556:416:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:Table 3B documents the correlation for local deviations. There is a much faster attenuation
60:2482:172628:14:14:69:557:402:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:of the correlation in local deviations across neighboring distances than for the global metric,
60:2483:172723:14:15:69:557:388:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:and a negative correlation exists for very distant values. These features are to be expected as
60:2484:172818:15:14:69:557:373:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:the underlying kernel densities sum to one over the support. Excess density in one distance
60:2485:172909:14:14:69:557:359:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:range yields below average density in another distance range. The non-linear summation be-
60:2486:172999:14:14:69:557:345:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:hind the global metric in Table 3A, however, will typically continue to identify an industry as
60:2487:173094:14:14:69:515:331:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:agglomerated at longer distance thresholds once it is agglomerated at lower thresholds.
60:2488:173181:14:14:86:557:317:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:The correlation between industry size and-CAis on the order of -0.1. Smaller industries are
60:2489:173272:14:15:69:557:303:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:typically slightly more localized. The adjustment of conÖdence bands insures that this is not due
60:2490:173369:15:14:69:557:288:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:to greater randomness in the series with fewer observations. It is more of an economic feature
60:2491:173463:14:14:69:557:274:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:that descends from why the industry has a small number of plants (e.g., economies of scale in
60:2492:173556:14:14:69:556:260:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:manufacturing versus consumer-oriented services). We have separately analyzed-CAvalues at
60:2493:173645:14:14:69:557:246:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:several thresholds for di§erent size industries. Growth in industry size is always associated with
60:2494:173743:14:14:69:556:232:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:declining-CAvalues; likewise, longer distance thresholds are associated with greater-CAvalues
60:2495:173836:14:126:69:163:218:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f33:in all size buckets.

61:2507:175070:12:12:37:479:28:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:core are also contained in the core.  These zones are small, overlapping regions that often exhibit directional 
61:2508:175182:12:0:37:497:16:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:transmission.  In larger maps, we represent the core as a shaded triangle whose longest side is 25 miles in length.

62:2526:176494:18:12:37:501:103:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:Similar to the core, these technology zones are characterized by small, overlapping regions that exhibit directional 
62:2527:176611:12:12:37:502:91:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:transmission.  The map also demonstrates the roles of geographical features (e.g., mountains, protected land) and 
62:2528:176725:12:12:37:504:79:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:transportation costs (e.g., highways, bridges).  These forces substantially govern the shape of the technology zones 
62:2529:176842:12:12:37:509:67:10:g_d0_f43:10:g_d0_f43:and access to the core.  These same features also play an important role in the technology flows evident in the core,

64:2579:179411:13:13:54:546:220:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Database of the US Census Bureau for 1997.  362 industries are defined through SIC3 classifications; all private, non-farm 
64:2580:179534:13:12:54:557:207:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:sectors are included in the sample.  The distance threshold for determining global localization or dispersion is adjusted across 
64:2581:179663:12:13:54:544:195:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:panels.  Within each panel, localization and dispersion statistics are calculated over observations displaying that trait.  The 
64:2582:179791:13:13:54:529:182:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:combined metric is calculated for all industries as the value of the localization metric minus the value of the dispersion 
64:2583:179914:13:12:54:529:169:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:metric.  The final row within each panel counts industries with approximately zero localization or dispersion.  The text
