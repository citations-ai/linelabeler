2:24:1207:29:28:273:338:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:F:ABSTRACT
2:25:1215:28:20:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We construct a model of simultaneous change and persistence in institutions. The model consists of
2:26:1313:20:20:71:539:575:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:landowning  elites  and  workers,  and  the  key  economic  decision  concerns  the  form  of  economic
2:27:1416:20:19:71:539:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:institutions regulating the transaction of labor (e.g., competitive markets versus labor repression).
2:28:1517:19:20:71:539:536:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:The main idea is that equilibrium economic institutions are a result of the exercise of de jure and de
2:29:1619:20:20:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:facto political power. A change in political institutions, for example a move from nondemocracy to
2:30:1717:20:20:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:democracy,  alters  the  distribution  of  de  jure  political  power,  but  the  elite  can  intensify  their
2:31:1827:20:20:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:investments in de facto political power, such as lobbying or the use of paramilitary forces, to partially
2:32:1932:20:19:71:539:456:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:or fully offset their loss of de jure power. In the baseline model, equilibrium changes in political
2:33:2032:19:20:71:539:437:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:institutions  have  no  effect  on  the  (stochastic)  equilibrium  distribution  of  economic  institutions,
2:34:2141:20:20:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:leading  to  a  particular  form  of  persistence  in  equilibrium  institutions,  which  we  refer  to  as
2:35:2248:20:20:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:invariance. When the model is enriched to allow for limits on the exercise of de facto power by the
2:36:2347:20:20:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:elite in democracy or for costs of changing economic institutions, the equilibrium takes the form of
2:37:2447:20:19:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:a Markov regime-switching process with state dependence. Finally, when we allow for the possibility
2:38:2546:19:20:71:539:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that changing political institutions is more difficult than altering economic institutions, the model
2:39:2647:20:20:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:leads to a pattern of captured democracy, whereby a democratic regime may survive, but choose
2:40:2740:20:20:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:economic institutions favoring the elite. The main ideas featuring in the model are illustrated using
2:41:2841:20:34:71:399:278:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:historical examples from the U.S. South, Latin America and Liberia.

3:63:3588:30:18:82:529:540:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Current empirical work and theoretical discussions of the impact of institutions on economic
3:64:3680:18:19:82:529:522:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:development either implicitly or explicitly assume that institutions persist (e.g., North, 1990,
3:65:3776:19:18:82:528:503:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001, 2002). In fact, some of
3:66:3866:18:18:82:529:485:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the most popular empirical strategies in gauging the effect of institutions on economic perfor-
3:67:3961:18:19:82:528:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:mance use the persistence of institutions over centuries as part of their conceptual approach
3:68:4054:19:18:82:529:448:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and identification strategy. But many aspects of “institutions” show substantial change over
3:69:4146:18:19:82:528:430:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:periods much shorter than a century. Many less-developed countries, especially those in Latin
3:70:4239:19:18:82:528:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:America and Africa, have changed their political institutions all too often over the past 100
3:71:4332:18:19:82:528:393:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:years, with frequent switches between democracy and dictatorship (see, e.g., Acemoglu and
3:72:4421:19:18:82:354:374:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:Robinson, 2006a) and multiple changes in constitutions.1
3:73:4477:18:18:99:528:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The same pattern also emerges when we turn to economic institutions. For example, while
3:74:4564:18:19:82:528:338:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:many historians and economists trace the economic problems of Latin America to colonial labor
3:75:4657:19:18:82:528:319:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:practices such as theencomiendaor themita, and those of the Caribbean to slavery and to the
3:76:4748:18:19:82:529:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:plantation complex, all of these economic institutions vanished long ago.2Beneath this pattern
3:77:4842:19:18:82:528:282:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of change, however, economic systems often show surprising continuity. The form of agricul-
3:78:4933:18:19:82:528:264:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tural labor relations in many of the Latin American and Caribbean countries changed little
3:79:5023:19:18:82:529:245:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:after colonialism, and perhaps relatedly, these societies continued to suffer various economic
3:80:5117:18:18:82:529:227:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:problems, slow growth, and economic and political instability throughout the 20th century.
3:81:5207:18:19:82:528:209:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Another interesting example comes from the U.S. South. Even though slavery was abolished
3:82:5295:19:18:82:528:190:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:at the end of the Civil War, the U.S. South maintained a remarkably similar agricultural sys-
3:83:5388:18:16:82:528:172:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tem, based on large plantations and low-wage uneducated labor, and remained relatively poor
3:84:5479:16:15:95:529:156:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:1For instance, Colombia had 8 constitutions in the 19th century (Gibson, 1948), while Bolivia had 11 (Trigo,
3:85:5587:15:7:82:284:141:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:1958) and Peru 9 (Palacios and Guillergua, 2003).
3:86:5636:7:15:95:529:134:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:2In Latin America, the last form of official forced labor,pongueaje, was abolished in Bolivia in 1952 (Klein,
3:87:5745:15:11:82:529:119:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:1992, Chapter 8). Unpaid labor services lasted in Guatemala until 1945 (McCreery, 1994). Slaves were gradually
3:88:5855:11:11:82:529:108:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:freed, for example in 1850 in Colombia. In the British Caribbean slavery was abolished after 1834, though it
3:89:5963:11:0:82:275:97:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:lasted until in 1886 in Cuba and 1888 in Brazil.
4:90:6012:0:18:82:256:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:until the middle of the 20th century.
4:91:6049:18:18:99:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we provide a possible explanation for this paradoxical pattern of the coexis-
4:92:6141:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tence of frequent changes in political institutions with the persistence in certain (important)
4:93:6236:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aspects of economic institutions.3Our approach illustrates the possibility of two different types
4:94:6333:18:19:82:532:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of persistence. The baseline model leads to a pattern which we refer to asinvariance,whereby
4:95:6425:19:18:82:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a change in political institutions from nondemocracy to democracy leads to no change in the
4:96:6516:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(stochastic) equilibrium process of economic institutions and of the distribution of resources
4:97:6610:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in society. Simple extensions of our baseline model lead to a richer form of persistence, which
4:98:6705:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we refer to asstate dependence; the probability that a society will be democratic (and have
4:99:6796:18:19:82:523:535:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:pro-citizen economic institutions) tomorrow is a function of whether it is democratic today.4
4:100:6889:19:18:99:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The underlying idea of our approach is that equilibrium economic institutions emerge from
4:101:6978:18:19:82:533:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the interaction between political institutions, which allocatede jure political power,andthe
4:102:7070:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:distribution ofde facto political poweracross social groups (see Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006a,
4:103:7164:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2005b). De Facto power is power that is not allocated
4:104:7253:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by institutions (such as elections), but rather ispossessed by groups as a result of their wealth,
4:105:7351:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:weapons or ability to solve the collective action problem. A change in political institutions
4:106:7444:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that modifies the distribution of de jure power need not lead to a change in the equilibrium
4:107:7536:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:process for economic institutions if it is associated with an offsetting change in the distribution
4:108:7635:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of de facto political power (e.g., in the form of bribery, capture of the political parties, or use of
4:109:7737:19:18:82:528:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:paramilitaries). The central argument in this paper is that there is a natural reason to expect
4:110:7832:18:18:82:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:changes in the distribution of de facto political power to partially or entirely offset changes
4:111:7927:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in de jure power brought about by reforms in specific political institutions as long as these
4:112:8020:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reforms do not radically alter the political structure of society, the identity of the elites, or the

4:114:8161:19:18:99:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To make these ideas precise, we develop a model consisting of two groups, a landed elite
4:115:8249:18:16:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the citizens. The key economic institution concerns the organization of the labor mar-

4:117:8444:15:11:82:528:209:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:enforcement of property rights for a broad cross-section of society. Lack of property rights enforcement may have
4:118:8557:11:11:82:529:198:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:its roots in quite different specific economic institutions, for example, risk of expropriation by the government
4:119:8670:11:11:82:529:187:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:or elites; extreme corruption; economic systems such as serfdom or slavery preventing large segments of the
4:120:8777:11:11:82:528:176:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:population from selling their labor freely or from investing in most economic activities; legal rules making it
4:121:8888:11:11:82:528:165:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:impossible for those without political connections to have their contracts enforced; or entry barriers creating a

4:123:9024:7:15:95:528:147:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:4We refer to this type of persistence as “state dependence”since the probability distribution over equilibrium
4:124:9134:15:11:82:528:132:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:political and economic institutions tomorrow depends on the “state” of the system, which is political institutions
4:125:9248:11:10:82:529:121:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:today. See Page (2006) for a discussion of richer forms of persistence in political systems, where the past entire
4:126:9362:10:0:82:500:111:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:sequence of events, rather than simply a low-dimensional state vector, might influence future outcomes.
5:127:9466:0:18:82:529:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ket, in particular, whether wages are competitive or are repressed below this level.5In the
5:128:9557:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model, economic institutions are decided either by the landed elite or the citizens (workers)
5:129:9650:18:19:82:529:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:depending on who has more political power. Political power, in turn, is determined by both
5:130:9740:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political institutions that allocate de jure power and the distribution of de facto power, which
5:131:9836:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is derived, at least partly, from a social group’s ability to solve their collective action problem.
5:132:9936:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:A key observation is that landowners, by virtue of their smaller numbers and their established
5:133:10030:18:19:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:position, have a comparative advantage in solving the collective action problem (Mosca, 1939,
5:134:10123:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Olson, 1965). This implies that the amount of de facto political power of the elite is an equi-
5:135:10218:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:librium outcome, and responds to incentives. Nevertheless, political institutions and de jure
5:136:10311:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political power also matter for equilibrium outcomes. For example, in democracy de jure po-
5:137:10402:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:litical power is allocated to the majority, so the balance of power is tilted towards the citizens
5:138:10500:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(see Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006a). In addition, freedom of political organization and the
5:139:10590:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:existence of political parties may help the citizens in solving their collective action problem
5:140:10685:18:18:82:435:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more effectively, thus facilitating their exercise of de facto political power.
5:141:10764:18:19:99:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In the model society, in every period there is a “contest” between the elite and the citizens,
5:142:10858:19:18:82:529:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and political institutions (democracy versusnondemocracy) determine how level the playing
5:143:10947:18:19:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:field is in this contest.  Those with greater political power determine economic institutions
5:144:11040:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:today and political institutions tomorrow. The most interesting result of our framework is
5:145:11130:18:19:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that, because the elite’s de facto political power is an equilibrium outcome, it will partly or
5:146:11225:19:18:82:528:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:entirely offset the effect of changes in political institutions. In particular, the elite will invest
5:147:11326:18:18:82:440:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more in their de facto political power in democracy than in nondemocracy.
5:148:11399:18:19:99:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In the baseline model, this effect is sufficiently strong that the distribution of equilibrium
5:149:11493:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions is identical in democracy and nondemocracy–thus leading to the pattern
5:150:11585:18:19:82:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of invariance defined above.6This pattern shows that it could be mistaken to infer from
5:151:11672:19:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:frequent changes in certain dimensions of political institutions that there is little institutional
5:152:11771:18:19:82:534:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:persistence.  The result also starkly illustrates how changes in some specificdimensionsof
5:153:11861:19:18:82:529:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political institutions can be undone by the greater exercise of de facto political power by the
5:154:11956:18:18:82:105:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite.
5:155:11962:18:19:99:528:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Even though in this baseline model the equilibrium probability distribution of economic
5:156:12049:19:18:82:528:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions is independent of whether the society is democratic or nondemocratic, this prob-
5:157:12142:18:16:82:529:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ability distribution is still affected by economic fundamentals. The comparative static results
5:158:12237:16:15:95:529:132:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:5Although this setup is natural from the view point of Latin American history, it is not essential to the
5:159:12342:15:7:82:111:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:results.
5:160:12350:7:15:95:529:110:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:6To be precise, therearechanges in economic institutions, but theequilibrium distributionof economic
5:161:12450:15:0:82:276:95:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:institutions isinvariantto political institutions.
6:162:12501:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:illustrate this. The most interesting among these is that the economic structure of the society,
6:163:12597:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for example the presence of sectors competing with agriculture for labor, will have a major
6:164:12688:18:19:82:529:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the equilibrium. The more productive are these sectors, the less the elite have to gain
6:165:12785:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from using repressive methods, and the more likely it is that institutions favor the citizens.
6:166:12879:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the smaller the numbers of the elite, the more cohesive they are and the more able they
6:167:12974:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:will be to solve the collective action problem and choose the institutions they favor. Finally,
6:168:13069:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and more paradoxically, the political advantage created by a democracy for the citizens may
6:169:13160:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lead to a greater domination of politics by the elite. This result followsbecause the democratic
6:170:13256:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:advantage of the citizens creates a future cost for the elite and they are willing to invest more in
6:171:13356:18:19:82:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:activities to increase their de facto power to avoid this future cost.7However, when democratic
6:172:13451:19:18:82:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions create a sufficiently large political advantage for the citizens (i.e., when they are
6:173:13549:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:“sufficiently strong”), the nature of the equilibrium changes qualitatively, and democracy may
6:174:13643:19:18:82:212:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:become an absorbing state.
6:175:13669:18:18:99:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The invariance result, that the de facto political power of the elite canentirelyoffset
6:176:13756:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of changes in political institutions, is special. In the rest of the paper, we extend
6:177:13852:19:18:82:529:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:our baseline model in a number of ways to show how, more generally, the de facto political
6:178:13942:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power of the eliteonly partiallyundoes the effect of changes in political institutions, leading
6:179:14037:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to an equilibrium with a Markov regime-switching structure. The two extensions we consider
6:180:14127:18:19:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:allow democracy to place limits on the exercise of de facto power by the elite (e.g., limits on
6:181:14222:19:18:82:529:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their use of paramilitaries or co-option of politicians) and introduce the feature that changing
6:182:14318:18:18:82:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions may be difficult in the short run (e.g., because the democratic regime
6:183:14410:18:19:82:529:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:has already implemented some changes favoring the citizens). Both of these extensions lead
6:184:14500:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to an equilibrium structure where the society switches between democracy and nondemocracy,
6:185:14590:18:19:82:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with different sets of economic institutions in the two regimes, and exhibits state dependence
6:186:14684:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(so that nondemocracy is more likely to follow nondemocracy than it is to follow democracy).
6:187:14776:18:19:99:535:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we analyze a richer model in which political institutions are moredurable,in
6:188:14861:19:18:82:529:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:thesensethat,indemocracy,itismoredifficult for the elite to change political institutions
6:189:14950:18:18:82:529:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:B:than economic institutions. This model leads to a phenomenon which we refer to ascaptured
6:190:15039:18:19:82:528:185:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy; the equilibrium may feature the emergence and persistence of democracy for a
6:191:15126:19:15:82:528:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:long span of time, but throughout the economic institutions will be those favoring the elite. In
6:192:15222:15:15:95:529:151:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:7It is also interesting that in this baseline model, there is greater inefficiency in democracy than in non-
6:193:15330:15:11:82:528:136:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:democracy, because in democracy the economic allocations are the same as in nondemocracy, but there is
6:194:15432:11:11:82:529:125:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:greater exercise of de facto political power by the elite,which is costly. This result suggests some insights about
6:195:15547:11:11:82:529:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:why certain potential reforms in specific political institutions in many less-developed countries may have failed
6:196:15660:11:11:82:529:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to generate significant economic growth and also perhaps about why the post-war economic performance of
6:197:15763:11:0:82:424:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:democracies may have been no better than those of dictatorships (e.g., Barro, 1997).
7:198:15848:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:fact, somewhat paradoxically, this extended model predicts that the equilibrium probability
7:199:15939:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of labor-repressive institutions is higher in democracy than in nondemocracy, motivating the
7:200:16031:18:19:82:207:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:term captured democracy.
7:201:16055:19:18:99:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The model also sheds some light on how institutional persistence can be diminished or
7:202:16140:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:broken.  It suggests that an effective democracy requires both reforms in specific political
7:203:16232:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions (such as voting rules or electoral procedures), but also a way of curbing the de
7:204:16325:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:facto political power of the elite, which can be achieved directly, for example, by reducing their
7:205:16423:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ability to capture the political system, or indirectly by reforming the economic structure so
7:206:16516:18:18:82:442:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that with reduced land rents, they have less incentive to thwart democracy.
7:207:16591:18:19:99:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The model’s insights enable us to interpret the experience of many less developed countries
7:208:16682:19:18:82:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in a different light. For example, in the Americas, labor repression was of central importance
7:209:16776:18:19:82:534:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:during the colonial era, and was achieved by various means including theencomienda,the
7:210:16862:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:mita, and slavery.  Yet repression did not end when themitaand slavery were abolished.
7:211:16948:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:It continued with domination of politics by local landed elites, with the creation of labor
7:212:17039:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:market monopsonies (Solberg, 1969, McGreevey, 1971, Coatsworth, 1974, McCreery, 1986),
7:213:17125:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the systematic threat of violence against peasants in rural areas. Similarly, in the sugar
7:214:17219:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:plantations of the British Caribbean, Natal or Mauritius, slavery was replaced by the use of
7:215:17311:19:18:82:528:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cheap indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent (Tinker, 1974, Northrup, 1995). In the
7:216:17404:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. South, slavery was replaced by monopsonistic arrangements, policies designed to impede
7:217:17495:19:18:82:469:350:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:labor mobility, political disenfranchisement, intimidation, violence and lynching.8
7:218:17578:18:18:99:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper is related to the literature on the persistence of institutions in political science
7:219:17672:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., Steinmo, Thelen and Longstreth, 1992, Pierson, 2004, Thelen, 2004), though much of
7:220:17761:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:this literature focuses on how specific institutions persist over long periods of time. In this
7:221:17856:18:19:82:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:it follows works on ‘hysteresis’ by David (1985) and Arthur (1989) on the lock-in of specific
7:222:17949:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:technologies based on increasing returns. In addition to these approaches, persistence of insti-
7:223:18045:18:19:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tutions can arise in models in which social conventions or norms emerge from local interactions
7:224:18140:19:18:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and learning (e.g., Young, 1998, Bednar and Page, 2006), and in models in which agents make
7:225:18231:18:16:82:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specific investments in activities whose value would be destroyed by changes in social arrange-
7:226:18326:16:15:95:529:187:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:8This discussion and the general approach in the paper beg the question of how the elite are able to exercise
7:227:18435:15:11:82:528:172:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:de facto political power in democracy. This is also discussed in detail in Section 7, where we present a number
7:228:18546:11:11:82:529:161:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:of historical case studies illustrating the pattern ofpersistence modeled here and also emphasize two specific
7:229:18656:11:11:82:528:150:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:channels: the capture of the party system by the elites and the threat of violence. Both these methods were
7:230:18763:11:11:82:528:139:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:extensively used in the U.S. South after the Civil War and are still present in many Latin American countries
7:231:18872:11:10:82:528:128:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:such as Brazil, Bolivia or Colombia. For the U.S. South after the Civil War, see Key (1949), Woodward (1955),

8:235:19278:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:existence of multiple steady-state equilibria (e.g., Krugman, 1991, Matsuyama, 1991). The
8:236:19367:18:19:82:529:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:popular idea that economic inequality or certain forms of natural resource endowments tilt
8:237:19457:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the balance towards bad institutions is also different from our notion of persistence (invariance
8:238:19554:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and state dependence), since this idea stresses the persistence of economic characteristics that
8:239:19650:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:then lead to the persistence of institutions (e.g., Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997, Benabou, 2000,
8:240:19745:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:2005). None of these approaches have addressed the issues we discuss here, in particular, the
8:241:19838:19:18:82:264:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:coexistence of persistence and change.
8:242:19876:18:18:99:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:From a modeling point of view, this paper extends the framework in Acemoglu and Robin-

8:244:20058:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the future distribution of de jure political power.9The major difference is that we now
8:245:20149:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model the process of the elite investing in their de facto political power, which leads to some
8:246:20244:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant differences in the results. While our previous work emphasized that democracy is

8:249:20507:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:related to Mulligan, Gil and Sala-i-Martin (2004) and Mulligan and Tsui (2005), which focus
8:250:20598:18:19:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:on similarity of various policies between democracies and nondemocracies, though, in terms
8:251:20688:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of our terminology, they explain this similarity by lack of significant de jure power differences
8:252:20785:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:between regimes, while our model emphasizes how changes in de facto power can undo real

8:255:20981:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political environment.  Section 3 characterizes the equilibria of the baseline model, and es-

8:257:21166:18:19:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:framework in a number of directions and shows how under more general circumstances, only
8:258:21254:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:partial offset will occur, and the equilibrium will correspond to a Markov regime-switching
8:259:21345:18:19:82:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model, withfluctuations between democracy and nondemocracy.  Section 5 introduces the
8:260:21430:19:18:82:529:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model in which changing political institutions is more difficult than influencing economic in-

12:419:27963:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:on the analysis, and throughout, one may wish to consider the labor repressive institutions as
12:420:28057:18:29:82:311:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding to “worse economic institutions”.

12:422:28155:26:18:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:There are two possible political regimes, denoted byDandN, corresponding to democracy
12:423:28240:18:19:82:528:609:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and nondemocracy. The distribution of de jure political power will vary between these two
12:424:28329:19:18:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regimes. At any point in time, the “state” of this society will be represented byst∈{D,N},
12:425:28419:18:18:82:528:572:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which designates the political regime that applies at that date. Importantly, irrespective of
12:426:28512:18:19:82:528:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the political regime (state), the identity of landowners and workers does not change; the same
12:427:28606:19:18:82:526:535:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:Mindividuals control the land, and have the potential to exercise additional political power.
12:428:28699:18:19:99:528:517:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Overall political power is determined by the interaction of de facto and de jure political
12:429:28789:19:18:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power. Since there is a continuum of citizens, they will have difficulty in solving the collective
12:430:28887:18:18:82:528:480:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:action problem to exercise de facto political power. Consequently, we treat their de facto power
12:431:28983:18:19:82:425:462:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as being exogenous rather than stemming from their own contributions.
12:432:29052:19:18:99:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast, elites can spend part of their earnings to gather further de facto political power.
12:433:29148:18:19:82:529:425:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, suppose that elitei∈Espends an amountθit≥0as a contribution to activities

12:440:29393:27:29:280:528:358:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:PEt=φZt,(13)
12:441:29405:29:18:82:529:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:whereφ>0.  The reason why the elite may choose to spend a positive amount on such
12:442:29486:18:19:82:528:311:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:activities is that there is afinite number,M, of them, so each of them will take into account
12:443:29579:19:18:82:529:292:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that their own contribution to total spending,Zt,willhaveaneffect on equilibrium outcomes.
12:444:29669:18:19:82:528:274:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:An important assumption implicit in (13) is that the technology for generating de facto political
12:445:29766:19:18:82:397:255:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:power for the elite is the same in democracy and nondemocracy.14
12:446:29830:18:18:99:528:237:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Even though the citizens cannot solve the collective action problem to invest in their de

12:448:30016:19:18:82:528:200:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power. The extent of this power depends on whether the political regime is democratic or
12:449:30104:18:19:82:528:182:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:nondemocratic.  We model the citizens’ total political power in a reduced-form manner as
12:450:30192:19:18:82:117:163:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:follows:
12:451:30200:18:17:249:528:145:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:PCt=ωt+ηI(st=D),(14)
12:452:30220:17:14:91:529:128:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:14There may be a number of reasons for why the elite’s ability to lobby and bribe politicians or use paramili-
12:453:30330:14:11:82:529:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:taries may be more restricted in democracy, so in Section 4, we allow this technology to differ between democracy
12:454:30443:11:0:82:160:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:and nondemocracy.

13:457:30633:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:st=D, such thatI(st=D)=1whileI(st=N)=0;andηis a strictly positive parameter
13:458:30708:19:18:82:310:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measuring citizens’ de jure power in democracy.
13:459:30755:18:19:99:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:There are two important assumptions embedded in equation (14). Thefirst is that the de
13:460:30841:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:facto political power of the citizensfluctuates over time, and is hard to predict in advance.15
13:461:30936:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The second assumption is that when the political regime is democratic, i.e.,st=D, citizens
13:462:31026:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:have greater political power. This represents in a very simple way the fact that democracy
13:463:31116:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:allocates de jure political power in favor of the majority. This will be both because of the
13:464:31208:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:formal rules of democracy and also because in democratic politics, parties may partly solve
13:465:31299:19:18:82:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the collective action problem of the citizens.  Put differently, equation (14) implies that in
13:466:31393:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy the political power of the citizens shifts to the right in the sense offirst-order
13:467:31485:19:26:82:520:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stochastic dominance. To simplify the discussion, we make the following assumptions onF:
13:468:31573:26:18:82:529:453:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:Assumption 2Fis defined over(ω,∞)for someω<0, is everywhere strictly increasing and
13:469:31656:18:19:110:528:435:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:twice continuously differentiable (so that its densityfand the derivative of the density,
13:470:31745:19:18:110:529:416:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:f0, exist everywhere). Moreover,f(ω)is single peaked (in the sense that there exists
13:471:31829:18:18:110:529:398:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:ω∗such thatf0(ω)>0for allω<ω∗andf0(ω)<0for allω>ω∗)andsatisfies

13:473:31905:26:19:99:529:354:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:All of the features embedded in Assumption 2 are for convenience, and how relaxing them
13:474:31992:19:18:82:281:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:affects the equilibrium is discussed below.
13:475:32035:18:19:99:528:317:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We introduce the variableπt∈{0,1}to denote whether the elite have more (total) political
13:476:32123:19:18:82:532:298:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power. In particular, whenPEt≥PCt,wehaveπt=0andtheelitehavemorepoliticalpower
13:477:32200:18:19:82:529:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and will make the key decisions. In contrast, wheneverPEt<PCt,πt=1and citizens have
13:478:32283:19:18:82:365:261:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more political power, and they will make the key decisions.
13:479:32342:18:18:99:529:243:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To complete the description of the environment, it remains to specify what these key
13:480:32426:18:19:82:528:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:decisions are. We assume that the group with greater political power will decide both economic
13:481:32520:19:18:82:522:206:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions at timet,τt, and what the political regime will be in the following period,st+1.
13:482:32613:18:19:99:529:188:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:When the elite have more political power, a representative elite agent makes the key deci-
13:483:32703:19:18:82:528:169:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sions, and when citizens have more political power, a representative citizen does so. Since the
13:484:32798:18:19:82:528:151:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political preferences of all elites and all citizens are the same, these representative agents will
13:485:32897:19:14:82:320:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:always make the decisions favored by their group.
13:486:32946:14:15:91:528:118:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:15This assumption is used extensively in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006a), and defended there. Briefly, given
13:487:33052:15:11:82:529:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:their large numbers, whether and how effectively citizens will be able to organize is difficult to predict in advance,
13:488:33170:11:0:82:438:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:and will change from time to time. The randomness ofωtcaptures this in a simple way.

14:490:33277:25:18:82:409:675:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We now briefly recap the timing of events in this basic environment.
14:491:33345:18:19:99:528:657:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:At each datet, society starts with a state variablest∈{D,N}. Given this, the following
14:492:33431:19:30:82:224:638:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sequence of events take place:
14:493:33461:30:19:96:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:1. Each elite agenti∈Esimultaneously chooses how much to spend to acquire de facto
14:494:33543:19:27:110:489:589:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:political power for their group,θit≥0,andPEtis determined according to (13).
14:495:33619:27:18:96:529:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:2. The random variableωtis drawn from the distributionF,andPCtis determined according
14:496:33704:18:28:110:146:544:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:to (14).
14:497:33712:28:18:96:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:3. IfPEt≥PCt(i.e.,πt=0), a representative (e.g., randomly chosen) elite agent chooses
14:498:33797:18:28:110:503:498:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f3:A:(τt,st+1),andifPEt<PCt(i.e.,πt=1), a representative citizen chooses(τt,st+1).
14:499:33874:28:18:96:529:470:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:4. Givenτt, transactions in the labor market take place,Rtandwtare paid to elites and

14:501:34009:27:35:96:339:425:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:5. The following date,t+1, starts with statest+1.
14:502:34058:35:29:82:297:390:209:g_d0_f4:209:g_d0_f4:C:3  Analysis of Baseline Model
14:503:34087:29:18:82:528:361:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We now analyze the baseline model described in the previous section. Wefirst focus on the
14:504:34176:18:19:82:529:343:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:symmetric Markov Perfect Equilibria (MPE). An MPE imposes the restriction that equilibrium
14:505:34266:19:18:82:535:324:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:strategies are mappings from payoff-relevant states, which here only includes∈{D,N}.In
14:506:34352:18:19:82:528:306:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:particular, in an MPE strategies are not conditioned on the past history of the game over and

14:515:34800:18:19:82:528:214:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:determines the equilibrium decision about labor repression conditional on who has power and

14:517:34977:18:19:82:528:177:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Symmetric MPE will in addition impose the condition that contribution functions take the
14:518:35065:19:16:82:529:158:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:formθ(s), i.e., do not depend on the identity of the individual elite,i. Symmetry is a natural
14:519:35159:16:15:91:529:142:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:16More generally, we could haveτ(π,s)ands0(π,s), so that the choice of economic institutions and future
14:520:35262:15:11:82:529:127:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:political institutions are conditioned on which party has political power,π, and the current state,s. Nevertheless,
14:521:35377:11:11:82:528:116:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:since it is clear that the current state will have no effect on these decisions, we use the more economical notation
14:522:35493:11:0:82:147:105:82:g_d0_f16:82:g_d0_f3:F:τ(π)ands0(π).
15:523:35508:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:feature here, and simplifies the analysis. We discuss asymmetric MPE for completeness below.
15:524:35600:18:18:82:352:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:A more formal definition of an MPE is also given below.
15:525:35655:18:19:99:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The focus on MPE is natural in this context as a way of modeling the potential collective
15:526:35744:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:action problem among the elite.  Looking at subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) will allow
15:527:35832:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the elite greater latitude in solving the collective action problem by using implicit punishment
15:528:35928:19:29:82:338:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:strategies. We briefly analyze SPEs in subsection 3.3.
15:529:35982:29:25:82:191:579:145:g_d0_f4:145:g_d0_f4:C:3.1  Main Results
15:530:35999:25:19:82:528:554:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The MPE can be characterized by backward induction within the stage game at some arbitrary
15:531:36089:19:18:82:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:datet, given the states∈{D,N}. At the last stage of the game, clearly whenever the elite have
15:532:36182:18:19:82:529:517:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political power, i.e.,π=0, they will choose economic institutions that favor them, i.e.,τ=0,
15:533:36274:19:18:82:536:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and a political system that gives them more power in the future, i.e.,s0=N.Incontrast,
15:534:36360:18:18:82:528:480:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:whenever citizens have political power, i.e.,π=1, they will chooseτ=1ands0=D.17
15:535:36439:18:19:82:528:462:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This implies that choices over economic institutions and political states are straightforward.
15:536:36533:19:18:82:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover the determination of market prices under different economic institutions has already
15:537:36626:18:19:82:529:425:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:been specified above (recall equations (8)-(11)). Thus the only remaining decisions are the
15:538:36717:19:18:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:contributions of each elite agent to their de facto power,θit. Therefore, a symmetric MPE can
15:539:36810:18:19:82:529:388:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:be summarized by a level of contribution as a function of the stateθ(s). It will be convenient
15:540:36904:19:18:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to characterize the MPE by writing the payoffto elite agents recursively, and for this reason,
15:541:36998:18:18:82:528:351:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we denote the equilibrium value of an elite agent in statesbyV(s)(i.e.,V(D)for democracy
15:542:37086:18:19:82:228:333:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:andV(N)for nondemocracy).
15:543:37111:19:18:99:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Let us begin with nondemocracy. Since we arefocusing on symmetric MPE, suppose that

15:545:37288:19:29:82:458:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:toθ(N). Consequently, when agenti∈Echoosesθi,theirtotalpowerwillbe

19:791:44523:0:18:82:529:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:A more technical intuition for this result is that the optimal contribution conditions for elite
19:792:44619:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:agents both in nondemocracy and democracy equate the marginal cost of contribution, which
19:793:44708:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is always equal to 1, to the marginal benefit. Since the marginal costs are equal, equilibrium
19:794:44802:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:benefits in the two regimes also have to be equal. The marginal benefits consist of the im-

19:796:44981:19:18:82:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:independent of current regime. Consequently, marginal costs and benefits can only be equated

19:817:45750:31:18:82:529:350:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:Proposition 1(Invariance)Suppose Assumptions 1-3 hold. Then in the baseline model,
19:818:45832:18:19:82:533:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:there exists a unique symmetric MPE. This equilibrium involvesp(D)=p(N)∈(0,1),so
19:819:45912:19:18:82:528:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that the probability distribution over economic institutions is non-degenerate and independent
19:820:46006:18:30:82:345:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of whether the society is democratic or nondemocratic.
19:821:46060:30:19:99:529:265:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:A:Proof.Assumption 3 ensures thatθ(D)=0andθ(N)=0cannot be part of an equi-
19:822:46132:19:18:82:534:246:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:librium. Since Assumption 2 implies thatf(ω)is continuous andlimω→∞f(ω)=0,both

19:826:46465:19:18:82:529:172:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:follows from Assumption 2, which imposes thatFis strictly increasing throughout its support,
19:827:46557:18:18:82:529:154:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:so for any interiorθ(D)andθ(N),F(φMθ(D)−η)=F(φMθ(N))<1. In addition, again

20:832:46947:18:18:82:322:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:establishes the uniqueness of the symmetric MPE.
20:833:46995:18:19:99:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This proposition is one of the main results of the paper. It shows that there will be equi-

20:837:47358:18:19:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of de jure power, but they donottranslate into changes in the law of motion of economic insti-

20:840:47638:18:19:82:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:distribution over equilibrium economic institutions remains unchanged. This result also illus-

20:843:47907:28:18:82:529:470:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:Remark 1As will be discussed further below, the invariance result relies on functional form
20:844:47998:18:19:82:529:452:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions. Section 4 will show that when there are differences in the technology of generating

20:847:48280:18:19:82:529:397:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:partially. Other assumptions implicit in our analysis that are important for the invariance
20:848:48371:19:18:82:529:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:result are: (1) that democracy shifts the power of the citizens additively (rather thanωbeing

20:852:48730:19:18:82:528:304:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the general insight that endogenous changes in de facto power (at least partially) offset declines

20:854:48920:28:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:Remark 2Assumptions 2 and 3 can be relaxed without affecting the basic conclusions in
20:855:49005:18:18:82:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Proposition 1. For example, if we relax the single-peakedness assumption onf(ω), the conclu-
20:856:49097:18:19:82:528:222:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sions in Proposition 1 would continue to apply, except that the symmetric MPE may no longer
20:857:49188:19:18:82:529:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:be unique. Multiple equilibria here are of potential interest, as they correspond to situations in
20:858:49286:18:19:82:529:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which expectations of future behavior affects current behavior (see, e.g., Hassler et al., 2003).
20:859:49383:19:18:82:529:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Also, if the parts of Assumption 2 thatFis increasing everywhere andlimω→∞f(ω)=0are

21:896:50914:18:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(26),F(−η)=0, which establishes the existence of a symmetric MPE withp(N)∈(0,1)and
21:897:50996:18:19:82:130:240:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:p(D)=0.
21:898:51003:19:18:99:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Therefore, if we relax part of Assumption 3, symmetric MPEs with democracy as an ab-
21:899:51087:18:19:82:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sorbing state may arise. Clearly, Condition (26), which leads to this outcome, is more likely
21:900:51180:19:18:82:529:184:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to hold whenηis high. This implies that if democracy in fact creates a substantial advantage
21:901:51272:18:18:82:528:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in favor of the citizens, it may destroy the incentives of the elite to engage in activities that
21:902:51369:18:19:82:529:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increase their de facto power, and thus change the future distribution of political regimes and
21:903:51464:19:18:82:186:129:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions.
21:904:51486:18:19:99:528:111:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:It is also interesting to note that even when Condition (26) holds, the equilibrium with
21:905:51574:19:0:82:529:92:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:p(D)=p(N)>0characterized in Proposition 1 may still exist, leading to a symmetric MPE
22:906:51661:0:18:82:529:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:withp(D)=p(N). Consequently, whether democracy becomes an absorbing state (i.e., fully
22:907:51747:18:18:82:291:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:consolidated), may depend on expectations.
22:908:51789:18:28:99:529:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, inspection of the proof of Corollary 1 shows that Assumption 3 can be relaxed to:

23:1093:54939:18:18:82:529:212:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:implies that in non-symmetric MPE, different levels ofp(D)=p(N)can arise in equilibrium.

25:1254:58701:18:19:82:529:474:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:this model. Our focus is on SPEs that maximize the ex ante–timet=0–utility of the elite.
25:1255:58789:19:18:82:528:455:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This is natural since we are motivated to look at the SPEs to see how the ability of the elite
25:1256:58883:18:18:82:528:437:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to coordinate their actions changes the results. We define best or “Pareto optimal” SPEs as
25:1257:58974:18:19:82:529:419:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:SPEs in which, at timet=0, no elite agent can be made better offwithout some other elite
25:1258:59062:19:18:82:529:400:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:agent being made worse off.23In addition, we refer to an SPE as “symmetric Pareto optimal”,
25:1259:59153:18:19:82:529:382:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:if it is Pareto optimal and all elite agents use the same equilibrium strategy. The main result
25:1260:59248:19:30:82:157:363:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is the following:

25:1262:59341:18:19:82:529:315:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1-3 hold. Then there exists ̄β∈[0,1)such that that for allβ≥ ̄β, the symmetric Pareto optimal
25:1263:59434:19:18:82:529:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:SPE induces equilibrium probabilities of labor repressive institutionsp(D)=p(N)∈(0,1).
25:1264:59520:18:31:82:450:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, asβ→1, any Pareto optimal SPE involvesp(D)=p(N)∈(0,1).
25:1265:59584:31:18:99:207:247:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:A:Proof.See Appendix.
25:1266:59603:18:19:99:528:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This proposition therefore shows that as long as the discount factor is large enough, the
25:1267:59692:19:18:82:528:210:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:“best” SPEs also give the same invariance result as the MPEs. Intuitively, with a high enough
25:1268:59785:18:18:82:528:192:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:discount factor, the elite act totally cohesively, as a single agent, and the same calculus as in
25:1269:59882:18:19:82:528:174:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the MPE applies for equating the marginal cost of greater contributions to de facto power to
25:1270:59974:19:18:82:529:155:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the marginal benefits, again implyingp(D)=p(N). When the discount factor is sufficiently
25:1271:60062:18:19:82:528:137:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:small, however, this result may no longer be true, because a different pattern of contributions
25:1272:60157:19:16:82:529:118:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:may be necessary to ensure “incentive compatibility” on the side of the elite agents (i.e., to

26:1277:60509:25:19:82:528:628:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We now return to the symmetric MPE and derive a number of comparative static results.

26:1286:60909:19:18:82:529:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the only difference between democracy and nondemocracy for the elite is that in democracy

26:1288:61092:18:19:82:529:475:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, the per elite additional spending is equal toη/φM, which is increasing in the de

26:1311:61524:29:18:99:532:304:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f8:A:Finally, let us denote the probability that the elite will have political power byp∗=p(D)=

28:1401:64580:18:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Sincef0<0, this implies thatφMθ∗(N)increases, sop∗=F(φMθ∗(N))also increases,

28:1403:64678:19:18:99:529:534:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, it is straightforward to verify that the effect ofφonθ∗(N)andθ∗(D)is ambiguous.

28:1413:64811:15:29:370:390:487:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f9:C:=1,
28:1414:64814:29:19:82:528:458:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f8:B:we see that an increase inφincreases the second term on the left-hand side, sof(φMθ∗(N))
28:1415:64902:19:18:82:528:439:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f8:B:has to decline. Sincef0<0,thisimpliesthatφMθ∗(N)increases, andp∗=F(φMθ∗(N))
28:1416:64977:18:19:82:293:421:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:must also increase, establishing∂p∗/∂φ >0.
28:1417:65019:19:18:99:528:402:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Many of the comparative statics in Proposition 4 are intuitive, and yet quite useful in terms
28:1418:65112:18:19:82:528:384:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of economic implications. For example, the fact that an increase in∆Rinduces both greater
28:1419:65201:19:18:82:528:365:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:contributions by elite agents and also increases the probability that they control political
28:1420:65293:18:18:82:528:347:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power is very intuitive, since∆Ris a measure of how much they have to gain by controlling
28:1421:65382:18:19:82:528:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political power. The greater is this gain, the more willing is each elite agent to contribute to
28:1422:65478:19:18:82:529:310:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their collective political power.24Since∆Rwill be high whenAis low, Proposition 4 also
28:1423:65564:18:19:82:529:292:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:implies∂p∗/∂A <0. In other words, in a society where alternative (e.g., proto-industrial)
28:1424:65653:19:18:82:529:273:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic activities are less developed and where, by repressing labor the elite can obtain
28:1425:65743:18:19:82:529:255:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large rents, political and economic institutions are more likely to be controlled by the elite,
28:1426:65838:19:18:82:529:236:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and consequently economic institutions are more likely to be tilted towards repressive labor
28:1427:65930:18:18:82:322:218:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:relations rather than competitive labor markets.25
28:1428:65980:18:19:99:528:200:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Thefactthatahigherβalso increases contributions by the elite and the likelihood of labor
28:1429:66068:19:18:82:529:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:repressive institutions is also interesting. Inmany models, a higher discount factor leads to
28:1430:66161:18:19:82:528:163:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:better allocations. Here, in contrast, a higher discount factor leads to more wasteful activities
28:1431:66258:19:15:82:528:144:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by the elite and labor repressive economic institutions. The reason is that the main pivotal
28:1432:66350:15:15:91:529:129:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:24Thisfinding is also in line with the empirical literature on collective action whichfinds that it is more likely
28:1433:66464:15:7:82:276:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:when the benefits are higher (e.g., Wade, 1988).
28:1434:66512:7:15:91:529:107:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:25The fact that the elite can never impose slavery, thus taking away the outside option of the workers, is
28:1435:66618:15:0:82:292:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:naturally important for the result that∂p∗/∂A <0.
29:1436:66669:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:agents in this model are the elite, which, by virtue of their smaller numbers, take the effect of
29:1437:66766:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their contributions on equilibrium allocationsinto account. Contributing to de facto political
29:1438:66860:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power is a form of investment, and some of the returns accrue to the elite in the future (when
29:1439:66954:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:they secure nondemocracy instead of democracy). Therefore a higher level ofβencourages
29:1440:67040:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:them to invest more in their political power and makes nondemocracy and labor repressive
29:1441:67128:19:18:82:242:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions more likely.
29:1442:67162:18:19:99:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The third set of comparative statics show that whenMincreases so that there are more
29:1443:67246:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite agents, the collective action problem among them becomes worse. This highlights the
29:1444:67335:18:18:82:529:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:latent free-rider problem in the model. Even though each elite agent contributes to the group’s
29:1445:67430:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political power, their level of contribution is still suboptimal from the viewpoint of the group,
29:1446:67527:19:18:82:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:since each elite agent realizes that by contributing more he creates a positive externality on
29:1447:67621:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:other elites. A greaterMincreases the extent of this positive externality and intensifies the
29:1448:67714:19:18:82:528:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:free-rider problem (the collective action problem). This comparative static therefore suggests
29:1449:67808:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that nondemocracy and labor repressive economic institutions are more likely to emerge when
29:1450:67899:18:19:82:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:there is a relatively small and cohesive group of elite land owners, a pattern consistent with
29:1451:67993:19:18:82:285:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the historical case studies discussed below.
29:1452:68037:18:19:99:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The most surprising comparative static results are those with respect toη. Recall that a
29:1453:68125:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:higherηcorresponds to democracy giving more de jure power to the citizens. We may have
29:1454:68211:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:therefore expected a greaterηto lead to better outcomes for the citizens. In contrast, wefind
29:1455:68304:19:18:82:529:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that higherηmakes nondemocracy and labor repressive economic institutions more likely (as
29:1456:68393:18:18:82:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:long as Assumption 3 still holds). The reason for this is that a higherηmakes democracy
29:1457:68480:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more costly for the elite, so it is in the interest of each elite agent to invest more in the group’s
29:1458:68581:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political power to avoid democracy. This effect is strong enough to increase the probability
29:1459:68673:18:19:82:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that they will maintain political power. However, the overall impact ofηon the likelihood of
29:1460:68765:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy is non-monotonic: ifηincreases so much that Assumption 3 no longer holds, then
29:1461:68853:18:19:82:522:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Corollary 1 applies and democracy may become fully consolidated (i.e., an absorbing state).
29:1462:68944:19:18:99:529:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Note however that both the results that higherMreduces the political power of the elite
29:1463:69031:18:18:82:529:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and that higherηincreases their political power depend on the functional form assumptions
29:1464:69120:18:19:82:529:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:already highlighted in Remark 1.26Nevertheless, we believe that the baseline model we have
29:1465:69210:19:16:82:514:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is both the simplest and the most natural one, and highlights importantfirst-order effects.
29:1466:69301:16:15:91:531:150:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:26In particular, both the additive shift of the distribution function ofωindemocracyandthefactthat(13)is

29:1468:69512:11:10:82:532:124:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:is related to Esteban and Ray (2001), who emphasize that the effectofanincreaseinthenumberofagents
29:1469:69610:10:11:82:528:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to the total contribution of a lobby is ambiguous because, while each agent contributes less, there are more of
29:1470:69721:11:0:82:105:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:them.
30:1471:69728:0:18:99:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, whenφincreases, the technology of garnering de facto political power for the
30:1472:69813:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite improves. This may reduce their contributions to the group’s de facto power, but it will

30:1477:70079:29:19:82:528:564:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The model in the previous section yielded stark results, which were partly driven by the
30:1478:70167:19:18:82:528:545:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions that the elite had the same technology to generate de facto political power in both
30:1479:70262:18:18:82:528:527:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regimes and were able to change economic institutions immediately after they took control (in

30:1481:70447:19:18:82:528:490:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:leads to a richer form of persistence, in the form of a Markov regime-switching model with
30:1482:70537:18:19:82:528:472:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:state dependence. These issues are discussed in the next two subsections, and also pave the
30:1483:70628:19:18:82:487:453:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:way of our analysis of how to effectively reform equilibrium institutions in Section 6.
30:1484:70715:18:18:99:528:435:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Another special feature of the model in the previous section was that it implicitly assumed
30:1485:70806:18:19:82:528:417:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that changing economic institutions and changing the political system were equally easy (or
30:1486:70897:19:18:82:529:398:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:difficult). An extension in which changing political institutions may require greater political
30:1487:70992:18:19:82:470:380:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:power than influencing economic policies or institutions is discussed in Section 5.
30:1488:71075:19:29:99:528:361:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout the rest of the paper, to simplify the discussion, we focus on symmetric MPE.

30:1490:71205:25:19:82:529:307:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Ourfirst generalization of the above framework assumes that in democracy, because of limits

30:1493:71410:28:0:82:213:233:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f8:B:whereφD∈(0,φ)andZt=

30:1498:71437:0:22:255:528:237:65:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:27In other words, each unit of thefinal good spent by the
30:1499:71494:22:19:82:528:215:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite for increasing their de facto power is less effective in democracy than in nondemocracy.
30:1500:71588:19:18:82:528:196:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This is a reasonable assumption, since democraticinstitutions may prevent the elite from using
30:1501:71682:18:19:82:529:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:repression or paramilitaries or from buying politicians as effectively as in a nondemocratic
30:1502:71774:19:18:82:528:159:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regime.  Therefore, in this model democracy has two simultaneous functions; it shifts the
30:1503:71863:18:18:82:528:141:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of de jure political powers towards the citizens and it limits the exercise of de
30:1504:71957:18:16:82:198:123:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:facto power by the elite.
30:1505:71982:16:15:91:529:107:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:27We now write this asPEt(D)as opposed toPEtas in (13), since the technology of generating de facto
30:1506:72081:15:0:82:310:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:political power differs between the two political regimes.

39:2053:87535:0:18:99:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This proposition shows that in the environment with sluggish economic institutions the
39:2054:87621:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:main comparative static results from Proposition 4 regarding the effect of economic rents, the
39:2055:87715:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:discount factor and the cohesion of the landed elite continue to apply. Also interestingly, a
39:2056:87808:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:decrease inλ, meaning more sluggish economic institutions in democracy, increasesp∗(N).
39:2057:87895:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This is intuitive; a lowerλmeans that democracy is more costly for the elite, because it will
39:2058:87988:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:take time for them to impose their favorite economic institutions even when they take control
39:2059:88081:18:19:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in democracy. Consequently, the value of nondemocracy relative to democracy,V(N)−V(D),
39:2060:88167:19:18:82:529:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is higher, so in nondemocracy, the elite investmore in order to preserve this set of political
39:2061:88261:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions (and the associated labor repressive economic institutions). The implications of
39:2062:88354:18:19:82:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a decrease inλon the elite’s de facto power in democracy is ambiguous, since it reduces the
39:2063:88445:19:18:82:532:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:immediate benefits of taking control in democracy, but also, by increasingV(N)−V(D),it
39:2064:88531:18:35:82:231:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increases the long-run benefits.

39:2066:88619:29:18:82:528:434:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The assumption so far has been that when the elite have more political power than the citizens,
39:2067:88714:18:19:82:528:416:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:they can change both economic institutions and the political system (though in the previous
39:2068:88805:19:18:82:528:397:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:subsection, they could only change the economic institutions slowly). The historical examples
39:2069:88898:18:18:82:528:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:B:below illustrate a different salient pattern: democracy may emerge and endure, but in acap-
39:2070:88989:18:19:82:528:361:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:turedform, whereby the elite are able to impose their favorite economic institutions (or at the
39:2071:89084:19:18:82:528:342:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:very least, have a disproportionate effect on the choice of economic institutions) in an enduring
39:2072:89181:18:19:82:529:324:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy. It is therefore important to generalize the model so that there can be differences
39:2073:89274:19:18:82:350:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:between equilibrium political and economic institutions.
39:2074:89330:18:19:99:529:287:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:As discussed in detail in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006a), in many situations, political
39:2075:89416:19:18:82:529:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions are more difficult to change, and may have additional “durability”. We now mod-
39:2076:89508:18:18:82:529:250:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ify the baseline model to incorporate this feature and assume that overthrowing a democratic
39:2077:89600:18:19:82:529:232:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regime is more difficult than influencing economic institutions.  More specifically, the elite
39:2078:89694:19:18:82:529:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:require greater political power to force a switch from democracy to nondemocracy than sim-
39:2079:89784:18:19:82:528:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ply influencing economic institutions in democracy.  To simplify the discussion, we assume
39:2080:89874:19:18:82:528:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that when they influence economic institutions in democracy, they can choose their favorite
39:2081:89965:18:19:82:269:158:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions, labor repression.
39:2082:90005:19:0:99:529:139:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f9:A:Finally, for reasons that will become apparent below, we now assume that the timet

40:2092:90254:18:18:82:528:614:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the citizens from democracy (which may in turn be because of ideological reasons or a reduced-
40:2093:90348:18:19:82:528:596:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:form for other benefits provided to the citizens by democracy). Moreover, we will assume that
40:2094:90441:19:18:82:529:577:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:ν(S=D)is large enough that citizens always prefer and vote for democracy even when this
40:2095:90528:18:19:82:249:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:may have economic costs for them.
40:2096:90561:19:18:99:529:540:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f14:A:We model institutional change as follows. We assume that whens=DandPCt+ξ>PEt≥
40:2097:90638:18:19:82:529:522:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:PCt,whereξ>0, the elite can choose economic institutions but cannot change the political
40:2098:90726:19:18:82:529:503:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:system. If, on the other hand,PEt≥PCt+ξ, the elite can choose both economic institutions and
40:2099:90818:18:18:82:529:485:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the future political system. Symmetrically whens=NandPEt+ξ>PCt≥PEt, the citizens
40:2100:90898:18:19:82:529:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:can choose economic institutions, but cannot change the political system. This formulation
40:2101:90988:19:18:82:528:448:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:builds in the assumption that changing political institutions is more difficult than influencing
40:2102:91084:18:19:82:343:430:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions in the most straightforward way.
40:2103:91138:19:18:99:528:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout this section, we again focus on symmetric MPE. Also, to keep the issues sepa-
40:2104:91226:18:19:82:528:393:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:rate in this subsection, we assume that when the elite have more political power in democracy,
40:2105:91320:19:18:82:529:374:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:they can impose their most preferred economic institutions,τ=0, as in the baseline model.
40:2106:91409:18:30:82:421:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, to further simplify the discussion we strengthen Assumption 2:
40:2107:91480:30:19:82:529:326:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:Assumption 2’Fis defined over(ω,∞)for someω<0, is everywhere strictly increasing and
40:2108:91564:19:18:110:528:307:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:twice continuously differentiable (so that its densityfand the derivative of the density,
40:2109:91653:18:31:110:526:289:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:f0, exist everywhere), and moreover we havef0(ω)<0for allωandlimω→∞f(ω)=0.
40:2110:91727:31:18:99:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Given these assumptions, the structure of the model is similar to before. The value functions

42:2302:95634:18:19:99:528:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The interesting result in this case is that once the society becomes democratic, it will

43:2309:96177:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is captured in the sense that0<p(N)<p(D)<1, i.e., democracy will survive but choose
43:2310:96260:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic institutions in line with the elite’s interests with even a higher probability than does
43:2311:96357:19:30:82:153:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:nondemocracy.
43:2312:96370:30:29:99:505:578:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:A:Proof.The probability of labor repressive economic institutions under democracy is
43:2313:96452:29:29:190:421:549:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f9:C:p(D)=p(θ(D),θ(D)|D)=F(φMθ(D)−η),
43:2314:96484:29:19:82:129:520:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:while it is
43:2315:96495:19:24:200:410:501:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f8:C:p(N)=p(θ(N),θ(N)|N)=F(φMθ(N))
43:2316:96524:24:19:82:532:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in nondemocracy. Suppose, to obtain a contradiction, thatp(D)≤p(N). Thisisequivalent
43:2317:96608:19:18:82:92:458:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to
43:2318:96610:18:25:243:528:440:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:A:φMθ(D)−η≤φMθ(N).(58)
43:2319:96630:25:29:82:397:415:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Since from Assumption 2’fis decreasing everywhere, this implies
43:2320:96693:29:30:226:385:386:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f9:C:f(φMθ(D)−η)≥f(φMθ(N)).
43:2321:96715:30:29:82:349:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This equation combined with (56) and (57) implies that
43:2322:96769:29:29:207:404:327:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f9:C:f(φMθ(D)−η−ξ)≤f(φMθ(N)+ξ).
43:2323:96795:29:29:82:380:298:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Since from Assumption 2’fis decreasing, this is equivalent to
43:2324:96856:29:29:225:387:269:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f9:C:φMθ(D)−η−ξ≥φMθ(N)+ξ,
43:2325:96876:29:19:82:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which, givenξ>0, contradicts (58), establishing thatp(D)>p(N), i.e., that democracy is
43:2326:96962:19:18:82:127:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:captured.
43:2327:96971:18:19:99:530:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:But, by the same reasoning,p(D)>p(N)impliesf(φMθ(D)−η−ξ)>f(φMθ(N)+ξ),
43:2328:97040:19:18:82:529:184:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:thusφMθ(D)−η−ξ<φMθ(N)+ξ.SinceFis strictly monotonic, this impliesˆp(N)>ˆp(D),
43:2329:97117:18:18:82:330:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:establishing the Markov regime-switching structure.
43:2330:97168:18:19:99:529:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The equilibrium in this proposition is the richest and perhaps the most interesting one we
43:2331:97258:19:18:82:529:129:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:have encountered so far. The equilibrium still takes a Markov regime-switching structure with
43:2332:97351:18:19:82:528:111:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:fluctuations between democracy and nondemocracy; but in democracy, there is no guarantee
43:2333:97439:19:0:82:528:92:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that economic institutions will be those favored by the citizens.  While in all the previous
44:2334:97533:0:18:82:529:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:models we studied, the elite were able to imposeboththeirpoliticaland economic wishes at
44:2335:97621:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the same time, here we have an equilibrium pattern whereby democracy persists, but the elite
44:2336:97713:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are able to impose their favorite economic institutions. In fact, the proposition shows that
44:2337:97805:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(given Assumption 2’) the elite will be able to impose labor repressive economic institutions
44:2338:97898:18:19:82:400:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with ahigherprobability under democracy than in nondemocracy.
44:2339:97959:19:18:99:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition for this (somewhat paradoxical) result is that in democracy there is an addi-
44:2340:98050:18:19:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tional benefit for the elite to invest in de facto political power, which is to induce a switch from
44:2341:98150:19:18:82:529:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy to nondemocracy. Consequently, the elite invest in their de facto power sufficiently
44:2342:98244:18:18:82:529:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more in democracy that they are able to obtaintheir favorite economic institutions with a
44:2343:98333:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:greater probability.32Nevertheless, the elite are happierin nondemocracy, because the cost
44:2344:98423:19:18:82:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of investing in their de facto political power in democracy is significantly higher. In fact, it
44:2345:98519:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is precisely because they prefer nondemocracy to democracy that they are willing to invest
44:2346:98609:19:18:82:528:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more in their de facto political power in democracy and obtain the labor repressive economic
44:2347:98701:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions with a high probability. What about citizens? If there were no additional benefit
44:2348:98795:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of democracy,ν(S=D)>0, then citizens would actually be worse offin democracy than
44:2349:98876:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in nondemocracy, because they only care about economic institutions and economic institu-
44:2350:98965:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tions are more likely to be labor repressive in democracy than in nondemocracy. Thus when
44:2351:99054:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:ν(S=D)=0, citizens would never choose democracy, and would be happy to remain in non-
44:2352:99139:18:19:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy (given the limited ability that they have to solve the collective action problem).
44:2353:99231:19:18:82:528:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, the ideological or other benefits of democracy encapsulated inν(S=D)>0create
44:2354:99318:18:18:82:528:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the possibility of the captured democracy equilibrium, whereby the citizens are willing to vote
44:2355:99413:18:19:82:474:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and defend democracy, but democracy at the end caters to the wishes of the elite.
44:2356:99494:19:18:99:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Therefore, this model features both state dependence in political and economic institutions,
44:2357:99586:18:19:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and also coexistence of change in political institutions with persistence in economic institutions
44:2358:99684:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., the presence of labor repression in democracy). In fact, it is straightforward to see that
44:2359:99781:18:19:82:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the larger isξ, the more likely is the configuration with stable democracy choosing economic in-
44:2360:99877:19:18:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stitutions in line with the interests of the elite. Consequently, this model with durable political
44:2361:99976:18:18:82:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions and captured democracy provides both the richest set of predictions regarding the
44:2362:100070:18:19:82:528:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:persistence of economic and political institutions, and a potential explanation for the patterns
44:2363:100166:19:16:82:528:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:discussed in Section 7, which illustrate how many societies become and remain democratic,
44:2364:100255:16:15:91:529:150:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:32This result is not independent of functional form assumptions. For example, if we relax Assumption 2’, it
44:2365:100362:15:11:82:528:135:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:is possible to obtain an equilibrium with a semi-captured democracy where political institutions still follow a
44:2366:100473:11:10:82:528:124:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Markov-switching structure with state dependence, but the probability of labor repressive economic institutions
44:2367:100584:10:11:82:529:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:in democracy is positive but no higher than in nondemocracy, i.e.,p(N)≥p(D)>0. Nevertheless, relaxing
44:2368:100685:11:0:82:467:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Assumption 2’ does not guarantee that such an equilibrium will exist; it only makes it possible.
45:2369:100783:0:34:82:414:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:but continue to pursue policies that favor the traditional landed elite.

45:2371:100872:29:19:82:528:637:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we briefly discuss how institutional persistence can be broken by effective
45:2372:100964:19:18:82:528:618:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reforms. Our framework shows how the equilibrium path may feature invariance (i.e., labor

45:2374:101147:18:19:82:529:582:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that change the political organization of society) or state dependence (where dictatorship is
45:2375:101240:19:18:82:528:563:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to follow dictatorship than it is to follow democracy). Are there any major reforms
45:2376:101335:18:19:82:328:545:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that could break these various types of persistence?
45:2377:101387:19:18:99:529:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The comparative static results above suggest potential answers to this question. In par-
45:2378:101475:18:19:82:528:508:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ticular, the results so far show that a change in political institutions from nondemocracy to
45:2379:101568:19:18:82:528:489:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy is likely to be effective (in terms of leading to equilibrium competitive labor mar-

45:2381:101752:18:19:82:529:453:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:if democracy creates a substantial advantagefor the citizens in the form of a large value ofη,
45:2382:101846:19:18:82:528:434:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:then as shown by Corollary 1 this will end the cycle of institutional persistence and make the

45:2384:101992:19:18:99:529:397:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Second, one of the following reforms is undertakensimultaneouslywith the switch to democ-

45:2389:102463:19:18:82:529:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:achieve such an outcome). (2) a reduction in∆R, for example, by means of an increase in
45:2390:102550:18:19:82:528:287:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:A, which will reduce the potential rents that thelanded elites can obtain and will discourage
45:2391:102643:19:18:82:309:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:them from investing in de facto political power.
45:2392:102691:18:18:99:529:250:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This discussion therefore illustrates that while politics as business-as-usual may favor the
45:2393:102783:18:19:82:528:232:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite even in democracy, undertaking simultaneous and significant reforms may change the
45:2394:102871:19:18:82:529:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:character of the political equilibrium, makingdemocracy and competitive labor markets more
45:2395:102961:18:19:82:529:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:likely. An attractive example of simultaneous reform leading to a significant change in the

45:2397:103144:18:19:82:528:158:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:not only changed de jure power by dethroning the Stuart monarchy, but also by substantially
45:2398:103235:19:18:82:528:139:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increasing the role of the Parliament and the allocation of economic resources in society, ir-

46:2408:104005:18:19:82:528:545:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of coexistence of change in political institutions with persistence in the underlying economic
46:2409:104099:19:18:82:529:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:system, which has been the motivating empiricalpattern for our theoretical analysis. In all
46:2410:104190:18:18:82:528:508:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cases, we will interpret the historical events through the lenses of the models presented above,

46:2421:105009:18:19:99:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Before the Civil War, the South was significantly poorer than the U.S. average income at
46:2422:105097:19:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:about 70% of GDP per-capita (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992, Easterlin, 1960).34The
46:2423:105185:18:19:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:South lacked industry (Bateman and Weiss, 1981, Wright, 1986, Table 2.4, p. 27) and in 1860
46:2424:105276:19:15:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the total manufacturing output of the South was less than that of either Pennsylvania, New
46:2425:105366:15:15:91:529:206:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:33Although many features of the Southern economic system, such as the plantation system and the reliance on
46:2426:105473:15:11:82:529:191:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:low-wage labor, persisted, as Wright (1986) emphasizes, there were also important discontinuities, for example,
46:2427:105584:11:11:82:529:180:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the fact that the planter class transformed itself from “laborlords,” mostly relying on their slave property, to
46:2428:105696:11:7:82:426:169:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:“landlords,” more reminiscent to the large-scale plantation owners of South America.
46:2429:105780:7:15:91:529:162:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:34The relative poverty of the South has been hotly debated by scholars. Although Fogel and Engerman (1974)
46:2430:105886:15:11:82:528:147:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:pointed out that if the South had been an independent country in 1860 it would have been amongst the 10
46:2431:105989:11:11:82:528:136:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:richest in the world, the consensus view is that the South was relatively backward with poor institutions in 1860
46:2432:106102:11:11:82:528:125:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:(a view which in its modern form goes back at least to Genovese, 1965). To the extent that it was relatively
46:2433:106210:11:11:82:529:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:prosperous compared to other parts of the world at the time, this was because it had recently benefited from
46:2434:106318:11:11:82:528:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:a huge boom in cotton prices (Wright, 1978) and also because it was embedded in a society whose institutions
46:2435:106426:11:0:82:421:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:were formed in the 17th century, before the development of the plantation economy.
47:2436:106510:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:York or Massachusetts (Cobb, 1984, p.  6).  The South had very low rates of urbanization
47:2437:106598:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(around 9% as opposed to 35% in the Northeast) and relatively little investment in infrastruc-
47:2438:106692:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ture. For example, the density of railroads (miles of track divided by land area) was three times
47:2439:106789:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:higher in the North than in Southern states. The situation with respect to canal mileage was
47:2440:106881:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:similar (Wright, Table 2.1, p. 21). Perhaps more importantly, especially in the context of the
47:2441:106975:19:18:82:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:potential for future economic growth and industrialization, the South was not even innovative
47:2442:107068:18:19:82:271:590:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:for the sectors in which it specialized.35
47:2443:107110:19:18:99:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Although there is no consensus about why the South was backward, all scholars relate this
47:2444:107199:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in various ways to the planation economy and slavery.  Wright (1986) argues that because
47:2445:107287:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:slaves were a mobile asset, there was no incentive for planter interests to support investment
47:2446:107381:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in public goods such as infrastructure, and so manufacturing could not develop. Bateman and
47:2447:107472:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Weiss (1981) show that Southern planters did not invest in industry, even though the rate of
47:2448:107564:19:18:82:528:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return was superior to that in agriculture. A plausible explanation for the lack of innovation
47:2449:107658:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is that slavery limited the possibilities for productive investment. Slaves were forbidden to
47:2450:107751:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:own property or to become educated in most Southern states, presumably because this made
47:2451:107839:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:them easier to control. But this pattern of labor repression also condemned plantations to
47:2452:107929:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:low-skilled labor forces and possibly removed the incentives of planters to innovate. It is also
47:2453:108025:19:18:82:528:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:possible that the lack of urbanization and industry was a consequence of concerns about the
47:2454:108116:18:19:82:436:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:control of slaves and collective action, though Goldin (1976) disputes this.
47:2455:108192:19:18:99:528:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In the aftermath of the Civil War, the income per-capita of the South fell to about 50%
47:2456:108279:18:18:82:528:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the U.S. average. If the organization of the slave economy had been the reason why the
47:2457:108368:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:South had been relatively backward in 1865, one might have imagined that the abolition of
47:2458:108457:19:18:82:529:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:slavery in 1865 would have removed this blockage to Southern prosperity. The evidence and
47:2459:108546:18:19:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:historical interpretations show that the abolition of slavery had a surprisingly small effect on
47:2460:108642:19:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the Southern economy.36Though planters initially tried and failed to reintroduce the gang
47:2461:108731:18:19:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:labor system with the freed slaves, out of the ashes of the Civil War emerged a low wage labor
47:2462:108825:19:18:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:intensive economy based on labor repression. Cut offfrom the rest of the United States, income
47:2463:108919:18:18:82:529:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:per-capita remained at about half the average until the 1940s when itfinally began slowly to
47:2464:109011:18:16:82:529:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:converge.37Just as before the Civil War, there was systematic underinvestment in education
47:2465:109101:16:15:91:529:169:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:35For example, during the period 1837 to 1859 while the average numbers of patents issued per year relating
47:2466:109208:15:7:82:477:154:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to corn and to wheat were respectively 12 and 10, it was just 1 for cotton (see Schmookler, 1972).
47:2467:109306:7:15:91:529:147:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:36Despite this consensus, there is a debate on the related matter of why Southern incomes fell after the
47:2468:109410:15:11:82:529:132:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Civil War. The interpretation by Fogel and Engerman(1974) is based on the idea that the slavery system was
47:2469:109516:11:7:82:471:121:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:relatively efficient, though this has been challenged, see, for example, Ransom and Sutch (2001).
47:2470:109613:7:15:91:529:114:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:37Wright (1986, p. 70) notes “the isolation of the southern unskilled labor market was a basic background
47:2471:109718:15:0:82:416:99:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:condition for virtually the whole epoch between the Civil War and World War II.”

48:2473:109887:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Wright, 1986, p. 79). In 1900 all but two of the non-Southern states had enacted compulsory
48:2474:109978:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:schooling laws, while none had such laws in the South except Kentucky (Woodward, 1951, p.
48:2475:110067:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:399). Though industrial development did beginmore systematically after 1865, Cobb (1984,
48:2476:110155:18:31:82:143:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:p. 17) notes:

48:2483:110634:18:19:82:529:474:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:B:economic institutions appears at odds with the significant changes in the distribution ofde

48:2485:110816:18:18:82:528:437:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:freed slaves, and the repeal of the Missouri compromise, which had previously cemented the

48:2488:111050:18:19:82:528:382:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the exercise of de facto political power by the Southern landed elites to compensate for the
48:2489:111142:19:18:82:528:363:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss of their de jure political power.39Consistent with our approach, there was considerable
48:2490:111234:18:19:82:529:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:persistence in the identity and power of the political elites. For example, Wiener (1978) studied
48:2491:111331:19:18:82:528:326:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the persistence of the planter elite in 5 counties of the black belt of western Alabama. Tracking
48:2492:111428:18:18:82:528:308:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:families from the U.S. census and considering those with at least $10,000 of real estate, he found
48:2493:111526:18:19:82:528:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that (p. 9) “of the 236 members of the planter elite in 1850, 101 remained in the elite in 1870.”
48:2494:111623:19:18:82:529:271:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Interestingly, this rate of persistence was very similar to that experienced in the antebellum
48:2495:111717:18:19:82:529:253:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:period; “of the 236 wealthiest planters families of 1850, only 110 remained in the elite a decade
48:2496:111814:19:18:82:528:234:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:later” (p.  9).  Nevertheless, “of the 25 planters with the largest landholdings in 1870, 18
48:2497:111906:18:17:82:527:216:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(72%) had been in the elite families in 1860; 16 had been in the 1850 elite group.”40Table
48:2498:111996:17:11:91:517:199:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:38Kousser (1974, p. 17) records a post-bellum adage “To educate a ‘nigger’ is to spoil a goodfield hand.”
48:2499:112101:11:14:91:529:188:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:39Another possibility would be that the continuation of large plantation agriculture was because of its relative
48:2500:112213:14:11:82:529:174:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:economic efficiency. Yet this seems inconsistent with the available evidence. For example, Wright (1986, p.
48:2501:112320:11:11:82:528:163:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:84) argues “The plantations survived the Civil War, and their survival had little to do with their efficiency as
48:2502:112432:11:11:82:529:152:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:producing units ... cotton and tobacco could be grown just as efficiently on family-sized farms. No, the key to
48:2503:112543:11:11:82:528:141:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the survival of the plantation was the ability of the former slave owners to hold on to their land in the midst of
48:2504:112657:11:11:82:528:130:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:intense legal and political struggles after 1865. In national politics, the planters successfully blocked proposals
48:2505:112772:11:7:82:314:119:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:for land confiscation and redistribution to the freedmen.”
48:2506:112830:7:15:91:529:112:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:40Death during the Civil War appears to have had little impact on the persistence of the planter elites because
48:2507:112941:15:0:82:493:97:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the law exempted one slaveholder from military service for every 20 slaves held (Wiener, 1978, p. 18).
49:2508:113045:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1 reproduces these data from Wiener (1978) and shows the high degree of persistence in the
49:2509:113135:18:18:82:252:682:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:identity of Southern landed elites.41
49:2510:113172:18:19:99:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:After the end of the Civil War, more or less the same group of planter elites controlled the
49:2511:113264:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:land and used various instruments to re-exert their control over the labor force. Though the
49:2512:113356:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specific economic institution of slavery did not persist, the evidence shows a clear line of per-
49:2513:113453:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sistence in the economic system of the South based on plantation-type agriculture with cheap
49:2514:113545:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:labor. This economic system was maintained through a variety of channels, including both
49:2515:113633:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:control of local politics and exercise of potentially violent de facto power. As a consequence,
49:2516:113728:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the words of W.E.B. Du Bois (1903, p. 88), the South became “simply an armed camp for
49:2517:113816:18:19:82:198:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:intimidatingblack folk.”
49:2518:113840:19:18:99:529:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The planter elite successfully staffed or co-opted the members of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
49:2519:113928:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:whose remit was to supervise the freed slaves. In 1865 the state legislature of Alabama passed
49:2520:114022:19:18:82:528:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the Black Code, an important landmark towards the repression of black labor. Wiener (1978,
49:2521:114112:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:p. 58) describes this as: “The Black Code of Alabama included two key laws intended to assure
49:2522:114205:18:19:82:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the planters a reliable supply of labor–a vagrancy law, and a law against the ‘enticement’ of
49:2523:114298:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:laborers”. These laws were designed to impede labor mobility and reduce competition in the
49:2524:114388:18:19:82:156:406:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:labor market.42
49:2525:114403:19:18:99:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to moulding the legal system in their favor, “Planters used Klan terror to keep
49:2526:114494:18:19:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:blacks from leaving the plantation regions, to get them to work, and keep them at work, in the
49:2527:114588:19:18:82:529:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cottonfield” (Wiener, 1978, p. 62).43In his seminal study of the politics of the South after
49:2528:114680:18:18:82:528:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:World War II, Key (1949, p. 9) sums up the pattern of persistence of the institutions of the
49:2529:114772:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:South both before and after the Civil War as the“extraordinary achievement of a relatively
49:2530:114862:19:18:82:409:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:small minority–the whites of the areas of heavy Negro population.”
49:2531:114928:18:19:99:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:A key to the persistence of the antebellum system after the Civil War was the continued
49:2532:115015:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:control over land. For example, in the debate over the redistribution of 40 acres of land to the
49:2533:115111:18:19:82:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:freedmen (vetoed by President Andrew Johnson in 1865), Congressman George Washington
49:2534:115195:19:16:82:300:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Julian argued (quoted in Wiener, 1978, p. 6):
49:2535:115240:16:15:91:528:205:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:41Other studiesfind similar persistence in other parts of the South. See, for example, Ransom and Sutch
49:2536:115343:15:11:82:529:190:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:(2001, pp. 78-80) on landonwership in Dallas County Alabama, Huffman (1974) on Clarke County, Georgia,
49:2537:115445:11:11:82:528:179:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:and Billings (1979) on North Carolina. This research to some extent contradicted earlier studies which had seen
49:2538:115556:11:7:82:458:168:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:far more change in the identity of Southern elites after the Civil War (e.g., Woodward, 1951)
49:2539:115649:7:15:91:529:161:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:42The extent to which southern planters were able to exert classical monopsony power is controversial, see
49:2540:115755:15:11:82:529:146:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Alston and Kauffman (2001). Nevertheless, economic historians do agree on the use of coercion, intimidation,
49:2541:115863:11:7:82:393:135:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:violence and segregationist legislation to repress and control free black labor.
49:2542:115943:7:15:91:528:128:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:43Relatedly, Alston and Ferrie (1989) show how planters controlled their labor force by offering them “security”
49:2543:116055:15:0:82:193:113:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:from violence and lynching.

50:2545:116169:18:30:110:344:682:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:agricultural basis of aristocratic power shall remain?”
50:2546:116224:30:19:99:528:652:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:A third strategy, again consistent with the emphasis on the de facto political power of the
50:2547:116315:19:18:82:528:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite in our theoretical analysis, was control of the local political system. Following the Civil
50:2548:116412:18:19:82:528:615:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:War, the period called ‘Reconstruction’ lasted until 1877 (see Stampp, 1965, and Foner, 1989).
50:2549:116506:19:18:82:528:596:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In this period Republican politicians contested power in the South and, with the help of the
50:2550:116598:18:18:82:528:578:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Union Army, engineered some social changes. Nevertheless, this induced a systematic backlash
50:2551:116690:18:19:82:529:560:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the guise of support for the Democratic Partyand the so-called ‘Redeemers.’ In 1877, in the
50:2552:116784:19:18:82:528:541:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:context of a log-roll between President Rutherford Hayes and Southern national politicians,
50:2553:116875:18:19:82:528:523:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Union soldiers were withdrawn from the South and the region left to its own devices. The period
50:2554:116970:19:18:82:528:504:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:after 1877 then marked the real recrudescence of the antebellum elite. The ‘redemption’ of the
50:2555:117064:18:19:82:529:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:South involved the systematic disenfranchisement of the black (and poor white) population
50:2556:117153:19:18:82:528:467:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:through the use of poll taxes and literacy tests (Key, 1949, Kousser, 1974) and the creation of
50:2557:117248:18:18:82:252:449:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:the one-party Democratic regime.44

50:2559:117371:19:18:82:529:412:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:noted the hegemony of southern society’s “upperbrackets” and the political marginalization
50:2560:117461:18:19:82:529:394:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of its “lower brackets.” He discusses in detailthe control of North Carolina’s economic oli-
50:2561:117553:19:18:82:529:375:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:garchy over politics, noting that (p. 211): “The effectiveness of the oligarchy’s control has
50:2562:117646:18:19:82:529:357:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:been achieved through the elevation to office of persons fundamentally in harmony with its
50:2563:117736:19:18:82:137:338:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:viewpoint.”
50:2564:117747:18:18:99:529:320:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This picture is also confirmed by the analysis of Wright (1986, p. 78), who writes “Even
50:2565:117835:18:19:82:528:302:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the 1930s, southern representatives in Washington did not use their powerful positions to
50:2566:117927:19:18:82:528:283:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:push for new federal projects, hospitals, public works and so on. They didn’t, that is, as long
50:2567:118022:18:19:82:388:265:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as the foundations of the low-wage regional economy persisted.”
50:2568:118085:19:18:99:529:246:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to disenfranchisement a whole gamut of segregationist legislation–the so-called

50:2570:118267:19:18:82:529:209:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:postbellum South into an effective “apartheid” society where blacks and whites lived different
50:2571:118361:18:18:82:529:191:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lives. As in South Africa, these laws were aimedat controlling the black population and its
50:2572:118452:18:16:82:144:173:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:labor supply.

50:2574:118569:15:11:82:528:142:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:black-belt whites. It would have meant in the ’nineties an appeal to the Negro vote and it would have meant
50:2575:118676:11:11:82:528:131:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:... Negro rule in some black-belt counties. From another standpoint, two-party competition would have meant

51:2599:120749:19:18:82:528:310:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of this Southern equilibrium, that the South started its process of rapid convergence to the

51:2603:121022:18:19:82:529:237:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of factors.  Initially, the depth of the GreatDepression weakened the resolve of Southern
51:2604:121111:19:18:82:529:218:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:politicians to block federal policies that might integrate the Southern economy into the rest

51:2607:121385:18:18:82:529:163:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:agriculture. As blacks became harder to trap in the South, they also became less necessary to

51:2610:121603:15:7:82:305:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the poor incentives created by sharecropping contracts.
51:2611:121658:7:15:91:529:107:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:46An interesting question, which is not central to our interpretation, is whether mechanization of cotton
51:2612:121763:15:0:82:528:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:reduced the cost of black migration to the Southern landed elite, who then tolerated such outmigration, or

52:2615:122051:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the concurrent rapid spread of mechanized cotton picking. First introduced in 1949, by the end
52:2616:122145:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the 1950s mechanical cotton picking was the rule rather than the exception in the South;

52:2619:122401:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the Civil Rights movement and a sequence of Supreme Court and government decisions, such
52:2620:122492:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as Brown versus Board of Education in 1954, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights

52:2630:123377:25:19:82:529:370:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Despite the significant changes in political institutionsthat have taken place since the colonial
52:2631:123474:19:18:82:529:351:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:era in Latin America, the capture of political and economic institutions by elites is an enduring
52:2632:123571:18:19:82:528:333:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:theme of much of the historical literature onthe sub-continent. There are numerous studies
52:2633:123661:19:18:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:documenting both the capture of democratic politics by traditional elites and the resulting
52:2634:123752:18:19:82:528:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:continuation of labor repressive policies in agriculture in many Central and Latin American
52:2635:123843:19:18:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:countries. Some notable examples include Zeitlin (1984) and Zeitlin and Ratcliff(1988) on
52:2636:123932:18:18:82:528:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Chile, Smith (1979) on Mexico, and Paige (1997) on Central America. A central question for

52:2638:124111:19:18:82:528:222:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the Caribbean is therefore how and why the economic system based on labor repression and
52:2639:124199:18:19:82:529:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cheap labor in agriculture failed to change following the political reforms that have gradually
52:2640:124294:19:18:82:462:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:brought more democratic means of collective decision-making in these societies.
52:2641:124373:18:19:99:529:167:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:As in the U. S. South, the answer is related to the exercise of de facto political power
52:2642:124461:19:18:82:528:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by traditional elites in the context of democratic politics. The capture of democratic politics
52:2643:124556:18:18:82:528:130:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in Colombia, for example, took many different forms, depending on the specific conditions
52:2644:124645:18:20:82:528:112:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the options open to the traditional elites, with the most common forms being the actual
52:2645:124736:20:0:82:514:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:whether the changes in the supply of cheap labor causedby black outmigration encouraged mechanization.

53:2647:124937:18:18:82:175:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and use of violence.
53:2648:124957:18:19:99:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The most obvious form of political capture is the actual running of political parties and
53:2649:125046:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:offices by members of the landed elite. This has been particularly the case in much of Central
53:2650:125140:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:America and has been carefully documented byStone (1975, 1990). His genealogical research

53:2656:125632:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:century.  Figure 1 shows that no less that 48 presidents were direct descendents of Alfaro,
53:2657:125723:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:25 of them in Costa Rica. Alfaro’s descendents also include the Somoza dynasty who ruled
53:2658:125811:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Nicaragua for most of the 20th century until theSandinista Revolution in 1979. Figure 2 shows
53:2659:125904:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the 29 presidents descended from Vázquez, including again the Somoza clan and many of the
53:2660:125993:18:19:82:312:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:same presidents of Costa Rica related to Alfaro.
53:2661:126041:19:18:99:529:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:As a case study we now examine Colombia in more detail. Colombia became independent
53:2662:126124:18:19:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from Spain in 1819 and the Liberal and Conservative partiesfirst competed in the election
53:2663:126213:19:18:82:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of 1850.47These two parties have maintained their hold on political power ever since. As
53:2664:126301:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:early as 1856 the Liberals introduced universal male suffrage and as many as 40% of adult
53:2665:126390:19:18:82:529:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:males voted (Bushnell, 1971). After the 1863 Constitution, voting rights were determined at
53:2666:126481:18:18:82:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the state level, but several of them maintained universal suffrage (see Delpar, 1981). In the
53:2667:126574:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:19th century, the parties contested elections, but they also fought for power. Although the
53:2668:126665:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:fighting sometimes took the form of civil wars, the parties also frequently reached collusive
53:2669:126758:18:19:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:agreements to make sure that other political parties, especially those representing peasants
53:2670:126850:19:18:82:529:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and workers, were unable to enter the politicalsystem. For example, after the civil war from
53:2671:126942:18:19:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1899 to 1902, the two parties introduced a power-sharing agreement, which divided all the
53:2672:127031:19:18:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:seats in the legislature between the two parties by means of the ‘incomplete vote’ (Mazzuca
53:2673:127122:18:18:82:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and Robinson, 2004). This system lasted until 1929. After a civil war in the 1950s (a period
53:2674:127214:18:19:82:529:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:know asLa Violencia), the parties resurrected this collusive agreement in 1958, splitting the
53:2675:127307:19:18:82:529:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:legislature 50-50 and also agreeing to take turns at the presidency for 16 years. In practice
53:2676:127400:18:16:82:408:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:this power sharing agreement endured until the middle of the 1980s.
53:2677:127467:16:15:91:529:132:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:47The best studies of the origins of the parties are Colmenares (1968), Safford (1972) and Delpar (1981).
53:2678:127572:15:11:82:529:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Some trace the alignments to factions that formed in the late 1820s over whether or not Simón Bolívar should
53:2679:127680:11:0:82:529:106:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:be made Emperor, though there have also typically been significant policy differences between these two parties.
54:2680:127794:0:18:99:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The Liberals and Conservatives managed to successfully block entry of other parties to
54:2681:127880:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the political system through a variety of strategies. Even after the reintroduction of universal
54:2682:127976:18:19:82:529:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:suffrage in 1936, fraud, violence, and engineering the electoral rules to create barriers to entry
54:2683:128074:19:18:82:529:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:were widespread.48Electoral fraud is, in fact, a recurrent theme in Colombian politics and took
54:2684:128169:18:19:82:529:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:many forms (see, for example, Bushnell, 1993, and Chaves, Fergusson and Robinson, 2005).

54:2686:128351:18:19:82:443:590:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:during the attempt by Rojas Pinilla to win the 1970 presidential election.49

54:2689:128605:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:murdered in 1948 just when it seemed likely he would become the leader of the Liberal party.
54:2690:128697:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Luis Carlos Galán was murdered in 1990 just as he was emerging as the leader of the Liberal
54:2691:128788:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:party.50In the 1980s thefirst alternative political party to seriously emerge since the beginning
54:2692:128885:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the National Front in 1958 was the Unión Patriótica. This party was effectively obliterated
54:2693:128979:18:18:82:508:461:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:in the 1980s by the systematic murder of its candidates (see, for example, Kline, 1999).51
54:2694:129069:18:19:99:529:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, as in Central America, the political parties in Colombia have featured strong
54:2695:129155:19:18:82:529:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:family ties. The Conservative Ospina family has provided three Presidents, Mariano Ospina
54:2696:129244:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Rodríguez (1857-1861), Pedro Nel Ospina (1922-1926) and Mariano Ospina Pérez (1946-1950).
54:2697:129333:19:18:82:528:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The Liberal López family provided not just Alfonso between 1934 and 1938, and again between
54:2698:129424:18:16:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1942 and 1945, but also Alfonso López Michelsen between 1974 and 1978. The Liberal Lleras
54:2699:129513:16:15:91:529:353:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:48This is related to the absence of a socialist party in Colombia.  Some scholars have suggested that the
54:2700:129618:15:11:82:529:338:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:relatively egalitarian frontier expansion that took place in the second half of the 19th century has contributed
54:2701:129730:11:11:82:528:327:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to the creation of a middle class of property owners, which checked radicalism in Colombian politics.  This
54:2702:129837:11:11:82:528:316:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:thesis does not appear to be very convincing in view of the fact that Colombia has one of the most unequal
54:2703:129943:11:7:82:515:305:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:distributions of land ownership and income in the world (on this Antioqueño expansion see Christie, 1978).
54:2704:130049:7:15:91:529:298:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:49Another factor that appears to have contributed to the continuation of the two-party system is the way
54:2705:130153:15:11:82:528:283:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the electoral system created incentives for dissidentsto stay within the traditional parties. For example, the
54:2706:130263:11:11:82:528:272:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:electoral system ensured that candidates could be elected with far fewer votes than the electoral quotient, thus
54:2707:130375:11:11:82:529:261:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:potentially guaranteeing that elite factions would get representation. At the same time, the traditional parties
54:2708:130487:11:10:82:528:250:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:allowed “dissident lists” to run, providing a platform to potential dissidents. In line with these ideas, Dix (1967,
54:2709:130603:10:11:82:528:240:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:p. 250) notes “proportional representation may have helped to a degree to reinforce the two-party system by
54:2710:130710:11:11:82:528:229:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:allowing dissident factions to gain representation according to their strength in the electorate while still not
54:2711:130822:11:11:82:529:218:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:forcing them from the party. Retaining the party label, or some version of it, they have usually been reabsorbed
54:2712:130934:11:8:82:289:207:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:into the officialist ranks after one or two elections.”
54:2713:130989:8:14:91:529:199:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:50Political entrepreneurs, like Gaitán and subsequently Alfonso López Michelsen and Galán, considered form-
54:2714:131096:14:11:82:528:185:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:ing a third party, but then always returned to the fold because the electoral system made success by third
54:2715:131202:11:11:82:529:174:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:parties difficult. Indeed, it is quite likely that the assassination of Gaitán was precisely because he hadfinally
54:2716:131316:11:7:82:528:163:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:emerged as the leader of the Liberal party, not because political rivals anticipated the creation of a third party.
54:2717:131431:7:15:91:529:156:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:51In the 1986 elections, Unión Patriótica obtained 5 seats in the Senate and 9 in the Chamber of Representa-
54:2718:131539:15:11:82:529:141:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:tives at the national level, and 14 deputies, 351 councilmen and 23 municipal mayors at the local level. By 1988,
54:2719:131652:11:11:82:528:130:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the party was wiped out, however. The Amnesty International reported that more than 500 of its members,
54:2720:131755:11:11:82:529:119:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:including its previous presidential candidate, Pardo Leal, and 4 congressmen, had been assassinated, most likely
54:2721:131867:11:0:82:394:108:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:with the involvement of members of the Colombian military and government.

55:2723:132030:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in 1966-1970 (Carlos Lleras Restrepo).  The Conservative Pastrana family provided Misael

55:2726:132291:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the father of Liberal President Julio Turbay (1978-1982)
55:2727:132385:19:18:82:398:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:had previously been the most powerfulfigure in the Liberal party.
55:2728:132450:18:19:99:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, through a variety of means, including elite domination of politics, electoral fraud,

55:2730:132638:18:18:82:529:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to have a disproportionate effect in the democratic politics of Central America and Colombia.
55:2731:132731:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We conjecture that this pattern of elite dominance has been an important element in the
55:2732:132818:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:continuation of the economic system based on cheap labor and quasi-labor repression in the
55:2733:132908:18:29:82:269:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:countryside of many of these countries.

55:2736:133103:18:19:82:529:425:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with the example of Liberia. Modern Liberia was started in 1820 by the American Colonization
55:2737:133195:19:18:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Society (ACS) as a home for freed and repatriated African slaves.52The ACS bought land
55:2738:133281:18:19:82:528:388:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from local chiefs around the site of the modern capital of Monrovia (named after the then
55:2739:133370:19:18:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:President of the United States James Monroe), and in 1847 Liberia became independent of the
55:2740:133461:18:18:82:528:351:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ACS. The year 1877 saw the emergence of the True Whig Party (TWP), which would dominate
55:2741:133548:18:19:82:528:333:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:politics until the coup of Samuel Doe in 1980. The TWP comprised of the descendents of the
55:2742:133638:19:18:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:repatriated slaves, the Americo-Liberians, who dominated the party and the country for over a
55:2743:133731:18:19:82:528:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:century. This group set themselves up as an elite over the ‘tribal peoples’ and ran the country
55:2744:133826:19:18:82:514:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as if it were a colony. By the 1960s Americo-Liberians were about 3-5% of the population.
55:2745:133915:18:19:99:529:259:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Despite the early emergence of the Americo-Liberian elite in Liberia, the political system
55:2746:134005:19:18:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:has relied on elections since the 19th century, and became fully democratic starting in 1944.
55:2747:134098:18:18:82:528:222:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Nevertheless, like their Central American or Southern U.S. counterparts, the Americo-Liberian
55:2748:134191:18:19:82:529:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elite have been able to dominate democratic politics through a variety of means, including
55:2749:134281:19:18:82:528:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:extreme electoral fraud and violence, and theirdomination of politics has been a major cause

56:2755:134769:18:30:82:355:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by the elite of the TWP and Americo-Liberians and that

56:2758:135004:18:18:110:501:615:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:that the traditional Americo-Liberian rulers, who fear losing political control to the tribal

56:2763:135393:30:18:99:529:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The TWP used indirect rule adapted from theBritish to control the hinterland and ma-

56:2767:135762:19:18:82:528:437:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:characterizes their outlook: to retain power in traditional fashion and keep the natives in their

56:2774:136294:19:18:82:528:308:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:forced labor on public works and rubber plantations (1/4 of the labor force in early 1960s)
56:2775:136385:18:18:82:528:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the economy was either completely controlled by the TWP or by foreigners. The state

56:2777:136561:19:18:82:212:253:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the Americo-Liberians.
56:2778:136587:18:19:99:529:235:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:A key feature of Liberian politics, facilitating the exercise of power by the TWP, was the
56:2779:136677:19:18:82:528:216:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:kinship networks of the Americo-Liberians (see Fraenkel, 1964). Dalton (p. 589) argues that “to
56:2780:136772:18:19:82:529:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:understand Liberian politics, knowledge of kinship connections is more useful than knowledge

56:2784:137100:14:15:91:529:129:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:53Indeed Liberia has the sad reputation as having had the most corrupt election ever held for Charles B.

56:2786:137316:11:11:82:529:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:reported in world history. Suffrage was constitutionally limited to some 15,000 citizens, all Americo-Liberians,
56:2787:137428:11:0:82:462:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:but according to the official election results some 240,000 votes were cast for Charles B. King.
57:2788:137526:0:18:99:529:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:After his defeat in the 1927 presidential elections, Thomas Faulkner accused the President-
57:2789:137617:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:elect, Charles D.B. King, of allowing slavery to exist in the Republic and that certain highly
57:2790:137711:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:placed government officials were engaged in the forced shipping of laborers to the Spanish
57:2791:137801:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:island of Fernando Po. Faulkner’s accusations spurred a wave of international reactions, and a
57:2792:137895:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Committee of the League of Nations, established to examine the allegations, indeed concluded
57:2793:137987:19:18:82:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that shipment of laborers to Fernando Po and Gabon was associated with slavery because the
57:2794:138077:18:19:82:529:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:method of recruiting carried compulsion with it. Moreover, persons holding official positions
57:2795:138170:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:were shown to have illegally misused their office in recruiting labor with the aid of the Liberian
57:2796:138268:18:18:82:529:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Frontier Force (the national military controlled by the TWP). Not only had Americo-Liberian
57:2797:138359:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:government officials benefited from forced labour, but so had the most major foreign company
57:2798:138451:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in Liberia, Firestone.54In essence the TWP had offered Harvey Firestone a guaranteed cheap
57:2799:138541:18:19:82:228:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:labor supply through coercion.
57:2800:138571:19:18:99:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:There can be few better historical examples of an elite than the Americo-Liberians and
57:2801:138657:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the TWP. Initially, they were able to restrict de jure power only to themselves, completely
57:2802:138748:18:19:82:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:disenfranchising the indigenous Africans. They were also able to dominate in their use of de
57:2803:138840:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:facto power because they had the support of the United States and superior weapons. Over
57:2804:138928:18:19:82:529:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:time the political system opened. After 1944 the TWP had to deal with the political inclusion
57:2805:139021:19:18:82:528:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of peoples in the hinterland. They were nonetheless able to use their de facto power to maintain
57:2806:139117:18:19:82:268:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the economic institutions they favored.
57:2807:139156:19:18:99:529:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Therefore, the domination of politics by theAmerico-Liberian elite and their choices of
57:2808:139243:18:18:82:529:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(highly inefficient) economic institutions to redistribute resources to themselves gives another
57:2809:139339:18:19:82:529:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:example of the successful exercise of de facto power by an elite both under nondemocratic and
57:2810:139432:19:34:82:237:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democratic political institutions.
57:2811:139466:34:29:82:206:261:209:g_d0_f4:209:g_d0_f4:C:8Conclusions
57:2812:139478:29:19:82:529:232:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Almost all theoretical and empirical research in political economy starts with the presumption
57:2813:139572:19:18:82:529:213:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that institutions, once in place, persist and shape the political-economic interactions of different
57:2814:139672:18:19:82:528:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:groups and agents. Nevertheless, many societies experience frequent changes in their political
57:2815:139766:19:18:82:528:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions, such as the end of the colonial era and the creation of the republics throughout
57:2816:139860:18:16:82:528:158:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the 19th and 20th centuries, or multiple switches between dictatorship and democracy during
57:2817:139951:16:15:91:529:142:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:54Vast rubber plantations were started by Firestone in 1926. Firestone obtained a one million acre concession
57:2818:140060:15:11:82:529:127:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:for a 99-year period (roughly corresponding to 10% of what was considered arable land in Liberia), was granted
57:2819:140170:11:11:82:528:116:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:the exclusive rights upon the lands selected, and became–with small, exceptions–exempted of all present and
57:2820:140277:11:0:82:133:105:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:future taxes.
58:2821:140292:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the 20th century. Certain economic institutions also change, with slavery, forced labor, and the
58:2822:140388:18:18:82:528:682:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:encomiendacoming to an end in Latin America and Caribbean, and waves of nationalization
58:2823:140475:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and privatization of industry in many less developed countries. In the face of this picture of
58:2824:140569:19:18:82:499:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:frequently changing (political and economic) institutions, do institutions really persist?
58:2825:140659:18:19:99:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:This paper has argued that the answer is yes, in the sense that the broad economic in-
58:2826:140745:19:18:82:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stitutions, which are essential for economic outcomes, can persist even when specific political
58:2827:140840:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:institutions, or even specific economic institutions, change. In line with this perspective, it has
58:2828:140939:19:18:82:487:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:proposed a simple model of the coexistence of change and persistence in institutions.
58:2829:141024:18:18:99:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The basic idea is that economic institutions are decided by groups or individuals that pos-
58:2830:141115:18:19:82:528:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sess more political power. Political power, in turn, consists of de jure power regulated by formal
58:2831:141213:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:political institutions and de facto political power, which comes from the ability of various dif-
58:2832:141310:18:19:82:529:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ferent social groups to solve their collective action problems, lobby or bribe politicians, capture
58:2833:141409:19:18:82:528:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and control political parties, or use paramilitaries or other means of repression. Changes in
58:2834:141502:18:18:82:528:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specific political institutions, for example a change from nondemocracy to democracy, affects
58:2835:141595:18:19:82:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the distribution of de jure political power. This, however, may induce cohesive (and small)
58:2836:141686:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:groups, such as (landed) elites to increase their investments in de facto political power to offset
58:2837:141785:18:19:82:251:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their loss of de jure political power.
58:2838:141823:19:18:99:529:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate this mechanism in its starkest form, our baseline model assumed that the
58:2839:141909:18:19:82:528:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:technology of generating de facto political power for the elite is the same in democracy and
58:2840:142001:19:18:82:528:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:nondemocracy, and demonstrated the possibility of invariance, that is, a pattern where the
58:2841:142091:18:18:82:528:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium distribution of economic institutions is independent of whether the society is de-
58:2842:142185:18:19:82:528:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:mocratic or not–despite the fact that democracy creates a real shift in the distribution of de
58:2843:142279:19:18:82:528:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:jure power towards the citizens. The reason for this stark result is that the landed elite invest
58:2844:142376:18:19:82:529:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:enough to fully offset their loss of de jure power when society switches from nondemocracy to
58:2845:142469:19:18:82:135:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:democracy.
58:2846:142479:18:19:99:529:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The result that investment in the de facto power by the elite entirely offsets changes in
58:2847:142568:19:18:82:528:221:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:de jure power is special, and the analysis showed how, more generally, the equilibrium takes
58:2848:142660:18:18:82:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the form of a Markov regime-switching process with state dependence. This Markov regime-
58:2849:142748:18:19:82:528:185:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:switching structure emerges when some of the assumptions of the baseline model are relaxed,
58:2850:142839:19:18:82:529:166:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for example, when democracy is allowed to place limits on the exercise of de facto power by
58:2851:142930:18:19:82:528:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the elite (e.g., on their capture of political parties or use of paramilitaries), or when there are
58:2852:143029:19:18:82:351:129:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:costs of changing economic institutions in the short run.
58:2853:143086:18:19:99:528:111:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The richest model is presented in Section 5, and allows for the feature that political insti-
58:2854:143179:19:0:82:528:92:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tutions are more difficult to change than are economic institutions. Under this assumption,
59:2855:143272:0:18:82:528:700:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a pattern of “captured democracy” arises, whereby democracy endures, but the elite are able
59:2856:143363:18:18:82:529:682:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to have a disproportionate effect on equilibrium economic institutions. In fact, in this model,
59:2857:143458:18:19:82:528:664:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:paradoxically, the probability of labor repressive economic institutions in agriculture may be
59:2858:143552:19:18:82:528:645:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:higher in democracy than in nondemocracy. Thismodel is useful for interpreting the historical
59:2859:143645:18:19:82:528:627:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:patterns discussed in Section 7. These patterns show the coexistence of change and persis-
59:2860:143735:19:18:82:529:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tence in institutions in the U.S. South, Latin America and Africa, and how traditional elites
59:2861:143828:18:19:82:528:590:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:may be able to control democratic politics and maintain their favorite economic institutions.
59:2862:143921:19:18:82:528:571:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In all the cases we discussed, changes in some important dimensions of political institutions,
59:2863:144015:18:18:82:528:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which may have been potentially quite costly for the elites, were neutralized by the exercise of
59:2864:144111:18:19:82:529:535:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their de facto power, for example, control of the party system or key offices, or local violence.
59:2865:144208:19:18:82:528:516:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:These examples suggest that the mechanisms highlighted by our model may be important in
59:2866:144295:18:19:82:528:498:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:understanding how frequent changes in specific political institutions go hand-in-hand with the
59:2867:144389:19:18:82:529:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:persistence of economic systems, with their broad distributional and efficiency characteristics
59:2868:144484:18:18:82:136:461:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:unchanged.
59:2869:144494:18:19:99:528:443:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The mechanism proposed in this paper, where the identity of the elites as well as the
59:2870:144579:19:18:82:528:424:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economic systems persist, is only one facet of institutional persistence. Another pattern, which
59:2871:144675:18:19:82:528:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:appears salient in practice, for example, in cases such as Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ghana,
59:2872:144769:19:18:82:528:387:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is one in which the identity of the elites changes, but new elites adopt policies in line with
59:2873:144863:18:19:82:529:369:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:B:the worst practices of their predecessors. This is reminiscent of Michels’ (1911)Iron Law of
59:2874:144955:19:18:82:528:350:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:Oligarchy, as well as of the emphasis by sociologists such as Mills (1956), Mosca (1939) and
59:2875:145047:18:18:82:528:332:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Pareto (1968) on the persistence and creation of elites. This pattern seems like a challenging
59:2876:145141:18:19:82:529:314:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:but important area of study. Most ambitiously, future research may strive towards a unified
59:2877:145232:19:18:82:529:295:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model that can explain the composition of elites, when existing elites persist, when elites change
59:2878:145330:18:19:82:528:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:but institutions persist, and when institutions truly change. Alternatively, a model isolating
59:2879:145424:19:18:82:528:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the iron law of oligarchy may be useful in understanding why dysfunctional incentives persist in
59:2880:145520:18:0:82:528:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the political arena, a direction we are currently pursuing in Acemoglu and Robinson (2006b).

60:2929:146031:17:17:99:529:501:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:The proof proceeds in several steps. First, Assumption 3 implies thatθi(N)=0andθi(D)=0for

61:3146:148630:17:27:82:254:248:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:so the solution to this problem involves

62:3304:151346:15:15:91:529:129:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:55Clearly, there may exist other punishment strategies, potentially supporting a larger set of SPEs for any
62:3305:151453:15:11:82:529:114:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:given discount factor, for example by using minmax punishments for sufficiently high discount factors (e.g.,
62:3306:151561:11:11:82:528:103:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Abreu, 1988). Nevertheless, for our purposes, it is sufficient to characterize the Pareto optimal SPEs with the
62:3307:151672:11:0:82:474:92:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:MPE punishment, since asβ→1, these will coincide with the entire set of Pareto optimal SPEs.
