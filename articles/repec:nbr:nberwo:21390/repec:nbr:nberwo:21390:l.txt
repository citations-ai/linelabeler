2:30:1494:10:13:72:74:606:8:g_d0_f1:8:g_d0_f1:F: 
2:31:1494:13:14:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We use experimental data of a training program in 2005 in Colombia. We find that even up to ten
2:32:1589:14:14:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:years ahead, the JeA program had a positive and significant effect on the probability to work in the
2:33:1689:14:14:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:formal sector. Applicants in the treatment group also contributed more months to social security during
2:34:1792:14:14:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the analyzed period, and to work for a large firm. Earnings of treated applicants were 11.8% higher
2:35:1891:14:14:72:540:537:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in the whole sample, and they made larger contributions to social security. In addition, we also present
2:36:1995:14:14:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:non parametric bounds that for some percentiles of the sample of women, there are positive and nearly
2:37:2096:14:14:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:significant effects of the program. Thus, the effects of the program would have been capitalized both
2:38:2197:14:14:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in increases in the likelihood of being formal, and increases in productivity. We also present evidence
2:39:2300:14:14:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that the estimated program effects on the likelihood of working for the formal sector, the likelihood
2:40:2401:14:14:72:540:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of working for a large firm, and the earnings in the formal sector, are not an artifact of analyzing multiple
2:41:2510:14:28:72:121:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:outcomes.
2:42:2519:28:14:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We also find that for the whole sample of applicants, those in the treatment group have 0.315 more
2:43:2617:14:14:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:years of education, and have a probability of graduating from high school 10 percent higher than the
2:44:2717:14:14:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:control group. We find no significant effect on the probability of attending college or any school program,
2:45:2824:14:14:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:nor on fertility decisions, marital status or some dimensions of assortative mating. Among applicants
2:46:2925:14:14:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:matching to the census of the poorest population, we find that beneficiaries are more likely to participate
2:47:3032:14:14:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in the labor market, to be employed, and to be enrolled in a private health insurance at the time of
2:48:3132:14:28:72:125:341:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the survey.
2:49:3143:28:14:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Finally, we find that the benefits of the JeA program are higher than it costs, leading to an internal
2:50:3245:14:14:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:rate of return of at least 22.1 percent. On the whole, the program was a cost-effective alternative, worth
2:51:3351:14:42:72:529:285:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:to consider to bridging the transit of youths from the informal to the formal sector in the future.

3:80:3957:0:27:71:175:717:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:I. Introduction 
3:81:3972:27:28:71:74:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: 
3:82:3972:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Developing  skills  and  participating  in  the  formal  labor  market  is  a  central  policy  concern  in 
3:83:4080:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:developing  countries.  The  issue  acquires  particular  importance  once  we  recognize  that  a  well- 
3:84:4186:28:28:71:545:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:functioning  economy,  which  can  attract  investment  and  promote  growth,   requires  individuals 
3:85:4288:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with  sufficient  levels  of skills and  work  readiness  (see,  for  instance,  OECD  2012).  Moreover, 
3:86:4393:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unskilled  youth  have  particularly  low  labor  market attachment  and  are  vulnerable  to  poverty. 
3:87:4496:28:27:71:542:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:According to Székely (2011), 20% of Colombian youths 15-18 years old were not in education, 
3:88:4588:27:28:71:542:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment,  or  training  by  2005,  while  Guarín  and  Medina  (2015)  show  that  in  Colombian 
3:89:4688:28:28:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cities  like  Medellín, the  same  figure  is  as  high  as 44% for youth  16-20  years  old. With  these 
3:90:4794:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:central issues in mind, on the wake of the worst recession after WWII Colombia experienced in 
3:91:4888:27:28:71:543:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1999-2000, the Colombian Government implemented an important youth training program called 
3:92:4979:28:27:71:543:386:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f2:B:Jovenes en Acción (JeA).1 The program, which was operated between 2001 and 2005, combined 
3:93:5069:27:28:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:classroom  training  with  an  internship  and  was  offered  to  individuals  who  were  pre-screened  by 
3:94:5176:28:28:71:543:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:private-sector training  institutions,  of  which  some  were  for-profit  and  some were  not.  These 
3:95:5279:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:institutions  designed  the content  of  the courses  and  were  responsible  to  find firms  operating  in 
3:96:5387:27:28:71:542:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  formal  labor  market  that  would  accept  the  youths  for  the  required  internships;  this 
3:97:5488:28:27:71:543:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mechanism  provided  clear  incentives,  as  payments  were  linked  to  the  completion  of  both the 
3:98:5591:27:28:71:277:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:class room and the internship component.

3:100:5633:28:27:71:542:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:To evaluate the program, a randomized trial was carried out and analyzed by Attanasio, Kugler 
3:101:5727:27:27:71:542:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and  Meghir  (2011)  (AKM  henceforth).  They  found  that  the  program  benefited  mainly  women, 
3:102:5827:27:8:215:218:111:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:

3:104:5998:16:0:71:457:87:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:(2007), and Fedesarrollo (2009, 2010), among others for issues relating to training in Colombia. 
4:105:6139:0:27:71:542:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increasing  their  employment,  their  participation  in  the  formal  sector  and  their  earnings.  Under 
4:106:6247:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  most  conservative  scenario  the  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  program  for  women  was 
4:107:6349:28:27:71:543:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:calculated to be 21.6%. For men however, there was no discernible effect other than a shift to the 
4:108:6448:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:formal  sector.  This  in  itself  is  important  however,  because  the  formal  sector  offers  numerous 
4:109:6555:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:benefits  and  because  firms  that  operate  in  the  formal  sector  tend  to  be  higher  productivity  (see 
4:110:6667:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Meghir, Narita and Robin, 2015), which might lead possibly to further training and professional

4:116:7084:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:share  of  labor  force  self-employed  is  about  twice  as  large.  According  to  Medina  et  al. (2013), 
4:117:7193:28:27:71:543:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Cárdenas  and  Mejía  (2007), and  López  (2010), since  the  mid  1980s  informality (based  on  the 
4:118:7295:27:28:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ILO definition) has fluctuated in Colombia from 53%  to 60% and is particularly high among the 
4:119:7390:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:young (see Saavedra and Medina, 2013), at a time which is important for laying the foundations 
4:120:7485:28:27:71:182:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of a productive career. 
4:121:7509:27:28:71:74:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: 
4:122:7509:28:27:71:543:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Ten  years  have  passed  since  the JeA experiment  and  the  program  itself  ended.  An  important 
4:123:7611:27:28:71:542:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:question, given the promising short run impacts found by AKM, is whether the program had any 
4:124:7704:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long-term  effects.  This  question  is  particularly  salient  given  the  effects  the  program  had  on 
4:125:7811:28:27:71:542:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participation  in  the  formal  labor  market:  given  the  importance  of  informality  in  Latin  America 
4:126:7919:27:28:71:543:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and in Colombia specifically, programs that can reduce informality in the long run are likely to 
4:127:8016:28:27:71:387:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:be very valuable from both a growth and a welfare point of view. 
4:128:8080:27:0:71:74:83:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: 
5:129:8125:0:27:71:542:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Although  there  are  other  experimental  studies  evaluating  job  training  programs  implemented  in 
5:130:8230:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Latin American countries, there is no one to our knowledge that had assessed their effect beyond 
5:131:8327:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a  three  years  horizon.2  We  are  in  the  extremely  fortunate  position  to  be  able  to  link  into  the 
5:132:8439:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:experimental sample administrative information on whether workers are employed in the formal 
5:133:8532:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sector and if so what their earnings are. This allows us to evaluate whether the program achieved 
5:134:8630:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one of its longer-term aims, namely to increase attachment to the formal sector.  Moreover, the 
5:135:8726:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:earnings  data,  albeit  censored,  allows  us  to  estimate  bounds  on  the  treatment  effects  on 
5:136:8828:28:27:71:543:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:underlying  productivity. Finally,  additional  administrative  data  allow  us  to  look  at  a  variety  of 
5:137:8938:27:28:71:174:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:additional outcomes. 
5:138:8959:28:28:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, in this paper, we merge the experimental data of the Colombia’s JeA evaluation collected 
5:139:9053:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in  2005 with social  and  labor  market  administrative  records  collected  between  July  2008  and 
5:140:9156:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:June 2014, which we describe in detail below. We then use the resulting data to assess its impact 
5:141:9254:28:27:71:199:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on a variety of outcomes.  
5:142:9281:27:28:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We find that the JeA program had a positive and significant effect on the probability to work in 
5:143:9377:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the formal sector, and those applicants in the treatment group contributed more months to social 
5:144:9474:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:security  during  the  analyzed  period.  Beneficiaries  of  the JeA program  were  also  more  likely  to 
5:145:9580:27:28:71:543:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:work  for  a  large  firm. Formal  earnings  of  treated  applicants  were  11.8  percent higher  in  the 
5:146:9686:28:27:71:542:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whole  sample,  and  they  made  larger  contributions  to  social  security.  We  also  find  that  for  the 
5:147:9796:27:28:71:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whole sample of applicants, those in the treatment group have 0.24 more years of education.  The 
5:148:9893:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:long  run  effects  of  the  program  are  stronger  for  women  than  for  men,  consistently  with  the 
5:149:9999:28:43:71:542:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evidence  in  AKM  about  the  short  run  impacts.  For  women  we  also  find  some  suggestive

6:154:10468:0:27:71:542:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evidence  that  the  program  improved  their  productivity  (in  addition  to  improve  their  chances  of 
6:155:10576:27:28:71:218:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:working in the formal sector).

6:158:10721:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:background of the JeA program. In Section 3, we describe the data used in the paper and provide 
6:159:10816:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:some  descriptive  statistics  of  it.  In  Section  4,  we present the  estimated  effects  of  the  program 
6:160:10926:27:28:71:381:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and, in Section 5, its cost-benefit analysis. Section 6 concludes.

6:165:11114:27:28:71:543:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f3:B:implemented  in  the  early  2000s  in  Colombia  as  part  of  a  wider  strategy  called Red  de  Apoyo 
6:166:11220:28:27:71:543:386:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f2:B:Social,  aimed  at  providing  a  safety  net  for  the  poorest sectors  of  the population  after  the  crisis 
6:167:11333:27:28:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that hit the country in the late 1990s.3 It was initially funded with a USD$70 million loan from 
6:168:11430:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  Inter-American  Development  Bank,  and  was  targeted  to  unemployed  youths  18  to  25,  who 
6:169:11532:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:belonged to the poorest population classified in the two lowest levels of a score, called SISBEN, 
6:170:11630:27:28:71:543:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which  is  used  in  Colombia  to  target  all  welfare  programs.4  As  DNP  (2000b)  highlights,

6:176:12220:11:12:71:542:168:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:simultaneously created with program Familias en Acción, by the CONPES policy document 3081 of June 28, 2000

6:181:12759:12:11:71:541:110:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:program,  individuals  were  additionally  required  to  have  a  valid  id,  and  if  the  applicant  a  mother  of  children  under 
6:182:12893:11:12:71:542:99:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:seven  years  of  age,  she  must  present  an  official  document  to  prove  her  maternity.  Applicants  that  had  previously 
6:183:13023:12:0:71:467:87:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:taken training courses at SENA or any training institution were also eligible to Jóvenes en Acción.

7:186:13388:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  seven  main  cities  of  the  country:  Bogotá,  Medellín,  Cali,  Barranquilla,  Bucaramanga, 
7:187:13488:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Manizales and Cartagena. According to FIP and DNP (2001), by 2001, the program planned to 
7:188:13578:28:28:71:543:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:enroll about  100,000  students  in  these  cities between  2001  and  2003.  According  to  AKM, 
7:189:13676:28:27:71:536:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:however, it actually began to enroll them in 2002, and, by 2005, it had enrolled 80,000 students.

7:194:14082:28:27:71:543:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:youths’  occupational  skills,  so to   increase  their  likelihood  to  become  employed  and  improve 
7:195:14186:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:their  performance  at  work,  (ii)  to  promote  the  private  supply  of  relevant  job  training  programs 
7:196:14296:28:27:71:530:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for poor youths, and (iii) to put productive poor youths and training institutions closer to firms.

7:198:14396:28:28:71:543:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f2:B:Jóvenes  en  Acción essentially  consisted  of  training  courses  designed  and  provided  by  private 
7:199:14499:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:institutions,  known  as  ECAP,  after  the  Spanish  acronym  for  training institutions.  Each  course 
7:200:14604:27:28:71:542:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:was  expected  to  train  about  30  unemployed youths selected amongst eligible applicants.  The 
7:201:14702:28:27:71:542:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:course  had  to have  three  main  components:  (i)  classroom  training;  (ii)  on-the-job  training;  and 
7:202:14810:27:28:71:542:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(iii) the youth’s project of life (FIP and DNP, 2001). The aim was to develop occupational skills, 
7:203:14908:28:0:71:543:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:social  skills  and  broader  career  objectives.  The  program  also  included  a  small  stipend  of about 
8:204:15062:0:27:71:542:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:USD$2.20  per  day  for  trainees  without  children  under  seven  years  of  age,  and  to  about 
8:205:15162:27:28:71:354:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:USD$3.00 per day for women with children under seven.5

8:211:15714:28:27:71:542:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:youth  completed  only  the classroom  component.  A  substantial  fraction  of  the  overall  payment, 
8:212:15818:27:28:71:542:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:instead,  was  conditioned  on the  student completing  the  apprenticeship  with  the  participating 
8:213:15920:28:28:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:firms  in  a  timely  fashion (see FIP  and  DNP,  2001). Moreover,  the  ECAPs  would  receive 
8:214:16016:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:additional payments  if  the  beneficiaries  were  hired  by  the  firms  that  trained  them.  To  the 
8:215:16120:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:government,  the  total  cost  of  the program is  the  sum  of  the  cost  of  the  course,  plus  the 
8:216:16224:28:27:71:543:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:maintenance transfers disbursed during the six months (See FIP and DNP, 2001). This incentive

8:218:16429:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:market,  was  one  of  the  most  innovative  characteristics  of  the  program,  especially compared to

9:237:18179:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the respondents in the evaluation survey several years after the completion of the intervention. In

9:247:19020:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Here we stress that this design maintains a selection role for the ECAPS, which can be important

9:249:19216:27:28:71:421:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:incentives to select individuals that would complete the entire program.

10:265:20317:27:28:71:542:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employees.  Firms  must  report  each  month  the  amount  contributed for each  one  of  their 
10:266:20413:28:28:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employees.  The  Ministry  of  Social  Protection  has  universal  coverage  of  all  the  monthly 
10:267:20512:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contributions  in  the  country  since July 2008.  Thus,  this  data  provides  us  with  the  possibility of 
10:268:20622:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:following  up  the  individuals  in  the  evaluation  survey  and  constructing  a  longitudinal  database

10:273:21145:27:28:71:247:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and exiting the formal labor market.

10:276:21300:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:index  is  constructed  as  a  weighted  average  of  a  number  of  household  level  variables.8

10:280:21685:16:0:71:356:87:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:components of the SISBEN and their weight are periodically updated.  
11:281:21799:0:27:71:542:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:routinely administered to about the 60% poorest segment of the population in Colombia.9   In our 
11:282:21896:27:28:71:543:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:analysis, we use the surveys collected between mid 2009 and early 2015. We then match, using a 
11:283:21991:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:variety  of  methods  and  information  sources,  the  data  from  the  evaluation  survey  with  the 
11:284:22093:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SISBEN  data.  We  therefore  construct  a  long-run  follow  up  with  the  matched  applicants’,  and 
11:285:22197:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:their  households’  characteristics,  at  the  date  their  surveys  were  collected.  Since  this  survey  is  a 
11:286:22311:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:census of the poorest population, applicants that were not matched to it are assumed to belong to

11:288:22451:28:27:71:543:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:An individual can, in principle, be in both administrative data and many indeed are. However, it 
11:289:22548:27:28:71:543:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is  clear  that  the  two  data  sources  are  somewhat  complementary:  somebody  with a  formal 
11:290:22646:28:28:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment  and  high  earnings  will  be  found  in  the  PILA  data  sets  but  will  be, ceteris  paribus 
11:291:22754:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:less  likely  to  be  in  the  SISBEN data  base.  Conversely, people  in  the  SISBEN  data,  as  they  are 
11:292:22863:27:28:71:386:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:being targeted by welfare programs are less likely to be in PILA.

15:400:30278:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not. However, starting in 2011, we find an increasing gap in favor of the beneficiaries. The gap is 
15:401:30378:28:27:71:543:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:larger  for  men  than  for  women. It  should  be  remembered, however, that this  is  a  self-selected

17:422:31323:27:28:71:452:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:To estimate the long term impacts of the program we use the following model:

17:424:31419:29:28:71:542:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Where Yij  is  the  outcome  of  person i  in  site  and  course j, Di  is  the  treatment indicator,  and  it  is 
17:425:31534:28:28:71:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:equal  to  0  if  the  applicant  was  randomly  denied  a  place  in  course j,  or  1  if  he  was  randomly 
17:426:31645:28:27:71:542:577:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:offered a place in it, Xi is a vector of characteristics of the applicants at baseline, such as gender, 
17:427:31749:27:28:71:542:550:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:initial  employment  and  experience,  education  and  so  on. Considering  that  randomization  in  the 
17:428:31854:28:28:71:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:experimental design took place at the course level, we include SCj, a site-by-course fixed effect, 
17:429:31953:28:30:71:542:494:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which allows us to interpret our parameter of interest (α) as the weighted average of the program 
17:430:32050:30:28:71:543:464:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effects  across  all  courses. Finally, εij  is  a  random  error  term.  In  all  of  our  estimates  below  we 
17:431:32163:28:28:71:543:436:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:compute robust standard errors, clustered at the site-by-course level, and whenever we use panel 
17:432:32260:28:27:71:282:408:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data, we cluster them at the applicant level. 
17:433:32306:27:28:71:542:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We  present  estimates  of  the  “intent  to  treat”  effect,  that  is,  the  mean  effect  of  the  offer  of 
17:434:32418:28:28:71:543:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:treatment. However, since compliance among applicants is 97%, our estimates should not differ 
17:435:32512:28:27:71:543:325:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:substantially  from  the average treatment  effect in  this  population. We  weigh  each  applicant  by 
17:436:32616:27:28:71:542:298:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f2:B:PSCi (1-PSCi), where PSCi is the population probability, taken from administrative records, that an 
17:437:32716:28:27:71:542:270:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:applicant i,  that  applied  to  course C,  at  site S,  be  offered  a  place.  While  we  report  the  results 
17:438:32829:27:28:71:542:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:obtained  using  this  weighting  scheme,  we  also  compute  unweighted  estimates,  which  are 
17:439:32926:28:28:71:542:215:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:available  on  request.  Weighing  does  not  make  any  substantial  difference to  our  results  or

20:535:37735:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:associated  to  this  effect  is  0.025.    This  shows  a  remarkable  persistence  of  the  effects  of  the 
20:536:37846:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:program, beyond the cost-benefit analysis in AKM, where a 10% depreciation rate was assumed. 
20:537:37939:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:In terms of pesos, the effect is similar for males and females, at about 35k (Table 3), although for 
20:538:38040:28:28:71:543:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:women  it  represents  a  higher  percentage increase:  female  earnings  in  the  control  group  are 
20:539:38143:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:COL$200,000,   while   those   for   males   are   COL$327,000.   Thus   the   respective   percentage 
20:540:38246:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increases  are  17.5%  for  females  and  10.7%  for  males.  Once  we  control  for  multiple  testing  the 
20:541:38355:28:27:71:473:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:female effect is significant at the 6.5% level, while the male effect is insignificant.

20:544:38539:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increased by 4 percentage points as a result of the program (Table 2). This effect is significant at 
20:545:38640:27:28:71:543:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the 1% level (RW p-value=0.009).  When we look at the same impacts separately for women and 
20:546:38732:28:27:71:542:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:men, in Table 3, we find that for females the probability of being a formal employee increases by 
20:547:38830:27:28:71:539:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:5   percentage  points  (RW  p-value  of  0.052).  For  males, the  point  estimate  is  similar  and  the  t-
20:548:38940:28:28:71:543:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:statistic  is  1.89,  but  the  adjusted  RW  p-value  is 0.25 and  is  therefore  not  statistically  different 
20:549:39053:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from zero. Participants in JeA worked on average 3.33 months longer in the formal sector, quite

20:553:39412:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through  promotion  opportunities  and  may  be  a  proxy  for  higher  quality  jobs.  We  find  that  the

20:555:39615:27:28:71:543:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:down the impact by gender we find a 3.8pp effect for women (p-value 0.065). For men the effect 
20:556:39710:28:27:71:235:110:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is 2.5pp and totally insignificant.

21:559:39831:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The  estimated  effects  point  to  a  strong  and  persistent  effect  of  the  program  on  working  in  the

21:561:40040:27:28:71:542:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  the  trainees  have  become  more  productive.  This  is  not  an 
21:562:40149:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:issue that  can  be  assessed  experimentally  simply  because  we only  observe  earnings  conditional 
21:563:40253:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on  working  in  the  formal  sector;  in  other  words  comparing  the  formal  earnings  of  those  who 
21:564:40359:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:went through the program to the formal earnings of those who did not,  as pointed out in AKM is 
21:565:40455:28:27:71:543:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:subject to selection bias, because of the effect of the program on formality. Trainees who select 
21:566:40553:27:28:71:543:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:into  the  formal  sector are  likely  to  be  very different  from  controls  who  select  into  the  same 
21:567:40661:28:28:71:109:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sector.  
21:568:40670:28:27:107:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:One possibility is to bound the effects on earnings, following an approach similar to that 
21:569:40761:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:used by AKM. To  sharpen  the  bounds  they relied only on  a  monotonicity  assumption,  i.e.  that 
21:570:40862:28:27:71:543:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participating  in  training  could  not  discourage  work.  However  they  had  to  deal  with  a selection 
21:571:40970:27:28:71:539:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:problem   less  severe    than  what  we  are  facing, as missing  earnings  were  confined  to  non-
21:572:41071:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:workers.  In  contrast  to  this  study, they  also  observed  the  earnings  of  those  with  jobs  in  the 
21:573:41180:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:informal sector. Therefore, to get tighter bounds in our context, we impose stronger restrictions 
21:574:41278:27:28:71:200:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as in Angrist et al. (2006). 
21:575:41307:28:27:107:542:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In particular, we assume that the training program could not lead to a decline in earnings,

21:577:41502:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is  not  an innocuous  assumption  because  it  states  that  lost  experience  from  participating  in 
21:578:41606:28:28:71:542:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:training has either negligible effects or is dominated by the effects of training. Now, define 푇!!"

22:584:42173:28:29:71:539:661:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Angrist (1995).11 Define 푞!휃 to be the θ-quantile of the distribution of Y0, and 푞!휃 the θ-

22:601:43277:28:28:71:542:187:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:equation  (2),  based  on  the  applicants’ formal earnings,  as reported when they contributed to 
22:602:43376:28:27:71:542:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health,  disability,  pensions, from  which  we  take the  maximum. We estimate  lower  and  upper 
22:603:43475:27:33:71:542:132:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bounds  at  different  percentile  levels.  First,  including  all  control  individuals  matched  to  PILA

23:607:43832:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The table shows that, for women, the upper bound of the impact of the JeA program on earnings 
23:608:43925:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is  positive,  significantly  different  from  zero  and  large.  It  is  particularly  high  at  the  65th  and  the 
23:609:44043:27:28:71:543:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:85th  percentiles:  the  shape  of  the  impacts  is  U-shaped,  with  a  minimum  at  the  75th  percentile, 
23:610:44153:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:both in absolute and percentage terms. For men, the story is very different: the upper bounds on 
23:611:44250:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the impacts are much smaller and never significantly different from zero. For the overall sample, 
23:612:44348:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  impact  reflects  the  pattern  of  the  impact  of  women,  except  that  the  minimum  is  at  the  75th 
23:613:44459:28:27:71:542:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentile. As for the lower bounds, they are never significantly different from zero. In the case 
23:614:44558:27:28:71:404:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of men, all point estimates of the lower bound are actually negative.  
23:615:44628:28:28:71:74:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: 
23:616:44628:28:27:71:542:441:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:In  panel  B,  we  also  condition  on  the  specific  ECAP  individuals  attended,  and  compute  bounds 
23:617:44734:27:28:71:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:based on equation (3). In this case, we still find positive and significant upper bounds, although 
23:618:44833:28:27:71:542:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:their point estimates are smaller than those in Panel A. The lower bounds are higher than those in 
23:619:44932:27:28:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Panel  A,  and  at  the  65th  percentile  the  lower  bound  is  significantly  positive  for  women  at  the 
23:620:45043:28:28:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:10%.  For  men,  again,  we  find  much  smaller  impacts  and,  again,  all  lower  bounds  are  negative 
23:621:45150:28:27:71:542:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and, in the case of the 85th percentile, significantly different from zero. The point estimate of the 
23:622:45252:27:28:71:455:276:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:upper bounds in the 85th percentile is negative (although not significantly so).12 
23:623:45334:28:27:71:542:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We  summarize  the  evidence  from  the  bounds  by  saying  that  there  is  some  suggestive  evidence 
23:624:45439:27:28:71:543:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that the program might have improved the productivity in the formal sector of the female youths 
23:625:45535:28:28:71:542:193:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:who received it. The increase in formal earnings for men, instead, seems to be completely driven 
23:626:45632:28:27:71:410:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:by the increasing formality, rather than by an increase in productivity.

23:629:45751:7:16:71:542:115:42:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:12 We do observe that the JeA effect increases with time: the estimates in table 4 imply a relative increase in earnings 
23:630:45872:16:12:71:541:99:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:for  women  of  9.2%,  but  when  we  get  the  lower  bound  estimate  using  only  2014  data,  its  relative  effect  becomes 
23:631:46001:12:0:71:102:87:97:g_d0_f2:97:g_d0_f2:F:14.1%.

24:638:46179:28:27:71:542:221:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we present evidence on the contribution records of these formal workers as an additional 
24:639:46277:27:28:71:549:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:way  of  corroborating  the  increase  in  participation  in  formal  sector.  Thus, Table 5   presents  the

24:642:46594:28:0:71:542:111:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contributions, overall and for women, but not for men. Finally, in Table B.1 in the appendix we

27:793:52967:27:28:71:542:207:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:women,   who   showed   an   increase   in   earnings   and   an   increase   in   formal   employment. 
27:794:53071:28:27:71:542:179:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Nevertheless  the  key  question  is  whether  the  effects  are  sustained. In  this paper,  we use 
27:795:53172:27:28:71:542:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:administrative  data  to  follow  up  the  subjects  in  the  experiment  and  show  that  the  effects  on 
27:796:53280:28:28:71:542:124:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:women are sustained. Specifically there is a long run increase in participation in the formal labor 
27:797:53380:28:0:71:543:96:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:market of  about  4%.  Moreover, female formal earnings  of  about  18%.  No  significant  effect  is 
28:798:53528:0:27:71:543:717:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:found for men, although the impacts are positive. In the case of women, the cost benefit analysis 
28:799:53626:27:28:71:542:690:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with no skill depreciation attributes a 29% internal rate of return. We also bounded the effect on 
28:800:53725:28:27:71:542:662:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:productivity and at least for women these do not include zero indicating an improvement there as 
28:801:53822:27:28:71:418:635:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:well (although the lower bound is not significantly different from zero). 
28:802:53896:28:28:71:542:607:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:By all accounts this has been a successful program with sustained effects. Given the importance 
28:803:53992:28:27:71:542:579:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for growth of reducing the size of the informal sector and moving people into the formal one the 
28:804:54089:27:28:71:542:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lessons learnt from this program should be replicated. Evidence on the relative importance of the 
28:805:54187:28:27:71:542:524:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:classroom component vis a vis the work experience one would be very useful. Our belief is that 
28:806:54282:27:28:71:408:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the combination of the two contributed to the success of the program.

36:1013:66044:25:27:71:542:648:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The  first  component  was  expected  to  last  between  280  and  350  hours  and  was  focused  both  on 
36:1014:66151:27:28:71:542:621:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the development of basic abilities for becoming employed (independent of the specific field), and 
36:1015:66249:28:28:71:543:593:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  development  of  occupation  specific  skills.  The  former  objective  was  pursued  by  providing 
36:1016:66354:28:27:71:542:565:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  youths  with  basic  social  abilities  and  developing  their  soft  skills:  teaching  them  to  be 
36:1017:66461:27:28:71:542:538:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:proactive, resourceful and open to feedback; improving their verbal and written communication 
36:1018:66555:28:27:71:543:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:skills; their analytic, deductive and daily work problems solving skills; by encouraging them to 
36:1019:66652:27:28:71:542:483:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assimilate  and  understand  their  job’s  organizational  environment;  by  developing  teamwork 
36:1020:66750:28:27:71:542:455:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:skills, etc. The latter goal was pursued by providing training in the specific field of their interest, 
36:1021:66854:27:28:71:542:428:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:including the expertise in the use of equipment and tools, didactic material, and the procurement

36:1025:67106:28:27:71:542:317:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hours  long,  conditional  on  the  labor  schedule  of  the  specific  firms  in  which  the  youths  were 
36:1026:67214:27:28:71:542:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trained.  The  training  institutions,  ECAPs,  when  designing  the  training  courses,  they  had  to 
36:1027:67318:28:28:71:542:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:identify  participating  employers  that  would  take  the  young  trainees  on  an  apprenticeship basis. 
36:1028:67425:28:27:71:542:234:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The  ECAPS  also  wrote  a training  plan to  facilitate  the  completion  in  the  firm  of  the  training 
36:1029:67532:27:28:71:542:207:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:process that began in their classrooms. It also includes an assessment of the youths’ performance
