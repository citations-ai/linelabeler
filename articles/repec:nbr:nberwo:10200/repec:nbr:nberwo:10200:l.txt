2:29:1344:30:24:72:540:566:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:Acquiring-firm shareholders lost 12 cents at the announcement of acquisitions for every dollar spent
2:30:1444:24:27:72:540:542:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:on acquisitions for a total loss of $240 billion from 1998 through 2001, whereas they lost $7 billion
2:31:1545:27:28:72:540:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:in all of the 1980s, or 1.6 cents per dollar spent. Though the announcement losses to acquiring-firm
2:32:1645:28:28:72:540:487:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:shareholders in the 1980s are more than offset by gains to acquired-firm shareholders, the losses of
2:33:1745:28:27:72:540:459:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:bidders  exceed  the  gains  of  targets  from  1998  through  2001  by  $134  billion.  The  1998-2001
2:34:1848:27:28:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:aggregate  dollar  loss  of  acquiring-firm  shareholders  is  so  large  because  of  a  small  number  of
2:35:1955:28:28:72:540:404:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:acquisition announcements by firms with extremely high valuations. Without these announcements,
2:36:2050:28:28:72:539:376:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:the wealth of acquiring-firm shareholders would have increased. The large losses are consistent with
2:37:2150:28:28:72:540:348:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:the existence of negative synergies from the acquisitions, but the size of the losses in relation to the
2:38:2254:28:28:72:539:320:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:consideration paid for the acquisitions is large enough that part of the losses most likely results from
2:39:2358:28:28:71:539:292:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:investors reassessing the standalone value of the bidders. Firms that announce acquisitions with
2:40:2454:28:33:71:291:264:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:?:large dollar losses perform poorly afterwards.

3:57:2835:0:25:90:164:709:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:C:1. Introduction 
3:58:2851:25:25:107:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we examine the experience of acquiring-firm shareholders in the recent merger 
3:59:2944:25:25:89:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:wave and compare it to their experience in the merger wave of the 1980s. Such an investigation is 
3:60:3042:25:26:89:527:634:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:important  because  the  recent  merger  wave  is  the  largest  by  far  in  American  history.  It  is  
3:61:3148:26:25:89:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:associated  with  higher  stock  valuations,  greater  use  of  equity  as  a  form  of  payment  for  
3:62:3251:25:25:89:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:transactions,  and  more  takeover  defenses  in  place  than  the  merger  wave  of  the  1980s.1  Though  
3:63:3359:25:26:89:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:these  differences  suggest  poorer  returns  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders,  there  are  also  several  
3:64:3468:26:25:89:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reasons why the acquiring-firm shareholders may have better returns. With the growth of options 
3:65:3564:25:25:89:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as  a  form  of  managerial  compensation  in  the  1990s,  managerial  wealth  is  more  closely  tied  to  
3:66:3673:25:25:89:526:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stock  prices,  making  management  more  conscious  of  the  impact  of  acquisitions  on  the  stock  
3:67:3777:25:26:89:527:457:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:price.  Further,  it  is  possible  that  acquisitions  in  the  recent  merger  wave  were  undertaken  to  
3:68:3886:26:25:89:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:exploit more valuable operating synergies and that some of these greater gains were captured by 
3:69:3982:25:25:89:220:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm shareholders.  
3:70:4012:25:26:107:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We find that from 1991 to 2001 (the 1990s), acquiring firms' shareholders lost an aggregate 
3:71:4104:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$216  billion,  or  more  than  50  times  the  $4  billion  they  lost  from  1980  to  1990  (the  1980s),  yet  
3:72:4219:25:25:89:524:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms spent just 6 times as much on acquisitions in the latter period. We measure the dollar loss of 
3:73:4320:25:25:89:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm  shareholders  as  the  change  in  the  acquiring  firm’s  capitalization  over  the  three  
3:74:4429:25:26:89:527:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:days  surrounding  economically  significant  acquisition  announcements  (defined  as  transactions  
3:75:4531:26:25:89:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:exceeding  1%  of  the  market  value  of  the  assets  of  the  acquirer),  which  we  call  the  acquisition  
3:76:4643:25:25:89:525:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:dollar return, and sum these losses to get the aggregate loss. Figure 1 shows the yearly aggregate 
3:77:4742:25:26:89:524:204:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:losses to acquiring-firm shareholders for our sample of acquisitions of public firms, private firms, 
3:78:4843:26:25:89:521:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and subsidiaries from 1980 through 2001. The figure shows that the lion’s share of the acquiring-
3:79:4940:25:44:89:518:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firm shareholder losses took place from 1998 through 2001. After losing $4 billion in the 1980s,  
3:80:5038:44:8:234:237:109:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:?:                                                      
3:81:5091:8:16:90:525:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1  Comment  and  Schwert  (1995)  show  that  87%  of  exchange-listed firms are covered by poison pill rights 
3:82:5202:16:11:89:525:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:issues, control share laws, and business combination laws in the early 1990s. They conclude “poison pills 
3:83:5308:11:0:89:432:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and control share laws are reliably associated with higher takeover premiums” (p. 3). 
4:84:5396:0:25:90:527:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm  shareholders  gained  $24  billion  from  1991  through  1997  before  losing  $240  
4:85:5497:25:25:90:524:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:billion from 1998 through 2001. The large losses from 1998 through 2001 cannot be explained by 
4:86:5592:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a  wealth  transfer  from  acquiring-firm  shareholders  to  acquired-firm  shareholders.  We  find  that  
4:87:5699:26:25:90:525:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate combined value of acquiring and acquired firms falls by a total of $134 billion for 
4:88:5797:25:25:90:445:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the sample of public firm acquisition announcements from 1998 through 2001.   
4:89:5875:25:25:107:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To understand why acquiring-firm shareholders lost so much during the recent merger wave, 
4:90:5965:25:26:90:524:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we have to investigate why they lost so much at the end of the 1990s. The large aggregate dollar 
4:91:6062:26:25:90:526:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  we  document  is  not  caused  by  a  worsening  of  the  mean  abnormal  return  associated  with  
4:92:6168:25:25:90:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition  announcements  because,  even  though  the  mean  abnormal  return  is  lower  in  the  late  
4:93:6275:25:26:90:528:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1990s,  it  is  still  positive  so  that  the  average  acquisition  creates  wealth  for  acquiring-firm  
4:94:6383:26:25:90:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders.  Instead,  this  large  loss  is  caused  by  an  increase  in  the  size  of  the  dollar  losses  of  
4:95:6501:25:25:90:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions with the worst dollar returns that is not offset by an equivalent increase in the size of 
4:96:6604:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the dollar gains of acquisitions with the best dollar returns. Statistically, the distribution of dollar 
4:97:6709:25:26:90:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  in  the  late  1990s  exhibits  substantially  more  skewness  compared  to  earlier  years.  At  the  
4:98:6821:26:25:90:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:same time, the amount spent on the acquisitions with the worst returns increases much more than 
4:99:6917:25:25:89:526:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  amount  spent  on  other  acquisitions,  so  acquisitions  with  the  worst  returns  correspond  to  a  
4:100:7027:25:26:89:525:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:larger fraction of the amount spent than before. A good illustration is that the fraction of the total 
4:101:7130:26:25:89:526:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:amount  spent  on  acquisitions  accounted  for  by  the  acquisitions  in  the  first  percentile  of  the  
4:102:7239:25:25:89:505:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of dollar returns increases from 13.68% for 1980-1997 to 32.74% for 1998-2001.  
4:103:7332:25:26:107:527:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Since  the  large  loss  of  acquiring-firm  shareholders  is  the  result  of  a  small  number  of  
4:104:7434:26:25:89:526:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition  announcements  with  extremely  large  losses,  we  investigate  the  bottom  tail  of  the  
4:105:7540:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of dollar returns to understand why the 1998-2001 acquiring-firm dollar losses differ 
4:106:7639:25:26:89:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from those in the 1980s and in the 1990s prior to 1998. Although the definition of the bottom tail 
4:107:7738:26:25:89:526:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of  a  statistical  distribution  is  somewhat  arbitrary,  we  choose  to  focus  on  the  acquisitions  with  
4:108:7850:25:25:89:526:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholder  wealth  losses  in  excess  of  $1  billion,  which  we  call  the  large  loss  deals.  Out  of  the  
4:109:7966:25:0:89:525:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:4,136  acquisitions  from  1998  through  2001,  87  are  large  loss  deals.  The  aggregate  wealth  loss  
5:110:8077:0:25:90:524:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:associated with these acquisitions is $397 billion, while all other acquisitions made a total gain of 
5:111:8179:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$157  billion.  The  large  loss  deals  represent  only  2.1%  of  the  1998-2001  acquisitions,  but  they  
5:112:8289:25:26:90:338:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:account for 43.4% of the money spent on acquisitions.   
5:113:8345:26:25:107:526:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Why  is  it  then  that  the  period  from  1998  through  2001  is  associated  with  this  clustering  of  
5:114:8454:25:25:90:527:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition  announcements  with  extremely  large  losses  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders?  The  
5:115:8555:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:dollar return associated with an acquisition announcement reflects both the net present value for 
5:116:8653:25:26:90:525:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  acquiring-firm  shareholders  of  the  acquisition  itself  as  well  as  what  the  acquisition  reveals  
5:117:8765:26:25:90:526:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:about  the  acquiring  firm.  Firm  characteristics  and  deal  characteristics  found  to  be  important  in  
5:118:8876:25:25:90:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:explaining  these  two  contributions  to  acquirer  announcement  returns  explain  only  part  of  the  
5:119:8982:25:26:90:524:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal return associated with our large loss deals. On average, large loss deals have a negative 
5:120:9081:26:27:90:526:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  return  of  −10.6%.  Using  regression  models  estimated  over  the  period  1980-1997,  we  
5:121:9185:27:25:90:419:429:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:can explain at most one fifth of that negative abnormal return on average.  
5:122:9261:25:25:107:525:404:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Since  Dong,  Hirshleifer,  Richardson,  and  Teoh  (2003)  show  that  firms  with  high  valuation  
5:123:9363:25:25:89:525:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ratios  (which  they  call  overvalued)  have  poor  abnormal  returns,  perhaps  because  the  acquisition  
5:124:9472:25:26:89:524:354:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcement provides evidence that management believes the firm to be overvalued, our result 
5:125:9566:26:25:89:525:328:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:could  be  an  outcome  of  a  period  with  many  highly  valued  firms.  The  firms  that  make  the  large  
5:126:9677:25:25:89:526:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  deals  have  indeed  high  q’s  and  low  book-to-market  (BM)  ratios  among  all  firms  making  
5:127:9782:25:26:89:525:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions.  The  acquisition  announcements  of  these  firms  are  positive  on  average  in  the  years  
5:128:9892:26:25:89:524:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:immediately before they make their large loss deal even though they are also highly valued when 
5:129:9988:25:25:89:526:227:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:they  make  these  previous  announcements.  However,  the  acquisitions  made  by  firms  that  make  
5:130:10091:25:26:89:526:202:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large  loss  deals  after  they  announce  their  large  loss  deals  are  not  associated  with  increases  in  
5:131:10204:26:25:89:525:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholder wealth. The evidence is therefore consistent with the hypothesis advanced by Jensen 
5:132:10300:25:25:89:526:151:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(2003)  that  high  valuations  increase  managerial  discretion,  making  it  possible  for  managers  to  
5:133:10408:25:25:89:527:126:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:make  poor  acquisitions  when  they  have  run  out  of  good  ones.  However,  the  extremely  poor  
5:134:10511:25:0:89:526:101:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  of  firms  announcing  the  large  loss  deals  and  the  size  of  the  losses  in  comparison  to  the  
6:135:10628:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:consideration paid suggest also that investors learn from the announcements that the stand-alone 
6:136:10725:25:25:90:364:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:value of the announcing firms is not as high as they thought.   
6:137:10789:25:26:107:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we  introduce  our  sample,  document  aggregate  
6:138:10892:26:25:89:526:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholder  losses,  and  demonstrate  how  the  distribution  of  acquiring-firm  shareholder  losses  
6:139:10997:25:25:89:525:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:evolves through time. In Section 3, we show that the shareholder losses between 1998 and 2001 
6:140:11091:25:25:89:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:can  be  explained  by  the  large  loss  deals  and  we  establish  in  Section  4  that  large  loss  deals  are  
6:141:11207:25:26:89:528:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:statistically  and  economically  significant.    In  Section  5,  firm  and  deal  characteristics  are  
6:142:11313:26:25:89:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:investigated  to  see  if  they  can  explain  the  large  loss  deals.  We  investigate  in  Section  6  whether  
6:143:11428:25:25:89:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  large  loss  deals  result  from  the  extremely  high  valuations  of  the  firms  that  announce  these  
6:144:11540:25:26:89:526:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals.  In  Section  7,  we  show  that  the  firms  that  make  large  loss  deals  perform  very  poorly  
6:145:11648:26:25:89:262:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:afterwards. We conclude in Section 8.

6:149:11790:25:25:107:526:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To  evaluate  the  performance  of  acquisitions  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders,  we  focus  on  
6:150:11891:25:25:89:526:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  that  are  material  to  the  acquirer.  We  investigate  samples  of  acquisitions  where  the  
6:151:12002:25:26:89:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deal  value  corresponds  to  10%,  5%,  and  1%  of  the  market  value  of  the  assets  of  the  acquirer  
6:152:12112:26:25:89:526:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(defined  as  the  book  value  of  assets  minus  the  book  value  of  equity  plus  the  market  value  of  
6:153:12223:25:25:89:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:equity). We report results for the 1% threshold but our conclusions hold for the more restrictive 
6:154:12321:25:26:89:361:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:samples. In addition, the sample meets the following criteria: 
6:155:12384:26:25:125:481:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:1. The announcement date occurs from in the period from 1980 through 2001;  
6:156:12459:25:25:125:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:2. The  acquirer  controls  less  than  50%  of  the  shares  of  the  target  at  the  announcement  
6:157:12560:25:26:143:504:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:?:date and obtains 100% of the target shares if the target is a public or private firm; 
6:158:12646:26:0:125:377:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:3. The deal value is equal to or greater than $1 million; 
7:159:12705:0:25:126:487:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:4. The target is a U.S. public firm, private firm, subsidiary, division, or branch;2 
7:160:12788:25:25:125:354:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:5. The acquirer is listed on CRSP and Compustat; 
7:161:12836:25:26:125:441:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:6. The deal is successfully completed in less than one thousand days.  
7:162:12906:26:25:107:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 shows the number of acquisitions and the total consideration spent on acquisitions for 
7:163:13001:25:25:89:525:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:each  year  in  our  sample.  A  comparison  of  the  amount  spent  on  acquisitions  in  the  1990s  to  the  
7:164:13113:25:25:89:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:amount spent in the 1980s shows how extraordinary the volume of acquisitions of the late 1990s 
7:165:13208:25:26:89:525:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:was:  from  1998  through  2001,  $1,992  billion  is  spent  on  acquisitions,  while  less  than  a  half  of  
7:166:13321:26:25:89:524:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that amount is spent from 1991 through 1997 and roughly a quarter of that amount is spent from 
7:167:13416:25:25:89:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1980  through  1990.  Further,  there  are  roughly  twice  as  many  acquisitions  from  1998  through  
7:168:13521:25:26:89:237:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:2001 than through all the 1980s.  
7:169:13555:26:25:107:527:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Though  the  literature  has  focused  on  abnormal  percentage  returns,  these  returns  do  not  
7:170:13655:25:25:89:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:capture  the  change  in  wealth  of  acquiring-firm  shareholders  as  noted  by  Malatesta  (1983).  For  
7:171:13763:25:25:89:524:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm shareholders, the same percentage return changes their wealth more if the acquirer 
7:172:13861:25:26:89:521:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is a large firm than if it is a small firm. Dollar returns capture the change in wealth of acquiring-
7:173:13962:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firm shareholders. The sum of the dollar returns divided by the sum of the equity capitalization of 
7:174:14062:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the acquiring firm corresponds to a value-weighted return. We add up the dollar returns across all 
7:175:14161:25:26:89:525:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  each  year  and  report  the  results  in  Table  1.  Throughout  the  paper,  we  report  dollar  
7:176:14274:26:25:89:528:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  in  2001  dollars  (obtained  using  the  U.S.  Gross  Domestic  Product  Deflator).  It  is  
7:177:14377:25:25:89:526:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:immediately  clear  that  the  years  1998  through  2001  are  dramatically  different  from  the  years  
7:178:14484:25:26:89:524:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1980 through 1997. From 1980 through 1997, acquiring-firm shareholders lose $32 billion when 
7:179:14577:26:25:89:524:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions are announced, while acquiring-firm shareholders lost almost eight times more from 
7:180:14673:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1998  through  2001.  The  second  worst  four-year  period  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders  is  from  
7:181:14779:25:26:89:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1980 to 1983, where acquiring-firm shareholders lost $5.097 billion, or slightly more than 2% of 
7:182:14876:26:30:89:225:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the losses from 1998 to 2001.

7:184:14960:7:16:90:524:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2 In the following, we use subsidiary acquisition to designate the acquisition of a subsidiary, a division, or a 
7:185:15073:16:0:89:124:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:branch.  
8:186:15084:0:25:107:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Do  acquiring-firm  shareholders  lose  so  much  because  there  are  more  acquisitions,  because  
8:187:15185:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  typical  acquisition  has  a  worse  return,  or  because  of  some  other  reason?  To  consider  the  
8:188:15294:25:26:90:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that shareholders lose more because there are more acquisitions or firms make larger 
8:189:15390:26:25:90:526:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions,  we  can  compute  the  average  dollar  loss  per  acquisition  and  the  average  loss  per  
8:190:15499:25:25:90:525:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:dollar spent on acquisitions. Both numbers increase dramatically from the 1980s to the 1990s, so 
8:191:15596:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that the increase in the number or dollars spent on acquisitions cannot explain mechanically why 
8:192:15693:25:26:90:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders  lose  so  much  in  the  1990s.  From  1980  through  1990,  the  average  dollar  loss  per  
8:193:15801:26:25:90:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition is $1.945 million. From 1991 through 2001, the average dollar loss is $21.981 million, 
8:194:15900:25:25:90:524:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which is more than ten times more. The dollar loss per $100 spent on acquisitions is $0.88 cents 
8:195:15997:25:26:90:360:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from 1980 through 1990 and $7.38 from 1991 through 2001. 
8:196:16054:26:25:107:526:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To  investigate  whether  shareholders  lost  so  much  because  of  worse  abnormal  returns,  we  
8:197:16154:25:25:90:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the abnormal returns associated with acquisitions. Table 1 reports the average abnormal 
8:198:16251:25:25:90:527:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return  (CAR–1,+1)  for  each  year.  To  estimate  abnormal  returns,  we  use  standard  event  study  
8:199:16356:25:26:89:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:methods (see Brown and Warner (1985)) and compute market model abnormal returns using the 
8:200:16446:26:26:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:CRSP  equally-weighted  index  returns.  The  parameters  for  the  market  model  are  estimated  over  
8:201:16551:26:26:89:521:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  (−205, −6)  day  interval,  and  the  p-values  are  obtained  using  the  time-series  and  cross-
8:202:16655:26:25:89:524:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sectional variation of abnormal returns.3 The equally-weighted abnormal return for acquiring-firm 
8:203:16753:25:26:89:525:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders is positive every year except for two out of twenty-one. This contrasts sharply with 
8:204:16851:26:25:89:525:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  aggregate  dollar  return,  which  is  negative  for  eleven  years  out  of  twenty-one.  Further,  the  
8:205:16962:25:25:89:525:227:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:average yearly abnormal return is higher in the second half of our sample than in the first half. It 
8:206:17063:25:26:89:524:202:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is true that average yearly abnormal returns are lower from 1998 through 2001, but their average 
8:207:17160:26:25:89:526:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is  still  positive  and  only  trivially  smaller  than  the  average  across  all  years.4  Perhaps  the  most  
8:208:17274:25:25:90:526:151:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:striking  evidence  that  equally-weighted  average  abnormal  returns  are  not  helpful  to  understand  
8:209:17381:25:7:234:237:126:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:?:                                                      
8:210:17434:7:16:90:524:119:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:3 We also calculate abnormal returns using the value-weighted CRSP market return in the estimation of the 
8:211:17540:16:12:89:524:103:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:market model and in using net-of-market returns. Our results are not sensitive to using either definition of 
8:212:17649:12:0:89:162:91:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:abnormal returns. 
9:213:17669:0:25:90:524:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the change in aggregate wealth associated with acquisition announcements is the following. From 
9:214:17765:25:25:90:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1998 through 2001, the average abnormal return across all acquisitions is 0.69% and shareholders 
9:215:17862:25:26:90:524:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lose $240 billion; from 1987 through 1990, the average abnormal return across all acquisitions is 
9:216:17960:26:25:90:282:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:0.76% and shareholders gain $121 million. 
9:217:18002:25:25:107:524:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:If an acquisition involves synergy gains, the loss in value for the acquiring firm is more than 
9:218:18098:25:25:90:527:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:offset  by  the  gain  of  the  acquired  firm.  Bradley,  Desai,  and  Kim  (1988)  show  that  such  an  
9:219:18205:25:26:90:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:outcome  is  typical  for  their  sample  of  takeovers.  We  measure  the  impact  of  the  acquisition  
9:220:18311:26:25:90:526:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcement  on  the  combined  value  of  the  acquiring  firm  and  of  the  acquired  firm  in  percent  
9:221:18420:25:25:90:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns,  the  abnormal  return  synergy  gain,  and  in  dollars,  the  abnormal  dollar  synergy  gain,  
9:222:18527:25:26:90:349:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:following the method of Bradley, Desai, and Kim (1988).  
9:223:18584:26:25:107:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Table  1  shows  the  average  return  synergy  gain  and  the  sum  of  the  abnormal  dollar  synergy  
9:224:18689:25:25:89:526:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:gains  for  each  year.5  The  yearly  sum  of  the  abnormal  dollar  synergy  gains  exhibits  the  same  
9:225:18797:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:pattern as the aggregate dollar return for acquiring-firm shareholders. In the 1980s, the aggregate 
9:226:18897:25:26:90:524:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:dollar gain is $12 billion. However, from 1991 through 2001, the aggregate dollar gain is a loss of 
9:227:18997:26:25:90:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$90 billion. All of that loss and more takes place from 1998 through 2001. Simply stated, in the 
9:228:19094:25:25:90:529:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1980s   the   target-firm   shareholder   dollar   gains   exceed   the   dollar   losses   of   bidding-firm   
9:229:19206:25:26:90:527:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders,  but  in  the  1990s  the  target-firm  shareholders  earn  less  than  the  acquiring-firm  
9:230:19313:26:25:90:177:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders lose.   
9:231:19334:25:25:107:110:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A: 
9:232:19334:25:26:90:479:229:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:C:3. Where do the large aggregate dollar losses from 1998 through 2001 come from?  
9:233:19415:26:25:107:525:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Since dollar losses are small in the 1980s compared to 1998-2001 but the average abnormal 
9:234:19505:25:35:90:527:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  do  not  change  much,  the  statistical  explanation  for  the  large  losses  of  acquiring-firm  
9:235:19614:35:7:521:524:143:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:                                                                                                                                                              
9:236:19771:7:16:90:524:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 Harford (2003) examines industry merger waves. In his paper, abnormal returns are low at the end of such 
9:237:19878:16:7:89:323:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:waves, but his sample has only public firm acquisitions.    
9:238:19938:7:16:90:526:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5  Note  that  the  aggregate  dollar  synergy  gain  cannot  be  compared  to  the  aggregate  dollar  bidder  return  
9:239:20058:16:12:89:525:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:because  the  aggregate  dollar  bidder  return  includes  the  dollar  returns  associated  acquisitions  of  private  
9:240:20178:12:11:89:182:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:firms and subsidiaries. 
9:241:20202:11:0:89:92:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F: 
10:242:20204:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders must be that relatively few acquisitions were associated with extremely large dollar 
10:243:20302:25:25:90:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:losses. This means that the distribution of dollar returns must have changed so the dollar returns 
10:244:20401:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:at  the  lowest  percentiles  of  the  distribution  of  dollar  returns  are  much  worse  in  1998-2001  than  
10:245:20514:26:25:90:528:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:before.  Such  a  change  would  have  only  a  small  impact  on  the  mean  abnormal  return  of  
10:246:20614:25:25:90:518:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions because it would affect the abnormal returns of a small fraction of the observations.  
10:247:20714:25:25:107:526:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Figure  2  shows  a  box  plot  that  illustrates  how  the  distribution  of  dollar  returns  evolves  
10:248:20819:25:26:90:528:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:through   time.   From   1998   through   2001,   there   are   more   acquisition   announcements   with   
10:249:20927:26:25:90:524:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:extremely large dollar losses and gains than any other time. This corresponds to an increase in the 
10:250:21027:25:25:90:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:volatility  of  dollar  returns.  Strikingly,  the  yearly  volatility  of  dollar  returns  normalized  by  the  
10:251:21141:25:26:90:525:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:consideration paid, increases dramatically also. Compared to the 1980s, that volatility more than 
10:252:21239:26:25:90:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:triples.  However,  more  importantly,  the  increase  in  the  frequency  and  magnitude  of  large  dollar  
10:253:21349:25:25:90:526:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  acquisitions  dwarfs  the  increase  in  large  dollar  gain  acquisitions.  In  statistical  terms,  this  
10:254:21463:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:means that the negative skewness in the distribution of dollar returns increases sharply. This can 
10:255:21562:25:27:90:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:be seen in three ways. First, we simply compute skewness for the two sub-periods. The skewness 
10:256:21657:27:26:90:525:354:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient is −1.76 for 1980-1997 and −6.99 for 1998-2001, so skewness increases by more than 
10:257:21752:26:25:89:525:328:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:three  times.  Second,  we  compute  the  dollar  losses  corresponding  to  the  observations  with  dollar  
10:258:21862:25:25:89:526:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:losses  in  the  5th  and  95th  percentiles  of  the  distribution  of  dollar  returns  and  normalize  by  the  
10:259:21977:25:26:89:522:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate value of all transactions. The aggregate losses for the 5th and 95th percentiles for 1980-
10:260:22077:26:27:90:526:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1997  are,  respectively,  −6%  and  7%,  so  the  tails  of  the  distribution  are  almost  symmetric.  In  
10:261:22187:27:27:89:524:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, for the second sub-period, the aggregate losses for the 5th and 95th percentiles are −19% 
10:262:22287:27:25:90:525:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and 13% respectively, so the tails of the distribution are no longer symmetric. Third, in Figure 3, 
10:263:22387:25:25:90:528:173:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:diagnostic  plots  show  that  the  distribution  of  dollar  returns  in  1998-2001  departs  from  a  
10:264:22491:25:25:90:450:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:symmetric distribution more than the distribution of dollar returns in 1980-1997.  
10:265:22574:25:26:107:524:123:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:As Figure 2 shows, the large aggregate loss made by acquiring-firm shareholders is due to an 
10:266:22667:26:0:89:526:97:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increase  in  the  frequency  of  acquisitions  in  the  left  tail  of  the  distribution.  To  understand  this  
11:267:22784:0:25:90:524:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate loss, we need to understand why some acquisition announcements have such extremely 
11:268:22877:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large  dollar  shareholder  wealth  losses  from  1998  through  2001.  We  therefore  consider  those  
11:269:22981:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  where  the  dollar  loss  exceeds  $1  billion  in  2001  dollars  and  call  them  large  loss  
11:270:23092:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals. There are 87 acquisition announcements where acquiring-firm shareholders lose more than 
11:271:23187:25:25:90:528:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$1  billion  from  1998  to  2001.  The  total  loss  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders  from  these  
11:272:23289:25:25:90:526:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements  is  $397  billion.  If  we  exclude  these  87  acquisitions,  shareholders  of  acquiring  
11:273:23396:25:26:90:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms  gained  $157  billion  from  acquisition  announcements  from  1998  through  2001.  In  other  
11:274:23499:26:25:90:531:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:words,   a   very   small   number   of   acquisition   announcements   explain   why   acquisition   
11:275:23601:25:25:90:522:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements are associated with an extremely large loss of acquiring-firm shareholder wealth.  
11:276:23698:25:26:108:527:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:These  acquisitions  have  extremely  large  dollar  losses  for  the  acquiring-firm  shareholders  
11:277:23799:26:25:90:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:compared to the consideration paid. On average, shareholders lose $2.31 per dollar spent on the 
11:278:23895:25:25:90:524:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition. The median loss is $0.73 per dollar spent. Such large losses suggest that an important 
11:279:23995:25:25:90:527:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:component  of  the  market’s  reaction  to  the  announcement  is  a  reassessment  of  the  standalone  
11:280:24100:25:26:90:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:value of the acquirer. In the literature, such a reassessment is often attributed to firms signaling a 
11:281:24203:26:25:90:527:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lack  of  internal  growth  opportunities  (McCardle  and  Viswanatan,  1994,  and  Jovanovic  and  
11:282:24303:25:25:90:524:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Braguinsky, 2002). Another source of reassessment emphasized in the literature is that firms that 
11:283:24401:25:26:90:399:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:pay with equity signal that their equity is overpriced (Travlos, 1987).  
11:284:24474:26:25:107:526:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Acquisition  announcements  with  shareholder  losses  in  excess  of  $1  billion  are  unusual,  as  
11:285:24577:25:25:89:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:seen  in  Table  2  which  presents  the  distribution  of  these  announcements  over  the  sample  period.  
11:286:24687:25:26:89:524:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:As is apparent, almost all large loss deals take place in the period 1998 to 2001. Symmetrically, if 
11:287:24788:26:25:89:525:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we define large gain deals to be those with a shareholder gain in excess of $1 billion, such deals 
11:288:24887:25:25:89:524:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are unusual also. There are more large gain deals before 1998 than there are large loss deals (23 
11:289:24985:25:26:89:526:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:versus  17).  However,  from  1998  to  2001,  the  number  of  large  gain  deals  is  only  64%  of  the  
11:290:25093:26:25:89:525:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:number  of  large  loss  deals.  Conditional  on  an  acquisition  having  a  dollar  return  in  excess  of  $1  
11:291:25207:25:0:89:525:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:billion in absolute value, the expected loss is about 50% larger than the expected gain. If we add 
12:292:25309:0:25:90:524:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:up all dollar returns from 1998 to 2001 that exceed $1 billion in absolute value, the total is –$236 
12:293:25410:25:25:90:512:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:billion, which is about equal to the total aggregate loss made by acquiring-firm shareholders.     
12:294:25509:25:26:107:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Because  the  large  loss  deals  are  clustered  in  1998-2001,  the  distribution  of  large  loss  deals  
12:295:25618:26:25:90:526:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:differs sharply from the distribution of the whole sample of acquisitions. Though approximately 
12:296:25714:25:25:90:525:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:34% of the mergers (4,136 out of 12,023) occur in 1998-2001, about 84% of the large loss deals 
12:297:25809:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(87 out of 104) occur in the same period. In comparison, 71% of the large gain deals take place in 
12:298:25908:25:26:90:524:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1998-2001. The four-year period from 1998 to 2001 represents 58% of the total amount spent on 
12:299:26002:26:25:90:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions for the entire sample, 1980 to 2001.  However, 90% of the amount spent on large loss 
12:300:26100:25:25:90:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals  is  spent  during  that  four-year  period.  In  contrast,  only  62%  of  the  amount  spent  on  large  
12:301:26213:25:26:90:527:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:gain  deals  is  spent  then.  From  1980  through  1997,  consideration  spent  on  large  loss  deals  
12:302:26318:26:25:90:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:represents 6.61% of the consideration spent on acquisitions. From 1998 through 2001, 43.41% of 
12:303:26413:25:25:90:526:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  amount  spent  on  acquisitions  corresponds  to  large  loss  deals.  In  comparison,  the  large  gain  
12:304:26524:25:25:90:522:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals are much less important since the aggregate amount spent on large gain deals is about one-
12:305:26620:25:26:90:338:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sixth of the aggregate amount spent on large loss deals.

12:308:26749:25:26:107:525:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we establish that the losses associated with the 87 large loss deals from 1998

12:310:26955:25:25:90:526:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:account  the  higher  stock  market  volatility  of  the  late  1990s,  are  not  the  result  of  large  firms  
12:311:27068:25:26:90:526:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:making  acquisitions  of  public  firms  paid  for  with  equity  that  have  average  abnormal  returns,  
12:312:27175:26:25:90:526:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cannot  be  explained  by  industry  or  market  returns,  cannot  be  explained  by  redistribution  from  
12:313:27283:25:25:90:450:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring firms to targets, and cannot be explained by unrelated announcements.

12:316:27440:25:25:108:525:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The last four years of our sample are years of high volatility, so it could simply be that large 
12:317:27537:25:0:90:525:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms experience billion dollar changes in value frequently and the large dollar losses associated 
13:318:27639:0:25:90:524:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with acquisition announcements would not be unusual for large firms during these years. It makes 
13:319:27736:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:no  sense  to  test  whether  the  cross-sectional  mean  of  raw  and  abnormal  returns  in  our  sample  is  
13:320:27848:25:26:90:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significantly negative. However, we can investigate whether the return of an announcing firm is 
13:321:27944:26:26:90:527:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significantly  different  from  zero  given  the  firm’s  time-series  of  returns.  Using  the  standard  
13:322:28051:26:26:90:525:607:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deviation  of  returns  for  each  firm  over  the  period  (−205, −6)  to  evaluate  whether  the  three-day  
13:323:28162:26:26:90:527:581:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return  for  each  firm  is  significantly  different  from  zero,  we  find  that  the  three-day  return  is  
13:324:28274:26:27:90:525:555:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant for only four firms. The average t-statistic for the three-day return is −5.399 and the 
13:325:28376:27:26:89:520:528:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:median is −4.486. We find similar results when we repeat the test using market model residuals.

13:328:28587:26:25:89:253:451:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:earning average abnormal returns?  
13:329:28622:25:25:107:528:426:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Table   1   looks   at   all   acquisitions   irrespective   of   how   they   are   financed   and   of   the

13:331:28840:25:26:89:525:376:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large firms have worse acquisition abnormal returns and the average abnormal return for a large 
13:332:28936:26:26:89:525:350:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firm (defined as a firm whose capitalization in the year the acquisition is announced exceeds the 
13:333:29034:26:26:89:525:324:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:25th percentile of NYSE firms) making a public acquisition financed with equity is −2.45% over

13:337:29374:25:25:107:526:222:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Can  the  evidence  on  equity-financed  acquisitions  of  public  firms  having  average  abnormal  
13:338:29475:25:25:89:526:197:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  explain  our  large  loss  deals?  The  answer  is  no  because  the  abnormal  return  associated  
13:339:29584:25:26:89:525:172:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with our large loss deals is too large. The average abnormal return of the large loss deals over the 
13:340:29685:26:25:89:528:146:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:three  days  surrounding  the  acquisition  announcement  is  −10.594%  and  the  median  loss  is  
13:341:29785:25:25:90:525:121:100:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f3:B:−8.081%. These negative abnormal returns are much larger than the mean and median abnormal 
13:342:29876:25:0:89:527:96:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  for  the  whole  sample  for  public  firm  acquisitions  paid  for  with  equity  or  for  all

14:344:30094:25:25:90:524:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal returns of acquisitions of public firms financed with equity for the whole sample period 
14:345:30192:25:26:90:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from 1980 through 2001, the abnormal returns for acquisitions of public firms paid for with some

14:347:30390:25:25:90:526:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  return  for  such  acquisitions  by  large  firms  is  -3.82%  in  contrast  to  -1.47%  from  1990  
14:348:30501:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:through 1997. The 56 large loss deals corresponding to acquisitions of public firms paid for with

14:350:30693:26:25:90:424:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of acquisitions of public firms paid for with some equity would be -2.94%.

14:352:30769:25:26:90:221:482:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:4.3. Do benchmarks matter?  
14:353:30797:26:25:107:526:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The  sample  of  large  loss  deals  is  constructed  using  the  change  in  the  announcing  firm’s  
14:354:30900:25:25:90:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:capitalization (dollar return) rather than the market adjusted change (abnormal dollar return). We 
14:355:30999:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:chose to proceed this way because we cannot exclude the possibility that some of our large loss 
14:356:31095:25:26:90:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals may have affected the market return. The aggregate abnormal dollar return associated with 
14:357:31191:26:25:90:526:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  87  large  loss  deals  is  a  loss  of  $397  billion  in  2001  dollars,  so  it  makes  little  difference  
14:358:31307:25:25:90:526:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:whether  we  use  the  abnormal  dollar  return  or  the  dollar  return.  If  we  use  the  dollar  abnormal  
14:359:31418:25:26:90:479:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return to construct a sample of large loss deals, the number of large loss deals is similar. 
14:360:31511:26:25:108:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We  know  that  from  1998  through  2001  there  were  days  with  dramatic  industry  returns.  The  
14:361:31614:25:25:90:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:low returns of the bidders in our sample of large loss deals could therefore be due to low returns 
14:362:31713:25:26:90:525:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in their industry on announcement days. A priori, this explanation would do better at explaining 
14:363:31810:26:25:90:525:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  large  loss  deals  in  2000  and  2001  than  the  earlier  ones  since  stock  prices  fell  on  average  in  
14:364:31927:25:25:90:526:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:these  years,  but  it  is  still  a  legitimate  concern.  Of  the  87  large  loss  deals  and  using  the  SDC  
14:365:32042:25:26:90:526:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:provided  SIC  codes,  38  acquirers  are  in  manufacturing.  Within  the  manufacturing  sector,  18  of  
14:366:32150:26:25:90:525:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  38  acquirers  are  in  the  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  2-digit  SIC  code.  To  investigate  
14:367:32262:25:25:90:524:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:industry effects, we construct a matching portfolio for each acquirer in our sample. This portfolio 
14:368:32362:25:0:90:525:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:uses  the  firms  in  the  same  4-digit  SIC  code  as  the  acquirer  when  we  can  find  ten  firms  or  more  
15:369:32480:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with that SIC code. If we cannot find at least ten firms in the acquirer’s 4-digit SIC code, we use 
15:370:32580:25:25:90:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the firms in the acquirer’s 2-digit SIC code. Large loss deal sample firms are excluded from the 
15:371:32677:25:26:90:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:matching portfolio. We then estimate the market model for the equally-weighted portfolio of the 
15:372:32773:26:25:90:532:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:matching    firms    and    compute    the    three-day    abnormal    return    of    the    portfolio.    Poor    
15:373:32889:25:26:90:526:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:contemporaneous  industry  returns  cannot  explain  the  large  loss  deals.  The  three-day  abnormal  
15:374:32994:26:26:90:526:582:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return  for  the  matching  firms  is  −0.55%  with  a  t-statistic  of  −2.085.  This  abnormal  return  is  a  
15:375:33107:26:26:89:526:556:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:small  fraction  of  the  abnormal  return  of  the  acquiring  firms.    When  we  subtract  the  industry  
15:376:33216:26:26:89:518:530:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio return from the raw return, the mean excess return is −10.37% (the median is −8.07%).

15:379:33411:25:25:107:526:453:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:By  requiring  acquiring  firms  to  have  a  dollar  announcement  loss  of  $1  billion,  we  do  not  
15:380:33516:25:26:90:525:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:constrain the percentage change or the dollar change of the combined value of the acquiring and 
15:381:33612:26:25:90:527:402:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquired  firms.  Consequently,  we  can  estimate  the  significance  of  the  average  percentage  or  
15:382:33717:25:25:90:524:377:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:dollar change in the combined value using the time-series and cross-sectional distribution for the 
15:383:33816:25:25:90:525:352:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deals that correspond to acquisitions of public firms as we did in the previous section 
15:384:33915:25:26:90:527:327:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for  the  whole  sample  of  public  firm  acquisitions.  The  combined  value  of  the  acquiring  and  
15:385:34020:26:25:90:526:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquired  firm  for  the  period  1998-2001  falls  by  more  than  7%,  which  is  significantly  different  
15:386:34130:25:25:90:525:276:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from zero at the one percent level. We further investigate the significance of the abnormal return 
15:387:34229:25:26:90:527:251:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:using  the  time-series  volatility  of  the  return  of  the  portfolio  of  the  acquiring  firm  and  of  the  
15:388:34343:26:27:90:525:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquired firm also. The average t-statistic is −3.312. The percentage synergy gain is positive and 
15:389:34442:27:25:90:451:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant for only five acquisitions. The dollar losses aggregate to $212 billion.

16:393:34531:0:25:90:458:709:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:4.5. Are the losses explained by news unrelated to the acquisition announcement?   
16:394:34614:25:25:126:527:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Since  the  aggregate  dollar  losses  are  due  to  few  acquisitions,  it  could  be  that  these  
16:395:34715:25:26:90:529:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions   correspond   to   abnormal   returns   that   can   be   explained   by   unrelated   news   
16:396:34823:26:25:90:525:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements rather than by the acquisition announcement. Using Dow-Jones News Retrieval, 
16:397:34914:25:25:90:524:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we searched extensively for unrelated announcements during the window (-2, +2) associated with 
16:398:35009:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  87  large  loss  deals.  These  large  loss  deals  are  made  by  very  large  corporations,  which  have  
16:399:35122:25:26:90:525:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:many  news  items.  For  some  large  loss  deals,  the  bidder  has  positive  announcements  during  the  
16:400:35230:26:25:90:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:event window, but for others it has negative announcements. Eliminating all large loss deals with 
16:401:35327:25:25:90:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements  that  could  be  construed  as  negative,  while  keeping  all  large  loss  deals  with  
16:402:35432:25:26:90:525:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:positive announcements, results in an aggregate dollar loss exceeding $300 billion dollars. Hence, 
16:403:35531:26:25:90:512:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the period 1998-2001 is unusual even when we use this estimate of losses biased towards zero.

16:405:35626:25:25:90:399:406:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:5. Can firm and deal characteristics explain the large loss deals?   
16:406:35695:25:26:107:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:There is now a considerable literature that relates acquiring-firm abnormal returns to firm and 
16:407:35791:26:25:89:524:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deal characteristics. This literature finds that abnormal returns are lower for acquisitions by firms 
16:408:35893:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with  low  leverage  (Maloney,  McCormick,  and  Mitchell,  1993),  low  Tobin’s  q  (Lang,  Stulz,  and

16:411:36204:25:25:90:530:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Rosenfeld,   1985),   overconfident   management   (Malmendier   and   Tate,   2003),   and   large

16:413:36407:26:25:90:526:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  of  public  firms  (Chang,  1998,  Fuller,  Netter,  and  Stegemoller,  2002),  acquisitions  
16:414:36515:25:25:90:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:opposed by target management (Schwert, 2000), conglomerate acquisitions (Morck, Shleifer, and 
16:415:36609:25:26:90:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Vishny, 1990), and acquisitions with competition (Bradley, Desai, and Kim, 1998) lead to lower 
16:416:36704:26:25:90:525:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm  abnormal  returns.  Finally,  there  is  evidence  that  the  relative  size  of  the  target  to  
16:417:36819:25:0:90:524:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the bidder matters (Asquith, Bruner, and Mullins, 1983), and that equity offers are associated with 
17:418:36922:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:poor bidder returns, but only for acquisitions of public firms (Travlos, 1987, Chang, 1998, Fuller, 
17:419:37022:25:25:90:524:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Netter, and Stegemoller, 2002). We first investigate whether the large loss deals and the firms that 
17:420:37123:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:make  them  have  characteristics  the  literature  has  identified  as  characteristics  associated  with  
17:421:37231:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:poorer shareholder returns than typical acquisitions. We then evaluate whether the large loss deals 
17:422:37331:25:25:90:526:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  large  dollar  losses  associated  with  acquisitions  from  1998-2001  can  be  explained  with  
17:423:37439:25:25:90:414:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regressions models estimated using the sample from 1980 through 1997.  
17:424:37510:25:26:90:93:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B: 
17:425:37510:26:25:90:527:532:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:F:5.1.  Do  large  loss  deals  and  the  firms  that  make  them  have  characteristics  that  make  low  
17:426:37615:25:25:90:256:507:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:acquisition abnormal returns likely?  
17:427:37653:25:26:107:524:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Panel A of Table 3 compares the large loss deals with other deals from 1998 through 2001, as 
17:428:37746:26:25:90:524:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:well as with all deals from 1980-1997. Not surprisingly, large loss deals have a large transaction 
17:429:37845:25:25:90:524:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:value compared to other deals, but there is nothing noticeable about the size of these deals when it 
17:430:37946:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is  normalized  by  firm  market  value.  Equity  is  used  more  often  with  large  loss  deals  than  with  
17:431:38057:25:26:90:524:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:other deals and cash is used less often, which contributes to the low abnormal returns of large loss 
17:432:38158:26:25:90:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals. Large loss deals are more likely to be hostile and more likely to be tender offers than other 
17:433:38259:25:25:90:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:transactions,  but  the  fraction  of  large  loss  deals  that  are  tender  offers  or  hostile  is  small  enough  
17:434:38377:25:26:90:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that  these  deal  characteristics  cannot  explain  the  large  loss  deals.  The  acquisitions  in  our  large  
17:435:38491:26:25:90:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss deal sample are more likely to be within the acquirer’s industry than the other acquisitions, 
17:436:38590:25:25:90:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:but  the  difference  is  not  significant.  The  large  loss  deals  cannot  be  attributed  to  diversification  
17:437:38705:25:26:90:135:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:attempts.  
17:438:38716:26:25:107:525:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We find next that large loss deals are overwhelmingly acquisitions of public firms compared 
17:439:38808:25:25:89:527:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  sample  as  a  whole.  While  48.3%  of  the  acquisitions  from  1998  through  2001  are  
17:440:38909:25:26:89:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions of private firms, 75.9% of the large loss deals are acquisitions of public firms, which 
17:441:39010:26:25:89:526:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are  acquisitions  with  lower  abnormal  returns.  Mitchell,  Pulvino,  and  Stafford  (2003)  show  that  
17:442:39118:25:25:89:525:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:there is price pressure from the trades of arbitrageurs with acquisitions of public firms for equity. 
17:443:39220:25:0:89:528:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This  effect  would  predict  a  rebound  in  the  price  of  the  acquirer  following  the  acquisition  
18:444:39329:0:25:90:528:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcement.  Though  we  do  not  reproduce  the  results  in  a  table,  we  examine  how  the  
18:445:39428:25:25:90:527:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cumulative  abnormal  returns  evolve  after  the  announcement  date.  The  cumulative  abnormal  
18:446:39527:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return  is  −10.5%  at  day  +10  and  −15.0%  at  day  +60,  so  there  is  no  indication  that  there  is  a  
18:447:39640:26:25:89:408:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant transitory component to the announcement abnormal return.  
18:448:39711:25:25:107:527:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:More  competition  could  explain  the  large  loss  deals.  We  use  two  variables  to  measure  
18:449:39810:25:25:89:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:competition. The first variable is the percentage of deals with actual competition. The large loss 
18:450:39909:25:26:89:525:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals have a higher fraction of such deals, but this fraction is small so it cannot explain the large 
18:451:40011:26:25:89:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  deal  sample.  The  second  measure  is  the  liquidity  index  used  by  Schlingemann,  Stulz,  and  
18:452:40119:25:25:89:524:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Walkling (2002). This index measures the intensity of mergers and acquisitions activity within an 
18:453:40217:25:26:89:524:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:industry. With that measure, the large loss deals seem to take place in industries with slightly less 
18:454:40319:26:25:89:219:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:activity than the other deals.  
18:455:40351:25:25:107:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In Panel B of Table 3, we report characteristics for the firms in our sample of large loss deals 
18:456:40448:25:25:89:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and the firms that make other acquisitions. Not surprisingly, firms that make large loss deals are 
18:457:40547:25:26:89:526:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:big.  The  large  loss  deal  firms  do  not  have  more  cash  than  other  firms,  but  they  have  lower  
18:458:40656:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:leverage when leverage is measured using the market value of the firm’s assets. We find that the 
18:459:40753:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Tobin’s q of acquiring firms in our large loss deal sample is significantly higher than the Tobin’s 
18:460:40853:25:26:89:525:305:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:q  of  the  other  acquiring  firms.  A  striking  way  to  see  this  is  to  note  that  only  18  firms  making  a  
18:461:40972:26:25:89:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deal have a q lower than the median q of all acquirers in the same year. Large loss deal 
18:462:41072:25:25:89:526:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms  have  a  significantly  higher  industry-adjusted  q,  which  is  the  firm’s  q  minus  the  median  
18:463:41181:25:26:89:525:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:industry q when the industry is defined using the 4-digit SIC code, than other acquirers. Dong et

18:465:41376:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ratio of firms when they announce a large loss deal is less than half what it is for the other firms 
18:466:41477:25:26:89:526:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in  our  sample  and  only  14  firms  announcing  large  loss  deals  have  a  BM  ratio  higher  than  the  
18:467:41587:26:25:89:527:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:median  BM  ratio  of  acquirers  in  the  same  year.  Finally,  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  
18:468:41696:25:25:89:525:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:operating cash flow to assets when using the mean, but there is none using the median. Large loss 
18:469:41794:25:0:89:327:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deal firms have somewhat lower operating cash flow. 
19:470:41849:0:25:107:526:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:These  comparisons  between  large  loss  deals  and  other  acquisitions  show  that  some  of  the  
19:471:41951:25:25:90:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:empirical regularities of the 1980s make the large loss deals even more puzzling: the firms have 
19:472:42048:25:26:90:534:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:higher q’s,   lower   cash   holdings,   and   lower   operating   cash   flow   than   other   firms.      
19:473:42156:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Competition and hostility seem to affect few large loss deals. However, most large loss deals are 
19:474:42254:25:25:90:428:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:public firm acquisitions with a large equity component in the consideration.

19:478:42480:25:25:107:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We investigate whether regression models of the type used in the literature to analyze bidder 
19:479:42574:25:26:90:526:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  returns  help  predict  the  losses  associated  with  the  large  loss  deals.  We  estimate  these  
19:480:42686:26:25:90:524:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regression models over the period from 1980 through 1997 and use the estimates to obtain fitted 
19:481:42782:25:25:90:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  returns  for  the  large  loss  deals  from  1998  through  2001.  The  first  four  regressions  in  
19:482:42894:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Table 4 use the whole sample. Neither the coefficient on Tobin’s q nor the coefficient on BM are 
19:483:42991:25:26:90:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant. In models (1) and (2), the coefficient on the market value of leverage is positive and 
19:484:43091:26:25:90:526:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant,  indicating  that  firms  with  higher  leverage  have  higher  announcement  returns.  The  
19:485:43197:25:25:90:526:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity  index  in  models  (3)  and  (4)  is  negative  and  significant,  showing  that  acquisitions  of  
19:486:43308:25:26:90:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms  that  are  in  more  liquid  industries  have  worse  abnormal  returns.  Finally,  the  coefficient  on

19:489:43628:25:26:89:515:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals are close to zero, so that the unexplained abnormal return using these regressions is large.  
19:490:43728:26:25:107:527:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The  regressions  estimated  so  far  do  not  include  the  bidder  premium  as  an  independent  
19:491:43827:25:25:89:526:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:variable  since  premium  data  is  only  available  for  public  firm  acquisitions.  It  could  be  that  the  
19:492:43940:25:26:89:526:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large  loss  deals  are  due  to  overpayment.  To  examine  this,  we  compute  a  percentage  premium  
19:493:44045:26:25:89:524:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:using the stock price 50 days before the offer similar to Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2003). 
19:494:44144:25:25:89:527:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We  estimate  regressions  predicting  the  premium  offered  using  each  of  the  four  premium  
19:495:44243:25:0:89:525:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measures (not reported). The regressions offer little evidence that the premium is higher in large 
20:496:44345:0:25:90:526:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  deals.  In  regressions  predicting  the  premium,  similar  to  those  used  by  Officer  (2003)  and  
20:497:44455:25:25:90:524:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Schwert (2000), we find that a dummy variable for large loss deals is insignificant with three out 
20:498:44554:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of  four  premium  measures.  The  problem  may  be  that  the  premium  data  is  too  noisy.  In  most  
20:499:44660:26:25:90:526:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regressions,  the  coefficient  on  the  large  loss  deal  dummy  is  economically  significant,  typically  
20:500:44770:25:25:90:286:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:indicating a higher premium of 8% to 10%.  
20:501:44812:25:25:107:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Regressions (5) and (6) in Table 4 are estimated only for the acquisitions for which we have 
20:502:44905:25:26:89:524:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:premium information. In these regressions, we use the component premium since it is available at 
20:503:45002:26:25:89:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the time the abnormal returns are estimated and since the sample is substantially larger with that 
20:504:45101:25:25:89:526:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measure  than  with  the  initial  price  measure.  The  coefficient  on  the  premium  is  insignificant  in  
20:505:45212:25:26:89:524:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:both regressions. The same result holds if we use the initial price measure. These regressions also 
20:506:45312:26:25:89:397:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:produce fitted abnormal returns close to zero for the large loss deals.

20:510:45517:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  returns  is  that  these  deals  are  explained  by  unique  characteristics  of  the  period  from  
20:511:45628:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:1998 through 2001. The late 1990s are a period with unusually high equity valuations. A number 
20:512:45723:25:26:89:524:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of recent papers analyze theoretically and empirically the relation between equity valuations, the

20:514:45930:25:25:89:524:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Richardson and Teoh (2003) show that high valuation firms are more likely to make acquisitions 
20:515:46025:25:26:89:525:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and  exhibit  worse  abnormal  returns.7  Shleifer  and  Vishny  (2003)  build  a  model  where  it  can  be  
20:516:46135:26:25:89:526:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:advantageous  for  an  overvalued  bidder  to  make  acquisitions  to  lock  in  real  assets  and  Jensen  
20:517:46243:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(2003) argues that overvaluation leads to high costs of managerial discretion, enabling managers

21:522:46588:0:25:107:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The  multivariate  regressions  in  Table  4  are  inconsistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  there  is  an  
21:523:46697:25:25:90:527:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:economically  important  negative  relation  between  valuation  and  abnormal  returns  from  1980

21:525:46890:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we re-estimate these regressions from 1980 through 2001, we find that Tobin’s q has a significant 
21:526:46988:25:25:90:526:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:negative  coefficient  of  -0.0046  (p-value  of  0.044)  in  contrast  to  the  earlier  literature  and  the  
21:527:47100:25:25:90:526:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient  on  BM  increases  also  substantially  (though  it  is  still  not  significant).  Since  the  large  
21:528:47216:25:26:90:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  deal  firms  have  such  a  high  Tobin’s  q,  the  Tobin’s  q  (evaluated  at  the  mean)  between  the  
21:529:47328:26:25:89:524:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deal firms and the whole sample of acquirers corresponds to an abnormal return change 
21:530:47425:25:25:89:527:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of  roughly  –2.5%.  As  a  result,  the  residual  of  the  large  loss  deals  is  much  smaller  in  these  
21:531:47536:25:26:89:527:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regressions.  When  we  estimate  regression  (6)  over  the  period  from  1980  through  2001  the  
21:532:47638:26:25:89:428:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:average residual of the large loss deals becomes –5.35% instead of –8.07%.  
21:533:47714:25:25:107:526:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:It  could  be  that  the  relation  between  abnormal  returns  and  valuation  measures  is  not  linear  
21:534:47821:25:25:89:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and that valuation measures matter in a different way for large firms than for smaller firms. For 
21:535:47919:25:26:89:524:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:instance, it could be that a low BM for a small firm indicates good growth opportunities but a low 
21:536:48018:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:BM  for  a  large  firm  indicates  overvaluation.  We  construct  a  sub-sample  for  the  period  1998  to  
21:537:48128:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:2001 of public firm acquisitions paid for with equity, where the firm is in the top decile of equity 
21:538:48229:25:26:89:525:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:capitalization of firms making acquisitions and where the firm’s BM ratio is in the bottom decile 
21:539:48327:26:25:89:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  BM  ratio  of  firms  making  acquisitions.  The  acquisitions  in  that  sub-sample  that  are  not  
21:540:48438:25:25:89:525:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deals have a positive insignificant abnormal return of 0.86%. Among firms that do not 
21:541:48535:25:26:89:524:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:make a large loss deal we compare those with a BM lower than the average BM of large loss deal 
21:542:48630:26:25:89:526:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms  versus  those  with  a  higher  BM  and  find  lower  BM  firms  do  not  have  worse  abnormal  
21:543:48734:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns,  whether  we  look  at  all  acquisitions  or  only  at  acquisitions  of  public  firms  paid  for  with  
21:544:48850:25:26:89:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:equity.  The  explanation  for  the  large  loss  deals  cannot  therefore  simply  be  that  these  firms  are  
21:545:48963:26:25:89:204:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large firms with low BM. 
21:546:48988:25:25:107:525:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To see whether the large loss deal firms make a large loss deal when their valuation is high, 
21:547:49082:25:0:89:525:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we  compute  Tobin’s  q  and  the  BM  ratio  for  each  year  those  firms  announce  an  acquisition.  We  
22:548:49194:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:then compute the mean and median of the ratio of the Tobin’s q in the year of the large loss deal 
22:549:49292:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and  of  the  Tobin’s  q  average  across  all  acquisition  years.  We  call  this  q  ratio  minus  one  the  
22:550:49404:25:26:90:526:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:normalized q  ratio.  We  would  expect  the  normalized  q  ratio  to  be  zero  if  there  is  no  relation  
22:551:49515:26:26:90:525:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:between valuation and large loss deals. The mean ratio is 2.71 (0.46 for the median). If we use the 
22:552:49615:26:26:90:524:607:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:BM ratio instead to construct a normalized BM ratio, we get −0.10 (−0.08 for the median). Out of 
22:553:49712:26:25:89:524:581:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:76 firms, 19 firms have their highest Tobin’s q in the year of the large loss deal and 29 have it the 
22:554:49814:25:25:89:525:556:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:year  before.    Similar  results  are  obtained  with  the  BM  ratio.  Strikingly,  among  large  loss  deals,  
22:555:49928:25:26:89:524:531:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the magnitude of the loss is positively correlated with the valuation of the acquirer. We estimate a 
22:556:50029:26:25:89:526:505:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:logistic  regression  (not  reported)  using  all  acquisitions  made  by  the  firms  in  our  large  loss  deal  
22:557:50144:25:25:89:526:480:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sample.  The  dependent  variable  takes  value  1  for  the  large  loss  deals,  while  the  independent  
22:558:50252:25:26:89:525:455:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:variables are a constant and a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if a firm is at its valuation 
22:559:50352:26:25:89:524:429:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:peak in the year of the acquisition. The coefficient estimate on the dummy variable is significant 
22:560:50451:25:25:89:526:404:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and  positive  at  the  1%  level  when  we  use  Tobin’s  q  and  negative  and  significant  when  we  use  
22:561:50561:25:25:89:114:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:BM.  
22:562:50566:25:26:107:525:354:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The firms that make the large loss deals are serial acquirers. This makes it unlikely the large 
22:563:50662:26:25:89:526:328:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss  deal  signals  that  a  firm  has  run  out  of  internal  growth  opportunities  as  in  the  models  of  
22:564:50775:25:25:89:526:303:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:McCardle  and  Viswanatan  (1994)  and  Jovanovic  and  Braguinsky  (2002).,  but  it  is  plausible  it  
22:565:50881:25:26:89:525:278:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:signals that the firm has run out of profitable acquisitions. If firms make poor acquisitions when 
22:566:50980:26:25:89:524:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:they are overvalued, then acquisitions around the time a firm makes a large loss deal should have 
22:567:51078:25:25:89:524:227:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:poor abnormal returns also. In Panel A of Table 5, we show the abnormal returns associated with 
22:568:51174:25:26:89:526:202:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the  other  acquisitions  by  the  firms  making  the  large  loss  deals  for  the  24  months  before  their  
22:569:51286:26:25:89:525:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(first) large loss deal from 1998 through 2001 and for the 24 months afterwards for sub-samples 
22:570:51382:25:25:89:527:151:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:based  on  the  organizational  form  of  the  assets  acquired  and  the  mode  of  financing  of  the  
22:571:51487:25:25:89:526:126:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition.  We  find  that  for  the  two  years  before  the  large  loss  deal,  the  firms  create  value  
22:572:51599:25:26:89:525:101:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:through  acquisitions  for  a  total  of  $20  billion,  which  seems  inconsistent  with  the  view  that  high  
22:573:51713:26:0:89:525:75:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:valuation  firms  make  poor  acquisitions.  Before  the  announcement  of  their  large  loss  deal,  these  
23:574:51826:0:25:90:526:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms  create  value  in  total  for  each  type  of  acquisition.  In  the  year  before  the  large  loss  deal  
23:575:51941:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcement,  26  firms  make  an  economically  significant  acquisition  and  the  mean  abnormal  
23:576:52043:25:26:90:524:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return is 2%. Many of these acquisitions are paid for with equity, which makes it unreasonable to 
23:577:52141:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:believe that somehow the large loss deals have low abnormal returns simply because they involve 
23:578:52237:25:25:90:525:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:an equity issue. However, the large loss deal is a watershed event. In the two years after the large 
23:579:52338:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss deal, announcements of acquisitions are associated with a reduction in shareholder wealth of 
23:580:52436:25:26:90:527:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$110  billion.  The  year  after  the  large  loss  deal,  18  firms  make  an  economically  significant  
23:581:52543:26:25:90:416:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition and the mean abnormal return, –3.27%, is significantly lower. 
23:582:52617:25:25:107:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:If  the  acquisition  announcement  is  explained  partly  by  negative  synergies,  it  should  be  that  
23:583:52724:25:26:90:525:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements  of  failed  offers  with  large  dollar  losses  are  followed  by  positive  announcement  
23:584:52831:26:25:90:526:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns  when  the  offer  is  withdrawn.  We  searched  for  acquisition  announcements  with  dollar  
23:585:52935:25:25:90:527:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:losses  in  excess  of  $1  billion  that  are  subsequently  withdrawn.  There  are  very  few  of  these.  
23:586:53044:25:25:90:525:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:However,  we  investigate  the  abnormal  return  at  the  announcement  of  the  withdrawal  for  the  six  
23:587:53153:25:26:90:526:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cases  we  could  find.  Using  the  time-series  volatility  to  estimate  significance  of  the  individual  
23:588:53264:26:25:90:527:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements,  we  find  two  announcements  with  significant  positive  abnormal  returns  of  a  
23:589:53365:25:25:90:526:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude  similar  to  the  announcement  of  the  acquisition  attempt,  three  announcements  with  
23:590:53468:25:26:90:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:insignificant  abnormal  returns  to  zero,  and  one  announcement  with  a  large  significant  negative  
23:591:53576:26:25:90:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:abnormal  return.  The  significant  positive  abnormal  returns  are  consistent  with  the  view  that  the  
23:592:53687:25:25:90:530:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition   itself   destroys   wealth;   the   insignificant   abnormal   returns,   assuming   that   the   
23:593:53799:25:26:90:526:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:withdrawal  is  unexpected,  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  acquisition  abnormal  return  is  due  to  
23:594:53911:26:25:90:524:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:information revealed about the acquirer rather than the acquisition itself. We also investigate the 
23:595:54011:25:25:90:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:three cases where a competitor makes an offer following a large loss deal announcement. In the 
23:596:54106:25:26:90:526:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:three  cases,  the  large  loss  deal  firm  experiences  a  positive  abnormal  return,  which  is  consistent  
23:597:54219:26:25:90:525:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with  the  hypothesis  that  the  large  loss  deal  has  negative  synergy.  The  average  of  the  large  loss  
23:598:54333:25:25:90:528:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deal  firm  abnormal  returns  when  the  competing  bid  is  announced  is  2.24%,  but  it  is  not  
23:599:54436:25:0:90:148:77:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant.

24:601:54454:25:25:90:409:684:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:C:7. The long-run performance of firms announcing a large loss deal.  
24:602:54522:25:26:107:524:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The extremely high Tobin’s q and low BM of the firms that announce large loss deals seem to 
24:603:54614:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:explain part of the abnormal return associated with the large loss deals, yet at the same time firms 
24:604:54715:25:25:90:524:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with equally lofty valuations – including the large loss deal firms before they make these deals – 
24:605:54814:25:25:89:527:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:do  not  have  poor  abnormal  returns  when  they  announce  acquisitions.  It  seems  sensible  to  
24:606:54916:25:26:89:526:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:conclude  that  the  large  loss  deal  firms  through  their  announcement  provide  information  to  the  
24:607:55024:26:25:89:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:market that their valuation is not justified and that earlier announcements did not provide similar 
24:608:55124:25:25:89:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:information.  Such  an  outcome  could  result  from  the  acquisition  destroying  wealth  or  from  the  
24:609:55231:25:26:89:525:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:market inferring from the information conveyed by the firm that the stand-alone value of the firm 
24:610:55329:26:25:89:525:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is less than previously thought. Alternatively, the market could just have overreacted to the large 
24:611:55429:25:25:89:525:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss deal announcements. Overreaction should lead to high subsequent returns, but overvaluation, 
24:612:55526:25:25:89:526:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  extent  that  it  is  not  corrected  completely  by  the  market’s  reaction  to  the  announcement,  
24:613:55638:25:26:89:267:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:should lead to poor subsequent returns.  
24:614:55679:26:25:107:524:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 4 presents buy-and-hold returns over the period 1998-2002 for various portfolios. The 
24:615:55772:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deal portfolio is an equally-weighted portfolio of firms that announce a large loss deal 
24:616:55872:25:26:89:526:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:after  January  1,  1998.  Whenever  a  firm  announces  a  large  loss  deal  in  a  given  month,  the  
24:617:55978:26:25:89:527:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio  is  rebalanced  the  following  month  to  include  that  firm.  Consequently,  the  portfolio  
24:618:56085:25:25:89:527:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return  corresponds  to  what  an  investor  would  have  earned  by  investing  in  firms  after  they  
24:619:56190:25:26:89:524:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announced large loss deals and held that portfolio until the end of 2002. From the graph it can be 
24:620:56289:26:27:89:525:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:seen that the portfolio has a return of approximately −53% measured from January 1998 through 
24:621:56383:27:26:89:524:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the end of 2002. In contrast, an investment in the monthly CRSP value-weighted index results in 
24:622:56479:26:26:89:229:150:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a buy-and-hold return of −5%.  
24:623:56510:26:25:107:525:124:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We  also  construct  for  each  firm  in  our  large  loss  deal  sample  an  industry  and  size  matched  
24:624:56618:25:0:89:521:99:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio.  Each  portfolio  consists  of  firms  with  the  same  4-digit  SIC  code  and  the  same  NYSE-
25:625:56729:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:based  size  quartile  as  our  sample  firm.  In  cases  where  there  are  fewer  than  10  firms  available  
25:626:56841:25:25:90:526:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:within  a  4-digit  SIC  code,  we  use  2-digit  SIC  codes  instead.  The  matching  firms  exclude  firms  
25:627:56951:25:26:90:522:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that made a large loss deal in the 12 months preceding the portfolio formation date. The buy-and-
25:628:57048:26:26:90:319:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hold return of the matching-firm portfolio is −14%. 
25:629:57100:26:26:107:524:607:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We construct a portfolio that follows the strategy of buying a large loss deal firm’s matching 
25:630:57195:26:25:90:524:581:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio when that large loss deal firm is added to the portfolio of large loss deals. The portfolio 
25:631:57297:25:25:90:529:556:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is  an  equally-weighted  portfolio  of  each  matching-firm  portfolio  for  the  firms  that  have  
25:632:57399:25:26:90:527:531:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announced  a  large  loss  deal  since  January  1,  1998  up  to  the  month  the  portfolio  return  is  
25:633:57506:26:26:90:525:505:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:computed.  The  excess  return  of  the  large  loss  deal  portfolio  over  the  matching-firm  portfolio  is  
25:634:57618:26:26:90:123:479:121:g_d0_f5:121:g_d0_f3:B:−39%.  
25:635:57625:26:25:107:525:453:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally,  we  estimate  a  regression  of  the  monthly  return  of  a  long  position  in  the  large  loss  
25:636:57735:25:26:90:524:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deal  portfolio  and  a  short  position  in  the  matching-firm  portfolio  on  the  Fama-French  factors.9 
25:637:57843:26:27:89:526:402:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:This  investment  strategy  has  a  significant  intercept  of  −0.85%  (p-value=0.022).  If  we  add  the  
25:638:57951:27:26:89:522:375:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Carhart  (1997)  momentum  factor  to  the  regression,  the  estimate  of  the  intercept  is  −0.77%  (p-
25:639:58058:26:26:89:526:349:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:value=0.041).  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  view  that  the  large  loss  deal  firms  were  
25:640:58166:26:25:89:527:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:overvalued  and  this  overvaluation  was  corrected  over  time,  but  one  has  to  be  cautious  in  
25:641:58270:25:25:89:405:298:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:interpreting the results since they correspond to one historical episode.  
25:642:58345:25:26:125:128:273:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f4:A:  
25:643:58345:26:25:89:158:247:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:C:8. Conclusion. 
25:644:58360:25:25:107:527:222:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We  find  that  acquisition  announcements  in  the  1990s  are  profitable  in  the  aggregate  for  
25:645:58462:25:25:89:526:197:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring-firm  shareholders  until  1997,  but  the  losses  of  acquiring-firm  shareholders  from  1998  
25:646:58570:25:26:89:525:172:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:through 2001 wiped out all the gains made earlier, so that acquisition announcements in the latest 
25:647:58669:26:25:89:526:146:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:merger  wave  are  costly  for  acquiring-firm  shareholders.  The  losses  result  from  relatively  few  
25:648:58776:25:0:89:526:121:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  fact  that  from  1998  through  2001  the  equally-weighted  
26:649:58886:0:25:90:527:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:average  abnormal  return  associated  with  acquisition  announcements  is  positive.  Without  the  
26:650:58988:25:25:90:525:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  that  lost  $1  billion  or  more  for  their  shareholders  in  our  sample,  i.e.,  excluding  just  
26:651:59105:25:26:90:529:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:over   2%   of   the   observations,   shareholder   wealth   would   have   increased   with   acquisition   
26:652:59215:26:25:90:525:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:announcements. Looking at the aggregate performance of acquisitions, the economic relevance of 
26:653:59310:25:25:90:527:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions  with  large  losses  overwhelms  the  economic  relevance  of  the  thousands  of  other  
26:654:59414:25:25:90:525:583:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:acquisitions. It is therefore important to understand why the announcement of these acquisitions 
26:655:59511:25:26:90:525:558:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is associated with such large wealth losses. We investigate whether the results for the large loss 
26:656:59610:26:25:90:525:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:deals  are  reliable  and  provide  evidence  supportive  that  they  are.  However,  the  aggregate  dollar  
26:657:59720:25:25:90:525:507:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:loss of acquiring-firm shareholders depends on relatively few deals. Though we understand well 
26:658:59815:25:26:90:528:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:how  to  evaluate  abnormal  returns  obtained  by  equally  weighting  observations,  we  do  not  
26:659:59915:26:25:90:526:456:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:understand equally well how to evaluate value-weighted abnormal returns or equivalently dollar

26:661:60029:25:25:107:526:406:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The  firms  that  make  large  loss  deals  are  successful  with  acquisitions  until  they  make  their  
26:662:60136:25:26:89:525:381:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large loss deal. The high valuation of the firms announcing the large loss deals is not sufficient to 
26:663:60238:26:25:89:525:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:explain the change in returns associated with acquisition announcements, since these firms have 
26:664:60334:25:25:89:525:330:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:comparable  valuations  when  they  announce  previous  mergers  or  acquisitions  that  are  associated  
26:665:60440:25:26:89:525:305:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with positive abnormal returns. The wealth losses associated with the acquisition announcements 
26:666:60536:26:25:89:525:279:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are likely caused by a number of reasons. In some cases, management overpays, while in others 
26:667:60630:25:25:89:528:254:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the   transaction   probably   reveals   that   management’s   strategy   is   not   sustainable,   or   more   
26:668:60742:25:26:89:527:229:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specifically  that  the  firm  has  run  out  of  profitable  acquisition  opportunities.  However,  the  
26:669:60848:26:25:89:528:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude  of  the  losses  in  comparison  to  the  consideration  paid  is  large  enough  and  the  
26:670:60951:25:25:89:525:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:performance of the firms after the announcement poor enough that in most cases the acquisitions 
26:671:61047:25:26:89:525:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lead  investors  to  reconsider  the  extremely  high  stand-alone  valuations  of  the  announcing  firms.  
26:672:61156:26:30:89:525:127:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:To the extent that the large loss deal firms are overvalued when they make their announcement, 
26:673:61251:30:7:521:524:97:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:                                                                                                                                                              
26:674:61408:7:16:90:528:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9   The   factor   loadings   are   obtained   from   Kenneth   French’s   website   (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/

27:676:61575:0:25:90:525:709:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their value would fall over time anyway, so the losses that correct the valuation of the acquiring 
27:677:61674:25:25:90:527:684:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:firm  do  not  destroy  shareholder  wealth  for  long-run  shareholders.  Regardless  of  the  precise  
27:678:61779:25:26:90:525:659:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reason that explains the shareholder losses for the acquisitions in our large loss deal sample, the 
27:679:61879:26:25:90:524:633:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:evidence is consistent with managements gaining an unusual amount of discretion because of the 
27:680:61974:25:25:90:526:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:high  valuations  of  their  firms  and  using  that  discretion  in  a  way  that  ends  up  destroying  large
