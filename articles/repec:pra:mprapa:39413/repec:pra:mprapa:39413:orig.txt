2:16:374:27:14:72:511:474:144:Times:144:Times:A large literature suggests that European settlement outside of Europe shaped institutional, 
2:17:467:14:14:72:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:educational, technological, cultural, and economic outcomes. This literature has had a serious 
2:18:562:14:13:72:521:446:144:Times:144:Times:gap: no direct measure of colonial European settlement. In this paper, we (1) construct a new 
2:19:656:13:14:72:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:database on the European share of the population during the early stages of colonization and (2) 
2:20:753:14:14:72:526:419:144:Times:144:Times:examine its impact on the level of economic development today. We find a remarkably strong 
2:21:844:14:14:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:impact of colonial European settlement on development. According to one illustrative exercise, 
2:22:939:14:14:72:536:391:144:Times:144:Times:47 percent of average global development levels today are attributable to Europeans. One of our 
2:23:1035:14:13:72:515:377:144:Times:144:Times:most surprising findings is the positive effect of even a small minority European population 
2:24:1128:13:14:72:540:364:144:Times:144:Times:during the colonial period on per capita income today, contradicting traditional and recent views. 
2:25:1227:14:14:72:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:There is some evidence for an institutional channel, but our findings are most consistent with 
2:26:1322:14:14:72:499:336:144:Times:144:Times:human capital playing a central role in the way that colonial European settlement affects 
2:27:1412:14:14:72:169:322:144:Times:144:Times:development today.

3:42:2330:13:28:72:161:695:144:Times:144:Times:1 Introduction 
3:43:2344:28:27:108:519:667:144:Times:144:Times:Countries have followed remarkably divergent paths of economic development since 
3:44:2425:27:28:72:518:640:144:Times:144:Times:European colonization.  Some former colonies, such as the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, 
3:45:2515:28:27:71:493:612:144:Times:144:Times:Malawi, and Tanzania, have experienced little economic development over the last few 
3:46:2600:27:28:71:518:585:144:Times:144:Times:centuries, with real per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of less than $2 per day.  Other 
3:47:2693:28:28:71:536:557:144:Times:144:Times:former colonies are among the richest countries in the world today, including Australia, Canada, 
3:48:2790:28:27:71:532:529:144:Times:144:Times:and the United States, all of which enjoy real per capita GDP levels of greater than $20,000 per 
3:49:2887:27:28:71:450:502:144:Times:144:Times:annum. Most former colonies fall along the spectrum between these extremes. 
3:50:2962:28:28:107:519:474:144:Times:144:Times:In seeking to explain these divergent paths, influential researchers emphasize that the 
3:51:3050:28:27:71:536:446:144:Times:144:Times:European share of the population during the early stages of colonization shaped national rates of 
3:52:3148:27:28:71:526:419:144:Times:144:Times:economic growth through several mechanisms. First, Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) (ES) and 
3:53:3237:28:27:71:537:391:144:Times:144:Times:Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) (AJR) stress that European colonization had enduring 
3:54:3329:27:28:71:511:364:144:Times:144:Times:effects on political institutions and hence on economic development. They argue that when 
3:55:3419:28:28:71:530:336:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans encountered national resources with lucrative international markets and did not find 
3:56:3514:28:27:71:505:308:144:Times:144:Times:the lands, climate, and disease environment suitable for large-scale settlement, only a few 
3:57:3606:27:28:71:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans tended to settle, and they would create authoritarian political institutions to extract 
3:58:3704:28:27:71:495:253:144:Times:144:Times:and exploit natural resources. The institutions created by Europeans in these “extractive 
3:59:3794:27:28:71:519:226:144:Times:144:Times:colonies” were ultimately harmful to long-run economic development. But, when Europeans 
3:60:3882:28:28:71:530:198:144:Times:144:Times:found lands, climate, and disease environments that were suitable for smaller-scale agriculture, 
3:61:3979:28:27:71:536:170:144:Times:144:Times:they tended to settle, forming “settler colonies.” In such colonies, Europeans formed institutions 
3:62:4078:27:28:71:531:143:144:Times:144:Times:more protective of political and economic rights that fostered long-run economic development. 
3:63:4172:28:27:71:513:115:144:Times:144:Times:From this perspective, a large proportion of Europeans during colonization is a precursor to 
3:64:4265:27:0:71:244:88:144:Times:144:Times:successful economic development.  
4:65:4300:0:28:108:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:Glaesser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2004) (GLLS) emphasize a second 
4:66:4384:28:27:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:mechanism, arguing that the European share of the population during colonization influenced the 
4:67:4480:27:28:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:rate of human capital accumulation and hence comparative economic development. They argue 
4:68:4570:28:28:72:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:that Europeans brought human capital and human capital creating institutions, which are 
4:69:4658:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:essential for economic growth.  Since human capital disseminates slowly over generations, more 
4:70:4753:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans during the early stages of colonization expedited human capital accumulation across 
4:71:4847:28:28:72:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:the entire population, not just among those of European descent. Thus, the proportion of 
4:72:4936:28:27:72:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans during colonization will be positively related to human capital development and 
4:73:5026:27:28:72:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:hence overall economic development today. Moreover and critically, this view predicts that the 
4:74:5121:28:27:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of Europeans during colonization will matter more for current economic development 
4:75:5215:27:28:72:480:433:144:Times:144:Times:than the proportion of the population of European descent today because of the slow 
4:76:5299:28:28:72:231:405:144:Times:144:Times:dissemination of human capital.  
4:77:5331:28:27:108:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:Other researchers, either explicitly or implicitly, highlight the colonial origins of 
4:78:5417:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:comparative economic development. North (1990) argues that the British brought comparatively 
4:79:5510:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:strong political and legal institutions that were more conducive to economic development than 
4:80:5604:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:the institutions brought by other European nations. This view stresses the need for a sufficiently 
4:81:5703:28:28:72:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:strong European presence to instill those institutions, but does not necessarily suggest that the 
4:82:5801:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of Europeans during colonization will affect economic development today beyond 
4:83:5891:27:28:72:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:some initial threshold level. Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009) stress that the degree to which the 
4:84:5986:28:27:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:genetic heritage of a colonial population was similar to that of the economies at the technological 
4:85:6086:27:28:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:frontier positively affected the diffusion of technology and thus economic development, where 
4:86:6180:28:28:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:European migration materially affected the genetic composition of economies. Putterman and 
4:87:6271:28:0:72:520:101:144:Times:144:Times:Weil (2010) emphasize that the experience with statehood and agriculture of the ancestors of 
5:88:6365:0:28:72:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:people currently living within countries help explain cross-country differences in economic 
5:89:6457:28:27:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:success. And, Comin, Easterly, and Gong (2011) likewise find that the ancient technologies of 
5:90:6551:27:28:72:541:654:144:Times:144:Times:the ancestors of populations today help predict per capita income of those populations. In both of 
5:91:6650:28:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:these papers, the ancestral nature of a population helps account for cross-country differences in 
5:92:6748:28:27:71:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:economic development, where European colonization materially shaped the composition of 
5:93:6835:27:28:71:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:national populations. Other papers address the role of Europeans in shaping social capital, civic 
5:94:6933:28:28:71:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:capital, or democratic capital (Luigi Guiso, Paola Sapienza, Luigi Zingales, 2010, Persson, 
5:95:7025:28:27:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:Torsten and Guido Tabellini 2010.) Although these researchers stress alternative mechanisms 
5:96:7117:27:28:71:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:through which European colonization shaped comparative economic development, they all 
5:97:7203:28:27:71:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:emphasize that the nature of European settlements had long run consequences. Although we do 
5:98:7295:27:28:71:530:433:144:Times:144:Times:not examine the specific mechanisms underlying each theory, we do assess the broad, common 
5:99:7386:28:28:71:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:question: What was the impact of European settlement during the colonial period on economic 
5:100:7478:28:27:71:171:377:144:Times:144:Times:development today? 
5:101:7496:27:28:107:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:The purposes of this paper are (1) to construct a new database on the European share of 
5:102:7584:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:the population during the early stages of colonization and (2) to examine its impact on the level 
5:103:7682:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:of economic development today. While a considerable body of research emphasizes the role of 
5:104:7774:28:28:71:533:267:144:Times:144:Times:European colonization on subsequent rates of economic development, what has been missing in 
5:105:7866:28:27:71:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:the empirical literature is the key intermediating variable: colonial European settlement. We 
5:106:7960:27:28:71:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:believe that we are the first to explicitly measure the European share of the population during 
5:107:8056:28:27:71:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:colonization for a broad cross-section of countries and assess its impact on long-run economic 
5:108:8151:27:28:71:114:157:144:Times:144:Times:growth.  
5:109:8160:28:28:107:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:To identify the impact of the European share of the population during colonization on 
5:110:8246:28:0:71:507:101:144:Times:144:Times:economic development today, we compile data on the historical determinants of European 
6:111:8334:0:28:72:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:settlement to use as instrumental variables. We employ a very simple model of the cost and 
6:112:8425:28:27:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:benefits of European settlement to select possible instruments. Some determinants have already 
6:113:8520:27:28:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:been discussed in the literature, such as (1) pre-colonial population density, (2) latitude, and (3) 
6:114:8621:28:28:71:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:the disease environment facing Europeans. Pre-colonial population density raises the costs to 
6:115:8715:28:27:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans of obtaining and securing land for new settlers. Latitude raises the benefits of simply 
6:116:8813:27:28:71:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:transferring European technologies (such as for agriculture) to the newly settled areas.  A harsh 
6:117:8911:28:28:71:501:543:144:Times:144:Times:disease environment facing Europeans obviously raises the expected costs of settlement.  
6:118:9000:28:27:107:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:To this list of common determinants of European settlement, we add one very important 
6:119:9086:27:28:71:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:new variable: indigenous mortality from European diseases. Indigenous mortality from European 
6:120:9180:28:27:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:diseases is a tragic natural experiment that is a very good predictor of European settlement, since 
6:121:9280:27:28:71:510:433:144:Times:144:Times:it removed or weakened indigenous resistance to Europeans invading new lands, and made 
6:122:9367:28:28:71:541:405:144:Times:144:Times:plenty of fertile land available to settlers. The phenomenon is limited to lands that had essentially 
6:123:9469:28:27:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:zero contact with Eurasia for thousands of years, since even a small amount of previous contact 
6:124:9565:27:28:71:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:was enough to share diseases and develop some resistance to them. For example, trans-Sahara 
6:125:9657:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:and trans-Indian Ocean contacts were enough to make Africa part of the Eurasian disease pool 
6:126:9750:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:(McNeil 1976, Karlen 1995, Oldstone 1998). Historical studies and population figures show that 
6:127:9845:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:only the New World (the Americas and Caribbean) and Oceania (including Australia and New 
6:128:9934:28:27:72:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:Zealand) suffered large-scale indigenous mortality due to a lack of resistance to European 
6:129:10025:27:28:72:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:diseases (McEvedy and Jones 1978). Thus, we use measures of the historical determinants of 
6:130:10116:28:27:72:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:European settlement, such as pre-colonial population density and indigenous mortality, to 
6:131:10206:27:28:72:483:157:144:Times:144:Times:identify the impact of colonial European settlement on economic development today. 
6:132:10288:28:28:108:514:129:144:Times:144:Times:We find that the European share of the population during colonization helps explain 
6:133:10372:28:0:72:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:economic development today, with effects of surprisingly large magnitudes. The proportion of 
7:134:10466:0:28:72:498:709:144:Times:144:Times:colonial Europeans is strongly and positively associated with current levels of economic 
7:135:10555:28:27:72:505:681:144:Times:144:Times:development after accounting for (i) British legal heritage, (ii) the percentage of years the 
7:136:10649:27:28:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:country has been independent since 1776, (iii) the ethnic diversity of the current population, and 
7:137:10748:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:(iv) current institutions. Moreover, all of these results hold when using instrumental variables for 
7:138:10849:28:27:72:483:598:144:Times:144:Times:the proportion of Europeans during colonization. The relationship between economic 
7:139:10932:27:28:72:515:571:144:Times:144:Times:development today and the proportion of Europeans during colonization does weaken when 
7:140:11019:28:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for a measure of current human capital, which is consistent with the view that human 
7:141:11116:28:27:72:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:capital was a key intermediating channel through which colonial settlement shaped current levels 
7:142:11213:27:28:72:203:488:144:Times:144:Times:of economic development. 
7:143:11238:28:27:108:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:Another important result is that the European share of the population during the early 
7:144:11325:27:28:72:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:stages of colonization is more strongly associated with economic development today than the 
7:145:11417:28:28:72:483:405:144:Times:144:Times:percentage of the population today that is of European descent. Europeans during the 
7:146:11502:28:27:72:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:colonization era seem to matter more for economic development today than Europeans today. 
7:147:11592:27:28:72:470:350:144:Times:144:Times:This finding is consistent with the view that Europeans brought growth-promoting 
7:148:11673:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics—such as institutions, human capital, connections with international markets, and 
7:149:11770:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:cultural norms—that diffused to the rest of the population over generations. This result de-
7:150:11862:28:28:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:emphasizes the importance of Europeans per se and instead emphasizes the impact of what 
7:151:11950:28:27:72:332:239:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans brought to economies during colonization. 
7:152:12002:27:28:108:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:Perhaps the most novel result is that the positive marginal impact of the European share 
7:153:12091:28:27:72:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:of the population during colonization on economic development today becomes larger—not 
7:154:12178:27:28:72:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:smaller or negative—when examining only former colonies with very few European settlers. ES 
7:155:12270:28:28:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:and AJR stress that a small proportion of Europeans during colonization harmed development by 
7:156:12364:28:0:72:503:101:144:Times:144:Times:establishing extractive institutions, but a large settlement of Europeans spurred economic 
8:157:12456:0:28:72:537:709:144:Times:144:Times:development by creating egalitarian institutions. Thus, creating a small European settlement in a 
8:158:12554:28:27:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:region with no Europeans could actually curtail economic development by encouraging the 
8:159:12642:27:28:72:531:654:144:Times:144:Times:establishment of extractive institutions (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). To assess these views, 
8:160:12736:28:28:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:we examine only economies with a small proportion of Europeans during the colonial period, 
8:161:12827:28:27:72:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:which we define as economies with less than 15 percent Europeans, including those that had 
8:162:12918:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:essentially zero Europeans.  Even among these countries, more Europeans during colonization 
8:163:13010:28:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:are associated with greater economic development today; indeed, the estimated coefficient on the 
8:164:13107:28:27:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:European share of the colonial population increases in size in this subsample of countries. Thus, 
8:165:13205:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:the positive relationship between Europeans and economic development today is not just about 
8:166:13298:28:27:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:the difference between settler and extractive colonies. We do not confirm the prediction that 
8:167:13392:27:28:72:536:433:144:Times:144:Times:colonies with essentially no Europeans performed better than (or even as well as) those colonies 
8:168:13489:28:28:72:237:405:144:Times:144:Times:with a small group of Europeans.  
8:169:13522:28:27:108:489:377:144:Times:144:Times:Ample qualifications temper our conclusions. First, we do not identify a single 
8:170:13602:27:28:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:mechanism through which the European share of the population during colonization shaped 
8:171:13690:28:27:72:510:322:144:Times:144:Times:long-run economic development. We show that European share is strongly associated with 
8:172:13777:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:human capital and democratic political institutions today, but we do not trace the impact of 
8:173:13870:28:28:72:501:267:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans on human capital and political institutions over time, nor do we exclude other 
8:174:13959:28:27:72:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:potential mechanisms through which the European share of the population during colonization 
8:175:14051:27:28:72:271:212:144:Times:144:Times:might influence economic development.  
8:176:14089:28:27:108:499:184:144:Times:144:Times:Second, we do not assess the welfare implications of European settlement during 
8:177:14169:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:colonization; we only assess the income effect under conditions where welfare and income are 
8:178:14262:28:28:72:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:clearly not identical. Europeans often cruelly oppressed indigenous populations, as well as the 
8:179:14358:28:0:72:538:101:144:Times:144:Times:people that they brought as slaves (see Acemoglu and Robinson 2012 for compelling examples). 
9:180:14452:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, GDP per capita today cannot measure the welfare effects of European settlement; it can 
9:181:14545:28:27:72:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:only measure economic activity within a particular geographical area. Although there is no 
9:182:14636:27:28:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:question about European oppression, the effect of European colonization on long-run economic 
9:183:14729:28:28:71:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:development remains an open question. In this paper, we examine the relationship between 
9:184:14818:28:27:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:European settlement during the colonial period and economic development today to help inform 
9:185:14911:27:28:71:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:debates about the sources of the divergent paths of economic development taken by countries 
9:186:15003:28:28:71:280:543:144:Times:144:Times:around the world since the colonial period. 
9:187:15046:28:27:107:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 1 defines and discusses the 
9:188:15135:27:28:71:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:data, while Section 2 provides preliminary evidence on the determinants of human settlement 
9:189:15227:28:27:71:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:prior to European colonization and the factors shaping European settlement.  Section 3 presents 
9:190:15323:27:28:71:501:433:144:Times:144:Times:the paper’s core results on the effect of colonial European share, considering the controls 
9:191:15415:28:28:71:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:mentioned above. Section 4 reports an exercise in development accounting to calculate what 
9:192:15506:28:27:71:470:377:144:Times:144:Times:share of global development can be attributed to Europeans. Section 5 concludes.   
9:193:15589:27:0:107:110:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:194:15590:0:27:72:117:708:144:Times:144:Times:1. Data 
10:195:15596:27:27:108:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:To assess the independent impact of the European share of the population during the 
10:196:15680:27:28:72:541:654:144:Times:144:Times:early stages of colonization on the level of economic development today, we need data on (1) the 
10:197:15777:28:28:72:495:626:144:Times:144:Times:European share of the population during colonization, (2) instrumental variables for the 
10:198:15866:28:27:72:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:European share of the population to mitigate potential biases associated with measurement error 
10:199:15962:27:28:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:and reverse causality, (3) other exogenous determinants of economic development, so that we 
10:200:16054:28:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:can isolate the independent association between the European share of the population during 
10:201:16146:28:27:72:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:colonization and economic development, and (4) measures of economic development today.  
10:202:16233:27:28:108:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:This section describes only the two data series that we construct: (1) the European share 
10:203:16323:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:of the population during colonization and (2) the degree to which a region experienced large 
10:204:16416:27:28:72:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:scale indigenous mortality due to the diseases brought by European explorers in the 15th and 16th 
10:205:16513:28:28:71:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:centuries. Since the other data that we employ in our analyses are taken from readily available 
10:206:16609:28:27:71:418:377:144:Times:144:Times:sources, we define those variables when we present the analyses below. 
10:207:16679:27:28:107:110:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:208:16679:28:27:107:203:322:144:Times:144:Times:1.1 Euro share  
10:209:16694:27:28:107:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:We compile data on the European share of the population during the early stages of 
10:210:16777:28:28:71:525:267:144:Times:144:Times:colonization (Euro share) from several sources. Since colonial administrators were concerned 
10:211:16870:28:27:71:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:about documenting the size and composition of colonial populations, there are abundant—albeit 
10:212:16964:27:28:71:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:disparate—sources of data. Of course, there was hardly anything like a modern statistical service 
10:213:17062:28:27:71:509:184:144:Times:144:Times:in colonial times, so that different administrators across different colonies in different time 
10:214:17158:27:28:71:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:periods used different and often undocumented methods for assembling population statistics. 
10:215:17250:28:28:71:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, we use a large variety of primary and secondary sources on colonial history to piece 
10:216:17341:28:0:71:334:101:144:Times:144:Times:together data on the European share of the population. 
11:217:17397:0:28:108:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:Although the Data Appendix provides detailed information on our sources, the years for 
11:218:17484:28:27:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:which we compiled data on each country, and discussions about the quality of the data, it is 
11:219:17577:27:28:72:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:worth emphasizing a few points here. First, we face the tricky issue of choosing a date to 
11:220:17668:28:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:measure European share.  We would like a date as early as possible after initial European contact 
11:221:17766:28:27:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:to use European settlement as an initial condition affecting subsequent developments. At the 
11:222:17859:27:28:72:532:571:144:Times:144:Times:same time, we do not want to pick a date that is too early after European contact since it is only 
11:223:17958:28:28:72:492:543:144:Times:144:Times:after some process of conquest, disease control, and building of a rudimentary colonial 
11:224:18046:28:27:72:480:515:144:Times:144:Times:infrastructure that it became possible to speak of a European settlement. Given these 
11:225:18132:27:28:72:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:considerations, we try to choose a date at least a century after initial European contact, but at 
11:226:18230:28:27:72:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:least 50 years before independence, which means that for conceptual reasons we do not seek to 
11:227:18324:27:28:72:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:use a uniform date across all colonies.  Given these broad objectives for choosing a date, we 
11:228:18418:28:28:72:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:must nevertheless select dates under severe data limitations. In particular, we do not have a 
11:229:18512:28:27:72:474:377:144:Times:144:Times:continuous time series for each country; rather, the data reflect dates when colonial 
11:230:18598:27:28:72:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:administrators in particular locals happened to measure or estimate populations. The Data 
11:231:18688:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix provides the precise dates for each country and notes that the results are robust to 
11:232:18782:27:28:72:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:using other methods for selecting a particular date for the European share of the population 
11:233:18875:28:28:72:172:267:144:Times:144:Times:during colonization. 
11:234:18896:28:27:108:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:Second, we adopt a “dog did not bark” strategy for recording zero European settlement. If 
11:235:18986:27:28:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:we find no historical sources documenting any European settlement in a particular colony, we 
11:236:19079:28:27:72:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:assume that there were no such settlers. This procedure runs the risk of biasing downward 
11:237:19169:27:28:72:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:European settlement. However, we believe colonial histories (which are virtually all written by 
11:238:19265:28:0:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:European historians) are extremely unlikely to fail to mention significant European settlements. 
12:239:19364:0:28:72:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:We checked and confirmed the validity of this procedure using the Acemoglu et al. (2001) data 
12:240:19458:28:27:72:425:681:144:Times:144:Times:appendix, which gives the share of Europeans in the population in 1900.  
12:241:19531:27:28:108:111:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
12:242:19531:28:28:108:247:626:144:Times:144:Times:1.2 Indigenous mortality 
12:243:19554:28:27:108:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:As instruments for European share of the population during the colonial period, we use 
12:244:19641:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:several predetermined factors—including the degree to which Europeans brought diseases that 
12:245:19733:28:28:72:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:wiped out the indigenous population. Others have carefully documented this tragic experience, 
12:246:19827:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:but we believe that we are the first to use it to explain the nature of colonization and its effect on 
12:247:19930:27:28:72:249:488:144:Times:144:Times:subsequent economic development.  
12:248:19964:28:27:108:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:Although Europeans established at least a minimal level of contact with virtually all 
12:249:20050:27:28:72:534:433:144:Times:144:Times:populations in the world during the colonial period, this contact had truly devastating effects on 
12:250:20149:28:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:indigenous populations in some regions of the world but not in others. Some regions had been 
12:251:20242:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:completely isolated from Eurasia for thousands of years, and thus had no previous exposure or 
12:252:20336:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:resistance to Eurasian diseases. When Europeans then made contact with these populations—
12:253:20425:28:27:72:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:which typically occurred during the initial stages of global European exploration and hence long 
12:254:20522:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:before anything resembling “European settlements,” European diseases such as smallpox and 
12:255:20612:28:28:72:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:measles spread quickly through the indigenous population, decimating the indigenous people. 
12:256:20704:28:27:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:For example, when the Pilgrims arrived in New England in 1620, they found the indigenous 
12:257:20793:27:28:72:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:population already very sparse because European fisherman had occasionally landed along the 
12:258:20885:28:27:72:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:coast of New England in the previous decades. Similarly, De Soto’s expedition through the 
12:259:20975:27:28:72:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:American South in 1542 spread smallpox and wiped out large numbers of indigenous people 
12:260:21063:28:0:72:245:129:144:Times:144:Times:long before British settlers arrived.  
13:261:21103:0:28:108:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, we construct a dummy variable, Indigenous mortality, which equals one when a 
13:262:21186:28:27:72:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:region experienced large-scale indigenous mortality due to the spread of European diseases 
13:263:21277:27:28:72:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:during the initial stages of European exploration. To identify where Europeans brought diseases 
13:264:21373:28:28:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:that caused widespread fatalities, we use the population data of McEvedy and Jones (1978) and 
13:265:21467:28:27:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:three epidemiological world histories (McNeil 1976, Karlen 1995, Oldstone 1998). Diseases had 
13:266:21561:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:circulated enough across Eurasia, Africa and the sub-continent, so that indigenous mortality did 
13:267:21658:28:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:not shoot up with increased exposure to European explorers, traders, and slavers during the early 
13:268:21756:28:27:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:stages of European colonization. The New World (Americas and Caribbean) and Oceania (the 
13:269:21845:27:28:72:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:Pacific Islands, Australia, and New Zealand) were different. When European explorers and 
13:270:21934:28:27:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:traders arrived, the microbes that they brought triggered extremely high mortality rates, which 
13:271:22030:27:28:72:502:433:144:Times:144:Times:accords with their previous isolation from European diseases. The evidence suggests that 
13:272:22119:28:28:72:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:mortality rates of 90 percent of the indigenous population after European contact were not 
13:273:22210:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:unusual. Although we originally thought in terms of a country-by-country variable for large-
13:274:22302:27:28:72:509:350:144:Times:144:Times:scale indigenous mortality, our review of the evidence indicates little measurable variation 
13:275:22395:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:within the New World and Oceania. Consequently, Indigenous mortality is a simple dummy for 
13:276:22486:27:28:72:276:295:144:Times:144:Times:countries in the New World and Oceania.  
13:277:22526:28:28:107:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:The Indigenous mortality indicator has characteristics that make it a good instrument for 
13:278:22616:28:27:71:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:Euro share. History suggests that the key determinant of the indigenous mortality effects of 
13:279:22709:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:European’s making contact with other populations during the colonization period is the region’s 
13:280:22805:28:27:72:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:previous degree of isolation from Europe, not the extent of subsequent European settlement. 
13:281:22897:27:28:71:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:Hence, we do not believe that there is reverse causality running from European settlement to 
13:282:22989:28:28:72:181:129:144:Times:144:Times:Indigenous mortality.

14:284:23014:0:27:72:165:708:144:Times:144:Times:2 Preliminaries 
14:285:23028:27:27:86:235:681:144:Times:144:Times:2.1 Where Did People Settle? 
14:286:23055:27:28:107:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:European settlers confronted a non-European world of very uneven population density. 
14:287:23140:28:28:72:497:626:144:Times:144:Times:The pre-existing density had at least two material— but opposing—effects on European 
14:288:23225:28:27:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:settlement. First, indigenous population density probably reflected the attractiveness of the land 
14:289:23324:27:28:72:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:for human settlement, including Europeans. Second, indigenous population density probably 
14:290:23414:28:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:reflected the potential for the indigenous people to resist European settlers.  We will use the set 
14:291:23514:28:27:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:of variables described below to separate these two effects on European settlement during the 
14:292:23607:27:28:72:241:488:144:Times:144:Times:colonial period in the next section. 
14:293:23644:28:27:108:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1a examines the determinants of population density in 1500, drawing on a rich and 
14:294:23732:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:multidisciplinary literature.  The dependent variable is the logarithm of population density in 
14:295:23828:28:28:72:495:405:144:Times:144:Times:1500, which we call Population density 1500 and is taken from Acemoglu et al (2002).  
14:296:23913:28:27:108:478:377:144:Times:144:Times:We examine five potential determinants of population density in 1500. First, 
14:297:23990:27:28:72:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:Biogeography is an index of the prehistoric (about 12,000 years ago) availability of storable 
14:298:24084:28:27:72:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:crops and domesticable animals, where large values signify more mammalian herbivores and 
14:299:24173:27:28:72:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:omnivores weighing greater than 45 kilograms and more storable annual or perennial wilds 
14:300:24262:28:27:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:grasses, which are the ancestors of staple cereals (e.g., wheat, rice, corn, and barley).1 We expect 
14:301:24363:27:28:72:509:240:144:Times:144:Times:that Biogeography is positively associated with Population density 1500. Second, Latitude 
14:302:24453:28:28:72:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:measures the absolute value of the distance of the colony from the equator. Third, Malaria 
14:303:24544:28:27:72:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:ecology is an ecologically-based spatial index of the stability of malaria transmission in a region, 
14:304:24645:27:37:72:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:where larger valued signify a greater propensity for malaria transmission. The index is based on 
14:305:24742:37:7:72:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
14:306:24791:7:16:72:521:113:42:Times:99:Times:1 Taken from Hibbs and Olsson (2004), Biogeography equals the first principal component of (a) the number of 
14:307:24900:16:11:72:529:97:99:Times:99:Times:annual perennial wild grasses known to exist in the region in prehistoric times with mean kernel weight of greater 
14:308:25015:11:12:72:531:86:99:Times:99:Times:than ten milligrams and (b) the number of domesticable large mammals known to exist in the region in prehistoric 
14:309:25128:12:0:72:267:74:99:Times:99:Times:times with a mean weight of more than 45 kilos. 
15:310:25177:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:jointly assessing the impact of climate and the proportion of land area infected with malaria.2 We 
15:311:25276:28:27:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:do not have strong priors on the relationship between population density in 1500 and either 
15:312:25368:27:28:72:531:654:144:Times:144:Times:Latitude or Malaria ecology. While Latitude or Malaria ecology might influence the suitability 
15:313:25463:28:28:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:of a region to European settlement, it is not clear that they will shape population density before 
15:314:25562:28:27:72:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:European colonization. Fourth, Indigenous mortality is a dummy variable that equals one if the 
15:315:25657:27:28:72:491:571:144:Times:144:Times:region experienced a large drop in the indigenous population from diseases brought by 
15:316:25743:28:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans. As defined above, we constructed this variable from historical sources. Fifth, Settler 
15:317:25841:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:mortality equals historical deaths per annum per 1,000 European settlers (generally soldiers, or 
15:318:25938:27:28:72:483:488:144:Times:144:Times:bishops in Latin America) and is taken from AJR’s (2001) highly influential study of 
15:319:26023:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:comparative economic development. Though Albouy (forthcoming) has challenged the validity 
15:320:26113:27:28:72:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:of this indicator, we use Settler mortality to assess the association between European mortality 
15:321:26210:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:after colonization and population density prior to their arrival. Since Settler mortality occurs after 
15:322:26313:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:1500, we do not expect this to exert an independent, causal effect on population density in 1500. 
15:323:26410:27:28:108:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:We find that population density in 1500 was greater in environments that were more 
15:324:26493:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:conducive to the domestication of animals and the cultivation of storable plants as measured by 
15:325:26589:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:Biogeography, confirming the findings in Diamond (1997). These results are robust to including 
15:326:26684:28:28:72:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:the other explanatory variables. Thus, unsurprisingly, human settlement was denser in areas 
15:327:26776:28:27:72:248:239:144:Times:144:Times:where it was easier to produce food. 
15:328:26812:27:28:108:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:Several other characteristics do not have a robust, independent link with population 
15:329:26897:28:27:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:density in 1500. Features such as the Malaria ecology and Latitude are not associated with pre-
15:330:26992:27:28:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:Columbian population density in 1500. And, Settler mortality is not significantly correlated with 
15:331:27090:28:22:72:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:population density in 1500 after controlling for other characteristics of the country. This is 
15:332:27185:22:8:72:219:107:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:333:27234:8:15:72:514:99:42:Times:81:Times:2 The Malaria ecology index is from Kiszewski et al (2004) and captures of the stability of malaria transmission based 
15:334:27353:15:10:72:511:84:81:Times:81:Times:biological characteristics of mosquitoes such the proportion of blood meals taken from human hosts, daily survival of the 
15:335:27475:10:0:72:355:74:81:Times:99:Times:mosquito, and duration of the transmission season and of extrinsic incubation. 
16:336:27555:0:28:72:520:709:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with the view that although characteristics like the prevalence of malaria, distance 
16:337:27651:28:27:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:from the equator, and the extent of European mortality might have shaped European settlement 
16:338:27744:27:28:72:539:654:144:Times:144:Times:during colonization, these characteristics did not affect the population density of former colonies 
16:339:27844:28:28:72:199:626:144:Times:144:Times:before Europeans arrived. 
16:340:27870:28:27:108:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:It is curious that Indigenous mortality, which occurred after colonization, is negatively 
16:341:27960:27:28:72:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:associated with population density in 1500. This finding indicates that areas that were isolated 
16:342:28057:28:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:from Europeans prior to colonization and hence more susceptible to European-borne diseases 
16:343:28148:28:27:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:had lower population density in 1500 AD. This may be related to Spolaore and Wacziarg’s 
16:344:28236:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:(2009) result on diffusion of technology as a function of when different branches of humanity 
16:345:28330:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:became separated. Populations in Oceania and the Western Hemisphere had been isolated from 
16:346:28421:27:28:72:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:the rest for a very long time, and hence they did not get either (1) the more advanced technology 
16:347:28519:28:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:originating in the Old World that would have helped support a larger population or (2) the 
16:348:28610:28:27:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:exposure to European diseases before colonization that would have them more resistant to 
16:349:28699:27:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:European diseases and hence to European settlement. We will see that this combination of low 
16:350:28792:28:27:72:500:322:144:Times:144:Times:density and vulnerability to European diseases plays a large role in accounting for where 
16:351:28882:27:28:72:162:295:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans settled. 
16:352:28900:28:0:108:111:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:353:28902:0:28:86:254:709:144:Times:144:Times:2.2 Where Did Europeans Settle? 
17:354:28932:28:27:108:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:We now turn from the question of what shaped the settlement of humans before 1500 to 
17:355:29017:27:28:72:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:the question of what shaped the settlement of Europeans during the early stages of colonization. 
17:356:29114:28:28:72:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1b provides regression results concerning which factors shaped European settlement 
17:357:29203:28:27:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:during colonization, where the dependent variable is the proportion of Europeans in the colonial 
17:358:29300:27:28:72:203:571:144:Times:144:Times:population (Euro share).    
17:359:29328:28:28:108:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:The regressors in Table 1b are as follows. First, we include Population density 1500. 
17:360:29414:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:Since the regressions also include other variables to control for the attractiveness of the land for 
17:361:29515:27:28:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:settlement, we examine the relationship between Euro share and population density in 1500 
17:362:29605:28:27:72:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:conditional on the generalized attractiveness of the land for human settlement. A plausible 
17:363:29697:27:28:72:510:433:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation of the conditional impact of Population density 1500 on Euro share is that it 
17:364:29790:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:gauges the ability of the indigenous population to resist European settlement. Second, Indigenous 
17:365:29888:28:27:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:mortality provides additional information on the inability of the indigenous population to resist 
17:366:29986:27:28:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:European settlers. If European diseases eliminate much of the indigenous population, this would 
17:367:30082:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:clearly reduce their ability to oppose European settlement. Third, Latitude might have special 
17:368:30177:27:28:72:501:295:144:Times:144:Times:relevance for European settlers, who might be especially attracted to lands with the same 
17:369:30267:28:28:72:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:temperate climate as in Europe. Fourth, Precious Metals is an indicator of whether the region has 
17:370:30365:28:27:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:valuable minerals since this might have affected European settlement. Fifth, one cost of settling 
17:371:30463:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:in a particular country might be its distance from Europe, so we use the distance from London as 
17:372:30560:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:a gauge (London). Finally, we examine other possible determinants of the attractiveness of the 
17:373:30655:27:28:72:491:157:144:Times:144:Times:land for settlement from Table 1a, including Biogeography, Maria ecology, and Settler 
17:374:30741:28:0:72:126:129:144:Times:144:Times:Mortality.  
18:375:30755:0:28:108:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:The results show that three factors account for the bulk of cross-country variation in 
18:376:30842:28:27:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:European settlement during the colonial period. First, the density of the indigenous population 
18:377:30938:27:28:72:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:matters.  In regions with a high concentration of non-Europeans who had already occupied the 
18:378:31031:28:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:land and could supply forces of resistance, Europeans comprised a much smaller fraction of the 
18:379:31126:28:27:72:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:colonial population than in other lands.  Second, indigenous mortality matters. Where the 
18:380:31216:27:28:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:indigenous population fell drastically because of European diseases, European settlers were more 
18:381:31313:28:28:72:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:likely to settle. Third, many of the regressions also suggest positive relationship between Euro 
18:382:31410:28:27:72:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:share and Latitude, even when conditioning on Population density 1500 and Indigenous 
18:383:31495:27:28:72:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:mortality. In general, Europeans were a larger proportion of the colonial population in higher 
18:384:31590:28:27:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:(temperate) latitudes, plausibly because of the similarity with the climate conditions to their 
18:385:31686:27:28:72:488:433:144:Times:144:Times:home region. However, Latitude does not enter significantly when also controlling for 
18:386:31772:28:28:72:145:405:144:Times:144:Times:Biogeography. 
18:387:31786:28:27:108:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:None of the other possible determinants are significant after controlling for these three 
18:388:31876:27:28:72:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:determinants. The differences between 1a and 1b are important, because they might affect the 
18:389:31969:28:27:72:502:322:144:Times:144:Times:plausibility of the exclusion restrictions below when we use Population density 1500 and 
18:390:32057:27:28:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:Indigenous mortality as instruments for European settlement. European colonial settlement, 
18:391:32148:28:28:72:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:unlike pre-Columbian population, was NOT driven by the intrinsic, long-run potential of the 
18:392:32240:28:27:72:309:239:144:Times:144:Times:land—as measured especially by Biogeography.  
18:393:32286:27:28:108:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:Three factors, Population density 1500, Indigenous mortality, and Latitude help explain 
18:394:32374:28:27:72:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:in a simple way the big picture associated with European settlements, or the lack thereof, in 
18:395:32468:27:28:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:regions around the world. Where all three factors were favorable for European settlement, such 
18:396:32563:28:28:72:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, the European share of the colonial 
18:397:32656:28:0:72:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:population was very high. When only some of the three factors were favorable, there tended to 
19:398:32752:0:28:72:494:709:144:Times:144:Times:be a minority share of European settlers. Latin America suffered large-scale indigenous 
19:399:32840:28:27:71:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:mortality, but only some regions were temperate, and most regions had relatively high pre-
19:400:32930:27:28:71:538:654:144:Times:144:Times:Columbian population density (which is why more people of indigenous origin survived in Latin 
19:401:33024:28:28:71:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:America compared to North America, even though both regions experience high indigenous 
19:402:33111:28:27:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:mortality rates when exposed to European diseases).  Southern Africa was temperate and had 
19:403:33202:27:28:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:low population density, but did not experience large-scale indigenous mortality. These factors 
19:404:33297:28:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:can also explain where Europeans did not settle. The rest of sub-Saharan Africa was tropical and 
19:405:33394:28:27:71:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:again did not experience much indigenous mortality from exposure to the microbes brought by 
19:406:33486:27:28:71:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans during colonization. And, most of Asia had high population density, did not suffer 
19:407:33579:28:27:71:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:much indigenous mortality from European borne diseases, and is in or near the tropics, all of 
19:408:33673:27:28:71:444:433:144:Times:144:Times:which combine to explain the low values of Euro share across much of Asia. 
19:409:33747:28:28:107:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:One of the most famous variables in the literature on explaining European settlement is 
19:410:33835:28:27:71:503:377:144:Times:144:Times:the Settler mortality measure calculated by AJR. Our collection of actual data on colonial 
19:411:33926:27:28:71:533:350:144:Times:144:Times:settlement allows this explanatory value to be tested for the first time. This variable does have a 
19:412:34026:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:significant simple correlation with European settlement, confirming the prediction in AJR. But, 
19:413:34122:27:28:71:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:when entered with the three variables that we found most robust in other specifications, the 
19:414:34215:28:28:71:506:267:144:Times:144:Times:settler mortality variable becomes insignificant and does not materially alter the statistical 
19:415:34310:28:27:71:499:239:144:Times:144:Times:significance of the other variables (though it does reduce the magnitude of their estimate 
19:416:34401:27:28:71:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients). Apparently, Settler mortality does not exert an independent effect on Euro share, 
19:417:34498:28:27:71:224:184:144:Times:144:Times:but Indigenous mortality does.

20:420:34562:27:27:86:330:681:144:Times:144:Times:3.1 Do Europeans Matter? Introductory thoughts 
20:421:34607:27:28:108:510:654:144:Times:144:Times:We begin by assessing the relationship between Euro share and the current level of 
20:422:34690:28:28:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:economic development as measured by the average of the log of real per capita GDP over the 
20:423:34781:28:27:72:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:decade from 1995 to 2005 (Current income). Using data averaged over a decade reduces the 
20:424:34870:27:28:72:532:571:144:Times:144:Times:influences of business cycle fluctuations on our measure of current economic development. We 
20:425:34963:28:28:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:condition on a range of national characteristics to assess the independent relationship between 
20:426:35059:28:27:72:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:Current income and Euro share. Controlling for an array of other potential determinants of 
20:427:35150:27:28:72:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:economic development also provides some suggestive evidence on the channels linking Euro 
20:428:35239:28:27:72:209:460:144:Times:144:Times:share and Current income.   
20:429:35267:27:29:107:362:433:144:Times:144:Times:We consider the following cross-country regression: 
20:430:35318:29:28:100:541:404:144:Times:144:Times:Current income = α*Euro share + β′X + u,                                                                        (1) 
20:431:35433:28:28:71:510:376:144:Times:144:Times:where X is a matrix of national characteristics that we define below, and u is an error term, 
20:432:35527:28:28:71:525:348:144:Times:144:Times:potentially reflecting economic growth factors that are idiosyncratic to particular countries, as 
20:433:35625:28:28:71:506:320:144:Times:144:Times:well as omitted variables, and mis-specification of the functional form.  Different theories 
20:434:35718:28:29:71:528:292:144:Times:144:Times:provide distinct predictions about (a) the coefficient on Euro share (α), (b) whether α changes 
20:435:35814:29:29:71:510:263:144:Times:144:Times:when conditioning on particular national characteristics, and (c) how α changes across sub-
20:436:35905:29:28:71:179:234:144:Times:144:Times:samples of countries.  
20:437:35927:28:28:107:519:206:144:Times:144:Times:We get some insight into the channels connecting Euro share and Current income by 
20:438:36009:28:29:71:538:178:144:Times:144:Times:examining how α changes when controlling for the different potential channels discussed above: 
20:439:36104:29:27:71:501:149:144:Times:144:Times:political institutions and human capital. Thus, if Euro share is related to current levels of 
20:440:36198:27:28:71:538:122:144:Times:144:Times:economic development through its effect on the formation of enduring political institutions, then 
20:441:36296:28:0:71:531:94:144:Times:144:Times:Euro share will not enjoy an independent relationship with economic development today when 
21:442:36389:0:28:72:513:709:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for political institutions. And, if Euro share is related to economic development 
21:443:36483:28:27:72:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:today through its effect on the spread of human capital, then Euro share will not enter 
21:444:36571:27:28:72:539:654:144:Times:144:Times:significantly when controlling for educational attainment today. We examine these issues below.

21:447:36702:27:28:108:492:571:144:Times:144:Times:We begin by evaluating equation (1) while conditioning on an array of national 
21:448:36781:28:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics (X). Legal origin is dummy variable that equals one if the country has a common 
21:449:36877:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:law (British) legal tradition.  This dummy variable both captures the argument by North (1990) 
21:450:36972:27:28:72:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:that the United Kingdom instilled better growth-promoting institutions than other European 
21:451:37063:28:27:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:powers and the view advanced by La Porta et al (2008) that the British legal tradition was more 
21:452:37159:27:28:72:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:conducive to the development of growth-enhancing financial systems than other legal origins, 
21:453:37252:28:28:72:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:such as the Napoleonic Code passed on by French and other European colonizers. Education 
21:454:37340:28:27:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:equals the average gross rate of secondary school enrollment from 1995 to 2005 and is taken 
21:455:37432:27:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:from the World Development Indicators. Independence equals the fraction of years since 1776 
21:456:37523:28:27:72:503:322:144:Times:144:Times:that a country has been independent. As in Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2003) and 
21:457:37609:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:Easterly and Levine (2003), we use this to measure the degree to which a country has had the 
21:458:37702:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:time to develop its own economic institutions. Government quality is an index of current level of 
21:459:37800:28:27:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:government accountability and effectiveness and is taken from Kaufman et at (2002). Ethnicity is 
21:460:37897:27:28:72:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:from Easterly and Levine (1997) and measures each country’s degree of ethnic diversity. In 
21:461:37988:28:27:71:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:particular, it measures the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a country are 
21:462:38086:27:28:71:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:from different ethnolinguistic groups. Finally, as defined above, Settler mortality measures the 
21:463:38183:28:0:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:degree to which European mortality during the colonial period. Since the purpose of our research 
22:464:38282:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:is to examine the impact of European settlement outside of Europe, all of the regressions exclude 
22:465:38380:28:27:72:171:681:144:Times:144:Times:European countries. 
22:466:38399:27:28:108:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:Using ordinary least squares (OLS), Table 2a shows that there is—with a few notable 
22:467:38483:28:28:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:exceptions—a positive, significant relation between Current income and Euro share.  For 
22:468:38571:28:27:72:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:example, regression (1) indicates that an increase in Euro share of 0.1 (where the mean value of 
22:469:38668:27:28:72:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:Euro share is 0.07 and the standard deviation is 0.07) is associated with an increase in Current 
22:470:38765:28:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:income of 0.36 (where the mean value of Current income is 8.2 and the standard deviation is 
22:471:38857:28:27:71:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:1.3). The strong positive link between the European share of the population during colonization 
22:472:38953:27:28:71:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:and current economic development holds when conditioning on different national characteristics, 
22:473:39049:28:27:71:484:460:144:Times:144:Times:with two key exceptions. The coefficient on Euro share falls drastically and becomes 
22:474:39134:27:28:71:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant when conditioning on either Government quality or Education.  These findings are 
22:475:39229:28:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with—though by no means a definitive demonstration of—the views that the share of 
22:476:39322:28:27:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans in the population during colonization shaped long-run economic development by 
22:477:39410:27:28:72:377:350:144:Times:144:Times:affecting political institutions and human capital accumulation. 
22:478:39475:28:27:108:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:These results could be driven by a few former colonies in which Europeans were a large 
22:479:39562:27:28:72:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:fraction of the population during the early stages of economic development and that just happen 
22:480:39658:28:28:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:to be well-developed former colonies today. Thus, we conduct the analyses for a sample of 
22:481:39748:28:27:72:527:239:144:Times:144:Times:countries in which Euro share was less than 15 percent.3  The goal of restricting the sample to 
22:482:39844:27:28:72:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:only those countries where Europeans account for a small proportion of the population is to 
22:483:39936:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:assess whether the relation between Euro share and Current income holds when there is only a 
22:484:40029:27:48:72:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:small minority of Europeans.  While there is no formal definition of what constitutes a “minority 
22:485:40127:48:7:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
22:486:40176:7:16:72:536:102:42:Times:99:Times:3 We also considering entering Euro Share in a quadratic function, in a spline regression, or in some other nonlinear 
22:487:40294:16:12:72:514:86:99:Times:99:Times:function. However, these functional forms do not lend themselves to the IV techniques we will use in the next 
22:488:40404:12:0:72:541:74:99:Times:99:Times:section, so we chose instead to stick with the procedure of a restricted sample in which Euro Share was less than .15. 
23:489:40524:0:28:72:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:European colony,” we use less than 15 percent European as a conservative benchmark of a non-
23:490:40616:28:27:72:146:681:144:Times:144:Times:settler colony.  
23:491:40632:27:28:108:527:654:144:Times:144:Times:As shown in Table 2b, however, the coefficient on Euro share actually becomes larger 
23:492:40717:28:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:when restricting the sample to those countries in which Euro share is less than 15 percent. The 
23:493:40813:28:27:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:increase in the coefficient on Euro share when restricting the sample to former colonies with 
23:494:40907:27:28:72:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:small values of Euro share suggests that the relationship between the European share of the 
23:495:40999:28:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:population during colonization and the level of economic development does not simply represent 
23:496:41094:28:27:72:510:515:144:Times:144:Times:the economic success of “settler colonies.” Rather, a marginal increase in Euro share has a 
23:497:41185:27:28:72:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:bigger effect on subsequent economic development in colonies with only a few Europeans—
23:498:41272:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:there seems to be diminishing marginal long-run development product to Euro share. A marginal 
23:499:41366:27:28:71:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:increase in Euro share is associated with an especially large boost to long-run economic growth 
23:500:41461:28:28:71:350:405:144:Times:144:Times:in former colonies with only a small share of Europeans.  
23:501:41518:28:27:107:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:The relationship between Current income and Euro share is sensitive to controlling for 
23:502:41605:27:28:71:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:political institutions and especially to controlling for human capital accumulation. As shown in 
23:503:41702:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2b, the size of the economic association between Current income and Euro share shrinks 
23:504:41795:27:28:72:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:and becomes insignificant when conditioning on educational attainment (regression 3), and the 
23:505:41889:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:association between Current income and Euro share shrinks though remains significant at the 10 
23:506:41984:28:27:72:418:239:144:Times:144:Times:percent level when conditioning on political institutions (regression 5).  
23:507:42058:27:28:108:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:The coefficient on British legal origin is never significant (nor will it be in the rest of the 
23:508:42154:28:27:72:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:paper). It is also of interest that many of the colonies with Euro Share < .15 were Spanish 
23:509:42246:27:28:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:colonies. Hence we find no evidence for the popular view that British colonization or legal origin 
23:510:42345:28:28:72:395:129:144:Times:144:Times:led to more development than Spanish colonization or legal origin.

24:513:42442:28:27:108:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:To control for potential simultaneity bias, we seek to employ instrumental variables that 
24:514:42532:27:28:72:511:654:144:Times:144:Times:are correlated with the proportion of Europeans during colonization but that are unlikely to 
24:515:42625:28:28:72:539:626:144:Times:144:Times:explain current levels of economic development beyond their effect on Euro share. Based on the 
24:516:42720:28:27:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:evidence presented in Table 1b concerning the determinants of Euro share, we use Population 
24:517:42812:27:28:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:density 1500 and Indigenous mortality as instruments for Euro Share. Although Latitude also 
24:518:42904:28:28:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:helps explain Euro share in Table 1b, it is more difficult to argue that Latitude only influences 
24:519:43002:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:economic development today through its effect on Euro share. Latitude might also have affected 
24:520:43097:27:28:71:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:the ability of Europeans to transfer technologies from Europe to other parts of the globe, with 
24:521:43193:28:27:71:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:long-term ramifications on economic development beyond its effects on Euro share. Latitude is 
24:522:43287:27:28:71:533:433:144:Times:144:Times:indeed one of the most common instruments in the entire cross-country literature, suggestive of 
24:523:43383:28:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:many other postulated channels by which it affects development. Thus, we do not include 
24:524:43471:28:27:72:207:377:144:Times:144:Times:Latitude as an instrument.4  
24:525:43500:27:28:108:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:Standard specification tests support the validity of the instruments. First, the first-stage 
24:526:43593:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:regression, which is presented in column 1 of Table 1b, is powerful. It has a high F-statistic that 
24:527:43693:27:28:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:makes weak instruments unlikely to be a problem. Furthermore, we show that the instruments 
24:528:43784:28:28:72:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:reject the Kleibergen Paap (2006) LM test of weak instruments in Tables 3a and 3b. Second, we 
24:529:43878:28:27:72:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:use a standard over-identification (OIR) test of whether the instruments—Population density 
24:530:43970:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:1500 and Indigenous mortality—explain Current income beyond their effect on Euro share.  As 
24:531:44062:28:27:72:496:184:144:Times:144:Times:shown in Tables 3a and 3b, the instrumental variables do not reject the OIR test that the 
24:532:44152:27:28:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:instruments are valid. Although we are aware that exclusion restrictions in macro regressions are 
24:533:44250:28:20:72:504:129:144:Times:144:Times:seldom completely credible, and that OIR tests suffer from low power, the OIR test is not 
24:534:44340:20:7:72:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
24:535:44389:7:16:72:540:102:42:Times:99:Times:4 When including Latitude as an instrument, the coefficient estimate on Euro share changes little, but the OIR-test is 
24:536:44508:16:12:71:520:86:99:Times:99:Times:sometimes rejected, suggesting that indeed Latitude explains economic development today beyond its ability to 
24:537:44618:12:0:71:466:74:99:Times:99:Times:account for cross-country differences in the European share of the population during colonization. 
25:538:44718:0:28:72:489:709:144:Times:144:Times:rejected and there are sound conceptual reasons for using Population density 1500 and 
25:539:44804:28:27:72:299:681:144:Times:144:Times:Indigenous mortality as excluded instruments.  
25:540:44850:27:28:107:517:654:144:Times:144:Times:The impact of Euro share on Current income is economically large, especially when 
25:541:44932:28:28:71:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:restricting the analyses to former colonies in which Europeans were a small minority of the 
25:542:45024:28:27:71:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:population (less than 15%) during the early stages of colonization. For example, again consider 
25:543:45120:27:28:71:524:571:144:Times:144:Times:an increase in Euro share of 0.10.  The estimated coefficient on Euro share in regression 1 of 
25:544:45215:28:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3b (21) indicates that an increase in the proportion of Europeans during colonization of ten 
25:545:45314:28:27:72:527:515:144:Times:144:Times:percentage points will translate into an increase in real per capita income today of 2.1.  This is 
25:546:45413:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:large. For example, consider just a one percentage point increase in Euro share in the case of 
25:547:45508:28:27:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:Brazil. The estimated coefficients suggest that if Brazil had a Euro share of 0.084 rather than 
25:548:45604:27:28:71:512:433:144:Times:144:Times:0.074, then its average GDP per capita over the period from 1995 to 2005 would have been 
25:549:45693:28:28:71:197:405:144:Times:144:Times:$9,798 instead of $7,942. 
25:550:45718:28:27:107:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:The instrumental variable results again emphasize a key, and surprising, finding: far from 
25:551:45809:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:being attenuated, the economic development effect of an additional percentage point of European 
25:552:45905:28:27:71:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:population during the colonial period is much larger in minority European colonies than in a 
25:553:45998:27:28:71:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:majority European colony. While an enormous body of research documents and emphasizes the 
25:554:46088:28:28:71:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:exploitative behavior of minority white populations around the world, the regressions suggest 
25:555:46182:28:27:71:514:239:144:Times:144:Times:that Europeans brought factors of production that boosted long-run economic development, 
25:556:46271:27:28:71:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:especially among colonies with a only a few Europeans. As we emphasized in the introduction, 
25:557:46364:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:this is not a welfare calculation—GDP per capita today does not measure the welfare effects of 
25:558:46459:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:colonization. We are simply observing that contrary to some theories, and consistent with others, 
25:559:46557:28:28:71:513:129:144:Times:144:Times:a marginal increase in European settlement in a geographic area during colonization had an 
25:560:46648:28:0:71:520:101:144:Times:144:Times:especially positive effect on the level of economic development today within that geographic 
26:561:46743:0:28:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:region, especially in places that had only a small, minority of Europeans living in the area during 
26:562:46843:28:27:72:140:681:144:Times:144:Times:colonization.  
26:563:46857:27:28:108:519:654:144:Times:144:Times:The relationship between Current income and Euro share weakens appreciably when 
26:564:46937:28:28:72:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:conditioning on Education and weakens slightly when controlling for Government quality, 
26:565:47025:28:27:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:especially when focusing on the sample of countries with less than 15 percent Euro share.  In 
26:566:47119:27:28:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3b, the estimated coefficient on the exogenous component of Euro share drops by about 
26:567:47211:28:28:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:two-thirds and become significant at only the 10 percent level when controlling for Education, 
26:568:47306:28:27:72:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:suggesting that the relation between Euro share and Current income is not independent of its 
26:569:47399:27:28:72:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:association with Education. The relationship between Current income and Euro share also 
26:570:47487:28:27:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:changes when conditioning on Government quality. In Table 3b, controlling for Government 
26:571:47576:27:28:72:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:quality reduces the size of the estimated coefficient on Euro share by about one-third, although it 
26:572:47676:28:28:72:283:405:144:Times:144:Times:remains significant at the one percent level. 
26:573:47721:28:27:108:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:This is suggestive again that the human capital and institutional channels are important 
26:574:47810:27:28:72:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:for the effect of colonial European settlement on development today, with stronger evidence for 
26:575:47906:28:27:72:484:322:144:Times:144:Times:the human capital channel. Of course, we do not control for the potential endogenous 
26:576:47991:27:28:72:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:determination of education and political institutions (an important but inescapable caveat given 
26:577:48088:28:28:72:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:the usual inability to develop a full identification strategy covering three endogenous regressors). 
26:578:48189:28:27:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:And, so we simply provide these analyses as suggestive of the potential channels, without nailing 
26:579:48287:27:28:72:389:212:144:Times:144:Times:them down empirically—a nontrivial task left for future research. 
26:580:48352:28:27:107:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:Overall, the IV findings are suggestive of a causal impact of colonial European settlement 
26:581:48443:27:28:71:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:on per capita income today. We are of course aware of the many plausible criticisms of the 
26:582:48534:28:28:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:internal validity of causal effects in cross-country macro regressions. The OLS results would still 
26:583:48634:28:0:71:536:101:144:Times:144:Times:remain of considerable interest in establishing a robust correlation between European settlement 
27:584:48733:0:28:72:515:709:144:Times:144:Times:a long time ago and outcomes today. Along with a wide array of recent research, our results 
27:585:48825:28:27:72:492:681:144:Times:144:Times:indicate that historical factors play an enduring role in shaping economic development. 
27:586:48912:27:28:108:111:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:587:48912:28:28:86:388:626:144:Times:144:Times:3.4 Is it Europeans during Colonization or Europeans today? 
27:588:48971:28:27:108:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:Euro share might proxy for the proportion of the current population that is of European 
27:589:49059:27:28:71:530:571:144:Times:144:Times:descent. Figure 1 shows there is indeed a positive association between colonial Euro share and 
27:590:49154:28:28:72:481:543:144:Times:144:Times:European share in modern times (measured in 2000 from Putterman and Weil 2010). 
27:591:49234:28:27:72:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:Consequently, it may be inappropriate to interpret the results on Euro share as reflecting the 
27:592:49329:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:enduring impact of Europeans during the colonization period on economic development.  Rather, 
27:593:49423:28:27:72:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans might have simply migrated to economically successful countries after colonization.   
27:594:49519:27:28:108:520:433:144:Times:144:Times: To assess the strength of the independent relationship between the level of economic 
27:595:49605:28:28:72:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:development today and the European share of the population during the early stages of the 
27:596:49695:28:27:72:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:colonial, we therefore control for the proportion of the population today that is of European 
27:597:49789:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:descent (Tables 4a and 4b). We would like to use instrumental variables for both Euro share and 
27:598:49885:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:the fraction of the population today that is of European descent and therefore separately identify 
27:599:49984:27:28:72:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:the impact of each on Current income. But, we faced a weak instruments problem: we could not 
27:600:50077:28:28:72:534:267:144:Times:144:Times:find instrumental variables that separately explained Euro share and the current European share 
27:601:50173:28:27:72:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:of the population, while also satisfying the exclusion restriction. Since the standard errors of the 
27:602:50274:27:28:72:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:IV regressions are not reported correctly with a weak instruments problem, we do not report 
27:603:50366:28:27:72:508:184:144:Times:144:Times:them.  Instead, we use OLS regressions to produce suggestive partial correlations between 
27:604:50456:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:Current income and Euro share while controlling for the proportion of Europeans today (Euro 
27:605:50548:28:0:72:284:129:144:Times:144:Times:2000 P-W) and other explanatory variables. 
28:606:50592:0:28:108:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:We find a positive relationship between Current income and Euro share even when 
28:607:50672:28:27:71:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for the current proportion of the population of European descent.  Euro 2000 P-W is 
28:608:50768:27:28:71:509:654:144:Times:144:Times:usually significant, but Euro share remains significant in the same regressions as in earlier 
28:609:50862:28:28:71:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:results. That is, the significance (of both old and current Euro share) vanishes when we control 
28:610:50959:28:27:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:for the channels of human capital or institutions, but is significant in other regressions. These 
28:611:51057:27:28:71:497:571:144:Times:144:Times:results are robust to limiting the sample to having the colonial Euro share less than .15.  
28:612:51149:28:28:107:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:A graph helps understand whether the proportion of Europeans during the colonization 
28:613:51234:28:27:71:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:period is more strongly associated with current economic development than the proportion of the 
28:614:51330:27:28:71:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:population today that is of European descent. Examining the scatter plot in Figure 1, consider 
28:615:51425:28:27:71:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:three groups of countries: (1) countries in which Euro share was high both in colonial times and 
28:616:51522:27:28:71:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:today (e.g. North America), (2) countries in which Euro share was low both in colonial times and 
28:617:51619:28:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:today (e.g. South Africa), and (3) countries in which Euro share today is much higher than it was 
28:618:51717:28:27:71:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:in colonial times (e.g. some Central and South American countries). If colonial Euro share did 
28:619:51812:27:28:71:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:not matter independently for income today, then we would expect group (3)’s income to be more 
28:620:51906:28:27:71:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:like group (1)’s income. But, this is not what we find. In contrast, if colonial Euro share does 
28:621:52003:27:28:71:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:matter independently for income today, then we would expect group (3)’s income to have lower 
28:622:52096:28:28:71:499:267:144:Times:144:Times:income than group (1) and to have similar income to group (2). This is what we observe, 
28:623:52184:28:27:71:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:illustrating the finding that the proportion of Europeans during the colonization period is 
28:624:52276:27:28:71:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:independently associated with economic development today, and the results are not driven by the 
28:625:52372:28:27:71:227:184:144:Times:144:Times:proportion of Europeans today.

30:703:53932:41:27:71:523:658:144:Times:144:Times:income is not a welfare measure, especially in light of the history of European exploitation of 
30:704:54028:27:28:71:528:631:144:Times:144:Times:non-Europeans. As an exercise in positive analysis, however, it is striking how much of global 
30:705:54123:28:28:71:517:603:144:Times:144:Times:development is associated with Europeans (not even considering the development of Europe 
30:706:54212:28:27:71:105:575:144:Times:144:Times:itself).

30:708:54220:28:27:71:151:520:144:Times:144:Times:5.  Conclusions 
30:709:54235:27:28:108:539:493:144:Times:144:Times:The results are consistent with the view that the proportion of Europeans during the early 
30:710:54326:28:28:72:525:465:144:Times:144:Times:stages of colonization exerted an enduring, positive impact on economic development.  These 
30:711:54418:28:27:72:517:437:144:Times:144:Times:findings hold when (1) restricting the sample to non-settler colonies, (2) conditioning on the 
30:712:54513:27:28:72:539:410:144:Times:144:Times:current proportion of the population of European descent, and (3) using instrumental variables to 
30:713:54611:28:27:72:314:382:144:Times:144:Times:extract the exogenous component of Euro share.   
30:714:54660:27:28:108:494:355:144:Times:144:Times:These results relate to theories of the origins of the divergent paths of economic 
30:715:54743:28:28:72:510:327:144:Times:144:Times:development followed since Europeans colonization.  Engerman and Sokoloff (ES) (1997) 
30:716:54829:28:27:72:528:299:144:Times:144:Times:emphasize that agricultural, mineral, the size and robustness of the indigenous population, and 
30:717:54925:27:28:72:524:272:144:Times:144:Times:other endowments encountered by Europeans affected the formation of institutions, including 
30:718:55017:28:27:72:522:244:144:Times:144:Times:political institutions, with long-run effects on economic development.  ES emphasize that the 
30:719:55111:27:28:72:537:217:144:Times:144:Times:degree of European settlement reflects these endowments, but Europeans per se are not a causal, 
30:720:55207:28:28:72:536:189:144:Times:144:Times:independent explanation of the divergent paths of economic development since colonization.  In 
30:721:55302:28:27:72:522:161:144:Times:144:Times:the findings presented above, however, the proportion of Europeans during the early colonial 
30:722:55395:27:28:72:523:134:144:Times:144:Times:period had a lasting effect beyond endowments and political institutions—Europeans brought 
30:723:55486:28:27:72:517:106:144:Times:144:Times:factors that fostered long-run economic development. ES also suggested a negative effect of 
30:724:55578:27:0:72:519:79:144:Times:144:Times:minority European settlement, but we find no evidence of this. We find the positive effect of 
31:725:55674:0:28:72:536:709:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans during colonization on economic development today becomes larger—not smaller or 
31:726:55764:28:27:72:477:681:144:Times:144:Times:negative—when examining only former colonies with a very few European settlers. 
31:727:55844:27:28:108:541:654:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, AJR stress that when endowments lead to the formation of settler colonies, this 
31:728:55935:28:28:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:produced more egalitarian, enduring political institutions that fostered long-run economic 
31:729:56026:28:27:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:development. We have shown nothing to contradict this view. But, it is not the full story. The 
31:730:56121:27:28:71:491:571:144:Times:144:Times:institutional measure does not robustly win a horse race with the European share of the 
31:731:56209:28:28:71:493:543:144:Times:144:Times:population during the early stages of colonization. Furthermore, our results are also not 
31:732:56299:28:27:71:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with the “Northian” (1990) view that British institutions independently account for a 
31:733:56396:27:28:71:348:488:144:Times:144:Times:large proportion of comparative economic development.  
31:734:56451:28:27:107:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:In contrast, a measure of education today does consistently win a horse race with colonial 
31:735:56542:27:28:71:509:433:144:Times:144:Times:European share. Although hardly definitive, the results are more consistent with the GLLS 
31:736:56632:28:28:71:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:argument that Europeans brought human capital and human capital creating institutions and the 
31:737:56726:28:27:71:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:Galor and Weil (2000) and Galor, Moav, and Vollrath (2008) emphasis on the role of human 
31:738:56815:27:28:71:464:350:144:Times:144:Times:capital accumulation in explaining the divergence of economies in the long-run.   
31:739:56897:28:27:107:529:322:144:Times:144:Times:The previous literature was correct to focus on colonial settlement by Europeans as one 
31:740:56985:27:28:71:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:of the pivotal events in the history of economic development. We confirmed it in this paper by 
31:741:57080:28:28:71:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:directly measuring this colonial European settlement for the first time and showing it to have 
31:742:57175:28:0:71:248:239:144:Times:144:Times:dramatic effects on outcomes today.

47:1441:81642:28:27:108:514:612:144:Times:144:Times:This appendix describes the construction of the dataset on the European share of the 
47:1442:81727:27:28:72:523:585:144:Times:144:Times:population in countries around the world during the early stages of colonization. The primary 
47:1443:81821:28:28:72:527:557:144:Times:144:Times:goal is to define what we did, so that the numbers are transparent and replicable. At the end of 
47:1444:81918:28:27:72:540:529:144:Times:144:Times:the appendix, we list some of the problems that we encountered in constructing the database, and 
47:1445:82015:27:28:72:528:502:144:Times:144:Times:the difficulties that we faced in choosing which years to use in defining a country’s “European 
47:1446:82111:28:28:72:506:474:144:Times:144:Times:share of the population during the early stages of colonization.” The dataset and other key 
47:1447:82203:28:27:72:500:446:144:Times:144:Times:information are contained in the excel workbook titled “Appendix_Europeans,” which is 
47:1448:82289:27:28:72:539:419:144:Times:144:Times:available on request. In this Appendix when discussing details of the dataset, we refer to specific 
47:1449:82389:28:27:72:238:391:144:Times:144:Times:worksheets within this workbook. 
47:1450:82422:27:28:108:111:364:144:Times:144:Times: 
47:1451:82422:28:28:72:220:336:144:Times:144:Times:Data sources and definitions 
47:1452:82450:28:27:107:535:308:144:Times:144:Times:We primarily rely on 46 sources, which are listed in the worksheet titled  “bibliography” 
47:1453:82540:27:28:71:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:and the worksheet titled “web.” Many of these are scholarly books about particular regions or 
47:1454:82634:28:27:71:524:253:144:Times:144:Times:countries and some are atlases. As a few examples, Robert Wells wrote The Population of the 
47:1455:82726:27:28:71:510:226:144:Times:144:Times:British Colonies in America before 1776; Simeon Ominde wrote The Population of Kenya, 
47:1456:82812:28:28:71:536:198:144:Times:144:Times:Tanzania, and Uganda; and, McEvedy and Jones assembled Atlas of World Population History. 
47:1457:82902:28:27:71:541:170:144:Times:144:Times:We also use primary sources (such as national and colonial censuses) to both check these sources 
47:1458:82999:27:28:71:540:143:144:Times:144:Times:and to expand the number of countries and data points. Besides the books and official documents 
47:1459:83095:28:27:71:524:115:144:Times:144:Times:listed in the worksheet “bibliography,” some datasets are provided online. We list these in the 
47:1460:83191:27:0:71:160:88:144:Times:144:Times:worksheet “web.” 
48:1461:83209:0:28:108:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:In terms of defining “European settlers,” we strive in collecting the data to identify 
48:1462:83296:28:27:72:493:681:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans as people from the geographic region of Europe; it is NOT a racial or ethnic 
48:1463:83383:27:28:72:518:654:144:Times:144:Times:description. So, some observers might consider the populations of some countries outside of 
48:1464:83475:28:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:Europe as racially or ethnically equivalent to Europeans, but that is irrelevant to us. We are only 
48:1465:83575:28:27:72:481:598:144:Times:144:Times:concerned with resettlement from Europe to outside Europe, defined geographically. 
48:1466:83658:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:Furthermore, in assembling the data on settlers, we strive to exclude colonial officials or business 
48:1467:83759:28:28:72:488:543:144:Times:144:Times:people that are temporarily stationed abroad; we strive to only include Europeans who 
48:1468:83845:28:27:72:263:515:144:Times:144:Times:permanently resettle outside of Europe. 
48:1469:83884:27:28:108:111:488:144:Times:144:Times: 
48:1470:83884:28:27:72:254:460:144:Times:144:Times:Data: By country, year, and source 
48:1471:83918:27:28:108:531:433:144:Times:144:Times:For each country, we provide an entry for each year for which we found information on 
48:1472:84004:28:28:72:492:405:144:Times:144:Times:the European share of the population. For each data point, we provide the source of the 
48:1473:84092:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:information (including the page number) and brief notes about the data, whenever relevant.  
48:1474:84184:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:Some of these notes are important. For example, the 1744 and 1778 values for Argentina are 
48:1475:84275:28:27:72:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:based only on the population around Buenos Aires, for the country as a whole. Similarly, one of 
48:1476:84371:27:28:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:the values for Ecuador in 1781 measures only the population around Quito. These notes, the data, 
48:1477:84468:28:28:72:486:267:144:Times:144:Times:and the sources of each data point are listed in the worksheet, “country_year_source.” 
48:1478:84554:28:27:108:528:239:144:Times:144:Times:For example, Lyle N. McAlister, in Spain and Portugal in the New World, 1492 -1700, 
48:1479:84638:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:(University of Minnesota Press, 1984) provides data on page 131 on the population of Argentina 
48:1480:84733:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:in 1570. He notes that there are 2000 whites, 4000 blacks, 300,000 “others” in Argentina. Since 
48:1481:84829:27:28:72:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:whites are typically used to describe people of European descent, we calculate European share in 
48:1482:84926:28:0:72:217:129:144:Times:144:Times:Argentina in 1570 as 0.0065.  
49:1483:84958:0:28:108:505:709:144:Times:144:Times:In some cases, the data sources provide a range of years (rather than a single year) 
49:1484:85043:28:27:72:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding to data on the share of the population that is European. For example, one of the 
49:1485:85138:27:28:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:observations on Mexico is listed as 1568-1570 in the underlying data.  In these cases, we choose 
49:1486:85235:28:28:72:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:the average of the range and enter this as the year for the observation.  Thus, for the Mexico 
49:1487:85330:28:27:72:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:example, we choose the year 1569 when entering the data. All of these cases are separately 
49:1488:85421:27:28:72:538:571:144:Times:144:Times:identified in the worksheet “periods.” This has no bearing on our analyses, but might be relevant 
49:1489:85519:28:28:72:215:543:144:Times:144:Times:for others that use these data. 
49:1490:85550:28:27:108:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:In a few cases, we found two data sources that provide information on the same year (or 
49:1491:85638:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:range of years) for the same country.  In some cases, these two data sources agree, in which case 
49:1492:85736:28:27:72:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:we simply report both observations within the worksheet “country_year_sources.” In a few 
49:1493:85825:27:28:72:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:cases, the data sources give different numbers for the share of Europeans in a country in a given 
49:1494:85923:28:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:year. In this case, we report both numbers in the worksheet “country_year_sources” and use the 
49:1495:86018:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:average of the two observations when constructing the data on which we conduct our analyses. 
49:1496:86110:27:28:108:111:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
49:1497:86110:28:27:72:315:322:144:Times:144:Times:Data:  Share of Europeans used in the analyses 
49:1498:86156:27:28:108:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:From these data scattered over many years since the 16th century, we construct several 
49:1499:86243:28:28:71:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:measures of the share of Europeans during colonization for each country, where we have one 
49:1500:86334:28:27:71:501:239:144:Times:144:Times:measure per country. To do this, we arrange the data in a manner that is amenable for the 
49:1501:86424:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:construction of a single measure of the share of Europeans during colonization for each country. 
49:1502:86521:28:27:71:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:In the worksheet “euro share,” each row is a country. The columns provide possible data entries 
49:1503:86617:27:28:71:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:for many years running from 1540 (which is our first observation, for Chile) through to the late 
49:1504:86714:28:27:71:529:129:144:Times:144:Times:20th century. We do not include all years as column headings; rather, we only include years for 
49:1505:86810:27:0:72:378:102:144:Times:144:Times:which we have at least one non-missing value for one country.  
50:1506:86874:0:28:108:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:First, we construct simple, objective measures that average the value of each country over 
50:1507:86965:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:particular periods. For example, we average each country’s entries over the period from 1500 to 
50:1508:87061:27:28:72:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:1801; and, we average values over the period from 1700 to 1950. These measures are provided in 
50:1509:87156:28:28:72:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:the worksheet titled “euro share.” Other researchers can obviously take these data and use 
50:1510:87247:28:27:72:296:598:144:Times:144:Times:whichever periods they find most appropriate. 
50:1511:87292:27:28:108:490:571:144:Times:144:Times:These simple, objective measures for computing the share of Europeans during 
50:1512:87369:28:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:colonization, however, have some limitations. Specifically, averaging over uniform time periods 
50:1513:87465:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:for all countries might not create accurate measures for each particular country of the proportion 
50:1514:87564:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:of the population that is European during a colony’s formative period—the period when a colony 
50:1515:87659:28:27:71:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:was creating an initial set of (potentially enduring) political, educational, and cultural 
50:1516:87750:27:28:71:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:institutions. We fully recognize that there is not a precise definition of “the” formative period of 
50:1517:87851:28:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:colonization. Nevertheless, influential studies of comparative economic development emphasize 
50:1518:87945:28:27:71:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:the potential role of Europeans during a colony’s history when it establishes major institutional 
50:1519:88043:27:28:71:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:norms. This motivates our efforts to give empirical substance to this amorphous notion.  From 
50:1520:88137:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:this perspective, using the European share of the population of Mexico in 1650 might be more 
50:1521:88230:27:28:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate than using the share in 1850, but using the European share of the population in 1650 
50:1522:88327:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (or other parts of the world) might be inappropriate because 
50:1523:88424:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:European colonization evolved differently there. Thus, we face a challenging goal: account for 
50:1524:88519:27:28:72:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:these historical differences in the timing and process of colonization to construct a more 
50:1525:88610:28:27:72:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:conceptually useful measure of “euro share” for each country. We face this challenge while 
50:1526:88701:27:28:72:268:157:144:Times:144:Times:operating under severe data constraints.  
50:1527:88742:28:28:108:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, the second method for constructing a measure of each country’s European share of 
50:1528:88829:28:0:72:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:the population during the formative years of colonization attempts to select the best year, or 
51:1529:88926:0:28:72:538:709:144:Times:144:Times:range of years, given the particulars of the country and data availability. We would like a date as 
51:1530:89026:28:27:72:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:early as possible after initial European colonization to use European settlement as an initial 
51:1531:89121:27:28:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:historical condition affecting subsequent developments. At the same time, we can’t pick a date 
51:1532:89216:28:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:that is too early after the start of European colonization. It was only after some process of 
51:1533:89310:28:27:72:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:conquest, disease control, and building rudimentary colonial infrastructure that it becomes 
51:1534:89402:27:28:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:possible to speak of a European community that might influence economic, political, and cultural 
51:1535:89499:28:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:conditions. Given these considerations, it would not make sense to use a uniform date across all 
51:1536:89596:28:27:72:120:515:144:Times:144:Times:colonies.  
51:1537:89607:27:28:108:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:Thus, we formulated the following “guidelines.” Subject to data limitations, we tried to 
51:1538:89696:28:27:72:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:constrain the timing of the European measure to be at least a century after initial European 
51:1539:89788:27:28:72:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:contact. Furthermore, we tried to choose a date that was at least 50 years before independence to 
51:1540:89886:28:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:measure the colonial period. Finally, if there were a few measures close together, we took the 
51:1541:89981:28:27:72:118:377:144:Times:144:Times:average.  
51:1542:89991:27:28:108:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:In the worksheet “euro share,” we provide a measure of each country’s European share of 
51:1543:90079:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:the population – euro share—that represents our assessment of the best year, or range of years, 
51:1544:90175:27:28:72:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:for measuring European share during the formative years of colonization for each particular 
51:1545:90267:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:country, where this assessment is almost always done subject to extreme data constraints. When 
51:1546:90362:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:using a range of years, we average to compute euro share. The worksheet also provides the year, 
51:1547:90458:27:28:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:or range of years, used to compute euro share. This second method is neither simple nor fully 
51:1548:90552:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:objective. Though we do our best to follow the guidelines outlined above, data limitations and 
51:1549:90647:27:28:72:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:the idiosyncrasies of colonial histories make things complex and subjective. Nevertheless, we 
51:1550:90741:28:0:72:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:believe euro share is a more accurate representation of the share of Europeans during the 
52:1551:90833:0:28:72:532:709:144:Times:144:Times:formative years of colonization that simply averaging over a uniform time period for all former 
52:1552:90929:28:27:72:117:681:144:Times:144:Times:colonies. 
52:1553:90938:27:28:108:518:654:144:Times:144:Times:Though the excel spreadsheet “euro share” provides the details for each country, it is 
52:1554:91025:28:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:valuable to illustrate some of the constraints that we face and the choices that we made. For 
52:1555:91119:28:27:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:much of Latin America, Angel Rosentblat (1954) provides detailed estimates of the composition 
52:1556:91213:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:of the population in 1650. We have used these estimates when available. In many countries, the 
52:1557:91308:28:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:next available observation is not until a century (or more) later. For example, after 1650, the next 
52:1558:91409:28:27:72:536:515:144:Times:144:Times:observation is not until 1798 in Brazil, 1940 in Bolivia, 1777 in Mexico, and 1744 in Argentina. 
52:1559:91506:27:28:72:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:For some of these countries, we have earlier population estimates that are reported in the excel 
52:1560:91603:28:27:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:file. For example, we have observations in 1570 for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Mexico. But, 
52:1561:91700:27:28:72:532:433:144:Times:144:Times:following the guidelines sketched above, we determined that this was too early after Europeans 
52:1562:91795:28:28:72:137:405:144:Times:144:Times:first arrived.  
52:1563:91810:28:27:108:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:There are other problems, some of which force us to break with the “guidelines” sketched 
52:1564:91899:27:28:72:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:above. For example, the first number that we have for the United States is the 1790 census, 
52:1565:91991:28:27:72:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:which is obviously not fifty years before the country became independent. Similarly, we do not 
52:1566:92086:27:28:72:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:have data on the composition of the population before 1950 for several countries in Africa, 
52:1567:92178:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, 
52:1568:92271:28:27:72:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:Tunisia, and Rwanda.  Jamaica and El Salvador provide some particular challenges. For Jamaica, 
52:1569:92366:27:28:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:the numbers on European share of the population show considerable variability over the period 
52:1570:92460:28:27:72:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:from 1570 to 1673; but then, the numbers (provided by various sources) are quite consistent from 
52:1571:92557:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:1700 through 1943. So, to compute euro share, we take the average over the period from 1700-
52:1572:92649:28:28:72:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:1750. For El Salvador, there is one extremely large observation in 1796 (0.48) that deviates from 
52:1573:92747:28:0:72:532:101:144:Times:144:Times:other estimates in nearby years (e.g., 0.03 in 1807) provided by the same source (Baron Castro, 
53:1574:92845:0:28:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:1942). Since (1) the estimates for euro share over the entire period with available data from 1551 
53:1575:92944:28:27:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:to 1950 are reasonably constant except for this one observation 1796 and (2) there seems to be a 
53:1576:93041:27:28:72:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:change in the definition of “white” for this particular year, we decided not to include this 
53:1577:93134:28:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:observation in the “euro share” worksheet. For El Salvador, therefore, we compute the average 
53:1578:93228:28:28:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:over the period from 1551-1807, excluding this 1796 outlier because of the change in definition. 
53:1579:93325:28:27:72:331:570:144:Times:144:Times:Data: Countries in which Europeans did not settle 
53:1580:93374:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times: There are many countries in which Europeans did not settle to any appreciable degree. In 
53:1581:93463:28:27:72:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:these countries, unsurprisingly, we do not find historical sources documenting the share of 
53:1582:93555:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans during the colonial period. Thus, we face a problem: We do not want eliminate these 
53:1583:93649:28:27:72:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:countries from the sample when we know that European settlers were not a material part of their 
53:1584:93745:27:28:72:540:433:144:Times:144:Times:history, but we do not have documentation to that effect. Thus, although we cannot strictly prove 
53:1585:93843:28:28:72:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:that there were no Europeans, available evidence suggests that Europeans did not settle 
53:1586:93931:28:27:72:412:377:144:Times:144:Times:everywhere and we can incorporate this information into our analyses. 
53:1587:94000:27:28:108:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:We follow the following procedure. We conduct a worldwide search for colonial data on 
53:1588:94086:28:27:72:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:European settlement. Besides the sources listed in the workbook, we examine many additional 
53:1589:94178:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:sources in search of data. When we fail to find any mention of European settlement in any of 
53:1590:94271:28:28:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:these sources for a given nation, we coded that country as having zero European settlement. This 
53:1591:94368:28:27:72:509:239:144:Times:144:Times:procedure runs the risk of biasing downward European settlement for these countries. But, 
53:1592:94458:27:28:72:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:colonial histories seem unlikely to ignore material European settlement. We confirm our data 
53:1593:94551:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:using information from Acemoglu et al. 2001 on the European share of the population in 1900.

54:1597:94646:0:27:72:348:708:144:Times:144:Times:Problems: A brief discussion of a few of the problems 
54:1598:94699:27:27:108:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:There are many challenges associated with constructing this database on the European 
54:1599:94784:27:28:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:share of the population during the period of colonization. First, although colonists did document 
54:1600:94882:28:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:the number of Europeans in the total population at various points during colonization, the 
54:1601:94973:28:27:72:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:processes and periodicities were not standardized. We just do not know if the same colonial 
54:1602:95065:27:28:72:540:571:144:Times:144:Times:power used the same methods in different countries in different years, not to mention differences 
54:1603:95163:28:28:72:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:across European powers. For example, different colonial powers probably used different 
54:1604:95250:28:27:72:488:515:144:Times:144:Times:methods to estimate population numbers. In a census-based method, there could be an 
54:1605:95334:27:28:71:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:undercount of non-European populations, which would bias population numbers downward and 
54:1606:95423:28:27:71:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:European shares upward. In a sampling methodology, there is zero expected bias only if the 
54:1607:95514:27:28:71:535:433:144:Times:144:Times:samplings were random. Unfortunately, we have almost no information on methods followed to 
54:1608:95605:28:28:71:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:get these population numbers. Put simply, we do not have a continuous time series of data 
54:1609:95695:28:27:71:407:377:144:Times:144:Times:collected using similar measures by a centralized coordinating entity. 
54:1610:95765:27:28:107:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:Second, most of the cells in the data running from the 16th century to the 20th century are 
54:1611:95857:28:27:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:empty. This means that for many countries we cannot get measures of the share of Europeans in 
54:1612:95951:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:the population within decades of the years that we would ideally want to measure euro share. 
54:1613:96044:28:27:72:506:267:144:Times:144:Times:Although most countries do not experience huge changes in the share of Europeans, some 
54:1614:96131:27:28:72:502:240:144:Times:144:Times:experience substantial changes, so this is another challenge facing the construction of the 
54:1615:96223:28:28:72:119:212:144:Times:144:Times:database. 
54:1616:96232:28:27:108:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:Third, the basic conceptual predictions about the role of Europeans during colonization 
54:1617:96320:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:and their enduring influence on economic development do not provide a concrete definition of 
54:1618:96413:28:27:72:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:when to measure the share of Europeans during colonization. We try to measure the share of 
54:1619:96504:27:0:72:532:102:144:Times:144:Times:Europeans about a century after the start of colonization and 50 years before independence, but 
55:1620:96602:0:28:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:this simply represents the articulation of a hopefully helpful empirical guideline to measure a still 
55:1621:96704:28:27:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:vague concept. Without ignoring these—and other—challenges, we constructed the database and 
55:1622:96796:27:28:71:528:654:144:Times:144:Times:use it to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between the share of Europeans during 
55:1623:96891:28:28:71:334:626:144:Times:144:Times:colonization and comparative economic development.
