2:33:1727:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:When competing firms possess overlapping sets of investors, maximizing shareholder value may 
2:34:1820:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:provide incentives  that  distort  competitive  behavior,  affecting  pricing,  entry,  contracting,  and 
2:35:1925:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:virtually all strategic interactions among firms. We propose a structurally consistent and scaleable 
2:36:2025:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:approach  to  the  measurement of  this  phenomenon  for  the  universe  of  S&P  500  firms  between 
2:37:2126:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:1980  and  2017.  Over  this  period,  the incentives  implied  by  the  common  ownership  hypothesis 
2:38:2228:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:have  grown  dramatically.  Contrary  to  popular intuition,  this  is  not  primarily  associated  with  the 
2:39:2337:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:rise of BlackRock and Van- guard: instead, the trend in the time series is driven by a broader rise 
2:40:2436:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:in diversified investment strategies, of which these firms are only the most recent incarnation. In 
2:41:2535:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:the cross-section, there is substantial variation that can be traced, both in the theory and the data, 
2:42:2637:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:to  observable  firm  characteristics  –  particularly  the  share  of  the  firm held  by  retail  investors. 
2:43:2747:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:Finally,   we   show   how   common   ownership   can   theoretically   give   rise   to   incentives for 
2:44:2852:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:C:expropriation  of  undiversified  shareholders  via  tunneling,  even  in  the  Berle  and  Means  (1932) 
2:45:2957:14:28:72:227:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:world of the “widely held firm.”

3:67:3421:0:47:72:185:704:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:68:3438:47:18:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Much  of  economics,  and  especially  the  study  of  firms,  is  predicated  on  the  assumption
3:69:3536:18:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  firms  maximize  profits.   Motivating  the  assumption,  Friedman  (1953)  contends  that
3:70:3632:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors  will  discipline  firms  that  do  not  at  least  mimic  profit-maximizing  behavior.   In-
3:71:3735:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vestor’s interests, however, may be complicated by investments in competing firms.  If firm
3:72:3826:18:17:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making is an expression of investor interests, and powerful investors have stakes in
3:73:3919:17:18:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competing firms, then we should expect the firm not to behave competitively, but instead
3:74:4007:18:18:72:539:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to put a nonzeroprofit weighton the competing firm’s profit when they make strategic deci-
3:75:4097:18:18:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sions.  This idea, that large, diversified owners imply nonzero profit weights among ostensibly
3:76:4192:18:35:72:349:514:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competing firms, is thecommon ownership hypothesis.
3:77:4243:35:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  theoretical  framework  of  the  common  ownership  hypothesis  was  first  articulated  in
3:78:4339:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rotemberg (1984), but it has recently become the subject of a lively public policy debate
3:79:4428:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thanks  to  empirical  work  suggesting  that  the  growth  of  large,  diversified  common  owners
3:80:4527:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may  have  caused  prices  to  increase  among  banks  and  airlines  (Azar  et  al.,  2016,  2018).
3:81:4627:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Contemporaneously,  Eekhout  and  De  Loecker  (2017)  argue  that  markups,  economy-wide,
3:82:4718:18:18:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have sharply increased since 1980, and list common ownership as a potential culprit.  This
3:83:4808:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:line of argument could go so far as to implicate common ownership in macro-level phenomena
3:84:4898:18:18:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as declining labor share and investment,  the productivity slowdown,  and diminished
3:85:4987:18:35:72:308:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“dynamism” (Guti ́errez and Philippon, 2016).
3:86:5032:35:17:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However appealing the explanation may initially be, there are myriad unanswered questions
3:87:5121:17:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  address  before  we  connect  common  ownership  to  the  rise  of  market  power  in  general.
3:88:5220:18:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper contributes to the literature on common ownership by laying out some of these
3:89:5308:18:18:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:issues,  including:   How  should  we  measure  common  ownership  in  the  economy  at  large?
3:90:5403:18:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Are  the  patterns  of  common  ownership  at  the  macro  level  economically  salient?   Where
3:91:5499:18:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should we expect these patterns to be stronger or weaker?  To address these questions, we
3:92:5588:18:18:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compute  the  implied  common  ownership  profit  weights  for  the  full  set  of  S&P  500  Index
3:93:5687:18:18:72:540:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constituents pairwise, from 1980 through the end of 2017.  Revisiting the math of common
3:94:5775:18:18:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership, we offer some simple insights on how the implied profit weights depend on investor
3:95:5868:18:18:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:concentration,  growing  adoption  of  diversified  investment  strategies,  as  well  as  some  very
3:96:5969:18:18:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular assumptions on the nature of corporate governance.  Guided by this, we are able
3:97:6059:18:18:72:540:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to show how each factor contributed to a staggering increase in implied common ownership
3:98:6147:18:0:72:540:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profit weights over the period, depicted on the Y axis in Figure 1.  For comparison:  a weight

4:100:6294:216:10:72:540:493:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:Notes:  This figure depicts the mean implied profit weight across all pairs of firms in the S&P 500 index by year, excluding own
4:101:6422:10:33:72:540:483:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:profit weights, which are normalized to 1.  See Section 2 for an explicit formula for common ownership weights and derivation.
4:102:6548:33:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 0 corresponds to what we expect in a world of profit-maximizing firms, and a weight of
4:103:6637:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 corresponds to the weight that a merged firm places on an acquired subsidiary businesses
4:104:6727:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(or, equivalently, full collusion).  We find that the average pairwise profit weights implied by
4:105:6823:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the common ownership hypothesis tripled among S&P 500 firms, from just over 0.2 in 1980
4:106:6910:18:35:72:183:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to almost 0.7 in 2017.
4:107:6932:35:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:An  interpretation  of  our  findings  is  that  the  macro-level  effects  are  large  enough  to  be
4:108:7034:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with the findings of Guti ́errez and Philippon (2016) and Eekhout and De Loecker
4:109:7125:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2017), a claim we explore through calibration of a simple Bertrand pricing model to the rise
4:110:7218:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in profit weights depicted in Figure 1.  Of course, this raises more questions for additional
4:111:7311:18:17:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research.  In particular, how should we go about testing whether these patterns of common
4:112:7400:17:18:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership do in fact translate to distortions in firm behavior, e.g.  higher prices?  In related
4:113:7496:18:18:72:540:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research we take this question up in the context of a specific market – the ready-to-eat cereal
4:114:7591:18:18:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:industry – and build on prior work on conduct testing in industrial organization (Backus

4:116:7783:18:18:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  end  of  measuring  the  economic  significance  and  patterns  of  common  ownership  in
4:117:7881:18:18:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  structurally  consistent  way,  exploring  the  empirical  implications  of  taking  the  common

5:125:8531:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pricing  is  the  relevant  strategic  game.   Its  use  has  been  a  source  of  controversy  in  the
5:126:8634:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common ownership literature for two reasons, and both are related to the fact that it conflates
5:127:8729:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common ownership incentives with market shares.  The first is its relationship to the now-
5:128:8819:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defunctstructure-conduct-performance(SCP) literature in industrial organization, and the
5:129:8907:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:econometric  problems  associated  with  treating  functions  of  market  share  as  independent
5:130:9003:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables.  We discuss and explore this concern in a companion piece (Backus et al., 2018b).
5:131:9095:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But second, the computation of market shares introduces a market definition problem, as
5:132:9182:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:well as a number of other measurement problems that are likely to bias any measure of time
5:133:9272:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trends.  For instance, foreign firms, like private firms, are unobserved in the Securities and
5:134:9366:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Exchange Commission (SEC) data used to construct such indices, but are growing in U.S.
5:135:9452:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market share during this period of rising trade flows.  Therefore we advocate a focus on the
5:136:9544:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:primitive of the common ownership hypothesis:  the implied profit weights that arise in the
5:137:9635:18:35:72:218:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firm’s optimization problem.
5:138:9663:35:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our focus on the primitive element of the common ownership problem, the profit weights,
5:139:9750:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affords us an opportunity to look more closely into the sources of the growth of common
5:140:9837:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership  incentives.   In  the  time  series,  we  show  that  this  is  driven  not  by  the  rise  of
5:141:9942:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:BlackRock and Vanguard, which have earned outsized mention in the literature, but instead
5:142:10031:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an older trend in increasing diversification of institutional portfolios that we trace back as
5:143:10125:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:far as 1980.  In the cross section, however, the story is rather different.  Both in the theory
5:144:10220:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the empirics, we show that the common ownership profit weights are strongly positively
5:145:10310:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with the proportion of shares held by retail investors, which has been declining
5:146:10401:18:35:72:127:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since 1980.
5:147:10412:35:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover,  we  observe  that  for  a  number  of  cases,  the  profit  weights  implied  by  common
5:148:10511:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership can exceed one. This would imply that the firm values a dollar of profits at another
5:149:10605:18:17:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firmmorethan a dollar of its own.  This is important because a profit weight greater than
5:150:10694:17:18:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one is the condition under which we might expect to see “tunneling,” a phenomenon typically
5:151:10785:18:18:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thought to arise only when control rights are explicitly divorced from cash flow rights, e.g.
5:152:10878:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when there are multiple classes of stock or a pyramid structure (Porta et al., 1999; Johnson
5:153:10970:18:18:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al., 2000).  This is not often thought to happen in the world of the Berle and Means (1932)
5:154:11064:18:18:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“widely-held firm,” the United States.  However, under the math of common ownership, the
5:155:11152:18:0:72:540:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential  for  the  phenomenon  arises  because  low  investor  concentration  effectively  dilutes
6:156:11253:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control rights, leaving the remaining few investors with disproportionately high influence.  In
6:157:11348:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, this is driven by holdings of retail investors, who do not exert the same influence
6:158:11443:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  corporate  governance  as  institutional  investors,  and  consistent  with  this  we  show  that
6:159:11544:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms with high retail shares (and, relatedly, large market capitalization) tend to place larger
6:160:11640:18:35:72:221:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profit weights on other firms.

6:162:11764:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:publicly  traded  firms.   While  most  research  to  date  in  this  area  has  used  a  commercial
6:163:11864:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dataset of these holdings (Thomson Reuters), it has been frequently noted that this dataset
6:164:11955:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has gaps in coverage and errors relative to the source documents.  As a result, we collected

6:174:12855:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some  yet-unexplored  mathematical  features  of  those  weights.   In  Section  3  we  offer  our

6:182:13526:18:18:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis of firm profit maximization, the profit function constitutes the objective function
6:183:13620:18:18:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the firm, and it is in this framework that economists have traditionally modeled behavior
6:184:13712:18:17:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ranging from pricing to entry to R&D. This is occasionally motivated by the claim that the

7:240:15457:18:0:72:185:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:useful to normalize by

7:243:15546:15:18:72:539:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to one, so thatκfgcan be interpreted as the relative value of a dollar of profits accruing to
7:244:15639:18:18:71:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firmgin firmf’s maximization problem.  In most competitive models (Cournot, Bertrand,
7:245:15724:18:17:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:etc.),  one assumes that firms ignore the rivals’ profits,  i.e.κfg= 0.  A large literature in
7:246:15818:17:0:71:539:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Industrial Organization treats mergers as changingkfg=kgf= 0→1 (see, e.g., Bresnahan
8:247:15903:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1987); Nevo (2001)).  Common ownership concerns can, in principle, rationalize anyκ≥0,
8:248:15990:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but  the  interesting  case  is  whenκfg>0,  and  the  firm  puts  positive  weight  on  its  rivals’
8:249:16091:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profits.   This  occurs  when  (γfs,βfs,βgs)>0,  in  other  words,  when  at  least  one  investor

8:252:16372:18:18:71:540:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The next question is:  Where do we obtain the information onγfsandβfsthat allows us to
8:253:16458:18:18:71:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:calculateκ?  For most publicly traded firms in the US, the cash flow rights of shareholders
8:254:16549:18:18:71:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in firmfare given by the fraction they own of total shares outstanding.  These quantities are
8:255:16642:18:18:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed for large institutional investors from mandatory 13(f) filings made every quarter
8:256:16732:18:18:71:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the SEC, discussed further in Section 3.1, and calculatingβfsusing this information is
8:257:16821:18:35:71:153:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straightforward.
8:258:16837:35:18:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The second element, the Pareto weight a firm places on each of its shareholders, sometimes
8:259:16927:18:18:71:539:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:called  thecontrol  weight,  is  less  transparent.   Any  formulation  ofγis  implicitly  a  model
8:260:17026:18:17:71:539:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  corporate  governance,  and  one  where  theory  offers  precious  little  guidance.   Absent  an
8:261:17127:17:18:71:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obvious alternative, much of the literature assumesγfs=βfs.  This assumption is sometimes
8:262:17216:18:18:71:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:motivated by intuitive appeals toproportional control—the “one share one vote” rule which
8:263:17305:18:18:71:539:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characterizes most publicly traded firms in the US. We caution that there is no formal link
8:264:17396:18:35:71:526:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between this parameterization and any micro-founded voting game that we are aware of.
8:265:17481:35:18:71:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  will  at  times  relax  the  proportional  control  assumption  and  allow  forγfs=f(βfs).
8:266:17575:18:18:71:540:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are two desirable properties that would like to retain: first, thatf(·) be monotonically
8:267:17669:18:18:71:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increasing and continuous in holdings, and second, thatf(0) = 0.4A convenient choice is
8:268:17756:18:18:71:539:280:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:f(βfs)∝(βfs)α,  which satisfies both.5By varyingαwe can modify the convexity of the
8:269:17839:18:18:71:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control weights, with a larger value ofαleading to more weight on the largest investors.  We
8:270:17931:18:18:71:485:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will show that most of our results are qualitatively insensitive to the choice ofα.
8:271:18014:18:15:85:539:226:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3It is difficult to rationalize the conventional model of own-profit maximization in this framework, in the
8:272:18121:15:12:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:presence of diversified investors.  Implicitly, one needs to motivate the assumption thatγfs= 0 for diversified
8:273:18232:12:9:72:285:199:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:investors, andγfs>0 for undiversified investors.
8:274:18280:9:15:85:539:190:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:4As an example where these features may fail, considerκin the case whereγ= 1 for all shareholders of
8:275:18380:15:12:72:539:175:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:firmf, i.e.  the firm maximizes their shareholder’s portfolio value.  This model introduces a potentially large
8:276:18491:12:8:72:467:163:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:discontinuity when a new investor with a large portfolio purchases a single share of a firm.
8:277:18583:8:17:85:539:155:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:5We write∝rather than = because we can always scale theS×1 vectorγ·sby a scalar because it appears
8:278:18681:17:0:71:351:138:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in both numerator and denominator ofκfg=〈γf,βg〉〈γf,βf〉=〈aγf,βg〉〈aγf,βf〉.

9:317:19828:18:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into two economically meaningful components.  First, it draws a clear link between investor
9:318:19919:18:18:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:concentration and profit weights or common ownership incentives.  Common ownership in-
9:319:20005:18:18:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centives are determined in part by relative concentration of investors.  If firmghas a large
9:320:20097:18:18:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(undiversified) investor thenIHHIgwill be large; if firmfhas many small investors then
9:321:20183:18:18:72:539:268:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:IHHIfwill be small.  All other things being equal, firms with concentrated investors will
9:322:20272:18:18:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:place more weight on their own profits, and less weight on competitor profits.  However, if a
9:323:20365:18:18:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diversified investor increases its positions in several firms at once, this may not change the

9:330:20658:18:18:71:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than  their  own).   Also,  because  it  is  a  quadratic  measure,IHHIshows  that  small  retail
9:331:20755:18:18:71:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors have a negligible contribution towardsIHHIand thusκ, which implies thatγ≈0

10:333:20923:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The second important and common term in (3) and (3’) is the cosine of the angle between the
10:334:21014:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positions which investors hold infand those which investors hold ing. So long as all investors
10:335:21108:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hold long positions in both (f,g) we have that cos(βf,βg)∈[0,1].  As the investor positions
10:336:21199:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:become more similar, the angle between those portfolios shrinks and cos(βf,βg)→1.  This
10:337:21286:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests  a  link  between  indexing  strategies,  e.g.   investing  in  the  “market  portfolio,”  and
10:338:21389:18:35:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common ownership incentives.  We explore this relationship further in our empirical results.
10:339:21481:35:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, a brief word on the term that appears in (3) but not (3’):  cos(βf,γf).  This corre-
10:340:21574:18:18:72:539:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sponds to the alignment of cash-flow rights and control rights within firmf. The proportional
10:341:21667:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control assumption aligns them perfectly, so it is equal to 1.  All else held equal, a weaker
10:342:21760:18:18:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relationship between the two will, since this term sits in the denominator, inflate common
10:343:21850:18:35:72:180:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership incentives.
10:344:21871:35:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The relationship between control rights and cash-flow rights is central to the common own-

10:348:22238:18:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nisms are different.  On the intensive margin, the issue is that the product of the two that
10:349:22330:18:18:72:539:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enters into the firm’s objective function.  Ifγfsis increasing inβfs, then this means that even
10:350:22425:18:18:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if my cash flow and control rights are linear, the marginal effect of additional investment by
10:351:22519:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shareholdersis increasing in their existing holdings.  Therefore, larger investors can have an
10:352:22613:18:18:72:539:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outsized effect in determining optimal actions.  Moreover, ifγfs→0 asβfs→0, then retail
10:353:22700:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors, who are assumed to be atomistic, drop out of the objective function of the firm
10:354:22790:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:altogether.  This is the extensive margin.  Since retail investors have no influence, it implies
10:355:22886:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the influence of institutional investors is magnified whenever the retail share is large,
10:356:22980:18:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in proportion to the inverse of the institutional share.  This will tend to magnify the respon-

11:389:24454:18:18:71:539:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factor here is the large retail share,  which at 60% corresponds to the average retail share

12:416:25417:18:18:71:539:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points about profit weights.  Notice that the profit weights do not depend directly onN.
12:417:25505:18:18:71:539:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lettingx= 1,  we have that an arbitrarily small share of ownership has led to monopoly
12:418:25591:18:18:71:539:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pricing.  Ifxis 2%, then the first firm will value $1 of the competitor’s profit as $2 of their
12:419:25686:18:18:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:own.  Therefore firm 1 would, if it could, divert profits directly to firm 2.  This raises concerns
12:420:25785:18:35:71:444:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:around tunneling (Johnson et al., 2000), which we discuss in Section 4.1.
12:421:25858:35:18:71:539:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can also re-interpret this problem by working backwards from the retail share.  Suppose
12:422:25948:18:18:71:539:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we  know  that  all  investors  are  symmetric  (holding  a  “market  portfolio”)  and  we  observe
12:423:26047:18:18:71:540:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the retail shares (r1,r2).  Thenκ12=1−r21−r1andκ21=1−r11−r2.  This suggests that as a firm’s
12:424:26139:18:18:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:retail  share  grows,  it  puts  a  higher  weight  on  competitor  profits.   Holding  all  else  equal,
12:425:26244:18:17:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this suggests that the growth of institutional investors may dampen (rather than enhance)

13:476:28176:35:18:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our approach represents an important departure not just from industry-specific studies of
13:477:28265:18:18:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common  ownership:  (Azar  et  al.,  2018,  2016),  but  also  broader  cross-industry  studies  of
13:478:28364:18:18:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common  ownership:   (Anton  et  al.,  2016;  Guti ́errez  and  Philippon,  2016)  which  rely  on
13:479:28462:18:18:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:MHHI.   In  order  to  computeMHHIwe  need  to  define  a  relevant  market  and  compute
13:480:28551:18:18:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appropriate market shares. Defining a relevant market is often the most contentious aspect of
13:481:28644:18:18:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:antitrust practice.  Prior studies often use 4-digit SIC codes as reported in Compustat.  These
13:482:28739:18:18:72:540:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may not represent appropriate product markets either in terms of geography or the nature
13:483:28827:18:18:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the products themselves.7If privately-held and foreign firms are present and unmeasured,
13:484:28918:18:18:72:539:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then  our  market  shares  will  be  incorrect.8If  the  unmeasured  share  of  privately-held  and

13:487:29201:9:0:85:539:78:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:8For example, in chocolate confections the four largest firms are:  Mondelez (formerly Kraft foods, owner

14:489:29401:18:35:72:461:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:residual share of publicly traded domestic firms appears more concentrated.

14:494:29771:47:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While there is broad agreement that common ownership is on the rise – under the premise
14:495:29858:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that there is growing concentration among highly diversified institutional investors – little

14:497:30040:18:35:72:503:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most exposed to common ownership?  And, what is it that drives the heterogeneity?
14:498:30121:35:18:72:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  compute  common  ownership  weights  (κvalues)  among  all  firms  in  the  S&P  500  for

14:507:30853:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mandatory.  These data are available to researchers through Wharton Research Data Services
14:508:30943:18:22:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(WRDS) and span the period from 1980-2017.  There are some documented data issues in

14:512:31238:8:16:85:539:134:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:9We  exclude  a  total  of  49  firms  for  using  dual-class  shares  throughout  our  sample.   These  tend  to  be
14:513:31355:16:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:relatively recent entrants, which is our sample falls somewhat more steeply below 500 constituents in later
14:514:31462:12:8:72:185:106:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:years, as seen in Figure 2.
14:515:31489:8:0:81:470:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:10The SEC publishes a quarterly list of 13(f) securities whose holdings must be reported.
15:516:31580:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the S34 database, particularly in later years.11We augment this ownership data by scraping
15:517:31670:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data ourselves from the SEC filings.  These data are available from 1999 onwards (when
15:518:31760:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the SEC started requiring electronic filing), though they are much more reliable beginning
15:519:31850:18:18:72:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in mid-2013 when the filings were required to be in XML format.12We also gather data on
15:520:31937:18:35:72:519:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices and shares outstanding from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).
15:521:32022:35:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We use our scraped data on 13(f) holdings from 2000 onwards, and the S34 database for filings
15:522:32115:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from 1980-1999.  We provide additional details on dataset construction and comparisons of
15:523:32204:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  two  databases  in  Appendix  B.   We  show  that  our  scraped  data  seem  to  have  better
15:524:32302:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coverage than the Thomson Reuters database from 1999-2017 in Figure 2.  Our sample of
15:525:32387:18:18:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:S&P 500 firms does not always include all 500 firms in each period.  Because of our focus
15:526:32476:18:18:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on profit weights that arise from overlapping investors, it is inappropriate to calculate these
15:527:32571:18:18:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from  financial  holdings  when  there  are  controlling  shareholders  or  multiple  share  classes.
15:528:32672:18:18:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore we exclude companies with controlling shareholders or special share classes with
15:529:32762:18:17:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enhanced (or no) voting rights, such as Alphabet (Google) or Facebook.13We also exclude
15:530:32849:17:35:72:524:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms where the US listing is an ADR of a stock primarily traded on a foreign exchange.
15:531:32936:35:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We also document the number of 13(f) Managers holding S&P 500 constituents in Figure
15:532:33020:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3.  The number of managers rises from around 500 in 1980 to around 4000 by 2017.  In part
15:533:33109:18:18:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this rise is driven by the fact that the reporting threshold of $100 million in 13(f) securities
15:534:33205:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is nominal rather than indexed to inflation.  Both the Thomson Reuters and our scraped
15:535:33291:18:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data indicate similar numbers of 13(f) managers.  We also compute the share of each firm
15:536:33379:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:owned by 13(f) managers and report the straight average over index constituents in Figure
15:537:33468:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:4.  This share has been rising from below 40% in 1980 to more than 80% by 2017, in part
15:538:33555:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:driven by the increasing number of 13(f) filers from Figure 3.  Around 2010, the Thomson
15:539:33643:18:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Reuters data indicates a sharp decline in the 13(f) share, while we observe no such decline
15:540:33734:18:16:81:539:243:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:11Recently, WRDS and some researchers (Ben-David et al. (2018)) noticed data quality issues regarding
15:541:33835:16:12:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the TR dataset, and they have worked to resolve these issues.  We use the July 2018 update provided by
15:542:33937:12:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:WRDS below.  We consolidate managers that report multiple subsidiaries.  Data quality issues are discussed
15:543:34043:12:8:72:331:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in more depth in Backus et al. (2018b) and in Appendix B.
15:544:34100:8:16:81:539:195:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:12A  highly  critical  report  from  the  SEC’s  Inspector  General  in  2010  noted  a  number  of  shortcomings
15:545:34213:16:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in  how  13(f)  filings  were  treated,  prompting  a  number  of  changes  to  13(f)  reporting.   See  Securities  and
15:546:34333:12:8:72:195:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of Inspector General (2010).
15:547:34361:8:16:81:539:159:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:13Occasionally,  these  controlling  shareholders  are  inside  or  retail  investors,  e.g.   the  Walton  family,  in
15:548:34480:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:violation of our theoretical assumption that retail investors are atomistic.  We have excluded known examples
15:549:34589:12:11:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:here, however it is possible to use data from SEC Forms 4,5, 6, and 144, available from the Thomson Reuters
15:550:34696:11:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Insider holdings database through WRDS, in order to construct industry holdings where available.  These
15:551:34799:12:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:data are impractical to clean for analysis at the aggregate level, however it is feasible and important to do so
15:552:34911:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:for case studies of particular industries as, e.g., Azar et al. (2018) do when they compute the profit weights
15:553:35021:12:0:72:121:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:for airlines.

16:557:35335:9:10:72:540:438:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:with multiple share classes unlikely to satisfy control assumptions.  The S&P 500 Index can contain fewer than 500 securities on

16:559:35590:9:24:72:508:419:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:classes of shares for the same company are included and deemed to count as one constituent (ie:  BRKA and BRKB).

17:566:36142:252:10:72:540:457:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:Notes:  This figure depicts the average total share of a firm that is owned by managers filing form 13(f).  This corresponds to
17:567:36269:10:9:72:540:447:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:the institutional ownership share of the firm, and one hundred minus this number corresponds to what we are calling the retail
17:568:36395:9:34:72:427:438:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:share.  We report the straight average across index constituents rather than a weighted average.
17:569:36491:34:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  document  a  number  of  additional  discrepancies  between  our  scraped  dataset  and  the
17:570:36587:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thomson Reuters S34 dataset in Appendix B.  In particular, Appendix Figure 17 shows the
17:571:36674:18:17:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of the number of owners reported for S&P 500 constituents over time in the TR
17:572:36764:17:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dataset, as well as our scraped and parsed sample.  In TR, up to 10% of firms have fewer
17:573:36852:18:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than  50  reported  shareholders  in  some  periods,  while  in  our  data,  the  numbers  are  more
17:574:36952:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consistent  over  time.   To  further  highlight  this  coverage  issue,  Appendix  Figure  18  shows
17:575:37053:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:how much of the ownership of three particular,  large firms is reported in the TR dataset
17:576:37142:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:versus what we find in our dataset.  There is an inexplicable drop in reported ownership in
17:577:37233:18:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the TR data, while our dataset produces a smooth series for each firm.  Finally, Appendix
17:578:37322:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 19 shows that if one were to create Figure 1 using only the TR dataset, one would
17:579:37410:18:52:72:535:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:get a very different time-series, with average profit weights doubling in some time periods.

17:581:37535:42:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 1, we saw that under the assumption of proportional control,γ=β, there is a stark
17:582:37626:18:18:72:539:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive trend in common ownership incentives (κ) among S&P 500 firms, growing from an
17:583:37712:18:18:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average of 0.2 to 0.7 between 1980 and 2018.  Figure 5 plots the averageκfor every pair of

18:588:38153:18:18:71:539:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors  in  firmf.   We  see  that  the  increasing  trend  is  relatively  robust  to  assumptions
18:589:38255:18:18:71:540:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:about corporate control, and that toward the end of the sample (2012-2017), the averageκ
18:590:38343:18:35:71:376:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profit weight does not appear to depend on our choice ofγ.
18:591:38401:35:17:71:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Perhaps contrary to expectations, as we increaseα, the average weightκthat a firm places
18:592:38489:17:18:71:539:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on its competitors’ profitsdecreases.  Toward the very end of the sample this relationship
18:593:38579:18:35:71:456:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inverts, though differences among average profit weights become negligible.
18:594:38654:35:18:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These  results  challenge  some  previously  held  assumptions  regarding  common  ownership.
18:595:38747:18:18:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If  common  ownership  effects  were  driven  entirely  by  the  rise  of  the  largest  institutional
18:596:38849:18:18:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors, we would expect the profit weights to be more sensitive to different assumptions
18:597:38940:18:18:71:539:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about  effective  controlγ.   Instead,  we  find  that  for  most  of  the  sample,  more  weight  on
18:598:39041:18:18:71:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large investors acts to reduce rather than increaseκ.  The second is that while we know very
18:599:39133:18:18:71:539:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:little about how ownership translates into control, in recent years average profit weights are
18:600:39227:18:35:71:381:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively insensitive to a wide range of control assumptions.
18:601:39289:35:18:71:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While  ourγfs∝βαfsparameterization  is  convenient,  our  choice  ofα∈ {12,1,2,3}is  not
18:602:39377:18:18:71:540:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:obviously interpretable, other than that larger values ofαplace more weight on the largest
18:603:39467:18:0:71:540:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders.  In order to quantify the effects ofαon effective control, we calculate a concen-

19:610:39732:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sure resembles an HHI, we can compute theequivalent number of symmetric controllersas

19:612:39829:35:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 6,  we report our concentration measures for effective control which we multiply
19:613:39919:18:18:72:539:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by  10,000  as  is  common  in  the  antitrust  literature.   Under  proportional  controlα=  1,
19:614:40015:18:18:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:CHHI=IHHI,  so that a typical firm had the equivalent of 65 symmetric “controllers”

19:616:40174:18:18:71:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As we increaseα, we place more weight on a small number of larger investors.  For example

19:620:40521:18:51:71:414:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this suggests we have considered the range of relevant values forα.

19:622:40644:43:18:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Discussions  of  common  ownership  are  often  linked  to  the  rise  in  concentration  among  a

19:628:41210:17:18:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2000; combined, the “Big Three” owned approximately 6% of the average firm in 2000, and
19:629:41297:18:18:71:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:21% percent of the average S&P 500 firm by the end of 2017.  While this rise is staggering,
19:630:41388:18:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1 indicates that much of the rise in common ownership incentives predates it; indeed

21:672:43631:18:18:71:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:at all.  For example, the DOJ and FTC considerproduct marketsto behighly concentrated

22:675:43885:18:35:72:308:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets are appropriate to apply to investors.
22:676:43931:35:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We might ask, what has driven the rise inIHHIover time?  As we showed in Section 2.2,
22:677:44016:18:18:71:539:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theIHHIfis  related  to11−rfwhererfis  the  “retail  share”  of  firmf(ie:  the  fraction of

22:679:44216:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share (Figure 4) has fallen from around 60% in 1980 to around 20% today.  Thus part of this
22:680:44307:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trend is about 13(f) filers taking larger positions, such as the rise of the “Big Three”, while
22:681:44402:18:35:72:310:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:part is driven by the rise in 13(f) filers overall.

22:687:44653:14:18:72:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend on relative investor concentration.  Holding all else equal, as firmf’s own investors

23:715:46157:252:10:72:540:457:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:Notes:  We report average similarity measures across all pairs of firms in each period.  Note that similarity here is across firms

23:717:46384:34:18:72:539:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:One potential criticism ofL2measures of similarity is that they put additional weight on the
23:718:46476:18:18:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:largest investors, and may therefore conflate investor similarity and investor concentration.
23:719:46569:18:18:72:539:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To better get at investor similarity directly, we can construct anL1measure.  The core of
23:720:46658:18:0:72:147:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this measure is

23:722:46674:13:14:162:539:355:8:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:A:s|βfs−βgs|.  It is smallest when all investors hold the same fraction of both
23:723:46751:14:18:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms (f,g) so thatβfs=βgs.  Assuming no short positions are allowed, it is largest when
23:724:46839:18:18:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors hold either a position in firmfor in firmg, and thus are not common owners.  We
23:725:46928:18:34:72:389:305:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:construct aL1measure of similarity which varies from [0,1]:20

23:732:47026:39:18:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is not our preferred measure, as it does not correspond to a profit weight of an objective
23:733:47121:18:18:72:539:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function, but it may help us quantify the extent to which firms (f,g) have owners in common.
23:734:47213:18:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 9 we explore this relationship, we find that the average (across pairs of firms) cosine

24:774:49678:8:16:81:539:101:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:22We should point out that our analysis is at the investor/manager level from 13(f) filings not at the level

25:782:50268:18:18:71:539:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:driven  by  a  broad  trend  towards  indexing  among  asset  managers.   This  contrasts  what
25:783:50363:18:18:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be the developing narrative that common ownership is largely a function of rising
25:784:50455:18:18:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investor  concentration  particularly  among  the  “Big  Three”  (as  discussed  in  the  previous

25:787:50601:42:18:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:An  obvious  criticism  of  the  above  economy-wide  analysis  is  that  a  pharmaceutical  firm’s
25:788:50700:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decisions hardly affect the profits of an airline, so why do these profit weights tell us anything?
25:789:50799:18:18:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:What are profit weights within relevant product markets?  Answering this question requires
25:790:50889:18:35:71:478:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:us to make assumptions about market definition, which we have avoided so far.
25:791:50966:35:18:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here  we  follow  the  literature  and  adopt,  perhaps  unsatisfyingly,  four-digit  SIC  codes  as

25:794:51237:18:18:71:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are often criticized, it would be problematic if the overall trends we document did not hold
25:795:51329:18:18:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under this restriction.  Figure 11 shows the results:  the overall trend is the same, and the
25:796:51422:18:34:71:252:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level is, if anything, slightly higher.
25:797:51461:34:18:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Next,  we  present  the  average  profit  weight  for  a  pair  of  specific  industries:   commercial

28:824:53669:18:35:72:466:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is to focus on cross-sectional variation in profit weights within a time period.
28:825:53749:35:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  find  a  stark  relationship:   Large  market  cap  firms  tend  to  have  substantially  higher
28:826:53849:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common  ownership  weights  for  other  firms.   We  hypothesize  that  this  is  related  to  retail
28:827:53950:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share.  In the common ownership framework,  retail investors are infinitesimally small and
28:828:54040:18:18:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore do not exercise any control over the firm.  Large aggregate retail share then tends
28:829:54133:18:18:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to inflate the control rights associated with institutional ownership.  As we showed in Section
28:830:54228:18:18:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2.2, with symmetric investor holdings we expectκfg∝11−rf, whererfis the retail share of

28:832:54410:18:34:72:469:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with common ownership weights and appears proportional to11−rf.
28:833:54484:34:18:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can now put together both the time series evidence from sections 3.3 and 3.4 with the

28:837:54837:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investor indexing behavior.  For the market-level variable, in each quarter we compute our
28:838:54927:18:18:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:L2(cosine similarity) measure between each investor’s portfolio and the “market portfolio”
28:839:55017:18:18:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and then take an AUM weighted average as we do in Section 3.4 and Figure 10.  We also
28:840:55102:18:18:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:construct a firm-level measure of how “indexed” a particular firms investors are by taking

30:876:56941:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:4, retail share is sharply declining between 1980 and 2017, from an average of approximately
30:877:57033:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:65% to 20%.  Here we have identified this relationship off of the cross-section alone, and if
30:878:57126:18:35:72:502:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anything, in the time series it has worked to dampen common ownership incentives.
30:879:57207:35:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We find a strong relationship between our firm-level measure of “indexing” behavior and our

30:881:57391:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more similar to the index, we expect an equivalent rise in the profit weights that firmfplaces

30:886:57837:18:18:71:539:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time, looking just at the last quarter of 2017, the range between the top and bottom

30:894:58379:42:18:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Following the language of Johnson et al. (2000), “tunneling” is the practice of transferring
30:895:58471:18:18:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profits,  whether  via  acquisition,  mispriced  purchase  orders,  or  direct  transfer,  from  one
30:896:58571:18:18:71:539:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:company to another in order to benefit the interests of a controlling stakeholder in both,
30:897:58661:18:18:71:539:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defrauding both creditors and minority shareholders in the former firm. The above-referenced
30:898:58753:18:18:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paper offers anecdotal evidence of tunneling even in developed countries, particularly civil
30:899:58845:18:18:71:539:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:law countries, and other work has found evidence in the developed world (Bertrand et al.,
30:900:58934:18:18:71:539:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2002).   However  it  is  not  typically  believed  to  occur  in  the  US,  for  two  reasons:   strong
30:901:59038:18:18:71:539:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investor  protections  that  facilitate  healthy  financial  markets  (Porta  et  al.,  1999)  and  the
30:902:59141:18:18:71:539:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:near-universal absence of a controlling interest in publicly-traded firms; the US is the land
30:903:59234:18:0:71:332:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the “widely-held” firm (Berle and Means, 1932).

31:906:59458:35:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The connection between common ownership and tunneling hinges on this second point.  If
31:907:59544:18:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the common ownership hypothesis maintains:  (1) owners are sufficiently diversified and
31:908:59634:18:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2) firms care about the effects of their decisions the entirety of their shareholders portfolios;
31:909:59732:18:17:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then firms may have an incentive to engage in tunneling even in the absence of a controlling
31:910:59824:17:18:72:539:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest.  On this point we can be precise:  ifκfg>1 then firmfwould, if it could, transfer
31:911:59915:18:35:72:199:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:profits directly to firmg.
31:912:59941:35:18:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 14,  we report the share of firm pairs for whichκfg>1 under the proportional
31:913:60027:18:18:72:539:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control assumption.  Recall that, from equation (3’), sincecos(βf,βg) is bounded above by
31:914:60116:18:18:72:539:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1,κfg>1 implies thatκgf<1 – i.e., that tunneling is in the interest of both firms.  Be-
31:915:60203:18:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cause tunneling is necessarily unidirectional, the maximum amount of tunneling relationships
31:916:60295:18:18:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would be 50%.  Therefore,  twice the number described in the figure yields the fraction of
31:917:60385:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pairwise relationships among S&P 500 firms in which parties have an incentive to engage in
31:918:60475:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tunneling.  We find a striking rise in this frequency between 1993 and 2002, and again in the
31:919:60568:18:35:72:185:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period following 2015.
31:920:60590:35:18:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There  is  a  meaningful  difference  between  the  patterns  of  tunneling  predicted  by  common
31:921:60688:18:18:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership and the prior literature.  Whereas before, the key element was control rights, it
31:922:60779:18:18:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tended to be isolated within groups of firms that had a common controlling interest.  For
31:923:60868:18:0:72:540:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, Bertrand et al. (2002) offer econometric evidence of tunneling about documented
32:924:60958:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business groups in India.  There the pattern of tunneling interest issparse—firms possess few
32:925:61051:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tunneling “targets”.  Tunneling arising from common ownership is driven patterns of retail

32:930:61235:14:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“targets”.  This suggests that the resulting patterns of tunneling will tend to be dense rather
32:931:61330:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than sparse—firms which have incentives to engage in tunneling may want to tunnel funds
32:932:61417:18:35:72:164:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to many partners.
32:933:61434:35:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Taken at  face value,  the finding implies that in the world of the widely-held firm,  i.e.  in
32:934:61529:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the absence of a controlling interest, the incentives for tunneling may be pervasive if firm
32:935:61621:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives  reflect  common  ownership  concerns.   It  is  worth  emphasizing  that,  unlike  our
32:936:61719:18:18:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results  in  Section  3,  in  the  later  periods,  the  result  depends  heavily  on  our  assumptions
32:937:61822:18:18:72:540:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about control rights.  We document this in Appendix Section C.3.  Moreover, in the presence
32:938:61913:18:51:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of strong minority shareholder protections, these incentives may not translate into behavior.

32:941:62137:18:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:61% in 2017 across a broad range of publicly traded firms.  We conduct a simple calibration

33:965:63225:35:18:72:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We calibrate parameters as follows.  First we setc= 1 without loss of generality.  This means
33:966:63318:18:18:71:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  prices  and  markups  are  one  in  the  same:   ˆp(κ)  =μ.   Next  we  choose  the  number  of

35:1040:67907:43:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:An objection that has been raised to the literature on common ownership is that many large
35:1041:67997:18:17:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:institutional owners do not have full discretion in voting the shares that they control.  To the
35:1042:68093:17:18:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extent that the Pareto weightsγfrepresent control rights that derive from a voting game,
35:1043:68181:18:35:72:473:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this would cause us to potentially over-represent common ownership concerns.
35:1044:68257:35:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Fortunately, the 13(f) filings require investors to report not only total share holdings, but to
35:1045:68353:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:divide these among “sole”, “shared”, and “no” voting authority shares.  Therefore, to show

35:1047:68534:18:18:72:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under the assumption of proportional control (γfs=βfs) where we limit attention to either
35:1048:68623:18:18:71:539:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“sole”  and  “shared”  voting  authority  shares,  or  only  “sole”  voting  authority  shares.   We

35:1050:68825:18:12:81:231:155:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:30For example:  linear, convex, etc.
35:1051:68861:12:15:81:539:143:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:31We also caution against normalizing theGGLfgmeasure and interpreting it as aprofit weightunder any
35:1052:68961:15:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:circumstances.  Consider the case of the breakfast cereal industry:  Kellogg’s has a market cap of $21 Billion
35:1053:69071:12:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and derives most of its revenue from its breakfast cereal business.  Pepsi has a market cap of $165 Billion,
35:1054:69179:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and derives only a small fraction of its revenue from its breakfast cereal business (Quaker Oats).  An investor
35:1055:69290:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:holding the S&P 500 index would then value $1 of profits 8×as much for Pepsi as it would for Kellogg’s
35:1056:69392:12:0:72:305:80:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:even though they own the same fraction of each firm.

37:1066:70176:0:47:72:173:704:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
37:1067:70191:47:18:72:540:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This  paper  has  endeavored  to  take  the  common  ownership  hypothesis  seriously  and  work
37:1068:70287:18:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through  the  economic  implications  at  a  macro  level,  taking  the  universe  of  firms  in  the
37:1069:70388:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:S&P 500 from 1980 do 2017.  This began with a data challenge, and so in addition to the
37:1070:70475:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sources already exploited by the literature, we manually recompiled investor holdings from
37:1071:70565:18:17:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:13(f) reports downloaded from the SEC. We are making the source code for this compilation
37:1072:70654:17:35:72:508:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available for future researchers.  From the exercise can draw a number of conclusions.
37:1073:70740:35:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:First,  the  implied  common  ownership  incentives  have  risen  substantially  over  the  period,
37:1074:70839:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more than tripling from an average of 0.2 in 1980 to almost 0.7 in 2017.  This rise is econom-
37:1075:70933:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically significant.  A simple calibration exercise suggests that much of the rise in markups
37:1076:71025:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed in Eekhout and De Loecker (2017) could, in principle, be explained through this
37:1077:71113:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:channel, however a closer look suggests that the rise in common ownership incentives tends
37:1078:71203:18:35:72:285:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to substantially lag their rise in markups.
37:1079:71246:35:18:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second,  even though large index funds such as BlackRock and Vanguard have dominated
37:1080:71330:18:18:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  public  debate  on  common  ownership,  much  of  the  historic  rise  in  common  ownership
37:1081:71427:18:18:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives predates them, and is driven not by concentration in asset management but rather
37:1082:71518:18:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by a broader increase in diversification of investor portfolios.  Indeed,  the growth of these
37:1083:71612:18:35:72:430:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms has an ambiguous relationship to common ownership incentives.
37:1084:71679:35:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Third, we find a strong relationship between common ownership and retail share.  We see this
37:1085:71771:18:17:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both in the theory, by decomposing the common ownership profit weights, as well as in the
37:1086:71860:17:18:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cross-sectional variation of common ownership weights between firms.  A large retail share
37:1087:71950:18:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tends to inflate common ownership incentives by giving outsized control rights to a small
37:1088:72039:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set of large, diversified institutional investors.  In extreme cases, which are becoming more
37:1089:72132:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:common, this can even yield profit weights that exceed one.  This is a necessary condition
37:1090:72222:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for “tunneling,” and overturns the traditional defense of the “widely held firm,” that in the
37:1091:72315:18:35:72:432:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:absence of a controlling interest, investors are safe from expropriation.
37:1092:72388:35:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It is important to emphasize that the goal here has not been to explicitly test the common
37:1093:72478:18:18:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ownership hypothesis, but rather to articulate its implications in order to better form the
37:1094:72569:18:18:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy debate that is already underway.  There is much more work to be done and we believe
37:1095:72659:18:0:72:540:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that there are two important areas for future research in particular.  The first is a forensic

43:1311:81259:18:18:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:database.  For 2000-2017, we use our own proprietary dataset, for which we are making the
43:1312:81348:18:18:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:code publibly available, based on scraped and parsed source documents from the SEC. The

43:1314:81485:34:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For many filings there are multiple filing dates (fdate) for the same report date (rdate).  This

43:1316:81673:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the case of a stock split.  For an ordinary revision, e.g.  in case of error, we would like to take
43:1317:81772:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the last fdate for each rdate.  However, revisions following a stock split are often retroactively
44:1318:81872:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applied to report dates prior to the split event itself, and in these cases we want to use the
44:1319:81966:18:35:72:338:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first filing date.  This is a frequent issue in the data.

44:1324:82302:35:18:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In addition,  there is a notable exception:  in several instances BlackRock holdings appear
44:1325:82393:18:18:72:540:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  conflate  the  two  dates,  and  so  for  BlackRock  we  use  the  filing  date  exclusively.   This
44:1326:82497:18:18:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resolves the otherwise inexplicable disappearance of BlackRock Inc.  from the s34 in 2010q2
44:1327:82588:18:35:72:133:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 2010q3.
44:1328:82599:35:18:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:13(f) filings use investor-reported values and tallies of shares outstanding and these frequently
44:1329:82696:18:18:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contain errors, so we use the CRSP monthly database, merged on contemporaneous CUSIP
44:1330:82780:18:35:72:291:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:codes (nCUSIP), to compute these figures.
44:1331:82821:35:34:72:457:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:From CRSP we also obtain historical data on membership in the S&P 500.
44:1332:82891:34:18:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:From Compustat we obtain additional fields:  Aggregate short interest for each member firm
44:1333:82981:18:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by  quarter,  and  the  number  of  business  segments,  as  reported  in  the  Compustat  (North
44:1334:83078:18:18:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:America) Database.  There are two limitations of this data.  First, coverage is imperfect.  Of
44:1335:83172:18:18:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 1,587 firms that ever appear in the S&P 500 between 1980 and 2017, we lack data on
44:1336:83258:18:18:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:business segments for 209 of them.  Second, the data are self-reported.  What constitutes a
44:1337:83349:18:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“business segment” is an ill-defined notion, and may vary from firm to firm.  Moreover, as
44:1338:83439:18:18:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggested by [where’s that citation again], there may be incentives for strategic misreporting
44:1339:83533:18:52:72:97:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:here.
44:1340:83538:52:42:72:222:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B.2    Alternative Dataset
44:1341:83564:42:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Given our concerns with the Thomson Reuters dataset,  as well as the concerns voiced by
44:1342:83651:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:others  such  as  WRDS  and  Ben-David  et  al.  (2018),  we  also  recreated  a  dataset  of  13(f)
44:1343:83751:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holdings  directly  from  the  source  filings.   This  involved  gathering  approximately  25GB  of
44:1344:83851:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:13(f) filings from the SEC, for the time period 1999-2017.  (Mandatory electronic filing of
44:1345:83942:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:13(f) forms began in 1999; for earlier years, coverage is poor.)  These files are then parsed
45:1346:84037:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to extract holdings of S&P 500 firms.  The parsing is handled slightly differently for filings
45:1347:84131:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:made before the third quarter of 2013, as starting then, the SEC mandated an XML filing
45:1348:84218:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:format.   The  code  is  written  in  Perl  and  uses  regular  expressions  to  match  text  patterns
45:1349:84320:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding to holdings.  The code is freely available from the authors.  Note that we do
45:1350:84411:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not claim that every single one of the nearly 19M observations in our scraped and parsed
45:1351:84499:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample are correct;  we have a number of examples of filings that are so irregular as to be
45:1352:84590:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:un-parsable.  However, we believe this alternative dataset does capture many filings missing
45:1353:84682:18:51:72:496:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from Thomson Reuters, and is more consistent over time in a number of measures.

45:1355:84785:43:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In these filings (covering January 31, 1999 through June 30, 2013), most reports are fixed-
45:1356:84876:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:width tables of holding name, holding CUSIP, value, number of shares, and then a possible
45:1357:84965:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:breakout of shares by voting rights.  For each file, our code first extracts the reporting date,
45:1358:85061:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:filing date, CIK of the filing firm, and form type from the filing header.  The code then looks
45:1359:85156:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for any line of text that contains an S&P 500 CUSIP for that form’s reporting period.  As
45:1360:85245:18:17:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms on occasion report derivative holdings for a CUSIP, we drop any records that match
45:1361:85333:17:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any of the following words (case insensitive, with word boundaries on both sides):  put, call,
45:1362:85427:18:18:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conv  bd,  conv  bond,  opt.   The  code  then  attempts  to  match  a  pattern  that  is  consistent
45:1363:85528:18:18:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with most filings:  a CUSIP, followed by a value, followed by a number of shares.  As filings
45:1364:85621:18:18:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are far from uniform, the code also attempts to correct a number of common problems:  for
45:1365:85710:18:18:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, in some cases there is no space in between the value and the number of shares; the
45:1366:85801:18:18:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:code attempts to discern the correct breakdown based on the price and shares outstanding
45:1367:85889:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for that holding in that quarter, as reported by CRSP. The code then outputs a list of share
45:1368:85981:18:51:72:321:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:holdings at the CIK-CUSIP-reporting date level.
45:1369:86028:51:43:72:195:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B.2.2    XML Parsing
45:1370:86048:43:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For filings beginning in the third quarter of 2013, our code exploits the XML structure when
45:1371:86140:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parsing  for  filings.   As  before,  we  first  extract  the  reporting  date,  filing  date,  CIK  of  the
45:1372:86248:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:filing firm, and form type from the filing header.  We then separate the file into “infotable”
45:1373:86342:18:18:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:XML objects.  We keep all such objects that have a CUSIP element that contains an S&P
45:1374:86427:18:18:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:500 CUSIP for that form’s reporting date.  We further drop any records that have a “put”
45:1375:86515:18:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or “call” element, or a “principal amount” element.  We finally drop any where the title of
46:1376:86608:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:class  contains  “put”  or  “call”  surrounded  by  word  boundaries,  or  that  begins  with  “opt”
46:1377:86708:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or  “war”  (all  case  insensitive).   The  code  also  extracts  the  reported  value  from  the  value
46:1378:86812:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:element of the information table, and compares that to the extracted number of shares times
46:1379:86903:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the CRSP-reported price at the reporting date.  If the two values differ by less than 10%,
46:1380:86993:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we also include a flag in the output that the data appear valid (we use this when there are
46:1381:87084:18:52:72:346:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple filings per reporting date for a CIK-CUSIP).
46:1382:87137:52:42:72:202:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B.2.3    Final Cleaning
46:1383:87160:42:18:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We take the output of the parsing steps above and obtain a dataset of institutional holdings.
46:1384:87253:18:18:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the case of restated filings, we keep the initial filing unless the reported value and number
46:1385:87349:18:18:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of shares appears impossible, in which case we keep the first rational report filed within 90
46:1386:87442:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:days of the mandatory reporting date.  We consolidate all BlackRock entities into the same
46:1387:87532:18:18:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entity and collapse their holdings (while the argument could be made for collapsing other
46:1388:87621:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment management firms’ sub-entities, we solely do this for BlackRock given the practice
46:1389:87714:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the literature).  Finally, we drop 331 observations where the reported shareholdings are
46:1390:87805:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:greater than 50% of shares outstanding.  Some of these observations are correct: for example,
46:1391:87898:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Loews Corporation,  an S&P 500 component,  controlled more than 50% of common stock
46:1392:87981:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of Diamond Offshore Drilling, another S&P 500 component, from 2009-2016.  Other records
46:1393:88068:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:among  these  331  observations  appear  to  be  either  parsing  errors  or  raw  data  errors.   For
46:1394:88170:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, in 2014, Guardian Life (CIK: 901849) reported holdings in Noble Corp (CUSIP:
46:1395:88255:18:17:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:G6543110) of over 144 billion shares valued at $144 billion dollars,  while Noble Corp had
46:1396:88345:17:18:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a just over 250M shares outstanding and a market capitalization of $5.6B.33The result is
46:1397:88433:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a dataset of 18,968,596 observations of unique CIK-CUSIP-record date holdings across 75

46:1400:88577:43:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We do two primary comparisons against the Thomson Reuters (TR) dataset,  followed by
46:1401:88661:18:17:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  deep-dive  on  some  particular  holdings  where  the  TR dataset seems  deficient.   First,  we
46:1402:88760:17:19:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider the number of 13(f) owners per S&P 500 firm.  Second, we consider the number of

47:1406:89074:18:35:72:470:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indicate the TR data with solid lines and our scraped data with dashed lines.
47:1407:89151:35:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 17 plots the mean, median, 10th percentile, and minimum of the number of owners
47:1408:89237:18:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of S&P 500 firms over time.  Solid lines are the TR data, dashed are the scraped data.  As
47:1409:89327:18:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is clear, there appears to be an issue in the TR data where some firms show few owners, as
47:1410:89417:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidenced by the ”min” line.  In addition, the “10th percentile” line shows that there is a
47:1411:89508:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:series of quarters beginning in 2011 where over 10% of S&P 500 firms have very few reported
47:1412:89599:18:24:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:owners.  In contrast, the dashed lines show more consistent patterns in the scraped data.

47:1414:89715:253:9:72:540:288:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:Notes:  This figure depicts statistics of the number of investment managers per issue in the S&P 500 over time.  The TR data
47:1415:89839:9:29:72:494:279:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:uses ”mgrno”, manager number, as a manager while the scraped data uses the SEC’s CIK number for a manager.
47:1416:89945:29:18:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 2 presents these data in a different way: for each quarter, it plots the number of single-
47:1417:90042:18:18:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:class of share firms held by 13(f) managers in the respective datasets, limited to issuances
47:1418:90134:18:18:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:held by at least 100 investment managers.  Note that this should be below 500 as we omit
47:1419:90222:18:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:firms with multiple classes of shares.  As is immediately clear, there is an issue with the TR
47:1420:90316:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dataset beginning in 2011.  If a firm appears to have very few owners, this directly impacts

47:1425:90739:17:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three major firms:  Alcoa, Xerox, and Coach in the TR dataset.  The solid lines show that
48:1426:90830:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prior 2011, 13(f) investment firms held between 60% and 90% of these firms.  However, in
48:1427:90918:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2011, that falls dramatically to under 10%, before reverting back in 2013 for one of the three

48:1432:91281:253:10:72:540:358:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:Notes:  This figure sums the holdings of all 13(f) managers for three firms:  Alcoa (permno:  24643, CUSIP: 03965L10), Xerox
48:1433:91405:10:9:72:540:348:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:(permno:  27983, CUSIP: 98412110), and Coach (permno:  88661, CUSIP: 87603010).  TR data series are plotted solid lines, the
48:1434:91529:9:30:72:255:339:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:authors’ scraped and parsed data in dashed lines.
48:1435:91578:30:18:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To summarize the issue with the Thomson Reuters dataset, Appendix Figure 19 shows what
48:1436:91664:18:18:72:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the average computed profit weights (theκvalues) would be using the raw Thomson Reuters
48:1437:91751:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data in solid lines, and our new dataset in dashed lines.  As is clear, the Thomson Reuters
48:1438:91842:18:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dataset has coverage deficiencies in several years that result in large swings of the average
48:1439:91935:18:51:72:365:237:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:κ, even reaching improbably high values starting in 2010.
48:1440:91992:51:43:72:203:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B.2.5    Airline Sample
48:1441:92015:43:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Most airlines are not S&P 500 constituents during this time period (one notable exception
48:1442:92104:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is Southwest Airlines).  Therefore, we began by assembling a set of CUSIPs for airlines from
48:1443:92196:18:18:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:CRSP and arrived at a set that consisted of major airlines (excluding foreign and regional).
48:1444:92288:18:17:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We were careful to drop any reported holdings after any bankruptcy declaration:  there are
48:1445:92378:17:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many cases of institutional investors continuing to report holdings of non-existent securities.

49:1448:92637:34:18:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We also gather CUSIPs for entities that emerge from bankruptcy, or from mergers.  The final
49:1449:92728:18:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set of airlines consists of: AirTran, Alaska, American, Continental, Delta, Eastern, Hawaiian,
49:1450:92822:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:JetBlue,  Northwest,  Pan  Am,  Southwest,  Spirit,  Trans  World,  United,  US  Airways,  and
49:1451:92916:18:18:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Virgin America.  Several of these have multiple CUSIPs over this time period.  We do not
49:1452:93004:18:18:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjust for insider holdings in this exercise, although in practice this may be a good thing to
49:1453:93098:18:51:72:258:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do if insider holdings are significant.
49:1454:93137:51:43:72:188:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:B.3    Short Interest
49:1455:93158:43:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A  known  limitation  of  the  13(f)  data  for  calculating  institutional  ownership  is  that  short
49:1456:93261:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest is double-counted.  When an investor takes a short position they borrow shares from
49:1457:93353:18:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:another investor and sell them, with a promise to repay the shares at a later date.  These
49:1458:93443:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shares are then double-counted, reported on form 13(f) by both the initial investor as well
49:1459:93534:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  the  investor  to  whom  they  are  sold.   It  is  for  this  reason  that  one  can  often  observe
49:1460:93639:18:35:72:454:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“institutional ownership,” as reported in online sources, in excess of 100%.
49:1461:93715:35:18:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Data on short interest are obtained from the Compustat short interest supplemental dataset.
49:1462:93806:18:18:72:540:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These data are available at the firm level, not the investor level.  Moreover, evidence suggests
49:1463:93902:18:0:72:540:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that even if we had data at the investor level, it is not clear how we should think about control

50:1467:94191:33:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rights.  While it seems intuitive that only the actual holder of the stock should cast votes in
50:1468:94286:18:18:72:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corporate governance activities, in practice it seems thatboththe initial investor as well as
50:1469:94379:18:35:72:502:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the current holder may end up voting the same shares, see Kahan and Rock (2008).
50:1470:94459:35:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Appendix  Figure  20  characterizes  the  coverage  of  the  short  interest  data  in  our  sample,
50:1471:94559:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which improves dramatically after 2004.  Appendix Figure 21 documents the degree of short
50:1472:94648:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest.  We see that while short interest in excess of 2% is quite common, short interest in
50:1473:94742:18:0:72:210:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:excess of 20% is quite rare.
