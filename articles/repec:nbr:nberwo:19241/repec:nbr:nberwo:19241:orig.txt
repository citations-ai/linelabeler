2:44:2695:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Understanding how returns to higher education vary across degree programs is critical for effective
2:45:2794:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:higher education policy. Yet there is little evidence as to whether all degrees improve labor market
2:46:2894:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:outcomes, and whether they do so for students from different types of backgrounds. We combine administrative
2:47:3002:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and archival data from Chile with score-based admissions rules at more than 1,100 degree programs
2:48:3099:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to study how the long-run earnings effects of college admission depend on selectivity, field of study,
2:49:3201:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and student characteristics. Our data link admissions outcomes for 30 cohorts of college applicants
2:50:3300:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to administrative records of labor market outcomes up to 30 years post-application. We estimate regression
2:51:3406:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:discontinuity specifications for each degree, and describe how threshold-crossing effects vary by degree
2:52:3510:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:type. In addition, we use variation in admissions outcomes driven by threshold-crossing to estimate
2:53:3609:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a simple model that maps our discontinuity estimates into causal effects of admission by degree. Observed
2:54:3714:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:choice and survey data indicate that the assumptions underlying this model are consistent with student
2:55:3816:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:behavior. We find that returns are heterogeneous, with large, positive returns to highly selective degrees
2:56:3922:14:14:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and degrees in health, science, and social science fields. Returns to selectivity do not vary by student
2:57:4026:14:14:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest a role for policies that guide students toward higher-return
2:58:4129:14:42:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:degrees, such as targeted loans and better college preparation for students from low-income backgrounds.

3:79:4639:0:26:72:201:701:399:g_d0_f2:399:g_d0_f2:1   Introduction 
3:80:4656:26:19:72:524:675:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:The college wage premium in the U.S. has risen dramatically since the early 1980s.1 In response, state 
3:81:4759:19:19:71:503:656:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and local governments seeking to broaden access to higher education have expanded student loan 
3:82:4854:19:19:71:510:637:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:programs.2 Many students have taken advantage of these expansions: college-going rates rose 52% 
3:83:4950:19:19:71:540:618:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:between 1990 and 2010, while federal loan debt per borrower increased by 250%.3 However, default rates 
3:84:5053:19:19:72:542:599:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:on federal student loans also rose through the 2000s, and the early 2010s saw large protests over high debt 
3:85:5161:19:19:72:523:580:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and ex post regret of higher education investment. Similar movements have emerged recently in other 
3:86:5261:19:19:72:533:561:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:developed countries, such as England and Chile, presenting a puzzle for policy makers.4 If the returns to 
3:87:5367:19:19:71:403:542:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:college are high, why are students having trouble paying back their loans?  
3:88:5443:19:19:107:509:523:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:One possibility is that labor market returns vary widely depending on where students go to 
3:89:5534:19:19:71:521:504:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:school, what they study, and their academic and social backgrounds. Though current policy proposals 
3:90:5634:19:19:71:542:485:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:consider regulating loan or grant funding for degrees based on perceived payoffs in the labor market, little 
3:91:5743:19:19:71:525:466:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence exists to guide such interventions.5 In this paper, we use score-based cutoffs for admission to 
3:92:5848:19:19:71:506:447:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:more than 1,100 different college degree programs to obtain causal estimates of the earnings gains 
3:93:5947:19:19:71:530:428:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:associated with admission to each degree. We evaluate earnings outcomes using tax records up to thirty 
3:94:6050:19:19:71:536:409:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:years post-application, and use our estimates to describe how earnings gains vary by program selectivity, 
3:95:6156:19:19:71:528:390:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:field of study, and student socioeconomic background. In doing so, we provide new evidence to inform 
3:96:6257:19:19:71:238:371:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:key higher-education policy debates.  
3:97:6295:19:19:107:538:352:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We accomplish this by exploiting unique and extensive data from Chile, a middle-income OECD 
3:98:6387:19:19:71:535:333:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:member country. Like the U.S., Chile has experienced large gains in enrollment (94%) and loan debt per 
3:99:6490:19:19:71:531:314:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:student (over 100%) in the past 20 years.6 Unlike the U.S., but like many countries in Europe, Asia, and 
3:100:6595:19:19:72:540:295:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Latin America, university admissions outcomes in Chile are determined only by indices of grades and test 
3:101:6700:19:19:72:523:276:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:scores. The admissions system generates sharp cutoffs in admissions outcomes at nearly all university 
3:102:6802:19:27:72:531:257:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree programs, which allows for causal identification of admissions effects at many different margins

4:120:8544:19:19:72:526:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Chilean college applicants to earnings outcomes. Our data link college application records for students 
4:121:8648:19:19:72:529:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:applying to college between 1982 and 2011 to administrative tax return data for the years 2005 through 
4:122:8751:19:19:72:532:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:2012. We collected these data from a combination of administrative and archival sources, linking across 
4:123:8855:19:19:72:318:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:datasets using unique national identification numbers.7  
4:124:8912:19:19:108:541:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Our research design takes advantage of several features of the Chilean college application system. 
4:125:9011:19:19:72:524:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Chilean students apply to a career (major) and university simultaneously (e.g. Civil Engineering at the 
4:126:9115:19:19:72:527:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:University of Chile) as part of a centralized, score-based application process. We refer to an institution-
4:127:9222:19:18:72:514:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:career combination as a degree. Students rank up to eight degree choices in order of preference. The 
4:128:9323:18:19:72:507:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:applicants are then scored by universities using a combination of entrance exam scores and GPAs. 
4:129:9420:19:19:72:530:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Students are admitted to at most one of their choices based on their preferences and their score using an 
4:130:9526:19:19:72:508:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:algorithm similar to that used in the U.S. medical residency match. This process creates regression 
4:131:9626:19:19:72:530:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:discontinuities around a cutoff score that is unknown ex ante (Azevedo and Leshno 2014). We compare 
4:132:9726:19:19:72:394:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:average earnings for students just above versus just below these cutoffs.  
4:133:9801:19:19:108:531:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Our analysis has two components. In the first, we estimate the effects of crossing the thresholds 
4:134:9899:19:19:72:523:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for admission to each of 1,103 degree programs on long-run earnings outcomes. We then compare the 
4:135:9997:19:19:72:533:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:distributions of these effects by the selectivity and field of study of the target degree program, as well as 
4:136:10107:19:19:72:532:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:by student demographics. In the second, we develop a simple model of college choice and earnings, and 
4:137:10209:19:19:72:533:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimate the earnings equation using variation in admissions outcomes generated by threshold-crossing.  
4:138:10313:19:19:108:537:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:These two components complement one another. The first allows us to construct estimates of the 
4:139:10408:19:19:72:529:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings gains associated with admission to different kinds of degree programs for marginal applicants. 
4:140:10512:19:19:72:532:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:These estimates are of interest for a variety of policy questions, such as the choice to marginally expand 
4:141:10619:19:19:72:540:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:or contract a particular degree program. The second allows us to estimate earnings effects for each degree 
4:142:10726:19:19:72:537:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:program relative to a common outside option under the assumption that selection into degree programs is 
4:143:10830:19:19:72:537:254:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:uncorrelated with unobservable determinants of degree-specific comparative advantage. This assumption 
4:144:10932:19:19:72:534:235:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:appears consistent with empirical evidence from observed choices and survey data on the factors driving 
4:145:11036:19:19:72:536:216:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:student choices. Within this framework, we can examine issues such as how quickly earnings effects rise 
4:146:11140:19:19:72:528:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:with degree selectivity, how much earnings returns vary across fields of study, and how socioeconomic 
4:147:11242:19:19:72:406:178:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:status interacts with degree returns in high- versus low-selectivity degrees.  
4:148:11321:19:19:108:526:159:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Our threshold-crossing estimates show that admissions to selective degrees and degrees with a 
4:149:11415:19:24:72:524:140:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:focus on health, social science, or science/technology yield positive and significant earnings gains. On

4:151:11580:7:15:72:533:109:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:7 We were able to compile these data and link them to tax records with the permission and political and logistical support of the 
4:152:11710:15:10:72:526:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:Ministry of Education in Chile (MINEDUC) and the Office of the President. The data collection was permitted and supported 
4:153:11832:10:10:72:520:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:with the purpose of providing research evidence to inform important reforms to higher education policy in response to wide-
4:154:11955:10:0:72:237:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:spread protests over student loan repayment.  
5:155:12004:0:19:72:534:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:average, crossing the threshold for admission to a targeted degree program raises earnings by an amount 
5:156:12108:19:19:72:541:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:equal to 4.5% of the average sample earnings. Threshold-crossing estimates increase in degree selectivity, 
5:157:12215:19:19:72:532:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:from 2.0% for degrees with cutoffs in the lowest selectivity quartile to 9.1% in degrees from the highest 
5:158:12321:19:19:72:527:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:quartile. Effects differ substantially by field of study, with large effects for degrees in health (10.8% of 
5:159:12430:19:19:72:540:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:average earnings) and social science (8.2%). Threshold-crossing effects for art, humanities, and education 
5:160:12537:19:19:72:388:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees are small or negative and do not differ significantly from zero.  
5:161:12611:19:19:107:511:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Threshold crossing estimates reflect the difference between earnings outcomes at the target 
5:162:12703:19:19:71:540:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree and the mix of alternate degrees selected by just-rejected students.  Because marginal applicants to 
5:163:12811:19:18:71:538:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:high-earning target degrees often have high-earning alternate degrees, degree effects evaluated relative to 
5:164:12919:18:19:71:513:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the common outside option are larger and rise more quickly with selectivity than threshold-crossing 
5:165:13019:19:19:71:528:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates, from 4.7% of average earnings in the bottom selectivity quartile to 24.2% in the top quartile. 
5:166:13125:19:19:71:537:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Earnings relative to the outside option are highest for health degrees, social science degrees, law degrees, 
5:167:13234:19:19:71:523:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and science/technology degrees (25.6%, 16.1%, 15.1%, and 11.9% of average earnings, respectively). 
5:168:13333:19:19:71:361:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:These gains do not appear to be fully captured by higher tuition.   
5:169:13401:19:19:107:515:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Looking at heterogeneity in earnings effects by demographic groups, we find similar effects 
5:170:13493:19:19:71:525:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:across selectivity groups for students from low- and high-SES backgrounds. However, effects differ in 
5:171:13595:19:19:71:505:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:intuitive ways by field of study. Students from high-SES backgrounds realize large earnings gains 
5:172:13693:19:19:71:529:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:(30.7%) from attending high-selectivity business degrees, where soft skills, social or familial networks, 
5:173:13799:19:19:71:525:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and networking skills may be more valuable, while students from low-SES backgrounds do not realize 
5:174:13898:19:19:71:504:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:any gains at all. In contrast, students from high- and low-SES backgrounds benefit similarly from 
5:175:13996:19:19:71:458:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:admission to selective health, science and technology, law, and social-science degrees.  
5:176:14085:19:19:107:515:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:This paper contributes to several literatures. This is the first analysis to use many regression 
5:177:14182:19:19:72:510:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:discontinuities to trace out the labor market returns to the marginal admission across the selectivity 
5:178:14285:19:19:72:517:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:distribution. A number of previous authors use regression discontinuity designs to measure the labor 
5:179:14386:19:19:72:513:254:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:market gains associated with admission to particular colleges or secondary schools (Hoekstra 2009;

5:181:14543:19:19:108:528:216:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:This is also the first paper to consider the way that marginal returns vary by field of study, and, 
5:182:14643:19:19:72:514:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:within field of study, by selectivity. In contrast to papers that focus on effects at a single admissions 
5:183:14749:19:19:72:512:178:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:margin, our findings can be used by policymakers considering tradeoffs in the allocation of spots to 
5:184:14850:19:19:72:502:159:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:different degree programs. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quasi-experimental 
5:185:14947:19:19:72:514:140:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence that field of study plays a causal role in determining labor market outcomes; earnings gaps 
5:186:15048:19:19:72:504:121:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:across fields are not just the result of selection.  Our results add to the prior literature which either 
5:187:15154:19:0:72:534:102:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:describes earnings gaps by field of study or corrects for selection into degree programs by modeling and 
6:188:15262:0:19:72:542:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimating the student choice problem (Altonji et al. 2012; Arcidiacono 2004; Beffy, Fougere, and Maurel 
6:189:15367:19:19:72:103:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:2012). 
6:190:15374:19:19:108:516:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Our results suggest that marginal expansions of high-selectivity programs are more likely to 
6:191:15467:19:19:72:538:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:allow students to make investments with high private returns than marginal expansions of low-selectivity 
6:192:15572:19:19:72:541:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:programs. Furthermore, earnings gains from admission to high-selectivity degrees are large for both high- 
6:193:15678:19:19:72:541:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and low-SES students. This suggests that educational policies aimed at increasing the number of low-SES 
6:194:15782:19:19:72:519:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:students qualifying for8 and choosing degrees at selective higher-education institutions could provide 
6:195:15885:19:18:72:536:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:greater economic opportunity than programs that increase the number of low-SES students attending less 
6:196:15988:18:19:72:476:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selective degrees (Hoxby and Avery 2012; Hoxby and Turner 2013; Deming et al. 2014).    
6:197:16076:19:19:108:536:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:The strategy we develop for estimating the effects of interest and assessing the plausibility of the 
6:198:16177:19:19:72:498:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:underlying assumptions may be useful in future work as data encompassing multiple admissions

6:200:16363:19:19:72:537:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:2013). Our model helps identify the labor market effects of different educational programs relative to the 
6:201:16470:19:19:72:525:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:common outside option of not attending a selective degree program using only variation in admissions 
6:202:16571:19:19:72:534:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:outcomes generated by threshold-crossing. In doing so, we link the literature on regression discontinuity 
6:203:16677:19:19:72:483:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates of earnings effects to a broader strand of research that uses other methods to assess 
6:204:16773:19:19:72:541:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity in earnings returns across selectivity (Dale and Krueger 2002, 2011; Black and Smith 2004,

6:206:16977:19:19:108:540:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Finally, our findings speak to key policy questions. First, they suggest sizeable market frictions in 
6:207:17079:19:19:72:533:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the supply of and/or demand for high-return degrees. Marginally increasing offerings in particular fields 
6:208:17185:19:19:72:536:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:could raise aggregate earnings, suggesting constraints on supply (Bound and Turner, 2007). On the other 
6:209:17289:19:19:72:515:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:hand, while excess demand for degrees with zero to negative earnings returns may be driven by non-
6:210:17387:19:19:72:541:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:pecuniary factors, recent empirical evidence suggests that students may make uninformed or short-sighted 
6:211:17492:19:19:72:523:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:college and career choices (Arcidiacono et al. 2010; Jensen, 2010; Scott-Clayton 2012; Hastings et al.

7:223:18411:19:19:72:535:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:1981. CRUCH institutions are all not-for-profit, but can be public, private, or private-parochial. CRUCH 
7:224:18516:19:19:72:531:594:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:universities span a wide range of selectivity levels. The two most selective Universities are Universidad 
7:225:18622:19:19:72:541:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:de Chile (a public university) and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (a private Catholic university), 
7:226:18731:19:19:72:517:556:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:both of which send top students to some of the most selective graduate programs in the world.  Most 
7:227:18831:19:19:72:533:537:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees at these institutions are licenciatura (licensure) degrees, which take 5 years to complete on time. 
7:228:18939:19:19:72:531:518:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Overall, for those entering a CRUCH degree between 2000 and 2004, 63.2% graduated at their enrolled 
7:229:19039:19:19:72:518:499:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:institution within 150% of expected degree completion time.9 The corresponding statistic for all four-

7:231:19203:19:19:107:528:461:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Students applying to CRUCH institutions must take a standardized test for admission. This test 
7:232:19298:19:19:71:538:442:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:was called the PAA (Prueba de Aptitud Académica, or Academic Aptitude Test) until 2002 (taken for the 
7:233:19400:19:19:71:521:423:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:2003 college entering year), and the PSU (Prueba de Selección Universitaria, or University Selection 
7:234:19501:19:19:72:499:404:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f4:Test) after 2002. It is constructed and administered by the central testing authority, DEMRE (for 
7:235:19598:19:19:72:510:385:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f2:Departamento de Evaluación, Medición y Registro Educacional, or the Department of Educational 
7:236:19692:19:19:72:512:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Evaluation, Measurement and Registration), which operates under the authority of the CRUCH. All 
7:237:19788:19:19:72:540:347:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:entrance exam takers complete exams in mathematics and language, and many students also take optional 
7:238:19890:19:19:72:540:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:tests in other subjects. Scores are scaled to a distribution with range 150 to 850 and a mean and median of 
7:239:19998:19:19:72:528:309:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:500. Entrance exam scores, along with high-school GPA, are the primary components of the composite 
7:240:20097:19:19:72:446:290:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:scores used for postsecondary admissions, scholarships, and student loan eligibility.  
7:241:20184:19:19:108:523:271:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:After taking the entrance exam and receiving their scores, students choose where to apply and 
7:242:20278:19:19:72:542:252:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:submit their application to CRUCH.  As in many other postsecondary education systems (though typically 
7:243:20381:19:19:72:519:233:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:not the U.S.), a choice indicates both an institution and a career. We will refer to an institution-career 
7:244:20488:19:19:72:519:214:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:combination as a degree or degree program.  Students submit one application with up to eight ranked 
7:245:20588:19:19:72:504:195:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree choices.11 Once students apply, their entrance exam scores and GPAs are used by CRUCH 
7:246:20681:19:39:71:519:176:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:members to assign a score for each student for each degree. Students selecting a particular degree are

8:255:21497:19:19:72:337:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:applications are submitted to degrees with excess demand.   
8:256:21557:19:19:108:534:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Students are offered at most one admission slot: they are admitted to their most preferred degree 
8:257:21655:19:19:72:519:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for which they achieved a sufficiently high score. Online Appendix, Section II describes the CRUCH 
8:258:21754:19:19:72:501:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:scoring and admission algorithm in detail.  Students have an incentive to rank order their choices 
8:259:21853:19:19:72:519:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:correctly (they should not list a less-preferred choice over a more-preferred choice), though they may 
8:260:21956:19:19:72:536:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:incorporate overall probability of admission in deciding which options to list (as they are capped at eight 
8:261:22064:19:19:72:514:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:options). While students apply with some knowledge of where they might be admitted (applications 
8:262:22161:19:18:72:522:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:display “reach” and “safety” schools), cutoff scores vary unpredictably from year to year as shocks to

8:267:22459:22:18:71:502:457:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:In the 1980s, at the beginning of our sample period, CRUCH universities accounted for nearly all 
8:268:22556:18:19:71:510:439:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:university enrollment in Chile. Students who were not admitted through the centralized application 
8:269:22655:19:19:71:536:420:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:system were forced to enroll in non-selective technical or professional schools if they wished to continue 
8:270:22762:19:19:71:535:401:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:their education. Over time, a number of newer universities operating outside the CRUCH system entered 
8:271:22864:19:19:71:514:382:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the higher education market. These newer universities are predominantly private and typically serve 
8:272:22964:19:19:71:532:363:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:lower-scoring students. They do not participate in the centralized admissions process. During the 1980s, 
8:273:23069:19:19:71:530:344:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:CRUCH universities accounted for more than 95% of university graduates. By 2000, however, near the 
8:274:23168:19:19:71:525:325:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:end of our sample period, the CRUCH share had fallen to 67%.13 Online Appendix Section I discusses 
8:275:23266:19:19:72:522:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:how outside postsecondary options in Chile have changed between 1983 and 2009.14 Solis (2013) and

8:278:23520:19:19:108:521:249:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:One goal of this paper is to measure the earnings gains associated with admission to selective 
8:279:23615:19:19:71:520:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:CRUCH degree programs relative to the common outside option of not attending a selective CRUCH 
8:280:23710:19:19:71:537:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:program. To better understand how changes in this outside option over time may affect our estimates, we 
8:281:23814:19:19:71:519:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:will present threshold-crossing and model estimates based on only the 1982-1989 application cohorts 
8:282:23914:19:19:71:515:173:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:alongside our main estimates for the full set of 1982-2006 applicants. For these students, the outside 
8:283:24017:19:19:71:533:154:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:option for higher education was a technical or professional degree rather than a non-CRUCH university. 
8:284:24120:19:19:71:514:135:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Estimates for older cohorts have a clearer outside option to aid interpretation, but span fewer degree

8:286:24283:7:15:72:520:109:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:12 Admission cutoff scores vary significantly within a degree over time. The average standard deviation in cutoff score for a 
8:287:24409:15:10:71:78:94:81:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:degree in our marginal sample is 19.4 points, making the actual cutoff in a particular year unpredictable. 13

9:296:25219:19:19:71:524:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:these numbers were 34.8%, 12.6%, and 52.5% respectively (see enrollment tables in Online Appendix

9:301:25718:19:19:71:502:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:can be thought of as consisting of a) eventual (within 2 years) CRUCH enrollment (about 26% of

10:327:27992:19:19:72:532:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:classify students as low-SES if they graduated from a high school that received an A, B, or C ranking in 
10:328:28097:19:19:72:542:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:2000.18 Though some high schools from the 1980s and 1990s do not appear in 2000 data, most do. We are 
10:329:28199:19:19:71:468:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:able to match 84% of marginal applicants overall, including 79% of pre-1990 applicants.  
10:330:28288:19:19:107:515:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Beginning in 2001, we have electronic records of the full college application process. These 
10:331:28381:19:19:71:538:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:records include high school graduation records with gender, GPA and high school of graduation. We link 
10:332:28484:19:19:71:507:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:these records to digital records of applications to CRUCH schools. These records include all listed 
10:333:28584:19:19:71:513:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:choices, admissions and waitlist decisions, and demographic information such as gender and family 
10:334:28682:19:18:71:530:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:income. Additionally, we link these records to entrance exam scores.  For the years 2000 through 2011, 
10:335:28785:18:19:71:506:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:we have data on college attendance and graduation from almost all postsecondary degree-granting 
10:336:28881:19:19:71:522:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:institutions in Chile. We worked with Mineduc to compile these data.  Combined, these data give us a 
10:337:28982:19:19:71:479:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:panel of college applicants and graduates from 1982 through 2011 – 30 cohorts of students.  
10:338:29074:19:19:107:521:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We match these data to individual tax records at the Chilean tax authority in compliance with 
10:339:29168:19:19:71:518:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Chilean privacy laws.19 Over 99% of individuals in our data have matches in the tax records. The tax 
10:340:29269:19:19:71:485:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:records are available for tax years 2005 to 2012, and include all labor earnings. Prior to 2005, 
10:341:29366:19:19:71:517:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:administrative earnings micro-data are not available for a significant portion of wage earners. Online 
10:342:29469:19:19:71:519:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Appendix Section IV describes the tax records in Chile in detail and explains how we construct labor 
10:343:29570:19:19:71:289:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings. All values are reported in 2011 pesos.   
10:344:29621:19:19:108:535:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Our earnings analysis includes zero earnings values. We include zero earnings to capture returns 
10:345:29718:19:19:71:527:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:due to changes in the extensive labor supply margin as well as increases in productivity and movement 
10:346:29820:19:19:71:494:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:along the intensive labor supply margin. In Online Appendix Section VII we present regression 
10:347:29914:19:19:71:541:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:discontinuity estimates of participation effects. These effects are quite small: our results are driven largely 
10:348:30026:19:19:71:513:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:by changes in earnings conditional on some work. We top-code the highest one percent of earnings, 
10:349:30124:19:19:71:490:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:conditional on cohort and experience, to reduce the impact of earnings outliers in our analysis. 
10:350:30221:19:19:71:524:254:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Specifically, we divide earnings observations into cells based on a full interaction between application 
10:351:30326:19:19:71:531:235:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:cohort and years since application. We then set observations in the top one percent of the distribution in 
10:352:30433:19:19:71:531:216:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:each bin to the 99th percentile value for the bin. Our results are robust to moving this threshold up to the 
10:353:30542:19:19:71:525:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:99.5th percentile or down to the 98th percentile. We present regression discontinuity estimates for these 
10:354:30648:19:31:71:333:178:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:alternate top-code values in Online Appendix Section VII.

10:356:30767:7:15:72:541:140:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:18 The poverty ratings are highly correlated with family income. We measured family income in tax data using parental identifiers 
10:357:30896:15:10:71:522:125:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:linked to student identifiers. Our family income measures are highly correlated with the Mineduc poverty rating. In addition, 
10:358:31022:10:10:71:78:115:81:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:there are no municipal (public, non-voucher) schools with poverty-rating E, and no private schools with poverty-rating A.  19

11:367:32002:19:19:72:533:628:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:science, business administration, education, health, humanities, law, social science, and technology. The 
11:368:32108:19:19:72:525:609:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:basic science and agriculture classifications contain relatively few degree programs, so we group them 
11:369:32211:19:19:72:526:590:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:with technology degrees into a broader science/technology category based on similar program content. 
11:370:32312:19:19:72:527:571:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:This leaves us with eight fields of study. Online Appendix Section V details these field categorizations 
11:371:32417:19:19:72:520:552:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and provides examples of specific careers in different field and selectivity categories.20 The second is 
11:372:32522:19:19:72:531:533:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity. We categorize degrees into selectivity tiers based on quartiles of average math and language 
11:373:32628:19:19:72:523:514:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:scores for admitted students. Two degrees within the same institution can fall into different selectivity 
11:374:32734:19:19:72:421:495:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:categories; some institutions may specialize in certain fields and not in others.  
11:375:32817:19:19:108:499:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Tables A.I.I. and A.I.II in the Online Appendix present descriptive statistics on CRUCH 
11:376:32905:19:18:72:535:457:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:institutions and CRUCH applications, respectively. While selectivity is defined at the degree level, some 
11:377:33011:18:20:72:526:439:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:institutions have more selective degrees across all fields than others. Pontificia Universidad Católica is 
11:378:33118:20:18:72:520:419:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the most selective private institution and Universidad de Chile is the most selective public institution. 
11:379:33224:18:19:72:519:401:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:However, both offer a wide range of degrees, not all of which are of above-median selectivity. Many 
11:380:33324:19:19:72:523:382:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:universities offer some selective options, with the fraction of selective degrees increasing with overall 
11:381:33430:19:19:72:541:363:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:university selectivity. Some universities focus on particular fields (e.g. education at U. Metro. en Ciencias 
11:382:33540:19:19:72:527:344:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:de la Educación or U. de la Serena). Students applying to CRUCH over the years 2001-2011 (the years 
11:383:33640:19:19:72:532:325:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for which data on preference rankings is available) on average list only four or five out of eight possible 
11:384:33748:19:19:72:498:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:choices. Students list an average of three to four different careers in close to two different CINE-
11:385:33848:19:19:72:537:287:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:UNESCO areas, at 2.5 different universities and crossing 1.6 to 1.7 selectivity tiers. On average, students 
11:386:33956:19:19:72:538:268:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:who are admitted somewhere are selected to a little less than their second choice.  About 68% of students 
11:387:34062:19:19:72:441:249:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:are admitted to at least one choice, and of those, 70-75% matriculate at that choice. 
11:388:34148:19:19:108:542:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Combining each of the data sets above, we construct an estimation sample of applications that fall 
11:389:34247:19:19:72:507:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:within 25 points on either side of the admission cutoff to a degree-year for which there was excess 
11:390:34347:19:19:72:532:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:demand. We define degree-year combinations as having excess demand if we observe a minimum of 18 
11:391:34444:19:19:72:544:173:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:applications in the five points below the cutoff score.21 These are the students on the margin of admission.

12:399:35204:19:19:72:515:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimation sample. Column 3 shows summary statistics for applications in the estimation sample for 
12:400:35303:19:19:72:542:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:which we have full data on field of study and selectivity for the target degree. We are missing this data for 
12:401:35413:19:19:72:529:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:approximately three percent of applications.22 On average, students in our marginal sample have higher 
12:402:35516:19:19:71:531:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:entrance exam scores, are more likely to be applying to a business degree, and less likely to be applying 
12:403:35622:19:19:71:502:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:to an education degree. They are more likely to be applying to high-selectivity degrees, since low 
12:404:35721:19:19:71:367:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity degrees may not have marginal students in some years.  
12:405:35788:19:19:107:522:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Marginal applicants are slightly more likely to be male, and significantly more likely to come 
12:406:35883:19:18:71:539:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:from high SES high schools. Average labor earnings between 2005 and 2012 (in constant 2011 pesos) for 
12:407:35985:18:19:71:539:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:our marginal group are about 18% higher than those for the total applicant population. Converting to U.S. 
12:408:36091:19:19:71:530:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:dollars using OECD Purchasing Power Parity data for 2011 indicates that mean earnings for students in 
12:409:36193:19:19:71:502:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the applicant population were roughly $25,400, compared to $29,000 for students in the marginal 
12:410:36289:19:19:71:522:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:sample.23 To facilitate interpretation, we will divide estimated effects by mean full sample earnings in 
12:411:36394:19:19:72:533:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:much of what follows. We observe positive earnings for 82.3% of students in the full sample and 83.2% 
12:412:36496:19:19:72:231:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:of students in the marginal sample.  
12:413:36533:19:19:108:528:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We observe students applying to between 450 and 900 different CRUCH degrees per year over 
12:414:36623:19:19:72:503:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the period 1982-2006. Overall, we observe 1,923 separate CRUCH degree programs, with degree 
12:415:36715:19:19:72:529:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:identifiers missing for 1.3% of applications. We observe marginal students subject to binding cutoffs in 
12:416:36820:19:19:72:516:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:1,103 of these degree programs, accounting for 88.2% of all applications. The remaining degrees for 
12:417:36920:19:19:72:536:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:which there are no regression discontinuities are defined as part of the outside option, which we interpret 
12:418:37028:19:19:72:511:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:as including the option to attend a non-selective CRUCH degree program. We also examine a more 
12:419:37123:19:19:72:510:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:inclusive definition of binding admissions cutoffs as a robustness check. This alternative definition 
12:420:37225:19:19:72:532:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:includes 1,188 degrees and 91.3% of all applications. Our findings are robust to this change. See Online

14:492:41813:21:23:72:534:217:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:To do so requires further assumptions on either the ipor the process by which students choose degrees.  
14:493:41918:23:19:72:528:194:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:One approach is to jointly model and estimate choice of degree and earnings outcomes, assuming fully-
14:494:42019:19:19:72:536:175:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:informed and forward-looking degree choice driven by correct beliefs about earnings distributions over a

14:498:42405:18:10:72:78:115:81:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:possible differences in the growth of earnings for students admitted to different degree programs.  26
14:499:42507:10:11:78:521:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2: To solve this same problem in the school choice setting, researchers often  impose that impact of school admission on test 
14:500:42631:11:10:72:537:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:scores is a function of measureable school value-added, and use a probability-weighted value-added of home schools to measure 
14:501:42757:10:10:72:539:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:gains in school quality from crossing a threshold or winning a lottery. See for example Deming et al (2014). Here we do not have 
14:502:42886:10:0:71:434:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:a-priori measures of earnings gains by field and degree of study, rather the goal is to estimate them.  
15:503:42994:0:19:72:504:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:functional form assumptions on utility from degree choice. We would jointly estimate returns and 
15:504:43091:19:19:72:533:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:preference parameters in the utility model we specify. Alternatively, we can restrict φ to be a function of 
15:505:43198:19:19:72:532:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:interactions between degree and student characteristics. This approach is consistent with general models 
15:506:43303:19:19:72:523:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:of choice and, unlike the first approach, appears to be supported by current survey evidence as well as 
15:507:43407:19:20:72:399:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence from choice and earnings data. We follow this second approach. 
15:508:43479:20:25:107:538:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Specifically, we allow earnings for individual i to be a function of the degree-level effect,p, and

16:540:45456:19:19:72:533:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:high schools by student income) or low (for students in the bottom 60%). This specification allows for a 
16:541:45561:19:19:72:532:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:different impact of admission on high- versus low-SES students by degree category. We divide students 
16:542:45663:19:19:72:538:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:into three groups based on measured skill: a “comparative advantage math” group whose math test scores 
16:543:45766:19:19:72:518:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:exceed their reading test score by at least 50 points, a “comparative advantage reading” group whose 
16:544:45867:19:19:72:525:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:reading scores exceed their math scores by at least 50 points, and a “no comparative advantage” group 
16:545:45969:19:19:72:522:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:whose math and reading scores fall within 50 points of one another. One might expect students with a 
16:546:46070:19:18:72:507:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:comparative advantage in math to perform relatively better at math-intensive degrees in science or 
16:547:46169:18:19:72:129:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:technology.  
16:548:46182:19:19:108:542:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Note that these restrictions apply to the factors that drive degree choice, not to all heterogeneity in 
16:549:46286:19:21:72:506:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree-specific earnings effects. For example, if students have uniform evaluations of degrees and 
16:550:46385:21:23:72:523:499:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:expected earnings, perhaps as a function of degree selectivity or prestige,28 then the ip may not drive 
16:551:46490:23:19:72:539:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:choice even if they affect earnings outcomes. If expected deviations from degree-specific earnings effects 
16:552:46597:19:24:72:537:457:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:are less important to students than fit (i.e., “doing what you love”) when selecting field of study, then the 
16:553:46707:24:21:78:520:433:44:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f2:ipmay not drive choice. Generally speaking, we will obtain consistent estimates of treatment effects 
16:554:46809:21:18:72:542:412:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:when students are either a) unaware of their idiosyncratic degree-specific earnings effects or b) place little 
16:555:46920:18:19:72:532:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:weight on earnings in degree selection, and c) preferences over other degree attributes are not correlated 
16:556:47027:19:19:72:292:375:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:with individual-specific comparative advantage.   
16:557:47077:19:22:108:527:356:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:To see this, consider a choice of degree where person i’s beliefs about expected earnings at the

16:568:48184:15:10:71:518:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:variables, where C is the number of categories into which we divide students and G is the number categories into which we

16:570:48332:10:0:78:499:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2: See for example Winston 1999, Epple et al. 2013, Hastings et al. 2014, Hastings, Neilson and Zimmerman 2014a,b. 
17:571:48449:0:24:72:542:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates of p.29 Alternatively, if ipV is correlated with ip only through characteristics observable to the 
17:572:48560:24:19:72:537:685:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:econometrician, then the heterogeneous effects model based on observables will capture heterogeneity in 
17:573:48664:19:19:71:409:666:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings gains without imposing strict distributional assumptions on beliefs. 
17:574:48742:19:19:107:532:647:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Several types of evidence indicate that these assumptions are more consistent with the data than 
17:575:48839:19:19:71:529:628:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the alternative of a fully-informed, forward-looking, and rational model of degree choice. First, we find 
17:576:48945:19:19:71:526:609:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:no evidence of selection into degree programs on the basis of observable comparative advantage. Male 
17:577:49046:19:19:71:528:590:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:students, students from high-SES backgrounds, and strong math students are no more likely to apply to 
17:578:49148:19:19:71:541:571:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree programs where students like them earn more. In contrast, high-SES students and male students do 
17:579:49252:19:19:71:507:552:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:appear to select into degrees where all students earn more. We discuss these results in Section 5.3. 
17:580:49353:19:19:107:541:533:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Second, our findings are consistent with current empirical evidence on the determinants of degree 
17:581:49451:19:19:71:505:514:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:choice. This literature suggests that students choose degrees with access to limited information on 
17:582:49551:19:19:71:524:495:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings outcomes and with a heavy emphasis on non-pecuniary characteristics. Hastings et al. (2014) 
17:583:49652:19:19:71:535:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:analyze survey data from tens of thousands of Chilean college applicants and college students. They find 
17:584:49757:19:19:71:533:457:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:that the majority of respondents list prestige and accreditation as the primary reason for degree selection 
17:585:49865:19:19:71:539:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:while only 11% list future earnings as one of their top three determinants of degree choice (only 2% list it 
17:586:49974:19:19:71:516:419:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:as their top reason). Given a hypothetical question about willingness to switch careers in response to 
17:587:50077:19:19:71:507:400:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:economy-wide changes in relative earnings, over 43% say they would never change their career in 
17:588:50173:19:19:71:536:381:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:response to relative earnings changes.30 Between 35% and 47% of applicants do not know what they will 
17:589:50275:19:19:71:312:362:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:expect to earn as graduates from their chosen degrees. 
17:590:50330:19:19:108:510:343:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Other authors find similar results in different contexts. Though few estimates of institution-
17:591:50424:19:18:71:532:324:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:specific earnings expectations are available, evidence from papers such as Pallais (2009) and Avery and 
17:592:50528:18:19:71:513:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Hoxby (2004) suggests that institution choice depends heavily on the framing of choice options and 
17:593:50627:19:19:71:539:287:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:financial aid outcomes.31 Wiswall and Zafar (2013) present evidence that even enrolled undergraduates at 
17:594:50732:19:19:72:529:268:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:highly selective US institutions—a group well situated to make informed choices-- are poorly informed 
17:595:50834:19:19:72:536:249:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:about the distribution of earnings outcomes across field of study, and that tastes, rather than earnings, are 
17:596:50944:19:19:72:510:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the primary determinant of major choice. More broadly, Hastings, Neilson and Zimmerman (2014) 
17:597:51038:19:28:72:516:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:analyze student choice and market response to the expansion of student loans in Chile and show that

17:599:51198:7:16:72:504:176:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:29 Intuitively, in a dichotomous choice between two degrees, the expected earnings for those admitted to p instead of an

17:602:51451:10:11:78:538:136:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2: The question specifically asked “Suppose that INE [the National Labor Institute] just released a new report that proves that the 
17:603:51581:11:10:72:534:125:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:salaries for graduates in [first choice field] have fallen by 10%. Now, instead of earning [respondent estimate of earnings in that 
17:604:51713:10:10:72:510:115:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:field], you will earn [X% less than expected value]. Would you feel the need to change this career option for another?” X 
17:605:51835:10:11:72:528:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:increased if the respondent answered “no”, from 10% to 50%, at which point respondents could click “never” or fill in a value 
17:606:51961:11:10:72:78:94:81:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:higher than 50% for the wage change it would take to induce them to switch careers. 31
17:607:52047:10:10:78:528:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2: See Scott-Clayton (2012) for a review, and Hastings, Madrian, & Skimmyhorn (2013) for a discussion of market conditions 
17:608:52168:10:0:72:289:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:that may reduce incentives for firms to educate consumers.  
18:609:52232:0:19:72:499:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:enrollment and tuition responses from schools are consistent with a market where students value 
18:610:52328:19:19:72:524:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity as a measure of degree quality (which is a homogeneous degree attribute) and tuition net of 
18:611:52432:19:19:72:253:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:loan caps (out-of-pocket up-front cost).   
18:612:52475:19:19:108:515:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Finally, we will show that allowing for comparative advantage in terms of gender, SES, and 
18:613:52566:19:19:72:521:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:relative skill produces estimates very similar to those obtained under the assumption of homogeneous 
18:614:52667:19:19:72:502:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree effects.  In sum, the four models we estimate capture key features of choices and earnings 
18:615:52765:19:19:72:520:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:outcomes, and allow us to estimate returns by degree from regression discontinuity estimates without

18:617:52966:18:19:72:534:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings. We can use these estimates to shed light on key policy questions around how returns vary with

18:621:53150:21:19:72:539:471:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We estimate (1) and (4) using data on mean 2005-2012 earnings. We exclude applicant-year observations 
18:622:53252:19:19:71:484:452:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for which fewer than six years have elapsed since the year of college application. We include 
18:623:53346:19:19:71:542:433:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:observations with zero earnings values in our regressions. We focus our analysis on a 25-point window on 
18:624:53451:19:19:71:534:414:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:either side of admissions cutoff values, and include second-order polynomials in score. The polynomials 
18:625:53555:19:19:71:539:395:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:are allowed to change above and below the cutoff value. Because individuals can appear at more than one 
18:626:53659:19:19:71:520:376:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:threshold (they may just fail to be admitted to p and just cross the threshold to q), we cluster standard 
18:627:53765:19:19:71:505:357:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:errors at the individual level. Cluster – robust standard errors are computed using a wild-bootstrap 
18:628:53866:19:19:71:508:338:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:procedure (Cameron et al. 2008, Davidson and MacKinnon 2010). The wild bootstrap allows us to

18:630:54065:19:19:71:542:300:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:specific threshold-crossing estimates, and ensures that the population of students at each threshold is fixed 
18:631:54175:19:19:71:515:281:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:across bootstrap replications. Online Appendix Section VI provides further details on the estimation

18:634:54375:19:19:71:536:224:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:summarize the distribution of estimates by program selectivity and field of study, weighting by counts of 
18:635:54481:19:19:71:516:205:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:marginal applicants.  We focus on group-specific means, but in addition present results from various 
18:636:54582:19:19:71:521:186:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:quantiles of the earnings distribution. For our comparative advantage models, we present estimates of 
18:637:54684:19:19:71:536:167:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:treatment-on-the-treated effects, weighting by counts of marginal applicants within demographic groups. 
18:638:54788:19:19:71:538:148:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Online Appendix Section VII presents several robustness checks.  We present standard robustness checks

19:641:55094:0:19:72:529:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates that allow for unrestricted variation in degree effects by demographic group. Our findings are

19:646:55269:21:19:72:540:590:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We first consider standard tests of RD validity. If students are unaware of admissions cutoffs when taking 
19:647:55376:19:19:71:534:571:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:exams and making application decisions, they should be unable to target their scores so as to just exceed 
19:648:55482:19:19:71:498:552:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the admissions threshold (McCrary 2008). Figure 1 presents a histogram of scores relative to the 
19:649:55579:19:19:71:542:533:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:threshold value, using data pooled across all applications. There is no evidence of discontinuous clumping 
19:650:55686:19:19:72:516:514:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:in the distribution of scores above the threshold. In addition, if the regression-discontinuity design is 
19:651:55792:19:19:71:518:495:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:valid, observable and unobservable characteristics of students will be balanced across the admissions 
19:652:55894:19:19:72:503:476:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:threshold (Lee 2007). Figure 2 plots an index of baseline characteristics against distance from the 
19:653:55994:19:19:72:521:457:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:admission cutoff. The index is the portion of earnings predicted by baseline characteristics in an OLS 
19:654:56097:19:19:72:537:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:regression of labor market earnings that also controls for polynomials in score and cohort and experience 
19:655:56203:19:19:72:533:419:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects. Baseline characteristics include gender, high school type (dummies for private and voucher high 
19:656:56308:19:19:72:542:400:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:schools), and cohort. There is no visible discontinuity around the threshold. Table 2 presents the impact of 
19:657:56417:19:19:72:528:381:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:threshold crossing on baseline characteristics, pooled as well as by the degree characteristics of interest 
19:658:56525:19:19:72:529:362:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:(field, coursework, selectivity). Magnitudes of estimated discontinuities are uniformly small, and differ 
19:659:56631:19:19:72:540:343:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:statistically from zero at the ten percent level in only one of 15 joint or pooled tests. See Online Appendix

19:662:56918:19:19:72:518:286:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:score for applications from 2000 to 2011.  Recall that we currently only have complete matriculation 
19:663:57019:19:19:72:512:267:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:records for these years. As reported in the final column of Table 2, threshold crossing causes a 49.9 
19:664:57121:19:19:72:523:248:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:percentage point increase in the probability of matriculating in the target degree.  This is less than 100 
19:665:57228:19:19:72:536:229:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:percentage points because admitted students may opt not to enroll to pursue alternative plans or try again 
19:666:57335:19:19:72:527:210:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:next year for a higher ranked choice, and because non-admitted students may be pulled off the waitlist. 
19:667:57439:19:19:72:527:191:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Waitlist effects are visible among score bins just to the left of the cutoff.  Table 2 also breaks down the 
19:668:57547:19:19:72:469:172:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:matriculation effects of admission by field of study and selectivity. Law, Humanities, and 
19:669:57638:19:19:72:537:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Science/Technology degrees have the largest matriculation effects, while Art/Architecture and Education 
19:670:57742:19:19:72:508:134:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees have the smallest.  Matriculation rates are larger for more selective degrees, which may be 
19:671:57842:19:19:72:303:115:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:because they are higher ranked choices on average.  
19:672:57894:19:19:108:519:96:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Threshold-crossing effects capture the earnings impact of being admitted to the target degree 
19:673:57988:19:0:72:521:77:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:program relative to the mix of degrees where students would otherwise have been admitted. This mix 
20:674:58091:0:19:72:535:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:varies across target degrees. Table 3 describes acceptance outcomes for students just below the threshold 
20:675:58197:19:19:72:529:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for admission to different types of target degrees.32 If rejected students are accepted elsewhere, they are 
20:676:58305:19:19:72:531:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:most likely to be accepted to a degree in the same field. For instance, 32.3% of rejected business degree 
20:677:58411:19:19:72:506:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:applicants are accepted to another business degree. Outcomes also vary by selectivity of the target 
20:678:58511:19:19:72:520:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:program. 56.6% of students rejected from programs of above-median selectivity are accepted at other 
20:679:58611:19:19:72:533:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:such programs, while 17.7% are accepted at lower-selectivity programs and 25.6% end up in the outside 
20:680:58713:19:19:72:525:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:option. The equivalent figures for students rejected from below-median selectivity programs are 4.4%, 
20:681:58815:19:19:72:534:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:44.6%, and 51.0%. These patterns suggest that threshold-crossing estimates understate the differences in 
20:682:58920:19:18:72:531:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings effects between students applying to high-return fields or high-selectivity degrees compared to 
20:683:59025:18:19:72:498:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:low-return fields or low-selectivity degrees, since their below-threshold outcomes likely provide 
20:684:59123:19:19:72:532:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:relatively large earnings gains compared to the below-threshold outcomes for applicants to lower-return

20:689:59331:19:19:72:512:413:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:The first two columns of Table 4 display means of the estimated degree-specific threshold-crossing 
20:690:59430:19:19:72:495:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects, pooled over all degrees and disaggregated by selectivity. We present earnings effects as 
20:691:59528:19:19:71:534:375:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:percentages of average earnings in the tax records – 8.83 million pesos.  A coefficient of 0.1 implies that 
20:692:59636:19:19:71:515:356:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:annual earnings gains are equal to 0.1*8.83 million pesos, or about $1,800 USD.33 When computing 
20:693:59733:19:19:72:520:337:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:means across degree programs, we weight by the counts of marginal students at each degree. Overall, 
20:694:59833:19:19:72:509:318:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:crossing the threshold for admission to a target degree program raises earnings by 4.5% of average 
20:695:59932:19:19:72:539:299:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings. If we restrict our analysis to students applying between 1982 and 1989, that value rises to 8.2%. 
20:696:60040:19:19:72:542:280:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Both estimates differ significantly from zero at the 1% level. Mean threshold-crossing effects rise with the 
20:697:60149:19:19:72:536:261:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity of the target degree. In the full sample, they grow from 2.0% in the lowest selectivity quartile, 
20:698:60259:19:19:72:509:242:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:to 3.7% and 3.4% in the middle two quartiles, to 9.1% in the top quartile. Effects in the 1982-1989 
20:699:60359:19:19:72:532:223:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:sample follow a similar pattern, but with effect estimates reaching 23.4% for the most selective degrees. 
20:700:60465:19:19:72:511:204:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Figures 4 and 5 present graphical evidence of earnings discontinuities from pooled specifications.34 
20:701:60565:19:19:108:525:185:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:The remaining columns of Table 4 present instrumental variables estimates of degree program 
20:702:60657:19:19:72:540:166:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects that account for differences in the composition of below-threshold admissions outcomes and allow 
20:703:60762:19:31:72:537:147:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for various forms of heterogeneity in program effects. Column 3 presents estimates under the assumption

20:705:60926:7:11:72:487:109:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:32 These estimates are obtained using local polynomial regressions in the subsample of rejected marginal students.

20:707:61097:10:14:72:539:88:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:34 Estimates from pooled specifications presented in these and the following figures closely resemble but are not always identical 
20:708:61228:14:0:71:387:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:to the estimates aggregated from degree-specific specifications presented in the tables.

21:710:61423:23:20:72:512:684:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:to vary by gender, socioeconomic status, and relative proficiency in math and reading, respectively. 
21:711:61524:20:18:72:527:664:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Because these estimates account for the fact that below-threshold students often attend degrees that are 
21:712:61629:18:19:72:533:646:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:fairly similar to the target degree, they are, on average, larger than threshold-crossing estimates, and rise 
21:713:61739:19:19:72:536:627:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:more with selectivity. In the homogeneous effects model, the mean degree program effect is 12.1%, with 
21:714:61842:19:19:72:539:608:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects of 4.7%, 8.4%, 11.3%, and 24.2% in selectivity quartiles one through four, respectively. Estimates 
21:715:61949:19:19:71:524:589:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:that allow for heterogeneity in degree effects yield estimates very similar to those in the homogeneous 
21:716:62053:19:19:71:533:570:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects model. Column 7 presents estimates for the homogeneous effects model with the sample of 1982-
21:717:62154:19:19:71:536:551:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:1989 applicants. As was the case for threshold-crossing estimates, estimated effects are larger within this 
21:718:62262:19:19:71:529:532:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:sample, particularly for the most selective degrees. The pooled average is 15.6%, with degree effects in 
21:719:62367:19:19:71:218:513:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the top quartile reaching 46.1%.

21:721:62495:19:19:72:535:475:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects and comparative-advantage models. Earnings effects are small at low selectivity levels, and grow 
21:722:62600:19:19:72:535:456:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:slowly until a score of roughly 650 points, when they begin to grow more rapidly.  In Chile, the majority 
21:723:62706:19:19:72:526:437:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:of student loan recipients apply to low-selectivity degrees, and non-selective universities have seen the 
21:724:62812:19:19:72:294:418:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:largest growth in demand during the past decade.  
21:725:62862:19:19:108:518:399:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Figure 6.B. shows the distribution of average entrance exam scores for CAE-loan-takers (the 
21:726:62954:19:19:72:514:380:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:main federal loan program) versus non-takers. The bulk of loan takers have entrance exam scores in 
21:727:63053:19:19:72:540:361:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:lower-selectivity range.  Hastings, Neilson and Zimmerman (2014) show that loan receipt causes students 
21:728:63157:19:19:72:535:342:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:with test scores in the 475-500 range to substitute away from technical degrees into university degrees at 
21:729:63264:19:19:72:510:323:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:low-selectivity institutions, leaving expected earnings unchanged.  Figure 6 and Table 4 add causal 
21:730:63363:19:19:72:532:304:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence consistent with this finding: being admitted to a low-selectivity institution may offer relatively 
21:731:63471:19:19:72:517:285:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:low labor market returns over the outside option (no university, technical or professional degrees per 
21:732:63574:19:19:72:202:266:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Online Appendix Section I).  
21:733:63603:19:19:108:525:247:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Estimated effects are fairly large but not implausible in the context of existing evidence on the 
21:734:63701:19:19:72:527:228:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:returns to selectivity. The average threshold-crossing estimate reflects a gain of 6.8% relative to below-
21:735:63807:19:19:72:511:209:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:threshold earnings (below-threshold-earnings values are on average somewhat smaller than sample-
21:736:63903:19:19:72:500:190:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:average earnings). For comparison, Hoekstra (2009) estimates the earnings gains associated with 
21:737:63999:19:19:72:539:171:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:admission to a state flagship university at between 11% and 17%, while Zimmerman (2014) estimates the 
21:738:64101:19:19:72:532:152:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:gains associated with admission to the Florida state university system to be between 22% and 27%. One 
21:739:64203:19:19:72:539:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:possible explanation for the smaller effects we find is that students’ ability to apply to many fairly similar 
21:740:64314:19:19:72:510:114:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree programs at different institutions means their below-threshold outcomes are more similar to 
21:741:64413:19:19:72:265:95:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:above-threshold outcomes than in the U.S.

22:748:64901:19:19:71:506:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:fields of health (10.8%), social science (8.2%), and science/technology (4.4%). Each effect differs 
22:749:65001:19:19:71:527:594:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:significantly from zero at the 1% level. Threshold-crossing effects do not differ significantly from zero 
22:750:65107:19:19:71:519:575:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for other fields. The estimated effect for law is relatively large (7%) but imprecisely estimated, while 
22:751:65212:19:19:71:523:556:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects for business and education are positive but small (2.7% and 1.5%, respectively) and effects for 
22:752:65316:19:19:71:529:537:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:art/architecture and the humanities are negative (-3% and -2.7%, respectively). Estimates are larger and 
22:753:65421:19:19:71:455:518:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:less precise when the sample is limited to the 1982-1989 cohorts. Admission to health, 
22:754:65508:19:19:71:530:499:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:science/technology, law, and social science degrees has the largest earnings effects, although we cannot 
22:755:65613:19:19:71:539:480:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:reject the null that the mean effect for social science degrees is zero. Figure 7 presents graphical evidence 
22:756:65723:19:19:71:352:461:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:of earnings discontinuities by field from pooled specifications.  
22:757:65789:19:19:108:538:442:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Model estimates that take into account differences in below-threshold outcomes yield wider gaps 
22:758:65885:19:19:71:505:423:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:in earnings outcomes than do threshold-crossing estimates. Results from the homogeneous effects 
22:759:65981:19:19:71:524:404:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:specification show that admission to a health degree raises earnings by 25.6% compared to the outside 
22:760:66083:19:19:71:514:385:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:option, admission to a social science degree by 16.1%, admission to a science/technology degree by 
22:761:66182:19:19:71:538:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:11.9%, and admission to a law degree by 15.1%. Effects for business degrees are fairly large (10.1%) but 
22:762:66287:19:19:71:541:347:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:noisily estimated, while effects for education degrees (4.2%) are smaller but differ significantly from zero 
22:763:66396:19:19:71:538:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:at the ten percent level. Effects for art/architecture and humanities degrees are close zero. We obtain very 
22:764:66505:19:19:71:531:309:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:similar results in models that allow for heterogeneity in degree effects by gender, socioeconomic status, 
22:765:66611:19:19:71:200:290:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and math and reading skills.  
22:766:66641:19:19:108:528:271:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:These results suggest that just failing to be admitted to a program of choice could be one of the 
22:767:66739:19:19:71:527:252:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:luckiest or unluckiest events for a student’s expected future earnings. Based on results from Column 3, 
22:768:66843:19:19:71:504:233:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:students just admitted to a health degree program rather than education degree program realize an 
22:769:66941:19:19:71:496:214:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings gain of 21.4%, while students admitted to a social science degree program relative to a 
22:770:67038:19:19:71:338:195:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:humanities degree program realize earnings gains of 16.2%. 
22:771:67097:19:19:108:535:176:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We next explore the way selectivity effects vary by field. Table 6 combines selectivity measures 
22:772:67194:19:19:71:528:157:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and field of study by reporting earnings impacts by field for degrees above or below median selectivity 
22:773:67298:19:19:71:491:138:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:(more – or less – selective, respectively).   We present the threshold-crossing estimates and the 
22:774:67396:19:19:71:511:119:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:homogeneous effects model estimates only to conserve space. In the health field threshold-crossing 
22:775:67495:19:19:71:535:100:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects are of similar (large, positive) sizes at both high and low selectivity levels, while model estimates 
22:776:67605:19:0:71:525:81:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:of degree effects are substantially larger for high-selectivity degrees. Earnings gains for law and social 
23:777:67716:0:19:72:527:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:science degrees accrue primarily to those admitted to high-selectivity degree programs, while gains are 
23:778:67820:19:19:72:511:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:largest at lower selectivity levels for education degrees. Admission to more selective degrees in the 
23:779:67922:19:19:72:507:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:humanities and art and architecture leads to earnings losses, although these effects are imprecisely 
23:780:68023:19:19:72:122:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimated.  
23:781:68035:19:19:108:510:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2: As was the case with our estimates by selectivity, our model estimates by field of study are 
23:782:68128:19:19:72:541:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:consistent with existing research. Our estimates generally have the same sign but smaller magnitudes than 
23:783:68234:19:19:72:541:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:prior estimates of conditional correlations based on enrollment or graduation outcomes (rather than causal 
23:784:68341:19:18:72:519:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates of admissions effects).  For example, Altonji et al. (2012) find a difference of 24 log points 
23:785:68446:18:19:72:541:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:(27%) for men who study nursing rather than history; the difference between our estimates of the earnings 
23:786:68552:19:19:72:530:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effect of health degrees relative to humanities degrees is roughly 26%. Altonji et al. find a difference of 
23:787:68660:19:19:72:517:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:30.3 log points (35%) between earnings for biology and elementary education majors; the difference 
23:788:68759:19:19:72:542:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:between our estimates of the earnings effects of science/technology and education degrees is roughly 8%.

23:791:68907:20:19:72:521:442:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Thus far, our discussion has focused on mean effects within selectivity and field of study groups. The 
23:792:69010:19:19:72:514:423:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:distribution of effects within these groups is also of interest. Table 7 presents within-group standard 
23:793:69114:19:19:71:528:404:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:deviations of effect estimates, as well as 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Within-group variation—which 
23:794:69220:19:19:72:542:385:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:includes measurement error—is large relative to between-group effects. Pooling over all degree programs, 
23:795:69325:19:19:72:541:366:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the mean threshold-crossing effect is 0.045, with a standard deviation of 0.241 and a interquartile range of 
23:796:69434:19:19:72:498:347:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:0.237. For the most selective degrees, the mean threshold-crossing effect is 0.091, while the 25th 
23:797:69532:19:19:72:539:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:percentile effect is -0.032 and the 75th percentile effect is 0.242. Overall, however, quantile effects follow 
23:798:69643:19:19:72:540:309:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:a very similar pattern to mean effects. Degree types with higher mean effects tend to exhibit larger effects 
23:799:69752:19:19:72:528:290:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:across quantiles of the effect distribution. This is true for both threshold-crossing and model estimates.  
23:800:69860:19:19:72:535:271:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Figure 8 illustrates these findings with estimates of the densities of effect distributions for selected fields

23:806:70258:19:19:72:527:147:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:not select into degrees in a way that is correlated with heterogeneous degree effects. In this section, we 
23:807:70365:19:19:72:503:128:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:explore the relationship between estimates of heterogeneous earnings effects based on observable 
23:808:70462:19:20:72:542:109:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:characteristics and selection into degree programs. Recall from Section 4 that in our heterogeneous effects 
23:809:70570:20:0:72:530:89:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:models the earnings effect for a given degree program r can be written rgX, where r is a degree-
24:810:70675:0:25:72:524:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:specific intercept term and gX is a vector of interaction dummies between degree field and selectivity 
24:811:70778:25:23:71:530:684:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and a binary or categorical student covariate c. That is, (  , p)ggc. The gXare heterogeneous effects 
24:812:70883:23:19:72:534:661:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for students in category c. To assess the importance of selection on heterogeneity, we estimate equations

24:819:71356:19:22:71:514:514:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:programs where they have comparative advantage. We also consider specifications in which degree-

24:828:72170:19:19:108:521:320:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:There is no evidence that the share of students with high-SES backgrounds, male students, or

24:830:72365:19:19:72:536:282:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:those students. In contrast, students from high-SES backgrounds appear to select into degrees with larger 
24:831:72471:19:19:72:529:263:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degree effects for all students. There is some evidence that male students do as well. These findings are 
24:832:72577:19:19:72:528:244:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:consistent with survey results indicating that students are poorly informed about the earnings outcomes 
24:833:72681:19:19:72:539:225:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:associated with particular degree programs, and with the finding that model estimates of treatment effects 
24:834:72788:19:27:72:472:206:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:are not substantially changed by allowing degree effects to vary with student observables.

24:838:72959:21:19:72:533:94:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Table 9 presents estimates of heterogeneous effects by student socioeconomic background. We focus on 
24:839:73060:19:0:72:526:75:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:estimates from the homogeneous effects model. Table A.VII.II presents parallel estimates of threshold-
25:840:73166:0:19:72:522:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:crossing effects. The upper panel of Table 9 shows that degree effects for high- and low-SES students 
25:841:73268:19:19:72:528:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:follow similar paths as selectivity rises. Effects in the top selectivity quartile reach 22.6% for high-SES 
25:842:73376:19:19:72:522:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:students and 18.4% for low-SES students. Both effects differ statistically from zero at the one percent

25:845:73690:19:19:72:528:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:There are a number of interesting points of contrast. First, students from high-SES backgrounds realize 
25:846:73794:19:19:72:531:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:very large earnings benefits (30.7%) from admission to selective business degrees. The estimated effect 
25:847:73898:19:19:72:528:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for students from low-SES backgrounds is near zero. Second, although the effects of admission to high-
25:848:74000:19:18:72:513:557:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity health degrees are large and positive for both high- and low-SES students, only low-SES 
25:849:74100:18:19:72:385:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:students realize large gains when admitted to low-SES health degrees.  
25:850:74171:19:19:107:519:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Overall, our results suggest that low-SES students on the margin of admission to elite degree 
25:851:74265:19:19:71:535:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:programs can, in many cases, benefit substantially from targeted admissions and scholarship programs.35 
25:852:74368:19:19:72:527:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:However, this may not hold across all fields of study. The finding of near-zero earnings effects for low-
25:853:74473:19:19:72:529:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:SES students at high-selectivity business degrees is consistent with Zimmerman (2014), which presents 
25:854:74575:19:19:72:534:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence that gains in occupational status from admission to elite business-oriented degree programs are 
25:855:74680:19:19:72:453:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:driven by peer ties formed at college between students from elite social backgrounds.

25:857:74862:19:19:72:536:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:women. We find few differences by gender within fields or within selectivity levels. The main exception 
25:858:74966:19:19:72:529:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:is health degrees, where men earn substantially more than women. This segment of the market includes 
25:859:75067:19:19:72:512:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:the most prestigious degrees in medicine (doctors) as well as nurses, pharmacists and other medical 
25:860:75167:19:19:72:531:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:specialties. One interpretation in the literature consistent with our finding of small gender differences in 
25:861:75276:19:19:72:537:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings is that non-pecuniary differences in fields drive choices more than do pecuniary differences. For 
25:862:75383:19:19:72:540:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:example, women may have preferences related to the fraction of women in the field or work schedule and

25:870:75959:15:10:71:539:125:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:lower-caste entrants have positive returns to admission, but that these returns are lower than those for higher-scoring higher-caste 
25:871:76092:10:10:71:514:115:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:members. Our regression discontinuity design implies that scores are on average the same across applicants from different 
25:872:76214:10:7:71:506:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:socioeconomic backgrounds. Conditional on score, lower-SES students appear to gain as much as higher-SES students.

26:878:76842:19:19:108:523:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Because historical information on course requirements in not available, we use current course 
26:879:76936:19:19:72:521:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:requirements as listed on institution websites. Vocational courses include internships and courses that 
26:880:77040:19:19:72:529:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:teach students how to apply skills specific to segments of the labor market. A course on medical device 
26:881:77144:19:19:72:525:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:operation and repair would fall into this category, but a course on chemistry or cell biology would not. 
26:882:77249:19:19:72:537:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Degrees with an above-median fraction of vocational course requirements are categorized as a vocational

26:885:77528:19:19:72:502:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees result in higher earnings. Rather, we find that within selectivity tiers, degrees with a core-
26:886:77630:19:19:72:506:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:curriculum focus lead to larger earnings gains. One interpretation of these findings is that students 
26:887:77732:19:19:72:520:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:receiving broad training in logic and language skills may more successfully adapt to a changing labor 
26:888:77834:19:22:72:376:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:market over their career, resulting in larger long-run earnings gains.

26:891:77949:22:19:72:511:422:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:One concern is that the benefits students realize from admission to different degrees may simply be 
26:892:78049:19:19:72:511:403:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:captured by universities through higher tuition costs. Because tuition and matriculation data are not 
26:893:78151:19:18:72:540:384:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:systematically available for earlier years, we construct estimates of the direct costs of college for the 2007

26:895:78365:20:18:72:513:346:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We compute total costs for marginal admitted students over the six years following application, and 
26:896:78465:18:19:72:535:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:compare them to our homogeneous effects model estimates. We interpret the side-by-side comparison as

26:899:78769:19:19:72:529:271:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:viewed cautiously, because they take into account neither lost early-career earnings nor possible tuition 
26:900:78875:19:19:72:524:252:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:expenses at non-selective degrees, which accounted for a large share of enrollment by the late 2000s.   
26:901:78979:19:19:107:528:233:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:  Table 10 shows the estimated earnings gains and tuition costs by field and selectivity tier.  The 
26:902:79079:19:19:72:509:214:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:highest earning field, health, has the highest tuition, but tuition costs are small relative to increased

26:904:79291:19:19:72:527:176:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:worst deal, with lower expected earnings gains and similar tuition costs to social science, business, and 
26:905:79397:19:19:72:540:157:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:science/technology degrees.  To make this comparison more concrete, we compute the present discounted 
26:906:79499:19:41:72:518:138:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:values of tuition payments and expected earnings gains over the life cycle (PDVs).38 PDVs of health,

26:908:79660:7:16:72:497:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:38 We assume an interest rate of 6%, and that earnings benefits accrue for years 7 through 48 of following 
26:909:79767:16:0:72:276:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:application, or approximately ages 25 through 65.  
27:910:79822:0:19:72:533:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:social science, law, and technology degrees are positive, while PDVs for art/architecture and humanities 
27:911:79927:19:19:72:213:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees are large and negative.  
27:912:79960:19:19:108:525:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Tuition costs increase with selectivity of the degree. The most selective degrees charge almost 
27:913:80056:19:19:72:517:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:two times more tuition than the least selective degrees. However, expected annual earnings gains are 
27:914:80157:19:19:72:530:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:almost five times as high. PDV calculations suggest that low-selectivity degrees have a negative return, 
27:915:80262:19:19:72:519:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:while the returns to the most selective degrees are large and positive.  Institutions do not appear to be

27:919:80498:22:19:72:540:528:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Across a variety of specifications, we find that admission to selective degrees and degrees with a focus on 
27:920:80606:19:19:72:537:509:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:health, social science, or science/technology yield positive and significant earnings gains. These gains do 
27:921:80714:19:19:72:534:490:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:not appear to be fully captured by higher tuition.  Our results are consistent with a number of underlying 
27:922:80821:19:19:72:532:471:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:mechanisms. One possibility is that admission to more selective degree programs or degree programs in 
27:923:80923:19:19:72:536:452:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:certain fields tends to raise overall educational attainment and college graduation rates, which may affect 
27:924:81031:19:19:72:530:433:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:earnings through signaling or human capital accumulation. Cohodes and Goodman (2014), Goodman et 
27:925:81128:19:19:72:506:414:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:al. (2014), and Zimmerman (2014) provide evidence from the U.S. that attending a more selective 
27:926:81224:19:19:72:529:395:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:university tends to raise graduation rates.  Using matriculation and graduation records from 2000-2011, 
27:927:81328:19:19:72:529:376:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Online Appendix section VIII shows how matriculation translates into degree completion by selectivity 
27:928:81430:19:19:72:520:357:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:and field of study. Overall, more selective degrees are more effective at graduating students; students 
27:929:81534:19:19:72:534:338:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:crossing the threshold into a more selective degree are about 1.73 times more likely to graduate from the 
27:930:81640:19:18:72:534:319:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:target degree than students crossing a threshold into a less-selective degree are. Graduation and earnings 
27:931:81747:18:19:72:536:301:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:gains are linked through student choice: if students realize after matriculation that their degree will result 
27:932:81858:19:19:71:538:282:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:in lower earnings than expected they may be inclined to drop out sooner (Hastings et al. 2013a). They are 
27:933:81964:19:19:72:540:263:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:both likely correlated with student ability and socioeconomic status as well. Decomposing the factors that 
27:934:82071:19:28:72:520:244:121:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contribute to the high returns observed for selective degrees is an important area for future research.

27:937:82192:26:19:72:528:156:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:We exploit discontinuous admissions rules at more than 1,100 degree programs to examine the way the 
27:938:82292:19:19:72:512:137:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:effects of college admission on labor market earnings vary by degree selectivity, field of study, and 
27:939:82394:19:19:72:541:118:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:student background. We find statistically and economically significant heterogeneity in the earnings gains 
27:940:82501:19:0:72:531:99:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:associated with crossing an admissions threshold by selectivity and field of study. These differences are 
28:941:82611:0:19:72:530:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:not driven by correlations in preferences and/or unobserved skill (e.g. Dahl, 2002), as both are balanced 
28:942:82717:19:19:71:202:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:across admission thresholds.  
28:943:82747:19:19:107:531:671:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:In addition to presenting threshold-crossing estimates, we use variation in admissions outcomes 
28:944:82843:19:19:71:536:652:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:generated by the set of discontinuities to identify a simple model of earnings determination that accounts 
28:945:82950:19:19:71:537:633:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for differences in below-threshold educational outcomes across degree programs. These estimates, which 
28:946:83053:19:19:71:527:614:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:rely on assumptions about the choice process that we test using a combination of in-sample and survey 
28:947:83155:19:19:71:538:595:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:evidence, allow us to draw policy-relevant conclusions about the earnings effects of each degree program 
28:948:83260:19:18:71:524:576:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:relative to a common baseline of not attending any selective degree program. Model estimates suggest 
28:949:83361:18:19:71:524:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:that earnings gains grow more with selectivity than indicated by threshold-crossing results alone. Low 
28:950:83464:19:19:71:526:539:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:selectivity degrees do not raise earnings very much on average, with degrees in the health field being a 
28:951:83569:19:19:71:536:520:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:notable exception. Our results provide insight into a number of policy debates. Earnings gains associated 
28:952:83675:19:19:71:524:501:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:with admission to highly selective degrees are just as large for students from low-SES backgrounds as 
28:953:83777:19:19:71:541:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:those for students from high-SES backgrounds. This is consistent with the idea that interventions aimed at 
28:954:83884:19:19:71:533:463:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:helping poor but qualified students gain admission to elite universities is welfare improving (Hoxby and 
28:955:83989:19:19:71:528:444:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Turner 2013). Students from high-SES backgrounds benefit disproportionately from access to selective 
28:956:84090:19:19:71:523:425:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:business degrees, consistent with findings from Zimmerman (2014) that occupational gains from such 
28:957:84189:19:19:71:537:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:degrees are largely driven by peer ties formed between students from wealthy backgrounds. We also find 
28:958:84292:19:19:71:542:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:little evidence of differing earnings returns for men and women. This suggests that the large differences in 
28:959:84401:19:19:71:542:368:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:major choice for men and women (Turner and Bowen 1999; Zafar 2013) may be driven not by differences 
28:960:84501:19:19:71:402:349:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:in earnings outcomes, but by differences in non-pecuniary characteristics.  
28:961:84577:19:19:107:512:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:More broadly, our findings suggest that frictions exist in the markets that match students to 
28:962:84671:19:19:71:523:311:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:postsecondary degrees. Constraints on the supply of high-return degrees (see Bound and Turner 2007; 
28:963:84771:19:19:71:513:292:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Zimmerman 2014) may push students into programs with lower economic returns at many margins. 
28:964:84864:19:19:71:529:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Admitting the marginal applicant to a high-return program by lowering the score cutoff a small amount 
28:965:84966:19:19:71:532:254:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:would likely have a positive social return. At the same time, we observe excess demand for degrees that 
28:966:85070:19:19:71:539:235:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:do not raise earnings for admitted students. This could be because these degrees offer high non-pecuniary 
28:967:85176:19:19:71:515:216:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:compensation that is valued by all students, or because some students have very strong tastes for the 
28:968:85278:19:19:71:308:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:coursework or careers associated with these degrees.  
28:969:85332:19:19:107:522:178:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:Hastings et al. (2014a) present evidence suggesting that students may base college choices on 
28:970:85426:19:19:71:493:159:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:beliefs about economic returns that are systematically biased and uninformed. The existence of 
28:971:85521:19:19:71:515:140:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:oversubscribed degrees with zero or negative returns thus suggests two possible avenues for welfare-
28:972:85621:19:19:71:518:121:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:improving policy intervention. First, if information aggregation is a public good, policymakers could 
28:973:85723:19:19:71:531:102:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:supply centralized ranking and earnings information to provide students with added information needed 
28:974:85825:19:0:71:531:83:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:for making life-long decisions (Beyer et al. 2014, Hastings et al. 2014a,b). Second, loan policy could be 
29:975:85935:0:19:72:539:709:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:used to provide additional supply-side incentives to ease frictions in supply of high-return degrees (Beyer
