2:27:1363:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:28:1371:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  present  a  model  in  which  prospective  patients  are  liquidity  constrained,  and  thus  health 
2:29:1476:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:insurance allows patients access to treatments and services that they otherwise would have been 
2:30:1571:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:unable  to  afford. Consistent  with  large  expansions  of  insurance  in  the  U.S.  (e.g.,  the  Affordable 
2:31:1681:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:Care Act), we assume that policies expand the set of services that must be covered by insurance. 
2:32:1777:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:We show that the profit-maximizing price for an innovative treatment is greater in the presence of 
2:33:1875:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:health  insurance  than  it  would  be  for an  uninsured  population.  We  also  show  that  consumer 
2:34:1977:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:surplus is less than it would be if the innovation was not covered. These results show that even in 
2:35:2076:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:the  absence  of  moral  hazard,  there  are  channels  through which  insurance  can  negatively  affect 
2:36:2181:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:consumer   welfare.   Our   model   also   provides   an   economic   rationale for   the   claim   that 
2:37:2285:14:14:71:545:462:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:C:pharmaceutical  firms  set  prices  that  exceed  the  value  their  products  create.  We  empirically 
2:38:2388:14:14:71:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:examine  our  model's  predictions  by  studying  the  pricing  of  oncology  drugs  following  the  2003 
2:39:2494:14:14:71:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:passage of  Medicare  Part  D.  Prior  to  2003,  drugs  covered  under  Medicare  Part  B  had  higher 
2:40:2597:14:14:71:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:prices than those that would eventually be covered under Part D. In general, the trends in pricing 
2:41:2695:14:14:71:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:C:across  these  categories were  similar.  However,  after  2003  there  was  a  far  greater  increase  in 
2:42:2801:14:14:71:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:C:prices for products covered under Part D, and as result, products covered by both programs were 
2:43:2896:14:14:71:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:C:sold at similar prices. In addition, these prices were quite high compared to the value created by 
2:44:2994:14:14:71:545:364:12:Times:12:Times:C:the  products---suggesting  that  the  forced  bundle of  Part  D  might  have  allowed  firms  to  capture 
2:45:3101:14:41:71:258:350:12:Times:12:Times:C:more value than their products created.

3:91:5497:38:24:72:185:321:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:1  Introduction
3:92:5512:24:15:72:540:297:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The welfare economics of insurance traditionally involves a trade-o§ between consumption smoothing and
3:93:5614:15:15:72:540:282:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:moral hazard. The potential welfare e§ects of these two features of health insurance have been extensively
3:94:5720:15:15:72:540:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:studied (Pauly, 1968; Feldstein, 1973; Friedman, 1974; Feldman and Dowd, 1991; Manning and Marquis,
3:95:5819:15:15:72:540:252:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:1989, 1996; Newhouse, 1993; Einavet al., 2013).  Nyman (1999) identiÖes the elimination of liquidity
3:96:5919:15:15:72:540:237:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constraints for the purchasing of costly medical services as a third feature of health insurance.  While
3:97:6023:15:15:72:540:222:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:eliminating liquidity constraints likely improves access to expensive medical products, little is known about
3:98:6132:15:15:72:282:207:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the welfare implications of this increased access.
3:99:6182:15:15:86:539:192:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:On the one hand, Nyman (1999) proposes that the access beneÖts of health insurance result in a large
3:100:6282:15:15:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase in consumer surplus in the following manner: ìif insurance is the only way to gain access to expensive
3:101:6393:15:15:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:health care, then the value of insurance for that care is the expected consumer surplus from the health care
3:102:6501:15:15:72:540:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services that would otherwise be inaccessible. This value may be large, especially if the procedures that
3:103:6606:15:14:72:257:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance made possible were life-saving.î

4:116:7751:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity constraints, these expansions also expanded and solidiÖed regulations regarding the set of products

4:118:7950:15:15:86:539:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper we examine the welfare implications of increased access to expensive medical services by
4:119:8052:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:providing a demand model that incorporates two salient features of the United States pharmaceutical market:
4:120:8159:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(1) liquidity constrained customers and (2) Örms selling medical goods and services in both competitive and
4:121:8266:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:monopoly markets that are covered by a single insurance bundle. We use this model to examine pricing and
4:122:8370:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consumer welfare in the pharmaceutical sectoró a market that is characterized by many products with high
4:123:8474:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and rising prices that sometimes exceed the value directly created by the product. These unprecedented high
4:124:8581:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices have recently received considerable attention from both policymakers and economists including calls
4:125:8687:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for both direct (e.g. explicit price controls) and indirect (e.g. increased bargaining rights for government

4:127:8901:15:15:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:could come from such policies, it is important to understand the determinants of the marketís prices and
4:128:9005:15:14:72:169:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:their e§ect on welfare.
4:129:9028:14:15:86:539:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Broadly speaking, the expensive branded drugs attracting attention fall into two categories.3The Örst
4:130:9129:15:15:71:539:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:category includes speciality medications that o§er treatments for life threatening and/or severely debilitating
4:131:9240:15:15:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:conditions. These drugs carry hefty price tags but the prices are lower than estimates of the value of the
4:132:9346:15:15:71:539:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:statistical lives saved by the products. Despite the positive beneÖt/cost ratio, the proÖts generated by these
4:133:9456:15:15:71:538:381:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:B:new products have attracted a great deal of negative attention from policymakers and the general public.4
4:134:9561:15:15:71:539:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The poster children for this Örst category are Sovaldi and Harvoni, two drugs developed by Gilead for the
4:135:9666:15:15:71:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment of hepatitis C. These drugs o§er a marked improvement over existing treatments and initially
4:136:9768:15:15:71:539:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:were sold at a price of $80,000 for a 12 week course of treatment. Given their e¢ cacy and price, they have
4:137:9875:15:15:71:539:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:attracted many customers and generated approximately $10 billion in proÖts in 2014 (Slatko, 2015). Despite
4:138:9981:15:15:71:539:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these high prices, Sovaldi represents such a leap forward in the treatment of hepatitis C that it is estimated
4:139:10091:15:15:71:438:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to be cost e§ective (Liu et al., 2015; Chhatwal et al., 2015; Najafzadeh et al., 2015).
4:140:10178:15:15:86:539:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The second category includes drugs that provide some beneÖt to patients but are sold at prices that
4:141:10277:15:15:71:539:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appear to exceed the value that they create.  This category includes many recently introduced oncology
4:142:10379:15:14:71:539:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products as well products that treat a wide number of other conditions. For example, when used to treat
4:143:10482:14:13:85:539:232:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:1For  example,  a  white  paper  prepared  by  Senate  Democrats  in  support  of  the  Patient  Protection  and  Af-

4:147:10933:9:10:89:539:191:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:These regulations are both explicit and implicit.  For Medicare Part D, the regulations cover what types of products must
4:148:11054:10:9:72:540:181:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:be covered and many private insurance companies have adopted these standards.  For the ACA, the legislation and subsequent
4:149:11176:9:10:72:540:172:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:regulations established a set of services that must be covered for qualify as insurance for the purposes of the individual mandates
4:150:11307:10:9:72:88:162:8:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:F:to purchase insurance.3
4:151:11330:9:10:89:539:153:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:In addition there have been recent increases in the prices for generic drugs serving small markets.  This primariliy relates
4:152:11454:10:9:72:540:143:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:to the minimum e¢ cient scale relative to the market size for these small patient populations and are generally beyond the scope
4:153:11582:9:9:72:540:134:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:of this paper (except to note that the proÖt maximizing price for these generic medications is likely far lower for an uninsured
4:154:11710:9:7:72:117:125:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:population).
4:155:11722:7:12:85:539:118:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:4For example, Gilead was forced to justify to Congress the high prices it charged for its hepatitis C cure and was subsequently
4:156:11849:12:10:72:540:106:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the target of an 18 month investigation by the Senate Finance committee (Pollack, 2014; Berkrot, 2015). This attention to
4:157:11970:10:9:72:540:96:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:prices is driven, in part, by the belief that the total potential liability insurers face from specialty pharmaceutical products will
4:158:12103:9:10:72:540:87:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:lead to higher premiums and reduced access in the private market, as well as create budget problems for public programs. Steve

5:164:12751:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on e¢ cacy and the standard value of life years gained for the recently developed PCSK9 Inhibitors such as

5:167:12977:15:15:86:539:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Our model helps explain both the high prices of recently developed valuable pharmaceuticals and the
5:168:13076:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:puzzling ability of Örms to sell products at prices that exceed the value created by their products.  We
5:169:13180:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also examine the welfare consequences of the access to expensive pharmaceuticals that insurance provides.
5:170:13285:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We begin by noting that the average uninsured customer appears to be liquidity constrained in the market
5:171:13389:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for expensive branded pharmaceuticals. In 2011, the median United States household had a net worth of
5:172:13490:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approximately $68,000, with nearly $50,000 of that wealth being home equity.6In addition, survey evidence
5:173:13595:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reports that roughly 75 percent of people with incomes less than $50,000 and 67 percent of individuals with
5:174:13702:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 would have di¢ culty coming up with $1,000 to pay an unexpected
5:175:13802:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expense (Sweet and Swanson, 2016). Since most banks would not provide an unsecured loan for medical
5:176:13901:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services, uninsured individuals Önd themselves without the Önancial means to a§ord a large fraction of these
5:177:14009:15:15:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:new expensive treatments. It therefore seems probable that at current prices, many potential patients would
5:178:14116:15:15:72:482:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have to forego treatment with many of these new high priced drugs, were it not for insurance.
5:179:14209:15:14:86:539:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Given these facts, Nymanís conclusion that insurance creates an access beneÖt for enrollees seems to
5:180:14309:14:15:72:539:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be correct, especially for new high priced drugs.7However, understanding the welfare implications of this
5:181:14414:15:15:71:539:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:beneÖt requires carefully considering the optimal pricing response of pharmaceutical Örms.8These potential
5:182:14520:15:15:71:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pricing decisions can be quite meaningful and failing to consider the supply side response to health insurance
5:183:14630:15:15:71:539:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:therefore can have important welfare implications. For example, it is di¢ cult to imagine that Gilead would
5:184:14737:15:15:71:539:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:charge anywhere near $84,000 for Sovaldi were it not covered by insurance and therefore the existence of
5:185:14841:15:15:71:382:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance for this product has clear implications for access and pricing.
5:186:14914:15:15:86:539:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate this point we develop a simple demand model, where individuals may purchase insurance for a
5:187:15019:15:15:71:539:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:"core" set of medical services (i.e. existing hospital and physician services as well as more competitively priced
5:188:15133:15:15:71:539:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pharmaceuticals) and a potentially life-saving innovative product (e.g. a new pharmaceutical treatment for
5:189:15239:15:15:71:539:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:cancer). With this model we address Öve distinct questions that have heretofore been unaddressed by the
5:190:15342:15:15:71:539:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:literature: (1) To what extent might the unprecedented high prices of new prescription drugs depend on
5:191:15444:15:15:71:539:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the liquidity beneÖts of insurance? (2) Would consumers be better o§ if these drugs were not insured? (3)
5:192:15549:15:15:71:539:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:How does bundling innovative products sold by patent-holding Örms and ìcoreîmedical services in a single

5:194:15758:15:15:71:501:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:value?  (5) How does the growing fragmentation of the pharmaceutical marketplace a§ect pricing?
5:195:15853:15:15:86:539:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:While our model is too stylized to o§er precise numerical predictions, a canonical example that broadly
5:196:15956:15:15:71:539:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Öts real world data conÖrms some of the modelís surprising implications. First, we show that the proÖt-
5:197:16059:15:14:71:539:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing price for products is far greater in the presence of health insurance than it would be for an
5:198:16163:14:15:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:uninsured population, and consumer surplus is lower. The decrease in consumer surplus is quite large and
5:199:16267:15:15:71:539:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:exceeds the consumption smoothing beneÖts of health insurance for these products. We further show that
5:200:16369:15:12:85:539:142:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:5While list prices are not often paid by insurers, the nations largest pharmacy beneÖt manager noted that they did not
5:201:16487:12:7:72:437:130:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:receive the cost e§ective price following their negotiations related to these drugs (Managan, 2015).
5:202:16587:7:10:85:420:123:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:6Data available at: http://www.census.gov/people/wealth/Öles/Wealth_Tables_2011.xlsx
5:203:16671:10:12:85:539:113:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:7We also note that the fact that liquidity constraints may place the willingness to pay of customers below the social value of
5:204:16797:12:9:72:540:101:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:a good is not limited to the area of health care or health insurance. Fuchs, Green, and Levine (2013) develop a model describing
5:205:16925:9:10:72:540:92:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the optimal subsidies for mosquito bednets in developing countries where liquidity constraints result in the willingness to pay
5:206:17052:10:9:72:88:82:8:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f3:F:for these products to be below their social value.8
5:207:17103:9:10:89:539:73:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:Nymanís model makes the strong assumption of Öxed prices and this shortcoming drives the erroneous conclusion that the
5:208:17221:10:0:72:277:63:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:access motive for insurance increases consumer surplus.
6:209:17277:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this negative e§ect on consumer welfare grows as the number of innovative products increases.  In fact,
6:210:17380:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as the number of innovative products covered by insurance increases, the high prices they charge for their
6:211:17486:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products eventually cause some consumers to not purchase insurance, resulting in a decrease in total surplus.
6:212:17595:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We note that these results do not rely on moral hazard in that it exists even when customers never buy
6:213:17697:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a product at a price that exceeds its value.  Therefore, these results show that even in a situation where
6:214:17803:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurers could eliminate moral hazard (either through well designed cost sharing or e§ective managed care
6:215:17908:15:15:72:458:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:organizations) there are still other channels through which insurance can reduce welfare.
6:216:17997:15:15:86:539:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, our model provides an economic explanation for the common claim that Örms in the phar-
6:217:18096:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:maceutical sector are able to successfully set prices that far exceed the value created by their products
6:218:18201:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(Loftus, 2015; Walker, 2015). It is true that insured consumers donít directly pay the cost of drugs, and this
6:219:18311:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:might lead to moral hazard in their purchasing decisions. However, it is also true that if all manufacturers
6:220:18419:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:priced above the value created, the resulting insurance premiums would push consumers out of the insurance
6:221:18525:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market.  This e§ect on insurance premiums means that even if insured customers exhibit moral hazard,
6:222:18625:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the monopoly providersípricing should be constrained by the value created by their products. However,
6:223:18726:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our model demonstrates that requiring insurers to provide a single bundle including existing basic medical
6:224:18832:15:15:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services and innovative treatments allows the monopoly manufacturers of innovative products to set prices
6:225:18937:15:15:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that capture some of the value created in the more competitive market for other health services, value that
6:226:19044:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:was previously consumer surplus. This would explain recent examples of oncology and cardiovascular prod-
6:227:19148:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ucts that are covered by health insurance and have been found to not be cost e§ective, but whose prices
6:228:19251:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are accepted by insurers (Johnson, 2015; Magnan, 2015). We note that the ability of Örms to capture more
6:229:19355:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:value than they create solely results from regulations requiring an insurance bundle and that without these
6:230:19462:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:regulations, even in the presence of moral hazard, a monopolist selling an innovative product would be
6:231:19564:15:15:72:398:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constrained by the e§ect that its price would have on insurance premiums.
6:232:19637:15:15:86:539:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To empirically examine our modelís predictions we examine the pricing of oncology drugs following the
6:233:19738:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2003 passage of Medicare Part D. While the widespread adoption of insurance in the American market
6:234:19836:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:makes Önding an ideal empirical setting for testing our model di¢ cult, there are many features of the
6:235:19938:15:15:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oncology market and Medicare Part D that are useful for this purpose. First, Part D required that oncology
6:236:20044:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products had to be covered which allows the producers of newly launched products in this category to exert
6:237:20150:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a large amount of market power when setting prices. Second, a number of oncology products were previously
6:238:20255:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covered by Medicare because those products were primarily administered in a physicianís o¢ ce or outpatient
6:239:20362:15:15:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:setting (and thus are covered under Medicareís Part B medical beneÖt rather than the Part D pharmaceutical
6:240:20468:15:15:72:108:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:beneÖt).
6:241:20476:15:15:86:539:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We exploit this fact to identify the e§ect of insurance on pharmaceutical pricing by Örst examining the
6:242:20579:15:15:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:general trends occurring in the oncology market and then separately examining products based on insurance
6:243:20684:15:15:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:coverage. While there are a relatively small number of oncology products, we show that prices were generally
6:244:20792:15:14:72:540:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:stable until 2003 and then increased rapidly in the years following. This increase would be consistent with
6:245:20899:14:15:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:both the greater share of the population with insurance and the bundling of new products under patent with
6:246:21005:15:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:those that are sold in a more competitive market. To further examine these prices, we next compare the
6:247:21107:15:15:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:change in prices for products based on whether they are covered under Part D and Part B. We Önd that
6:248:21207:15:15:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prior to 2003, drugs covered under Part B were far more expensive than those that would eventually be
6:249:21308:15:15:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covered under Part D. In general, the trends in pricing across these categories were áat and similar before
6:250:21415:15:15:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2003. However, after that year there was a far greater increase in prices for products covered under Part D.
6:251:21523:15:15:72:540:82:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:As a result, in the years following 2003, products covered by both programs were sold at similar prices. In
6:252:21630:15:0:72:540:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:addition, these prices were quite high compared to the value created by the products ñsuggesting that the
7:253:21736:0:15:72:513:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:forced bundle of Part D might have allowed Örms to capture more value than their products created.
7:254:21834:15:15:86:539:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, our model provides suggestive explanations for the recent increase in new high priced pharma-
7:255:21936:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ceutical products and the increases for existing products. We show that Örms must consider at least two
7:256:22039:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:factors when setting the price of their pharmaceutical: (1) the value created by their product; (2) the exter-
7:257:22149:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:nality of their price on the premiums for insurance and therefore the purchase of other pharmaceuticals. Our
7:258:22257:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:results with multiple innovative products, sold by di§erent Örms, suggest that as the number of innovators
7:259:22363:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase there is a commensurate increase in prices and above a certain level a decrease in total surplus.
7:260:22469:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This result stems from the Cournot complementary monopolist problem where each innovator is pricing
7:261:22568:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:without internalizing its e§ect on the market. However, Örms marketing a portfolio of innovative products
7:262:22673:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:must internalize this negative externality to a greater degree than Örms that are marketing a single product.
7:263:22782:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We document that the time period of recent price increases has been coincident with a marked reduction in
7:264:22887:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the concentration of sales in the pharmaceutical sectoró providing an economic rationale for the recent price
7:265:22996:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increases. We note that this is not simply a conventional market structure-to-price relationship, as many of
7:266:23104:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the drugs in question held monopoly or near monopoly status over this time period. Rather, the reduction
7:267:23208:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in concentration encourages Örms to ignore the externality that their high prices impose on the rest of the
7:268:23315:15:15:72:310:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:industry through their impact on insurance premiums.
7:269:23367:15:15:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and analyzes a model of pric-
7:270:23468:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ing a pharmaceutical product in the face of consumer liquidity constraints. We Örst consider the case in
7:271:23572:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which insurance does not cover the treatment, and then we consider what happens when the treatment is
7:272:23673:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covered. For both cases, we characterize consumersíoptimal purchase decisions and the implied demand
7:273:23773:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:curve for the treatment; the proÖt-maximizing price of the treatment; and the resulting levels of consumer
7:274:23879:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and total surplus. Section 3 extends our model to encompass multiple innovators. Section 4 incorporates a
7:275:23984:15:15:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consumption-smoothing motive for insurance into our model and discusses how it a§ects our results. Section
7:276:24090:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:5 studies the impact of minimum insurance coverage standards. Section 6 contains the empirical analysis
7:277:24193:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of Medicare Part D and oncology products, and Section 7 applies the model to provide insight into the role
7:278:24299:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:played by insurance in recent instances of high drug prices. Section 8 summarizes and concludes. Proofs of
7:279:24405:15:37:72:409:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:all propositions and derivations of some key expressions are in the Appendix.
7:280:24482:37:25:72:172:284:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:2  The model
7:281:24494:25:15:72:540:259:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The focus of our analysis is the pricing of a single innovative treatment for a serious but rare illness. In
7:282:24602:15:15:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Section 3, we extend the model to consider treatments for several di§erent innovators. As in Nyman (1998,
7:283:24707:15:15:72:540:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:1999), consumers are assumed to be risk neutral, and so the consumption-smoothing motive for insurance is
7:284:24812:15:15:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:absent.9Potential consumers of the innovative treatment (hereafter the treatment) di§er only in the amount

7:286:25000:15:25:86:447:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A consumer can be in one of three possible mutually exclusive states,s=f0;1;2g:
7:287:25079:25:23:86:392:159:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f3:A:-s= 0: The consumer is healthy and does not need medical services.
7:288:25145:23:15:86:542:136:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f3:A:-s= 1: The consumer experiences a medical condition for which a package of well-established ìcoreî
7:289:25243:15:23:96:217:121:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:medical services is required.
7:290:25272:23:14:86:490:98:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f3:A:-s= 2: The consumer experiences the illness for which an innovative treatment is required.
7:291:25362:14:10:85:269:84:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:9We discuss consumption smoothing in Section 4.
7:292:25409:10:12:82:539:74:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:10The choice of the uniform density allows us to compute exact formulas for prices, quantities, and surpluses. None of our
7:293:25531:12:0:72:262:62:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:key intuitions depends on the uniform distribution.
8:294:25583:0:15:86:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The probability of state 1 is-C2(0;1); the probability of state 2 is-I2(0;1), and the probability of
8:295:25683:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:state 0 is1--C--I>0. Think of state 1 as the occurrence of a medical condition (e.g., a heart attack) for
8:296:25788:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which procedures, protocols, and treatments are well understood. The cost of treating these conditions may
8:297:25894:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be high, but their beneÖts are likely to be higher, and because they are well established, these core medical
8:298:26003:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services would typically be covered under conventional health insurance plans. State 2, on the other hand, is
8:299:26112:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a serious but relatively rare illness for which an innovative, high value-added pharmaceutical treatment has
8:300:26220:15:15:72:539:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:only recently emerged.11Throughout the analysis, we will treat-Cas ìsomewhat smallî and-Ias ìvery

8:316:27019:15:15:72:540:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment. Note that the treatment has value only when the consumer develops the serious illness, and core
8:317:27125:15:15:72:540:419:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:medical services only have value when the consumer develops the medical condition for which those services
8:318:27231:15:15:72:474:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are appropriate.12The utility losses plays no essential role in our analysis, so we setFs= 0.
8:319:27324:15:15:86:540:389:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The price of core medical services is assumed to be determined competitively and equalsC2[0; B). By
8:320:27423:15:15:72:539:374:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, the pricePof the treatment is determined monopolistically by the innovator of the treatment. For
8:321:27529:15:15:72:540:359:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:simplicity, the innovatorís marginal cost is assumed to be 0. This innovatorís price is endogenous, and its
8:322:27636:15:14:72:264:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:determination is a key focus of our analysis.
8:323:27681:14:15:86:539:330:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Consumers have the opportunity to purchase health insurance. We consider two alternative forms of
8:324:27778:15:15:72:540:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:health insurance:basic health insurance, which covers just core medical services but not the treatment and
8:325:27884:15:15:72:540:300:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f3:B:expanded health insurance, which covers both core medical services and the treatment.  Under the basic
8:326:27986:15:15:72:540:285:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:health insurance plan, the individual pays a price of0for core medical services but the full pricePfor
8:327:28088:15:15:72:540:270:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment. Under the expanded health insurance plan, the price for both core medical services and the
8:328:28193:15:15:72:540:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment is0. A consumer who does not purchase health insurance pays the full price for both core medical
8:329:28299:15:15:72:540:240:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services and the treatment. When the treatment is included on the health planís formulary, we assume that
8:330:28404:15:15:72:540:225:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consumers cannot purchasea la carte. That is, a consumer cannot purchase coverage only for the treatment
8:331:28508:15:15:72:539:210:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:or only for core medical services.13This is consistent with rules of what constitutes insurance under the
8:332:28613:15:15:72:170:195:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:B:A§ordable Care Act.14
8:333:28634:15:15:86:539:180:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Health insurance is sold in a competitive market, so it has an actuarially fair premium.  When the
8:334:28732:15:15:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment is not covered, that premium is-CC.  When the treatment is covered, the planís premium is
8:335:28831:15:14:72:124:150:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f3:B:-CC+-IP.
8:336:28839:14:10:82:484:136:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:11Below we extend the model to include multiple serious illnesses, each having its own innovative treatment.
8:337:28947:10:12:82:539:126:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:12It would not be di¢ cult to extend our model so thatBdepended on wealth. However, our major insights and intuitions
8:338:29064:12:7:71:468:114:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:would not change if we did so, and makingBindependent of wealth simpliÖes the exposition of the model.
8:339:29166:7:12:82:539:107:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:13As we discuss below, the basic economics of the case when insurance for the treatment is decoupled from insurance can be

8:341:29350:7:12:82:539:88:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:14Note that insurers play an entirely passive role in this model. For example, if the price of the treatment increases, this is
8:342:29477:12:9:72:540:76:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:entirely translated into higher premiums. As an alternative to premium increases, insurers might instead increase cost sharing
8:343:29603:9:10:72:540:67:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:requirements. While the qualitative implications for demand and pricing strategies are similar, the mechanism through which
8:344:29726:10:0:72:470:57:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:a§ects drug purchases is more complex. We therefore do not consider this alternative to premium increases

9:346:29892:42:15:86:540:372:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:A consumerís choice problem proceeds in two stages. Before learning the states, an individual chooses
9:347:29993:15:15:72:540:357:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whether to purchase a health insurance plan. Then, depending on the individualís Örst-stage choice and the
9:348:30099:15:15:72:540:342:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:realized state, the individual choosesxi,yi, andzi. Figure 1 summarizes the timing of both consumer choice
9:349:30205:15:15:72:160:327:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and market activity.
9:350:30225:15:25:86:355:312:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Throughout the analysis, we make the following assumptions:
9:351:30284:25:15:72:539:287:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Assumption 1The incremental value of the treatmentVi=v(cWi)is increasing in wealth and is such that
9:352:30383:15:24:72:216:272:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f7:C:v(cWi)>cWifor allcWi2[cW;cW].
9:353:30412:24:25:72:421:248:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Assumption 2cW+ 1< C, i.e., no consumer can a§ord core medical services.
9:354:30484:25:25:72:431:223:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Assumption 3cW> -CC, i.e., every consumer can a§ord basic health insurance.
9:355:30559:25:15:72:539:198:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Assumption 4-Iv(cW+ 1)< -C(B-C), i.e., the expected social value of the treatment is less than the
9:356:30657:15:25:72:268:183:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:expected social value of core medical services.
9:357:30704:25:15:86:539:158:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Assumption 1 is consistent with evidence that the income elasticity of the value of life is positive (Viscusi
9:358:30813:15:15:72:539:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Aldy, 2003).15However, the assumption thatVi>cWimay seem less natural: after all, why would an
9:359:30911:15:15:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:individual value something at more than their own ability to pay for it inasmuch as standard economic theory
9:360:31019:15:15:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:equates value with the willingness to pay. Following standard theory, we would conclude that someone who
9:361:31123:15:15:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:has, say, only $1,000 in liquid assets and therefore does not purchase a $2,000 life-saving treatment must value
9:362:31235:15:12:82:539:83:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:15Assumption 1 is also in line with Beckerís (2007) model of health as human capital. Equation (1) in that article expresses
9:363:31359:12:9:72:540:71:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the statistical value of life as a function of wealth and expected survivorship, and it is assumed that the valuation of a given
9:364:31487:9:0:72:355:62:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:improvement in survivorshipóViin our modeló is ìrising in initial wealth.î
10:365:31562:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that treatment at less than $2,000. However, this revealed preference logic ignores the reality of liquidity
10:366:31670:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constraints. Assumption 1 is tantamount to saying that if people could borrow against future earnings to
10:367:31774:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:save their lives, everyone would do so.  We can put this another way: suppose that you encountered a
10:368:31874:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gunman who gave the choice of ìyour liquid assets or your life.îIf the value of your life was capped by your
10:369:31982:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:liquid assets, then you would necessarily be indi§erent between these two choices. Yet you, and surely most
10:370:32089:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:everyone, would strongly prefer keeping your life over keeping your liquid assets. Your life must be worth
10:371:32195:15:15:72:96:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:more.
10:372:32200:15:15:86:539:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:With respect to the other assumptions, Assumption 2 is plausible in a setting characterized by signiÖcant
10:373:32305:15:15:72:539:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:medical cost ináation, as in the U.S.16A justiÖcation for Assumption 3 is that wealth levelscWiare inclusive
10:374:32413:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of subsidies for the purchase of health insurance, as under the A§ordable Care Act. Assumptions 2 and
10:375:32514:15:15:72:538:560:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:B:3 create a potential access motive to obtain basic health insurance in the spirit of Nyman (1998, 1999).17
10:376:32620:15:15:71:539:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, Assumption 4 is plausible in light of the notion that the serious illness is rare, while the core medical
10:377:32734:15:15:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services cover an array of established treatments that have su¢ ciently high valueBwhen needed.  We
10:378:32833:15:15:71:539:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:discuss the roles played by these assumptions below. Later in the paper we present numerical calculations
10:379:32938:15:15:71:492:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that illustrate that these assumptions can be satisÖed by empirically plausible parameter values.

10:388:33543:22:21:71:352:303:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:C:2.1.1  Demand for the treatment under basic insurance
10:389:33596:21:15:71:539:282:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We begin by characterizing both consumer choice for the basic health insurance plan and consumer demand
10:390:33699:15:25:71:149:267:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the treatment.
10:391:33717:25:15:71:538:242:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f10:C:Proposition 1All consumers purchase basic health insurance. Only consumers for whomcWi--CC-P
10:392:33809:15:15:71:539:227:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:purchase the treatment if they become ill. Thus, when health insurance does not cover the treatment, the
10:393:33913:15:25:71:416:212:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:demand for the treatment is fully determined by consumer liquidity constraints.
10:394:33992:25:15:86:540:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The result that all consumers purchase basic health insurance isnot just becauseof Nymanís access
10:395:34089:15:15:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:motive. For consumers whose wealth is in the interval[P; P+-CC)not purchasing basic insurance would
10:396:34188:15:15:71:539:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:free up wealth that breaks the liquidity constraint in the event that the consumer becomes ill. That is, the
10:397:34296:15:15:71:539:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:possibility of the serious illness creates the potential for a ìreverse Nyman e§ectîwherein a consumer may
10:398:34402:15:14:71:539:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:want to save money that would have been spent on basic insurance to free up resources to treat the serious
10:399:34508:14:15:71:476:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:illness should it arise. Thus, it is conceivable not all consumers would opt for basic coverage.
10:400:34604:15:12:82:539:98:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:16Here and elsewhere, we implicitly ingnore the wealthiest tail of the wealth distribution. This would be problematic for us
10:401:34728:12:10:72:540:86:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:if the innovator priced the treatment so that only the wealthy could a§ord insurance to cover it. However, this does not appear
10:402:34855:10:7:72:511:76:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:to be case in practice since it would entail prices of innovative treatments well above even the current very high levels.
10:403:34977:7:12:82:539:69:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:17And indeed, as we show below, all consumers will, in fact, opt to choose basic health insurance to gain access to services
10:404:35101:12:0:72:209:57:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:that otherwise would be una§odable.
11:405:35137:0:15:86:539:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:However, in our model Assumption 4 ensures that this ìreverse Nyman e§ectî does not arise. Thus,
11:406:35233:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Proposition 1 arises in part because of Nymanís access motive but also in part because core medical services
11:407:35341:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are su¢ ciently valuable that no consumer Önds it worthwhile to skimp on basic insurance in order to free
11:408:35446:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:up wealth to a§ord the treatment in the event that it is needed. Given the variety of valuable products
11:409:35549:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and services that are included in the package of basic medical services, we believe that this is as reasonable
11:410:35659:15:15:72:124:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assumption.

13:495:39422:15:15:72:161:381:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:B:insured consumers.20
13:496:39442:15:15:86:539:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In the Appendix we derive the demand curve for the treatment. One component of treatment demand,
13:497:39538:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which we labelDu(P), captures the demand from individuals who cannot a§ord insurance but could a§ord
13:498:39638:15:15:72:539:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment, i.e.,P--CC < Wi< -IP. In the Appendix we show that ifW--C-I1--IC, there can be no
13:499:39734:15:15:72:539:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:uninsured buyers of the treatment at any price, i.e.,Du(P) = 0for allP. In other words, demand for the
13:500:39836:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment and demand for expanded insurance are one in the same. Given that-C-I1--I<1, this is a weak
13:501:39937:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:condition and, indeed as-I!0it reduces to our earlier assumption thatW-0. For now we assume that
13:502:40033:15:15:72:337:276:10:g_d0_f10:7:g_d0_f3:C:W--C-I1--ICand we ignore this component in what follows.21
13:503:40091:15:15:86:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The main component of treatment demand, which we labelD-(P), is the demand for the treatment that
13:504:40188:15:14:71:539:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:comes from consumers who purchase expanded insurance. This component is made up of two parts which
13:505:40286:14:15:71:539:232:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are depicted in Figure 4.  The Örst part, labeledD-Lin panel A of Figure 4, represents the demand for
13:506:40387:15:15:71:539:217:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance if the treatment had inÖnite value, so that the only factor limiting insurance demand is liquidity.
13:507:40496:15:15:71:539:202:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We call this theliquidity constraint schedule. Along this schedule, consumers purchase insurance (and thus
13:508:40602:15:26:71:455:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment) only ifP <Wi-I, and thusD-Lhas the equation (in inverse demand form)

13:512:40801:16:9:82:536:109:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:19Of courseó and this a key point of our analysisó liquidity constraints may a§ect the feasibility of either of these choices.
13:513:40927:9:13:82:540:100:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:20This economic equivalence between pre-paying-Pfor the treatment and payingPout-of-pocket for it only in the state of
13:514:41045:13:9:72:540:87:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the world when it is needed implies that in our welfare analysis below we can compute the consumer surplus from purchasing
13:515:41167:9:7:72:380:78:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the treatment exactly as we did when the treatment is not covered, i.e., using (10).
13:516:41251:7:7:82:338:71:6:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f15:F:21In the Online Appendix, we discuss what happens whenW<-C-I1--
13:517:41314:7:7:337:539:64:5:g_d0_f20:8:g_d0_f3:F:ICand thusDu(P)>0for someP. Using numerical
13:518:41357:7:0:72:443:57:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:analysis, we Önd that for these parameterizations, the main results reported below continue to hold.

14:520:41563:12:42:72:431:451:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:A, is the liquidity constraint. The second part, in panel B, is the value constraint.
14:521:41648:42:15:72:540:409:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity constraint, so that the only limiting factor is the value of the bundle covered by insurance. We call
14:522:41759:15:15:72:539:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this thevalue constraint schedule. This schedule traces out consumersíinclusive valuations of the insurance

16:605:46353:30:15:72:540:542:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In the Appendix we establish that, given Assumptions 1, 4, and 5, the solution to this problemó denoted by

16:608:46660:15:15:72:540:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment, the innovatorís proÖt-maximization solution implies that all consumers purchase insurance and
16:609:46764:15:15:72:395:482:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thus all consumers obtain core medical services when needed, i.e.,Y-= 1.
16:610:46836:15:15:86:539:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Why, given our parameter assumptions, does the innovator price the treatment so as to serve the entire
16:611:46938:15:14:71:539:452:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:market? To answer this question, letís contrast the innovatorís problem under expanded insurance to that
16:612:47042:14:15:71:539:438:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:under basic insurance. When the treatment is covered, its demand curveP-(Q)lies everywhere to the right
16:613:47145:15:15:71:540:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the demand curveP0(Q)when the treatment is not covered. (Formally, this is implied by Assumption 1).
16:614:47248:15:15:71:540:408:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:That, coupled with- <1(via Assumption 5), ensures thatP-(Q)is more price elastic thanP0(Q)for any
16:615:47345:15:15:71:539:393:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f3:B:Q2[0;1]. Thus, in general, coverage of the treatment must result in a higher proÖt-maximizing quantity
16:616:47447:15:15:71:539:378:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the treatment than if it is not covered. Whenever the proÖt-maximizing solution in the latter case is
16:617:47551:15:15:71:539:363:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to serve the entire market, the same will necessarily be true when the treatment is covered. Beyond this,
16:618:47656:15:15:71:539:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:though, Assumption 4ó which played a critical role in driving the result of full insurance coverage under
16:619:47761:15:15:71:539:333:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:basic insurance (i.e., Proposition 1)ó ensures that the inclusive value of the insurance bundle for a consumer
16:620:47871:15:15:71:539:318:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with even the lowest level of wealth is fairly ìlarge.îThe upshot is that the coverage of the treatment shifts
16:621:47981:15:15:71:539:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:its demand curve su¢ ciently rightward that it makes sense for the innovator to serve the entire market even
16:622:48089:15:15:71:425:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in circumstances in which it would not have had the treatment not been covered.
16:623:48168:15:15:86:539:273:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:BecauseV0equals the value of the treatment for the lowest wealth individualplus-C(B-C)-I, the innovator
16:624:48271:15:15:72:540:258:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:captures the (appropriately reweighted) expected social value of the core medical services. The comparative
16:625:48378:15:15:72:540:243:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:statics implication of this is that the treatmentís price under expanded insurance is higher the rarer the
16:626:48484:15:15:72:540:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:illness for which the treatment is needed and the more valuable are the core medical services covered by the
16:627:48592:15:15:72:540:213:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance plan. But an even more fundamental implication is that the innovatorís proÖt-maximizing price
16:628:48695:15:15:72:540:198:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reáects the inclusive value of the insurance bundle, not just the stand-alone value of the treatment. Indeed,
16:629:48804:15:14:72:540:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we can show that, despite pricing to serve the entire market, the innovatorís optimal price is strictly greater
16:630:48915:14:25:72:269:169:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:than the treatmentís value forallconsumers.

17:673:51904:15:15:86:539:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 summarizes the outcomes under basic and expanded insurance for this example. Coverage of

17:675:52103:14:15:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:large decrease in consumer surplus. The reduction in consumer surplus is more than o§set by an increase

17:680:52579:7:12:82:539:90:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:28Capping the income data in this way implicity rules out a situation where an innovator sets an implausibly high price that
17:681:52703:12:7:72:528:78:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:would put insurance beyond the means of all but a few consumers in the top several percentiles of the income distribution.

19:757:57387:25:15:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Health insurance typically covers a host of services, including many innovative pharmaceutical products. In
19:758:57494:15:15:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this section, we consider the implications of multiple innovators, and we show that our analysis assuming
19:759:57599:15:0:72:540:69:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a single innovator puts alower boundon the increase in price and decrease in consumer surplus due to
20:760:57701:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expansion of insurance coverage. We also show, in contrast to the single-innovator case, expanded insurance
20:761:57808:15:15:72:482:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covering multiple innovative treatments can result in lower total surplus than basic insurance.
20:762:57903:15:15:86:539:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:SpeciÖcally, suppose that there areNdistinct states in which a consumer can experience a di§erent serious
20:763:58008:15:15:71:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:illness, with each state having a probability-IN. For each of these possible illnesses, there is a treatment that
20:764:58121:15:15:72:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:provides an (identical) valueVito consumerishould that state occur (and no value should any other state
20:765:58224:15:15:72:539:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:occur). Given this speciÖcation, the case ofN= 1reduces to the model above. The assumption that the
20:766:58323:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment provides consumerithe same value in each state is not terribly restrictive if we imagine that each
20:767:58431:15:15:72:539:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f10:B:of theNpossible illnesses would, if not treated, result in death. In this case,Viis the value to consumeri
20:768:58537:15:15:72:193:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of prolonging his or her life.
20:769:58567:15:15:86:539:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Suppose the basic insurance plan covers none of theNtreatments. In that case, the consumer liquidity
20:770:58667:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:constraint determines the demand for each treatment in the state in which a treatment is needed.  The
20:771:58768:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:demand curve for each of theNtreatments is thus identical to the demand curve for the single-innovator
20:772:58870:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:case studied in the previous section, and as a result, under the basic insurance plan, each treatmentís

20:786:59559:15:15:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:continue to focus on the case in which (11) holds, and thus the demand curve for each individual treatment

20:810:60956:14:12:82:539:105:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:30As just noted, this proposition pertains to the case in which the demand curve for the treatment coincides with the value
20:811:61079:12:10:72:540:93:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:constraint. In the Online Appendix, we show that this result extends more generally: it holds when the demand curve for the
20:812:61202:10:9:72:540:83:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:treatment is the liquidity constraint, and it holds when the equilibrium with a single innovator occurs at the kink in the demand
20:813:61331:9:0:72:94:74:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:curve.
21:814:61339:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:i.e., not all consumers purchase expanded insurance and receive the treatments when needed. (Recall that in
21:815:61446:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the scenario under considerationó no uninsured purchases of treatmentsó the demand for expanded insurance
21:816:61551:15:15:72:539:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and the demand for the treatments are one in the same.) AsNincreases aboveN-, the price of each treatment
21:817:61656:15:15:72:539:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rises and the quantity of each treatment goes down. In the limit, asN! 1, each innovator sets a price
21:818:61757:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that approaches the inclusive value of the entire insurance bundle, but since the quantity of the treatments
21:819:61865:15:15:72:445:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:goes to zero in this case, innovators end up realizing just a tiny fraction of this value.
21:820:61955:15:15:86:539:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The insurance bundle in this case has essentially given rise to Cournotís complementary monopoly prob-
21:821:62057:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lem (Cournot 1927, Chapter IX). Though the model just sketched is special, the intuition is broader. Each
21:822:62162:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:innovator, when considering raising the price of its treatment, raises the price of (actuarially fair) insurance
21:823:62274:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by just a fraction of the increment to the treatment price, but it decreases the demand not just for its own
21:824:62382:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:treatment for all other services that the insurance bundle comprises. Thus, each innovator perceives itself
21:825:62489:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:facing signiÖcant ìpricing room,î and the bigger the insurance bundle the more ìroomî it perceives. By
21:826:62591:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:raising price, each innovator imposes a negative pecuniary externality on all other innovators. As a result,
21:827:62699:15:15:72:382:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:each ends up setting a higher price than a single innovator would have.
21:828:62770:15:15:86:539:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Because the multiple innovator case entails at least as high a price as in the single-innovator case, it
21:829:62874:15:15:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is straightforward to show that consumer surplus in the multiple-innovator case is no greater than (and
21:830:62977:15:15:72:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sometimes lower) than it is in the single-innovator case.31Consequently, in light of Proposition 4, expanded
21:831:63085:15:24:72:466:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance coveringNtreatments results in a lower consumer surplus than basic insurance.
21:832:63172:24:15:72:539:431:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Proposition 6Suppose (11) holds so that inclusion of the treatment in the health insurance plan breaks
21:833:63274:15:15:72:539:416:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:consumersíliquidity constraints. ThenCS-N< CS0, i.e., consumer surplus under expanded insurance that
21:834:63374:15:24:72:417:401:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:covers multiple treatments is less than consumer surplus under basic insurance.
21:835:63453:24:15:86:539:377:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Propositions 5 and 6 imply that our main results in the single-innovator caseó higher price and lower

21:837:63654:15:15:72:540:347:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we adapt of our model to the case of multiple innovators. It seems fair to say that our analysis with a single
21:838:63764:15:14:72:540:332:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:innovator provides a best-case scenario for the impact of expanding insurance. In addition, these results
21:839:63869:14:15:72:540:318:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that as the concentration of Örms in the innovative portion of the pharmaceutical market changes
21:840:63973:15:15:72:540:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:this should directly a§ect the prices charged for these products, with a lower concentration resulting in higher
21:841:64085:15:15:72:100:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices.
21:842:64092:15:15:86:539:273:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There is, however, one important di§erence between the multiple-innovator case and the single-innovator
21:843:64195:15:15:72:540:258:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:case. In the single-innovator case, the innovator priced the product so that the entire market was served,
21:844:64301:15:15:72:540:243:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and as a result, it generated at least as much social surplus as was generated under basic insurance. This
21:845:64407:15:24:72:341:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:does not necessarily hold when there are multiple treatments.
21:846:64468:24:15:72:539:204:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:C:Proposition 7Suppose (11) holds so that inclusion of the treatment in the health insurance plan breaks
21:847:64570:15:15:72:540:189:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:consumersíliquidity constraints. There existsbN >1, such that ifN >bN,T S-N< T S0, i.e., when the number
21:848:64674:15:15:72:540:174:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:of treatments is su¢ ciently large, total surplus under expanded insurance that covers multiple treatments is
21:849:64783:15:24:72:268:159:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:less than total surplus under basic insurance.
21:850:64829:24:15:86:540:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:In the single-innovator case, whenQ0<1under basic insurance, expanded insurance increases total
21:851:64924:15:15:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:surplus by enlarging the set of consumers who have access to the treatment.  It is true that consumers
21:852:65026:15:15:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pay a high price, but this is just a transfer between consumers and producers. However, the complementary
21:853:65131:15:15:72:540:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:monopoly problem that arises with multiple innovators works against increasing access: each innovator raises
21:854:65239:15:15:72:540:75:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the price of its treatment by so much that (forNlarge enough) some individuals decide to forego expanded
21:855:65343:15:0:82:312:60:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:31This is formally demonstrated in the proof of Proposition 6.
22:856:65407:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance coverage altogether. This results in fewer consumers receiving the treatments than would be the
22:857:65512:15:38:72:422:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:case when the treatments are not covered, which in turn decreases total surplus.
22:858:65592:38:22:72:540:657:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:4  Do the consumption smoothing beneÖts of insurance outweigh
22:859:65653:22:25:96:502:635:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:the drop in consumer surplus under expanded insurance?
22:860:65707:25:15:72:540:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:We have shown that consumer surplus under expanded insurance is less than consumer surplus under basic
22:861:65809:15:15:72:540:595:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance. But so far we have neglected the consumption smoothing beneÖts of insurance. Perhaps the ability
22:862:65916:15:15:72:540:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to better smooth consumption o§sets the higher price that consumers e§ectively pay for the treatment under

22:864:66041:15:15:86:539:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To explore this issue, we return to the single-innovator model and consider a simple speciÖcation in

22:898:67059:15:15:86:539:290:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Using the numerical example in Table 1 as an illustrative example, the consumption smoothing beneÖt

22:900:67259:15:15:72:540:260:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:implies that coe¢ cient of risk aversion would need to be about436for the consumption-smoothing beneÖts
22:901:67362:15:15:72:540:245:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of expanded insurance to outweigh the reduction in consumer surplus, well outside the range of empirical
22:902:67466:15:15:72:246:230:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of coe¢ cients of risk aversion.
22:903:67508:15:15:86:539:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Though the example is speciÖc, the intuition is robust. The reduction in consumer surplus under expanded
22:904:67612:15:15:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance tends to be greatest when the probability-Iof the serious illness is smallest, for it is under these
22:905:67722:15:15:72:540:185:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:conditions that the innovator enjoys the greatest degree of pricing power. But extending insurance to a rare
22:906:67830:15:14:72:540:170:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:event smooths consumption only a little. This can seen explicitly in the calculations above, but the insight
22:907:67938:14:15:72:318:156:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f3:B:would hold for a more general concave utility function.33
22:908:67995:15:13:82:539:141:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:32Recall in our model the implication of not having insurance in our model is thelossof a beneÖtBin state 1 andViin
22:909:68110:13:9:72:540:128:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:state 2. These can be thought of as avoided losses of income, and they are already counted as part of our consumer surplus
22:910:68232:9:7:72:114:119:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:calculation.
22:911:68244:7:12:82:539:112:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:33A more complete analysis would take into account that the risk aversion of consumers would alter the proÖt-maximizing
22:912:68363:12:9:72:540:100:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:price of insurance. But including that e§ect in our analysis would almost certainly strengthen the claim because risk aversion
22:913:68489:9:10:72:539:91:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:would strengthen the demand for expanded insurance, thus tending to increaseP-without changingP0, which would still be
22:914:68607:10:0:72:206:81:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:determined by liquidity constraints..
23:915:68646:0:25:72:450:710:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:5  Minimum coverage standards for health insurance
23:916:68696:25:15:72:540:685:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In the preceding analysis, we showed that coverage of the innovative treatment increases price and reduces
23:917:68802:15:15:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consumer surplus relative to the case in which the treatment is not covered. We can think of this analysis
23:918:68908:15:15:72:540:655:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as pertaining to a setting in which a treatment has recently been discovered. Our analysis sheds light on
23:919:69013:15:15:72:540:640:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whether the inclusion of a newly discovered treatment in health insurance formularies makes consumers
23:920:69114:15:15:72:457:625:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:better o§ when the innovator can exercise market power in the pricing of the treatment.
23:921:69201:15:15:86:539:610:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:But we can use our model to study an additional issue. Suppose that coverage of the treatment arises
23:922:69301:15:15:72:540:595:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:because insurers are mandated to do so through a minimum coverage standard (MCS). To study the impact
23:923:69402:15:15:72:540:580:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of these standards on consumers, the appropriate benchmark is not the case in which the treatment is not
23:924:69506:15:15:72:540:565:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covered by insurance. Rather, it is a setting in which consumers have the choice between a basic insurance
23:925:69612:15:15:72:540:550:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:plan that does not cover the treatment or an expanded plan that does. A minimum coverage standard that
23:926:69714:15:15:72:540:535:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:requires coverage of the treatment would rule out the choice of the basic plan, which means that insurance
23:927:69820:15:15:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bundles together the treatment and core medical services. By contrast, in the absence of a minimum standard,
23:928:69928:15:15:72:314:505:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment and core medical services are unbundled.
23:929:69982:15:14:86:539:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Having already studied pricing of the treatment under expanded insurance, we now consider pricing of
23:930:70082:14:15:72:540:476:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment when consumers can choose between the basic health insurance plan, the expanded health
23:931:70182:15:15:72:539:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance plan, or no insurance at all. Throughout we assume that the innovator sets a uniform pricePó i.e.,
23:932:70290:15:15:72:540:446:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:it does not discriminate between the price it charges a basic plan or an expanded plan, and the innovator is
23:933:70398:15:15:72:540:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assumed to set that price before consumers make their plan choice. We also focus on the single-innovator
23:934:70502:15:15:72:229:416:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:case and maintain Assumptions 1-5.
23:935:70536:15:15:86:539:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Recall that in Proposition 1, we showed that when faced with a choice between the basic health insurance
23:936:70640:15:15:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:plan and no insurance, all consumer choose the basic health insurance plan. Thus, the choice between the
23:937:70744:15:15:72:540:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:basic health insurance plan, the expanded health insurance plan, or no insurance boils down to a choice
23:938:70847:15:15:72:540:356:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between the Örst two. For any given pricePof the treatment, a consumer will choose the expanded plan if

23:955:71620:15:12:82:539:85:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:34For simplicity, we assume that if a consumer is indi§erent between the two options, it chooses expanded insurance. This
23:956:71741:12:10:72:540:73:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:is actually without loss of generality. The demand for the treatment ends up being the same if indi§erent consumers purchase

24:977:72842:30:15:72:540:478:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The treatment demand curve has the same form as it does when the consumers only had the choice between
24:978:72944:15:15:72:540:463:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expanded insurance and no insurance, except that the ìpieceîcorresponding to the value constraint contains

24:980:73158:15:15:72:540:433:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ance bundle. This makes sense: when we unbundle insurance, the demand for the treatment is e§ectively
24:981:73259:15:15:72:336:418:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:determined at the margin, i.e., by its own incremental value.
24:982:73320:15:15:86:539:403:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The analysis of treatment pricing when minimum coverage standards are absent is identical to our earlier

24:985:73632:15:24:72:278:358:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity constrained. This enables us to prove:

24:990:74078:15:15:71:539:274:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:maximizing price occurs along the value constraint. That is, a MCS mandating that the treatment be covered
24:991:74184:15:25:71:345:259:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:C:cannot decrease the price of the treatment and may increase it.
24:992:74247:25:15:86:539:234:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Because consumer choice is more limited under MCS and because the price of the treatment cannot go
24:993:74345:15:15:71:539:219:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:down (and may go up), an immediate implication is that these features of an MCS reduces consumer welfare.
24:994:74450:15:15:71:539:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:That being said, attempting to sell unbundled insurance products that each cover particular conditions or
24:995:74555:15:15:71:539:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sets of conditions may lead to a series of adversely selected risk pools.  Therefore, when considering the
24:996:74661:15:15:71:539:174:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:welfare e§ects of an MCS we must weigh the potential e¢ ciency losses from this adverse selection against
24:997:74766:15:15:71:539:159:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the lost consumer welfare and higher treatment prices that exist in the bundled market. To our knowledge,
24:998:74871:15:14:71:521:144:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our paper is the Örst highlight a mechanism for consumer surplus losses from these coverage standards.
24:999:74973:14:19:82:263:130:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:35The proof is as follows. If(Wi;Vi)is such that

24:1001:75043:15:10:72:540:96:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:then it follows thatVi-P-0. Conversely, ifVi-P-0, then there are one of two possibilities: eitherWi-PorWi<P. If
24:1002:75154:10:0:72:377:86:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the latter holds then for that set of consumers we havefWi<PandVi-P-0g.

25:1004:75290:23:25:96:216:687:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:Medicare Part D
25:1005:75305:25:15:72:540:662:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Two important predictions of our model are that the existence of health insurance increases the proÖt-
25:1006:75407:15:15:72:540:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing price and that the bundling of products into a single insurance bundle allows the monopoly
25:1007:75508:15:15:72:540:632:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:producer of an innovative product to capture more value than its product creates.  Due to the widespread
25:1008:75612:15:14:72:540:617:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:adoption of health insurance, empirically documenting these e§ects is di¢ cult. We attempt to overcome
25:1009:75714:14:15:72:540:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these di¢ culties by focusing on the creation of Medicare Part D, which was the Örst widespread social
25:1010:75816:15:15:72:540:588:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pharmaceutical insurance program for the elderly in the United States.  Prior to this program, the only
25:1011:75919:15:15:72:540:573:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:social insurance for pharmaceuticals for seniors covered products administered in a medical setting such as a
25:1012:76028:15:15:72:540:558:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:physicianís o¢ ce or outpatient facility. These drugs were covered under Medicare Part B and included many
25:1013:76134:15:15:72:166:543:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:intravenous products.
25:1014:76155:15:15:86:539:528:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:To examine the implications of our model, we estimate the e§ect of Medicare Part D on the launch prices
25:1015:76258:15:15:72:540:513:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of oncology productsó a category that has seen a relatively large number of innovative products released in
25:1016:76365:15:15:72:540:498:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the years before and after the creation of Part D. In addition, oncology is a category that contains many
25:1017:76470:15:15:72:540:483:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:intravenous products covered by Part B prior to the creation of Part D. The enabling legislation for the
25:1018:76574:15:15:72:540:468:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:creation of Medicare Part D was passed in late 2003 and seniors were Örst able to sign up for coverage as
25:1019:76679:15:15:72:540:453:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of 2006. Unlike the traditional Medicare program, coverage under Part D was provided by private insurers
25:1020:76783:15:15:72:540:438:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whose expenses were subsidized. Given that private insurers can make determinations about which drugs will
25:1021:76889:15:15:72:540:423:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be included on their formularies, the program contains a number of regulations regarding what drugs and drug
25:1022:76997:15:15:72:540:408:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:classes must be covered by a plan. For example, Part D plans must provide coverage for all diseases for which
25:1023:77106:15:15:72:540:393:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there are existing treatments. In addition, for each drug class, an insurer must provide at least two options
25:1024:77215:15:15:72:540:378:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that are chemically distinct (unless there is only one existing option a class). For six particular protected
25:1025:77324:15:15:72:540:363:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:classes (immunosuppressant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, antiretroviral, and antineoplastic
25:1026:77433:15:14:72:540:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products) the insurer must cover ìall or substantially allîdrugs in the class. In addition, they may not use
25:1027:77541:14:15:72:540:334:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:any step therapy or prior authorization measures for patients that are already taking the drug with the
25:1028:77644:15:15:72:540:319:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:burden of proof being on the insurer to show a patient was not previously taking the drug (Center for
25:1029:77745:15:15:72:540:304:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2014). Finally, products that were covered under Part B were intended to
25:1030:77849:15:15:72:355:289:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be broadly una§ected by the new coverage o§ered under Part D.
25:1031:77910:15:15:86:539:274:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Several features of Part D provide an opportunity for empirically examining the implications of our model
25:1032:78015:15:15:72:540:259:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with respect to oncology (i.e. antineoplastic) products. First, the expansion increased the share of elderly
25:1033:78123:15:15:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Americans with drug coverage by 10 percentage points (Engelhart and Gruber, 2010).  For these newly
25:1034:78222:15:15:72:540:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insured individuals, Part D broke the liquidity constraint for expensive drugs such as oncology products.
25:1035:78327:15:15:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the creation of protected classes guaranteed that all new oncology products would be included in a
25:1036:78433:15:15:72:540:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bundle with products that are sold in more competitive markets. This is explicitly true for enrollees in Part
25:1037:78542:15:15:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:D, but these new regulations also likely ináuenced coverage decisions in the private market where insurers
25:1038:78648:15:15:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:often follow Medicareís policies because of a variety of factors such as litigation risk (Bagley, Chandra, and
25:1039:78758:15:15:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Frakt, 2015).36This forced bundle allows us to examine the prediction that a Örm producing an innovative
25:1040:78862:15:15:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:product that is bundled with more competitively priced products can capture more than the valued created
25:1041:78966:15:15:72:137:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by its product.
25:1042:78981:15:15:86:539:109:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Duggan and Scott Morton (2010) examined the e§ect of Medicare Part D on all drug prices and found that
25:1043:79083:15:14:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the newly insured paid lower prices for all medications. The mechanism underlying this result is that private
25:1044:79192:14:13:82:539:80:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:36For example, in May 2015 Anthem Blue Cross-Blue Shield was sued for denying a claim for an expensive hepatitis-
25:1045:79305:13:9:72:540:67:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:C treatment that it deemed was not medically necessary given the sickness of the patient (Pfei§er, 2015).  Similarly, state
25:1046:79428:9:0:72:526:58:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:Medicaid system in several states face legal liability for their e§orts to limit access to the same treatment (Kardish, 2014).
26:1047:79556:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurers could negotiate price discounts that the uninsured were unable to previously obtain. However, this
26:1048:79663:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price e§ect was quite heterogeneous and, consistent with the predictions of our model, in situations where
26:1049:79769:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurers were either required (because of the protected class regulations) or e§ectively required (because of
26:1050:79878:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a small number of products in the class) to cover all products, the passage of Part D was estimated to either
26:1051:79987:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase or have no e§ect on the average prices paid by newly insured consumers.  We focus our analysis on
26:1052:80093:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the launch prices charged in one of these protected classes and implement a di§erent identiÖcation strategy
26:1053:80200:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that exploits the fact that many oncology products previously had insurance coverage under Medicareís Part
26:1054:80306:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:B medical beneÖt. In contrast to previous work we also consider the survival-adjusted price of products
26:1055:80409:15:15:72:400:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which serves as an indicator of the amount of value captured by producers.
26:1056:80483:15:15:86:539:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Given our interest in how the presence and structure of insurance programs impacts the prices charged by
26:1057:80587:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:innovators (i.e. those products for which there are limited opportunities for consumer or insurer substitution)
26:1058:80698:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we focus our attention on oncology products that were required to be covered under Part D. In accordance
26:1059:80802:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with our model, we expect that the passage of Part D should have two e§ects on this market. First, there
26:1060:80906:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:should be an increase in prices for products, such as oncology, that are used by individuals that are covered
26:1061:81015:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by Part D. Second, because of the forced bundling and protected class status the producers of oncology
26:1062:81117:15:15:72:483:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products should be better able to sell their products for more than the value that they create.
26:1063:81212:15:15:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We begin by noting that prices have been rising in oncology in general over the last two decades. For
26:1064:81313:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:example, Howardet al. (2015) documents that the ináation and survival-adjusted prices for newly released
26:1065:81417:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:oncology products increased by 10 percent per year from 1995 ñ2013. Using the same data from this study,
26:1066:81521:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we examine the relationship between the passage of Medicare Part D and rising survival-adjusted oncology
26:1067:81625:15:15:72:539:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices.37These data contain the launch prices for 58 oncology products that were approved for sale by
26:1068:81726:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the FDA between 1995 and 2013 that were initially approved for cancer treatment and were intended for
26:1069:81827:15:15:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a§ecting survival rather than alleviating symptoms. In addition, drugs are only included in these data if
26:1070:81932:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there are clear estimates of their survival beneÖt ñwhich is important for determining the value created by
26:1071:82039:15:15:72:542:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the product as well as a quality adjusted measure of prices. The launch price is ìepisode treatment priceî
26:1072:82145:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:which is the monthly price paid by Medicare multiplied by the typical treatment duration. More detail on
26:1073:82249:15:15:72:317:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these pricing data are available in Howardet al. (2015).
26:1074:82305:15:15:86:539:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 7 contains the resulting scatter plot and Ötted curve from a locally weighted regression of price
26:1075:82409:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on the year of FDA approval for the oncology products in our sample. This shows that the price increase
26:1076:82512:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:over the entire sample identiÖed in Howardet al. (2015) is composed of relatively áat and stable trend from
26:1077:82619:15:15:72:389:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:1995 ñ2003 and rapidly increasing price increases in the years following.
26:1078:82692:15:15:86:539:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This pattern is consistent with our modelís prediction that proÖt-maximizing prices are higher when a
26:1079:82793:15:15:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:greater share of potential customers have insurance. To further examine this relationship, we exploit the
26:1080:82898:15:15:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:fact that not all oncology products were covered by the passage of Part D. Unlike other pharmaceutical
26:1081:83000:15:15:72:540:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:categories, many oncology products are administered in a physicianís o¢ ce or hospital setting. As a result,
26:1082:83108:15:14:72:540:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:these products are covered (and have always been covered) under Medicare Part B.38Figure 8 contains the
26:1083:83211:14:15:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:average launch price per year for oncology products based on whether they were covered by either Medicare
26:1084:83316:15:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Part B or Part D. The solid line represents the log of the average price for products that were covered (or
26:1085:83423:15:15:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:eventually covered) by Part D. Between 1995 and the passage of Part D in 2003, there were 8 oncology
26:1086:83523:15:15:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products that were generally not covered under Part B but would eventually be covered under Part D.
26:1087:83622:15:10:82:369:112:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:37We are grateful to Rena Conti for granting us permission to use these data.
26:1088:83699:10:12:82:539:102:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:38Previous work has used the share spending for the disease category that is eligible for Medicare coverage.  For most drugs,
26:1089:83824:12:9:72:540:90:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:this is a good approximation of the e§ect of expanded Part D coverage. However, a disproportionately large fraction of oncology
26:1090:83951:9:10:72:540:81:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:products are eligible for coverage under Part B. One strategy would be to estimate a triple di§erence model that exploits both
26:1091:84077:10:9:72:540:71:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:the share of patients over 65 and the Part B coverage status.  Given that that there are only 58 oncology products released
26:1092:84200:9:0:72:467:62:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:over the 18 year period in our sample, splitting the data along both of these dimensions is too demanding.
27:1093:84308:0:42:187:423:462:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 7: Prices of new oncology products, 1995-2015.
27:1094:84361:42:15:71:539:420:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Overall, the prices for these products were far below the average prices of drugs of the 12 products released
27:1095:84470:15:15:71:539:405:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:over this time that were covered by Part Bó represented by the dashed line. In addition, prior to the passage
27:1096:84579:15:15:71:539:390:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of Part D the trend in prices is generally áat and similar across the two groups of drugs. The only exception

27:1098:84794:15:15:71:539:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there is an immediate sudden increase in the average launch price of Part D oncology products. As a result,
27:1099:84901:15:15:71:461:345:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:after the 2006 implementation of Part D the two sets of products had very similar prices.
27:1100:84990:15:15:86:539:330:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There could be a concern that the higher prices for products that were released after the passage of Part

27:1102:85198:15:15:71:539:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the higher prices were a refection of this greater value. Figure 9 contains the average prices per life year
27:1103:85306:15:14:71:539:285:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gained by Part D coverage status and year. Prior to 2003, the Part D products had an average (median)
27:1104:85407:14:15:71:539:271:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price per life year gained of approximately $52,500 ($11,000).  In comparison, the intravenous oncology
27:1105:85510:15:15:71:539:256:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products covered by Part B that were released prior to 2004 had an average (median) life year gained of
27:1106:85613:15:15:71:539:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:$100,000 ($70,700). Following the passage of Part D there was a marked increase in the prices for both sets
27:1107:85720:15:15:71:539:226:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of products. However, this increase was far greater for products that were covered by Part D and resulting
27:1108:85826:15:15:71:539:211:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in near parity in their survival adjusted launch prices. After 2004 the average (median) price per life year
27:1109:85934:15:15:71:531:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:gained for Part D products was $176,000 ($153,000), and for Part B products it was $172,000 ($147,000).
27:1110:86037:15:15:86:539:181:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:These Ögures suggests two reactions to the passage of Medicare Part D. First, the manufacturers of oral
27:1111:86140:15:15:71:539:166:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:chemotherapy products increased their prices.  Second, these manufacturers were now able to command
27:1112:86239:15:15:71:539:151:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:prices that exceeded many estimates of the value that they create. To more systematically examine these

29:1142:87748:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates for the outcome of the log of the average price. Across all three speciÖcations, the passage
29:1143:87854:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of Part D is associated with a large increase in the average launch price of oncology products that were
29:1144:87958:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:covered by that program compared to drugs that were covered under Part B. For example, the coe¢ cient in
29:1145:88062:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:column (3) implies that the passage of Part D is associated with an approximately 420 percent increase in
29:1146:88167:15:15:72:311:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the average launch price of a§ected oncology products.
29:1147:88221:15:15:86:539:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The coe¢ cients in columns (4)-(6) of Table 3 estimate the change in price per life year gained in the years
29:1148:88329:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:following the passage of Part D. The estimate in column (4) without any product or market covariates is
29:1149:88432:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:roughly similar in magnitude to the estimate for the change in the log price in column (3). The coe¢ cient in
29:1150:88541:15:15:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:column (6) suggests that the passage of Part D was responsible for a 175 percent increase (p-value = 0.062)

29:1152:88755:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Part B. While the estimated changes in both the average price and average price per life year gained are
29:1153:88859:14:15:72:487:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:large, note that they are broadly in line with the estimate in our canonical example in Table 1.
29:1154:88955:15:15:86:539:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We next examine the question of whether the Passage of Part D allowed manufacturers to capture more
29:1155:89054:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:value than their products create. Conducting such an analysis requires deÖning the value created by these
29:1156:89159:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products. During the debate about the passage of Part D there was considerable discussion about the cost
29:1157:89263:15:15:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the program and many suggested that the government should implement a cost e§ectiveness measure.
29:1158:89362:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:At the time, a commonly discussed threshold was between $50,000 and $100,000 per quality adjusted life
29:1159:89464:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:year, with this number based on treatments that were currently being provided to dialysis patients (Millick,
29:1160:89572:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2004).  More recent work has estimated that dialysis treatment is valued at approximately $129,000 per
29:1161:89674:15:15:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quality adjusted life year and $62,000 per life year (Lee, Chertow, and Zenios, 2009). The estimates in Table
29:1162:89783:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:4 examine the change in the share of products that are above these two thresholds. The estimates related
29:1163:89887:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to the threshold of $50,000 per life year suggest a large increase in the share of products over this threshold
29:1164:89998:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for those products covered by Part D compared to oncology products covered under Part B. The estimated
29:1165:90100:15:15:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:e§ect ranges from an approximately 64 percent increase (p-value = 0.004) in the model with no covariates
29:1166:90204:15:15:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to an increase of approximately 43 percent (p-value = 0.128) in the model with both controls for product
29:1167:90308:15:15:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics and disease Öxed e§ects. The estimates related to the share of products over $100,000 are
29:1168:90413:15:15:72:414:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:large in magnitude but statistically insigniÖcant across all three speciÖcations.
29:1169:90494:15:15:86:539:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:While these estimated e§ects are for only one product class and change in coverage, they provide strong
29:1170:90597:15:14:72:540:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggestive evidence of the e§ects predicted by our model. Following the insurance expansion and the forced
29:1171:90703:14:15:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:bundle, the monopoly producers of oncology products were able to increase prices and capture far more value
29:1172:90810:15:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:than they could when facing a market with less insurance and more áexibility regarding the composition of
29:1173:90915:15:38:72:166:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the insurance bundle.
29:1174:90936:38:25:72:455:104:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:7  The Role of Insurance in Recent High Drug Prices
29:1175:90987:25:15:72:540:79:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:While our results regarding the prices of oncology products following the passage of Part D show a sharp
29:1176:91091:15:0:72:540:64:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase in those prices following 2003, a second clear pattern is the rising prices of all oncology products in
32:1177:93026:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:recent years. An open question is why has there been such a large increase in recent years for products covered
32:1178:93137:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by Part B. In addition, we note that these high prices have not been limited to oncology products. Over the
32:1179:93244:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:last decade there has been increased attention on the high prices charged for new pharmaceuticals, peaking
32:1180:93350:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with the release of Sovaldi, Gileadís cure for hepatitis C. Sovaldi was initially priced at approximately $84,000
32:1181:93463:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:per course of treatment and was part of a wave of new specialty pharmaceutical products that cost upwards
32:1182:93568:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and in excess of $100,000 per course of treatment. In addition to these highly priced new drugs, several small
32:1183:93678:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:companies have recently acquired generic drugs and dramatically increased their prices. Perhaps the most
32:1184:93782:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:highly discussed of these is Turing Pharmaceuticals, which bought the production facilities for Daraprim in
32:1185:93889:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:August, 2015 and immediately raised the price from $13.50 to $750 per pill (Pollack, 2015). This strategy
32:1186:93994:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of price increases following the acquisition of existing products has also been seen for other companies such
32:1187:94103:15:15:72:426:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Mallinckrodt Plc (Rocko§ and Silverman, 2015).
32:1188:94180:15:15:86:539:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:It is di¢ cult to Önd a simple explanation for these unprecedented prices and recent price increases.
32:1189:94281:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:For example, one might attribute price increases to Part D, but the price data on oncology products show
32:1190:94385:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:recent high prices for drugs covered by Part B. And while the A§ordable Care Act was passed in 2009 and
32:1191:94488:15:15:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:implemented fully in 2014, many of these high prices preceded this insurance expansion. Therefore, it seems
32:1192:94595:15:15:72:504:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unlikely that these insurance expansions, on their own, could explain the recent rise in drug prices.
32:1193:94696:15:15:86:539:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:During this same time period there have also been changes in market structure that, in combination with
32:1194:94799:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the changes in insurance programs, provide a possible explanation for these price increases. As recently as
32:1195:94906:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a decade ago, a large fraction of the highest grossing drug products in the United States was marketed by
32:1196:95011:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a relatively small number of large Örms. This has changed dramatically over the last decade. Today, many
32:1197:95115:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Örms, including several relative newcomers, sell just a handful of drugs. Figure 10 contains the HHI based
32:1198:95221:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:on worldwide sales for the top 200 pharmaceuticals in every Öve years from 1998-2013. From 1998 to 2003,
32:1199:95325:15:15:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the market concentration among these products remains markedly similar. However, over the next Öve years
32:1200:95429:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:there is a steep drop in the HHI which remains approximately the same through 2013. A similar pattern
32:1201:95530:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can be seen in Figure 11, which contains the percentage of worldwide sales in the top 200 for the average

32:1203:95698:15:15:86:539:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This shift has been driven both by expiring patents for high-selling drugs from large manufacturers and
32:1204:95801:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the introduction of new drugs by Örms with a far smaller portfolio of products. Consider that in 1998, PÖzer
32:1205:95909:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:had the 4th, 7th, and 8th highest grossing drugs while Merck had the 2nd and 5th. In that year Merck
32:1206:96009:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:accounted for 11.8 percent of top 200 sales, PÖzer accounted for 9.7 percent, and the average market share
32:1207:96115:15:15:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for a Örm with a top 10 grossing pharmaceutical was 6.7 percent. By 2013, each of these Örms had only one
32:1208:96220:15:15:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:top 10 drug and only Roche had more than one drug in the top 10. As a result, in 2013 the top 200 market
32:1209:96324:15:15:72:540:231:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:share of these Örms had fallen to less than 6 percent, Roche had the highest share of the top 200 that year
32:1210:96431:15:15:72:540:216:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:accounted at 6.2 percent, and the average market share of a Örm with a top 10 grossing drug was only 4.6
32:1211:96535:15:15:72:471:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:percent. As large Örms left the top 10, they were often replaced by far smaller competitors.
32:1212:96627:15:14:86:539:186:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:These data document the increased fragmentation of drug sales.  In addition, a shift in the research
32:1213:96727:14:15:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and development strategy of pharmaceutical Örms has increasingly meant that drugs under production at
32:1214:96828:15:15:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the largest pharmaceutical Örms began their life at smaller companies.  Rocko§ (2014) notes that from
32:1215:96929:15:15:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2002-2012, the percentage of drugs under development by the top 10 pharmaceutical Örms that began at
32:1216:97029:15:15:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:another company increased from 16 percent to 33 percent. Smaller companies that receive royalties from
32:1217:97131:15:15:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:their discoveries would be unlikely to worry about any negative externalities from high prices. This e§ectively
32:1218:97242:15:15:72:207:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:further fragments the industry.
32:1219:97273:15:15:86:539:82:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Our model of pharmaceutical pricing for an insured population suggests that the simultaneous occurrence
32:1220:97376:15:0:72:540:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of these two phenomenaó higher prices and smaller Örmsó is no mere coincidence. Nor is the timing of the

34:1227:98031:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price spikes, coming shortly after the implementation of Medicare Part D. Recall that our model identiÖes
34:1228:98136:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:two demand constraints on drug pricing.  First, drug makers must consider the value that is created by
34:1229:98238:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:their new drug. Second, they must consider the degree to which their price will make the bundled insurance
34:1230:98344:15:15:72:540:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:product too expensive for some customers. This second constraint suggests that high prices charged by one
34:1231:98449:15:15:72:540:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Örm can generate a negative externality on the sales of other drugs. This occurs through a decrease in the
34:1232:98555:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:potential market of insured customers who, in the absence of insurance, would be liquidity constrained with
34:1233:98662:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:respect to their purchases of high value drugs. As we note in Section 3, when multiple innovative products
34:1234:98768:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are sold by di§erent Örms, as is the case in the current market for speciality pharmaceuticals, prices will be
34:1235:98878:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:weakly higher and if there are enough products total surplus will decrease as consumers decline to purchase
34:1236:98985:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the insurance bundle.  This results from Örms failing to internalize the e§ect of their price on the demand
34:1237:99092:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the insurance bundle. As a result, drug makers acting in their own self-interest may set individual prices
34:1238:99202:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that exceed the prices that maximize industry proÖts. However, our model suggests that a market dominated
34:1239:99307:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by a few large Örms with extensive product portfolios should have internalized more of the e§ect of their
34:1240:99412:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pricing decision for new products on the a§ordability of the insurance bundle and/or perhaps even behaved
34:1241:99517:15:15:72:539:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in an implicitly collusive fashion to hold the line on large price increases (Ellison and Wolfram, 2006).39In
34:1242:99626:15:15:72:540:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, the increased fragmentation of the drug market should result in higher prices, even if we hold the
34:1243:99734:15:15:72:244:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:size of the insured population constant.
34:1244:99774:15:14:86:539:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Consistent with this model, note that Gilead, the marketer of Sovaldi, had only 3.6 percent of top 200
34:1245:99876:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sales in 2014 (compared to a mean for a top 10 grossing Örm of approximately 4.6 percent). Most of these
34:1246:99980:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:sales were for Sovaldi, and the Örm averaged approximately 1 percent of top 200 sales per year in preceding
34:1247:100087:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Öve years. Similarly, Turing Pharmaceuticals, the Örm that acquired and raised the price of Daraprim has
34:1248:100191:15:15:72:479:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:only been in existence for one year and has only two FDA approved products in its portfolio.
34:1249:100283:15:15:86:539:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The expansions in insurance coverage resulting from Medicare Part D and the ACA would only exacerbate
34:1250:100384:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the incentive for price increases resulting from a fragmented pharmaceutical market. This is both because
34:1251:100489:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the increase in the size of the insurance population and the increased bundling of drugs under a single
34:1252:100595:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance product further encourages higher pricing. For example, Medicare Part D requires coverage of all
34:1253:100701:15:15:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:new cancer drugs as well as drugs in several other classes. Private insurers often follow Medicareís lead, for
34:1254:100811:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reasons that are not clear. The combination of a fragmented market and bundled coverage may have created
34:1255:100915:15:15:72:540:291:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a perfect storm of incentives for sky high prices. While further empirical work would be required to establish
34:1256:101025:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:causality and magnitudes of these e§ects, they are quite suggestive of an unexplored channel to explain the
34:1257:101132:15:37:72:183:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:recent rise in drug prices.
34:1258:101159:37:25:72:180:224:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:8  Conclusions
34:1259:101173:25:15:72:540:199:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:While health insurance bears many similarities to more traditional Önancial insurance products, it also con-
34:1260:101281:15:15:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:veys the important beneÖt of breaking the liquidity constraint that many consumers face when attempting to
34:1261:101387:15:15:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:purchase costly but valuable medical goods and services, including high priced pharmaceutical treatments.
34:1262:101492:15:15:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Previous work has asserted that this increase in access represents a beneÖt for consumers. However, our
34:1263:101595:15:15:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:results, which endogenize the prices charged by the monopoly manufacturers of high value products, demon-
34:1264:101700:15:15:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:strate that consumers may actually enjoy less consumer surplus, even in the absence of moral hazard. This
34:1265:101805:15:15:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:occurs because insurance allows Örms to more fully price out the expected beneÖts that their drugs generate
34:1266:101912:15:14:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for consumers, charging prices that may be far higher than what they would select if patients had to pay the
34:1267:102020:14:13:82:539:80:6:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:39Note that this economic externality e§ect is distinct from, but has the same implications as, the oft heard claim that drug
34:1268:102145:13:0:72:341:67:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:makers keep prices low simply to avoid the prospects of price regulation.
35:1269:102220:0:15:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:entire price of their drugs out of pocket. This not only reduces consumer surplus, it may also reduce total
35:1270:102327:15:15:72:540:695:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:surplus if some consumers are liquidity constrained from purchasing insurance. Thus, regulations requiring
35:1271:102433:15:15:72:540:680:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurers to provide coverage for all new high-value products, such as the minimum insurance deÖnition of
35:1272:102537:15:15:72:425:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the ACA, can decrease consumer surplus and, potentially, decrease total surplus.
35:1273:102617:15:15:86:539:650:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We also explore the traditional bundling of pharmaceutical insurance with insurance for other medical
35:1274:102718:15:15:72:540:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:services, and Önd that bundling allows monopolist drug makers to charge prices that exceed the value created
35:1275:102826:15:15:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by their products. The manufacturers of innovative products must still price according to a downward sloping
35:1276:102934:15:15:72:540:605:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:demand curve; however, they make their pricing decision with the knowledge that they will be bundled with
35:1277:103039:15:15:72:540:590:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:products that provide a large amount of consumer surplus. Bundling allows the innovators to capture value
35:1278:103144:15:15:72:540:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that is created by more competitively priced products and services. This may explain why some the prices
35:1279:103248:15:15:72:540:560:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of some drugs seem to exceed their expected value without relying on consumer inattention, asymmetric
35:1280:103349:15:15:72:540:545:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:information, or moral hazard. While regulations establishing minimum quality standards for insurance and
35:1281:103453:15:15:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:stipulations about what pharmaceutical products must be included on a formulary can plausibly create
35:1282:103553:15:15:72:540:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consumer surplus gains, our results show that these must be weighed against losses that come from these
35:1283:103656:15:15:72:149:500:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pricing dynamics.
35:1284:103673:15:15:86:539:485:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:It is important to note that drug makers only beneÖt from the access motive while their drug is under
35:1285:103774:15:15:72:540:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:patent. While our model considers only this time period, it is clear that following the expiration of a patent
35:1286:103884:15:14:72:540:455:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the decrease in prices resulting from the entry of generic competitors would transfer surplus from producers
35:1287:103992:14:15:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to consumers. This reminds us that the vast majority of a drug makerís proÖts accrue in the period before
35:1288:104097:15:15:72:540:426:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:patent expiration. Any policy that would address the pricing dynamics that we discuss, such as policies to
35:1289:104203:15:15:72:540:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unbundle drug coverage, could therefore have a dramatic impact on proÖts, and this, in turn, might have
35:1290:104306:15:15:72:540:396:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unintended consequences for innovative activity. Previous research has shown that pharmaceutical research
35:1291:104411:15:15:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and development e§orts are correlated with expected proÖts (Acemoglu and Linn, 2004; Finkelstein, 2004;
35:1292:104514:15:15:72:540:366:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Blume-Kohut and Sood, 2012; Dranove, Garthwaite, and Hermasillo, 2014). To fully understand the welfare
35:1293:104617:15:15:72:540:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics of the access motive of insurance, future work should consider whether increased proÖts (and
35:1294:104718:15:15:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:lost consumer surplus) while the drug is manufactured by a monopoly producer provide the appropriate
35:1295:104818:15:15:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incentives for products that could have large welfare beneÖts after patent expiration. This would involve
35:1296:104923:15:15:72:540:306:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:understanding both the innovators response to proÖts and the longevity of the welfare beneÖts of new

35:1298:105130:15:15:72:540:276:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price controls in pharmaceuticals will be welfare reducing through reduced innovation, our results suggest that
35:1299:105241:15:15:72:540:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:some existing regulations may provide incentives for innovation that are themselves not welfare maximizing
35:1300:105347:15:37:72:296:246:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:because they are based on prices that exceed value.

37:1398:110208:12:21:86:270:92:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:There are three relevant cases to consider:

38:1444:113058:15:13:72:503:110:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f3:B:Proof that if individuals who can a§ord expanded insurance purchase it, thenVi-P--C-I(B-C):
38:1445:113149:13:7:86:540:97:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f4:A:Suppose, to the contrary, that individuals who can a§ord to insurance do purchase it, butVi< P-

38:1447:113246:8:10:74:540:82:7:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f3:B:-I(B-C). This impliesVi< P, which in turn impliescWi< P, sincecWi< Vi. Using (17) and (18) we then
38:1448:113344:10:12:71:91:72:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:have
38:1449:113348:12:0:204:407:60:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:C:EUIi-EUNIi=-C(B-C) +-I(Vi-P)<0;
39:1450:113381:0:14:72:540:710:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where the inequality follows from the contrapositive assumptionVi< P--C-I(B-C). But this contradicts
39:1451:113481:14:12:72:361:696:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:our premise that individuals who can a§ord insurance purchase it.
39:1452:113546:12:12:86:539:684:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Now consider consumers for whom expanded insurance is not a§ordable:cWi--CC+-IP, or equivalently,
39:1453:113643:12:13:72:540:672:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f3:B:Wi--IP. However, if the individual becomes ill, the individual might still purchase the treatment. The
39:1454:113745:13:12:72:539:659:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:individual would be able to a§ord to do so ifcWi> P(or equivalentlyWi> P--CC), and if that is the

39:1456:113917:12:12:86:470:635:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, summing up, the demand for the treatment comes from two groups of consumers:

39:1459:114182:12:12:72:148:598:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:when they fall ill;
39:1460:114201:12:13:86:539:586:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:(2) Consumers for whomcWi< -CC+-IP(or equivalently,Wi< -IP) cannot a§ord to purchase
39:1461:114285:13:12:72:540:573:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:insurance and will not do so.  However, a subset of these consumers for whomcWi-P, or equivalently
39:1462:114383:12:12:72:540:561:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f3:B:Wi> P--CC, can a§ord to purchase insurance if they fall ill, and they will do so sinceVi>cWi> P.
39:1463:114479:12:12:72:540:549:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:These are consumers who cannot a§ord to purchase insurance but would purchase the treatment if the price

42:1759:120245:12:12:86:540:336:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:First, consider the case in whichW-1, soQ0=Q-= 1. In this case, coverage of the treatment leaves
42:1760:120341:12:12:72:540:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the quantity of the treatment purchased unchanged. Moreover, it also does not reduce health insurance
42:1761:120442:12:12:72:540:312:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:coverage, so consumption of core medical services is unchanged. However, recall from Proposition 3 that the
42:1762:120549:12:12:72:540:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:price of the treatment is higher when it is covered by insurance. Note that the expression for the consumer

42:1765:120777:23:12:86:539:242:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Next, consider the case in whichW<1, soQ0=W+12< Q-= 1. Using (13) and (14), we can write the
