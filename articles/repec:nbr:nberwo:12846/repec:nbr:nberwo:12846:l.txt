2:32:1763:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:This paper develops a framework to understand the role of interpersonal interactions in the labor market
2:33:1867:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:including task assignment and wages. Effective interpersonal interactions involve caring, to establish
2:34:1969:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:cooperation, and at the same time directness, to communicate in an unambiguous way. The ability
2:35:2064:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:to perform these tasks varies with personality and the importance of these tasks varies across jobs.
2:36:2164:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:An assignment model shows that people are most productive in jobs that match their style and earn
2:37:2261:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:less when they have to shift to other jobs. An oversupply of one attribute relative to the other reduces
2:38:2365:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:wages for people who are better with the attribute in greater supply. We present evidence that youth
2:39:2465:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:sociability affects job assignment in adulthood. The returns to interpersonal interactions are consistent
2:40:2570:14:28:72:204:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:with the assignment model.

3:63:3012:0:26:92:166:714:127:Times:127:Times:?:I. Introduction 
3:64:3028:26:26:126:522:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:There is a growing consensus that noncognitive skills are important for understanding 
3:65:3114:26:26:92:526:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:individual  labor  market  outcomes.  From  the  psychological  literature  it  is  known  that  
3:66:3211:26:26:92:523:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:differences  in  personality  have  strong  effects  on  individual  behavior  (John  and  Srivastava,  
3:67:3315:26:25:92:522:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:1999). In the economic literature, simple correlations between personality traits and outcomes 
3:68:3410:25:26:92:522:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:suggest that noncognitive skills are important in predicting individual labor market outcomes, 
3:69:3505:26:26:92:522:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:such as behavior and labor market success (Bowles, Gintis and Osborne, 2001). However, the 
3:70:3596:26:26:92:523:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:estimated  relationship  between  psychological  traits  and  outcomes  varies  substantially  across  
3:71:3699:26:26:92:522:507:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:studies, and their effects are remarkably small. Understanding the role of noncognitive skills 
3:72:3794:26:26:92:525:481:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:for   individual   labor   market   outcomes   requires  an  understanding  of  different  types  of  
3:73:3896:26:26:92:522:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:personalities  from  psychology  as  well  as  an  understanding  of  behavior  and  assignment  from  
3:74:3999:26:26:92:202:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:the economic literature. 
3:75:4024:26:26:126:523:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Jobs  vary  in  the  types  of  interactions  that  are  important.  For  instance,  teachers  and  
3:76:4124:26:26:92:525:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:nurses need cooperation and have to be relatively caring in dealing with pupils and patients.  
3:77:4219:26:26:92:523:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:Salespeople  and  managers  have  to  be  more  direct  in  their  interactions.  Our  model  includes  
3:78:4323:26:26:92:523:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:both  styles.  In  our  model,  different  jobs  emphasize  different  styles.  While  people  can  adjust  
3:79:4431:26:26:92:522:299:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:their behavior to suit their jobs to some extent, the most caring people will be assigned to jobs 
3:80:4529:26:26:92:523:273:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:where  caring  is  relatively  important  and  relatively  direct  people  will  be  assigned  to  jobs  in  
3:81:4638:26:26:92:525:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:which  directness  is  important.  Supply  and  demand  determine  prices  and  allocations,  so  
3:82:4736:26:26:92:524:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:imbalances  in  supply  and  demand  induce  shifts  of  people  to  jobs  in  which  they  are  less  
3:83:4839:26:26:92:237:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:effective, which lowers wages.  
3:84:4871:26:26:126:523:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:We  study  four  of  our  model’s  implications  using  British  data  (covering  1997-2001)  
3:85:4965:26:26:92:524:143:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:and  German  data  (covering  1979-1998).  We  show  that  personality  at  age  16  is  a  good  
3:86:5063:26:26:92:523:117:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:predictor  of  later  job  assignment  in  the  sense  that  relatively  caring  (direct)  people  end  up  
3:87:5171:26:0:92:523:91:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:working  in  more  caring  (direct)  jobs.  Second,  estimates  from  our  assignment  model  reveal  
4:88:5274:0:26:92:523:714:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:that  the  relative  supply  and  demand  for  directness  –  measured  as  the  ratio  of  directness  to  
4:89:5382:26:26:92:522:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:caring – determines wages. Third, we show that changes over time in the relative importance 
4:90:5474:26:26:92:524:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:of  the  styles  are  reflected  in  prices.  We  show  that  directness  has  become  more  important  
4:91:5578:26:26:92:524:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:relative  to  caring,  and  that  this  shift  has  increased  the  labor  market  returns  to  directness  
4:92:5686:26:25:92:523:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:relative  to  caring.  Lastly,  we  show  that  the  returns  to  interpersonal  styles  vary  across  jobs  
4:93:5795:25:26:92:310:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:with the types of interpersonal tasks performed. 
4:94:5844:26:26:126:523:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:The  approach  in  this  paper  builds  on  intuitive  observations  in  the  psychological  and  
4:95:5942:26:26:92:522:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:management literatures. Caring is needed to create a cooperative environment in which tasks 
4:96:6034:26:26:92:525:507:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:have  to  be  carried  out;  directness  is  needed  to  communicate  accurately.  Especially  in  
4:97:6133:26:26:92:523:481:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:nonhierarchical  settings  interpersonal  interactions  are  essential  because  workers  can  benefit  
4:98:6237:26:26:92:522:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:from  each  other  provided  that  they  are  able  to  communicate  effectively.  The  main  argument  
4:99:6341:26:26:92:522:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:of the model is that effective communication depends  mainly  on  the  balance  between  caring  
4:100:6438:26:26:92:523:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:and  directness.  Psychologists  report  that  by  agreeing  with  someone’s  ideas  and  by  praising  
4:101:6542:26:26:92:522:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:someone’s achievements, cooperation can be gained easily (Aronson, 1995). Interactions are 
4:102:6633:26:26:92:522:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:complicated because it is also important to provide adequate feedback and to convince people 
4:103:6726:26:26:92:523:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:about  different  ideas,  without  losing  too  much  cooperation.  Some  people’s  personalities  are  
4:104:6830:26:26:92:524:299:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:more  suited  to  building  cooperation,  while  others  are  best  when  clear  feedback  has  to  be  
4:105:6934:26:26:92:522:273:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:provided. Most research, management training books, self-help books, and anecdotal evidence 
4:106:7026:26:26:92:505:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:has focused on caring, ignoring directness and the interplay between caring and directness. 
4:107:7118:26:26:126:525:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:People  differ  in  the  tradeoff  between  caring  and  directness.  Caring  people  are  
4:108:7209:26:26:92:523:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:relatively  good  in  establishing  cooperation,  but  have  difficulty  being  critical.  Direct  people  
4:109:7316:26:26:92:526:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:are   able   to   provide   plain   comments   without   reducing   cooperation,   but   generate   less   
4:110:7423:26:26:92:151:143:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:cooperation. 
4:111:7436:26:26:126:525:117:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Jobs  also  differ  in  their  importance  of  caring  and  directness.  Empathy  can  be  a  
4:112:7530:26:0:92:524:91:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:disadvantage  for  salesmen,  engineers  have  to  be  very  clear  in  their  communication  and  
5:113:7630:0:26:92:524:714:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:effective  performance  in  managerial  jobs  often  requires  making  tough  decisions  regarding  
5:114:7730:26:26:92:522:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:others,  such  as  discipline  or  even  dismissal.  Empathy  can  hamper  performance  in  these  jobs  
5:115:7835:26:26:92:523:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:and  the  relatively  least  caring  people  will  be  assigned  to  those  jobs.  Being  relatively  direct  
5:116:7945:26:26:92:523:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:will  be  particularly  valuable  in  such  jobs  because  making  others  take  costly  actions  in  the  
5:117:8052:26:25:92:522:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:manager’s interest requires the ability to persuade, convince and maybe even overrule others’ 
5:118:8146:25:26:92:522:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:interests. The model exhibits a tradeoff between caring and directness in which both types of 
5:119:8240:26:26:92:524:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:interpersonal  interactions  can  be  either  beneficial  or  detrimental  in  terms  of  labor  market  
5:120:8345:26:26:92:141:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:outcomes. 
5:121:8355:26:26:126:525:507:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:There  is  now  a  small  but  burgeoning  economic  literature  on  people  skills.  Most  
5:122:8447:26:26:92:522:481:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:economic studies do not find particularly large effects of interpersonal interactions on wages. 
5:123:8543:26:26:92:522:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:For example, Machin, McIntosh, Vignoles and Viitanen (2001) find positive but rather small 
5:124:8634:26:26:92:526:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:labor  market  returns  to  sociability  variables  in  Britain,  but  they  do  not  consider  the  
5:125:8735:26:26:92:523:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:assignment  of  different  types  of  workers  to  different  jobs.  Mueller  and  Plug  (2006)  estimate  
5:126:8842:26:26:92:522:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:the effect of personality on earnings. Using the five factor model of personality they find that 
5:127:8939:26:26:92:524:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:some  personality  traits  are  penalized  whereas  others  have  positive  returns.  Fortin  (2006)  
5:128:9041:26:26:92:522:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:investigates the impact of a variety of soft skills on earnings and finds that some have positive 
5:129:9139:26:26:92:522:299:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:premiums, while others do not. Krueger and Schkade (2005) show that workers who are more 
5:130:9228:26:26:92:522:273:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:gregarious, based on their behavior off the job, tend to be employed in jobs that involve more 
5:131:9323:26:26:92:524:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:social  interactions.  Kuhn  and  Weinberger  (2005)  provide  evidence  that  people  who  held  
5:132:9421:26:26:92:522:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:leadership positions in high school earn higher wages and are more likely to be employed as 
5:133:9513:26:26:92:525:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:managers.  Finally,  early  work  by  Filer  (1983)  suggests  that  personality  is  important  in  
5:134:9614:26:26:92:392:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:explaining labor market outcomes and gender wage differentials.

6:148:10683:26:26:92:525:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:We  begin  by  discussing  the  literature  on  interpersonal  interactions,  on  which  we  rely  in

6:152:10893:26:26:126:522:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:We start from, but move beyond, the view of interpersonal interactions in psychology, 
6:153:10979:26:26:92:522:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:management and the personality literature, which views interpersonal skills as being friendly,

6:156:11279:26:26:92:524:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:opinions  about  situations  or  how  to  solve  problems.  The  aim  is  to  uncover  if  there  are  
6:157:11382:26:26:92:525:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:different  kinds  of  interpersonal  interactions  that  are  effective  in  different  situations,  in  
6:158:11487:26:26:92:313:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:different occupations, and for different persons.  
6:159:11538:26:26:126:522:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Many work relationships consist of cooperation but go no further than this. They also 
6:160:11624:26:26:92:523:143:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:have  to  be  sustained  even  though  people  may  or  may  not  like  each  other.  There  are  often  
6:161:11729:26:26:92:524:117:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:conflicts  between  those  at  work,  arising  from  opposing  roles,  competition  and  rivalry,  or  
6:162:11832:26:0:92:526:91:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:conflicting   views   about   how   work   should   be   done.   The   importance   of   interpersonal   
7:163:11938:0:26:92:524:714:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:interactions  is  a  major  subject  of  study  in  social  psychology  (Argyle,  1967;  and  Aronson,  
7:164:12042:26:26:92:524:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:1995).  Social  psychologists  look  at  interpersonal  interactions  from  a  skills  point  of  view,  
7:165:12147:26:26:92:522:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:drawing an analogy between people skills and motor skills. Just as someone with good motor 
7:166:12238:26:26:92:522:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:skills may know how to operate a machine, people with good interpersonal skills are thought 
7:167:12330:26:25:92:523:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:to  know  what  to  say  and  how  to  act  in  interpersonal  relationships.  And,  just  as  people  with  
7:168:12439:25:26:92:526:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:good   motor   skills   are   expected   to   earn   higher   wages,   social   psychologists   expect   a   
7:169:12548:26:26:92:523:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:relationship  between  interpersonal  ability  and  pay.  The  estimates  presented  in  these  studies  
7:170:12653:26:26:92:522:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:are not conclusive and often consider one personality trait in isolation (see Mueller and Plug, 
7:171:12749:26:26:92:301:507:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:2006, for a brief discussion of these studies).1 
7:172:12797:26:26:126:524:481:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:The  analogy  between  people  skills  and  motor  skills  ignores  the  different  facets  of  
7:173:12893:26:26:92:524:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:interpersonal  skills,  which  makes  it  important  to  find  the  right  balance  between  them.  As  
7:174:12997:26:26:92:522:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:discussed, interpersonal relationships at work involve being helpful and cooperative, but also 
7:175:13092:26:26:92:425:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:require directness and greater ability in one can interfere with the other.2  
7:176:13170:26:26:126:522:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:The multidimensionality of interpersonal styles is reflected in the personality literature 
7:177:13261:26:26:92:522:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:where  the  Five  Factor  Model  (FFM)  of  personality  is  often  used  as  an  integrated  framework  
7:178:13366:26:26:92:524:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:to  study  the  effects  of  personality  traits  on  behavior.  The  FFM  contains  five  independent  
7:179:13470:26:26:92:523:299:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:categories  sufficient  to  describe  individual  differences  in  personality  (see  McCrae  and  John,  
7:180:13576:26:26:92:525:273:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:1992,  John  and  Srivastava,  1999,  and  Funder,  2001,  for  comprehensive  overviews  and  
7:181:13671:26:26:92:527:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:different   taxonomies   of   traits).   The   dimensions   include   extraversion,   agreeableness,   
7:182:13774:26:26:92:526:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:conscientiousness,  neuroticism  and  openness.  In  particular,  the  separate  dimensions  of  
7:183:13871:26:26:92:522:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:extraversion and agreeableness are strongly related to interpersonal interactions. Extraversion 
7:184:13967:26:35:92:524:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:is  characterized  by  facets  such  as  gregariousness,  assertiveness,  activity  and  outgoingness.

7:186:14119:7:15:92:522:127:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:1  Some  economists  have  taken  a  similar  view  by  including  behavioral  traits  into  wage  equations.  They  have  
7:187:14242:15:11:92:521:112:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:established correlations, but there is no theoretical reason why some traits are rewarded more than others (see for 
7:188:14358:11:7:92:390:101:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:example Bowles, Gintis and Osborne, 2001, for an overview of this literature). 
7:189:14437:7:15:92:521:94:37:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:2 Another phenomenon in psychology is that caring or cooperation is contrasted with destruction in the sense that 
7:190:14551:15:11:92:522:79:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:if  a  person  does  not  cooperate  he  will  destroy  (part  of)  the  relationship  (Goleman,  1996).  We  take  a  different  
7:191:14681:11:0:92:489:68:89:g_d0_f1:89:g_d0_f1:F:route by emphasizing caring as one input and directness as the other input into interpersonal interactions. 
8:192:14790:0:26:92:527:714:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:Agreeableness   includes   facets   such   as   forgivingness,   altruism,   compliance   and   tender   
8:193:14895:26:26:92:523:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:mindedness.  Studies  consistently  find  that  extraversion  and  agreeableness  are  distinct  traits  
8:194:15000:26:26:92:180:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:(Eyseneck, 1991).  
8:195:15019:26:26:126:522:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:The literature in psychology has studied the labor market effects of personality traits, 
8:196:15108:26:25:92:522:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:but  it  does  not  find  strong  and  consistent  effects.  For  instance,  many  studies  find  significant  
8:197:15219:25:26:92:526:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:contributions  of  or  penalties  for  neuroticism,  openness  and  conscientious  to  behavioral  
8:198:15318:26:26:92:525:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:outcomes  but  not  to  agreeableness  or  extraversion.  Often  neuroticism  is  associated  with  
8:199:15418:26:26:92:525:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:penalties  in  terms  of  job  performance  (Barrick  and  Mount,  1991)  and  higher  values  of  
8:200:15517:26:26:92:523:507:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:openness  and  conscientious  are  strongly  correlated  with  higher  cognitive  and  mental  ability  
8:201:15621:26:26:92:524:481:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:which  yield  behavioral  success  (McCrea  and  John,  1992).  Mueller  and  Plug  (2006)  find  
8:202:15719:26:26:92:522:455:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:insignificant returns to agreeableness and extraversion in their wage regressions for males and 
8:203:15815:26:26:92:523:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:females.  We  hypothesize  that  part  of  the  reason  for  these  weak  results  is  that  the  studies  do  
8:204:15926:26:26:92:308:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:not consider the assignment of workers to jobs. 
8:205:15974:26:26:126:523:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:In  translating  these  findings  in  psychology  into  economics,  we  focus  on  two  inputs,  
8:206:16071:26:26:92:522:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:the value of which depends on the occupational setting. The first is an input of high affiliation 
8:207:16169:26:26:92:524:325:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:related  to  the  degree  of  acquiescing,  agreeing,  assisting,  cooperating,  obliging,  initiating,  
8:208:16274:26:26:92:522:299:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:counseling, and advising. This input is needed to establish caring and liking. The other input 
8:209:16369:26:26:92:524:273:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:is  one  of  low  affiliation  related  to  the  degree  of  analyzing,  criticizing,  directing,  judging,  
8:210:16478:26:26:92:522:247:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:instructing, and resisting. This input is necessary to provide assertiveness and to communicate 
8:211:16574:26:26:92:523:221:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:clearly. These inputs are a description of the interpersonal behavior. For simplicity these two 
8:212:16670:26:26:92:522:195:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:inputs are termed caring and directness, which is consistent with the definition of extraversion 
8:213:16767:26:26:92:374:169:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:and agreeableness from the FFM in the personality literature.  
8:214:16830:26:26:126:524:143:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Job circumstances  vary  –  while  some  jobs  mainly  require  caring,  other  jobs  mainly  
8:215:16924:26:26:92:523:117:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:require  directness  or  a  mix  of  the  two.  We  argue  that  there  is  a  tradeoff  between  the  two  
8:216:17032:26:0:92:524:91:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:inputs  and  that  the  balance  between  the  two  determines  productivity.  People  adjust  their  
9:217:17135:0:26:92:524:714:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:behavior  to  the  circumstances,  but  the  ability  to  tradeoff  between  caring  and  directness  
9:218:17237:26:26:92:203:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:depends on personality. 
9:219:17261:26:26:126:522:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Linde (1988) shows that aircrews with successful safety records had a higher level of 
9:220:17347:26:26:92:524:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:mitigation  when  addressing  superiors.  This  level  of  mitigation  was  maintained  in  social  
9:221:17447:26:25:92:525:610:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:relationships.  In  accident  and  emergency  situations  (real  and  simulated),  there  was  less  
9:222:17548:25:26:92:523:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:mitigation  because  messages  delivered  with  mitigation  are  much  less  likely  to  be  acted  on,  
9:223:17653:26:26:92:523:559:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:which  is  consistent  with  some  ability  to  adjust  behavior.  Several  case  studies  suggest  that  
9:224:17759:26:26:92:521:533:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:senior employees speak considerably faster and in ways that are more sophisticated than more

9:228:18157:26:26:92:522:429:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:interact. For example, in professional situations where a certain distance between two parties 
9:229:18252:26:26:92:525:403:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:preserves  identity  rather  than  acceptance,  people  are  less  likely  to  accommodate  their  
9:230:18351:26:26:92:522:377:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:behavior to establish cooperation (Giles and Coupland, 1991). Also, in a hierarchical situation 
9:231:18447:26:26:92:452:351:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:it is often more appropriate for a manager to behave like this towards a worker.

10:245:19515:26:26:92:522:688:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:of a worker.  The economy is characterized by competitive markets in which there is perfect 
10:246:19607:26:26:92:341:662:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:information about job requirements and worker skills.  
10:247:19662:26:26:126:522:636:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:A:Workers face a tradeoff in their interactions with others in that in any given situation

10:249:19856:25:27:92:303:585:127:g_d0_f1:127:g_d0_f1:B:disagreements. This tradeoff can be written as

16:569:32014:26:26:126:523:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:In  our  British  data,  we  construct  a  variable  that  combines  caring  and  directness  and

16:578:32877:26:26:126:522:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The importance of task measures is self-assessed by the respondents to the survey on a 
16:579:32964:26:26:92:522:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:five point scale. The question asked is the following: “In your job, how important is ...?” The 
16:580:33060:26:26:92:523:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:response  scale  offered  is  the  following:  Essential,  very  important,  fairly  important,  not  very  
16:581:33168:26:26:92:524:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:important,  and  not  at  all  important.  Table  A1  in  the  Data  Appendix  presents  the  average

16:583:33346:26:0:126:523:91:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The  effectiveness  of  job  tasks  is  measured  by  the  answers  to  the  following  question:  
17:584:33447:0:26:92:524:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:“When  your  job  involves  ...,  are  you  able  to  do  this  effectively?”  Five  possible  categories  
17:585:33554:26:26:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:were offered: Always, nearly always, often, sometimes and hardly ever. We use the answers 
17:586:33644:26:26:92:523:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:to  this  question  as  a  measure  of  skill  in  estimating  the  assignment  model.  Questions  used  to

17:588:33855:26:25:92:524:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:sociologists,  especially  in  the  literature  regarding  the  importance  of  language  skills  (see  
17:589:33959:25:26:92:522:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Borghans and ter Weel, 2006 for a brief discussion). Answers to self-assessed skill questions 
17:590:34053:26:26:92:522:559:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:may be influenced by social desirability and self-referencing motives. It is not clear how such 
17:591:34149:26:26:92:523:533:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:biases  will  affect  our  estimates.  The  questions  focus  on  respondents’  ability  to  perform  job  
17:592:34256:26:26:92:522:507:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:tasks as opposed to their general ability because these questions are less subject to self-esteem 
17:593:34354:26:26:92:522:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:biases. Furthermore, the questions are directly linked to the tasks that must be fulfilled, which 
17:594:34452:26:26:92:523:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:is  likely  to  directly  influence  the  performance  of  the  job  and  therefore  wages.  Rather  than  
17:595:34559:26:26:92:524:429:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:collecting  information  about  an  abstract  skill,  the  question  is  competence  based.  Finally,

17:606:35507:26:26:126:522:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:In our German data, task measures are also self-assessed. Respondents in the surveys 
17:607:35592:26:26:92:523:117:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:have  to  indicate  whether  they  carry  out  a  certain  task  or  not.  Occupational  requirements  are  
17:608:35700:26:0:92:523:91:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:measured  by  respondents’  job  tasks,  depicted  in  the  survey  by  the  activities  that  employees  
18:609:35808:0:26:92:522:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:have to perform at the workplace. Following Spitz-Oener (2006) we aggregate these activities 
18:610:35901:26:26:92:524:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:into  five  task  categories:  Interpersonal  tasks  (split  into  directness  and  caring),  non-routine  
18:611:36008:26:26:92:522:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:analytical tasks, routine cognitive tasks, routine manual tasks, and non-routine manual tasks. 
18:612:36103:26:26:92:522:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Caring is defined as serving and accommodating; advising customers and clients; and helping 
18:613:36195:26:25:92:523:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:out  others.  Directness  is  defined  as  the  average  of  negotiating,  lobbying,  coordinating  and  
18:614:36300:25:26:92:527:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:organizing;   teaching   or   training;   selling,   buying,   or   advertising;   and   entertaining   or

18:625:37236:26:26:92:523:299:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:The  correlation  coefficients  suggest  that  directness  and  caring  are  positively  correlated  with

18:627:37440:26:26:92:522:247:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:higher. In addition, the level caring in an occupation is positively correlated with the fraction 
18:628:37538:26:26:92:522:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:of  women  in  that  occupation.  In  the  empirical  analysis  we  always  control  for  the  fraction  of  
18:629:37647:26:26:92:524:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:women  in  an  occupation  and  include  dummies  for  educational  levels.  Note  that  we  are  
18:630:37745:26:26:92:524:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interested  in  the  tradeoff  between  caring  and  directness  and  not  in  differences  in  absolute  
18:631:37851:26:26:92:522:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:levels of caring and directness. A person who is better in both caring and directness will face 
18:632:37947:26:38:92:374:117:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:similar tradeoffs compared to a person who is worse on both.

19:640:38411:25:26:92:523:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:importance  of  caring  and  directness  across  occupations,  and  then  present  estimates  relating

19:645:38731:26:26:126:526:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:For   most   jobs   interpersonal   tasks   are   important.   Nevertheless   there   are   large   
19:646:38831:26:26:92:522:429:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:differences in the importance of interpersonal tasks across jobs. Table A5 lists the importance 
19:647:38927:26:26:92:522:403:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:of interpersonal tasks in the 25 largest occupations in Britain in 1997. The first column reports 
19:648:39025:26:26:92:523:377:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:the  importance  of  directness,  the  second  column  reports  the  importance  of  caring,  the  third  
19:649:39131:26:26:92:523:351:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:column  reports  the  ratio  of  the  importance  of  directness  relative  to  caring,  and  the  fourth  
19:650:39238:26:26:92:526:325:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:column   reports   the   absolute   difference   between   the   importance   of   directness   and   the   
19:651:39346:26:26:92:522:299:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:importance of caring. The occupations are ranked by the ratio of the importance of directness 
19:652:39440:26:26:92:523:273:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:relative  to  caring.  Service  jobs,  in  which  dealing  with  others  and  taking  care  of  others  is  
19:653:39548:26:26:92:523:247:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:important,  are  the  most  caring  occupations.  In  these  jobs  not  only  is  caring  important,  but  
19:654:39655:26:26:92:522:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness is relatively unimportant. At the other side of the spectrum, jobs that involve selling 
19:655:39754:26:26:92:522:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:and influencing others place the most weight on directness. Although these jobs also require 
19:656:39847:26:26:92:523:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:caring  (to  establish  relationships  with  others),  the  mean  directness  in  these  occupations  is  
19:657:39953:26:26:92:523:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:among  the  highest  and  the  absolute  difference  between  directness  and  caring  is  largest  in

20:661:40279:26:26:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:is related to the other task variables formally by regressing each task variable on the ratio of 
20:662:40376:26:26:92:522:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness and caring, controlling for level of education and gender. The only task showing a 
20:663:40470:26:26:92:507:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:relationship was math for which the coefficient (standard error) was equal to 0.101 (0.043).

20:666:40599:26:26:126:524:559:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:A  person’s  abilities  in  interpersonal  tasks  will  affect  the  occupation  in  which  he  
20:667:40695:26:26:92:522:533:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:works. We check for this assignment by estimating the relationship between youth sociability 
20:668:40788:26:26:92:522:507:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:and the importance of caring and directness in the occupation in which a person works as an 
20:669:40880:26:26:92:523:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:adult.  Youths  who  are  more  caring  are  expected  to  be  in  occupations  where  caring  tasks  are  
20:670:40987:26:26:92:522:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:more important as adults. Given the often difficult dynamics of adolescent society, we expect 
20:671:41081:26:26:92:524:429:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:popularity  to  be  more  related  to  directness  (see  Eder,  Evans,  and  Parker,  2003),  and  more  
20:672:41186:26:26:92:522:403:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:popular children to be employed in occupations where directness is most important. Evidence 
20:673:41278:26:26:92:522:377:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:that these aspects of youth sociability are correlated with the importance of interpersonal tasks 
20:674:41376:26:26:92:522:351:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:in adult occupations will validate our measures of the importance of caring and directness and 
20:675:41471:26:26:92:524:325:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:show  that  variations  in  the  extent  to  which  people  are  caring  and  direct  are  an  important  
20:676:41577:26:26:92:524:299:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:determinant  of  occupational  choice.  How  youth  sociability  is  related  to  the  importance  of  
20:677:41680:26:26:92:523:273:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:other  tasks  will  depend  on  whether  interpersonal  skills  complement  other  skills.  If  they  do,  
20:678:41787:26:26:92:523:247:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:people  with  stronger  interpersonal  skills  will  tend  to  be  in  jobs  where  other  tasks  are  more  
20:679:41896:26:26:92:523:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:important.  The  relationship  will  also  depend  on  whether  youth  sociability  is  associated  with  
20:680:42002:26:26:92:308:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:uncontrolled aspects of ability and motivation.  
20:681:42051:26:26:126:522:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:We test our model’s assignment implications by regressing the importance of job tasks 
20:682:42137:26:26:92:522:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:in a person’s occupation on measures of youth sociability. Our measures of sociability come 
20:683:42229:26:26:92:525:117:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:from  the  1986  wave  of  the  BCS,  which  includes  a  variety  of  behavioral  measures  of  
20:684:42326:26:0:92:522:91:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:sociability, including the number of friends the respondent has; the frequency with which the 
21:685:42422:0:26:92:524:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:respondents  spent  time  with  friends  during  the  school  year  and  during  holidays;  and  the  
21:686:42524:26:26:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:frequency with which the respondents spent time with friends during their leisure (as opposed

21:688:42723:26:26:92:523:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:wave  of  the  BCS  includes  data  for  these  individuals  when  they  are  30  years  old.  To  obtain  
21:689:42830:26:25:92:523:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:measures  of  the  importance  of  directness  and  caring  and  other  tasks,  each  BCS  respondent  
21:690:42933:25:26:92:522:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:was assigned the mean of the task variables for his three digit occupation calculated from the 
21:691:43028:26:26:92:143:559:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:2001 BSS. 
21:692:43038:26:26:126:522:533:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Table I presents the regression results. The first row shows that all of the indicators of 
21:693:43129:26:26:92:523:507:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:sociability  are  positively  correlated  with  the  importance  of  interpersonal  tasks  in  a  person’s  
21:694:43237:26:26:92:522:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:three digit occupation. We next focus on how youth sociability is related to the importance of 
21:695:43332:26:26:92:523:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness  and  caring  on  the  respondents’  adult  jobs.  We  have  a  self-description  as  having  a  
21:696:43440:26:26:92:522:429:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:caring nature, which we expect to be correlated with taking a job where caring is important. 
21:697:43533:26:26:92:522:403:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:We have two variables that capture popularity, a self-description as being popular or outgoing 
21:698:43628:26:26:92:522:377:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:and the number of friends the person has. The second and third rows show these results. It is 
21:699:43722:26:26:92:524:351:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:striking  that  differences  in  social  character  in  terms  of  being  a  caring  person  are  strongly  
21:700:43830:26:26:92:523:325:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:related  to  the  importance  of  caring  in  the  current  occupation,  but  not  to  the  importance  of  
21:701:43938:26:26:92:522:299:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness.  Being  popular,  as  measured  by  the  self-descriptions  or  the  number  of  friends,  is  
21:702:44045:26:26:92:525:273:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:strongly  related  to  being  in  an  occupation  where  directness  is  important,  but  not  to  the  
21:703:44149:26:26:92:522:247:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:importance of caring. The other behavioral measures of sociability, which presumably do not 
21:704:44241:26:26:92:524:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:pick  up  specific  types  of  sociability,  are  related  to  the  importance  of  both  directness  and  
21:705:44348:26:26:92:126:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:caring. 
21:706:44356:26:26:126:524:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The  remaining  rows  report  the  relationship  between  the  youth  sociability  measures  
21:707:44449:26:26:92:522:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:and the importance of other job tasks. With the exception of planning activities, which likely 
21:708:44544:26:26:92:406:117:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:have an interactive component, there are no systematic relationships. 
21:709:44614:26:0:126:526:91:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The   last   row   replicates   studies   that   simply   include   sociability   in   an   earnings

22:711:44822:26:26:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:sociability  is  not  capturing  differences  in  ability.  Below  we  show  that,  once  we  account  for  
22:712:44930:26:26:92:370:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:their multifaceted nature, people skills strongly affect wages. 
22:713:44994:26:26:126:522:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:A potential concern with the way in which we relate sociability indicators at age 16 to 
22:714:45082:26:25:92:523:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:jobs  with  particular  features  at  age  30  is  that  more  direct  people  put  more  emphasis  on  the  
22:715:45191:25:26:92:522:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:direct tasks they carry out rather than on the caring tasks in their jobs. The same might be true 
22:716:45289:26:26:92:523:559:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:for  more  caring  people  putting  more  emphasis  on  caring  tasks  when  they  are  interviewed.  
22:717:45391:26:26:92:522:533:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:This  concern  derives  from  the  fact  that  the  information  on  the  task  content  of  the  job  comes

22:719:45598:26:26:92:523:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:estimates  are  biased  in  this  way,  we  constructed  caring  and  directness  indicators  from  the

23:760:48869:27:0:92:394:88:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:relative to caring on the wages of the people in an occupation, tβ. 
24:761:48939:0:26:126:525:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Provided  that  individual  ability  is  not  correlated  with  the  interpersonal  tasks,  a  
24:762:49034:26:30:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:regression of ijtw on jtx and iz at a point in time will give the price of interpersonal tasks. By 
24:763:49133:30:26:92:522:658:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:running these regressions on data from a variety of years, it is possible to determine how the 
24:764:49228:26:26:92:334:632:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:prices of interpersonal tasks have changed over time. 
24:765:49282:26:26:126:523:606:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:  Tables  II  and  III  present  cross-sectional  wage  regressions  for  Britain  and  Germany.  
24:766:49380:26:26:92:526:580:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:The   coefficients   for   the   importance   of   directness   relative   to   caring   are   positive   and   
24:767:49492:26:26:92:522:554:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:statistically significant in all years for both countries, indicating that directness has a positive 
24:768:49593:26:26:92:522:528:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:return relative to caring. The measures for the two countries are different, making it difficult 
24:769:49690:26:26:92:522:502:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:to  compare  the  results  directly,  but  we  find  that  directness  has  a  higher  return  than  caring  in  
24:770:49803:26:26:92:522:476:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:both  countries,  increasing  our  confidence  in  the  estimates.  Moreover  the  return  to  directness  
24:771:49910:26:26:92:522:450:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:relative  to  caring  increases  over  time  in  both  countries.  For  Britain  a  one  standard  deviation  
24:772:50020:26:26:92:523:424:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:increase  in  relative  directness  increases  wages  by  9.6  percent  in  1997  and  10.8  percent  in  
24:773:50126:26:26:92:522:398:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:2001. For Germany a one standard deviation increase in the relative importance of directness 
24:774:50219:26:26:92:482:372:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:would increase wages by 3.8 (1979), 5.2 (1985), 8.5 (1991), and 10.2 (1998) percent.  
24:775:50305:26:26:126:522:346:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A: In keeping with our estimates, the reported importance of directness increases relative 
24:776:50393:26:26:92:525:320:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:to  caring.  To  better  understand  these  shifts  we  decompose  this  increase  in  the  relative  
24:777:50495:26:26:92:521:294:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:importance of directness into within and between occupation components. Overall, there is an 
24:778:50588:26:26:92:522:268:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:increase  in  the  relative  importance  of  directness  by  0.002  points  per  year  between  1997  and  
24:779:50695:26:26:92:523:242:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:2001 (from 0.719 to 0.726) in the UK, and this increase is statistically significant at the one 
24:780:50791:26:26:92:522:216:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:percent level. When the relative importance of directness in occupations in 1997 is weighted 
24:781:50884:26:26:92:525:190:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:by  the  change  in  employment  in  each  occupation  between  1997  and  2001,  the  relative  
24:782:50981:26:26:92:524:164:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:importance  of  directness  increased  by  0.005  points  per  year  due  to  shifts  in  employment  
24:783:51083:26:26:92:524:138:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:between  occupations,  and  this  increase  is  significant  at  the  one  percent  level.  The  within  
24:784:51188:26:26:92:522:112:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:occupation change is negative: when we weight the importance of people skills in occupations 
24:785:51281:26:0:92:522:86:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:in 1997 and 2001 by employment in 2001, the relative importance of directness falls by 0.003 
25:786:51376:0:26:92:165:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:points per year. 
25:787:51393:26:26:126:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A: In Germany, the importance of directness relative to caring rose substantially by some 
25:788:51480:26:26:92:523:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:0.015  points  per  year  between  1979  and  1997  (from  0.765  to  1.033).  Between  occupation  
25:789:51580:26:26:92:522:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:shifts account for an increase in the relative importance of directness of 0.003 points per year; 
25:790:51678:26:25:92:522:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:this is significant at the one percent level. The importance increased by 0.013 points per year 
25:791:51774:25:26:92:523:585:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:within  occupations.  Thus,  in  contrast  to  Britain,  the  within  occupation  change  is  larger  than  
25:792:51882:26:26:92:296:559:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:the between occupation change in Germany.

25:795:51946:26:26:126:523:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:One  concern  with  our  estimates  of  the  returns  to  directness  relative  to  caring  is  that  
25:796:52048:26:27:92:524:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:there  may  be  a  correlation  between  the  importance  of  directness  relative  to  caring  in  an  
25:797:52152:27:29:92:523:428:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:occupation  and  the  unobserved  ability,  iγ,  of  the  people  in  that  occupation.  Although  the  
25:798:52256:29:26:92:527:399:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:cross-sectional   wage   estimates   combined   with   the   within   and   between   occupations   
25:799:52356:26:26:92:523:373:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:components  discussed  above  do  not  suggest  such  a  relationship,  we  probe  these  results  in  a  
25:800:52462:26:26:92:524:347:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:number  of  ways.  First,  we  relate  changes  in  wages  to  changes  in  the  importance  of  the  
25:801:52564:26:26:92:524:321:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interpersonal  tasks  within  occupations.  Implicit  in  this  approach  is  that  any  differences  in  
25:802:52670:26:26:92:441:295:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:unobserved ability across occupations do not change substantially over time. 
25:803:52747:26:26:126:524:269:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Figure  I  plots  changes  in  log  hourly  wages  against  changes  in  the  importance  of  
25:804:52841:26:26:92:523:243:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness  relative  to  caring  at  the  occupation  level  in  Britain  between  1997  and  2001.  The  
25:805:52948:26:26:92:526:217:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:size   of   the   bubbles   is   proportional   to   occupational   employment.   There   is   a   positive

25:807:53160:26:26:92:523:165:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:hourly wages. The slope (standard error) of this relationship (weighted by the square root of 
25:808:53254:26:26:92:313:139:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:employment in the occupation) is 0.141 (0.035). 
25:809:53302:26:26:126:525:113:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Table  IV  reports  regressions  of  changes  in  log  wages  on  the  importance  of  the

26:811:53492:0:26:92:522:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:task measures and human capital variables. The estimates show a strong relationship between 
26:812:53584:26:26:92:523:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:changes  in  the  relative  importance  of  directness  and  changes  in  wages,  although  one  that  is  
26:813:53691:26:26:92:523:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:weaker  than  the  cross-sectional  estimates.  A  one  standard  deviation  change  in  the  relative

26:818:54196:26:26:92:275:533:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:results are similar to the OLS estimates.

31:971:64358:26:26:92:522:481:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:direct relative to caring when moving from any given job to a job that requires slightly more 
31:972:64452:26:26:92:525:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directness.  A  large  derivative  implies  a  low  supply  of  workers  with  the  usual  set  of

32:1006:66061:26:26:92:523:607:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:average  an  oversupply  of  relatively  caring  workers,  yielding  a  premium  for  relatively  direct  
32:1007:66167:26:25:92:523:581:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:workers. The level of directness itself is generally insignificant and unstable, suggesting that 
32:1008:66264:25:26:92:523:556:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:there  are  no  compensating  wage  differentials.  When  we  include  an  interaction  between  the

32:1010:66463:26:26:92:523:504:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interaction  is  insignificant,  indicating  that  the  negative  relationship  is  rather  constant  across  
32:1011:66573:26:26:92:523:478:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:the  job  distribution.  These  results  suggest  that  workers  are  on  average  less  direct  than  jobs  
32:1012:66682:26:26:92:522:452:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:require. On the other hand, there do not appear to be substantial differences between workers’

32:1024:67663:26:26:126:525:140:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:  The  estimates  indicate  that  the  relationship  between  wages  and  the  interpersonal  
32:1025:67757:26:26:92:522:114:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:requirements of a job are largely explained by the supply and demand for directness relative 
32:1026:67850:26:0:92:525:88:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:to  caring.  Confirming  the  importance  of  supply  and  demand  relative  to  compensating  
33:1027:67947:0:26:92:523:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:differentials, for instance, the required level of caring or directness does not influence wages 
33:1028:68044:26:26:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:directly. Our estimates also suggest that the failure to account for differences in the returns to

33:1037:68694:26:26:92:523:455:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:individual  labor  market  outcomes  and  are  becoming  more  important,  economists  have  done  
33:1038:68793:26:26:92:524:429:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:little  to  analyze  their  economic  consequences  in  terms  of  wages  and  job  assignment.  This  
33:1039:68896:26:26:92:522:403:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:paper  provides  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  developing  a  framework  to  understand  the  labor  
33:1040:69005:26:26:92:525:377:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:market  consequences  of  interpersonal  styles  and  demonstrating  the  relationship  between  
33:1041:69102:26:26:92:310:351:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interpersonal styles and labor market outcomes. 
33:1042:69150:26:26:126:526:325:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The   framework   focuses   on   tradeoff   between   directness,   which   facilitates   clear   
33:1043:69248:26:26:92:525:299:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:communication,  and  caring,  which  establishes  cooperation.  Workers  are  assumed  to  be  
33:1044:69343:26:26:92:523:273:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:heterogeneous  with  respect  to  these  inputs  and  occupations  are  assumed  to  require  different  
33:1045:69448:26:26:92:522:247:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:levels of both inputs. Workers are most productive when they work in a job that best matches 
33:1046:69541:26:26:92:522:221:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:their style best, but any given worker adjusts the extent to which he is direct relative to caring 
33:1047:69640:26:26:92:522:195:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:to suit his circumstances. Our model yields a number of results for wages and the assignment 
33:1048:69733:26:26:92:523:169:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:of  workers  to  jobs.  For  instance,  workers  with  a  comparative  advantage  in  caring  will  be  
33:1049:69837:26:26:92:522:143:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:assigned to relatively caring jobs, within which they earn higher wages. The returns to caring 
33:1050:69932:26:26:92:391:117:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:and directness will be determined by relative supply and demand. 
33:1051:69997:26:0:126:525:91:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:We  test  the  model’s  implications  for  occupational  assignment  using  British  data.

34:1061:70614:13:13:126:523:526:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The  British  Skills  Surveys  (BSS)  comprise  two  cross-sectional  surveys  conducted  in  
34:1062:70708:13:13:92:526:513:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:1997  and  2001;  each  contains  a  representative  sample  of  the  British  population.  The  
34:1063:70805:13:13:92:524:500:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interviewers  assess  the  importance  of  36  job  activities  and  key  skills,  including  problem  
34:1064:70908:13:13:92:524:487:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:solving,  noticing  mistakes,  mathematical  ability,  reading  and  writing,  physical  skills,  the  
34:1065:71011:13:13:92:526:474:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:ability   to   plan   activities,   knowledge   about   products   and   workplace   and   interpersonal   
34:1066:71118:13:13:92:522:461:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:interactions. Nine job task categories are constructed from these detailed job tasks. These are 
34:1067:71214:13:13:92:523:448:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:listed  in  Table  A1.  The  changes  in  the  importance  of  job  tasks  are  analyzed  in  Section  IV.  
34:1068:71322:13:13:92:523:435:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Ashton,  Davies,  Felstead  and  Green  (1998)  provide  a  detailed  overview  of  the  interview  set  
34:1069:71427:13:13:92:522:422:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:up  and  the  design  of  the  BSS  survey.  They  also  present  basic  analyses  of  the  core  variables.  
34:1070:71537:13:13:92:433:409:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Felstead, Gallie and Green (2002) provide an overview of the second BSS. 
34:1071:71610:13:13:126:523:396:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The usual approach in job analyses is for experts to visit people at their workplace to 
34:1072:71698:13:13:92:522:383:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:evaluate job requirements. In practice each occupation is evaluated based only upon a couple 
34:1073:71791:13:13:92:522:370:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:of representative examples, and these evaluation studies are updated infrequently. Information 
34:1074:71886:13:13:92:524:357:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:from  job  analyses  therefore  reflects  experiences  gathered  over  a  long  period  of  time,  and  
34:1075:71990:13:13:92:524:344:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:might  miss  changes  in  portions  of  an  occupation  that  differ  from  the  typical  job  in  the  
34:1076:72094:13:13:92:521:331:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:occupation title. The main advantage of the BSS data is that information is obtained about job 
34:1077:72189:13:13:92:522:318:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:requirements  at  two  distinct  points  in  time  for  all  jobs,  with  the  data  being  representative  of  
34:1078:72301:13:13:92:522:305:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:all people within each category. The two waves of the BSS codes job requirements on a five 
34:1079:72392:13:13:92:522:292:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:point scale, which gives us a much more nuanced picture compared to the binary information 
34:1080:72483:13:13:92:190:279:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:in most job analyses.

34:1084:72786:13:12:92:522:227:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:SOC90 was published to replace both the Classification of Occupations 1980 (CO80) and the 
34:1085:72876:12:13:92:522:215:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Classification  of  Occupations  and  Dictionary  of  Occupational  Titles  (CODOT).  The  SOC90  
34:1086:72974:13:13:92:522:202:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:includes nine major groups divided into 22 sub-major groups of occupations. These 22 groups 
34:1087:73066:13:13:92:523:189:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:can be divided into 371 unit groups, which are defined as occupations. These unit groups are 
34:1088:73159:13:13:92:522:176:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:the aggregate results of over 26,000 job titles. All observations used are for workers who are 
34:1089:73254:13:13:92:265:163:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:not self-employed and aged 20 to 60.  
34:1090:73292:13:13:126:527:150:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Standard   U.K.   measures   of   education   are   used.   These   are   university   degree,

34:1092:73482:13:13:92:524:124:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:degrees  are  equivalent  to  a  U.S.  college  degree.  NVQ3  would  be  similar  to  some  college,  
34:1093:73585:13:13:92:522:111:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:NVQ2 and NVQ1 are comparable to a high school degree, and workers without a degree are 
34:1094:73672:13:13:92:522:98:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:dropouts. In 1997 (2001) 22.3 (30.4) percent of the respondents in the survey had obtained a

35:1097:73971:0:13:92:523:714:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:average  (standard  deviation)  age  of  the  respondents  is  39.0  (10.3)  in  1997  and  increases  to  
35:1098:74078:13:13:92:521:701:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:40.3 (10.4) in 2001. The average (standard deviation) gross hourly wage is GB₤ 7.43 (9.25) in 
35:1099:74172:13:13:92:315:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:1997 and increases to GB₤ 9.75 (10.95) in 2001. 
35:1100:74220:13:13:126:522:675:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:The analysis in Section V.D. requires the use of both the importance and effectiveness 
35:1101:74307:13:13:92:523:662:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:of  job  tasks.  In  the  1997  BSS  the  effectiveness  of  the  36  job  tasks  is  gathered  by  using  the  
35:1102:74419:13:13:92:525:649:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:answers  to  the  following  question:  “If  your  job  requires  ...  are  you  able  to  do  this  
35:1103:74520:13:13:92:523:636:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:effectively?”  The  answers  range  from  always  to  never.  The  answers  to  these  questions  are

36:1149:78469:13:13:92:522:688:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:Development Study (NCDS) and originates in the British Birth Survey of over 17,000 babies 
36:1150:78559:13:13:92:522:675:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:born in Britain in the week 5-11 April 1970. We use the BCS and not the NCDS because the

36:1152:78693:13:13:126:523:649:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:A:Four  major  follow-up  surveys  have  monitored  the  changing  health,  education,  social

36:1154:78887:13:13:92:522:623:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:1996. Our focus is on the sociability questions asked in 1986 when the cohort members were 
36:1155:78978:13:12:92:523:610:128:g_d0_f1:128:g_d0_f1:B:16  years  old.  The  latest  major  survey  was  held  in  2000  and  contains  data  on  respondents’
