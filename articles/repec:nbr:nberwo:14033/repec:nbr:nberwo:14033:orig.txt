2:31:1694:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:32:1702:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We argue that the question of whether and when policy reform works should be investigated together
2:33:1800:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:with the political economy factors responsible for distortionary policies in the first place.  These not
2:34:1904:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:only determine the initial distortions, but also often shape policy in the post-reform environment. 
2:35:2004:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:Distortionary policies are more likely to be adopted when politicians are unconstrained and unaccountable
2:36:2109:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:to citizens.  This reasoning implies that policy reform should have modest effects in societies where
2:37:2210:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:the political system already places constraints on politicians.  It also implies, however, that in societies
2:38:2318:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:with weak political constraints, which are often those adopting the most distortionary policies, policy
2:39:2421:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:reforms may be ineffective because the underlying political economy problems are not typically altered
2:40:2523:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:by these reforms.  Policy reform should therefore have its largest effect in societies with intermediate
2:41:2627:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:levels of constraints.  In addition, when policy reform is (partly) effective, it may lead to a deterioration
2:42:2736:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:in other (unreformed) components of policy in order to satisfy the underlying demands on politicians
2:43:2836:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:– a phenomenon we call the seesaw effect.  We provide reduced-form evidence consistent with these
2:44:2933:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:ideas by looking at the effect of central bank independence on inflation.  The evidence is consistent
2:45:3034:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:with the notion that central bank reforms have reduced inflation in societies with intermediate constraints
2:46:3141:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:and have had no or little effects in countries with the high and low levels of constraints.  We also present
2:47:3249:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:some evidence suggesting that, consistent with the seesaw effect, in countries where central bank reforms
2:48:3354:14:42:72:357:364:12:Times:12:Times:reduce inflation, government expenditure tends to increase.

3:74:3840:0:29:82:195:673:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:75:3855:29:19:82:543:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Institutional and policy reforms are often promoted as a way to improve economic performance and
3:76:3951:19:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth in poor countries. Reforms that have received substantial attention over the past decade or
3:77:4049:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so include trade opening, \fnancial liberalization, judicial reform, privatization, reduction of entry
3:78:4151:18:19:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:barriers, tax reform, removal of targeted industrial subsidies, and central bank independence, a
3:79:4247:19:19:82:543:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:list that includes not just the original \Washington consensus," but also a range of other reforms.
3:80:4346:19:18:99:543:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although there are sound economic theories suggesting why these reforms might be important
3:81:4436:18:19:82:543:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in improving economic performance, the experience of the last decade shows that these reforms
3:82:4529:19:19:82:543:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rarely seem to have the e-ects anticipated by their proponents. van de Walle (2001), for instance,
3:83:4627:19:31:82:534:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:summarizes the ine-ectiveness of two decades of reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa by noting that
3:84:4719:31:18:126:516:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\At the dawn of the twenty-\frst century, most of sub-Saharan Africa remains mired
3:85:4801:18:19:110:516:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in economic crisis despite two decades of donor-sponsored reform e-orts ... many if
3:86:4884:19:19:110:516:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not most African countries are poorer today than they were twenty years ago." (pp.
3:87:4966:19:30:110:129:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3-4)
3:88:4970:30:19:99:543:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Similarly, Velasco (2005), the current Chilean \fnance minister, articulates the widespread
3:89:5061:19:31:82:392:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disillusion of the impact of reforms in Latin America. He argues:
3:90:5126:31:18:126:516:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\Reformers argued, persuasively, that growth was being held back by distortions.
3:91:5206:18:19:110:516:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Many of the distortions were government induced, the result of poorly conceived poli-
3:92:5291:19:19:110:516:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cies. Change policy and the economy will ful\fll its potential ... A decade later the
3:93:5376:19:19:110:516:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:view is less sanguine: with fewer bad-policy distortions, the Latin American economies
3:94:5462:19:18:110:516:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:grew in the 1990s at half the rate attained during precisely those decades when the
3:95:5545:18:19:110:516:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allegedly distorting policies of import substitution reached their peak: the 1960s and
3:96:5631:19:31:110:176:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1970s." (p. 2)
3:97:5645:31:18:99:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why do seemingly-sensible reforms fail to generate the bene\fts that they promise? The critics
3:98:5739:18:19:82:543:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of reform emphasize, among other things, the potential negative e-ects that international trade
3:99:5834:19:19:82:543:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might create for infant industries, the instabilities that might be induced by \fnancial liberalization,
3:100:5938:19:18:82:543:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or the usefulness of a variety of regulations, government ownership and industrial policy in less-
3:101:6036:18:19:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:developed economies (see Rodrik, 2005). Stiglitz, for example argues (2002, p. 16) that in many
3:102:6131:19:0:82:106:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cases
4:103:6137:0:19:126:516:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\...the economic policies that evolved into the Washington Consensus and were
4:104:6214:19:19:110:516:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:introduced into developing countries were not appropriate for countries in the earlier
4:105:6300:19:30:110:300:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stages of development or ... transition."
4:106:6341:30:19:82:455:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This is not the only way to interpret the apparent failure of reforms, however.
4:107:6420:19:19:99:543:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we emphasize that to understand why reforms do or do not work, it is necessary
4:108:6513:19:19:82:543:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to investigate the political economy of distortionary policies. Our general argument is that the
4:109:6609:19:18:82:543:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis of whether, and which, reforms will lead to improved economic performance should start
4:110:6704:18:19:82:543:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with an understanding ofwhy distortionary policies were in place to start with. We illustrate that
4:111:6802:19:19:82:543:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this perspective leads to some simple, and testable, ideas on when policy reform will be more
4:112:6895:19:18:82:440:527:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:e-ective, and we provide preliminary evidence consistent with these ideas.1
4:113:6970:18:19:99:543:509:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Much of the economic literature on policy reform and most of the advice given by international
4:114:7064:19:19:82:543:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutions implicitly or explicitly assume that distortionary policies were used by \accident". Ei-
4:115:7165:19:18:82:543:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ther these policies were in place and remained there as a historical legacy, or they are the outcome
4:116:7265:18:19:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of some mistaken economic theory or shortsightedness on the part of policymakers. Though one
4:117:7357:19:19:82:543:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can undoubtedly \fnd instances where mistaken economic theories led to disastrous policies, few
4:118:7452:19:19:82:543:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policymakers create hyperin\rations or large budget de\fcits because they think that this is good
4:119:7549:19:18:82:543:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the economy. Instead, the political economy constraints and the incentives facing politicians in
4:120:7649:18:19:82:543:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many societies with weak checks and balances or poor accountability make it bene\fcial or conve-
4:121:7745:19:19:82:543:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nient for them to pursue a range of distortionary policies in order to satisfy powerful constituencies
4:122:7847:19:18:82:195:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or to enrich themselves.
4:123:7871:18:19:99:543:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:What might explain the presence of bad policies? The literature on political economy sug-
4:124:7960:19:19:82:543:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gests that bad policies arise because the preferences of politicians or those with power are not
4:125:8056:19:19:82:543:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aligned with those of the rest of the society. The politically powerful may have an incentive to
4:126:8152:19:18:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distort policies or institutions so as to redistribute income or power to themselves (e.g., Acemoglu,
4:127:8253:18:19:82:543:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2006). Their ability to do so will depend on the constraints they face, and more generally, on the
4:128:8351:19:19:82:543:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:structure of political institutions. A potent source of policy failure is the absence of constraints
4:129:8451:19:18:82:543:209:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on political o-ceholders (e.g., North and Weingast, 1989, Persson, Roland and Tabellini, 1997,
4:130:8545:18:19:82:543:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Henisz, 2000, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2005). This perspective emphasizes that policy
4:131:8637:19:19:82:543:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform takes place in an environment where initial policies served political purposes|for exam-
4:132:8732:19:19:82:543:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ple, redistributing resources to groups with power and in\ruence. This implies that those who
4:133:8825:19:15:82:543:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expect to see their rents or privileges disappear as a result of policy reform are likely to use their
4:134:8927:15:15:95:543:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1An alternative and complementary perspective is that reformers, who are aware of the political constraints
4:135:9034:15:11:82:543:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:underlying policy decisions, may push for reforms and emphasize their economic costs as part of a bargaining
4:136:9142:11:11:82:543:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:process among political groups and policymakers. This perspective, though plausible, has not been developed in
4:137:9252:11:0:82:398:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the literature and must also ultimately model the political economy of reform.
5:138:9331:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political power to prevent the e-ective implementation of the reforms. Alternatively, the political
5:139:9430:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:realities may make it impossible or impractical for those entrusted with the implementation of
5:140:9524:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:reforms to carry them out. This implies that there may be a big gap between reformsde jure
5:141:9614:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:andde facto. In particular, only policy reforms that the groups with political power that were
5:142:9708:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previously bene\fting from distortionary policies cannot easily over-ride, circumvent or ignore can
5:143:9807:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:achieve their objectives. Whether or not these groups can thwart reforms in turn depends on the
5:144:9902:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints on politicians and on the process of policymaking. This argument suggests that in
5:145:9995:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:societies such as many in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there are only few constraints and checks
5:146:10088:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on politicians and on politically powerful groups, policy reform is unlikely to be very e-ective.
5:147:10185:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This is consistent with the case study evidence and argument in van de Walle (1993, 2001). He
5:148:10278:18:31:82:260:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:illustrates that for African politicians

5:152:10506:31:19:126:516:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\Often, the policies have changed on paper, but in practice, something resembling
5:153:10587:19:19:110:516:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the status quo ante continues to prevail. In some cases, the old policies were reinstated
5:154:10676:19:18:110:516:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under a new name or with some new policy objective ... In other cases, governments

5:157:10870:31:18:99:543:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This ine-ectiveness of reform is not surprising; few people would expect privatization, \fnancial

5:162:11353:19:19:82:543:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe greater independence.2Clearly, however, increased independence
5:163:11444:19:19:82:543:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Central Bank in Zimbabwe did little to restraint the subsequent monetary policy of the
5:164:11537:19:18:82:543:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:government. This somewhat extreme example therefore illustrates that a major reason why policy
5:165:11631:18:19:82:543:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform will often fail is because of the absence of a functioning accountability system and lack of
5:166:11730:19:16:82:264:136:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:constraints and checks on politicians.3
5:167:11769:16:15:95:543:120:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2The 1995 Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act legislated a greater degree of autonomy for the central bank. After
5:168:11875:15:11:82:543:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:1995, the bank had its own budget and could decide on its own \fnances. The Act also legislated the control of
5:169:11985:11:7:82:292:94:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in\ration as the unique objective of monetary policy.
5:170:12038:7:0:95:543:87:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3This example and our results below raise the question of why potentially ine-ective reforms are implemented in
6:171:12150:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Does this imply that better political institutions and transparency always increase the impact
6:172:12244:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of reforms?  Not necessarily.  Policy reform will have its greatest e-ect when the pre-reform
6:173:12337:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies are highly distortionary. However, we would not expect societies with a functioning system
6:174:12436:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of accountability and with checks on politicians to be those pursuing such highly distortionary
6:175:12531:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies. For example, in\ration was already low in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, before the
6:176:12626:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bank of England became independent in 1998.4Thus the room for a large e-ect from CBI reform
6:177:12717:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was limited. Instead, high in\ration or even hyperin\ration are much more likely in societies with
6:178:12815:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weak institutions than those where politicians are accountable, via elections or other means, to
6:179:12911:19:19:82:195:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the population at large.
6:180:12935:19:18:99:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The arguments in the previous two paragraphs suggest that once we take a political economy
6:181:13025:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:perspective, policy reform should not be expected to be (equally) e-ective in every society and that
6:182:13125:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the functioning and success of policy reform should depend on political institutions and political
6:183:13223:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints. More speci\fcally, these arguments suggest that there should be a potentially non-
6:184:13318:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monotonic relationship between the extent of constraints on politicians and the e-ectiveness of
6:185:13413:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy reform. The importance of political economy factors in understanding and evaluating the
6:186:13507:19:19:82:362:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:success of policy reform is our main message in this paper.
6:187:13566:19:18:99:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We develop this perspective by investigating the interplay between policy reform and institu-
6:188:13659:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tional constraints on politicians both theoretically and empirically. We \frst highlight the main
6:189:13756:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:issues using a simple theoretical model. The model illustrates the non-monotonic relationship be-
6:190:13853:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tween constraints on power and the impact of reforms. It also highlights how e-ective reform may
6:191:13949:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sometimes lead to the deterioration of other (unreformed) policies a phenomenon which in pre-
6:192:14042:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vious work we called theseesaw e-ect(see also Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson and Thaicharoen,
6:193:14132:19:19:82:111:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2003).
6:194:14138:19:18:99:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then investigate the validity of these ideas by focusing on reforms related to central bank
6:195:14232:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:independence. CBI is a natural type of reform for us to study. Most other reforms, such as \fnancial
6:196:14332:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:liberalization, judicial reform, or removal of targeted subsidies, have relatively broad-mandates
6:197:14429:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and try to improve, among other things, the overall functioning of the economy, investment and
6:198:14523:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth. Instead, CBI has a much more clearly delineated target|in\ration. We can thus judge
6:199:14614:19:20:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the success of CBI by investigating whether or not it has reduced in\ration. Nevertheless, even
6:200:14709:20:11:82:543:164:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the \frst place. One obvious answer is that they are partly a response to external pressures. For example, J-acome
6:201:14823:11:11:82:543:153:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(2001) documents an IMF Technical Assistance mission to Zimbabwe on the reform of central bank laws in 1995.
6:202:14931:11:11:82:543:142:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:This perspective suggests that externally-imposed policy reforms might be less successful and e-ective than those
6:203:15044:11:7:82:211:131:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:generated by internal dynamics.
6:204:15075:7:15:95:543:124:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4In\ration increased in the UK in the 1970s and early 1980s, though never to hyperin\rationary levels. The desire
6:205:15188:15:11:82:543:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:to avoid the return of such episodes, as well as other bene\fts of CBI, for example, those related to credibility and
6:206:15305:11:11:82:543:98:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:transparency, might be some of the reasons why countries with relatively good policies still prefer to implement
6:207:15417:11:0:82:168:87:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:central bank reforms.
7:208:15439:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this investigation is complicated by the fact that countries often introduce CBI not as a stand-
7:209:15535:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:alone policy reform, but as part of a broader anti-in\ration package.5Throughout, we therefore
7:210:15629:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interpret the regression evidence on the implications of CBI as corresponding to the e-ects of this
7:211:15728:18:19:82:443:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broad anti-in\ration package that may include other reforms as well as CBI.
7:212:15803:19:19:99:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a non-monotonic
7:213:15894:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relationship between political constraints and the e-ectiveness of policy reform. We create an
7:214:15988:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index of the quality of general institutions by using constraints on the executive from Polity IV
7:215:16085:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data. Although the highly serially-correlated nature of data on in\ration makes statistical infer-
7:216:16183:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ence di-cult, the evidence is broadly consistent with a pattern in which CBI reduced in\ration in
7:217:16280:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries with intermediate levels of constraints on the executive, while it appears to have had
7:218:16376:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:no e-ect in societies with the strongest institutions. For countries with the weakest institutions
7:219:16474:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the general pattern is that there is no e-ect of CBI, though some speci\fcations show a statis-
7:220:16569:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tically signi\fcant, but generally non-robust, negative e-ect. Our empirical results rejected the
7:221:16666:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hypothesis that the e-ect of CBI is the same between high and medium-constraint countries, but
7:222:16760:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we are generally unable to reject the hypothesis that they are the same between medium and
7:223:16850:19:19:82:199:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:low-constraint countries.
7:224:16875:19:18:99:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, our approach and empirical results suggest that reforming economic institutions will
7:225:16968:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only be e-ective if the political context is right. If the context provides political constraints and
7:226:17069:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:accountability mechanisms so that there is a strong tendency to adopt good policies, there is
7:227:17162:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:little room for reforms to have major e-ects. If the context is bad, so that politics and policy
7:228:17258:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:making are highly nonrepresentative, reforms are likely to be irrelevant because they can easily
7:229:17354:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be undermined. It is in intermediate situations that reforms may have some bite: constraints are
7:230:17450:19:19:82:512:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weak enough to generate bad policy, but not so weak that all reforms can be undermined.
7:231:17537:19:18:99:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this light, our \fndings provide a di-erent interpretation to the apparent failure of various
7:232:17633:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms implemented throughout the 1990s and early 2000s than those argued by both the skeptics
7:233:17728:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the advocates of reform. Firstly, contrary to those who oppose reforms, it is not true that all
7:234:17827:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms have failed. In the case of CBI, which is our empirical focus in this paper, it appears that
7:235:17927:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy reform is associated with a signi\fcant decline in in\ration in societies with intermediate (and
7:236:18030:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sometimes low) levels of checks and constraints on politicians. Secondly, our results suggest that
7:237:18128:19:19:82:544:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even in places where reforms have failed, they havenotdone so because they are inappropriate from
7:238:18225:19:18:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an economic point of view. Rather, potentially sound economic reforms may often be politically
7:239:18319:18:16:82:523:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-viable in certain societies, at least if they do not take into account the political context.
7:240:18416:16:15:95:543:112:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5A clear example of this is the Argentinean case, where shortly before the introduction of CBI in 1992, a currency
7:241:18530:15:11:82:543:97:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:board pegged the exchange rate to the dollar. Figure 5 below also shows that in a number of countries in\ration
7:242:18641:11:0:82:320:86:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:starts declining a few years before the introduction of CBI.
8:243:18702:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that all of the evidence provided in this paper corre-
8:244:18794:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sponds to the conditional correlations in the data consistent with declines in in\ration at the same
8:245:18894:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time as or following central banking reforms. As we emphasize further below, policy reform in
8:246:18987:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:general and central bank reform in particular are endogenous and are also determined as part of
8:247:19082:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the political economy equilibrium in the society. Consequently, one should be cautious in reaching
8:248:19180:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strong conclusions on the basis of such evidence. Having said that, the fact that CBI is correlated
8:249:19279:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with contemporaneous and future declines in in\ration mostly in societies with intermediate levels
8:250:19377:18:19:82:529:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of constraints on politicians is intriguing and, at the very least, requires further investigation.
8:251:19476:19:19:99:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Following these basic \fndings we then investigate whether or not there is any evidence of a
8:252:19568:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seesaw e-ect following CBI. The seesaw e-ect suggests that when successful policy reform takes
8:253:19662:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:place in one dimension and the political equilibrium remains largely unchanged, politicians may
8:254:19757:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:try to use a di-erent instrument to attain the goal which was previously being targeted with
8:255:19849:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the reformed instrument. In general, the seesaw e-ect implies that as policy gets better in one
8:256:19944:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dimension, it may get worse in another. A natural candidate for the seesaw e-ect in the context of
8:257:20042:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI is \fscal policy. We therefore investigate whether or not \fscal policy changes signi\fcantly after
8:258:20145:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI is introduced. We provide some evidence that CBI is associated with greater government
8:259:20235:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expenditure as a percent of GDP in countries with intermediate constraints, while it is unrelated
8:260:20332:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to government expenditure in countries with low or high constraints. This evidence is consistent
8:261:20428:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with some worsening in other dimensions of policy in countries where CBI reform was e-ective
8:262:20520:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in reducing in\ration, though the e-ect of CBI on government expenditure is less robust than its
8:263:20616:18:19:82:176:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact on in\ration.
8:264:20636:19:19:99:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The recent economic history of Colombia and Argentina, depicted in Figure 2, illustrate the
8:265:20727:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seesaw e-ect. In both countries the introduction of CBI in 1991 was followed both by signi\fcant
8:266:20823:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:falls in in\ration and increases in government expenditures as a percent of GDP. In the Argentinean
8:267:20922:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case, as in many other countries in our sample, in\ration starts decreasing before central bank
8:268:21017:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform, which, as mentioned above, suggests that CBI is part of a broader package of reforms
8:269:21109:19:18:82:298:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aimed at controlling and stabilizing in\ration.
8:270:21156:18:19:99:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The pattern observed in Colombia has been linked to the political economy of redistribution
8:271:21247:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by scholars. Jaramillo, Steiner and Salazar (1999) and Carrasquilla (1999) noted that the increase
8:272:21345:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in in\ration in the early 1970s followed the contested presidential election of 1970 where it is widely
8:273:21448:19:18:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:believed that the dominant Liberal and Conservative parties, then operating the so-called `na-
8:274:21542:18:19:82:543:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tional front' and alternating in power, \fxed the results to defraud the true winner Gustavo Rojas
8:275:21640:19:19:82:543:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Pinilla, leader of the ANAPO party. Jaramillo, Steiner and Salazar (1997) claim that \seeking
8:276:21733:19:0:82:543:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for a broader base of supporters, the new government increased government expenditure.... As
9:277:21826:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aggregate demand kept increasing ... in\ration, that had remained in one digit \fgures for decades,
9:278:21925:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:accelerated" (p. 147). Clientelism during this period took the form not only of increased govern-
9:279:22022:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment expenditure \fnanced with seigniorage, but also involved the provision of cheap credit from
9:280:22118:18:19:82:479:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the central bank to various \frms and sectors (Cabrera and Ocampo, 1980, p. 136).
9:281:22199:19:19:99:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the post-CBI period, 1994 saw a political situation resembling the suspicions of fraud in
9:282:22291:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1970. It was discovered that the political campaign of the Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper,
9:283:22383:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who won the presidential election, had received large amounts of money from members of the Cali
9:284:22478:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drug cartel. A much discussed hypothesis is that in order to avoid impeachment by Congress,
9:285:22569:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:president Samper had to engage in intensive clientelism.  Though he may have done this in
9:286:22658:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erent ways, he was unable to use the same instruments as President Pastrana did in the
9:287:22747:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1970s since the central bank had become independent. As Reyes et. al. (1998, p. 11) point
9:288:22836:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:out \during 1995-96, under the new government of President Samper, instruments of monetary
9:289:22926:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and \fscal policy were in opposite directions, partly as a re\rection of the con\rict between the
9:290:23023:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Central Bank and the government: monetary policy becomes strongly contractionist... and \fscal
9:291:23117:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy becomes expansionist". Several commentators at the time claimed that the increase in
9:292:23208:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:government expenditure could be explained by the desire of Samper to remain in power (see, e.g.,
9:293:23304:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Sierra, 2004). This took the form of substantial wage increases to public employees (in particular
9:294:23402:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers, organized in a politically powerful union) between 1995 and 1998 (Echeverry, 2002).
9:295:23495:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Similarly, Davila Ladron de Guevara et. al. (2000) claim that military expenditure was more
9:296:23586:19:18:82:362:352:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:than doubled by Samper to gain the support of the army.6
9:297:23642:18:19:99:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the related literature
9:298:23738:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the political economy of reform, on the role of CBI in combating in\ration, and on possible
9:299:23832:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions between institutional factors and the e-ectiveness of policies. Section 3 presents a
9:300:23929:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:simple model illustrating why policy reform may be most in\ruential in societies with intermediate
9:301:24027:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:levels of political constraints. We also use this model to show how policy reform in one sphere can
9:302:24126:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lead to a deterioration of other dimensions of policy, creating a seesaw e-ect. Section 4 discusses
9:303:24225:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our data sources and the construction of the CBI variable. Section 5 presents our main empirical
9:304:24321:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results. These results suggest that, consistent with our theoretical expectations, CBI has little
9:305:24418:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect on in\ration in societies with the highest and the lowest constraints on politicians, but tends
9:306:24519:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reduce in\ration in countries with intermediate levels of constraints. Section 6 investigates the
9:307:24619:19:16:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seesaw e-ect, to see whether in societies where CBI reduces in\ration, there is any evidence of
9:308:24714:16:14:95:543:130:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:6The introduction of CBI coincided with the enactment of a new Constitution that mandated, among other
9:309:24816:14:11:82:543:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:things, larger transfers to the regions. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that the new Constitution is responsible for
9:310:24933:11:11:82:543:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the entire run-up in government expenditures. For example, Echeverry (2002) estimates that the spending items
9:311:25042:11:11:82:543:94:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:mandated by the Constitution could have explained at most 1/5 of the 20 percentage points increase in government
9:312:25154:11:0:82:266:83:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:expenditure share of GDP shown in Figure 2.
10:313:25198:0:35:82:327:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deterioration in other policies. Section 7 concludes.
10:314:25251:35:29:82:237:673:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2  Related Literature
10:315:25272:29:19:82:543:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our paper is related to two broad areas of research, one on the political economy of reform in
10:316:25366:19:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:general and the other on the consequences of central bank independence. We now give a brief
10:317:25457:19:29:82:385:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:overview of these literatures and how our \fndings add to them.
10:318:25520:29:26:82:283:577:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.1  Political Economy of Reform
10:319:25552:26:18:82:543:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a great deal of theoretical and case study work on the political economy of reform (see
10:320:25648:18:19:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rodrik, 1996, and Drazen, 2000, for overviews). Most of the theoretical research, for example,
10:321:25742:19:19:82:543:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Alesina and Drazen (1991) and Fernandez and Rodrik (1991), focuses on developing explanations
10:322:25835:19:18:82:543:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for why socially bene\fcial reforms do not occur or are delayed, though Mukand and Rodrik
10:323:25924:18:19:82:543:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005) develop a model where policymakers adopt reforms they know to be ine-cient to avoid
10:324:26014:19:19:82:543:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:being thought corrupt. Other work, taking political impediments to reform as given, discusses
10:325:26107:19:19:82:543:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the implications of these for the sequencing of reforms, whether or not gradual or radical reform
10:326:26204:19:18:82:543:420:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is desirable and whether or not reform can be sustained (for example Dewatripont and Roland,
10:327:26296:18:19:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1997). Most closely related to our paper are those by Shleifer and Vishny (1994) and Boycko,
10:328:26388:19:19:82:543:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Shleifer and Vishny (1996) who examine the circumstances when privatization increases e-ciency.
10:329:26483:19:18:82:543:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In their model politicians derive political bene\fts from high employment levels and even though
10:330:26579:18:19:82:543:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the managers of a privatized \frm may maximize pro\fts with less employment, politicians can bribe
10:331:26677:19:19:82:543:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:them to employ more people. They study the circumstances under which employment falls after
10:332:26768:19:19:82:543:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:privatization. Coate and Morris (2005), formalizing an intuition of Stigler (1971, 1972), develop
10:333:26865:19:18:82:543:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a model where policy reform can reduce e-ciency when politicians are initially using policy
10:334:26956:18:19:82:543:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:instruments to redistribute income in an optimal way. A key di-erence between our approach and
10:335:27050:19:19:82:543:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Coate and Morris's is our emphasis on the role of political institutions. More generally, none of
10:336:27147:19:18:82:543:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the papers mentioned above derive the non-monotonic relationship between reform and outcomes
10:337:27239:18:19:82:248:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is at the heart of our model.
10:338:27274:19:19:99:543:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At a general level, the entire empirical literature on the impact of policy and policy reforms on
10:339:27371:19:18:82:543:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economic variables|for example, on economic growth|provides relevant and useful background
10:340:27461:18:19:82:543:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to our work. The idea that policy reform might be desirable is implied from regressions showing
10:341:27556:19:19:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that variation in policies account for comparative growth.  Though there certainly are papers
10:342:27649:19:19:82:543:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arguing this, the cross-country literature is far from a consensus (see Easterly, 2005, for a review).
10:343:27751:19:18:82:543:102:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For instance, because policy variables exhibit multicollinearity, it is generally di-cult to \fnd
10:344:27848:18:0:82:543:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:robust relationships between particular policy measures and growth.  Moreover, the empirical
11:345:27941:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis in most of these papers is based on cross-section regressions and hence omitted variable
11:346:28038:19:19:82:248:689:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:bias may be a signi\fcant concern.7
11:347:28073:19:18:99:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Most of the empirical work on reform focuses on speci\fc instances of failed or successful reforms
11:348:28171:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(for example, Bates and Krueger, 1993). In terms of cross-national empirical work, Dollar and
11:349:28264:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Svensson (2000) show that political factors, particularly whether or not a country has a democratic
11:350:28363:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:government and how long the government has been in power, are important for the success of
11:351:28453:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:World Bank programs. In the related context of the e-ectiveness of international aid, Burnside
11:352:28547:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Dollar (2000) argued that aid increased growth when combined with good institutions and
11:353:28638:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies, though Easterly, Levine, and Roodman (2004) show that their results may not be robust.
11:354:28734:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The idea that the implications of policies or shocks depend on the institutional environment has
11:355:28830:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also appeared in other empirical papers.  For instance, Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2005)
11:356:28921:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Moene, Mehlum and Torvik (2006) show that the e-ect of natural resource abundance on
11:357:29009:19:19:82:471:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economic growth depends on the quality of the general institutions in the society.
11:358:29091:19:18:99:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our research is also related to the case study literature on Latin American politics which
11:359:29181:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has argued that the appearance and reality of policy reform in Latin America may be very
11:360:29269:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erent. Several scholars, notably Roberts (1995, 2008), Gibson (1997) and Levitsky (2003) have
11:361:29365:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:argued that the adoption of Washington consensus type reforms in Latin America went alongside
11:362:29458:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the continuation of populist policies and \politics as usual." The adoption of these reforms did
11:363:29554:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constrain which policies could be used, but politicians such as Menem in Argentina and Fujimori
11:364:29649:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Peru realized that even policy reform could be adjusted to \ft with the demands of clientelism|
11:365:29747:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for example, government owned \frms could be privatized, but sold relatively cheaply to those with
11:366:29845:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political connections. Populism and clientelism persisted even though the instruments that they
11:367:29940:19:29:82:438:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:used changed, an argument clearly related to those we make in this paper.

11:369:30057:26:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One of the most studied instances of policy reform is the introduction of CBI. Theoretical work in
11:370:30155:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the early 1980s, most notably Barro and Gordon (1983), argued that when unanticipated monetary
11:371:30249:18:19:82:543:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy can reduce the rate of unemployment, the government would be unable to commit to low
11:372:30340:19:19:82:543:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration and consequently in\ration would be sub-optimally high. Rogo- (1985) proposed that a
11:373:30434:19:18:82:543:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:solution to this problem was to delegate monetary policy to a \conservative central banker" and
11:374:30529:18:19:82:458:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thus established a theoretical rationale for creating independent central banks.
11:375:30609:19:16:99:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There have been a large number of empirical studies over the past 15 years examining the
11:376:30697:16:15:95:543:113:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7There is also convincing microeconomic evidence that some speci\fc types of reforms, like privatization, can
11:377:30806:15:11:82:543:98:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:have large bene\fcial e-ects.  See, for example, La Porta and Lopez-de-Silanes (1999) and Galiani, Gertler and

12:383:31315:19:31:82:456:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cross-sectional variation within OECD countries. Alesina and Summers report
12:384:31390:31:19:110:516:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\a near perfect negative correlation between in\ration and central bank independence"

12:386:31484:30:19:99:543:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This de jure index of CBI was further developed by Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti (1992)
12:387:31569:19:19:82:543:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and extended to 72 countries over the period 1950-1989 where possible (i.e. if the country is inde-
12:388:31668:19:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pendent). Using de jure indices and pooled time-series and cross-sectional regressions, Cukierman
12:389:31765:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et al. (1992) and Cukierman (1992) showed that the negative correlation between de jure CBI
12:390:31856:19:19:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and in\ration did not hold for a cross section of developing countries, though they con\frmed the
12:391:31953:19:18:82:543:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earlier negative correlation for developed countries. They also showed that their de facto index
12:392:32049:18:19:82:543:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of CBI (based on the turnover of governors) was positively correlated with in\ration in developing
12:393:32147:19:19:82:543:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries, but not signi\fcantly correlated with in\ration in developed countries. Various other
12:394:32243:19:19:82:543:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:papers, such as Guti-errez (2003) and Arnone, Laurens, Segalotto and Sommer (2007), report
12:395:32333:19:18:82:152:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar results.
12:396:32349:18:19:99:543:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, other studies \fnd very di-erent results. Using updated data, Crowe and Meade
12:397:32440:19:19:82:543:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2007) do not \fnd the same correlations. Campillo and Miron (1997) and Oatley (1999) argue
12:398:32531:19:18:82:543:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the correlation between de jure CBI and in\ration is not robust to the inclusion of various
12:399:32627:18:19:82:543:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covariates, such as measures of openness or the government de\fcit.  Oatley (1999), Mangano
12:400:32718:19:19:82:543:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1998), Forder (1998) and Banaian, Burdekin and Willett (1998) also document that the results
12:401:32811:19:19:82:501:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depend on the subjectively coded details of CBI measures and are not generally robust.
12:402:32897:19:18:99:543:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Keefer and Stasavage (2002, 2003), in a work related to our paper, argue that CBI will only
12:403:32988:18:19:82:543:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be e-ective if it cannot be reversed and this will only happen if there are checks and balances.
12:404:33084:19:19:82:543:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In their empirical work they interact a measure of checks and balances from Beck, Clarke, Gro-,
12:405:33179:19:18:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Keefer and Walsh (2001) with CBI and \fnd that introducing CBI increases in\ration unless checks
12:406:33275:18:19:82:543:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and balances are su-ciently high. Their work, like much of the rest of this literature, only exploits
12:407:33376:19:19:82:543:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cross-sectional variation. This strategy makes potential omitted variable bias quite severe, since
12:408:33474:19:18:82:543:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries that have introduced CBI typically have di-erent macroeconomic equilibria than the
12:409:33566:18:19:82:103:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rest.
12:410:33571:19:19:99:543:104:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In contrast to almost all of this literature, we focus on within-country variation. Though not a
12:411:33667:19:0:82:543:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:panacea against omitted variable biases, \fxed-e-ects panel data regressions provide more convinc-
13:412:33767:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing and more relevant conditional correlations, focusing on whether in\ration declines following
13:413:33863:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the introduction of CBI. Using such panel data regressions, we will show that the introduction
13:414:33957:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of CBI appears to be associated with declines in in\ration in countries with intermediate political
13:415:34056:18:35:82:515:652:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:constraints. The bene\fts of CBI in more developed economies appear to be more limited.8
13:416:34144:35:29:82:240:617:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3  Motivating Theory
13:417:34164:29:19:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we use a simple model to clarify our approach to the political economy of reform
13:418:34261:19:19:82:543:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and derive the hypotheses concerning the circumstances under which CBI should have a signi\fcant
13:419:34357:19:18:82:543:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact on in\ration. Our purpose is not to make a contribution to the theoretical literature on the
13:420:34456:18:19:82:543:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political economy of reform, but to highlight why speci\fc institutional reforms might have di-erent
13:421:34556:19:19:82:543:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects depending on the constraints facing politicians. For this purpose, we choose the simplest
13:422:34652:19:19:82:543:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model to communicate the major forces rather than strive for generality. Our model is a simpli\fed
13:423:34750:19:18:82:543:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:version of|and a slight variant on|Grossman and Helpman's (1994) model of lobbying. A single
13:424:34842:18:19:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:organized lobby will try to convince a politician to choose distortionary policies.  Underlying
13:425:34937:19:19:82:543:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints and reform of speci\fc institutions relating to this policy (\policy reform") might place
13:426:35038:19:18:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:limits on the in\ruence of the lobby on the politician and on policy choices. We \frst use this model
13:427:35139:18:19:82:543:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to highlight the interactions between policy reform and constraints on politicians. We then use a
13:428:35236:19:19:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:simple extension of the model to show how successful policy reform in one sphere can lead to a
13:429:35330:19:19:82:390:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deterioration of other dimensions of policy (the \seesaw e-ect").
13:430:35395:19:18:99:543:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our framework is chosen both for its simplicity and to emphasize the commonalities between
13:431:35485:18:19:82:543:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI and other types of policy reform and does not do justice to some aspects of the macroeconomic
13:432:35582:19:19:82:543:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equilibrium leading to high in\ration. For example, the time-inconsistency problems emphasized
13:433:35676:19:18:82:543:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by Barro and Gordon (1983) and Rogo- (1985) are absent. We provide some justi\fcation for
13:434:35765:18:19:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:why we think these time-inconsistency problems are not \frst-order in the context of high in\ration
13:435:35864:19:19:82:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in developing countries. Moreover, the war-of-attrition aspect of the con\rict over policy reform
13:436:35961:19:19:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:emphasized by Alesina and Drazen (1991) is also absent in our setup. Although one could develop
13:437:36056:19:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same general insights using a war-of-attrition model, we prefer to use the simplest model to
13:438:36152:18:16:82:504:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highlight the basic political economy factors a-ecting the e-ectiveness of policy reforms.
13:439:36242:16:15:95:543:179:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:8This does not imply that CBI has no bene\ft in relatively developed countries. Given the lower levels of in\ration
13:440:36357:15:11:82:543:164:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in OECD economies, the e-ect of CBI will be harder to detect, particularly if it is small. Moreover, CBI might create
13:441:36474:11:11:82:543:153:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:other bene\fts by introducing transparency and creating insurance against possible future relaxations of monetary
13:442:36587:11:0:82:108:142:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:policy.
14:443:36596:0:26:82:253:708:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.1  Model and Main Result
14:444:36622:26:19:82:543:682:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The economy consists of three actors, a politician, citizens and an organized group. There is a
14:445:36717:19:18:82:544:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:single policy variable-2R+. This policy can be thought of as in\ration to make the transition
14:446:36810:18:19:82:543:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the empirical work easier, though nothing in this section depends on this interpretation. In

14:448:36991:19:19:82:543:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been policy reform and also parameterizes the intensity of reform (see below). A large group of
14:449:37086:19:18:82:236:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:citizens has preferences given by

14:452:37227:18:19:82:543:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the citizens (i.e., their most preferred policy) is-= 0 (since--0 by assumption), and any

14:454:37411:19:18:82:543:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\distortionary policy". We could also makeudirectly depend on whether there has been policy

14:464:38214:19:18:82:543:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the citizens, for example, because any deviation from the policies preferred by the citizens will

14:466:38409:19:19:82:543:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the politician's behavior, for example, because he is not accountable to the citizens or because
14:467:38505:19:18:82:543:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:he is di-cult to replace using elections or other means. In this case, he can pursue policies that
14:468:38603:18:19:82:543:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase the transfers he receives with impunity. The other important feature of the preferences

14:470:38794:19:19:82:543:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies more costly for the politician (for example, providing credit to favored \frms or groups,
14:471:38892:19:18:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or in\rationary policies to gain support become more di-cult and costly). All else equal, this will
14:472:38991:18:16:82:543:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discourage the use of distortionary policies by the politician. Making the use of such policies more
14:473:39091:16:15:95:543:114:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:9In a richer model, it is possible that high constraints might make lobbies more powerful, because a \well-
14:474:39198:15:11:82:543:99:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:meaning" politician may be unable to act decisively to reduce in\ration.  Though possible, we believe that this
14:475:39309:11:0:82:398:88:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:consideration is second-order since well-meaning politicians are relatively rare.
15:476:39392:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costly for the politician is not the only way to model the e-ects of policy reform.10An alternative
15:477:39491:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would be to model policy reform as introducing a hard constraint, for example, as imposing that
15:478:39586:19:18:82:544:670:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:----for some upper bound on policy --. This is not a useful modeling strategy for understanding
15:479:39681:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy reform in societies with weak institutions, because, with such hard constraints, there would
15:480:39780:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be no room for pursuing distortionary policies after the reform, whereas our focus is on whether
15:481:39876:19:19:82:389:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform will prevent the implementation of distortionary policies.

15:489:40162:19:19:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nience, and the fact that these preferences do not directly depend on-is also for simplicity. These
15:490:40261:19:19:82:543:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumptions also have no e-ect on the qualitative results. These preferences immediately imply
15:491:40355:19:28:82:264:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the lobby's political bliss point is

15:496:40405:28:19:82:543:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thus the lobby will try to shift policy towards higher levels of-than those preferred by the
15:497:40497:19:18:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:citizens.  The only instrument that the lobby has available for this purpose is the transfer to
15:498:40592:18:19:82:543:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the politician,t. Examples of policies for which citizens and lobbies have con\ricting preferences
15:499:40690:19:19:82:543:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include industrial policy, tari-s and agricultural subsidies. In\ration is another potential example,
15:500:40791:19:19:82:543:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:since it is often used as a means of generating funds (e.g., through the in\ration tax) for redis-
15:501:40889:19:18:82:543:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tributing to politically-powerful groups, such as public-sector employees or companies receiving
15:502:40985:18:19:82:543:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:procurements or industrial subsidies, at the expense of the citizens at large, or results from the
15:503:41083:19:19:82:289:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:use of government credits for favored \frms.
15:504:41127:19:18:99:543:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although there are three actors, citizens are passive and the main interactions are between
15:505:41218:18:30:82:372:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the lobby and the politician. We model this game as follows:
15:506:41278:30:27:99:365:223:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:-The parameter-and the reform variable-are given.
15:507:41327:27:0:99:234:196:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:-The lobby makes an o-er

15:509:41352:9:0:243:258:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:^-;^t
15:510:41357:0:9:258:263:205:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:-
15:511:41358:9:19:267:543:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the politician. As in Grossman and Helpman's (1994)
15:512:41412:19:15:110:543:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model, this implies that if the politician accepts the transfer^t, he has to implement policy
15:513:41505:15:15:91:543:162:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10Yet another alternative, which in fact gives even more stark results, is to assume that these reforms act as
15:514:41615:15:11:82:543:147:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f6:costly commitment devices, and thus assume that they make distortionary policies more costly for the citizens. In
15:515:41728:11:11:82:543:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:this case, policy reform would discourage distortionary policies by increasing the costs that these policies impose
15:516:41843:11:11:82:543:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:on the society, and indirectly on the politician. In the context of CBI, for example, high in\ration becomes both
15:517:41956:11:11:82:543:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:more costly to society and also potentially more costly to implement for the government (both because it will
15:518:42065:11:11:82:543:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:destroy the bene\fcial reputation that monetary policy may have established and also because workers' and \frms'
15:519:42177:11:11:82:543:92:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:behavior would have been shaped by expectations of low in\ration). The assumption used in the text may have
15:520:42284:11:0:82:271:81:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:wider applicability, motivating our choice here.
16:521:42334:0:19:110:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:^-.  This is presumably supported by a continuation game in which there are repeated
16:522:42418:19:27:110:544:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions, but as in much of the literature, we do not model these to simplify the analysis.
16:523:42513:27:18:99:543:662:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:-The politician chooses policy ~-.  If ~-= ^-, then the politician also receives transfer^t.

16:525:42632:28:19:99:543:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This is a simple game and we characterize its subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). As usual,
16:526:42722:19:19:82:543:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this is done by backward induction.  In the last stage of the game, the politician will choose
16:527:42816:19:18:82:543:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whichever policy maximizes his utility. Clearly, this will be either ~-= ^-, so that he can receive
16:528:42915:18:19:82:543:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the transfer^t, obtaining a utility of-u(^-) + (1--)^t--^-, or ~-= 0, in which case he will receive
16:529:43014:19:19:82:282:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:zero transfers and a utility level of-u(0).

17:584:44744:19:19:82:543:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result suggests that when these checks are su-ciently strong, the political system will generate
17:585:44840:19:19:82:543:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a policy choice that is not distortionary, regardless of whether there has been reform or not. In
17:586:44937:19:18:82:543:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:terms of our empirical work below, this result suggests that in societies where there are signi\fcant
17:587:45038:18:19:82:543:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints on politicians, reforms should have relatively small e-ects. This can be understood
17:588:45133:19:19:82:543:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by considering the example of in\ration. Consequently, though CBI might limit in\ration in well-
17:589:45229:19:18:82:543:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:governed societies, we would not expect a very large decline in in\ration as a result of central bank
17:590:45330:18:19:82:529:509:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform, since these societies would not have chosen highly distortionary policies to start with.
17:591:45426:19:19:99:543:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:More generally, the solution to the lobby's maximization problem in (6), and thus the (subgame
17:592:45520:19:29:82:306:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:perfect) equilibrium level of policy, is given by:

17:605:45600:30:19:99:544:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This equation shows that the sensitivity of equilibrium policy ~-to-(policy reform) will be
17:606:45691:19:19:82:543:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:limited when-is low. Intuitively, when there are no checks on the politician in power, he will
17:607:45785:19:18:82:543:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do whatever maximizes his utility, and this will involve maximizing the transfers he receives.
17:608:45879:18:19:82:543:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Consequently, transfers can outweigh the costs that policy reform imposes on the politician's use
17:609:45976:19:19:82:543:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of distortionary policies. In terms of the in\ration example, the politician in power can put pressure
17:610:46078:19:18:82:543:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or use other means to force the central bank to increase the money supply and in\ration, even
17:611:46171:18:19:82:543:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if choosing high in\ration might have become more di-cult or costly.12Interpreted di-erently,
17:612:46264:19:19:82:543:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:equation (7) suggests that in societies with low-,de jurereform may not translate intode facto
17:613:46358:19:18:82:543:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform, because despite the greater cost of-to the politician, the political equilibrium will induce
17:614:46458:18:19:82:382:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:him to choose policies not so di-erent from the pre-reform era.
17:615:46521:19:31:99:335:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The following result now readily follows from (7):

17:622:46742:18:14:110:144:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform.
17:623:46749:14:15:91:543:143:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12This will also be true when in\ration or other distortionary policies also become more costly for the society as a
17:624:46865:15:11:82:543:128:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:whole after reform. For example, in\ration might be disastrous for the future of the economy and ruin the potential
17:625:46980:11:11:82:543:117:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:bene\fts that might have resulted from credibly establishing the independence of the central bank (and this can
17:626:47091:11:11:82:543:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:be incorporated by including--in the utility function of the citizens), but when-is low, this will still not deter
17:627:47205:11:0:82:259:95:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:politicians from using distortionary policies.
18:628:47253:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This result therefore implies that when constraints are not so high as to have avoided the use
18:629:47347:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of distortionary policies in the \frst place, policy reform might be e-ective. However, how e-ective
18:630:47447:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it will be is a function of the constraints on the politician. The greater is-, the more transfers
18:631:47545:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are necessary for the politician to adopt the distortionary policy after reform and thus the lower
18:632:47643:19:19:82:378:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will be the equilibrium distortionary policies following reform.
18:633:47707:19:31:99:329:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Putting these two results together, we conclude:
18:634:47755:31:18:82:543:583:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f2:Result 3Policy reform will have the largest e-ect on distortionary policies in societies with
18:635:47848:18:19:110:544:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate levels of constraints on politicians, and it will have no e-ect or only limited
18:636:47940:19:31:110:449:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects in societies with the highest and the lowest levels of constraints.
18:637:48014:31:18:99:543:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the empirical work that follows, we investigate whether the e-ects of CBI reforms on
18:638:48101:18:30:82:349:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration are consistent with the predictions in Result 3.
18:639:48159:30:25:82:220:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.2  The Seesaw E-ect
18:640:48180:25:19:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now use the model from the previous subsection to illustrate the \seesaw e-ect," whereby
18:641:48271:19:19:82:543:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:successful policy reform might lead to a deterioration in other dimensions of policy. To do this,
18:642:48368:19:18:82:543:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:let us augment the previous model with another policy dimension, denoted by-2R+, and modify
18:643:48459:18:19:82:182:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:citizen preferences to
18:644:48481:19:25:263:362:367:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:u(-;-) =-----0-;
18:645:48497:25:19:82:543:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where-0is also a strictly positive constant. This implies that-is another distortionary policy
18:646:48591:19:19:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and thus the political bliss point of the citizens now corresponds to (-;-) = (0;0). It is important
18:647:48691:19:18:82:543:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to note that, in this instance, policy reform is narrowly targeted at-, and thus only makes
18:648:48782:18:19:82:543:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy-more costly for the politician. Some reforms, which involve the introduction of greater
18:649:48876:19:19:82:543:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:accountability on politicians, would not \ft this pattern. CBI reform is a natural candidate in this
18:650:48976:19:19:82:428:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:context, since it is primarily focused with monetary policy and in\ration.
18:651:49050:19:29:99:311:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The preferences of the lobby are modi\fed to

19:687:49630:28:19:82:543:574:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This assumption implies that policy-is more costly for the citizens and less bene\fcial for the

19:689:49796:29:30:82:533:526:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f2:Result 4Suppose (9) holds and there has been no policy reform, that is,-= 0. Then,~-= 0.
19:690:49884:30:19:99:543:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, it is more economical for the lobby to receive policy favors through-, which is
19:691:49976:19:18:82:543:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both more bene\fcial for the lobby and less costly for the citizens. Consequently, policy-will

19:693:50158:19:19:82:543:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the simplifying assumptions made in this subsection; in particular, it depends on the assumption
19:694:50254:19:18:82:543:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the two policies,-and-, are perfect substitutes. Without this assumption, both policies
19:695:50346:18:19:82:543:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might be used simultaneously before policy reform. Nevertheless, our main result, Result 5, would
19:696:50443:19:19:82:418:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continue to apply even when these policies are not perfect substitutes.
19:697:50514:19:18:99:543:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, suppose, that policy reform is enacted, so that-=-R>0. Our main result in this
19:698:50598:18:19:82:543:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsection is that, following such policy reform, it may become bene\fcial to use the alternative

19:723:51003:32:19:99:543:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This result follows readily from the maximization problem (8), combined with (9) and (10).
19:724:51093:19:19:82:543:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note that (9) and (10) are consistent with each other provided that-Ris su-ciently large|
19:725:51182:19:0:82:543:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:meaning that reforms is e-ective in making policy-costly. Result 4 implies that before policy
20:726:51277:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform the equilibrium involved~-= 0. Moreover, given (9) and (10), before policy reform the
20:727:51369:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equilibrium involves ~->0.  Consequently, policy reform in this case creates a typical seesaw
20:728:51462:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pattern; the policy that is regulated with the reform goes down (we go from ~->0 to ~-0= 0),
20:729:51554:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but at the same time the political process generates rents for the still-powerful lobby by using an
20:730:51653:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:alternative policy instrument more intensively (we go from~-= 0 to~-0>0). This result highlights
20:731:51749:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that when the political-economic interactions leading to distortionary policies remain unchanged,
20:732:51846:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the imposition of a (speci\fc or narrowly-targeted) policy reform might only change the form
20:733:51938:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of redistribution towards politically powerful groups|rather than eliminate policy distortions
20:734:52032:19:19:82:120:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entirely.
20:735:52041:19:18:99:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An interesting implication of the speci\fc con\fguration of parameters given by (9) and (10)
20:736:52133:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should also be noted: in the case discussed in Result 5, policy reform makes both citizens and
20:737:52227:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the lobby worse-o-. Instead of the less costly instrument, now redistribution takes place with
20:738:52321:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the more costly instrument. This is not a general result and policy reform might improve the
20:739:52413:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allocation of resources despite the presence of seesaw-like e-ects. Nevertheless, this result points
20:740:52513:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:out the potential pitfalls of speci\fc policy reforms in societies where constraints on politicians are
20:741:52616:19:29:82:458:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:absent and political-economic interactions lead to dysfunctional policy choices.
20:742:52696:29:26:82:225:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.3  General Discussion
20:743:52719:26:19:82:543:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The model we have developed here is in the spirit of standard approaches to redistributive politics.
20:744:52819:19:18:82:543:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In particular, as noted above, it does not include any element of time inconsistency. We do not
20:745:52914:18:19:82:543:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:believe that time-inconsistency issues play a major role in understanding high in\ration or hyper-
20:746:53012:19:19:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\rationary episodes in less-developed economies. Most instances of high in\ration are directly
20:747:53108:19:18:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:related to the inability of governments to fund their (often politically-motivated) expenditures
20:748:53204:18:19:82:543:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through taxation and borrowing. Such policies are much more likely to emerge when there is se-
20:749:53298:19:19:82:543:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vere distributional con\rict that the political system is unable to resolve or when politicians have
20:750:53398:19:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only limited instruments to use to distribute patronage. The increasing in\ration in Zimbabwe,
20:751:53492:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depicted in Figure 1, is an example of this; President Mugabe turned to hyperin\ration when he
20:752:53586:18:19:82:542:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had no further resources left to redistribute patronage to the military and to his key supporters.
20:753:53684:19:19:99:543:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we should also note that though we followed Grossman and Helpman (1994) in setting
20:754:53775:19:18:82:543:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:up the model with lobbies making o-ers to politicians, the model could be reformulated to allow
20:755:53870:18:19:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians to make o-ers to interest groups without a-ecting any of the results. This reformulation
20:756:53970:19:19:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might be more in line with the political experiences of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Latin
20:757:54066:19:19:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:America, where interest groups are as likely to be captured by politicians as politicians are likely
20:758:54166:19:0:82:543:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to be captured by interest groups (see Acemoglu, Robinson and Verdier, 2003, for a discussion).
21:759:54263:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For instance, in his seminal study of economic policy in Ghana, Killick (1978, p.  35) notes
21:760:54355:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that president \Nkrumah succeeded in capturing the lobbies; in making them dependent on him
21:761:54446:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:instead of himself on them". The example of Argentina under Per\u0013on also illustrates the same
21:762:54543:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pattern (see, e.g., Collier and Collier, 1991).  First as minister of labor and then president in
21:763:54640:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 1940s, Per-on played an active role in creating the interest groups which then constituted his
21:764:54738:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support base. Certain groups in society will have (political) resources that politicians need and
21:765:54835:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians will o-er them redistribution in exchange for this support. The model above could be
21:766:54931:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reformulated along these lines and policy reform would now represent an increase in the cost to
21:767:55026:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the politicians in supplying policy favors to interest groups, possibly because they now have to
21:768:55122:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:use patronage to also control those who run the independent central bank. Our major results, in
21:769:55217:18:35:82:439:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular Results 3 and 5, would continue to apply in this modi\fed setup.
21:770:55292:35:29:82:328:486:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:4  Data Sources and Construction
21:771:55324:29:19:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Throughout the paper we focus on the \post-Bretton Woods" period 1972-2005.13Between 1946
21:772:55413:19:19:82:543:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 1971 countries under the Bretton Woods system agreed to coordinate monetary policy in
21:773:55502:19:18:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:order to \fx their currencies with respect to gold. This naturally limited the discretion that both
21:774:55601:18:19:82:543:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:governments and central banks had in managing their monetary policies. This implies that the
21:775:55693:19:19:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:post-Bretton Woods era is a natural period for us to focus on in the analysis of the relationship
21:776:55790:19:19:82:211:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between CBI and in\ration.
21:777:55816:19:18:99:543:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Several approaches have been used to measure CBI and there is some controversy over the
21:778:55903:18:19:82:543:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:advantages and disadvantages of di-erent approaches (see Arnone, Laurens and Segalotto, 2006,
21:779:55996:19:19:82:544:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:for a comprehensive overview).  The key question centers around whether one should usede
21:780:56084:19:18:82:543:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:juremeasures, which capture how much independence the central bank has in law, orde facto
21:781:56173:18:19:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures, which correspond to how much independence the central bank has in practice. Another
21:782:56266:19:19:82:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distinction which has been made is whether or not the central bank has \goal independence," in
21:783:56360:19:19:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sense of being able to determine its owns objectives, or \operational independence," where it
21:784:56457:19:18:82:495:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may not set its own goal but has freedom to achieve any goal set without interference.
21:785:56543:18:19:99:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Grilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini (GMT) developed an index based on Aufricht (1967), em-
21:786:56631:19:19:82:543:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:phasizing political independence, as measured by the procedures regarding the appointment of
21:787:56723:19:18:82:543:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the central bank board, the relationship between the bank and the government in the formulation
21:788:56818:18:19:82:543:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of monetary policy, and the formal responsibilities of the central bank. They also measured \eco-
21:789:56915:19:16:82:543:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nomic independence," which focuses on whether or not the central bank must \fnance government
21:790:57008:16:15:91:543:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:13The Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971 when the United States suspended the convertibility of dollars to
21:791:57118:15:0:82:101:89:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:gold.
22:792:57125:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debt. The current state of the art of the measurement of de jure CBI stems from Cukierman
22:793:57214:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(CUK) (1992) and Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti (1992). Cukierman and his collaborators con-
22:794:57303:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:structed an index of de jure CBI for 72 countries over the period 1950-1989 coding the variable
22:795:57398:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for 4 ten-year periods with the index being constant within the period. They used 16 di-erent
22:796:57491:19:19:82:329:633:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:characteristics in the index with di-erent weights.14
22:797:57544:19:19:99:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Each of the above indices has various drawbacks. Mangano (1998) argues that there is signif-
22:798:57636:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:icant subjectivity both in the criteria included in the di-erent indices and in the interpretation
22:799:57734:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of laws and legislature.15It appears that these indices are not capturing onlyde jureCBI, but
22:800:57827:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are, at least in part, informative about how monetary policy is being conducted in practice. The
22:801:57923:19:18:82:544:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:focus on policy reform makes it important that we focus onde jureCBI. A related problem
22:802:58010:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is that most existing work reports values for CBI indices computed at a speci\fc point in time.
22:803:58105:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, within-country variation is essential for our empirical strategy (for panel \fxed-e-ect
22:804:58201:19:19:82:149:483:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:regressions).16
22:805:58216:19:18:99:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to overcome these problems, we measurede jureCBI by a dummy variable that takes
22:806:58304:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a value of 1 in every year after a major reform to the constitution or central bank law leading
22:807:58399:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to increased independence, and zero elsewhere. The advantage of this measure is that it does
22:808:58491:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not incorporate information on thede factoconduct of monetary policy. A drawback is that this
22:809:58584:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure assumes CBI increases by the same magnitude in every country following a reform (which
22:810:58678:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we know is not true as reforms in di-erent countries introduced di-erent levels of independence).
22:811:58775:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Nevertheless, it captures in a simple way the e-ect of central bank reform and changes inde jure
22:812:58871:18:14:82:105:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI.
22:813:58875:14:15:91:543:320:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14For instance, 8 characteristics were used to judge the extent of limitations on central bank lending to the
22:814:58984:15:11:82:543:305:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:government and these collectively received half of the weight in the index. Four legal characteristics which concerned
22:815:59102:11:11:82:543:294:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the way governors were appointed or dismissed were given 1/5th of the weight and three other characteristics which

22:817:59320:7:15:91:543:276:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15In particular, from a comparison of the CUK and GMT indices Mangano concludes that \...  [there is] a
22:818:59423:15:11:82:543:261:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:signi\fcant degree of inconsistency between the two indices' valuation of their common criteria. Only in one country
22:819:59539:11:11:82:543:250:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(out of 17) and in the case of one criterion (out of 9) have CUK and GMT translated the legislation in exactly
22:820:59649:11:11:82:543:239:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the same way: their interpretation of the laws governing the Italian CB, and of the regulations concerning the
22:821:59759:11:11:82:543:228:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:CB Governors' terms of o-ce in the countries sampled, exhibit no divergence. On the other hand, their average
22:822:59868:11:11:82:543:217:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:interpretation spread when examining Danish, French, Greek, and Japanese legislation is close to 50%, and they
22:823:59978:11:11:82:543:206:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:disagree in nearly 60% of countries when deciding whether the CB is legally allowed to purchase government debt in
22:824:60092:11:11:82:543:195:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the primary market or not. Overall, it appears that in the 17 countries included in both CUK's and GMT's samples,
22:825:60205:11:11:82:543:184:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:virtually a third of the values attributed to their nine common criteria are subject to non-negligible interpretation
22:826:60322:11:7:82:183:173:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:problems" (pp. 476-477).
22:827:60346:7:15:91:543:166:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:16Exceptions that construct and use time-varying indices are: Polillo and Guillen (2005), who provide values of
22:828:60457:15:10:82:543:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the Cukierman index for the period 1989-2000 for a sample of 90 countries; J-acome and Vasquez (2005) for Latin
22:829:60568:10:11:82:543:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:America; Cukierman, Miller and Neyapti (2002) for former Soviet countries; Arnone, Laurens, Segalotto and Somer
22:830:60679:11:11:82:527:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(2007) for a sample of emerging market countries; and Crowe and Meade (2007) for a sample of 102 countries.
22:831:60786:11:11:92:544:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Both Arnone et.al (2007) and Crowe and Meade (2007) explore time-series variation in these indices by taking
22:832:60894:11:11:82:543:108:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:values of them at two points in time (late 1980s and early 21st century) and assume the change from one value to
22:833:61006:11:0:82:355:97:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:another occurs in the year in which central bank reform took place.
23:834:61075:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main sample consists of 52 countries for which information on changes in their central
23:835:61165:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bank legislation was reported by J-acome and Vasquez (2005) and Polillo and Guill-en (2005). We
23:836:61260:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exclude all former socialist countries since there is limited data for these countries before CBI
23:837:61357:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and they enact CBI at the same time as many other reforms associated to the transition from
23:838:61448:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:planned to market economies. We also exclude Africa since central bank reforms in these countries
23:839:61545:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are harder to determine and interpret, and in most cases, the reforms fell short of creating truly
23:840:61643:19:18:82:219:595:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:independent central banks.17
23:841:61671:18:19:99:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our sample includes almost every OECD and Latin American country and covers a sample
23:842:61755:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of 12 Asian countries (see Appendix Table A1). To construct our CBI dummy for Latin Ameri-
23:843:61845:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can countries we used the dates of major central bank reforms provided by Jacome and Vasquez
23:844:61937:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005). For the remaining countries, the CBI dummy takes a value equal to one starting in the
23:845:62030:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year in which the Cukierman index constructed by Polillo and Guill-en (2005) increases. Moreover,
23:846:62127:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for every country we used Arnone, Laurens, Segalotto and Somer (2007), who provided the year
23:847:62219:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of major central bank reforms, to verify that a major reform did take place in the year in which
23:848:62315:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the index constructed by Polillo and Guill-en (2005) increases. Whenever there was disagreement
23:849:62410:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between Polillo and Guill-en (2005) and Arnone, Laurens, Segalotto and Somer (2007), we con-
23:850:62502:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sulted additional sources (such as the central bank's website) in order to identify the year in which
23:851:62603:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the most substantial reform towards CBI (if any) took place. Similarly, for countries for which
23:852:62698:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the index constructed by Polillo and Guill-en (2005) did not increase between 1989 and 2000 we
23:853:62792:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:used Arnone, Laurens, Segalotto and Somer (2007) and other sources to explore if a central bank
23:854:62887:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform took place after 2000. The countries included in our sample and the details of the coding,
23:855:62984:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:including the laws that amended central bank charters as well as additional sources used can be
23:856:63079:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:found in Appendix Table A1. As is evident from the table, most central bank reforms in these
23:857:63171:19:18:82:264:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries took place during the 1990s.
23:858:63209:18:19:99:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to this sample we also examined the impact of CBI on the 40 of these 52 countries
23:859:63302:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that changed their CBI over our sample period. Focusing on this sample enables us to obtain
23:860:63393:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identi\fcation from di-erences in the timing of CBI; the countries in this sample might also be
23:861:63488:18:19:82:433:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more homogeneous since they have all undergone the same policy reform.
23:862:63558:19:19:99:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Though we believe our CBI dummy is a transparent way of investigating the relationship
23:863:63644:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between CBI and in\ration, we also study the robustness of our results by using the Cukierman
23:864:63737:19:18:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index.  Since these data are not in the form of an annual time series and earlier data exhibit
23:865:63831:18:14:82:543:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:almost no variation we take the value of the index in 1989 and assume that this value holds for
23:866:63926:14:15:91:543:114:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17For example, the Cukierman index of central bank independence reported by Polillo and Guillen (2005) is
23:867:64031:15:11:82:543:99:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:very low for most African countries and reforms to the central bank charters during the nineties caused very small
23:868:64145:11:0:82:185:88:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:increases in these indices.
24:869:64174:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all pre CBI periods. We then use the 2003 value from Crowe and Meade (2007) for all post CBI
24:870:64266:19:19:82:120:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:periods.
24:871:64274:19:18:99:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main measure of political institutions is constraints on the executive from the Polity IV
24:872:64367:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dataset, which codes the extent of constitutional limits on the exercise of arbitrary power by the
24:873:64465:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive. The Polity dataset reports a qualitative score, between 1 and 7, for every independent
24:874:64562:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:country. We computed the average of the constraints on the executive variable for the period
24:875:64654:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1972-2004, and then classi\fed each country in our sample into low, medium and high constraints
24:876:64749:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the executive categories.18Countries within one-standard deviation from the sample mean (of
24:877:64843:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the average constraints on executive) were assigned to the medium-constraint category, while the
24:878:64939:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rest were assigned to high-constraint and low-constraint groups. The histogram in Figure 3 shows
24:879:65035:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the distribution of average constraints on the executive for our sample as well as the cuto-s for the
24:880:65136:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erent categories. Appendix Table A2 shows the category in which each country was classi\fed.
24:881:65231:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The low and medium constraints on the executive categories are composed mainly of Asian and
24:882:65322:19:18:82:515:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Latin American countries, while most OECD countries are in the high-constraint category.
24:883:65410:18:19:99:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To check that our results are not driven by the speci\fc cuto-s used in creating the low, medium
24:884:65506:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and high groups, we also look at the interaction of a quadratic function of the average constraints
24:885:65605:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the executive with the CBI dummy. We show that the results using this approach are similar
24:886:65698:18:19:82:449:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to those estimated using the dummies for low, medium and high constraints.
24:887:65772:19:19:99:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition, we also check the robustness of our results by using di-erent measures of institu-
24:888:65867:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tions. In particular, we use the rule of law and the control of corruption indices constructed by
24:889:65964:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi (2007) for the period 1996-2005.19These indices are reported
24:890:66054:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on a scale from -2.5 to 2.5 and are based on subjective perceptions by public sector, private sec-
24:891:66152:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tor and NGO experts.20The classi\fcation of countries based on these variables, following the
24:892:66245:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same one standard deviation rule described above, is reported in Appendix Table A2. Overall,
24:893:66337:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the classi\fcation under the three institutional variables is similar. The most notable exception is
24:894:66437:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Singapore, which is classi\fed as a low-institutions country under constraints on the executive but
24:895:66536:19:15:82:515:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as a high-institutions country under both the rule of law and control of corruption indices.
24:896:66628:15:15:91:543:206:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:18We use the average of constraints on the executive over 1972-2004 rather than its value at the beggining of
24:897:66737:15:11:82:543:191:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the period or its year-to-year variation because the average value of this variable appears to provide a better and
24:898:66852:11:11:82:543:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:less noisy measure of how constrained politicians are in a given country. The changes in this variable from year to
24:899:66967:11:11:82:543:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:year are subject to potential miscodings, which are averaged out when we considered the average constraints on
24:900:67077:11:7:82:270:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the executive over a reasonable period of time.
24:901:67124:7:15:91:543:151:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:19One advantage of these indices is that they measure institutional quality around the time of central bank
24:902:67231:15:7:82:215:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:independence for most countries.
24:903:67263:7:15:91:543:129:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:20The exact questions for the two variables are: \the extent to which agents have con\fdence in and abide by
24:904:67371:15:11:82:543:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police, and the courts, as well as the
24:905:67490:11:11:82:543:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:likelihood of crime and violence" and \the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both
24:906:67607:11:11:82:543:92:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as `capture' of the state by elites and private interests" (Kaufmann
24:907:67720:11:0:82:154:81:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:et.al., 2007, p. 4).
25:908:67742:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our main dependent variable, in\ration, was obtained from the International Financial Sta-
25:909:67832:19:19:82:542:689:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:tistics (IMF) and corresponds to the annual percentage variation of the consumer price index.21
25:910:67927:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figures 4, 5 and 6 plot the in\ration data over time as well as the date of CBI (indicated by a verti-
25:911:68029:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cal line) for all the countries in our sample. Figure 4 looks at the 8 countries in the low constraints
25:912:68132:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the executive category, Figure 5 looks at medium-constraint countries, while Figure 6 exam-
25:913:68226:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ines the countries with high levels of constraints. In order to isolate changes in individual country
25:914:68327:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration rates, throughout these \fgures the average normalized world in\ration is subtracted from
25:915:68426:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:each country's normalized in\ration rate (so that the horizontal line at zero indicates when the
25:916:68522:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration rate of the country is at the world average).22Figure 4 suggests that there appears to
25:917:68618:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be a mixed association between in\ration and CBI in countries with the weakest constraints. In
25:918:68712:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:China and Guyana, there is a decline in in\ration following the introduction of the CBI, whereas
25:919:68808:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Guatemala or Nepal, in\ration drifts upward over time and the introduction of CBI in 2002
25:920:68900:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in both countries appears to have had no e-ect on this process. Figure 5 shows several cases
25:921:68992:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where there are signi\fcant disin\rations concurrent with the introduction of CBI. This happens in
25:922:69090:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombia and Argentina, as we already discussed in the Introduction, but it also seems to occur
25:923:69185:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Greece, Turkey and Uruguay. It is important to note that in a number of instances, such as in
25:924:69281:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bolivia or Chile, in\ration starts declining before CBI. Finally in Figure 6 there is no case where
25:925:69380:18:19:82:283:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI is followed by a large fall in in\ration.
25:926:69425:19:19:99:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The comparison of Figures 4 and 5 shows that, in contrast to our theoretical model, in\ration
25:927:69518:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is generally higher in medium-constraint countries than in low-constraint countries. We do not
25:928:69612:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have an explanation for this pattern. It may re\rect the fact that in countries with low constraints
25:929:69712:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians have access to other instruments for achieving their political objectives and do not
25:930:69808:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:need to rely primarily on monetary policy (which may be a relatively blunt instrument to achieve
25:931:69904:19:18:82:282:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:clientelistic objectives or self-enrichment).
25:932:69949:18:19:99:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The data on government expenditure as percentage of GDP we use in Section 6 were obtained
25:933:70038:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from the World Economic Outlook (IMF).23In our robustness checks we also use additional
25:934:70125:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:macroeconomic variables to control for other time-varying determinants of in\ration. We use the
25:935:70220:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:log of GDP per capita (in constant prices, chain series from PWT 6.2).  Also, to control for
25:936:70312:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the extent to which \fxed exchange rate regimes might have provided an anchor for in\ration
25:937:70403:19:16:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and limited the discretionary use of monetary policy, we use an index of exchange rate \rexibility
25:938:70501:16:15:91:543:149:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:21The in\ration data reported for Qatar by the IFS show an unusual spike in 1998 and 1999. Rather than verifying
25:939:70613:15:11:82:543:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and modifying the data provided by the IMF for every country we use the data exactly as reported by the IFS.
25:940:70721:11:7:82:371:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:However, all our results are robust to excluding Qatar from the sample.
25:941:70792:7:11:91:482:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:22Normalized in\ration is de\fned as in\ration/(1+in\ration), see equation (11) in the next section.

26:945:71109:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:values corresponding to more \rexible exchange rate regimes. The index is reported on an annual
26:946:71204:19:34:82:266:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:basis and covers the period 1972-2001.

26:948:71284:30:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we present our main results concerning the relationship between CBI and in\ration.
26:949:71383:18:30:82:332:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Throughout, the left-hand side variable is de\fned as

26:954:71474:31:19:82:543:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where in\rationc;tdenotes the in\ration rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10% in\ration) for countrycin yeart.
26:955:71570:19:18:82:543:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This transformation is useful, since, otherwise, hyperin\rationary episodes entirely dominate the
26:956:71667:18:19:82:543:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical analysis. An alternative would have been to use the logarithm of in\ration, but this is
26:957:71764:19:19:82:543:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not possible when there are cases of zero in\ration. Moreover, using logs would shift the outlier
26:958:71861:19:18:82:543:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:problem to cases in which there are very low levels of in\ration. With a slight abuse of terminology,
26:959:71962:18:19:82:480:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we refer toyc;tas \in\ration" (rather than referring to it as \normalized in\ration").
26:960:72048:19:19:99:543:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It should be noted throughout that changes in CBI are not randomly assigned or exogenous,
26:961:72137:19:18:82:543:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so the empirical work we present here is intended to uncover robust correlations between central
26:962:72233:18:19:82:543:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:banking reform and contemporaneous or subsequent declines in in\ration. As already noted in the
26:963:72328:19:19:82:543:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Introduction, CBI is often adopted as part of an anti-in\ration package of policies and this can be
26:964:72427:19:19:82:543:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seen in Figures 4 and 5, where we show a number of instances in which in\ration starts declining
26:965:72523:19:18:82:543:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a few years before CBI. This is indicative of a pattern where other anti-in\ration measures might
26:966:72620:18:30:82:409:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be taken simultaneously with or just before the introduction of CBI.

26:968:72749:25:35:82:303:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our general estimating equation for Table 1 is

26:976:72850:35:19:82:543:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Here the \frst summation includes lags of in\ration and helps us control for potential serial cor-
26:977:72948:19:18:82:543:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relation in this variable. The variable of interest is a dummy for CBI, described in the previous
26:978:73045:18:19:82:543:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:section, and denoted byxc;t. Since CBI may have delayed e-ects, we sometimes also control for
26:979:73138:19:19:82:543:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lags of CBI as shown by the second summation. The number of lags of in\ration and CBI are
26:980:73227:19:18:82:543:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taken to be the same for simplicity. In addition, all regressions include the-c's, which stand for
26:981:73325:18:0:82:543:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a full set of country dummies and the!t's, which are a full set of year dummies. The error term
27:982:73422:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:"c;tcaptures all omitted in\ruences. Since CBI is not \randomly assigned," this disturbance term
27:983:73518:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:can be correlated with some of the right-hand side variables. It is therefore important to interpret
27:984:73618:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f10:the estimates we report as conditional correlations rather than causal e-ects. The error term"c;t
27:985:73715:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may also have residual serial correlation and to control for this, throughout all standard errors
27:986:73812:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are fully robust for arbitrary serial correlation at the country level (i.e., clustered at the country
27:987:73914:19:19:82:218:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level, see Wooldridge, 2002).
27:988:73943:19:18:99:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 1-3 of Table 1 examine the whole sample. Columns 4-6 repeat the same regressions
27:989:74031:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:focusing on the sample of countries that changed their CBI and thus rely only on di-erences in
27:990:74125:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the timing of CBI to identify its e-ect on in\ration. The \frst column of Table 1 includes only the
27:991:74224:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contemporaneous CBI dummy,xc;t. The estimate of-0is -0.036 with a (robust) standard error
27:992:74313:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of 0.034. Therefore, in this \frst speci\fcation, there is a negative e-ect of CBI on in\ration, but
27:993:74413:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this e-ect is not statistically signi\fcant at 10%. The magnitude of the coe-cient is also rather
27:994:74510:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:small. This estimate of-0implies that CBI is associated with a reduction in the annual in\ration
27:995:74606:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate of 9 points (for example from 58% to 49%), while the mean of annual in\ration in the whole
27:996:74701:18:19:82:161:446:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:sample is 58%.24
27:997:74717:19:19:99:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The speci\fcation in column 1 does not control for persistence in in\ration, however. Since
27:998:74808:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration is a highly serially-correlated variable doing so can have major e-ects on the estimates.
27:999:74907:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 2 thus includes \fve lags of in\ration, but still only the contemporaneous CBI dummy.
27:1000:74999:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:When these lags are included, one can distinguish between short and long-run e-ects of CBI. The
27:1001:75094:19:29:82:393:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:short-run e-ect is still given by-0, whereas the long run e-ect is

27:1009:75284:19:19:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:long run e-ect. It shows that neither the short run nor the long-run e-ect are signi\fcant. For
27:1010:75379:19:18:82:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example, the long-run e-ect is about double the impact of CBI on in\ration suggested in column
27:1011:75473:18:19:82:543:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1, but it is only signi\fcant at 13%. The lags of in\ration themselves are highly signi\fcant. The
27:1012:75571:19:19:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results in the \frst two columns therefore show that despite the preponderance of theory and some
27:1013:75668:19:18:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence that CBI is important in practice, in this broad sample of countries the e-ect of CBI on
27:1014:75765:18:19:82:324:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration is modest and not statistically signi\fcant.

27:1016:75909:16:15:91:543:142:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:24To calculate the economic magnitude of the coe-cient estimates, we use average in\ration over our sample
27:1017:76015:15:11:82:543:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:period. If, instead, we use median in\ration (8% instead of 58%), then the magnitude is even smaller and suggests
27:1018:76128:11:11:82:543:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:CBI reduces in\ration by 4 points. Throughout, the economic magnitudes implied by median in\ration are about

28:1034:76904:19:19:82:459:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:short and the long-run e-ects are negative and the estimated e-ects are larger.
28:1035:76983:19:18:99:543:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:All in all then the basic message of Table 1 is that there is some weak evidence that CBI does
28:1036:77077:18:19:82:543:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduce in\ration and this is particularly true when we only look at the sample of countries that
28:1037:77173:19:29:82:249:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changed their CBI over the period.

28:1039:77274:26:19:82:543:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why does CBI not have a more major (quantitatively more signi\fcant) e-ect on in\ration? The
28:1040:77366:19:19:82:543:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:answer we will propose is based on the motivating theory presented in Section 3, that CBI will have
28:1041:77465:19:18:82:543:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a strong e-ect on in\ration only in societies with intermediate levels of constraints on politicians.

28:1043:77652:19:19:82:543:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Speci\fcally, for each country one of these dummies takes the value 1, while the other two take the

28:1071:78348:19:18:82:543:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of country and time-varying covariates,Zc;t(with a vector of coe-cients denoted by-). These
28:1072:78439:18:0:82:472:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covariates will be included in the robustness checks reported in Tables 7a and 7b.
29:1073:78523:0:19:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2 reports the results of estimating (13) in our base sample, with constraints measured
29:1074:78615:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the average constraint on executive from the Polity IV data as described in Section 4. The
29:1075:78710:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\frst 3 columns are for the whole sample. Column 1 is again the most parsimonious speci\fcation,
29:1076:78806:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which does not include any lags of in\ration or of the CBI dummy. The estimates suggest that
29:1077:78898:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI has no e-ect on in\ration in low and high-constraint societies, but has a marginally signi\fcant
29:1078:78998:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect of -0.071 (standard error of 0.044) in the sample of medium-constraint societies. This e-ect
29:1079:79096:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is twice the size of the estimate in column 1 of Table 1, showing that almost all of the e-ect in
29:1080:79193:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 1 is due to the impact of CBI on in\ration in societies with intermediate levels of constraints.
29:1081:79295:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Moreover, the p-values at the bottom of the table indicate that we can reject the null hypothesis
29:1082:79392:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the impact of CBI in the medium-constraint group is equal to the e-ect in the low or the
29:1083:79485:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high-constraint group. Column 2 shows similar results when the lags of in\ration are included
29:1084:79578:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(again the e-ect of CBI on in\ration is statistically signi\fcant at about 7% signi\fcance level).
29:1085:79676:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:However, in this case, even though the long-run e-ect in the medium-constraint group is almost
29:1086:79770:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:twice as large as the e-ect for the low-constraint group, we can no longer reject the null hypothesis
29:1087:79871:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that they are equal (we continue to reject the hypothesis that the e-ect is the same between high
29:1088:79968:19:19:82:246:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and medium-constraint countries).
29:1089:80001:19:18:99:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The speci\fcation that includes the lags of CBI, as well as the lags of in\ration, is reported
29:1090:80095:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in column 3. Now the long-run e-ect in the sample of countries with intermediate constraints is
29:1091:80190:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:larger at -0.125, and is signi\fcant at about 6%. The e-ects in societies with high or low constraints
29:1092:80292:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continue to be insigni\fcant. In this speci\fcation, we can reject that the e-ect of CBI is the same
29:1093:80392:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the medium and low-constraint countries at 10% (and we continue to reject that they are the
29:1094:80486:19:19:82:310:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same in the high and medium countries at 1%).
29:1095:80531:19:19:99:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 4-6 estimate the same models for the sample of countries that experienced a change
29:1096:80621:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in CBI. The e-ects of CBI in medium-constraint countries are now quantitatively larger and
29:1097:80711:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more signi\fcant. The short-run e-ect of -0.097 in column 4 is signi\fcant and implies that CBI
29:1098:80806:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is associated with a decline in in\ration of 24 points for this group of countries.25We continue
29:1099:80902:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to reject the hypotheses that this e-ect is the same as that for high or low-constraint countries.
29:1100:81000:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In columns 5 and 6, once we include lags of the CBI dummy and in\ration, the short-run e-ect
29:1101:81092:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:becomes smaller and less signi\fcant, but the long-run e-ects are statistically and economically
29:1102:81188:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcant. The e-ect in column 6 of -0.196, for example, implies CBI reduces in\ration by 49
29:1103:81282:19:18:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points. As in columns 1-3 there is no evidence that CBI in\ruences in\ration in countries with high
29:1104:81381:18:16:82:543:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints. However, the results in these columns show some evidence that CBI might have a
29:1105:81472:16:15:91:543:112:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:25If we use median in\ration to calculate the magntiude of the coe-cient, the coe-cient implies that CBI reduces
29:1106:81584:15:0:82:171:97:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in\ration by 11 points.
30:1107:81609:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:negative long-run e-ect on in\ration in low-constraint countries, though this e-ect is smaller than
30:1108:81708:19:19:82:261:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that for medium-constraint countries.
30:1109:81745:19:18:99:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, we conclude from this evidence that the conditional correlations between the intro-
30:1110:81837:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:duction of CBI and changes in in\ration are broadly consistent with the theoretical ideas suggested
30:1111:81936:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Section 3. In particular, CBI appears to be followed by declines in in\ration in countries with
30:1112:82034:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate levels of constraints on politicians, while there is no evidence of a negative e-ect of
30:1113:82134:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI on in\ration in high-constraint countries. In low-constraint countries, there is typically no
30:1114:82231:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect of CBI on in\ration, though some speci\fcations show negative but less signi\fcant e-ects.
30:1115:82327:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, it is worth noting that while we can reject the hypothesis that the e-ect of CBI on
30:1116:82424:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration is di-erent between high and medium-constraint countries, we can only reject the same
30:1117:82519:18:30:82:470:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hypothesis in some of the speci\fcations for medium and low-constraint countries.
30:1118:82600:30:25:82:179:491:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:5.3  Robustness
30:1119:82615:25:19:82:543:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tables 3-7 investigate the robustness of these results. In Table 3 we replicate columns 1, 3, 4 and
30:1120:82714:19:19:82:543:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:6 of Table 2, but using the rule of law and control of corruption indices constructed by Kaufmann
30:1121:82811:19:19:82:543:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et.al. (2007). The results in columns 1-4 based on the full sample are similar to those in columns
30:1122:82909:19:18:82:543:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1-3 of Table 1 and do not show statistically signi\fcant e-ects of CBI. The results in columns 5-8,
30:1123:83008:18:19:82:543:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which focus on the sample of countries that experienced a change in CBI, are more encouraging for
30:1124:83105:19:19:82:543:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:us. They are broadly similar to those in columns 4-6 of Table 2. Columns 5 and 7 show evidence
30:1125:83199:19:18:82:543:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a statistically signi\fcant short-run e-ect of CBI on in\ration only in the countries with medium
30:1126:83299:18:19:82:543:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutions (both when using the rule of law or control of corruption indices). These coe-cients
30:1127:83396:19:19:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are of similar magnitude to the ones reported in column 4 of Table 2. Columns 6 and 8, on the
30:1128:83489:19:18:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other hand, show evidence of a negative statistically signi\fcant long-run e-ect of CBI on in\ration
30:1129:83589:18:19:82:543:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in both the medium and low-institutions countries. These results again show that the e-ects in
30:1130:83683:19:19:82:543:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the medium and high-institutions countries are statistically di-erent, but we cannot reject the
30:1131:83778:19:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:null hypothesis that the e-ects in the low and medium groups are equal. Overall, the results using
30:1132:83876:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the alternative measures of institutions are generally consistent with those reported in Table 2,
30:1133:83973:18:19:82:543:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though with these measures the di-erences between low and medium-constraint countries are less
30:1134:84067:19:19:82:140:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pronounced.
30:1135:84078:19:18:99:543:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An econometric problem in the estimation of (13) is that the equation includes both \fxed
30:1136:84167:18:19:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects and lagged dependent variables. In the presence of lagged dependent variables, the key
30:1137:84260:19:19:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regressorxc;t(and its lags) will be mechanically correlated with"c;sfors<t, so the standard \fxed
30:1138:84357:19:19:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects estimator, used in Table 2, is inconsistent (e.g., Wooldridge, 2002, chapter 11). However,
30:1139:84454:19:0:82:543:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it can be shown that the \fxed e-ects estimator becomes consistent as the number of time periods
31:1140:84552:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the sample increases (i.e., asT!1). Even though we have a relatively large number of time
31:1141:84644:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:periods here, this source of inconsistency might still be important depending on how close to unit
31:1142:84742:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:root in\ration dynamics are. The most common way of ensuring consistency in this case is to use
31:1143:84837:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the GMM estimator developed by Arellano and Bond (1991). This involves di-erencing (13) to
31:1144:84927:19:31:82:266:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eliminate \fxed e-ects, so that we have

31:1163:85475:18:19:82:543:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 4 reports the results of estimating (14) where we replicate columns 2-3 and 5-6 of Table

31:1165:85655:19:19:82:543:418:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive variable). The results are similar to those of Table 2. In particular, the interactions
31:1166:85752:19:18:82:543:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between the medium constraints dummy and CBI are still negative and the estimates are statisti-
31:1167:85847:18:19:82:543:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cally more signi\fcant than in Table 2. There is no evidence of a negative e-ect of CBI on in\ration
31:1168:85947:19:19:82:543:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in high-constraint countries. The results in Table 4 also show some evidence of a negative e-ect of
31:1169:86046:19:18:82:543:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI in low-constraint countries once we focus on the sample of countries that changed their CBI
31:1170:86141:18:19:82:543:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in columns 3 and 4. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted with caution; though the
31:1171:86235:19:19:82:543:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tests for serial correlation cannot reject the null hypothesis of no second order correlation in the
31:1172:86335:19:18:82:543:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erenced residuals, the Sargan overidenti\fcation tests reject the null hypothesis in all columns,
31:1173:86435:18:19:82:543:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which implies that di-erent lags estimate di-erent magnitudes for the coe-cients of CBI and
31:1174:86526:19:19:82:512:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lagged in\ration (which is often a problem when using this GMM procedure with largeT).
31:1175:86612:19:19:99:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 5 investigates alternatives to the use of the three dummy variablesHc,McandLcfor
31:1176:86698:19:18:82:543:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high, medium and low constraints on the executive to capture the nonlinear e-ects of this variable.
31:1177:86797:18:19:82:543:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In particular, we use a quadratic in the average of constraints on the executive interacted with
31:1178:86893:19:19:82:543:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the CBI dummy.  The coe-cients reported evaluate the quadratic at the levels 1, 4 and 7 of
31:1179:86983:19:18:82:543:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints on the executive. The results in Table 5 are broadly similar to those in Table 2. The
31:1180:87080:18:19:82:543:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:short and long-run e-ect of CBI on in\ration is always negative and signi\fcant for countries with
31:1181:87178:19:19:82:543:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate constraints. There is no evidence of a signi\fcant e-ect of CBI in countries with high
31:1182:87277:19:19:82:543:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or low constraints. However, even though the e-ects are larger in the medium than in the low
31:1183:87369:19:0:82:543:81:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and high-constraint groups, we can only reject that they are equal when comparing the high and
32:1184:87465:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate group. Overall, these results suggest that the speci\fc way of parameterizing the
32:1185:87559:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nonlinearity in the exact cuto-s between low, medium and high constraints is not too important
32:1186:87653:19:18:82:152:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for our results.
32:1187:87669:18:19:99:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 6 reports the results of a simple falsi\fcation exercise. We include both the contempo-
32:1188:87762:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raneous and the \fve-year lead of CBI. To the extent that in\ration was already declining in some
32:1189:87859:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countriesbeforecentral bank reform, this lead variable will capture the decline. When this is the
32:1190:87956:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case, we cannot have much con\fdence that CBI might in fact be a major factor in the decline in
32:1191:88051:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration. The contemporaneous e-ect of CBI in countries with intermediate levels of constraints
32:1192:88147:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is still signi\fcant. The \fve-year lead is never negative for this group and typically very small.
32:1193:88246:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hence the negative association between CBI and in\ration in this group of countries is not driven
32:1194:88343:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mainly by a secular decline in in\ration. For high-constraint countries, the lead of CBI is also
32:1195:88439:19:19:82:543:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:never signi\fcant and is typically very small. For low-constraint countries, there is some evidence
32:1196:88538:19:19:82:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a prior trend upwards in in\ration. This suggests that in some of these cases CBI may have
32:1197:88631:19:18:82:421:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been introduced in the midst of particularly high in\rationary episodes.
32:1198:88703:18:19:99:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, Tables 7a and 7b conduct a range of other robustness checks. In Table 7a we focus
32:1199:88793:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the full sample and we use the equivalents of columns 1 and 3 of Table 2. In Table 7b we
32:1200:88884:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrict ourselves to the sample of countries that changed their CBI and use the equivalents of
32:1201:88979:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:columns 4 and 6 of Table 2. Columns 1 and 2 of Tables 7a and 7b report the robustness of the
32:1202:89071:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results to including potential time varying determinants of in\ration. In particular we include 5
32:1203:89168:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lags of log of GDP per capita and 5 lags of an exchange rate \rexibility index constructed by
32:1204:89261:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Reinhart and Rogo- (2002). While the negative e-ect of CBI on in\ration is not signi\fcant when
32:1205:89356:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we focus on the full sample, the results in Table 7b show a similar pattern to the one depicted in
32:1206:89454:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2 with a negative and statistically signi\fcant long run e-ect of CBI only in the group with
32:1207:89552:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate constraints on the executive. The results in columns 3 and 4 of Tables 7a and 7b
32:1208:89645:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include a quadratic time trend interacted with region dummies to control for di-erential trends in
32:1209:89743:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration across regions. These additional controls have little e-ect on the estimates. In column
32:1210:89840:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3 of Table 7a, the estimate of the impact of CBI in medium-constraint countries is -0.065, with
32:1211:89935:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a standard error of 0.044 which is similar to that reported in column 1 of Table 2. The long-run
32:1212:90031:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect in column 4 however, is smaller in magnitude and less signi\fcant than in column 2 of Table
32:1213:90128:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2. Nevertheless, columns 3 and 4 in Table 7b show that in the sample of countries that changed
32:1214:90222:19:18:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI, once we control for di-erential regional trends, the results are again similar to those in Table
32:1215:90323:18:19:82:90:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2.
32:1216:90325:19:19:99:543:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In columns 5 and 6 of Tables 7a and 7b, we exclude Western Europe entirely. This robustness
32:1217:90416:19:0:82:543:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:check is motivated by the concern that policy dynamics and the e-ect of CBI on in\ration might
33:1218:90512:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be di-erent in Western Europe than the rest of the world. It is therefore useful to see whether
33:1219:90607:19:19:82:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar results are obtained when the contrast with the West European countries is removed. The
33:1220:90702:19:18:82:378:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results in this case are again similar to the baseline estimates.
33:1221:90767:18:19:99:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 7 and 8 include an additional dummy for the introduction of the European Central
33:1222:90855:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bank or the country in question joining the monetary union after the European Central Bank.
33:1223:90946:19:19:82:419:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Again, there is little change here from the results we found in Table 2.
33:1224:91018:19:18:99:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, columns 9 and 10 show the robustness of our results to using the CBI index constructed
33:1225:91113:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by Cukierman rather than the CBI dummy. While, as discussed in Section 4, there are concerns
33:1226:91205:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:related to the coding and interpretation of this index, it still constitutes a useful check on our
33:1227:91303:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure of CBI and on our results. The results using this index are similar to those reported in
33:1228:91399:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2. As with our main results, only the interaction between the medium constraints dummy
33:1229:91491:19:19:82:390:502:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:and the new CBI index is negative and statistically signi\fcant.26
33:1230:91557:19:19:99:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Interestingly, in columns 5-10 of both Tables 7a and 7b we can now reject the null hypothesis
33:1231:91650:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the e-ects in the intermediate group are equal to those in the low or in the high-constraint
33:1232:91747:18:19:82:112:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group.
33:1233:91753:19:19:99:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also checked the robustness of the results reported in Table 2 to the \type" of CBI di\u000berent
33:1234:91853:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries implemented. In particular, we ran the same regressions as in Table 2 with a dummy
33:1235:91945:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for \goal independence" of the CBI. This dummy takes a value of 1 for countries where CBI
33:1236:92034:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform de\fned in\ration as the unique objective of monetary policy and zero everywhere. This is
33:1237:92130:19:18:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a useful robustness check against the possibility that CBI may have very di-erent e-ects when
33:1238:92223:18:19:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the central banker is truly \conservative" with price stability as the unique objective (as with
33:1239:92319:19:19:82:543:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Bundesbank) than in instances where CBI has multiple objectives (as with the U.S. Federal
33:1240:92412:19:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Reserve). The results using the \goal independence" CBI dummy are analogous to those in Table
33:1241:92505:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2 and suggest a similar pattern with a negative e-ect of goal independence on in\ration only in
33:1242:92600:18:19:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:countries with intermediate constraints on the executive. We do not report these results to save
33:1243:92696:19:19:82:543:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:space. We also brie\ry investigated whether changes in the dynamics and persistence of in\ration
33:1244:92792:19:18:82:543:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the mid-1980s, documented for example by Mumtaz and Surico (2006) and Stock and Watson
33:1245:92881:18:19:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2007), might be responsible for our results. As a crude control for this possibility, we interacted
33:1246:92981:19:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the lags of in\ration with a dummy for the period 1972-1990 and a dummy for the period 1991-2005.
33:1247:93078:19:19:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The results of this exercise led to a similar pattern to that found in Table 2, with a negative e-ect
33:1248:93179:19:16:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of CBI only in countries with intermediate constraints on the executive, though the statistical

33:1250:93381:14:11:82:543:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:index is associated with a decrease of 11 points in the in\ration rate in countries with intermediate constraints. The
33:1251:93499:11:11:82:543:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:coe-cient in column 10, on the other hand, suggests that an increase of one standard deviation in the CBI index
33:1252:93610:11:0:82:274:94:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:decreases in\ration by 18 points in the long run.
34:1253:93661:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcance of some of the estimates became weaker. These results are again not reported to save

34:1255:93764:34:30:82:234:655:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:6  The Seesaw E-ect
34:1256:93783:30:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we investigate the implications of CBI reform for other dimensions of policy.
34:1257:93877:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In particular, we look at whether CBI is followed by an increase in government expenditure as
34:1258:93970:18:19:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a percent of GDP in societies with intermediate political constraints.  Our basic econometric
34:1259:94063:19:19:82:543:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model is again (13) but now the dependent variable will measure \fscal policy. Table 8 reports the
34:1260:94161:19:18:82:543:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erential e-ects of CBI in high, medium and low-constraint societies on government expenditure
34:1261:94257:18:19:82:543:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as percentage of GDP. The table shows that there is no evidence that introducing CBI in countries
34:1262:94354:19:19:82:543:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with high or low constraints has any impact on government expenditure relative to GDP in either
34:1263:94449:19:19:82:543:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the short or long-run. However, in medium-constraint countries, where CBI is associated with
34:1264:94541:19:18:82:543:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:declines in in\ration, CBI also appears to be associated with an increase in government expenditure.
34:1265:94641:18:19:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Both the short and the long-run e-ects are positive for these countries in all speci\fcations, and
34:1266:94739:19:19:82:543:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in columns 2, 3, and 5, these e-ects are statistically signi\fcant.  In column 2 the estimated
34:1267:94833:19:18:82:544:419:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:-M0is 0.011 with a standard error of 0.004, and suggests an immediate increase in government
34:1268:94925:18:19:82:543:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expenditure equivalent to just above 1% of GDP. The long-run e-ect of 0.050 is also signi\fcant
34:1269:95020:19:19:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and corresponds to a substantial 5% point increase in government expenditure relative to GDP
34:1270:95112:19:19:82:435:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the long-run in medium-constraint countries that have introduced CBI.
34:1271:95184:19:18:99:543:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 9 shows that the broad pattern is similar when we use the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator
34:1272:95275:18:19:82:543:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(as in Table 4). In this case, the evidence consistent with the seesaw e-ect is somewhat stronger,
34:1273:95373:19:19:82:543:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though now we also \fnd some positive long-run e-ect of CBI on government expenditure in low-
34:1274:95466:19:18:82:543:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraint countries (see, for example, column 2). Finally, Table 10 reports a falsi\fcation exercise
34:1275:95567:18:19:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar to that in Table 6. Here we again include a 5 year lead of the CBI dummy to check whether
34:1276:95664:19:19:82:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the estimates in Table 8 might be capturing a secular upward trend in government expenditure
34:1277:95756:19:19:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in countries with intermediate constraints. The results in Table 10 do not show any evidence of
34:1278:95851:19:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such a pattern. The interaction between the medium constraints dummy and the lead of the CBI
34:1279:95943:18:19:82:313:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dummy is never signi\fcantly di-erent from zero.
34:1280:95991:19:19:99:543:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also checked whether CBI is associated with a change in government budget balance
34:1281:96075:19:18:82:543:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(again measured as a fraction of GDP). These results do not show any signi\fcant e-ect of CBI
34:1282:96168:18:19:82:543:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on government balance (results not reported to save space). This might be because governments
34:1283:96261:19:19:82:543:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in medium-constraint countries, which show a signi\fcant increase in spending, may have also
34:1284:96353:19:18:82:543:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raised revenues.  Alternatively, government balance may have improved automatically because
34:1285:96444:18:0:82:543:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these governments held nominal debt and bene\fted from the decline in interest rates associated
35:1286:96541:0:19:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with reduced in\ration. Counteracting this, however, they are also likely to have experienced a
35:1287:96636:19:19:82:224:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduction in the in\ration tax.
35:1288:96667:19:18:99:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, we conclude that there is some suggestive evidence consistent with the seesaw pattern,
35:1289:96762:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whereby in some of the cases where CBI reduces in\ration, there may be an increase in govern-
35:1290:96855:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment expenditure as a share of GDP. Nevertheless, this result is not always robust and further
35:1291:96949:19:34:82:366:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigation is necessary before reaching a \frm conclusion.
35:1292:97010:34:30:82:190:580:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:7  Conclusions
35:1293:97024:30:18:82:543:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we argue that to understand when policy reform will be e-ective one must under-
35:1294:97118:18:19:82:543:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stand the \political context" that leads to distortionary policies in the \frst place. Though such a
35:1295:97218:19:19:82:543:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:claim would seem natural to those steeped in political economy, it appears not to have in\ruenced
35:1296:97315:19:19:82:543:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:either the design of policy reform in the past or the recent wave of revisionist research on the
35:1297:97411:19:18:82:543:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:failures of reform. Rather, scholars have taken some recent instances of failures of reform to imply
35:1298:97511:18:19:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the reforms themselves were misconceived because of second-best problems. We believe that
35:1299:97605:19:19:82:543:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a much more fruitful approach is to study the political economy constraints that interact with
35:1300:97699:19:18:82:298:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the implementation and the e-ects of reform.
35:1301:97743:18:19:99:543:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To develop this perspective, we construct a simple political economy model of policy distortions
35:1302:97839:19:19:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and show that when such distortions arise as a result of the political equilibrium, there may be
35:1303:97935:19:19:82:543:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strong forces, from those initially bene\fting from the distortions, that negate the e-ects of the
35:1304:98033:19:18:82:543:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform. The model illustrates in a simple way that both the extent of distortionary policy and the
35:1305:98131:18:19:82:543:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects of reform will generally depend on political institutions (for example, on various measures
35:1306:98229:19:19:82:543:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the constraints on political o-ce holders). The \frst major insight of the model is that policy
35:1307:98327:19:18:82:543:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reform may not be e-ective when constraints are so weak that reform can be undermined or when
35:1308:98420:18:19:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints are su-ciently strong that policy is unlikely to have been highly distortionary to start
35:1309:98520:19:19:82:543:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with. Rather, it is at intermediate values of constraints that policy reform might be most e-ective.
35:1310:98620:19:19:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The second important lesson from the model is that with multiple policy instruments, when reform
35:1311:98716:19:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is partially e-ective, it may lead to theseesaw e-ect, whereby reform in one dimension leads to
35:1312:98811:18:19:82:339:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more intensive use of other distortionary instruments.
35:1313:98865:19:19:99:543:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper also provides empirical evidence consistent with these patterns in the context of
35:1314:98956:19:18:82:543:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI. Our evidence suggests that CBI is associated with signi\fcant declines in in\ration in countries
35:1315:99057:18:19:82:543:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with medium constraints, while there are no or smaller e-ects for countries with high and low
35:1316:99150:19:19:82:543:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constraints. There is also some evidence that, consistent with the seesaw e-ect, in countries where
35:1317:99249:19:18:82:543:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:CBI is associated with reduced in\ration, there is also an increase in government expenditure. This
35:1318:99348:18:0:82:543:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might partly re\rect the use of an alternative policy instrument to achieve goals that high in\ration
36:1319:99451:0:19:82:226:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was previously being used for.
36:1320:99481:19:19:99:543:689:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Do these results imply that policy reform can never work? We do not think this is the correct
36:1321:99574:19:18:82:543:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conclusion. Firstly, our evidence is consistent with the view that targeted reforms, such as anti-
36:1322:99672:18:19:82:543:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ration programs and CBI, can be e-ective. Secondly, the evidence is di-cult to reconcile with a
36:1323:99770:19:19:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:naive approach which assumes that politicians adopt reforms for well meaning reasons or because
36:1324:99865:19:19:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they have decided that their old policies were inappropriate. In this light, if reforms fail to be
36:1325:99963:19:18:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fully e-ective, this must be at least partly because of the constraints placed by existing political
36:1326:100063:18:19:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economy factors. In particular, when reforms are promoted by international organizations and
36:1327:100155:19:19:82:543:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imposed on reluctant leaders, they are less likely to be e-ective, or at the very least, they need to
36:1328:100256:19:18:82:543:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be designed much more carefully to ensure e-ectiveness. Otherwise, our model and the empirical
36:1329:100350:18:19:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlations suggest thatde jurereform may not translate intode factoreform, and when it does,
36:1330:100444:19:19:82:289:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other dimensions of policy may deteriorate.
36:1331:100487:19:19:99:543:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The general message from our paper is that the analysis of policy reform should start with
36:1332:100577:19:18:82:543:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an understanding of the political economy constraints leading to distortionary policies in the \frst
36:1333:100677:18:19:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:place. This type of political economy analysis might be ultimately useful both to predict when
36:1334:100771:19:19:82:543:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reforms are likely to be e-ective and to understand how reforms can be designed better so as to
36:1335:100866:19:18:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reduce the risk of backlash. While we are currently far from a satisfactory theoretical or empirical
36:1336:100966:18:19:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:understanding to be able to design policy reforms that are robust to such challenges, we hope that
36:1337:101064:19:19:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our paper and others in this vein make the case that an analysis of the political economic roots
36:1338:101160:19:0:82:533:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of distortionary policies must be part of any debate on the e-ectiveness and design of reforms.
