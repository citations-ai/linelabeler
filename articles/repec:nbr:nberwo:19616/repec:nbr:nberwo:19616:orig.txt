2:30:1430:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We examine the role of structural change in the economic development of Vietnam from 1990 to 2008.
2:31:1528:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:Structural change accounted for a third of the growth in aggregate labor productivity during this period,
2:32:1633:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:which averaged 5.1 percent per annum. We discuss the role of reforms in agriculture, enterprises, and
2:33:1734:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:international integration in this process. In addition to the drastic move of employment away from
2:34:1832:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:agriculture toward services and manufacturing, we also document the movement of workers away
2:35:1924:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:from household businesses toward firms in the enterprise sector, and the reallocation of workers from
2:36:2025:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:state owned firms toward private domestic and foreign owned firms. Manufacturing experienced particularly
2:37:2130:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:rapid growth in labor productivity and a large expansion of employment, as it grew from 8 to 14 percent
2:38:2233:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:of the workforce. Changes in trade policy, expansion of employment in foreign owned firms, and the
2:39:2331:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:declining role of state owned enterprises robustly contributed toward the changing structure of employment
2:40:2437:14:42:72:179:448:12:Times:12:Times:within manufacturing.

3:54:2715:0:13:72:142:709:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1. Introduction 
3:55:2730:13:20:108:510:696:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The idea that poor countries need to undergo a process of structural change, where labor 
3:56:2819:20:21:72:535:676:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reallocates from traditional, low productivity sectors of the economy toward modern, high productivity 
3:57:2922:21:20:72:531:655:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sectors to achieve high levels of aggregate productivity has a long tradition in development economics 
3:58:3024:20:20:71:533:635:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(Lewis 1954, Fei and Ranis 1964, Chenery 1979). More recently, McMillan and Rodrik (2011) document 
3:59:3123:20:20:71:538:615:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:significant gaps in labor productivity between agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and services in a large 
3:60:3230:20:20:71:524:595:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:set of developing countries, and substantial heterogeneity in the contribution of structural change to 
3:61:3332:20:20:71:535:575:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the aggregate economic performance of these economies during the past four decades.  Reallocation of 
3:62:3433:20:20:71:526:555:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor across sectors enhanced aggregate labor productivity in Asian economies, while decreasing it in 
3:63:3535:20:21:71:519:535:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Latin American and African countries within their sample. Our paper examines the role of structural 
3:64:3635:21:20:71:409:514:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:change in the economic development of Vietnam in the 1990s and 2000s.1  
3:65:3707:20:20:107:498:494:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:During the last 20 years Vietnam experienced high rates of economic growth. Real GDP 
3:66:3792:20:20:71:538:474:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:increased at an average annual growth rate of 7 percent between 1986 and 2008, GDP per capita in PPP 
3:67:3893:20:20:71:525:454:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:terms tripled, and poverty rates fell sharply.2 T his economic expansion was accompanied by a drastic 
3:68:3995:20:20:72:533:434:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:shift in the composition of Vietnam’s GDP, as economic activities shifted away from agriculture toward 
3:69:4098:20:20:72:509:414:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:services and manufacturing. Figure 1 depicts the share of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and 
3:70:4196:20:20:71:525:394:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:services in GDP from 1986 to 2009. The most drastic changes occur in agriculture and manufacturing. 
3:71:4296:20:21:71:539:374:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Agriculture accounted for 34 percent of GDP in 1986 and its share decreased continuously to 17 percent 
3:72:4399:21:20:71:531:353:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in 2009. Manufacturing, on the other hand, experienced significant growth. From 17 percent of GDP in 
3:73:4500:20:20:71:504:333:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1986, its share fell sharply in 1989 and 1990 as many state owned enterprises, which dominated 
3:74:4595:20:20:71:494:313:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing at the time, closed down (Dodsworth et al. 1996).  Manufacturing share of GDP 
3:75:4687:20:20:71:524:293:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:subsequently climbed steadily to 25 percent in 2009, surpassing the share of agriculture in 2003. The 
3:76:4789:20:20:71:518:273:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:service sector accounted for the largest share of GDP, with its contribution increasing from 46 to 54 
3:77:4891:20:20:71:505:253:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent over the period. Mining and quarrying never accounted for more than 6 percent of GDP. 
3:78:4984:20:21:107:530:233:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam also experienced a large expansion of its labor force,  as employment increased at an 
3:79:5078:21:65:71:524:212:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:average annual rate of 2.4 percent, accompanied by a drastic change in the structure of employment 
3:80:5177:65:9:72:219:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
3:81:5233:9:15:72:520:138:42:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f1:1 Ideally we would examine the role of structural change over a period of time encompassing several decades. 
3:82:5341:15:12:72:502:123:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:There is no publicly available data on employment and GDP by sector prior to 1990 even at a high level of 
3:83:5447:12:7:72:506:111:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:aggregation. Vietnam is also not included in the Groningen Database used by McMillan and Rodrik (2011).  
3:84:5552:7:18:72:531:104:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:2 The information on real GDP, real GDP per capita in PPP terms, and poverty is from the General Statistics Office 
3:85:5667:18:12:72:536:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:of Vietnam, the Penn World Tables 7.1 (Heston, Summers and Aten 2012), and the World Development Indicators 
3:86:5775:12:0:72:253:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:database (henceforth the WDI) respectively. 
4:87:5819:0:20:72:502:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:across economic sectors.3 Figure 2 displays the share of agricultural, manufacturing, and service 
4:88:5917:20:20:71:538:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment in total employment from 1990 to 2008. Vietnam started off as a highly agrarian economy. 
4:89:6016:20:20:72:504:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:In 1990 over 70 percent of workers were in agriculture, with the remaining workers employed in 
4:90:6111:20:20:72:542:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:services (18 percent), manufacturing (8 percent), and mining (1 percent). By 2008 the employment share 
4:91:6214:20:20:72:526:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of agriculture had shrunk drastically from 73 percent to 54 percent, with workers reallocating toward 
4:92:6316:20:21:72:533:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:services and manufacturing. The employment share of services grew from 18 to 32 percent and that of 
4:93:6416:21:20:72:535:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing from 8 to 14 percent. Mining and quarrying never accounted for more than 1 percent of 
4:94:6516:20:20:72:166:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:overall employment. 
4:95:6535:20:20:108:540:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:These large shifts in the sectoral composition of Vietnamese GDP and employment motivate our 
4:96:6628:20:20:72:537:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:focus on the role of structural change in Vietnam’s economic development during the 1990s and 2000s. 
4:97:6729:20:20:72:537:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:We begin by quantifying the contribution of structural change to growth in aggregate labor productivity 
4:98:6832:20:20:72:502:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in Section 2. We find that the reallocation of employment away from agriculture toward service 
4:99:6927:20:21:72:531:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industries and manufacturing, all sectors with relatively higher labor productivity, played an important 
4:100:7032:21:20:72:97:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:role.  
4:101:7039:20:20:108:537:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:What contributed to Vietnam’s economic transformation? To begin to answer this question it is 
4:102:7133:20:20:72:538:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:important to highlight the level of development and the structure of Vietnam’s economy at the onset of 
4:103:7236:20:20:72:533:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:its economic reforms. In 1986 Vietnam’s GDP per capita in PPP (2005 international dollars) was around 
4:104:7338:20:20:72:517:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:only $800 (Penn World Table 7.1). This positioned Vietnam within the poorest quintile of countries, 
4:105:7438:20:20:71:541:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:ahead of Cambodia and Bangladesh, but behind Laos and Kenya. The highly agrarian nature of Vietnam’s 
4:106:7539:20:21:71:509:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:economy placed   it in the top quintile of countries with the largest share of agriculture in GDP and 
4:107:7641:21:20:71:532:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:among the top 10 percent of countries with the highest share of workers in agriculture throughout the 
4:108:7743:20:20:71:152:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990s ( the WDI).  
4:109:7762:20:20:107:493:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Beginning in 1986 Vietnam initiated a set of reforms collectively known as Doi Moi, or 
4:110:7849:20:20:71:497:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:“renovation”, to gradually transform the economy from central planning to a regulated market 
4:111:7942:20:20:71:512:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:economy. We discuss in Section 3 the role of key reforms in agriculture, the enterprise sector, and 
4:112:8042:20:20:71:525:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:integration of Vietnam into the global economy that could have contributed toward the shift of labor 
4:113:8143:20:21:71:157:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:out of agriculture.  
4:114:8164:21:20:107:505:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:These reforms had the potential to not only influence the movement of labor away from 
4:115:8250:20:22:71:505:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture toward manufacturing and services, but also the allocation of labor across household 
4:116:8347:22:7:72:219:123:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
4:117:8403:7:17:72:540:116:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:3 The share of the population age 15 or older who were working declined from 86 percent in 1993 to 75 percent by 
4:118:8516:17:13:71:522:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:2006 (based on authors’ estimates using household survey data). By comparison, the WDI database suggests a 
4:119:8623:13:12:71:490:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:decline from 77 percent in 1992 to 72 percent in 2009. The same database suggests a slight increase in 
4:120:8726:12:0:71:336:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:unemployment, from 1.9 percent in 1996 to 2.4 percent in 2008. 
5:121:8789:0:20:72:542:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:businesses, state owned enterprises, foreign owned firms, and private enterprises within each sector.  In 
5:122:8895:20:20:71:525:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Section 4 we document labor reallocation across these types of firms, which differ in their underlying 
5:123:8998:20:20:71:534:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:performance,  and the potential for such labor reallocation to contribute toward aggregate productivity 
5:124:9102:20:20:71:538:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:gains. Section 5 highlights industries that contributed most to the observed expansion of manufacturing 
5:125:9206:20:20:71:486:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment during the 2000s and the underlying changes in the structure of manufacturing 
5:126:9295:20:21:71:532:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment. This analysis suggests that manufacturing industries that experienced greater declines in 
5:127:9397:21:20:71:525:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment in state owned enterprises and greater increases in employment in foreign owned firms 
5:128:9493:20:20:71:479:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:expanded their relative employment, contributing more toward the rapid expansion of the 
5:129:9581:20:20:71:541:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing sector. Section 6 briefly compares Vietnam’s growth experience with other countries that 
5:130:9684:20:20:71:439:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:started the 1990s at similar levels of economic development.  Section 7 concludes.

5:134:9819:21:20:107:521:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:To what extent did the large shifts of labor out of agriculture noted in Figure 2 contribute to 
5:135:9915:20:20:71:540:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:aggregate productivity growth? We use the framework from McMillan and Rodrik (2011) to examine the 
5:136:10014:20:20:71:510:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:relative importance of structural change and sectoral productivity growth for aggregate growth in 
5:137:10112:20:20:71:537:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam.  The framework decomposes the aggregate change in labor productivity into two components: 
5:138:10211:20:20:71:511:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:growth within sectors and growth due to labor reallocation across sectors that differ in their labor

5:149:10589:20:20:71:510:243:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the part of aggregate growth in productivity due to growth within sectors. The second term in the 
5:150:10687:20:20:71:528:223:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:decomposition is the “structural change” term, measuring how labor reallocation contributes to labor 
5:151:10788:20:20:71:497:203:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity growth. We conduct the above decomposition using data provided by the General 
5:152:10879:20:20:72:516:183:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Statistical Office (GSO) on output and employment for nine broad sectors,  defined in McMillan and 
5:153:10978:20:20:71:535:163:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Rodrik (2011), from 1990 to 2008. Output is expressed in 1994 Dong. Labor productivity is measured as 
5:154:11080:20:32:71:231:143:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:real output per worker in a sector.4

5:156:11172:7:18:72:532:104:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:4 These labor productivity measures capture average productivity rather than marginal productivity. As discussed 
5:157:11285:18:12:72:505:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:in McMillan and Rodrik (2011), comparisons of average productivity gaps across sectors can be potentially 
5:158:11391:12:0:72:534:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:misleading if the production function is not Cobb-Douglas and if labor shares of value added differ across sectors. 
6:159:11508:0:20:108:525:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Figure 3 depicts the decomposition results. Aggregate labor productivity grew on average 5.1 
6:160:11601:20:20:71:547:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent annually. Improvements in sectoral productivities accounted for the majority (62   percent) of the 
6:161:11708:20:20:71:527:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor productivity growth during this period. P roductivity growth was uneven across the nine sectors. 
6:162:11810:20:20:71:521:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Table 1 reports sectoral labor productivities in 1990, 2000, and 2008. While productivity levels more 
6:163:11912:20:20:71:505:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:than doubled   in mining, manufacturing, and public utilities, they stayed relatively unchanged for 
6:164:12012:20:21:71:528:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:wholesale and retail trade, hotels, and restaurants, and for financial services. Agricultural productivity 
6:165:12119:21:20:71:542:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent during this period. Although agricultural labor productivity 
6:166:12226:20:20:72:534:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:remained low relative to other sectors and grows substantially less than productivity in manufacturing, 
6:167:12330:20:20:72:528:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agricultural productivity growth nonetheless contributed 15.1 percent to aggregate labor productivity 
6:168:12432:20:20:72:491:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:growth owing to agriculture’s large share in total employment. In comparison, manufacturing 
6:169:12524:20:20:71:527:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity grew at an average annual rate of 5.1 percent and contributed 22.1 percent to aggregate 
6:170:12625:20:20:71:191:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor productivity growth. 
6:171:12652:20:21:107:514:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Table 1 further suggests that apart from agriculture;  wholesale and retail trade, hotels and 
6:172:12746:21:20:71:533:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:restaurants;  and transport, storage and communications, sectoral productivity grew more slowly in the 
6:173:12848:20:20:71:538:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2000s than in the 1990s. For example, manufacturing labor productivity grew on average by 7.1 percent 
6:174:12949:20:20:71:548:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:per annum during the 1990s and by 2.7 percent per annum during the 2000s.    This trend in part accounts 
6:175:13054:20:20:71:534:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for the lower contribution of sectoral productivity growth to aggregate growth in the 2000s than in the 
6:176:13158:20:20:71:188:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990s,  noted in Figure 3.5 
6:177:13185:20:20:107:492:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Structural change accounts for the remaining 38 percent of growth in aggregate labor 
6:178:13270:20:21:71:494:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity. Figure 3 clearly indicates that the structural change component always positively 
6:179:13366:21:20:71:536:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contributes to growth. After playing a relatively small part in the early 1990s, structural change became 
6:180:13472:20:20:71:532:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:an increasingly important component of aggregate growth, and eventually surpassed the within-sector 
6:181:13571:20:20:71:521:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:component in 2001. The significant contribution of growth-enhancing structural change for Vietnam 
6:182:13669:20:20:71:523:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:confirms the trends in McMillan and Rodrik (2011) for other Asian countries during this period. From 
6:183:13769:20:30:71:532:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990 to 2005, countries in Asia experienced, on average, 3.9 percent annual labor productivity growth, 
6:184:13872:30:12:72:543:196:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                                                                                                                                                   
6:185:14051:12:12:72:500:184:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:McMillan and Rodrik (2011) and Gollin, Lagakos and Waugh (2012) argue that large gaps in average labor 
6:186:14154:12:12:72:533:172:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:productivity between agriculture and manufacturing likely reflect large gaps in marginal productivity. In addition, 
6:187:14270:12:13:72:518:160:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:in imperfectly competitive industries these productivity measures might in part capture differences in market 
6:188:14380:13:7:71:484:147:99:g_d0_f1:99:Times:power across industries to the extent that aggregate price deflators do not fully control for this issue. 
6:189:14485:7:17:72:520:140:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:5 With the exception of construction, the sectors that experienced a decline in productivity between 2000 and 
6:190:14595:17:12:72:502:123:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:2008 (mining and quarrying; public utilities; and finance, insurance, real estate and business services) had 
6:191:14704:12:12:72:539:111:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:employment shares below 1 percent. A fall in labor productivity from 2000 to 2008 in these very small sectors may 
6:192:14818:12:13:72:521:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:potentially reflect measurement error in employment in either 2000 or 2008. For example, employment share 
6:193:14924:13:12:72:532:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:estimates for mining and quarrying and public utilities from the 2009 census differ by about a third from the GSO 
6:194:15038:12:0:72:119:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:estimates.  
7:195:15051:0:20:72:513:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of which 16 percent can be attributed to the structural change component. Vietnam’s productivity 
7:196:15148:20:20:72:547:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:growth exceeds the average growth for Asian economies (5.1   percent vs. 3.9 percent) and more strongly 
7:197:15252:20:20:72:406:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:depends on the structural change component ( 38 percent vs. 16 percent).  
7:198:15326:20:20:107:522:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The relatively large contribution of structural change to aggregate productivity in Vietnam in 
7:199:15421:20:20:71:500:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:part reflects the predominantly agrarian nature of the Vietnamese economy in 1990, persistent 
7:200:15515:20:21:71:533:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity gaps across sectors noted in Table 1,  and a drastic move of employment out of agriculture 
7:201:15619:21:20:71:498:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:over the two decades.  The dominant role of agriculture as the source of initially low aggregate 
7:202:15716:20:20:71:537:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity in Vietnam is starkly illustrated in Figure 4, which plots sectoral productivity as a percent of 
7:203:15826:20:20:71:538:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:average economy-wide productivity against the sector’s share in total employment in 1990. Agriculture, 
7:204:15929:20:20:71:536:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:with nearly three quarters of employment, had the lowest labor productivity of all, less than one half of 
7:205:16035:20:20:71:511:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the economy-wide productivity. Labor productivity in manufacturing was substantially higher, but 
7:206:16132:20:20:71:536:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing only accounted for 8 percent of employment.  By 2008 almost 30 percent of workers had 
7:207:16231:20:21:71:526:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:moved   out of agriculture. Figure 5 displays sectoral productivity as a percentage of average economy-
7:208:16334:21:20:71:516:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:wide productivity against the sector’s share in total employment for 2008. Although productivity in 
7:209:16434:20:20:71:487:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture was still significantly lower than in the rest of the economy, agriculture’s share of 
7:210:16532:20:20:71:511:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment had shrunk to 53 percent. By 2008 nearly half of the employed population worked in 
7:211:16626:20:20:71:539:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sectors with relative productivity more than one-fold and less than two-fold the aggregate productivity.  
7:212:16732:20:20:107:524:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Figure 6 summarizes these shifts in employment across sectors by plotting the initial sectoral 
7:213:16827:20:20:71:534:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity against the sectoral employment growth. The size of the bubble reflects the sector’s share 
7:214:16931:20:21:71:528:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of total employment in 1990. The positive slope of the scatter plot illustrates the shift of employment 
7:215:17035:21:20:71:523:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:away from low toward higher productivity sectors.  A decrease of more than 20 percentage points in 
7:216:17134:20:20:71:538:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture’s share of employment was accompanied with about an 8 percentage point expansion in the 
7:217:17234:20:20:71:504:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:share of employment in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, a 6 percentage point 
7:218:17330:20:20:71:508:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:expansion in manufacturing’s share of employment, and about a 3 percentage point expansion in 
7:219:17424:20:20:71:241:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:construction’s share of employment.  
7:220:17461:20:20:107:530:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Growth in sectoral productivities accounted for the majority of Vietnam’s growth in aggregate 
7:221:17554:20:21:71:532:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor productivity in the 1990s,  but Figure 3 shows that structural change became the dominant driver 
7:222:17657:21:20:71:511:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of productivity growth in the 2000s. What accounts for the substantially larger contribution of the 
7:223:17757:20:20:71:520:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:structural change component to aggregate growth in the 2000s as compared to in the 1990s? While 
7:224:17853:20:20:71:534:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:more detailed research is required to understand the accelerated pace of structural change, we discuss 
7:225:17955:20:0:71:200:105:122:g_d0_f1:144:Helvetica:a few possible explanations. 
8:226:17984:0:20:108:523:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The large contribution of sectoral productivity growth to aggregate growth in Vietnam in the 
8:227:18077:20:20:71:487:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990s might be related to the low initial levels of economic development in Vietnam and the 
8:228:18169:20:20:71:539:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:implementation of drastic domestic reforms at the end of 1980s.  Poor economic conditions in the 1980s 
8:229:18272:20:20:71:519:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:induced policy makers to implement wide-ranging reforms in agriculture, the enterprise sector, and 
8:230:18371:20:20:71:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:international integration.   As we discuss in detail in Section 3, these reforms likely contributed toward 
8:231:18478:20:21:71:519:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:increased agricultural productivity and toward increased productivity in manufacturing and services 
8:232:18577:21:20:71:521:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:during the 1990s, as noted in Table 1. T hese initial improvements in sectoral productivity could also 
8:233:18680:20:20:71:529:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contribute to subsequent reallocation of workers from agriculture to manufacturing and services.  For 
8:234:18782:20:20:71:526:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:example, increased agricultural productivity means that fewer workers are required to maintain food 
8:235:18882:20:20:71:496:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:production and leads to increased agricultural incomes which, combined with non-homothetic 
8:236:18973:20:20:71:510:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:preferences, generates increased   demand for non-agricultural goods. Both of these factors would 
8:237:19071:20:20:71:531:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enable subsequent release of agricultural labor. Likewise, productivity gains in non-agricultural sectors 
8:238:19176:20:21:71:524:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:during the 1990s and increased demand for Vietnamese nonagricultural goods on the world markets 
8:239:19272:21:20:71:534:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:could have subsequently pulled agricultural labor to non-agricultural activities.  In both cases, structural 
8:240:19381:20:20:71:491:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:change would follow sectoral productivity improvements. We discuss these reforms and their 
8:241:19472:20:20:71:223:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:implications in detail in Section 3. 
8:242:19508:20:20:107:504:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Earlier discussion suggests that structural change is strongly related to the movement of 
8:243:19598:20:20:71:525:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers out of agriculture and into other sectors. The results in Figure 2,  based on national accounts 
8:244:19702:20:20:71:502:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:data, and separate census estimates both point to acceleration in the movement of labor out of 
8:245:19797:20:21:71:530:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture in the 2000s. The increased importance of structural change during the 2000s could in part 
8:246:19899:21:20:71:497:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reflect demographic changes, which might have accelerated   the decline in the relative share of 
8:247:19996:20:20:71:513:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agricultural employment by increasing the employment share of younger cohorts that entered the 
8:248:20091:20:20:71:532:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workforce directly into high-productivity sectors such as manufacturing and by exiting of older cohorts 
8:249:20195:20:20:71:541:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:out of the labor force directly from agriculture. Shifts in the sectoral composition of the workforce owing 
8:250:20303:20:20:71:537:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to demographics are arguably subject to smaller mobility costs than shifts across sectors among cohorts 
8:251:20406:20:20:71:521:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in the workforce. Although Vietnam’s workforce grew significantly between 2000 and 2008, from an 
8:252:20503:20:21:71:486:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:estimated 36.7 to 44.9 million workers, the movement of workers out of agriculture was not 
8:253:20594:21:20:71:516:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:predominantly driven by the changing demographics of the workforce. Table 2 reports the share of 
8:254:20691:20:20:71:527:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers in agriculture by 5-year cohorts for 1989, 1999, and 2009 from the censuses in the top panel. 
8:255:20793:20:20:71:536:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Over time younger generations of workers have become less likely to work in agriculture, particularly in 
8:256:20898:20:20:71:535:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2009 relative to 1989 and 1999. However, the panel also demonstrates that workers within cohorts left 
8:257:20999:20:0:71:524:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture. For example, 68.2 percent of workers age 20 to 24 worked in agriculture in 1999, but the 
9:258:21102:0:20:72:495:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:share within this cohort (30 to 34 year olds) fell to 47.2 percent in 2009. Thus, the reduction in 
9:259:21201:20:20:71:534:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment in agriculture is not simply due to the entry and exit of cohorts from the workforce. In the 
9:260:21305:20:20:71:532:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:lower panel we report the results from decomposing the aggregate reduction into within and between 
9:261:21404:20:20:71:524:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:cohort effects.6 Focusing on the period between 1999 and 2009, when most of the movement out of 
9:262:21500:20:20:71:531:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture occurred, over 80 percent of the reduction in the share of agricultural employment reflects 
9:263:21603:20:21:72:538:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the changes within cohorts rather than the changes across cohorts described above.  Demographics can 
9:264:21704:21:20:72:505:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:therefore account for a small part of the accelerated pace of structural change during the 2000s. 
9:265:21802:20:20:108:524:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The acceleration in structural change during the 2000s also coincided with increased internal 
9:266:21896:20:20:72:513:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:migration, which appears to be driven by economic reasons ( United Nation Population Fund 2007, 
9:267:21992:20:20:71:508:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Fukase 2013). This has led to a rapid shift in the distribution of employment across regions within 
9:268:22092:20:20:71:511:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam. In particular, the workforce in South East Vietnam grew from 15.7 to 19.0 percent of the 
9:269:22190:20:20:71:541:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:national workforce between 1999 and 2009, according to our estimates using census data. In Section 2.2 
9:270:22293:20:21:71:533:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:we discuss in detail the differences in economic structure across Vietnam’s eight major regions, but for 
9:271:22398:21:20:71:507:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the current discussion it is worth noting that the South East is the region with the lowest share of 
9:272:22499:20:20:71:508:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers in agriculture and the highest share of workers in manufacturing. Thus, accelerated inter-
9:273:22597:20:20:71:508:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:regional migration may have facilitated the increased rate of structural change during the 2000s.

9:277:22801:20:21:71:521:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:across major regions of Vietnam. Vietnam is composed of eight major geographical regions: the Red 
9:278:22899:21:20:71:510:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:River Delta, the North E ast, the North West, the North Central Coast, the South Central Coast, the 
9:279:22999:20:20:71:521:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Central Highlands, the South E ast, and the Mekong River Delta. These regions differ along important 
9:280:23100:20:20:71:505:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:physical and economic dimensions. For example, the Red River Delta and the South E ast contain 
9:281:23195:20:20:71:541:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam’s two most important economic centers, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City,  respectively. As another 
9:282:23297:20:20:71:530:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:example, the North E ast, North West, and Central Highlands are mountainous and populated by many

9:294:24132:12:0:72:422:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:entering and for cohorts that are exiting the workforce we assign a size of 0 after exit. 
10:295:24222:0:20:108:533:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:All regions experienced declines in the share of workers in agriculture, but these declines were 
10:296:24319:20:20:71:536:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:unevenly distributed across regions. Table 3   documents the share of workers within a region working in 
10:297:24424:20:20:71:511:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture and manufacturing in 1989 and 2009 using information from the Population Censuses. 
10:298:24519:20:20:71:543:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Agricultural employment initially varied   widely across regions, ranging from 45 percent in the South E ast 
10:299:24628:20:20:71:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to 85 percent in the North West in 1989. There is significant heterogeneity across Vietnam in terms of 
10:300:24731:20:21:71:525:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:structural change as major economic centers, such as in the South East centered around Ho Chi Minh 
10:301:24830:21:20:71:522:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:City, have significantly shifted employment out of agriculture into manufacturing and services, while 
10:302:24932:20:20:71:534:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:other regions, such as the North West, continue to feature almost complete employment of workers in 
10:303:25032:20:20:71:521:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture.  For example, the region with the lowest share of agricultural workers in 1989, the South 
10:304:25134:20:20:71:540:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:East at 45 percent, experienced one of the largest reductions in agricultural employment, 19 percentage 
10:305:25238:20:20:71:540:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:points, so that by 2009 only about a quarter of its workers were in agriculture. By comparison, the North 
10:306:25343:20:20:71:509:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:West, which had the highest share of agricultural workers in 1989 at 85 percent, saw the smallest 
10:307:25441:20:21:71:536:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reduction, 3.4 percentage points, so that over 80 percent of its workers continue to work in agriculture, 
10:308:25547:21:20:71:261:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the sector with lowest labor productivity.  
10:309:25591:20:20:71:544:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: The regions also faced uneven changes in the prevalence of manufacturing jobs. Table 3   reports 
10:310:25688:20:20:71:537:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the share of workers within a region working in manufacturing. The South E ast and South Central Coast 
10:311:25791:20:20:71:524:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:areas started off with the largest manufacturing employment base in 1989 with 24 and 14 percent of 
10:312:25890:20:20:71:509:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers in manufacturing, respectively. Over the two decades, the manufacturing base expanded 
10:313:25983:20:20:71:526:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:relative to total employment in only 3 regions and these increases were especially pronounced in the 
10:314:26084:20:21:71:526:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:South E ast and the Red River Delta. By 2009, the share of manufacturing employment was noticeably 
10:315:26183:21:20:71:523:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:higher than the 14 percent national average in the South E ast (29 percent), the Red River Delta (16.6 
10:316:26286:20:20:71:536:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent),  and around the national average in the South Central Coast (12 percent).  These same regions 
10:317:26390:20:20:71:394:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:also feature the highest share of workers engaged in service industries.  
10:318:26464:20:20:107:542:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Regional disparities in the movement of labor out of agriculture toward manufacturing are stark. 
10:319:26561:20:20:71:529:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The regions that originally relied less on agriculture and more on manufacturing and that are closer to 
10:320:26665:20:20:71:521:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the major seaports experienced larger movements of labor out of agriculture toward manufacturing 
10:321:26762:20:21:71:521:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(and services).  Among other factors, the existence of major seaports and the early establishment of 
10:322:26863:21:20:71:516:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industrial zones (see next section) in these regions likely contributed to these diverging trends. The 
10:323:26966:20:20:71:506:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:benefits of Vietnam’s economic growth were nonetheless distributed throughout the country, as 
10:324:27060:20:20:71:532:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:demonstrated by the fall in poverty in all regions. For example, despite the slow movement of workers 
10:325:27162:20:20:71:536:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:out of agriculture and the extremely small manufacturing employment base in North West, the poverty 
10:326:27262:20:0:71:525:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:rate dropped from 81 percent in 1993 to 46 percent in 2008 (Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences 
11:327:27362:0:20:72:534:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2011). This may in part reflect productivity improvements within agriculture noted above and a growth 
11:328:27464:20:20:71:312:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in crop output, as discussed in Benjamin et al. (2009).

11:335:28000:20:20:71:531:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:economic decisions based on markets. Dollar and Litvack (1998) and the World Bank (2011) argue that 
11:336:28100:20:20:71:529:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the Communist Party implemented the reforms in response to extremely poor economic conditions in 
11:337:28197:20:20:71:539:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam during the 1980s. N ot only was Vietnam a very poor and highly agrarian country at the onset of 
11:338:28301:20:20:71:523:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reforms, but also it faced low economic growth, famine, large budget deficits, hyperinflation, a trade 
11:339:28404:20:21:71:353:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:embargo from the United States, and drastic cuts in Soviet aid. 
11:340:28467:21:20:107:109:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: 
11:341:28467:20:20:71:182:427:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:3.1 Agricultural reforms 
11:342:28491:20:20:71:542:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: The agricultural sector was, and continues to be,  the largest employer in Vietnam, employing 53 
11:343:28588:20:20:71:507:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent of the workforce in 2009. Agriculture contributed to aggregate labor productivity growth 
11:344:28685:20:20:71:534:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:through improvements in agricultural productivity and through the release of labor to more productive 
11:345:28787:20:20:71:402:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sectors. Agricultural reforms likely influenced both of these components.  
11:346:28861:20:21:107:508:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Agriculture was one of the first sectors to experience substantial reform. Prior to Doi Moi 
11:347:28952:21:20:71:509:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture in Vietnam was organized through collectives. The reforms in 1987 and 1988 legalized 
11:348:29049:20:20:71:535:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:pr  ivate economic activity and exposed farms to markets and competition by eliminating price controls 
11:349:29152:20:20:71:523:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and the state procurement system ( Dollar and Litvack 1998, Glewwe 2004).  The elimination of price 
11:350:29252:20:20:71:526:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:controls had dramatic impacts on producer prices. For example, the official procurement price of rice 
11:351:29354:20:20:71:445:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:was approximately one-tenth of the market price in 1988 (Dollar and Litvack 1998). 
11:352:29436:20:20:107:525:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The reforms replaced farming based on collectives with household farms as the main units of 
11:353:29528:20:21:71:532:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:production. The land was divided amongst the member households (Decree No. 10 in April 1988), who 
11:354:29626:21:20:71:509:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:received a   15-year lease for their plots and could sell agricultural output produced on the plot for 
11:355:29729:20:20:71:533:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:market prices (Glewwe 2004). The 1993 Land Law (Decree No. 5 of 1993) strengthened household land 
11:356:29827:20:20:71:520:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:property rights by increasing tenure to 20 years for annual land (50 years for perennial land), and by 
11:357:29930:20:0:71:514:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:giving households the right to exchange, transfer, lease, inherit, and mortgage their land use rights 
12:358:30033:0:20:72:540:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(Glewwe 2004). Vietnam also started the process of land titling, so that by 1997 half of all land had been 
12:359:30140:20:20:71:231:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:titled (Benjamin and Brandt 2004).  
12:360:30175:20:20:107:524:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Agricultural reforms further relaxed restrictions on external and internal trade of agricultural 
12:361:30272:20:20:71:525:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:goods and inputs, such as fertilizers, during the 1990s. Rice market liberalization played a particularly 
12:362:30378:20:20:71:533:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:influential role due to the dominance of rice in agricultural production at the onset of reforms. Seventy 
12:363:30483:20:21:71:536:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent of Vietnamese households produced rice (Minot and Goletti 2000) and 77 percent of cultivated 
12:364:30584:21:20:71:535:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:land was devoted to rice paddies in 1992 (Wiens 1998). At the time, a rice export quota limited exports 
12:365:30688:20:20:71:504:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of rice and farmers and private traders could not freely trade rice within Vietnam. These policies 
12:366:30787:20:20:71:538:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:depressed the domestic price of rice, especially in the South, and weakened the incentives of farmers to 
12:367:30892:20:20:71:135:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:produce rice.  
12:368:30906:20:20:107:513:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Between 1992 and 1997 Vietnam increased the quota on rice exports from 1 to 4.5 million 
12:369:30993:20:20:71:509:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:metric tons of rice and removed restrictions on internal trade in rice (Benjamin and Brandt 2004), 
12:370:31092:20:21:71:532:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:leading to a 30 percent increase in the price of rice relative to the consumer price index between 1992 
12:371:31196:21:20:71:526:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and 1998. Moreover, the government lifted some restrictions on imports of fertilizers, which reduced 
12:372:31296:20:20:71:539:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:their    price and increased their use, potentially improving labor productivity in agriculture (Benjamin and 
12:373:31406:20:20:71:138:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Brandt 2004).  
12:374:31421:20:20:107:534:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The mix of the abovementioned domestic and external reforms contributed toward the takeoff 
12:375:31511:20:20:71:539:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in agricultural labor productivity growth during the 1990s noted in the previous section. Rice production 
12:376:31617:20:20:71:531:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:increased drastically, growing at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent between 1985 and 1995 (Minot 
12:377:31718:20:21:71:504:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and Golleti 2000) as yields increased from 3.33 to 4.90 tons per hectare between 1992 and 2006 
12:378:31813:21:20:71:513:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(Benjamin et al. 2009). Benjamin and Brandt (2004) find that the associated improvements in rural 
12:379:31911:20:20:71:531:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:incomes were uneven across regions (benefiting the South and the Red River Delta, where most of the 
12:380:32011:20:20:71:511:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:rice is grown, relatively more than the North). Nonetheless, all regions of Vietnam experienced an 
12:381:32110:20:20:71:535:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:increase in agricultural output. Benjamin et al. (2009) report that crop output grew by between 2.5 and 
12:382:32214:20:20:71:524:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:16.0 percent per annum between 1992 and 2006 across Vietnam’s major regions. Indeed, the fastest 
12:383:32310:20:20:71:539:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:growth was in the Central Highlands, North East and North West, regions that are not very specialized in 
12:384:32415:20:21:71:486:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:rice. Instead, these regions experienced faster growth in crops such as vegetables and beans 
12:385:32508:21:20:71:524:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(particularly in the Central Highlands), perennials such as tea and coffee, and fruit (particularly in the 
12:386:32615:20:20:71:503:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:North East). The widespread gains from agricultural growth might reflect initially fairly equitable 
12:387:32715:20:20:71:537:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:allocation of land across households during the Land Law reforms (Ravallion and van de Valle 2008) and 
12:388:32818:20:0:71:474:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the increased opportunity for regions to specialize along lines of comparative advantage.  
13:389:32911:0:20:108:538:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:We are aware of no study that formally examines the impact of agricultural productivity growth 
13:390:33006:20:20:71:537:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:on the “labor push” explanation for the observed movement of labor out of agriculture in Vietnam. One 
13:391:33108:20:20:71:512:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:explanation for a labor push driven structural change is that people in low-productivity agriculture 
13:392:33209:20:20:71:541:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:remain in agriculture to produce a sufficient amount of food for subsistence. Labor can be released from 
13:393:33314:20:20:71:533:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agriculture to more productive activities once agricultural productivity increases above the subsistence 
13:394:33419:20:21:71:520:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:threshold. The drastic expansion of rice production subsequent to the reforms in the late 1980s and 
13:395:33518:21:20:71:540:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990s suggests that Vietnam’s agricultural productivity reached a sufficiently high level for agriculture to 
13:396:33627:20:20:71:503:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:exceed the subsistence level and release labor to more productive activities, as suggested in the 
13:397:33725:20:20:71:494:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:structural transformation model by Gollin, Parente and Rogerson (2007). In fact, following the 
13:398:33820:20:20:71:517:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:implementation of the abovementioned reforms, Vietnam shifted from subsistence agriculture and 
13:399:33915:20:20:71:526:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:importation of rice during the 1980s to being the second largest exporter of rice on world markets by 
13:400:34017:20:20:71:321:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1997 (Dollar and Litvack 1998, Minot and Goletti 2000). 
13:401:34072:20:21:107:531:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:At the same time, Vietnam also experienced several reforms in the enterprise sector that have 
13:402:34166:21:20:71:538:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:likely contributed toward observed increases in nonagricultural productivity and thus provide the “labor 
13:403:34271:20:20:71:457:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:pull” explanation for structural change. We turn to a discussion of these reforms next. 
13:404:34358:20:20:71:109:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:  
13:405:34358:20:20:71:176:387:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f1:3.2 Enterprise reforms 
13:406:34380:20:20:71:510:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Prior to Doi Moi, state owned enterprises (SOEs) were the dominant means of production 
13:407:34466:20:20:71:529:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:outside of agriculture. Dodsworth et al. (1996) report that in 1989 SOEs produced about 29 percent of 
13:408:34568:20:21:71:513:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:overall output and about half of output in industry and services while employing 16 percent of the 
13:409:34667:21:20:71:516:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnamese labor force. SOEs employed about half of the Vietnamese non-agricultural labor force.  
13:410:34765:20:20:107:530:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:As in agriculture, the Doi Moi reforms decentralized decision making and provided enterprises 
13:411:34858:20:20:71:517:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:autonomy over production, pricing and trading. The government implemented policies that further 
13:412:34954:20:20:71:540:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:introduced competition and private enterprise activities, including the entry of foreign owned firms. The 
13:413:35060:20:20:71:509:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Foreign Investment Law of 1987 opened all sectors of the economy other than defense to foreign 
13:414:35155:20:20:71:523:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:investors, allowed for 100 percent foreign ownership of firms and offered foreign firms generous tax 
13:415:35256:20:21:71:534:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:concessions and duty exemptions (Dodsworth et al. 1996). Foreign investment was further encouraged 
13:416:35355:21:20:71:520:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:through the formation of economic zones, such as export processing zones and industrial parks (see 
13:417:35454:20:20:71:526:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Decree No. 332/HDBT in October 1991). The first export processing zone was established near Ho Chi 
13:418:35553:20:20:71:518:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Minh City in November 1991. These zones often offered firms reduced tax rates and exemptions on 
13:419:35649:20:20:71:529:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:import and export duties (see Articles 51 and 52 of Decree No. 332-HDBT and Article 15 of Decree No. 
13:420:35750:20:0:71:534:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:192-CP issued in 1994, for example). More generally, various reforms such as uniform rules of taxation, 
14:421:35856:0:20:72:488:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the freedom for enterprises to form their own trading relationships, and exposure to foreign 
14:422:35949:20:20:71:525:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:competition (discussed in detail in Section 3.3) aimed to level the playing field between SOEs, foreign 
14:423:36053:20:20:72:325:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enterprises, and private enterprises (World Bank 2011).  
14:424:36110:20:20:108:498:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Another set of reforms implemented in 1988-89 directly targeted SOEs. As discussed in 
14:425:36196:20:20:72:542:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Dodsworth et al. (1996), the SOEs received autonomy over the production process and price setting, and 
14:426:36299:20:21:72:515:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:were allowed to lay off workers. Importantly, SOEs had to begin operating subject to   hard budget 
14:427:36398:21:20:71:329:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:constraints and could no longer rely on export subsidies.  
14:428:36457:20:20:107:533:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The combination of these early reforms immediately changed the production incentives within 
14:429:36549:20:20:71:521:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the SOEs, increased their exposure to market forces, and led to a drastic consolidation of the sector. 
14:430:36652:20:20:71:538:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Excluding oil production, SOE value added declined by 7 percent between 1989 and 1991 (Dodsworth et 
14:431:36752:20:20:71:542:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:al. 1996). Between 1989 and 1992 about 800,000 SOE employees (approximately one third) were laid off 
14:432:36853:20:20:71:522:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(Glewwe 2004). The number of SOEs declined dramatically from 12,000 in 1988 to about 6500 in the 
14:433:36949:20:21:71:536:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:mid-1990s (Dodsworth et al. 1996). The consolidation was accomplished mainly through closure (which 
14:434:37049:21:20:71:522:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:disproportionately affected the local government SOEs as opposed to central government SOEs) and 
14:435:37146:20:20:71:512:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:mergers, while privatization was rare (Dodsworth et al. 1996). The consolidation of the SOE sector 
14:436:37245:20:20:71:529:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:slowed down during the rest of the 1990s and much of it was achieved through selling of equity in the 
14:437:37347:20:20:71:500:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:SOEs (World Bank 2002). By 2000, about 5700 SOEs were present and b y 2010, only 3364 SOEs 
14:438:37438:20:20:71:539:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:remained in operation (World Bank 2011), less than a fourth of the SOEs that operated in 1989.  Despite 
14:439:37542:20:20:71:507:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the drastic reform of the sector during the 1990s, the World Bank (2002, 2011) indicates that the 
14:440:37640:20:21:71:528:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:process of SOE restructuring has slowed down during the second part of the 2000s. SOEs now employ 
14:441:37738:21:20:71:515:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:less than 10 percent of the workforce, but they remain an important sector in terms of production, 
14:442:37837:20:20:71:539:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:accounting for about 35 percent of GDP in 2009 and 19 percent of manufacturing output.  Likewise, Dinh 
14:443:37940:20:20:71:493:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Hien Minh, Trinh Quang Long, Dinh Thu Hang, and Pham Thien Hoang (2010) report that state 
14:444:38030:20:20:71:534:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:ownership contributed 36.8 percent of GDP over the 1991-95 period and this actually increased slightly 
14:445:38133:20:20:71:464:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for the period 1996 to 2005, before returning to 36.1 percent over the period 2006-09.  
14:446:38220:20:20:107:535:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) led to a large inflow of FDI in the 1990s and 
14:447:38320:20:21:71:520:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2000s. Foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP increased from 2.8 percent in 1990 to 11.9 
14:448:38419:21:20:71:530:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent in 1994 and then fluctuated between 3.5 and 10.5 percent between 1995 and 2010.7 This was 
14:449:38517:20:20:72:533:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:accompanied by a significant change in the relative share of output produced by the FDI sector, mainly 
14:450:38620:20:39:72:530:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:at the expense of the private non-state domestic sector. The share of output from the FDI sector grew 
14:451:38722:39:7:72:219:86:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
14:452:38778:7:0:72:482:79:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:7 The estimates of FDI as a percentage of GDP are from the World Development Indicators database. 
15:453:38878:0:20:72:482:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:from 6.4 percent over 1994 and 1995 to 18.0 percent over the 2006 to 2009 period with an 
15:454:38967:20:20:72:519:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:accompanied fall in the share of GDP produced by the non-state domestic sector (Minh et al. 2010). 
15:455:39065:20:20:108:539:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Another important reform for the private sector has been the 2000 Enterprise Law, which made 
15:456:39158:20:20:72:520:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:it easier for private enterprises to register and operate across most industries (World Bank 2002). In 
15:457:39261:20:20:72:532:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam, firms either operate as a household business (or a farm) or an officially registered enterprise. 
15:458:39366:20:21:72:496:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The Enterprise Law reduced the time required to register an enterprise, leading to 50,000 new 
15:459:39460:21:20:72:511:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:registered enterprises between January 2000 and October 2002, about three quarters of the total 
15:460:39556:20:20:72:521:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:number of enterprises then registered.  Most of the newly registered enterprises were fully privately 
15:461:39658:20:20:72:528:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:owned and very small in size. World Bank (2002) reports that those registered in 2002 had an average 
15:462:39759:20:20:71:530:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:registered capital of only 90,000 USD.  Malesky and Taussig (2009) report that the 2000 Enterprise Law 
15:463:39862:20:20:71:538:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contributed to the growth in private enterprise firms through firms being more likely to start operations 
15:464:39968:20:20:71:528:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in the enterprise sector, as opposed to in the household business sector, and firms transitioning more 
15:465:40071:20:21:71:378:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:quickly from the household business sector to the enterprise sector. 
15:466:40139:21:20:107:538:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The enterprise sector reforms have dramatically changed the business environment in Vietnam. 
15:467:40232:20:20:71:529:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:According to Doing Business 2013 (World Bank 2013), Vietnam was ranked 99 out of 185 countries on 
15:468:40330:20:20:71:531:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the ease of doing business. This ranks it only slightly behind China, ranked 91st, and ahead of countries 
15:469:40436:20:20:72:527:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:such as Indonesia and Bangladesh. The current ranking reflects significant improvements over time in 
15:470:40537:20:20:72:532:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:some business environment characteristics tied directly to enterprise sector reforms. For example, the 
15:471:40640:20:20:71:527:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:number of days needed to start a business fell from 59 to 38 and the percentage of income per capita 
15:472:40741:20:21:71:524:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:required to start a business has decreased from 31.9 to 12.1 percent between 2003 and 2010 (World 
15:473:40839:21:20:71:156:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Bank 2004, 2013).  
15:474:40857:20:20:107:531:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Overall, the associated restructuring of SOEs,  expansion of private enterprises, inflows of new 
15:475:40954:20:20:71:518:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:investment and technology, and better incentive structures for production decisions all contributed 
15:476:41054:20:20:71:537:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:toward the observed increases in sectoral labor productivity in non-agricultural sectors noted in Section 
15:477:41160:20:20:71:528:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2. These sectoral productivity gains not only directly impacted the gains in aggregate productivity, but 
15:478:41265:20:20:71:533:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:could have in principle also induced labor to move out of agriculture. A griculture started off  with lower 
15:479:41373:20:21:71:536:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor productivity in 1990 and experienced lower subsequent productivity growth than non-agricultural 
15:480:41475:21:20:71:533:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sectors such as manufacturing.  An increase in non-agricultural productivity is predicted to induce rising 
15:481:41582:20:20:71:535:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:wages in the non-agricultural sector, particularly within enterprises, thus inducing workers to move out 
15:482:41687:20:20:71:527:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of agriculture. The magnitude of the contribution of   these “pull” factors relative to the “push” factors 
15:483:41794:20:20:71:528:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for moving workers out of agriculture discussed in the previous subsection remains an open empirical 
15:484:41895:20:0:71:118:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:question.

16:486:41907:13:14:72:207:696:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:3.3. International integration 
16:487:41938:14:20:71:501:682:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Strongly connected to the reforms in agriculture and enterprises was Vietnam’s gradual 
16:488:42025:20:20:71:527:662:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:integration with the global economy. To appreciate the vastness of the reforms undertaken as part of 
16:489:42126:20:20:71:530:642:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:this integration one must appreciate how controlled and closed, in many respects, Vietnam was at the 
16:490:42227:20:20:71:394:622:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:beginning of the Doi Moi period in comparison to its current openness.  
16:491:42299:20:20:71:537:602:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Prior to the reforms foreign trade in Vietnam was subject to central decisions and could only be 
16:492:42396:20:21:72:511:582:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:carried out by a small number of state trading monopolies. Exports were discouraged through the 
16:493:42492:21:20:72:522:561:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:overvaluation of the exchange rate and the use of export duties, imports had to proceed through an 
16:494:42591:20:20:72:538:541:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:extensive system of quotas and licenses, and exports had to fulfill partner obligations within the Council 
16:495:42698:20:20:72:535:521:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for Mutual Economic Assistance before they could be sold to the convertible currency area (Dodsworth 
16:496:42799:20:20:72:532:501:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:et al. 1996). Additionally, Vietnam faced a trade embargo with the United States that was only lifted in 
16:497:42904:20:20:72:377:481:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1994. These restrictions made Vietnam a relatively closed economy. 
16:498:42970:20:20:71:539:461:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: The list of reforms early in Doi Moi is extensive. These include the unification and devaluation of 
16:499:43070:20:21:71:513:441:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the exchange rate in 1989, relaxations on import and export quotas in 1989, eliminating all budget 
16:500:43169:21:20:71:524:420:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:subsidies for exports in 1989, simplification of licensing procedures for import and export shipments, 
16:501:43272:20:20:71:511:400:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:delisting items from export duties and reducing the rates for remaining products in 1989, allowing 
16:502:43371:20:20:71:512:380:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:private enterprises to engage directly in international trade in 1991, and removal of import permit 
16:503:43471:20:20:71:396:360:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:requirements for most remaining items in 1995 (Dodsworth et al. 1996). 
16:504:43541:20:20:71:524:340:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Domestic reforms related to international trade were quickly followed by international trade 
16:505:43634:20:20:71:496:320:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:agreements and partnerships. In 1992 Vietnam signed a preferential trade agreement with the 
16:506:43725:20:21:71:529:300:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:European Economic Community (Glewwe 2004). In 1995 Vietnam became a member of ASEAN and its 
16:507:43817:21:20:71:514:279:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:associated ASEAN Free Trade Area, which bound Vietnam to reduce tariffs on imports from ASEAN 
16:508:43911:20:20:71:540:259:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:members to 5 percent or less by 2006 for the vast majority of goods ( Athukorala 2006). In 1995 Vietnam 
16:509:44015:20:20:71:530:239:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:also initiated the application process to join the World Trade Organization. In December 2001 the U.S.-
16:510:44118:20:20:71:531:219:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement came into effect, leading to a huge increase in Vietnamese exports 
16:511:44219:20:20:71:510:199:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to the U.S., predominantly in light manufactured products such as clothing, textiles, and footwear 
16:512:44318:20:20:71:526:179:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(McCaig 2011). The culminating act was membership in the World Trade Organization in 2007 (World 
16:513:44415:20:20:71:126:159:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Bank 2011). 
16:514:44426:20:21:107:534:139:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The vast array of trade reforms significantly increased the ability of firms to export and import. 
16:515:44525:21:20:71:524:118:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:According to Doing Business 2013 (World Bank 2013) Vietnam ranks better on trading across borders 
16:516:44623:20:20:71:540:98:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:than for overall ease of doing business. It ranks 74 in 2012, just behind China at 68th position. In Vietnam 
16:517:44732:20:0:72:532:78:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:fewer documents are needed to export, but more to import than in China and container costs are very 
17:518:44834:0:20:72:523:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:similar. The trading across borders rankings put Vietnam well ahead of other Asian countries such as 
17:519:44935:20:20:72:321:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Cambodia (118th), Bangladesh (119th), and India (127th). 
17:520:44992:20:20:107:535:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:These policy changes contributed to a dramatic increase in both aggregate exports and imports 
17:521:45086:20:20:71:538:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:as a percentage of GDP. Figure 7 shows the dramatic rise in imports and exports as a percentage of GDP 
17:522:45189:20:20:71:540:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:between 1986 and 2011. In the mid-1980s imports and exports averaged about 15 and 5 percent of GDP 
17:523:45288:20:21:71:519:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:respectively. S tarting in the late 1980s and early 1990s imports and exports both began a rapid and 
17:524:45389:21:20:72:532:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:continuous increase, reaching 88 and 78 percent of GDP by 2010. Between 1990 and 2010 exports and 
17:525:45487:20:20:72:537:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:imports grew in value by an average of 18.5 and 18.7 percent per annum (based on data from the GSO). 
17:526:45587:20:20:108:521:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The trade reforms not only increased the aggregate value of trade and its importance to the 
17:527:45679:20:20:72:529:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:economy, but also affected the composition of trade in two important dimensions: the types of goods 
17:528:45778:20:20:72:541:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:being traded and the ownership of the firms involved in trading. As shown in Figure 8, Vietnam’s exports 
17:529:45883:20:20:72:532:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:shifted significantly away from agricultural and aquaculture   products, such as rice and fish, and crude 
17:530:45989:20:21:72:516:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:petroleum (within mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials) to manufactured exports such as 
17:531:46088:21:20:72:515:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:clothing and footwear (within miscellaneous manufactured products) and office machinery (within 
17:532:46184:20:20:72:533:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:machinery and transport equipment). Primary products exports constituted over 60 percent of exports 
17:533:46284:20:20:72:541:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in 1995, but they had fallen to about 30 percent by 2010. Two major export commodities, rice and crude 
17:534:46387:20:20:72:535:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:petroleum,  account for a large share of the decline in the relative importance of primary exports.8 Data 
17:535:46493:20:20:71:535:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:constraints prevent us from constructing a consistent series stretching further back in time, but Chu Thi

17:537:46700:20:21:71:537:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in 1992. As displayed in Figure 9, the major compositional shift in imports was away from miscellaneous 
17:538:46804:21:20:71:514:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufactured goods, primarily due to a fall in the share of clothing and footwear imports, towards 
17:539:46903:20:20:71:511:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufactured goods classified chiefly by materials, such as iron and steel and non-ferrous metals. 
17:540:47002:20:20:107:535:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The above reforms and changes in the composition of traded products likely contributed to the 
17:541:47096:20:20:71:530:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reallocation of labor from agriculture (including aquaculture) to manufacturing, as agricultural exports 
17:542:47201:20:20:71:530:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:became relatively less important over time. Vietnam dramatically expanded exports of unskilled labor-
17:543:47302:20:20:71:535:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:intensive manufactured goods such as clothing, footwear, and office machinery, which grew at average 
17:544:47403:20:21:71:542:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:annual rates of 16.8, 13.9 and 67.5 percent respectively from 1997 to 2000.9 At the same time, the share 
17:545:47508:21:20:71:529:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of light manufactured goods in imports declined. This expansion of net exports and the changes in the 
17:546:47610:20:22:71:485:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:composition of manufacturing trade likely contributed to increased demand for labor within

17:548:47757:7:17:72:536:116:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:8 Data from the UN Comtrade database suggest that rice (SITC 42) dropped from 9.5 percent of exports in 1997 to 
17:549:47869:17:13:72:515:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:4.5 percent of exports in 2010. Crude petroleum exports (SITC 333) declined from 15.6 to 6.9 of total exports 
17:550:47979:13:7:72:174:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:during the same period.

18:552:48064:0:20:72:511:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing, where employment expanded at an average annual rate of 7.5 percent during this 
18:553:48158:20:20:72:538:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:period and at the same time affected the structure of employment across manufacturing industries. We 
18:554:48259:20:20:71:462:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:more closely examine changes in composition of manufacturing industries in   Section 5. 
18:555:48346:20:20:108:512:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Additionally, the liberalization of foreign investment and SOE reforms noted in Section 3.2 
18:556:48437:20:20:71:523:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:interacted in important ways with trade reforms and affected the composition of ownership of firms 
18:557:48536:20:21:71:539:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:involved in international trade. Foreign-invested firms became responsible for over half of all exports by 
18:558:48643:21:20:71:532:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2010, as compared to only about a quarter of exports in 1995 while imports by foreign firms rose from 
18:559:48745:20:20:71:505:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:18 to 44 percent of total imports between 1995 and 2010.10 Thus, Vietnam’s trade reforms likely 
18:560:48841:20:20:71:513:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:influenced the structure of the workforce across firms of different ownership type. We discuss the 
18:561:48940:20:20:71:541:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:importance of changes in the allocation of labor across firms that might have been differentially affected 
18:562:49047:20:20:71:286:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:by trade and other reforms in the next section.

18:564:49096:20:21:71:305:468:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:4. Labor allocation across firm types within sectors 
18:565:49148:21:20:107:517:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Movements of labor away from agriculture toward services and manufacturing contributed 
18:566:49234:20:20:71:500:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:significantly toward Vietnam’s economic growth during the past two decades. A large literature 
18:567:49329:20:20:71:519:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:emphasizes allocation of labor across heterogeneous firms within sectors as an important source of 
18:568:49428:20:20:71:517:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:aggregate productivity ( see, for example, Hsieh and Klenow 2009,  Melitz 2003, Melitz and Redding

18:570:49617:20:20:71:520:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:improvements noted in Table 1 could in part stem from such reallocation of labor from less to more 
18:571:49716:20:21:71:541:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productive firms within each sector. In this section, we document the extent to   which labor reallocated 
18:572:49822:21:20:71:510:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:across firms types and discuss the potential contribution of this channel to aggregate productivity 
18:573:49922:20:20:71:525:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:growth in Vietnam from 1990 to 2008.    The discussion focuses on two dimensions of labor allocation: 
18:574:50024:20:20:71:533:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the allocation of workers between household businesses and firms in the formal enterprise sector, and 
18:575:50126:20:20:71:468:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the a llocation of labor across SOEs and firms in the private domestic and foreign sector.

18:578:50304:20:21:107:522:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:A large share of workers in low-income countries work for informal household businesses or 
18:579:50395:21:20:71:529:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:farms. The informal sector is usually associated with lower productivity (McMillan and Rodrik 2011, La 
18:580:50498:20:20:71:540:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Porta and Shleifer 2008, McCaig and Pavcnik 2013) and workers employed in the informal sector tend to 
18:581:50600:20:26:71:539:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:earn lower wages than observationally similar workers in the formal sector (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2003,

18:583:50759:8:17:72:520:91:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:10 The data series are “Exports of goods by kind of economic sector and by commodity group” and “Imports of 
18:584:50867:17:0:72:419:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:goods by kind of economic sector and by commodity group” from the GSO’s website. 
19:585:50949:0:20:72:535:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2007). If firms in the formal sector are more productive than firms in the informal sector, a reallocation 
19:586:51056:20:20:71:518:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of labor toward formal firms could in principle contribute toward growth in aggregate productivity.  
19:587:51156:20:20:107:527:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The Vietnamese household surveys conducted between 2002 and 2008 allow for a consistent 
19:588:51244:20:20:71:531:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:definition of informal employment based on the ownership sector in which the individual worked. The 
19:589:51344:20:20:71:528:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:surveys identify whether the individual is self-employed on a household farm or business, working for 
19:590:51446:20:21:71:536:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:another household’s farm or business, or working in the state, collective, private, or foreign sector. Our 
19:591:51553:21:20:71:526:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:definition of household business employment encompasses workers that are either self-employed or 
19:592:51650:20:20:71:527:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:working for another household’s farm or business.11 Firms in the state, collective, private, and foreign 
19:593:51755:20:20:71:492:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sector are registered as an enterprise with the government. H ousehold farms and businesses 
19:594:51847:20:20:71:541:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(henceforth household businesses) are not officially registered with the government as an enterprise. As 
19:595:51952:20:20:71:505:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:such, they are subject to looser regulations on employment conditions for workers. O ur focus on 
19:596:52049:20:20:71:533:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:household businesses thus conforms to an important distinction across different types of businesses in 
19:597:52152:20:21:71:231:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam as per national legislation. 
19:598:52188:21:20:71:495:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: As in many less developed economies, a large share of Vietnam’s labor force works for 
19:599:52274:20:20:71:523:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:household businesses or farms. Table 4   reports household business employment shares in aggregate 
19:600:52373:20:20:71:511:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and in broad sectors of the economy as defined in McMillan and Rodrik (2011) for 2002 and 2008. 
19:601:52469:20:20:71:538:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Despite Vietnam’s rapid growth during the 1990s, the vast majority of workers, 86.3 percent, continued 
19:602:52572:20:20:71:520:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to work for a household business as of 2002.  Sectors differ in the prevalence of household business 
19:603:52673:20:20:71:505:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment. Almost all workers in agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing work for household 
19:604:52770:20:21:71:538:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:businesses.  While rates are lower in other sectors, household business employment exceeds 80 percent 
19:605:52872:21:20:71:541:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in sectors such as wholesale and retail trade, hotels, and restaurants, and in construction and it accounts 
19:606:52980:20:20:71:506:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for 66.7 percent of manufacturing employment in 2002. Vietnam observed a sharp decline of 5.6 
19:607:53074:20:20:71:527:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percentage points in the aggregate share of household business employment by 2008. These declines 
19:608:53172:20:20:71:544:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:were uneven across sectors. V irtually all sectors observed large drops in the share of household business 
19:609:53279:20:20:71:540:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment, but the declines were largest in manufacturing (from 66.7 to 54.4 percent) and mining and 
19:610:53381:20:20:71:490:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:quarrying (from 57.9 to 45 percent). Transport, storage, and communication and utilities also 
19:611:53475:20:21:71:534:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:experienced large drops, while the prevalence of household business employment in agriculture and in 
19:612:53576:21:20:71:382:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:finance, insurance, real estate and business services was unaffected.  
19:613:53646:20:20:71:524:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Declining household business employment in part reflects the structural change in Vietnam’s 
19:614:53738:20:26:71:533:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workforce discussed in Section 2. Between 2002 and 2008, workers tended to move away from sectors 
19:615:53836:26:8:72:219:99:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
19:616:53892:8:17:72:538:91:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:11 T he censuses cannot be used in a similar manner because the required definitions were not consistently applied 
19:617:54007:17:0:71:115:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:over time. 
20:618:54019:0:20:72:535:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:with a high incidence of household business employment such as agriculture toward sectors with lower 
20:619:54120:20:20:72:528:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:prevalence such as manufacturing. This relationship is strongly influenced by the agriculture, hunting, 
20:620:54224:20:20:71:539:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:forestry, and fishing sector which contracted sharply as a share of total employment and features a high 
20:621:54329:20:20:71:514:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:prevalence of employment in household businesses. McCaig and Pavcnik (2013) find that about 50 
20:622:54424:20:20:71:536:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent of the decline in the aggregate share of employment in household businesses in the first half of 
20:623:54529:20:21:71:513:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the 2000s is driven by movements of labor between industries, notably away from agriculture and 
20:624:54625:21:20:71:515:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:aquaculture toward other industries. Their findings are based on a decomposition of the aggregate 
20:625:54723:20:20:71:528:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:decline in household business employment into between-  and within-industry shifts across 60 distinct 
20:626:54825:20:20:71:522:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industries. The remaining half of the decline is driven by the reallocation of workers from household 
20:627:54927:20:20:71:497:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:business to firms in the enterprise sector within an industry.  This latter mechanism could have 
20:628:55024:20:20:71:520:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contributed toward the sectoral productivity increases in sectors such as manufacturing, as noted in 
20:629:55125:20:20:71:536:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Table 1, because household businesses tend to have substantially lower labor productivity than firms in 
20:630:55229:20:21:71:519:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the enterprise sector (McCaig and Pavcnik 2013). The difference in productivity between household 
20:631:55327:21:20:71:537:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:businesses and enterprises persists even when state and foreign enterprises are excluded. For example, 
20:632:55430:20:20:71:531:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:estimates from the 2006 VHLSS suggest that private enterprises report average revenue per worker of 
20:633:55530:20:20:71:532:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:46.3 million dong, while household businesses report average revenue per worker of 17.7 million dong 
20:634:55631:20:20:71:459:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:across all industries and 78.9 and 18.0 million dong respectively within manufacturing. 
20:635:55719:20:20:107:515:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam’s increased access to export markets contributed toward the observed declines in 
20:636:55808:20:20:71:499:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:household business employment within industries. Recent trade theory based on Melitz (2003) 
20:637:55900:20:21:71:515:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:highlights the reallocation of labor toward more productive firms within an industry in response to 
20:638:56000:21:20:71:540:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:declines in trade costs. More generally, if trade increases the opportunity cost of working in a household 
20:639:56107:20:20:71:517:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:business by increasing the relative profitability of firms in the formal enterprise sector, workers are 
20:640:56211:20:20:71:517:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:expected to reallocate away from household businesses toward larger, more formal employers and 
20:641:56306:20:20:71:478:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:these effects are expected to be more pronounced in industries that face increased export 
20:642:56396:20:20:71:530:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:opportunities. McCaig and Pavcnik (2013) find that increased access of Vietnamese exports to the U.S. 
20:643:56498:20:20:71:527:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:markets after the 2001 U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement reduced the probability of household 
20:644:56597:20:21:71:502:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:business employment. T he probability of working for a household business declined the most in 
20:645:56692:21:20:71:539:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnamese industries that experienced the largest U.S. tariff cuts. These declines in household business 
20:646:56798:20:20:71:539:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment were more pronounced for workers in younger cohorts and for workers in provinces closer 
20:647:56897:20:20:71:537:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to major seaports.  Their findings imply that industry tariff cuts on exports in manufacturing can account 
20:648:57004:20:20:71:533:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:for up to 40 percent of the decline in household business employment in manufacturing between 2001 
20:649:57103:20:0:71:492:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and 2003. Increased access to export markets, which disproportionately benefits larger, more 
21:650:57198:0:20:72:531:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productive firms in the enterprise sector, contributed toward the observed increases in manufacturing 
21:651:57299:20:20:72:208:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity during the 2000s.

21:654:57379:20:20:108:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The enterprise reforms discussed in Section 3 exposed SOEs to market competition and eased 
21:655:57470:20:21:72:536:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the entry and growth of private domestic and foreign owned enterprises, setting the stage for potential 
21:656:57574:21:20:72:478:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reallocation of resources such as labor away from SOEs toward firms in the private sector.  
21:657:57666:20:20:108:538:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The Vietnamese census data on employment by broad sectors and ownership type presented in 
21:658:57756:20:20:71:521:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Table 5   shed further light on the process of labor allocation between SOEs and private domestic and 
21:659:57858:20:20:71:502:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:foreign firms over the two decades. At the onset of reforms in 1989, apart from community and 
21:660:57952:20:20:71:526:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:government services (where virtually all employment was in state jobs), employment in SOEs was the 
21:661:58051:20:20:71:504:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:most prevalent form of employment in services such as finance, insurance, real estate and other 
21:662:58147:20:21:71:514:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:business services (88 percent), and construction (68 percent), and was also significant in transport, 
21:663:58249:21:20:71:526:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:storage and communication (48 percent) and manufacturing (37.5 percent). The reforms reduced the 
21:664:58346:20:20:71:536:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:number of workers working for SOEs in absolute number from 4.4 million in 1989 to 3.8 million in 1999. 
21:665:58448:20:20:71:519:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The decline in the absolute number of workers in SOEs occurred in all sectors, with the exception of 
21:666:58549:20:20:71:516:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:community, social, personal and government services and finance, insurance, real estate and other 
21:667:58647:20:20:71:536:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:business services. Overall, the share of the Vietnamese labor force working for SOEs declined from 15.7 
21:668:58751:20:20:71:529:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to 10.7 percent. While all industries observed a shrinking share of SOE employment, the most notable 
21:669:58852:20:21:71:529:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:declines occurred in construction; transport, storage, and communication; and in wholesale and retail 
21:670:58954:21:20:71:213:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:trade, hotels and restaurants.    
21:671:58988:20:20:107:525:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Labor was clearly being reallocated from the SOE sector toward the growing private sector in 
21:672:59081:20:20:71:522:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the decade following the initial reforms. Some of the expansion of the employment in private sector 
21:673:59181:20:20:71:517:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:owes to foreign direct investment. Table 5   documents that while Vietnam attracted employment in 
21:674:59279:20:20:71:537:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:foreign owned firms during the 1990s, the expanding foreign owned sector employed less than 200,000 
21:675:59379:20:20:71:508:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers by 1999 and accounted for less than one percent of the economy-wide workforce. These 
21:676:59472:20:21:71:538:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:aggregate numbers mask differences in exposure to FDI across broad industrial sectors, as 87 percent of 
21:677:59576:21:20:71:526:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the workers in the FDI sector were employed in manufacturing. Manufacturing was the only sector in 
21:678:59675:20:20:71:386:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1999 where employment in foreign owned firms exceeded 5 percent.  
21:679:59741:20:20:107:519:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:While the number of workers in the state sector increased by 1.7 million between 1999 and 
21:680:59831:20:20:71:492:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2009, the state sector was, in aggregate, neither expanding nor contracting as a share of total 
21:681:59927:20:0:71:518:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment during the 2000s, accounting for about 10 percent of overall employment. This mainly 
22:682:60025:0:20:72:540:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reflects the growth of state employment in community, social, personal and government services during 
22:683:60127:20:20:71:531:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2000s. Outside of this sector, the share of SOE employment dropped by 30 percent between 1989 and 
22:684:60225:20:20:71:523:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1999, and by 16 percent between 1999 and 2009. The declines in SOE employment were particularly 
22:685:60321:20:20:71:519:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:pronounced in manufacturing (from 30 to 9 percent), construction (23 to 6 percent), and in finance, 
22:686:60421:20:20:71:526:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:insurance, real estate, and other business services (from 74 to 36 percent) between 1999 and 2009.12 
22:687:60521:20:21:72:530:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:SOE employment actually dropped in absolute number in manufacturing; construction; and wholesale 
22:688:60618:21:20:72:254:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and retail trade, hotels and restaurants.  
22:689:60661:20:20:108:508:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:In the private sector, FDI employment played an increasingly important role in the 2000s. 
22:690:60750:20:20:72:508:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Further expansion of private investment and jobs might have been spurred by implementation of 
22:691:60843:20:20:72:530:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:several additional reforms such as the Domestic Investment and Promotion Law in 1998 and Common 
22:692:60939:20:20:72:531:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Investment Law in 2006.  Table 5   suggests that the number of workers in foreign owned firm increased 
22:693:61042:20:20:72:521:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:by almost 1.5 million during this period, although the share of individuals employed by foreign firms 
22:694:61144:20:21:72:536:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:continues to be low economy-wide (about 3.4 percent in the 2009 census). FDI’s impact was mainly felt 
22:695:61246:21:20:71:516:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:within manufacturing, where foreign owned firms employed 22 percent of workers, and in finance, 
22:696:61342:20:20:71:526:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:insurance, real estate and business services, where foreign firms employed 6.4 percent of workers by 
22:697:61443:20:20:71:509:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2009. No other sector saw its share of workers in foreign-invested firms grow by more than a few 
22:698:61540:20:20:71:157:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percentage points. 
22:699:61558:20:20:107:524:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The observed drastic shift of workers away from SOEs toward private firms, including foreign 
22:700:61651:20:20:71:526:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:owned ones, could have contributed toward aggregate productivity improvements. Firms in the state 
22:701:61749:20:21:71:527:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sector tend to be less productive than private establishments (World Bank 2011). In addition, most of 
22:702:61851:21:20:71:521:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the closed or merged SOEs were smaller, less productive, and non-profitable (Tuan et al. 1996). As a 
22:703:61952:20:20:71:496:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:result, reallocation of labor away from SOEs toward private or foreign owned firms might have 
22:704:62046:20:20:71:474:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contributed toward the growth in sectoral productivity noted in Table 1 in sectors such as 
22:705:62137:20:20:71:538:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing; wholesale and retail trade, hotels, and restaurants; and construction, as workers moved 
22:706:62240:20:20:71:254:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:from lower to higher productivity firms.  
22:707:62282:20:20:107:490:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:However, a recent report by the World Bank (2011) indicates that the process of SOE 
22:708:62366:20:21:71:530:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:restructuring has slowed down between 2005 and 2009. SOEs now employ less than 10 percent of the 
22:709:62463:21:20:71:541:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workforce, but they remain an important sector in terms of production, accounting for about 35 percent 
22:710:62566:20:22:71:529:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of GDP in 2009. The state sector still has a virtual monopoly on production in sectors such as fertilizer, 
22:711:62673:22:7:72:219:123:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
22:712:62729:7:17:72:534:116:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:12 S ome of the reductions in state employment might reflect the formation of joint ventures with foreign firms, in 
22:713:62845:17:13:72:532:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:which case the firm would become classified as a foreign-invested firm. Thus, the reduction in state employment 
22:714:62957:13:12:71:541:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:may not translate one to one into job losses. Nonetheless, these reductions show the declining importance of state 
22:715:63072:12:0:71:97:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:firms. 
23:716:63080:0:20:72:539:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:coal, electricity and gas, telecommunications, water supply, and insurance (World Bank 2011). The state 
23:717:63184:20:20:72:509:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sector also tends to have better access to capital and land markets, receiving about 27 percent of 
23:718:63283:20:20:72:522:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:domestic credit in 2009, and capital accumulation among the SOEs has accelerated during the 2000s 
23:719:63381:20:20:72:508:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(World Bank 2011). Capital accumulation has not translated into disproportionately greater labor 
23:720:63478:20:20:72:486:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity, so the labor productivity of SOE firms lags relative to private enterprises. These 
23:721:63575:20:21:72:511:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:observations suggest that Vietnam could further increase aggregate productivity by either further 
23:722:63673:21:20:72:532:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:implementation of reforms in the SOE sector or reallocation of resources, especially capital, from SOEs 
23:723:63777:20:20:72:171:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:to the private sector.

23:726:63863:20:20:108:521:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The manufacturing sector observed a large expansion of employment and output during the 
23:727:63951:20:20:72:532:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:past two decades. What manufacturing industries contributed toward the expansion of manufacturing 
23:728:64049:20:21:72:540:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment from 8 to 14 percent of the Vietnamese workforce between 1990 and 2008 noted in Figure

23:730:64243:20:20:71:519:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnamese census data provides further insights on this process during the 2000s. Data constraints 
23:731:64343:20:20:71:237:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:preclude this analysis for the 1990s.  
23:732:64382:20:20:71:530:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Table 6   reports the estimated number of workers across 23 manufacturing industries for 1999 
23:733:64476:20:20:71:533:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:and 2009. Four industries employed 61   percent of manufacturing workers in Vietnam in 1999. Clothing 
23:734:64578:20:20:71:534:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:accounted for 25 percent of manufacturing employment, followed by food products and beverages (16 
23:735:64676:20:21:71:345:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent), furniture (12 percent), and footwear (8 percent).13  
23:736:64739:21:20:107:530:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:During this decade manufacturing employment grew at an average annual rate of 7.5 percent, 
23:737:64830:20:20:71:517:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:absorbing about 3.3 million workers. The differences in employment growth rates across industries 
23:738:64928:20:20:72:535:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:noted in Table 6 have somewhat influenced the composition of employment within manufacturing, but 
23:739:65026:20:20:71:525:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the vast majority of manufacturing jobs were added in the initially largest industries.  The four largest 
23:740:65132:20:20:71:483:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industries expanded the most in terms of number of employees and continued to dominate 
23:741:65219:20:20:71:530:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing employment. These are all industries in which Vietnam,  as a relatively less-skilled labor 
23:742:65324:20:26:71:529:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:abundant country,  has a comparative advantage, and indeed Vietnam exports significant quantities of 
23:743:65425:26:7:72:219:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
23:744:65481:7:18:72:497:153:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:13 Employment in the furniture industry also includes manufacturing n.e.c. (industry 36 in ISIC revision 3) 
23:745:65589:18:12:71:539:135:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:Employment in furniture accounts for 81 percent of total employment in the industry based on estimates from the 
23:746:65701:12:12:71:529:123:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:1999 census and thus for brevity we simply refer to this industry as furniture. Similarly, employment in footwear 
23:747:65815:12:12:71:535:111:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:also includes employment in tanning and dressing of leather and manufacturing luggage, handbags, saddlery, and 
23:748:65926:12:13:71:526:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:harnesses (industry 19 in ISIC revision 3) but employment in footwear is the dominant component at 88 of total 
23:749:66037:13:12:71:541:86:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:employment in the industry according to estimates from the 1999 census.  We thus we simply refer to this industry 
23:750:66151:12:0:71:124:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:as footwear. 
24:751:66165:0:20:72:502:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:clothing, footwear, and furniture. For example, almost 600,000 new workers joined the clothing 
24:752:66259:20:20:72:520:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industry, accounting for 18 percent of the total growth in manufacturing employment. Vietnam also 
24:753:66357:20:20:71:478:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:appears to be transitioning into industries that traditionally did not account for much of its 
24:754:66452:20:20:71:501:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing labor force. Some initially very small industries experienced very rapid growth in 
24:755:66549:20:20:71:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment. These include motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; other transport equipment; and 
24:756:66650:20:21:72:533:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus. E mployment in office, accounting and 
24:757:66749:21:20:71:537:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:computing machinery grew at an astounding average annual rate of 33.7 percent, although the industry 
24:758:66849:20:20:71:539:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:still accounts for a relatively small share of total manufacturing employment at just 0.3 percent in 2009.  
24:759:66956:20:20:71:541:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Much of this employment expansion occurred in the officially registered enterprises that tend to 
24:760:67053:20:20:71:521:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:be substantially larger and have higher labor productivity than non-registered household businesses 
24:761:67153:20:20:71:537:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(McCaig and Pavcnik 2013). The right side of Table 6   provides estimates of the number of employees, at 
24:762:67258:20:20:71:520:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:year end for 2000 and 2008,  using the enterprise surveys, which only cover employment in officially 
24:763:67359:20:21:71:512:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:registered enterprises.14 Registered manufacturing sector employment added 2.3 million workers, 
24:764:67455:21:20:71:538:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:representing an average annual growth of 12   percent. The registered sector observes similar patterns in 
24:765:67561:20:20:71:521:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment expansion as the overall manufacturing sector, highlighting the dominant role of larger 
24:766:67660:20:20:71:513:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:firms in manufacturing expansion. The initially largest industries, such as clothing, experienced the 
24:767:67762:20:20:71:496:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:largest increases in the number of workers, but some initially smaller industries, such as office, 
24:768:67861:20:20:71:531:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:accounting and computing machinery, experienced faster growth rates. Clothing was a very important 
24:769:67960:20:20:71:530:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industry for employment growth as it added about 525,000 workers during this period, accounting for 
24:770:68060:20:21:71:521:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:over one fifth of total employment growth in the formal manufacturing sector. Other industries that 
24:771:68160:21:20:71:518:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:experienced large expansions in absolute terms include footwear, furniture,  and food products and 
24:772:68259:20:20:71:533:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:beverages, as they all added over 200,000 employees over these eight years. I n terms of growth rates, 
24:773:68362:20:20:71:526:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the fastest growth was observed in office, accounting and computing machinery and furniture, which 
24:774:68461:20:20:71:377:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:both experienced average annual growth rates above 20 percent.15  
24:775:68527:20:20:108:539:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The observed changes in the structure of employment across manufacturing industries relate to 
24:776:68621:20:20:71:531:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:changes in the relative importance of SOE employment and FDI employment within an industry during 
24:777:68719:20:26:71:524:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the 2000s. Industries that observed the biggest declines in the share of state sector employment and 
24:778:68820:26:7:72:219:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
24:779:68876:7:18:72:518:153:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:14 The household surveys used in Section 4.1 also collect information on whether the individual worked for an 
24:780:68986:18:12:72:512:135:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:enterprise. These unreported estimates are very similar to those from the enterprise data. For example, the 
24:781:69094:12:12:72:525:123:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:employment shares are highly correlated: 0.971 using the 2001 enterprise data and the 2002 household survey 
24:782:69202:12:12:72:541:111:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:data and 0.963 using the 2005 enterprise data and the 2006 household survey data. Thus, both data sources depict 
24:783:69315:12:8:72:360:99:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:broadly similar employment patterns among officially registered firms. 
24:784:69385:8:17:72:541:91:42:Times:99:g_d0_f1:15 Recycling also grew at an average annual rate above 20 percent, but it started from an extremely small base, just 
24:785:69501:17:0:72:170:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:Times:a few hundred workers. 
25:786:69525:0:20:72:531:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:biggest increases in the share of FDI employment expanded relative to other manufacturing industries 
25:787:69626:20:20:72:534:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:between 1999 and 2009. These patterns in relative employment changes are documented in Figure 10, 
25:788:69724:20:20:72:529:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:which plots the change in an industry’s share of manufacturing employment against the prevalence of 
25:789:69824:20:20:72:522:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:SOE jobs and Figure 11, which plots the change in an industry’s share of manufacturing employment 
25:790:69922:20:20:72:535:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:against the change in the prevalence of FDI jobs. The correlation between 1999 and 2009 in the change 
25:791:70024:20:21:71:540:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in the share of workers within an industry working for a state firm and the change in the industry’s share 
25:792:70131:21:20:71:536:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of manufacturing employment is -0.26. B etween 1999 and 2009 the correlation between the change in 
25:793:70230:20:20:71:528:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:an industry’s share of manufacturing employment and the change in the share of workers in FDI firms 
25:794:70330:20:20:71:515:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:within an industry is 0.18. These relationships suggest that either foreign investors have selectively 
25:795:70433:20:20:71:522:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:targeted sectors with the greatest employment growth potential or that these sectors grew because 
25:796:70531:20:20:71:209:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:they attracted foreign capital.

25:798:70564:20:21:71:341:468:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:6. Vietnam’s structural change in international perspective 
25:799:70623:21:20:107:506:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Structural change contributed positively toward aggregate productivity improvements in 
25:800:70710:20:20:71:517:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam. Domestic reforms in agriculture, the enterprise sector, and international integration likely 
25:801:70811:20:20:71:501:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:played an important role in this process. How does Vietnam’s experience compare to other less 
25:802:70905:20:20:71:536:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:developed economies during the last two decades? McMillan and Rodrik (2011) noted heterogeneity in 
25:803:71004:20:20:71:505:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the impact of labor reallocation across sectors on aggregate growth: structural change increased 
25:804:71101:20:20:71:541:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:aggregate productivity in Asian countries but decreased it in Latin American and African countries within 
25:805:71207:20:21:71:539:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:their sample. Reallocation of labor across sectors tended to enhance aggregate productivity in countries 
25:806:71312:21:20:71:510:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:with a comparative disadvantage in natural resources, an undervalued exchange rate, and a more 
25:807:71407:20:20:71:172:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:flexible labor market.  
25:808:71431:20:20:107:532:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:We briefly compare Vietnam’s growth experience to other countries of similar initial economic 
25:809:71525:20:20:71:520:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:development in 1990 and discuss the potential role of the factors identified by McMillan and Rodrik 
25:810:71625:20:20:71:526:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(2011) in enhancing Vietnam’s ability to expand its manufacturing and service sector relative to other 
25:811:71728:20:20:71:513:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:low-income countries.  Figure 12 plots GDP per capita in 1990 and 2010 for countries with GDP per 
25:812:71826:20:21:71:516:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:capita within $300 of Vietnam’s GDP per capita of $900 (in 2005 PPP prices) in 1990.  This grouping 
25:813:71926:21:20:71:536:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:predominately includes countries in Africa (such as Zambia (ZMB), Lesotho (LSO), Kenya (KEN)) and Asia 
25:814:72029:20:20:71:501:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(such as Cambodia (KHM), China (CHN), Laos (LAO)). The figure illustrates Vietnam’s remarkable 
25:815:72124:20:20:71:529:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:economic growth between 1990 and 2010. Within this country grouping, Vietnam (VNM) moved from 
25:816:72218:20:20:71:527:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the middle of the pack to the fourth richest country, trailing only Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH), China 
25:817:72322:20:0:71:238:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:(CHN) and Equatorial Guinea (GNQ).  
26:818:72360:0:20:108:523:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:As discussed in Section 2,  slightly more than a third of Vietnam’s growth can be attributed to 
26:819:72456:20:20:71:508:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:structural change induced by movements of labor from low productivity agriculture toward more 
26:820:72550:20:20:71:539:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productive manufacturing and services. The relatively large contribution of structural change in Vietnam 
26:821:72654:20:20:71:510:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:may in part owe to Vietnam’s high initial concentration of workers in low productivity agricultural 
26:822:72754:20:20:71:525:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:activities. Figure 13 plots the percentage of employment in agriculture against GDP per capita for the 
26:823:72857:20:21:71:505:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:same set of countries as in Figure 12. Even among this group of low-income countries, Vietnam’s 
26:824:72953:21:20:71:544:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workforce is more agrarian than would be predicted based on its initial level of income.  However, the 20 
26:825:73059:20:20:71:526:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percentage point drop in the share of agricultural employment in Vietnam between 1990 and 2008 is 
26:826:73157:20:20:71:531:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:not solely due to the initially highly agrarian nature of Vietnam’s economy.  Many other highly agrarian 
26:827:73262:20:20:71:544:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:countries in the sample experienced a much slower reallocation of workers out of agriculture a nd slower 
26:828:73367:20:20:71:541:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:overall economic growth.  For example, the share of workers in agriculture dropped by only 4 percentage 
26:829:73471:20:20:71:541:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:points between 1994 and 2005 in Burkina Faso (BFA) and by only 8 percentage points between 1991 and 
26:830:73571:20:21:71:533:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2006 in Tanzania (TZA).  Both countries also experienced notably slower growth than Vietnam between 
26:831:73671:21:20:71:516:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1990 and 2010 (Figure 12).  Thus not all initially agrarian economies necessarily experience the fast 
26:832:73773:20:20:71:368:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:movement of workers out of agriculture experienced in Vietnam.  
26:833:73835:20:20:107:540:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The discussion in previous sections suggests that in Vietnam workers leaving agriculture and less 
26:834:73933:20:20:71:480:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productive employers are fairly quickly absorbed into more productive sectors and firms in 
26:835:74024:20:20:71:491:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing and services.  The expansion of manufacturing employment owes to Vietnam’s 
26:836:74113:20:20:71:515:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing industries rather than in natural resource 
26:837:74211:20:21:71:511:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sectors, which tend to be more capital intensive and appear to deter growth-enhancing structural 
26:838:74308:21:20:71:523:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:change (McMillan and Rodrik 2011). As noted in Sections 3.3, 4 and 5, labor-intensive manufacturing 
26:839:74408:20:20:71:520:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:industries accounted for an increasing share of Vietnam’s exports during the 1990s and 2000s, were 
26:840:74507:20:20:71:529:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:important recipients of foreign direct investment during the 2000s, and accounted for a large share of 
26:841:74610:20:20:71:537:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam’s employment expansion during the 2000s.  Vietnam’s export performance also benefited from 
26:842:74709:20:20:71:525:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:relatively lower administrative barriers to trade (for example measured by the number of documents 
26:843:74808:20:20:71:536:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:needed to export, lowest domestic costs of exporting) than comparison countries such as Zambia, Laos,

26:845:74941:21:20:107:534:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam’s traded sector also benefited from the undervalued exchange rate, which tends to be 
26:846:75033:20:20:71:527:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:positively associated with structural change (McMillan and Rodrik 2011). Figure 14 plots a measure of 
26:847:75135:20:20:71:542:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:exchange rate undervaluation from Rodrik (2008) against initial GDP per capita. Vietnam’s exchange rate 
26:848:75239:20:0:71:523:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:is significantly undervalued (a positive value indicates undervaluation) and well above the trend line, 
27:849:75345:0:20:72:518:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:suggesting that Vietnam was ranked high in terms of its competitiveness relative to the comparison 
27:850:75444:20:20:72:129:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:countries.16  
27:851:75458:20:20:107:515:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam also appears to have more flexible labor markets than most other countries in the 
27:852:75547:20:20:71:518:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:comparison group.  Figure 15 displays the relationship between labor market rigidity (a higher index 
27:853:75648:20:20:71:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:number corresponds to higher rigidity) and initial GDP per capita. Vietnam has relatively more flexible 
27:854:75752:20:21:71:538:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:labor markets among this group of low-income countries, similar to China (CHN), and more flexible than 
27:855:75854:21:20:71:499:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Zambia (ZMB).  Based on data from the World Development Indicators database, Vietnam has a 
27:856:75945:20:20:71:539:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:relatively more educated labor force (90 percent literacy rate) versus around 70 percent literacy rates in 
27:857:76052:20:20:71:519:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Laos (LAO), Madagascar (MDG), and Zambia (ZMB) and this might further contribute toward a more 
27:858:76147:20:20:71:398:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:rapid transition of labor toward more productive sectors and employers. 
27:859:76218:20:20:107:527:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Although this analysis is purely descriptive, it seems that relative to other initially low-income 
27:860:76317:20:20:71:526:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:countries Vietnam possesses characteristics that tend to be associated with a positive contribution of 
27:861:76420:20:21:71:539:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:structural change to aggregate productivity growth (McMillan and Rodrik 2011): comparative advantage 
27:862:76521:21:20:71:535:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:in labor-intensive manufacturing, low trade costs, significantly undervalued currency, and flexible labor 
27:863:76627:20:20:71:515:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:markets. This brief discussion suggests that these factors might help to account for a relatively fast 
27:864:76730:20:20:71:536:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:transition of labor toward more productive sectors and employers and subsequent aggregate growth in 
27:865:76830:20:20:71:324:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnam relative to other initially low-income countries.

27:868:76901:20:21:71:492:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Vietnam, like most less developed countries studied in McMillan and Rodrik (2011), is 
27:869:76987:21:20:71:478:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:characterized by large productivity gaps across sectors, especially between agriculture and 
27:870:77079:20:20:71:530:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing and some services. During the 1990s   and 2000s Vietnamese workers moved out of low-
27:871:77177:20:20:71:527:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity agriculture toward higher-productivity manufacturing and services. These movements of 
27:872:77276:20:20:71:540:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers from less to more productive sectors accounted for more than a third of the average annual 5.1 
27:873:77379:20:20:71:504:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percent aggregate productivity growth during this period.  An analysis that focused solely on the 
27:874:77477:20:20:71:506:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing sector would miss this important role of economy-wide worker reallocation when 
27:875:77570:20:21:71:531:186:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:assessing the sources of aggregate labor productivity growth in Vietnam.  Our discussion suggests that 
27:876:77673:21:20:71:528:165:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:reforms in agriculture, the enterprise sector, and international integration all likely contributed to the 
27:877:77780:20:46:71:406:145:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:movement of labor out of agriculture toward manufacturing and services.

27:879:77909:8:17:72:541:91:42:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:16 Bems and Johnson (2012) show that Vietnam’s real effective exchange rate that takes into account its position in 
27:880:78025:17:0:71:444:74:99:g_d0_f1:99:g_d0_f1:global production chains is less undervalued that the conventional exchange rate measure.  
28:881:78118:0:20:72:527:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Vietnam’s aggregate labor productivity growth also owes to improved   sectoral productivities. 
28:882:78213:20:20:71:515:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Resource reallocation from less to more productive firms within sectors in part contributed toward 
28:883:78312:20:20:71:536:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:these sectoral labor productivity improvements, as workers reallocated from less productive household 
28:884:78414:20:20:71:520:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:businesses toward more productive registered firms in the enterprise sector, and from SOEs toward 
28:885:78512:20:20:71:344:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:more productive private domestic and foreign owned firms.  
28:886:78571:20:21:107:525:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Manufacturing stands out as a sector that experienced a large increase in productivity during 
28:887:78665:21:20:71:533:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:this period, averaging an annual growth rate in labor productivity of 5.1 percent, and a large expansion 
28:888:78770:20:20:71:498:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of   its employment base at an annual growth rate of 7 percent.  Manufacturing observed a large 
28:889:78866:20:20:71:539:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:expansion of exports and a growing presence of foreign owned enterprises during the 2000s. In general, 
28:890:78969:20:20:71:538:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:relative employment tended to expand in manufacturing industries with greater declines in the share of 
28:891:79072:20:20:71:408:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment in SOEs and a greater inflow of employment to foreign firms.  
28:892:79145:20:20:71:531:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Despite Vietnam’s substantial economic reforms and subsequent labor reallocation across and 
28:893:79237:20:21:71:540:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:within sectors, large productivity gaps remain both between and within sectors. Reports point to lagging 
28:894:79342:21:20:71:528:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:productivity performance of the SOE sector, accompanied by preferential access of SOEs to credit and 
28:895:79443:20:20:71:534:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:capital markets (The McKinsey Global Institute 2012, World Bank 2011).  Our own research emphasizes 
28:896:79542:20:20:71:537:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the potential importance of further reallocation of resources from the household business sector to the 
28:897:79646:20:20:71:516:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enterprise sector. Although employment in household businesses dropped substantially during the 
28:898:79742:20:20:71:526:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2000s, it continues to account for 80 percent of economy-wide jobs and 54 percent of manufacturing 
28:899:79841:20:20:71:528:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment in 2008. Estimates from the 2006 VHLSS suggest substantially lower labor productivity in 
28:900:79941:20:21:71:494:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:household businesses than in private enterprises.  The movement of workers out of household 
28:901:80033:21:20:71:519:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:businesses into firms in the enterprise sector could either be accomplished through workers leaving 
28:902:80133:20:20:71:506:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:household businesses to join firms operating in the enterprise sector or by household businesses 
28:903:80230:20:20:71:536:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:registering as enterprises. Existing evidence in McCaig and Pavcnik (2013a, 2013b) suggests that growth 
28:904:80334:20:20:71:520:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:of firms in the enterprise sector, as opposed to new registration of existing household businesses, is 
28:905:80437:20:20:71:466:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:more likely to lead to the reallocation of labor away from low to high productivity firms.

29:912:80602:20:20:107:531:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The analysis in Section 2   uses data on employment, gross domestic product  (in constant 1994 
29:913:80697:20:20:71:529:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:prices), and labor productivity (also in constant 1994 prices) disaggregated into economic sectors. Our 
29:914:80801:20:21:71:434:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:source of data is from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), available at 
29:915:80885:21:20:71:540:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:http://www.gso.gov.vn/.  The GSO provides data on employment and gross domestic products in current 
29:916:80985:20:20:72:539:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:Vietnamese Dong and 1994 Dong disaggregated into nineteen economic activities.  We categorize these 
29:917:81085:20:20:71:499:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:nineteen activities into the sectors used by McMillian and Rodrik (2011), as shown in Table A.1. 
29:918:81182:20:20:108:511:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:The employment series shows a break in trend between 2002 and 2003. For example, the 
29:919:81267:20:20:71:534:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:percentage of workers employed in agriculture fell by 5.9 percentage points as compared to by 1.1 and 
29:920:81369:20:20:71:510:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1.5 percentage points between 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and 2004 respectively. We thus omit the 
29:921:81462:20:21:71:540:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:decomposition between 2002 and 2003 in decomposition of productivity growth in Figure 3. Despite the 
29:922:81563:21:20:71:529:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:apparent change in estimation procedure used in the GSO employment data between 2002 and 2003, 
29:923:81658:20:20:71:481:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:the overall employment trends are very consistent with those estimated using census data.

29:926:81769:20:20:71:537:367:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Samples of the 1989, 1999, and 2009 population censuses are publicly available through IPUMS-
29:927:81862:20:20:71:527:347:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:International. Each census asked individuals some basic questions related to their working status. The 
29:928:81965:20:21:71:518:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:1989 census provides the industry of affiliation at a relatively aggregate level whereas the 1999 and 
29:929:82067:21:20:71:541:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2009 census industry codes are adaptations based on three-digit ISIC revision 3 and ISIC revision 4. Thus, 
29:930:82174:20:20:71:513:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:while we can use the 1999 and 2009 censuses to look at the growth of employment within various 
29:931:82269:20:20:71:525:266:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:manufacturing industries we cannot use the 1989 census for this purpose. However, the 1989 census 
29:932:82366:20:20:71:538:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:can be used for verifying the aggregate trends described in Section 2. Additionally, the censuses contain 
29:933:82472:20:20:71:497:226:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:information on the type of ownership (e.g., self-employed, working for the state, etc.) for each 
29:934:82569:20:20:71:491:206:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employee, which we use for looking at the changing role of state owned and foreign-invested

29:938:82693:20:20:71:527:125:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: We use four nationally representative household surveys conducted in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 
29:939:82784:20:20:71:504:105:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2008. The GSO conducted these surveys with technical advice from the World Bank. Each survey 
29:940:82877:20:0:71:490:85:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:contained modules on education, health, income and production activities, expenditures and 
30:941:82970:0:20:72:509:709:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:employment. The employment modules collected information on the industry of affiliation, wage 
30:942:83064:20:20:72:522:689:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:payments if applicable, and the type of ownership for the individual’s primary job during the past 12 
30:943:83166:20:20:72:537:669:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:months. Although the surveys also collected information on additional jobs, we restrict our focus to the 
30:944:83271:20:20:72:534:649:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:individual’s primary job. Like the censuses, the surveys use industry codes based on adaptations of ISIC 
30:945:83376:20:20:72:541:629:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:revisions 3 and 4 and are available at the two digit level. The ownership variable includes information on 
30:946:83483:20:21:71:541:609:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:whether the individual was self-employed, working for another household, working in the formal private 
30:947:83586:21:20:71:532:588:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:sector, working in a collective, working in the state sector, or working in the foreign-invested sector. In 
30:948:83694:20:20:71:517:568:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:our analysis on informality we make use of the ownership sector to define informal employment as 
30:949:83791:20:20:71:527:548:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:being either self-employed or working for another household. One caveat to this definition is that the 
30:950:83894:20:20:71:542:528:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:2002 household survey did not distinguish between self-employment in a household business versus in a 
30:951:83996:20:20:71:514:508:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:private enterprise whereas the latter three surveys did. Thus, our estimate of informality is a slight 
30:952:84099:20:20:71:526:488:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:overestimate since we include all self-employment as informal, even those self-employed in a private 
30:953:84199:20:21:71:509:468:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enterprise. The subsequent surveys demonstrate that this leads to only a slight overestimate. For 
30:954:84297:21:20:71:538:447:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:example, in 2004 we estimate that 83.1 percent of workers were working informally. Removing workers 
30:955:84397:20:20:71:536:427:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:that are self-employed in private enterprises reduces this to 82.7 percent. Thus including self-employed 
30:956:84502:20:20:71:521:407:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:workers in private enterprises will not significantly alter our results and allows us to use a consistent 
30:957:84608:20:20:71:452:387:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:definition across all of the household surveys and thus have a longer period to study.

30:960:84715:20:21:71:504:327:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1: Beginning in 2000 the GSO has been conducting annual surveys of all formally registered 
30:961:84803:21:20:71:512:306:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enterprises in the country. Basic information, such as industry and employment, is collected for all 
30:962:84904:20:20:71:534:286:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:enterprises regardless of the size or the sector. We use information on the industry of the firm (we rely

30:964:85114:20:20:71:531:246:122:g_d0_f1:122:g_d0_f1:codes are based on an adaptation of ISIC revision 3 and thus are easily matched with information from
