2:30:1537:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Approximately 1-in-7 people and 1-in-4 children received benefits from the US Supplemental Nutrition
2:31:1637:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:Assistance Program (SNAP) in July 2011, both all-time highs. We analyze changes in SNAP take-up
2:32:1732:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:over the past two decades. From 1994 to 2001, coincident with welfare reform, take-up fell from 75%
2:33:1831:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:to 54% of eligible people. The take-up rate then rebounded, and, following several policy changes
2:34:1928:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:to improve program access, stabilized at 69% in 2007. Finally, take-up and enrollment rose dramatically
2:35:2031:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:in the Great Recession, with take-up reaching 87% in 2011. We find that changes in local unemployment
2:36:2132:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:can explain at least two-thirds of the increase in enrollment from 2007 to 2011. Increased state adoption
2:37:2237:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:of relaxed income and asset thresholds and temporary changes in program rules for childless adults
2:38:2335:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:explain 18% of the increase. Total SNAP spending today is 6% higher than it would be without these
2:39:2433:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:increases in eligibility. The recession-era increase in benefit levels is also likely to have increased
2:40:2536:14:42:72:127:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:enrollment.

3:52:2751:34:18:125:504:638:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In July 2011, 45.3 million people were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutri-
3:53:2825:18:18:108:504:620:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tion Assistance Program (SNAP), fifteen percent of the US population.2This
3:54:2899:18:17:108:504:602:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:is a sharp increase from 26.6 million and nine percent of the population in
3:55:2974:17:18:108:504:585:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:July 2007. There has been considerable debate about the growth in SNAP
3:56:3044:18:18:108:504:567:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment in the aftermath of the recession. Researchers at the US Depart-

3:58:3191:18:18:108:504:531:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:annual time series evidence and concluded that the increase in unemployment
3:59:3266:18:18:108:504:513:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rates can explain most of the growth, while Mulligan (2012) finds that changes
3:60:3344:18:18:108:504:495:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in SNAP policies played a central role. In this paper, we attempt to explain
3:61:3420:18:18:108:504:477:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:trends in SNAP enrollment over the past twenty years, and bring new data to
3:62:3495:18:27:108:368:459:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bear on the debate over current SNAP enrollment.

3:64:3617:18:18:108:504:414:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and the SNAP take-up rate. Because household income is volatile and not

3:66:3765:18:17:108:503:378:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:surveys, it is quite difficult to estimate the number of people who are eligible
3:67:3845:17:18:108:504:361:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for SNAP at a point in time.  Mathematica Policy Research (Eslami et al.

3:71:4132:18:18:108:504:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:work requirements.3Changes in estimated take-up closely track changes in the
3:72:4208:18:18:108:504:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the population enrolled in SNAP. Take-up fell from 75% in 1994
3:73:4281:18:18:108:504:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to 54% in 2001. It then rebounded up to 69% in 2006. Enrollment and take-
3:74:4354:18:16:108:504:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:up then remained stable through 2008. Finally, take-up rose significantly in

3:76:4511:16:12:108:504:203:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:“Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” We use SNAP throughout the paper to refer
3:77:4597:12:8:108:293:191:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:to this program, regardless of time period.

3:80:4811:12:12:108:504:155:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:time in their methodology. We attempt to construct a consistent time series by splicing
3:81:4898:12:12:108:504:143:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:together the Mathematica estimates. See notes to Figure 1 for details on how we construct

4:86:5278:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the take-up rate to organize our analysis into three periods: Welfare Reform,
4:87:5355:18:28:108:370:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Bush-Era Modernization, and the Great Recession.
4:88:5403:28:18:125:503:608:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In 1992, Oregon was the first state approved for a major waiver from the
4:89:5475:18:18:108:503:590:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:federal government to modify its cash assistance program.4Over the next
4:90:5546:18:18:108:504:572:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:few years, 36 additional states received waivers, culminating in the passage of
4:91:5625:18:18:108:504:554:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:federal welfare reform in 1996. Cash assistance receipt declined dramatically,
4:92:5703:18:18:108:504:536:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from 14.0 million individuals in 1994 to 5.6 million in 2000; SNAP receipt
4:93:5777:18:18:108:504:518:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:among families with children, as well as among adults who were newly sub-
4:94:5850:18:18:108:504:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:jected to SNAP time limits by federal welfare reform, declined concurrently.
4:95:5926:18:18:108:504:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:We demonstrate that states with bigger declines in cash assistance receipt had
4:96:6004:18:17:108:504:464:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bigger declines in SNAP receipt among families with children. We further show
4:97:6081:17:18:108:504:447:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that the change in SNAP enrollment for families with single mothers over this
4:98:6158:18:18:108:504:429:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:period can be decomposed into to two equally important factors. First, there
4:99:6234:18:18:108:504:411:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:was a decrease in the number of eligible individuals because of rising incomes.
4:100:6313:18:18:108:504:393:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Second, among eligible individuals, there was an increase in the fraction of
4:101:6389:18:18:108:504:375:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:individuals with significant earnings and there has historically been a much
4:102:6465:18:28:108:460:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:lower take-up rate of SNAP benefits among people who are working.
4:103:6530:28:18:125:503:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Beginning in 2001, with encouragement from USDA, states implemented

4:105:6658:18:18:108:504:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:families. States relaxed vehicle ownership rules, redesigned income reporting
4:106:6735:18:18:108:504:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:requirements, and promoted phone interviews in lieu of face-to-face interviews
4:107:6813:18:18:108:504:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for establishing and maintaining eligibility. Enrollment rose, even as the un-
4:108:6891:18:18:108:504:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:employment rate was falling, and the program became more dynamic, with
4:109:6961:18:17:108:504:221:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more people entering and exiting SNAP. In addition, we find evidence of a
4:110:7034:17:18:108:503:204:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:“bounceback” from welfare reform – states with biggerdeclinesin cash assis-

5:117:7465:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:an “automatic stabilizer,” rising directly in response to unemployment, or as
5:118:7542:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a deliberate fiscal policy response to the recession. There is a wide consensus
5:119:7621:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:among economists that automatic stabilizers are good policy for responding
5:120:7695:18:18:108:504:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to business cycle changes, while there is disagreement over the usefulness of

5:126:8089:18:18:108:504:481:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:using county-level data, we find that local area unemployment can explain
5:127:8162:18:18:108:504:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:between 71% and 98% of the increase in SNAP enrollment, depending on the

5:130:8321:18:18:108:504:398:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:may also have increased SNAP enrollment during the recession years.  We
5:131:8392:18:18:108:504:380:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:find that states’ adoption of relaxed income and asset limits (“Broad Based

5:133:8548:18:18:108:504:344:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:period. Another feature of SNAP is that program rules for Able-Bodied Adults

5:135:8695:18:18:108:504:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment. Expanded eligibility for ABAWDs during the recession can
5:136:8765:18:18:108:504:290:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:explain 10% of the increase in enrollment. We repeat the exercise for spending
5:137:8843:18:17:108:504:272:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and find that BBCE and ABAWD changes are responsible for 3% and 9%

5:141:9161:12:12:108:504:215:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:– progressive tax-and-transfer schedules, which have permanent fiscal costs and incentive

5:143:9336:12:12:108:504:191:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:“more promising.” Blundell and Pistaferri (2003) and Gundersen and Ziliak (2003) estimate
5:144:9425:12:12:108:504:179:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the consumption insurance provided by SNAP, which fits Blanchard’s first type of automatic

5:146:9603:12:12:108:504:155:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:with Blanchard’s second type of stabilizer. In other recent work, McKay and Reis (2013)
5:147:9690:12:8:108:404:143:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:argue that SNAP is particularly effective as an automatic stabilizer.

6:162:10605:29:18:125:503:419:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:SNAP helps low-income people buy food. A household unit is people who
6:163:10674:18:18:108:504:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:“purchase and prepare food together.” Eligibility is typically determined by
6:164:10750:18:36:108:165:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:three tests:
6:165:10762:36:18:125:504:347:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•gross income test – household income must be less than 130% of the
6:166:10829:18:18:137:504:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:poverty line (in FY2013, 130% of poverty is $1,211/month for one person
6:167:10900:18:28:137:318:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:and $2,498/month for four people).
6:168:10934:28:18:125:504:283:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•net income test – household income minus deductions must be less than
6:169:11004:18:27:137:269:265:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:A:100% of the poverty line.7
6:170:11030:27:18:125:504:238:143:g_d0_f10:143:g_d0_f2:A:•asset test – assets must be less than $2,000, excluding the recipient’s
6:171:11102:18:34:137:295:220:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:home and retirement accounts.
6:172:11131:34:15:121:503:186:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:7There is a standard deduction of $149 for households with 1 to 3 members (with higher
6:173:11217:15:12:108:504:171:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:amounts for larger households), a 20% earned income deduction, a medical expense de-

7:177:11546:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Households with a disabled person or a member whose age is 60 or above need
7:178:11621:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to pass only the net income test (not gross income), and face a less stringent
7:179:11699:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:asset threshold of $3,250. Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents who are
7:180:11771:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:working less than half time or do not meet certain work requirements are
7:181:11843:18:30:108:472:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:limited to receiving benefits for 3-months out of each 36-month period.
7:182:11914:30:18:125:503:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Program applicants must participate in an interview and provide docu-
7:183:11983:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mentation of legal residency, income, and expenses. Then, recipients need to
7:184:12059:18:30:108:457:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:complete a recertification on a recurring basis every 6 to 24 months.
7:185:12128:30:18:125:503:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Households receive an electronic benefit transfer card, which can be used to
7:186:12204:18:18:108:504:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:purchase food at supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores. About
7:187:12280:18:18:108:504:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:84% of benefits are spent at supermarkets (Castner and Henke (2011)).  A
7:188:12352:18:17:108:504:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:household’s benefit is equal to the maximum benefit, minus 30% of its net
7:189:12425:17:18:108:504:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:income. In fiscal year 2011, the maximum monthly benefit was $200 for one
7:190:12498:18:30:108:409:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:person (mean $146) and $668 for four people (mean $482).
7:191:12554:30:18:125:503:385:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:States administer the program, determining eligibility and issuing benefits.
7:192:12630:18:18:108:504:367:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The cost of benefits is paid entirely by the federal government, through USDA.
7:193:12708:18:18:108:504:349:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Administrative costs are split between the state and federal government. Each
7:194:12785:18:18:108:504:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:year, about 50,000 active cases are randomly selected for audits through the
7:195:12861:18:18:108:504:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Quality Control (QC) system, and the results are used to calculate a state’s
7:196:12937:18:18:108:504:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:payment error rate. In FY2011, the official national overpayment error rate
7:197:13012:18:18:108:504:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:was 3.0%, and the underpayment error rate was 0.8%. States with persistently
7:198:13088:18:30:108:317:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:high error rates incur financial penalties.

7:200:13198:18:18:108:504:211:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:recipients.  A recent series of papers by Hilary Hoynes, Diane Whitmore

7:202:13343:17:18:108:504:176:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the program’s impacts.  Almond et al. (2011) find that program exposure
7:203:13414:18:18:108:504:158:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:raised birth weights, and Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) find that the pro-
7:204:13489:18:18:108:504:140:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:gram raised food expenditures. Evidently, program recipients face significant
7:205:13566:18:0:108:504:122:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash constraints, with lower caloric intake at the end of the monthly benefit

8:224:14699:18:18:108:504:214:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and households with seniors were 5% of recipients. To better highlight changes

9:251:16048:34:18:125:503:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In this section, we analyze changes in SNAP from 1991 to 2001, with
9:252:16115:18:17:108:504:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:particular attention to the role of welfare reform in causing people to leave
9:253:16192:17:18:108:504:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP. We use the QC files and the SIPP to show that SNAP receipt declined
9:254:16265:18:18:108:504:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:more in demographic groups most affected by welfare reform, in states where
9:255:16340:18:18:108:504:266:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash assistance caseloads dropped the most, and for people receiving cash

9:259:16635:12:12:108:504:202:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:both variables are available, we find that using the most recent action date yields a quarterly
9:260:16730:12:12:108:504:190:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:entrance rate of 15% and using the case opening date yields a quarterly entrance rate of

9:265:17061:12:12:108:504:131:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:by the exposed population and therefore can allow more natural comparisons of transition

10:267:17221:0:18:125:502:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:From 1993 to 1999, the number of cash assistance recipients in the US
10:268:17290:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:fell dramatically.  An unusually strong labor market and expansions of the
10:269:17364:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Earned Income Tax Credit led single mothers to transition from cash assistance
10:270:17442:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receipt to work (Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001)).  Welfare reform played an
10:271:17513:18:18:108:504:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:important role as well: the first major waivers for changes in state welfare
10:272:17589:18:18:108:504:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:policy were given in 1992. By the time President Clinton signed the Personal
10:273:17665:18:18:108:504:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) in 1996, 37 states had
10:274:17736:18:18:108:504:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:already received waivers.  Currie and Grogger (2001) estimate a state-level
10:275:17811:18:18:108:504:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:model and find that the improving economy can explain about 30% and welfare
10:276:17886:18:18:108:504:510:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:reform can explain about 20% of the decrease in SNAP receipt from 1993 to
10:277:17959:18:30:108:135:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:1998.
10:278:17964:30:18:125:503:462:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Both panels of Figure 2 show that SNAP receipt fell relative to the overall
10:279:18039:18:17:108:504:444:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:population beginning in 1993, with the rate of decline increasing after welfare
10:280:18118:17:18:108:504:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:reform in 1996.  The new law also revoked SNAP eligibility for many legal
10:281:18191:18:18:108:504:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:immigrants.11Families with children, who were leaving cash assistance, show
10:282:18266:18:18:108:504:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the biggest declines in SNAP receipt. Adults, some of whom were newly sub-
10:283:18340:18:18:108:504:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:jected by PRWORA to a 3-months-out-of-36 time limit for SNAP receipt, also
10:284:18414:18:18:108:504:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:show large declines. Seniors, who presumably were least affected by welfare re-
10:285:18493:18:18:108:504:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:form, show the smallest declines. Figure 3 shows that through 1993, entrances
10:286:18570:18:18:108:504:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:exceed exits, and caseloads were rising. After this point, as the economy recov-
10:287:18650:18:18:108:504:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ered and states began experimenting with welfare reform, exits substantially
10:288:18726:18:18:108:504:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:exceed entrances, and caseloads begin to fall. As cash assistance recipients
10:289:18802:18:18:108:504:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:transitioned to work, we calculate in the QC files that the share of people in
10:290:18880:18:30:108:502:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP families with children reporting earned income rose from 30% to 45%.
10:291:18953:30:18:125:503:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:State-level evidence points to a link between the intensity of welfare reform
10:292:19030:18:17:108:504:199:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and SNAP receipt. Because the timing of welfare reform varied across states,
10:293:19106:17:16:117:503:182:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:11The number of eligible noncitizens fell from 2.71 million in 1994 to 1.33 million in 2000,
10:294:19198:16:12:108:504:166:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:and SNAP receipt fell even more sharply, from 1.81 million to 0.59 million, over the same
10:295:19287:12:12:108:504:154:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:period (Cunnyngham (2002)).  Borjas (2004) uses this policy change to study the effect
10:296:19373:12:12:108:504:142:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:of public assistance on food insecurity and finds that a 10 percentage point reduction in

11:316:20137:18:18:108:504:495:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The top panel of Figure 4 shows a strong, statistically significant correlation:
11:317:20217:18:17:108:504:477:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:a 10 log point decrease in cash assistance receipt is associated with about a
11:318:20294:17:18:108:504:460:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:3 log point decrease in SNAP receipt among families with children.12This
11:319:20366:18:18:108:504:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that at the state level, the intensity of welfare reform was correlated
11:320:20446:18:18:108:504:424:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with changes in SNAP receipt. Cash assistance receipt fell on average by 65
11:321:20521:18:18:108:504:406:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:log points in the five years after a state’s peak, and SNAP receipt fell by
11:322:20596:18:18:108:504:388:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:an average of 34 log points, so the change in SNAP receipt implied by the
11:323:20669:18:18:108:503:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cross-sectional coefficient (0.29*65=18.9) is about half of the observed drop in
11:324:20749:18:18:108:504:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP receipt. This means that above and beyond any changes in the national
11:325:20823:18:18:108:504:334:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:economy or national policies, changes in state-level conditions were important
11:326:20901:18:18:108:316:316:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:in explaining changes in SNAP receipt.13
11:327:20941:18:15:117:503:298:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:12An alternative specification uses a common time period, of 1994 to 1999. We drop Idaho
11:328:21029:15:12:108:504:283:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:and Wyoming, which are extreme outliers in their change in cash assistance. Here, we find a
11:329:21120:12:12:108:504:271:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:coefficient of 0.12, which is statistically significant at a 10% level. We find this specification
11:330:21218:12:12:108:504:259:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:less attractive because it does not account for heterogeneity in when states began changing
11:331:21309:12:9:108:295:247:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:their welfare programs, as discussed above.
11:332:21352:9:15:117:502:238:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:13Two pieces of evidence suggest that the state-level correlation between welfare reform
11:333:21440:15:12:108:504:223:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:and SNAP receipt is not simply the result of state economic conditions affecting caseloads for
11:334:21534:12:12:108:504:211:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:both transfer programs. First, our welfare reform measure has only a weak correlation with
11:335:21624:12:12:108:504:199:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:changes in the contemporaneous unemployment rate. A 10 log point decrease in caseloads
11:336:21710:12:12:108:504:187:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:from peak is associated with an additional decrease of 0.05 percentage points in the state
11:337:21800:12:12:108:504:175:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:unemployment rate (not statistically significant). Adding the state unemployment rate as a
11:338:21890:12:12:108:503:163:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:regressor in the regression specified in equation 3 has barely any impact on the coefficent on
11:339:21984:12:12:108:504:151:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the change in cash assistance. Because measurement error in the state unemployment rate
11:340:22071:12:12:108:504:139:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:could bias downward the impact of the unemployment rate in the regression, we find the

12:343:22339:0:18:125:503:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:To further explore the connection between welfare reform and SNAP re-
12:344:22408:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ceipt, we use the March CPS together with the QC files to study SNAP enroll-
12:345:22484:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ment by single mothers with children from 1993 through 1999. In particular,
12:346:22559:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we use the CPS data to distinguish among three explanations for the decline
12:347:22634:18:18:108:504:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in SNAP receipt: (1) mothers increased their employment and were no longer
12:348:22708:18:18:108:504:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:eligible, (2) mothers increased their employment, were still eligible, but be-
12:349:22786:18:18:108:504:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cause SNAP take-up rates are lower among those with earnings, their SNAP
12:350:22858:18:18:108:504:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:participation fell, and (3) changes in public assistance administrative prac-
12:351:22935:18:18:108:504:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tices or individual preferences reduced take-up among people with a given set

12:353:23033:29:18:125:503:481:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:First, we divide the sample of single mothers in the CPS by whether or
12:354:23103:18:18:108:504:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:not their income was below 130% of poverty each year – suggesting whether
12:355:23176:18:18:108:504:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:they were likely to be eligible for SNAP. We then sub-divide the likely-eligible
12:356:23256:18:18:108:504:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:sample into four groups: “Work Only”, “Cash Assistance Only”, “Work and
12:357:23327:18:18:108:504:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Cash”, or “Neither Work Nor Cash”. We define a family as “working” if they
12:358:23401:18:18:108:504:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:have annual earnings equal to at least 25% of the annual poverty line and as
12:359:23477:18:18:108:504:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:“receiving cash assistance” if they report assistance equal to at least 10% of
12:360:23555:18:18:108:504:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the annual poverty line. The proportion of people in each group is shown in
12:361:23630:18:18:108:504:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the top panel of Appendix Table 1. We see a decline in the share of single
12:362:23704:18:17:108:504:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:mothers who are likely to be eligible for SNAP from 63% to 53%. Among that
12:363:23778:17:18:108:504:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pool of likely eligibles, we see a sharp decrease in the share receiving only cash
12:364:23860:18:18:108:503:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:assistance. This is offset by a large increase in the share of single mothers
12:365:23937:18:18:108:504:266:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:only working, as well as an increase in the share who are neither working nor
12:366:24014:18:30:108:237:248:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receiving cash assistance.
12:367:24040:30:18:125:503:218:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we calculate the number of SNAP recipients in each of these four cells
12:368:24116:18:21:108:504:200:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:using data from the QC. As a secondary measure, we also construct estimates
12:369:24191:21:12:108:503:179:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:in SNAP receipt for adults and seniors – populations that were less affected by state-level
12:370:24282:12:12:108:503:167:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:welfare reform activities – we find a smaller and statistically insignificant coefficient. This
12:371:24377:12:12:108:504:155:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:is evidence that the welfare reform variable reflects state-level policy changes, and not just
12:372:24471:12:8:108:305:143:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:changes in the state’s labor market situation.
12:373:24517:8:16:117:503:135:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:14Narrative accounts of welfare reform implementation suggest that when people left cash

12:375:24699:11:0:108:493:108:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:them) that they remained eligible for SNAP (Government Accountability Office (1999)).
13:376:24786:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the number of SNAP recipients in each cell from the CPS, even though
13:377:24857:18:18:108:503:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the CPS measure suffers from significant underreporting. These estimates are
13:378:24933:18:30:108:428:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:presented in the second and third panels of Appendix Table 1.
13:379:24994:30:18:125:503:606:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:The bottom two panels of Appendix Table 1 also report ratios within each
13:380:25066:18:18:108:504:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cell of QC recipient totals to CPS population totals and of CPS recipient
13:381:25139:18:18:108:504:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:totals to CPS population totals. Computing the ratio with the QC data in the
13:382:25215:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:numerator and CPS data in the denominator gives us a number analogous to a
13:383:25289:18:18:108:504:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:take-up rate. Such a comparison is likely to be imperfect because the QC files
13:384:25367:18:18:108:504:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:are based on monthly data, while the CPS is based on annual interview data,
13:385:25442:18:18:108:504:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and because cash assistance receipt for single mothers is underreported in the
13:386:25520:18:18:108:504:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:CPS. In particular, there are more single moms in the QC data with Cash

13:388:25666:18:17:108:504:444:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:1.15Nevertheless, such a comparison is useful for examining trends over time.
13:389:25743:17:18:108:504:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:The ratio is highest for the Cash Only group, with an average value of 1.53,
13:390:25819:18:18:108:504:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and lowest for the Work Only group, with an average value of 0.49. Notably,
13:391:25894:18:18:108:504:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:all four ratios are fairly stable over this time period. The ratio for the Work
13:392:25973:18:18:108:504:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and Cash group shows evidence of an increase, but this is the smallest group
13:393:26049:18:18:108:504:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in absolute magnitude and is therefore most likely to have imprecise ratio
13:394:26123:18:18:108:504:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:estimates. CPS-based results are similar. Within each cell, there is very little
13:395:26203:18:30:108:494:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:change over time in the ratio of SNAP recipients to SNAP-eligible families.
13:396:26278:30:18:125:503:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:These take-up ratios allow for a unique decomposition of changes in SNAP
13:397:26350:18:18:108:504:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receipt, first by changes in income eligibility, and then, among income-eligible
13:398:26430:18:33:108:410:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:individuals, by changes in work and cash assistance status.

13:400:26541:18:16:117:504:202:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:15This comparison is made more difficult because, as documented by Meyer et al. (2009),
13:401:26628:16:12:108:504:186:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the underreporting of cash assistance in the CPS is rising during this period. Interpreting
13:402:26719:12:12:108:504:174:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:results from changes in this ratio as changes in take-up requires an assumption that reporting
13:403:26813:12:11:108:504:162:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:rates for cash assistance are constant. The ratio of the administrative monthly enrollment
13:404:26903:11:12:108:504:151:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:total from HHS to the CPS total using our method falls from 104% in 1993 to 87% in
13:405:26985:12:12:108:504:139:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:1999. We rescale our cells each year to match changes in this aggregate reporting ratio.
13:406:27073:12:12:108:503:127:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Effectively, this assumes that there is no differential reporting of earnings in the CPS among
13:407:27167:12:0:108:354:115:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:cash assistance recipients as compared to non-recipients.

14:413:27364:18:18:108:504:622:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:preferred QC-based estimates. Overall, of the 4.4 million person decrease in

14:416:27595:18:18:108:504:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the decrease is due to a shift among people who remained eligible from the
14:417:27672:18:18:108:504:550:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:high take-up category of only receiving cash assistance to the two lower-take

14:419:27825:18:18:108:504:514:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with the CPS-based measure of SNAP receipt are similar. Changes in take-up
14:420:27899:18:18:108:504:496:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ratios within each cell do not play an important role. In other words, in terms
14:421:27978:18:17:108:504:478:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the theories outlined on the previous page, we find evidence consistent with
14:422:28057:17:18:108:504:461:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:theories (1) and (2), but not theory (3). Whether policy makers intended to
14:423:28132:18:18:108:504:443:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:have families who remained income eligible lose SNAP receipt when they left
14:424:28207:18:42:108:240:425:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash assistance is unclear.

14:428:28414:18:17:108:504:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to 69% in 2006 and 2007. Eligibility rose from 31.2 million in 2001 to 34.4
14:429:28489:17:18:108:504:296:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:million in 2002, due largely to changes in vehicle rules, and then roughly kept
14:430:28568:18:18:108:504:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:pace with population growth to reach 37.1 million people in 2007 (Eslami et al.

14:432:28719:18:18:108:504:242:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to 26.6 million in July 2007.  Two factors can explain most of the increase

14:436:29002:18:18:108:504:159:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:were several policy changes, designed in particular to make it easier to combine
14:437:29082:18:18:108:439:141:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:work and SNAP receipt. In 2001, Bost testified before Congress:

15:441:29330:18:18:137:474:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:and complexity are hampering its performance in the post-welfare

15:451:29949:49:17:108:504:443:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Most of these policy changes were implemented by giving states waivers from
15:452:30024:17:18:108:504:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:program rules, allowing states to verify eligiblity in new ways. For example,

15:456:30333:18:18:108:504:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:requirements. Similarly, most states reduced the frequency at which they col-

15:458:30487:18:18:108:504:318:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:income reporting requirements eased participation for low-income households

15:464:30872:18:17:108:504:198:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:1.5% of people were entering and exiting each quarter. Because, as Bost says,
15:465:30949:17:18:108:504:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:families with marginal labor force attachment will experience greater changes

16:479:31913:17:18:137:504:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:states waivers requiring the reporting of only significant income changes

16:492:32775:17:18:137:414:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:states and DC had stopped using such short intervals.
16:493:32828:18:16:117:503:207:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:17An increase in SNAP receipt among families without earnings may occur in conjunction

18:532:35561:18:18:137:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:asset test. BBCE allowed states to eliminate the net income and asset
18:533:35630:18:18:137:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:tests, and also to raise the threshold for the gross income test, up to

18:535:35772:18:18:137:504:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:benefit minus 30% of net income. For example, in 2013, a household
18:536:35838:18:18:137:504:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:with four members and net income at 100% of poverty would receive a
18:537:35905:18:18:137:504:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:monthly benefit of $92. Put another way, four-member households with

18:556:37144:16:12:108:504:147:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:standing “Categorical Eligibility” policy, which made people already receiving cash assistance
18:557:37238:12:8:108:249:135:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:automatically eligible for SNAP.
18:558:37270:8:16:117:503:127:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:23For example, Trippe and Gillooly (2010) and Government Accountability Office (2012)
18:559:37355:16:0:108:335:111:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:disagree on the date of BBCE adoption for 7 states.
19:560:37408:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:not identify the causal impact of these specific policies, because their adoption
19:561:37489:18:30:108:374:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:may be markers for other state-level policy changes.
19:562:37541:30:18:125:502:624:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We report results in Figure 5 and Appendix Table 2. Only the coefficients
19:563:37614:18:18:108:504:606:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:on simplified reporting and short recertifications are statistically significant.
19:564:37695:18:18:108:504:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we construct an omnibus summary index of all eight policies. The
19:565:37768:18:18:108:504:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient on this index implies that switching from the most stringent policies
19:566:37849:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to the most lenient policies raises the take-up rate by a statistically significant
19:567:37932:18:30:108:410:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:9.1 percentage points, from a sample mean of 65.2 percent.
19:568:37990:30:18:125:503:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We also consider an alternative specification with the percent of popula-

19:570:38132:18:18:108:504:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we find that BBCE, simplified reporting, call centers, and ending short recer-
19:571:38210:18:17:108:503:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tifications have a significant and positive effect on enrollment.24Using the
19:572:38286:17:18:108:504:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:summary index, switching to all of the new policies implies a 2.5 percentage
19:573:38362:18:18:108:504:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:point increase in a state’s population receiving SNAP, from a sample mean of
19:574:38438:18:30:108:394:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:9.0 percent, and this estimate is statistically significant.
19:575:38498:30:18:125:502:367:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We can use these coefficients to estimate the impact of policy changes on
19:576:38571:18:18:108:504:349:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate takeup and enrollment. The mean for the summary index rose by
19:577:38642:18:18:108:504:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:0.42 from 2001 to 2007. Using our takeup regression, this implies an increase
19:578:38719:18:18:108:504:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in take-up of 3.8 percentage points, one-fourth of the increase in take-up dur-
19:579:38798:18:18:108:504:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ing this period.  Alternatively, using our enrollment estimates, this implies
19:580:38875:18:18:108:504:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:an increase in enrollment of 1.0 percentage points, or about one-third of the
19:581:38952:18:18:108:504:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:increase in the enrollment during this period. Given the measurement error
19:582:39026:18:18:108:504:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:regarding the timing of implementation, these estimates are likely to be a lower
19:583:39106:18:18:108:504:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bound on the impact of state-level policy changes on SNAP take-up during
19:584:39178:18:17:108:174:205:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:this period.25
19:585:39192:17:16:117:503:188:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:24An extensive literature estimates the effect of state SNAP policies on enrollment rates.
19:586:39282:16:12:108:504:172:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Most papers find insignificant coefficients for most policies. Klerman and Danielson (2011),
19:587:39374:12:12:108:504:160:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Mabli and Ferrerosa (2010), and Mabli et al. (2009) report that a state’s adoption of BBCE
19:588:39464:12:12:108:504:148:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:had a statistically significant impact on enrollment raising it by 6% and simplified reporting
19:589:39558:12:12:108:504:136:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:raised enrollment by about a statistically significant 4%. These estimates are slightly smaller
19:590:39653:12:8:108:259:124:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:than the coefficients reported here.
19:591:39689:8:0:117:503:116:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:25Enrollment rose from 5.9% of the US population in 2001 to 8.8% in 2007. Other authors
20:592:39778:0:18:125:503:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the rise in SNAP receipt may have been, in part, a bounceback from
20:593:39853:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:welfare reform, a channel overlooked by existing research. In the bottom panel
20:594:39931:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of Figure 4, we show that states which had bigger declines in cash assistance
20:595:40008:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receipt in the 1990’s also had bigger increases in SNAP receipt among families
20:596:40086:18:18:108:503:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with children in subsequent years (tpeak+6totpeak+11), with an estimated
20:597:40158:18:18:108:504:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient of -0.45. This coefficient likely also reflects, in part, changes in the
20:598:40242:18:18:108:504:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:state-level economy. We find that a 10 log point decrease in caseloads during

20:600:40394:18:18:108:503:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ployment over the bounceback period (statistically significant).26Therefore,
20:601:40470:18:18:108:503:510:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we think that one reason the coefficient for the relationship between changes in
20:602:40550:18:18:108:504:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:cash assistance caseloads and immediate changes in SNAP is smaller than the
20:603:40625:18:18:108:504:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bounceback coefficient is because the bounceback coefficient in part reflects
20:604:40702:18:29:108:299:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:state-level changes in unemployment.
20:605:40738:29:18:125:503:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, the data show an increase in SNAP take-up during this period,
20:606:40808:18:18:108:504:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with relatively stable eligibility and a stable poverty rate. It appears that both
20:607:40890:18:18:108:504:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:specific policy changes to improve access and bounceback from welfare reform
20:608:40966:18:63:108:304:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:played large roles in rising enrollment.

20:613:41241:22:12:108:504:219:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:have also run up against measurement error challenges in using state-level policy variables
20:614:41332:12:12:108:504:207:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:to explain caseload trends during periods of major policy change. For example, Danielson
20:615:41420:12:12:108:504:195:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:and Klerman (2008) find that measured policy variation can explain only about one-fifth of
20:616:41510:12:8:108:397:183:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the measured decline in cash assistance receipt from 1992 to 2005.
20:617:41576:8:16:117:503:175:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:26In addtion, SNAP enrollment for adults and seniors in these states bounced back as
20:618:41660:16:8:108:127:159:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:well.
20:619:41665:8:16:117:503:151:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:27These estimates are the national monthly totals published by USDA. In Table 4, we
20:620:41748:16:12:108:504:135:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:report the average monthly caseload for Q3 in the QC files, which is 26.04 million recipients
20:621:41841:12:12:108:504:123:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:in 2007 and 45.14 million in 2011. Appendix D of Leftin et al. (2012) explains that the
20:622:41928:12:0:108:504:111:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:QC counts are slightly lower because they omit families receiving Disaster SNAP and cases

21:624:42091:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Oliveira (2012) used national time series data to examine the correlation be-
21:625:42168:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tween the unemployment rate and SNAP receipt, and concluded that the in-
21:626:42240:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:crease in SNAP participation during the recent recession was “consistent with
21:627:42317:18:18:108:503:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the increase during previous periods of economic decline.”28In contrast, Mul-

21:629:42473:18:18:108:504:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:safety net benefits in 2010 that would not have been eligible for benefits in
21:630:42550:18:18:108:504:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:2007 even if their circumstances had been the same in the two years, because
21:631:42626:18:28:108:400:528:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:the rules for receiving safety net benefits had changed.”29
21:632:42685:28:18:125:502:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We perform three sets of analysis to explore the sources of the increase in
21:633:42760:18:18:108:504:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP take-up during this period. First, we estimate the relationship between
21:634:42836:18:18:108:504:464:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment and SNAP receipt at the family level. Next we examine the
21:635:42906:18:18:108:504:446:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:connection between unemployment and SNAP receipt at the county level. Fi-
21:636:42979:18:18:108:504:428:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:nally we examine in detail the eligibility expansions which may have increased
21:637:43057:18:26:108:201:410:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP enrollment.

21:639:43114:29:18:125:502:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We begin by analyzing the family-level relationship between unemployment
21:640:43186:18:18:108:503:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:and SNAP receipt using data from the SIPP.30We estimate the fraction of time
21:641:43262:18:17:108:504:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that a family’s labor force participants were unemployed over the past sixteen
21:642:43340:17:18:108:504:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:months, using data from mid-2007 and mid-2011. The top panel of Figure 6
21:643:43412:18:18:108:504:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:shows that the frequency of prolonged unemployment spells rose substantially.
21:644:43489:18:18:108:504:266:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Next, we compute the probability of SNAP receipt for families by time spent
21:645:43564:18:18:108:504:248:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:unemployed. The bottom panel of Figure 6 shows that the probability of SNAP
21:646:43639:18:18:108:504:230:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receipt in 2007 is rising sharply by unemployment status, from 5% of people
21:647:43714:18:21:108:504:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in families with no unemployment to about 60% of people in families with
21:648:43786:21:8:108:300:191:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:which were found to be ineligible for SNAP.
21:649:43829:8:16:117:503:183:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:28Relatedly, Anderson et al. (2012) show that the share of working-age SNAP recipients
21:650:43915:16:8:108:392:167:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:also receiving unemployment insurance rose during the recession.

21:652:44066:16:12:108:504:143:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:responsible for “66 percent of the growth of SNAP household participation in excess of family
21:653:44159:12:8:108:397:131:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:(125 percent) poverty growth between fiscal years 2007 and 2010.”

22:656:44358:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment for sixteen consecutive months. The same strong correlation
22:657:44430:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:between duration and SNAP receipt exists in 2011, although the probability
22:658:44504:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of SNAP receipt is higher in this later year for families with short durations.
22:659:44583:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Using 2007 SNAP receipt rates by duration and the 2011 SIPP distribution of

22:663:44883:18:18:108:504:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we can explain about half the increase in SNAP receipt among the entire US

23:738:47951:15:9:108:245:210:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:raises SNAP enrollment by 6%.
23:739:47980:9:15:117:503:201:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:33Details on construction of this sample are in Appendix A.2. This dataset has two key
23:740:48066:15:12:108:504:186:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:limitations. First, not all states report county-level enrollment statistics to FNS. In 1990,
23:741:48159:12:12:108:504:174:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:we have county-level data for 85% of SNAP enrollment, and by 2007, after some states have
23:742:48248:12:12:108:504:162:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:stopped reporting, we have county-level data for 80% of SNAP enrollment. Second, among
23:743:48334:12:12:108:504:150:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the matched observations, there is measurement error in the county-level unemployment
23:744:48419:12:12:108:504:138:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:rate, as well as measurement error because enrollment at a county’s SNAP office may not
23:745:48506:12:8:108:307:126:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:correspond to enrollment by county residents.
23:746:48551:8:0:117:368:118:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:34We found that a third lag was statistically insignificant.
24:747:48613:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:increase in the unemployment rate, the model predicts an increase in SNAP

24:749:48762:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:population, the effect of unemployment is even larger (column 2), producing

24:751:48874:30:18:125:503:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:One striking feature of these estimates is that unemployment has highly
24:752:48945:18:18:108:504:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:persistent impacts on SNAP enrollment.36In the bottom panel of Figure 7,
24:753:49017:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we compute the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in unemployment for
24:754:49091:18:18:108:504:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:three years on SNAP enrollment over a five-year horizon. Some commentators
24:755:49165:18:18:108:504:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:(Furchtgott-Roth (2012)) have raised concerns that SNAP receipt remained
24:756:49237:18:18:108:504:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:high even after the unemployment rate peaked in June 2009.  In fact, our
24:757:49309:18:18:108:504:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:estimates show that a feature of the aftermath of past recessions is persistently-
24:758:49391:18:29:108:227:462:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:elevated SNAP receipt.
24:759:49413:29:18:125:502:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We show robustness checks to our specification in Appendix Table 3. First,
24:760:49487:18:18:108:503:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:we report estimates from a specification without year fixed effectsφt(columns
24:761:49564:18:18:108:504:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:1 and 2).  Unsurprisingly, when the national unemployment rate is higher,
24:762:49637:18:18:108:504:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:SNAP enrollment rises as well, and so this specification yields larger coef-
24:763:49713:18:18:108:504:361:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ficients. This may reflect spillovers in the impacts of unemployment across

24:765:49862:18:18:108:504:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment. Second, we use the share of the population receiving SNAP as

27:885:56323:18:18:108:504:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:that enrollment for people with excess income would have grown at the same
27:886:56397:18:18:108:504:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rate between 2007 and 2011 as enrollment of people eligible under standard
27:887:56471:18:18:108:504:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:rules.  Under this assumption, new adoption of BBCE raised enrollment of
27:888:56543:18:18:108:504:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:people with excess income by 1.0 million. In other words, we estimate that
27:889:56617:18:18:108:504:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:of the 1.7 million indivdiuals eligible because of BBCE in 2011, 700,000 were
27:890:56694:18:18:108:504:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:eligible based on pre-2007 state adoption of BBCE and 1,000,000 were eligible
27:891:56771:18:30:108:289:301:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:because of recession-era adoption.42
27:892:56807:30:18:125:503:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:BBCE also allowed states to raise or eliminate asset limits. Because case-
27:893:56881:18:18:108:504:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:workers do not record assets in BBCE states, we cannot count enrollment with
27:894:56957:18:18:108:504:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:excess assets using the QC files. In 2011, Idaho and Michigan reinstated asset
27:895:57035:18:18:108:504:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:limits of $5,000 and caseloads fell by 1 percent or less (Government Account-

27:897:57196:16:12:108:504:183:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:if (1) they are not receiving pure cash assistance (because they are already categorically

27:899:57372:12:12:108:504:159:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:gross income > 130% of poverty if they do not have a senior or a disabled person. Our
27:900:57457:12:12:108:504:147:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:estimates are very similar to those reported by Government Accountability Office (2012)

27:902:57598:8:15:117:503:127:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:42Using the same methodology, we calculate that recession-era BBCE adoption raised
27:903:57680:15:0:108:435:112:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:benefit expenditures on people with excess income by $200 million in 2011.

28:905:57832:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:BBCE during the recession raised enrollment of people with excess assets by

28:908:57983:18:18:108:504:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:half time or not meeting employment-training requirements to a 3-month time
28:909:58058:18:18:108:504:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:limit on SNAP benefits during any 36-month period. However, the legislation
28:910:58133:18:18:108:503:552:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:established a waiver of time limits in places with elevated unemployment.44
28:911:58208:18:18:108:504:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Without time limits, more people are eligible, and there is greater incentive
28:912:58285:18:18:108:504:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to apply, given the potential for a longer duration of receipt. Conceptually,
28:913:58362:18:18:108:504:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:because state eligiblity for ABAWD waivers mechanically expands and shrinks
28:914:58437:18:18:108:504:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:with the unemployment rate, these waivers have a lot in common with con-
28:915:58509:18:18:108:504:462:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ventional automatic stabilizers, even though they require a state decision to
28:916:58586:18:29:108:359:444:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:apply for the waivers for them to go into effect.45
28:917:58637:29:18:125:503:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In 2007, about one-third of the SNAP enrollment was in places with a
28:918:58705:18:18:108:504:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:waiver. As the country headed into recession, nearly all places became eligible
28:919:58784:18:19:108:503:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for waivers.46In 2011, we estimate that 4.3 million SNAP recipients (9.5% of
28:920:58860:19:15:117:503:360:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:43Idaho and Michigan reinstated asset limits of $5,000, which included some people who
28:921:58946:15:12:108:504:345:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:would have been excluded by a $2,000 asset limit. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances,
28:922:59034:12:12:108:504:333:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:we estimate that asset limits of $2,000 would have caused caseloads to fall twice as much as
28:923:59126:12:12:108:504:321:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:a $5,000 limit. Based on this fact, we assume that people with excess assets account for 2%
28:924:59217:12:12:108:504:309:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:of the total caseload in BBCE states. In 2007, the 11 states without asset tests accounted
28:925:59307:12:12:108:504:297:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:for 18% of SNAP enrollment and in 2011, the 39 states without asset tests in 2011 accounted
28:926:59398:12:12:108:504:285:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:for 79% of total SNAP enrollment. We calculate the total number of individuals affected as
28:927:59488:12:12:108:504:273:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:.02 x (.79-.18) x 45 million. This could be an overestimate if the true impact of the Idaho
28:928:59579:12:12:108:504:261:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:and Michigan policy changes analyzed by the GAO was less than 1 percent rather than
28:929:59662:12:12:108:504:249:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:equal to 1 percent. Because we lack micro data on these asset limit changes, in constructing
28:930:59754:12:12:108:504:237:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:an annual pattern of the impact of these changes for Figure 8 we assume that enrollment
28:931:59841:12:8:108:370:225:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:for cases with excess assets grew linearly from 2007 to 2011.
28:932:59902:8:16:117:503:217:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:44A “place” may be a city, a county, or a group of counties. Commonly used criteria are
28:933:59989:16:12:108:504:201:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:if a place has an unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national average, has
28:934:60076:12:12:108:504:189:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:unemployment above 10%, is designated by the Department of Labor as a “Labor Surplus
28:935:60160:12:8:108:393:177:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Area”, or has a “low and declining employment-population ratio.”
28:936:60224:8:16:117:503:169:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:45Some portion of the coefficients estimated using equation 8 likely reflects the business
28:937:60314:16:12:108:504:153:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:cycle pattern of ABAWD waivers because about half of our 1990 to 2007 sample period is
28:938:60400:12:8:108:303:141:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:after the new waiver procedures were set up.
28:939:60444:8:15:117:503:133:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:46USDA administrators issued a memo on January 8, 2009 (Foley (2009)) saying that
28:940:60525:15:0:108:504:118:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:states with Extended Unemployment Compensation for unemployment insurance were al-

29:942:60683:18:18:108:504:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:for this group had instead grown at the same rate as enrollment of people eligi-
29:943:60763:18:18:108:504:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:ble under standard rules, there would be about 2.5 million potential ABAWDs
29:944:60838:18:18:108:504:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:receiving SNAP. Under this assumption, the recession-induced waivers raised
29:945:60913:18:30:108:284:600:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment by 1.9 million people.48
29:946:60948:30:18:125:503:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:We find that the impact of BBCE adoption and ABAWD waivers was
29:947:61010:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:smaller in terms of benefit dollars than in terms of enrollment. Real spending
29:948:61088:18:18:108:504:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in 2011 dollars rose from $31.9 billion in 2007 to $71.9 billion in 2011, an
29:949:61164:18:18:108:504:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:increase of $40.0 billion.  BBCE adoption raised spending by $1.1 billion,
29:950:61238:18:18:108:504:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:accounting for 3% of the increase, and ABAWD waivers raised spending by
29:951:61309:18:18:108:504:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:$3.6 billion, accounting for 9% of the increase. Put another way, total SNAP
29:952:61385:18:29:108:421:462:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:spending increased by 6% as a result of these policy changes.
29:953:61446:29:18:125:503:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the Recovery Act temporarily raised the maximum SNAP benefit
29:954:61515:18:18:108:504:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:by 13.6%, which increased the incentive to enroll and may have raised take-
29:955:61590:18:18:108:504:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:up among the already eligible. It is difficult to quantify the impact of this
29:956:61667:18:18:108:504:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:change because SNAP benefits are set at the federal level. However, a series of
29:957:61746:18:18:108:504:361:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:papers estimating the take-up elasticity for unemployment insurance, another

29:959:61896:18:22:108:503:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:tween 0.19 and 0.59.49Applying this range to the 18% increase in average
29:960:61968:22:11:108:504:303:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:lowed to waive ABAWD time limits. Nearly all states had EUC during the recession, which
29:961:62055:11:12:108:504:292:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:qualified them for an ABAWD waiver. Then, the Recovery Act issued a national waiver of
29:962:62141:12:12:108:504:280:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:time limits through FY2010. After this authority expired, nearly all states received waivers
29:963:62233:12:9:108:335:268:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:in FY2011 due to continued labor market weakness.
29:964:62282:9:15:117:502:259:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:47We classify a person as a potential ABAWD if they are: ages 18-49, have no children in
29:965:62370:15:12:108:504:244:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:the household, are working less than 30 hours a week, and are not disabled. Following Leftin
29:966:62462:12:12:108:504:232:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:et al. (2012), we define a person disabled if (1) they have SSI income, (2) the household has no
29:967:62558:12:12:108:504:220:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:elderly members and a medical deduction, or (3) the person is exempt from work registration
29:968:62649:12:12:108:504:208:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:due to disability, and has income from Social Security, veterans’ benefits, or workers’ comp.
29:969:62742:12:12:108:504:196:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:We classify these people as “potential” ABAWDs because many had enrolled within the
29:970:62825:12:12:108:504:184:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:previous three months, and likely had not exhausted their time limits. For example, 29% of
29:971:62915:12:8:108:429:172:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:potential ABAWDs in FY2011 had enrolled within the last three months.
29:972:62984:8:16:117:503:164:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:48Using the same methodology, we calculate that recession-induced waivers raised benefit
29:973:63072:16:8:108:266:148:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:expenditures by $3.6 billion in 2011.
29:974:63109:8:16:117:503:140:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:49McCall (1995) uses the CPS Displaced Worker Survey to estimate a that a 10% increase
29:975:63195:16:12:108:504:124:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:in UI benefits raises benefit expenditure through takeup by 1.9%-3.0%. Anderson and Meyer
29:976:63284:12:0:108:504:112:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:(1997) use administrative data from six state UI programs to estimate an elasticity between
30:977:63377:0:26:108:486:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:household SNAP benefits implies an increase in enrollment of 3% to 11%.

30:979:63495:29:18:125:503:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 8 summarizes our enrollment results for unemployment and eligi-
30:980:63565:18:18:108:504:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:bility expansions together. We find that expanded adoption of BBCE raised
30:981:63638:18:18:108:504:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment by 1.57 million people, and automatic waivers of time limits raised
30:982:63716:18:18:108:504:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment by 1.87 million people, for a total of 3.44 million. Together, these
30:983:63795:18:18:108:504:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:two changes can account for 18% of the total increase in enrollment over this
30:984:63872:18:18:108:504:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:period. Beyond that, unemployment raises SNAP receipt both by increasing
30:985:63944:18:18:108:503:509:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:the number of people who are eligible and increasing need among eligibles.50
30:986:64020:18:18:108:504:491:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Recall that we estimated two different specifications for the impact of unem-

30:988:64169:18:18:108:504:455:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:another which weighted counties according to population. The equal-weighted
30:989:64244:18:18:108:504:437:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:estimate is shown in the top panel, and here our model slightly underpredicts
30:990:64321:18:17:108:504:419:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the actual increase in SNAP enrollment. The population-weighted estimate,
30:991:64394:17:18:108:504:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:in the bottom panel, slightly overpredicts the actual values in 2010 and 2011.
30:992:64472:18:18:108:504:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:A simple decomposition suggests that for the other 15.7 million people who
30:993:64546:18:18:108:504:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrolled in SNAP about one-third is attributable to increases in the number of
30:994:64624:18:18:108:504:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:eligible individuals, holding program rules fixed, and two-thirds is attributable
30:995:64705:18:30:108:278:330:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f3:B:to increases in the take-up rate.51
30:996:64740:30:18:125:503:300:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:SNAP enrollment rose by 19.1 million people from July 2007 to July 2011,
30:997:64812:18:18:108:504:282:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:an unprecedented increase, but one that the estimates from our unemployment
30:998:64887:18:18:108:504:264:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:regressions indicate was mostly the result of the program’s built-in automatic
30:999:64965:18:30:108:497:246:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:stabilizer features operating as usual in the midst of a very severe recession.
30:1000:65044:30:22:125:503:216:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Mulligan (2012) estimates that post-2007 policy changes increased SNAP
30:1001:65114:22:8:108:169:194:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:0.39 and 0.59.
30:1002:65128:8:16:117:502:186:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:50We believe that our model is conservative in only focusing on the unemployment rate.
30:1003:65214:16:12:108:504:170:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:In particular, other household economic measures suggest that the Great Recession was a
30:1004:65301:12:12:108:504:158:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:time of very serious economic need. Long-term unemployment and food insecurity reached
30:1005:65387:12:8:108:170:146:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:all-time highs.
30:1006:65402:8:16:117:503:138:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:51The number of people living below 125% of the poverty line increased by a factor of
30:1007:65487:16:12:108:504:122:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:1.2, while the number of people enrolled in SNAP, after subtracting 3.3 million for reasons
30:1008:65578:12:0:108:302:110:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:detailed above, increased by a factor of 1.58.
31:1009:65626:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment by 20.3 percent.  Our comparable number is that these changes
31:1010:65698:18:30:108:341:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:account for 7.5 percent of enrollment in 2011.
31:1011:65744:30:18:125:503:624:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Mulligan (pages 79-81) assumes that adoption of relaxed vehicle policies
31:1012:65816:18:18:108:504:606:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:during the recession and changes in asset policies in the 2008 Farm Bill raised
31:1013:65895:18:18:108:503:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:participation by 12%.52However, the SNAP Policy Database shows that by
31:1014:65965:18:18:108:504:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:2007, 46 states had already adopted relaxed vehicle policies (see Table 2). The
31:1015:66044:18:18:108:504:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:2008 Farm Bill excluded retirement accounts and 529s from the asset test; this
31:1016:66122:18:17:108:504:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:had a minimal impact on eligibility, given that asset limits bind so rarely, as
31:1017:66201:17:30:108:191:517:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:discussed above.
31:1018:66217:30:18:125:503:487:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Mulligan further assumes that BBCE raised enrollment nationally by an
31:1019:66286:18:18:108:504:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:additional 6%, which is larger than our estimate of 3.5%. His estimate comes
31:1020:66362:18:18:108:503:451:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:from comparing the differential increase in SNAP enrollment among states that
31:1021:66439:18:18:108:504:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:had adopted BBCE by 2010 relative to the ones that had not. However, if state
31:1022:66516:18:18:108:504:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:economic conditions affect the decision to adopt BBCE, then this estimate
31:1023:66589:18:18:108:504:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:will conflate the impact of those conditions with the impact of the eligiblity
31:1024:66667:18:17:108:504:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:expansion.  States with BBCE by 2010 had unemployment rates averaging
31:1025:66736:17:18:108:504:362:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:9.2%, while the unemployment rate in non-BBCE states averaged 7.6%. Thus,
31:1026:66809:18:18:108:503:344:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:it seems quite possible that part of the differential SNAP enrollment by BBCE
31:1027:66886:18:18:108:504:326:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:states was a reflection of their greater economic distress.  In contrast, our
31:1028:66963:18:18:108:504:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:estimates directly count the number of individuals who were eligible under the
31:1029:67041:18:30:108:470:290:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:eligiblity expansions but would not have been eligible in their absence.
31:1030:67113:30:18:125:503:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, in assessing the impact of waiving ABAWD time limits, Mulligan
31:1031:67184:18:18:108:504:242:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:does a QC-based calculation that is quite similar to ours. He concludes that
31:1032:67260:18:17:108:503:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:the waiver of time limits raised enrollment by 2.3%, which issmallerthan
31:1033:67332:17:16:117:504:207:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:F:52Mulligan cites Ratcliffe et al. (2007) as finding that exempting a vehicle from the asset
31:1034:67423:16:12:108:504:191:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:test raises participation by 8-16%, and takes the midpoint of 12% as his estimate (see
31:1035:67509:12:12:108:503:179:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Ratcliffe et al. (2008) for the published version). Ratcliffe et al. (2007) uses SIPP data in
31:1036:67602:12:12:108:504:167:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:its analysis. Another paper using the SIPP, Hanratty (2006), reports that exempting one
31:1037:67689:12:12:108:504:155:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:vehicle changed enrollment by negative 5.5% to positive 7%. Estimates for the impact of
31:1038:67776:12:12:108:504:143:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:vehicle exemptions using state-level administrative enrollment counts are: 0.8%-1.2% from
31:1039:67865:12:12:108:504:131:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:Mabli et al. (2009) and 0.4%-0.9% from Klerman and Danielson (2011). In Appendix Table
31:1040:67951:12:11:108:504:119:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:2, we estimate with state-level data that exempting at least one vehicle raises enrollment by
31:1041:68044:11:0:108:124:108:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:F:2%.
32:1042:68049:0:18:108:504:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:our estimate of 4.1%. In Table 5, we provide a side-by-side comparison of our
32:1043:68126:18:31:108:486:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:estimates and Mulligan’s which summarizes the discussion in this section.
32:1044:68199:31:33:108:243:623:296:g_d0_f1:296:g_d0_f1:C:6Conclusion
32:1045:68210:33:18:125:504:590:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we examine changes in SNAP enrollment over the past twenty
32:1046:68283:18:18:108:504:572:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:years.  We show that a strong economy and welfare reform contributed to
32:1047:68354:18:18:108:504:554:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:falling enrollment in the 1990’s, and policy efforts to make the program more
32:1048:68431:18:18:108:504:536:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:accessible to workers and a bounceback from welfare reform caused enrollment
32:1049:68507:18:18:108:504:518:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:to rise between 2001 and 2007. Research on SNAP enrollment in the Great
32:1050:68578:18:18:108:504:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:Recession has been limited, and we attempt to fill this gap. We find that SNAP
32:1051:68656:18:18:108:504:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:acts as a automatic stabilizer: unemployment and temporary business-cycle

32:1053:68804:18:18:108:504:446:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:than state-level policy expansions in producing the surge in enrollment from
32:1054:68880:18:0:108:176:428:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:B:2007 to 2011.
