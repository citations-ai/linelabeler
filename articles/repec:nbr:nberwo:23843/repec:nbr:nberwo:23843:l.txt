2:35:1957:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Small  business  lending  by  the  four  largest  banks  fell  sharply  relative  to  others  in  2008  and 
2:36:2065:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:remained depressed  through  2014.  We  explore  the  dynamic  adjustment  process  following  this 
2:37:2164:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:credit  supply shock.  In  counties  where  the  largest  banks  had  a  high  market  share,  the  aggregate 
2:38:2273:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:flow of small business credit fell, interest rates rose, fewer businesses expanded, unemployment 
2:39:2369:14:14:71:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:rose,  and  wages  fell  from 2006  to  2010.  While  the  flow  of  credit  recovered  after  2010  as  other 
2:40:2479:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:lenders slowly filled the void, interest rates remain elevated. Although unemployment returns to 
2:41:2575:14:42:71:356:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:normal by 2014, the effect on wages persists in these areas.

3:69:3153:21:20:108:543:617:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The  above  quote  from  Karen  Mills,  the former  head  of  the  U.S.  Small  Business 
3:70:3242:20:21:72:543:597:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Administration, captures a concern expressed by many observers during the slow recovery from 
3:71:3335:21:21:72:542:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the 2007–2009 financial crisis and   Great Recession: t he possible existence of a small business 
3:72:3433:21:20:72:400:555:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:“credit gap”—i.e., a reduction in the supply of credit to small firms. 
3:73:3503:20:21:108:542:535:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we ask whether such a credit gap did in fact open up in the post-crisis period, 
3:74:3598:21:21:72:543:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and what its economic implications may   have been. Our point of departure, and the basis for our 
3:75:3696:21:21:72:542:493:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:empirical strategy, is shown in Figure 1, which plots Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data 
3:76:3788:21:20:72:542:472:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on small business loan originations by U.S. banks. While small business lending declined at all 
3:77:3884:20:21:72:542:452:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks beginning in 2008, the four largest banks—those owned by Bank of America, Citigroup, 
3:78:3975:21:21:72:543:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo—cut back significantly relative to the rest of the banking 
3:79:4066:21:20:72:542:410:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sector. By the trough in 2010, the annual flow of originations from the Top 4 banks stood at just 
3:80:4164:20:21:72:543:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:41% of its 2006 level, whereas the comparable figure for all other banks was 66%. Moreover, 
3:81:4256:21:21:72:543:369:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:originations at the Top 4 banks remained depressed after 2010, hovering at roughly 50% of their 
3:82:4352:21:20:72:543:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pre-  crisis level through 2014. By contrast, lending at other banks slowly recovered, approaching 
3:83:4451:20:21:72:243:328:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:80% of its pre-crisis level by 2014. 
3:84:4488:21:21:108:543:307:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We begin by arguing that this differential decline in small business lending at the Top 4 
3:85:4578:21:20:72:542:286:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks reflects a differential contraction in credit supply. A natural alternative is that there was a 
3:86:4680:20:21:72:542:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:differential shift   in credit demand, perhaps because the Top 4 were disproportionately located in 
3:87:4780:21:21:72:543:245:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:areas that were hardest hit by the Great Recession. Using CRA data   at the bank-county level, we 
3:88:4878:21:21:72:542:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:com pare the small business loan growth of the Top 4 banks in a given county to other banks 
3:89:4970:21:20:72:543:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:operating in the same county, thus sweeping away any local variation in loan demand. If anything, 
3:90:5068:20:21:72:542:183:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these within-county differences are slightly larger in absolute magnitude than the raw across-bank 
3:91:5167:21:21:72:542:162:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:differences depicted in Figure 1, which is consistent with a supply-side rather than demand-side 
3:92:5264:21:20:72:408:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:explanation for the differential decline in lending at the Top 4 banks.  
3:93:5337:20:21:108:543:121:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:A harder question is why the Top 4 banks cut   their   supply of small business loans more 
3:94:5428:21:0:72:543:100:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than other banks. Although we cannot answer this question definitively, we offer some hypotheses, 
4:95:5528:0:20:72:560:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which we flesh out in Section II. In brief, we think of the Top 4 loan supply shift    as evolving in 
4:96:5630:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:two distinct phases. First, the Top 4 pulled backed aggressively from small business lending in 
4:97:5726:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2008 during the midst of the financial crisis. At this time, they were experiencing high charge-off 
4:98:5826:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rates on their small business portfolios, reinforcing their historical underperformance in a  segment 
4:99:5927:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that they viewed as being peripheral to their overall business strategies. They also had to contend 
4:100:6027:21:21:72:564:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with    large credit losses across a range of other products, threatening their solvency and leading to 
4:101:6131:21:20:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unprecedented wholesale funding pressures. Facing these challenges, managers at large banks 
4:102:6223:20:21:72:542:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:chose to pull back from their non-core small business lending operations in order to focus on the 
4:103:6321:21:21:72:247:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:task of managing through the crisis. 
4:104:6358:21:22:108:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In the second phase, from 2010 to 2014, the   Top 4 banks were slow to return to small 
4:105:6445:22:22:72:543:500:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:busi  ness lending once the crisis had subsided, even as smaller banks, non-bank finance companies, 
4:106:6545:22:22:72:543:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and new online lenders began expanding in this market. This reluctance to re-e nter   seems to reflect 
4:107:6648:22:22:72:543:456:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a  reassessment by the Top 4 banks of  their co  mparative advantage in the small-business segment. 
4:108:6748:22:22:72:565:434:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:And t   hese concerns may have been amplified by several post-   crisis changes in financial regulation 
4:109:6852:22:22:72:543:412:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that weighed most heavily on the largest banks, including new capital surcharges for systemically 
4:110:6950:22:22:71:552:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:imp ortant institutions, the Federal Reserve’s annual bank stress-testing regime, and the  enhanced 
4:111:7050:22:22:72:290:368:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules. 
4:112:7093:22:23:108:542:346:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:To be clear, we do not attempt to estimate the causal impact of  these individual channels, 
4:113:7185:23:22:72:543:323:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:much less try to  distinguish between them. Nevertheless, we believe that the above narrative makes 
4:114:7285:22:22:72:543:301:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:it all the more plausible that the decline in Top 4 lending to small business that we document can 
4:115:7384:22:22:72:549:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:be thought of as reflecting a systematic and sustained supply-side shift, r ather than some sort of 
4:116:7484:22:22:72:542:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:noise in the data.1 With this observation in hand, the remainder of the paper then focuses on 
4:117:7578:22:50:72:539:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assessing the  economic  consequences  of  this shift  in credit  supply,  using a  difference-in-
4:118:7676:50:19:72:219:185:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
4:119:7725:19:15:72:542:166:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:1In this regard, it is interesting to contrast our empirical strategy with that of Greenstone, Mas, and Nguyen (2015). 
4:120:7844:15:12:72:542:151:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:They take a more atheoretic approach, inferring that a bank has experienced an inward shift in loan supply if it has a 
4:121:7963:12:11:71:542:139:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:negative bank fixed effect in a regression of bank-county level loan growth on bank and county fixed effects. By 
4:122:8076:11:12:71:539:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:contrast, we are effectively requiring that the negative bank fixed effect also be accompanied by some economically-
4:123:8192:12:11:71:542:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:grounded priors—i.e., by a plausible story for why the bank may have cut its supply. This is why we spend a good 
4:124:8305:11:12:71:542:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:deal of effort trying to understand the forces underlying the Top 4 cutback in lending. The advantage of our approach 
4:125:8423:12:11:71:541:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:is that we are less likely to pick up bank fixed effects that amount to measurement error from the standpoint of loan 
4:126:8541:11:0:71:104:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:supply. 
5:127:8550:0:22:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:differences strategy that compares outcomes in counties where the Top 4 banks had a large initial 
5:128:8648:22:22:72:475:686:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:market share to those in otherwise similar counties where they had a smaller share.  
5:129:8732:22:22:108:542:664:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We are particularly interested in understanding the dynamic impact of this contraction in 
5:130:8822:22:22:72:543:642:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit supply. Specifically, to the extent the pullback by the Top 4 was relatively persistent, one 
5:131:8922:22:22:72:543:620:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would naturally expect some degree of adjustment over time both by small businesses and by other 
5:132:9019:22:22:71:557:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suppliers of credit. With this dynamic perspective in mind, we first focus on county-level   outcomes 
5:133:9121:22:22:71:539:576:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:during the 2006–2010 period that covers the first phase of the Top 4’s withdrawal from small-
5:134:9214:22:22:71:542:554:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business lending. Compared to counties with a low initial Top 4 presence, we find that counties 
5:135:9310:22:22:71:561:532:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with a high initial Top 4 presence experience a decline in the annual flow of total    small business 
5:136:9412:22:22:71:542:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending, a decline in the fraction of business establishments that expand employment in a given 
5:137:9508:22:22:71:563:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:year,    slower employment growth, an increase in the  unemployment rate, and slower wage    growth. 
5:138:9609:22:23:71:542:466:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, our results suggest that the credit supply shock from the Top 4 banks had a meaningful 
5:139:9702:23:22:71:542:443:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact on labor market outcomes in affected counties in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. 
5:140:9801:22:20:107:542:421:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We then   explore how high Top 4 counties adapted from 2010 to 2014. We find that the 
5:141:9887:20:21:71:543:401:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:annual flow   of  small business credit to affected counties begins  to normalize after 2010 and has 
5:142:9988:21:21:71:547:380:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:largely returned to trend by 2014. We also find that the differences  in establishment expansion 
5:143:10085:21:20:71:542:359:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rates, employment growth, and unemployment rates between high and low Top 4 counties narrow 
5:144:10177:20:21:71:542:339:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:after 2010 and largely disappear by 2014. However, we document a more persistent negative effect 
5:145:10273:21:21:71:543:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on  county-level  wage  growth: the   difference between  high  and  low  Top  4  counties  remains 
5:146:10373:21:20:71:460:297:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:economically and statistically significant through the end of our sample in 2014. 
5:147:10455:20:21:107:543:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In order to shed more light on these persistent wage effects, as well as on adjustment by 
5:148:10545:21:21:71:543:256:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other lenders, we draw on proprietary data from a small business credit registry maintained by 
5:149:10640:21:21:71:543:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:PayNet Inc.    Using this data, we find that, beginning in 2008, small business borrowers in high Top 
5:150:10742:21:20:71:543:214:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:4 counties paid higher interest rates and obtained loans with shorter maturities. And, strikingly, 
5:151:10841:20:21:71:542:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these increases in the price of small business credit persist through 2014, consistent with the idea 
5:152:10942:21:21:71:513:173:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that small businesses have been forced to substitute towards higher cost providers of credit. 
5:153:11036:21:20:107:543:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The  persistence  of  these  interest-rate  effects  helps  to  make  sense  of  our  results  for 
5:154:11135:20:21:71:570:132:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment and wages. Consider the consequences of a long -lived    increase in the cost of credit 
5:155:11234:21:21:71:543:111:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in a setting where wages are sticky in the short run. Initially, higher loan rates will lead to a 
5:156:11332:21:0:71:542:90:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:temporary spike in unemployment. Then as wages gradually adjust, the effect on unemployment 
6:157:11426:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:will dissipate. However, if credit remains expensive, one would expect firms to become less capital 
6:158:11526:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:intensive over time, leading to a lower marginal product of labor. Thus, the longer-run equilibrium 
6:159:11626:21:21:72:303:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:involves a persistent negative impact on wages. 
6:160:11673:21:20:108:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We next show that the composition of small business lenders in high Top 4 counties 
6:161:11756:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes significantly from 2008 to 2014, potentially explaining why the cost of credit remains 
6:162:11851:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:higher in these areas. As noted above, the annual flow   of small business originations by all banks 
6:163:11951:21:20:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:largely recovers in high Top 4 counties by 2014. This is in large part because small banks—those 
6:164:12048:20:21:72:542:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with assets less than $50 billion—grow their originations faster in affected counties from 2010 to 
6:165:12147:21:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2014, filling some   of the gap left by the Top 4 banks. Using the PayNet data, we also find that 
6:166:12245:21:21:71:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:non-bank finance companies and  alternative small business lenders—non-banks who lend via 
6:167:12335:21:20:72:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:online web-based platforms—grow most    rapidly in high Top 4 counties from 2010 to 2014. While 
6:168:12431:20:21:72:543:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these non-bank lenders are responding to a legitimate shortfall in credit supply, they may be 
6:169:12525:21:21:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:relatively expensive marginal providers of credit, perhaps because they face higher funding costs 
6:170:12622:21:20:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than banks. Thus, the adjustment process in high Top 4 counties seems to be imperfect, involving 
6:171:12719:20:21:72:339:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a persistent impact on the cost of small business credit. 
6:172:12777:21:21:108:548:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The validity of our   difference-in-differences approach rests on a  parallel trends assumption: 
6:173:12874:21:20:71:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes in high Top 4 counties would have evolved similarly to those in otherwise similar low 
6:174:12969:20:21:72:543:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Top 4 counties had the former not been hit by a  credit supply shock. In other words, we are 
6:175:13062:21:21:72:542:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assuming that, conditional on a large set of controls, a county’s initial exposure to Top 4 banks is 
6:176:13163:21:20:72:542:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:uncorrelated with local credit demand shocks, local credit supply shocks affecting non-Top 4 
6:177:13256:20:21:72:440:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lenders, and any other omitted determinants of local labor market outcomes. 
6:178:13331:21:21:108:543:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We offer several pieces of evidence in support of this assumption. First, we show that 
6:179:13418:21:21:72:543:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit-market conditions and labor-market conditions evolved similarly in high and low Top 4 
6:180:13511:21:20:72:542:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties from 2000 to 2007, before diverging dramatically in 2008, precisely when the Top 4 
6:181:13603:20:21:72:562:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:began to aggressively pull back from small business lending. Second, we find that the    initial 
6:182:13700:21:21:72:543:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:decline in total small business lending in high Top 4 counties from 2006 to 2010 is entirely 
6:183:13793:21:20:72:543:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:explained by the Top 4 banks: smaller banks in these areas were behaving similarly to smaller 
6:184:13886:20:21:72:542:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks elsewhere. Third  , we present a series of triple-difference results that zoom in further on the 
6:185:13989:21:21:71:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit-supply mechanism. Looking within high Top 4 counties, we show that the employment 
6:186:14078:21:20:72:542:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effects  are  concentrated  in  industries  that  are  most  dependent  on  external  finance,  such  as 
6:187:14183:20:0:72:552:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing. And, looking across high Top 4 counties, we find that the  employment effects are  
7:188:14283:0:20:72:552:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:more pronounced in the subset of counties that are  most dependent on small business employers. 
7:189:14379:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, our    results using the proprietary PayNet data seem uniquely consistent wi th the idea that 
7:190:14482:21:21:72:582:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:there was a credit supply shock from the Top 4 banks: the    total    volume of lending in high Top 4 
7:191:14584:21:20:72:540:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties declines, the cost of credit rises, and small business borrowers substitute towards non-
7:192:14681:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Top 4 lenders. Taken together, we believe that this    constellation of  findings helps to buttress the 
7:193:14785:21:21:72:269:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:validity of our basic empirical approach. 
7:194:14826:21:20:107:557:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Our   paper contributes  to  four    strands of the   literature. First, there is a large body of research 
7:195:14933:20:21:71:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that studies the real effects of credit supply shocks.2 Relative to this work, our novel contribution 
7:196:15035:21:21:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is to    focus less on the short   -run impact of a shock, and more on the long-run dynamic adjustment 
7:197:15138:21:21:72:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:process. Specifically, we document how labor-market outcomes like unemployment and wages 
7:198:15227:21:20:72:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:respond over time to a persistent contraction in bank loan supply, as well as how this labor-market 
7:199:15327:20:21:72:542:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:behavior is related to the entry of non-bank lenders. What we find most striking here is how, even 
7:200:15426:21:21:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:after a number of years, the process of filling in the gap left by the Top 4 banks appears to be 
7:201:15523:21:20:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:incomplete. This gradual adjustment process may reflect a slow -moving capital dynamic, whereby 
7:202:15619:20:21:72:543:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other lenders are not easily able to raise the equity needed to expand their lending (Myers and 
7:203:15715:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Majluf [1984]).  Alternatively, it  may point to the importance of information-intensive banking 
7:204:15812:21:20:71:396:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:relationships that, once severed, are hard to rebuild (Rajan [1992]). 
7:205:15882:20:21:107:542:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Second,  there  is  a  set  of  papers  which  argues  that  credit  markets  played  a  role  in 
7:206:15980:21:21:72:543:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:precipitating and amplifying the Great Recession.3 Here our approach is particularly close to that 
7:207:16079:21:20:71:565:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of  Bord, Ivashina, and Taliaferro (2017). They find   that  geographically diversified banks that were 
7:208:16183:20:21:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:most exposed to declining house prices cut their small business lending relative to other less-
7:209:16278:21:21:71:543:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:exposed banks operating in the same counties, even in those counties where real estate prices did 
7:210:16376:21:21:71:539:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not fall. Thus, like us, they seek to identify a shock to small business credit supply using county-
7:211:16476:21:20:71:543:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level data. One important distinction is that our strategy relies entirely on the differential behavior 
7:212:16580:20:37:71:557:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of Top 4 banks versus all others, whereas their results are robust to excluding the largest ten   banks

8:223:17553:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:complementarity in mind when thinking about the aggregate implications of both our results and 
8:224:17648:21:20:72:554:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:those of Bord et al (2017). For example, while our identification strategy leads us to focus narro  wly 
8:225:17752:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on the relative supply shift by the Top 4 banks, we know that small business lending by all banks 
8:226:17850:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fell dramatically in the wake of the financial crisis. If, based on evidence like that in Bord et al 
8:227:17951:21:20:71:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(2017), one believes that some of this drop reflects a more broad-based contraction in loan supply 
8:228:18049:20:21:72:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coming from other sources of variation, an extrapolation of our estimates and theirs would suggest 
8:229:18148:21:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that the small business credit gap may have contributed significantly to  the   severity of the Great 
8:230:18250:21:21:71:364:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Recession and the sluggish pace of the subsequent recovery. 
8:231:18310:21:20:107:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Third  , to the extent that regulation played a role in the Top 4 banks’ reluctance to re-enter 
8:232:18406:20:21:71:578:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the small-business market once the crisis had subsided, our findings reinforce the view    that    one of 
8:233:18512:21:21:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the   consequences of heightened bank regulation may be to drive activity to the less-regulated, non-
8:234:18613:21:20:71:542:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bank sector.4 In particular, it may be that some of the rapid growth of alternative, online lenders 
8:235:18713:20:21:72:562:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in recent years is due not only   to the appeal of their web-based platforms, but also    to a simple 
8:236:18815:21:21:71:543:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regulatory arbitrage: they can lend to small businesses without incurring much of the regulatory 
8:237:18912:21:20:71:301:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:overhead that traditional banks must shoulder.5 
8:238:18959:20:21:108:543:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, and most speculatively, our findings may shed some light on the weak productivity 
8:239:19050:21:21:71:581:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:growth in the decade since the crisis. Many authors have suggested that   some   of   the productivity 
8:240:19153:21:20:72:543:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:slowdown may be due to declining small business vibrancy.6 While we would not want to claim 
8:241:19244:20:21:72:542:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that our results can account for the lion’s share of the productivity phenomenon—much of which 
8:242:19339:21:21:71:542:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:appears to be more secular in nature—it does seem possible that a contraction in bank credit supply 
8:243:19439:21:21:71:334:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to small business could have played a supporting role. 
8:244:19494:21:20:107:563:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The plan for the rest of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we document that    there was a 
8:245:19591:20:35:71:543:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:large    differential contraction in the supply of small business credit from   the    Top 4 U.S. banks 
8:246:19695:35:19:72:219:177:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
8:247:19744:19:15:72:542:158:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:4 The potential for this unintended consequence of heightened regulation is emphasized by Acharya and Richardson 
8:248:19857:15:10:71:535:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:(2009), Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011), Acharya, Schnabl, Suarez (2013), and Begenau and Landvoigt (2016). 
8:249:19966:10:15:72:542:133:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:5 Relatedly, Buchak, Matvos, Piskorski, and   Seru   (2017) show that non-bank lenders have also gained significant 
8:250:20082:15:11:71:542:118:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:market share in residential mortgage lending since the financial crisis, and they present evidence linking the rise of 
8:251:20201:11:10:71:433:107:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:non-   bank mortgage lenders to the heightened regulations now faced by traditional banks.

9:254:20456:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2014; we also discuss some of the possible causes of 
9:255:20550:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this pullback. Section III  explains our identification strategy for assessing the dynamic impact of 
9:256:20651:21:21:72:552:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this  supply shock on local    credit and labor markets. Section IV details the  data sources we use in

9:261:20943:21:20:107:345:570:144:Times:144:Times:A:A. Identifying the relative shock to credit supply 
9:262:20993:20:21:107:539:550:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:As noted above, and as can be seen in Figure 1 and Panel A of Table 1, the Top 4 banks—
9:263:21080:21:21:72:542:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:those owned by Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo—significantly cut their 
9:264:21174:21:20:72:543:508:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small business lending relative to other U.S.    banks beginning in 2008. We first demonstrate that 
9:265:21274:20:21:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this is truly a big bank effect: the    reduction in lending by the Top 4 goes beyond what one would 
9:266:21375:21:21:72:543:467:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expect based on their other observable characteristics. To see this, Panel A of Table 2 presents 
9:267:21472:21:24:72:320:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bank-level  , cross-sectional regressions of the form:

9:269:21563:25:22:108:543:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The dependent variable in equation (1) is    the percentage point change in bank b’s small 
9:270:21654:22:21:72:542:375:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business loan originations from 2006 to 2010. We are interested in the coefficient β on the indicator 
9:271:21756:21:20:71:542:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for   Top 4 banks, denoted T4b. Column (1) reports the coefficient from a univariate regression of 
9:272:21855:20:21:72:542:334:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006–2010 origination growth on the Top 4 indicator. The estimate implies that small business 
9:273:21949:21:21:72:556:313:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending by the Top 4 fell by 31.6 percentage points (“p.p.”) relative to other banks. In c  olumn (2), 
9:274:22051:21:21:71:543:292:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:we control for a set of bank-level   characteristics from the Call Reports, including a bank’s funding 
9:275:22154:21:20:71:543:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mix (its fraction of deposit funding and its fraction of wholesale funding), pre-crisis asset growth, 
9:276:22256:20:21:71:543:251:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:C&I charge-offs during the crisis, exposure to real estate loans, and initial equity capital ratios. 
9:277:22357:21:21:71:543:230:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The inclusion of these controls has only a small effect on the   coefficient on the Top 4 indicator 
9:278:22456:21:20:72:191:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which falls to –26.4 p.p. 
9:279:22482:20:21:108:542:189:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We next compare the Top 4 banks to “small banks”—those with assets under $50 billion 
9:280:22567:21:21:72:543:168:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in 2005—and “other larger banks” excluding the Top 4—those with 2005 assets between $50 
9:281:22655:21:20:72:543:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:billion and $500 billion. To do so, in columns (3) and (4), we include indicator variables for both 
9:282:22755:20:21:72:543:127:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Top 4 and for other large banks A50to500b, so small banks serve as the omitted category. The 
9:283:22852:21:21:71:542:106:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates in column (4) imply that, all else equal, the originations of the Top 4 shrank by 38.2 p.p. 
9:284:22954:21:0:71:543:85:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:relative to small banks, while those of other large banks fell by 15.4 p.p. relative to small banks. 
10:285:23057:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Furthermore, the 22.8 p.p. difference between the Top 4 and other large banks is large in magnitude 
10:286:23156:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and statistically significant at the 1% level. Thus, columns (3) and (4) suggest that while the 
10:287:23252:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contraction in small business lending is a function of bank size more generally, the very largest 
10:288:23350:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks—the Top 4—withdrew by considerably more than even “super-regional” banks with assets 
10:289:23441:20:21:72:221:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:between $50 and $500 billion. 
10:290:23471:21:21:108:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:What explains these differences? One possibility is that they reflect differences in loan 
10:291:23561:21:20:72:549:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand, or in  borrower creditworthiness, as opposed to differential changes in credit supply. For  
10:292:23661:20:21:72:540:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:example, Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of the Top 4 deposit share in a given market—
10:293:23758:21:21:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:denoted  by T4DSc—across counties  in  the  lower  48  states.  The  population-weighted average 
10:294:23855:21:21:71:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:county has a T4DSc of 30%. However, there are clear regional patterns in Top 4 presence, with 
10:295:23949:21:20:72:542:501:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:T4DSc averaging 25% in the Northeast census region, 29% in the South, 15% in the Midwest, and 
10:296:24043:20:21:72:542:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:50% in the West. Since T4DSc is not randomly distributed across regions, our findings in Panel A 
10:297:24140:21:21:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of Table 2 could just be capturing the   fact that the Top 4 operated in areas that were harder hit by 
10:298:24243:21:20:72:457:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Great Recession and, therefore, experienced larger declines in loan demand. 
10:299:24322:20:21:108:542:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:To address this concern, in Panel B of Table 2, we use CRA data on small business loan 
10:300:24409:21:24:71:435:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f4:B:originations at the bank-county level to estimate specifications of the form:

10:306:24893:21:21:107:568:265:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Interestingly, the estimated coefficients on T4b in Panel B are similar to the raw  a cross   -
10:307:24988:21:20:71:564:244:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bank estimates in Panel A and, if anything, are  slightly larger in absolute magnitude. This    suggests 
10:308:25093:20:21:71:543:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that the difference in loan growth between the Top 4 and other banks was indeed due to a relative 
10:309:25191:21:21:71:543:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supply  shock,  as  opposed  to  differential  exposure  to  negative  demand  shocks.  And,  as  we 
10:310:25292:21:20:71:542:182:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:emphasize below, the fact that the estimates in Panels A and B of Table 2 are similar helps to

11:323:26264:21:21:108:543:516:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Observers offer    a consistent story to explain the Top 4’s withdrawal from small business 
11:324:26356:21:20:72:542:495:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending in 2008. Prior to the crisis, this segment was only a modest portion of the Top 4’s total 
11:325:26454:20:21:72:542:475:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loan portfolios. For instance, based on mid  -2006 Call Report data, small business loans represented 
11:326:26556:21:21:72:559:454:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:only   4% of total outstanding loans at the Top 4, compared to 9%   of loans at other large banks with 
11:327:26659:21:20:72:543:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:assets between $50 and $500 billion, and 22% of loans at small banks with assets under $50 billion. 
11:328:26759:20:21:72:543:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This pattern has been rationalized by noting that, relative to smaller banks, large banks are at a 
11:329:26857:21:21:72:543:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:disadvantage in gathering and  acting on the kind of non-quantitative, “soft” information that is so 
11:330:26958:21:20:72:542:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:useful when assessing the creditworthiness of small firms    (Stein [2002], Berger and Udell [2002],

11:333:27173:21:20:108:542:309:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:However,  from   2000 to  2007, large  banks  began  relying  more  heavily  on  automated 
11:334:27264:20:21:72:549:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:systems—similar to those used  in consumer and residential mortgage lending—to underwrite 
11:335:27354:21:21:72:543:268:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small  business  loans based  solely  on  quantitative,  “hard”  information (Carroll  and  Hoffman 
11:336:27454:21:21:72:542:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:[2013],  Mills  and  McCarthy  [2014]).  These  automated underwriting systems  combined 
11:337:27543:21:20:72:543:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:information on the business owner’s consumer credit score and, where available, a commercial 
11:338:27636:20:21:72:542:206:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit score. The hope was that moving to an automated system would lower processing costs and 
11:339:27731:21:59:72:542:185:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:improve underwriting quality. With the aid of   these automated systems, the Top 4 banks gained

12:343:28082:20:21:72:366:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:approximately 20% of originations in 2000 to 33% in 2006.8 
12:344:28140:21:21:108:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:But as the U.S. economy decelerated from mid-2007 to late    2008, big banks experienced 
12:345:28229:21:20:71:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:high charge-off   rates on their small business loan portfolios. Furthermore, they realized that the 
12:346:28330:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:transition to automated underwriting had not significantly lowered costs or improved underwriting 
12:347:28428:21:24:71:386:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:quality.9 For example, according to Mills and McCarthy (2014):  
12:348:28492:24:14:108:545:581:144:Times:144:Times:A:“Bank  of  America,  which  used  credit  scoring  to  make  ...  loans  of  less  than  $150,000  
12:349:28591:14:13:108:543:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:through 2007, suffered significant losses in the recession and eventually exited that market 
12:350:28684:13:23:108:515:554:144:Times:144:Times:A:segment due in part to poor loans underwritten largely based on credit score data.” 
12:351:28768:23:21:108:543:531:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:By   lat e 2008, the Top 4 banks were facing huge losses in their core lending and capital 
12:352:28859:21:21:71:543:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:markets divisions, threatening their solvency and leading to intense wholesale funding pressures. 
12:353:28956:21:20:72:542:489:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Executives at these banks needed to stabilize core    business lines, rebuild equity capital buffers,

12:355:29155:21:21:71:540:448:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pull  ed back from small business lending—a non-core unit where they were already struggling—
12:356:29248:21:23:71:512:427:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to focus on weathering the storm.10 For example, according to Mills and McCarthy (2014): 
12:357:29337:23:14:108:542:404:144:Times:144:Times:A:“Some banks, particularly larger banks... significantly reduced or eliminated loans below 
12:358:29427:14:14:108:543:390:144:Times:144:Times:A:a certain threshold, typically $100,000 or $250,000, or simply [would] not lend to small 
12:359:29516:14:23:108:359:376:144:Times:144:Times:A:businesses with revenue of less than $2 million ....” 
12:360:29570:23:20:108:542:353:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:To illustrate the economic logic behind this sort of decision, consider a stylized example 
12:361:29661:20:21:72:542:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with    two banks, where Bank A is a mid  -size  regional player primarily involved in traditional 
12:362:29760:21:21:71:542:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:commercial banking activities, while Bank B is a Top 4 megabank that also is involved in a wide 
12:363:29856:21:20:71:542:291:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:range of other capital markets and investment banking lines of business. Now suppose both banks 
12:364:29952:20:21:71:543:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:see the profitability of their small-bus iness lending unit decline by the same amount due to changes 
12:365:30054:21:21:71:543:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in  the  macroeconomic  environment  or increased regulation. Even  in  the  face  of  this  sort  of 
12:366:30156:21:29:71:542:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:symmetric shock, which bank might be expected to cut back on small business lending by more? 
12:367:30249:29:19:72:219:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
12:368:30298:19:15:72:542:181:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:8 We calculate market share using CRA data. To ensure comparability over time, we adjust the historical series for all 
12:369:30417:15:11:72:551:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:subsequent acquisitions by the Top 4 banks. Furthermore, since the bank   asset size threshold for CRA reporting 
12:370:30530:11:12:71:542:155:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:increased from $250 million in 2004 to $1 billion in 2005, we exclude banks with fewer than $1 billion in assets before 
12:371:30650:12:10:71:116:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2005.     
12:372:30660:10:15:72:542:133:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:9 Processing costs did not fall much because large banks only used automatic systems to decide the most obvious cases 
12:373:30778:15:11:72:542:118:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:and continued to use a high-cost, manual process to decide the rest. And, underwriting quality did not improve because 
12:374:30897:11:10:72:532:107:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:automated models were not particularly good at forecasting small business defaults (Carroll and Hoffman [2013]). 
12:375:31009:10:15:72:547:97:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:10  Observers  told  us  that  the  large  banks  mostly  shut  down  their  automated  underwriting  systems,  routed  all 
12:376:31133:15:0:71:473:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:applications through their manual systems, and significantly tightened their underwriting standards. 
13:377:31236:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Assuming that banks don’t return capital to shareholders—so that their capital base is fixed in the 
13:378:31336:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:short run—it should be megabank B. Megabank B has a broader set of other available opportunities 
13:379:31433:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in its internal capital market to which it can reallocate capital if it exits small business lending. By 
13:380:31538:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, for the regional bank A, it is harder to exit small business lending if it wants to maintain 
13:381:31641:20:27:72:546:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:its   current size,    because it faces a more limited set of opportunities in reallocating capital internally.  
13:382:31754:27:21:108:336:599:144:Times:144:Times:A:B.2. Phase 2: The slow rebound, 2010-2014 
13:383:31795:21:20:108:543:578:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:As shown in Table 1, small business lending at the Top 4 banks rebounded modestly after 
13:384:31883:20:21:72:543:558:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2010,  growing by  19%  from  2010  to  2014. However,  since the  Top  4  had  cut lending so 
13:385:31978:21:21:72:542:537:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:aggressively from 2006 to 2010, one might have expected a stronger recovery. Indeed, originations 
13:386:32076:21:21:72:552:516:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:grew by 34% from 2010 to 2014 at small banks with assets under $50 billion, even though they  
13:387:32170:21:20:72:262:495:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:had cut lending by far less in the crisis. 
13:388:32212:20:21:108:543:475:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Several factors may    help to explain why the Top 4 did not jump back into small business 
13:389:32303:21:21:72:543:454:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending once the crisis had passed. One    possibility is that the rapid growth in small business 
13:390:32401:21:20:72:542:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending at the Top 4 banks in the years prior to the crisis was a boom-time over-extension of 
13:391:32495:20:21:72:542:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit—something akin to what occurred in the residential mortgage sector, albeit on a much 
13:392:32587:21:21:72:543:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:smaller scale. And, having been disappointed with their ill-fated expansion into small business 
13:393:32683:21:20:72:539:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit and particularly their foray into automated underwriting, the largest banks permanently re-
13:394:32781:20:21:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evaluated  their  comparat ive    advantage  in  this  area  following  the  crisis.  In  this  telling, while 
13:395:32892:21:21:72:543:330:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:perhaps painful, the post-2007 decline in small business lending at the Top 4 banks was a necessary 
13:396:32991:21:20:72:257:309:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:corrective to these pre-crisis excesses. 
13:397:33031:20:21:108:539:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Another possibility is that the slow rebound was in part a consequence of heightened post-
13:398:33121:21:21:72:543:268:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:crisis financial regulation. Even as late as 2014, a significant fraction of senior managers’ time at 
13:399:33223:21:21:72:543:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the  largest  banks  was  being  consumed  by  the  need  to  comply  with  the  array  of  heightened 
13:400:33326:21:20:71:542:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regulations that had gone into effect following the crisis—Basel III’s new capital and liquidity 
13:401:33423:20:21:71:551:206:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rules, the Federal Reserve’s annual bank stress tests, the preparation of so-called “living wills,”  to 
13:402:33527:21:21:71:542:185:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:name   but    a few. This left less bandwidth to devote to the task of reimagining a struggling peripheral 
13:403:33634:21:20:71:289:164:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business line such as small business lending. 
13:404:33679:20:21:107:543:144:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:More directly, in the wake of the crisis, effective capital requirements have gone up not 
13:405:33769:21:21:71:543:123:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:only in absolute terms, but also by more for the very    largest banks. Those  banks that are deemed 
13:406:33870:21:0:71:543:102:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to be globally systemically significant, such as the Top 4 banks, face capital surcharges, forcing 
14:407:33972:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:them to maintain higher capital ratios against all  risky assets relative to other banks.11 Moreover, 
14:408:34074:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the implicit risk weights for small business loans in particular may have increased at large banks 
14:409:34173:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in recent years. This would be the case to the extent that the   stress  -testing regime that the Federal 
14:410:34279:21:20:71:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Reserve now applies to banks with assets over $50 billion make   s  relatively severe assumptions 
14:411:34377:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:about the losses on small business loans in  an  economic downturn.12 While heightened capital 
14:412:34472:21:21:71:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:charges are arguably a well   -justified component of the post-crisis efforts to reduce the systemic 
14:413:34573:21:20:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:risk posed by the very largest banks, they may have some chilling effect on the amount of riskier 
14:414:34671:20:21:71:366:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lending—e.g., small business lending—done by these banks. 
14:415:34729:21:21:107:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, it is possible that Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations may    have played a role 
14:416:34820:21:21:72:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as well. Loosely speaking, these rules require banks to verify their customers’ identities and to 
14:417:34918:21:20:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:monitor their activi   ty for suspicious transactions, with the aim of reducing financial fraud and 
14:418:35018:20:21:71:543:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:money laundering. Some observers have suggested that the enforcement of these rules, and the 
14:419:35111:21:21:71:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:size of the associated penalties, have become tougher for big banks, in comparison to both   the pre-
14:420:35212:21:20:71:543:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:crisis    period and to smaller banks. KYC compliance costs are incurred when a bank enters into 
14:421:35309:20:21:71:543:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:any relationship with a small business, and are not specific to just len ding. Yet    to the extent that 
14:422:35414:21:21:71:530:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:they are meaningful, they might be expected to affect the economics of small business lending. 
14:423:35509:21:20:107:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Given  the  short  time  series  we  are  unable  to  distinguish  between  these  competing 
14:424:35602:20:21:71:542:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:explanations for  the post-crisis decline in small business lending at the Top 4 banks. That is, we 
14:425:35702:21:21:71:542:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cannot say whether it was an unintended consequence of heightened regulation or a return to the 
14:426:35798:21:20:71:539:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:normal, pre-boom state of affairs. However, we will  argue that one particular aspect of the credit-
14:427:35898:20:21:71:542:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:boom story  —that high Top 4 counties had a larger aggregate increase in small business lending 
14:428:35994:21:21:71:496:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than low Top 4 counties in the pre-crisis period—appears to be unsupported in the data. 
14:429:36082:21:21:107:110:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:

14:432:36131:19:15:72:547:191:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:11 Specifically,  since the Top 4 banks qualify as Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), they are required  to 
14:433:36249:15:12:71:544:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:have   additional Tier 1 common equity relative to risk-weighted assets. The current surcharges are 3.5% for JP M organ, 
14:434:36370:12:10:71:371:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:3% for C   itigroup, 3% for B ank of America, and 2% for Wells   Fargo . 
14:435:36443:10:15:72:542:154:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:12 An important qualification is that we cannot observe these stress-test loss assumptions separately for small business 
14:436:36564:15:11:71:542:139:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:loans as opposed to the broader category of all commercial and industrial lending. See however The Clearing House 
14:437:36678:11:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:(2017) for an analysis that attempts to indirectly infer the stress-test implied risk weights on small-business loans. 
14:438:36797:12:11:71:542:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Going further, several observers with ties to the financial industry have argued that the tougher bank capital regulations 
14:439:36920:11:12:71:541:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:adopted in the wake of the crisis have contributed to the slow growth of small business lending, particularly at the 
14:440:37037:12:11:71:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:largest banks, potentially helping to explain why employment growth at small firms has lagged behind that at larger 
14:441:37153:11:0:71:542:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:firms during the post-crisis recovery. See, for example, The Clearing House (2017) and Strongin et al. (2014, 2015).

15:443:37348:20:21:108:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:To   assess the   impact of the credit supply shock on local credit and labor markets, we use a 
15:444:37444:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:difference-in-difference strategy that compares outcomes in counties where the Top 4 banks had a 
15:445:37541:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:large   r  initial market share to those in observably similar counties where they had a smaller share. 
15:446:37644:20:28:72:405:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This   empirical strategy rests on two key identifying assumptions: 
15:447:37712:28:16:90:542:598:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• First stage assumption: Because of the relative credit supply shift from the Top 4 banks, 
15:448:37803:16:16:108:542:582:144:Times:144:Times:A:a county’s initial Top 4 share is negatively related to the subsequent growth in aggregate 
15:449:37894:16:23:108:297:566:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:small business lending in that county. 
15:450:37932:23:15:89:543:543:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Parallel trends / Exclusion restriction assumption: Conditional on a set of county-level 
15:451:38022:15:16:108:543:528:144:Times:144:Times:A:observables, a county’s initial Top 4 share is uncorrelated with (i) local credit demand 
15:452:38111:16:16:108:547:512:144:Times:144:Times:A:shocks,  (ii)  local  credit  supply  shocks  affecting  other  lenders,  and  (iii)  omitted  
15:453:38206:16:16:108:543:496:144:Times:144:Times:A:determinants  of  local  real  outcomes.  Thus,  credit  and  labor  market  outcomes  in  high  
15:454:38303:16:16:108:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:A:and low Top 4 counties would have evolved similarly in the absence of the relative credit 
15:455:38393:16:22:108:286:464:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:supply shock from the Top 4 banks. 
15:456:38427:22:20:72:542:442:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Assuming that these identifying assumptions hold, then our difference-in-difference estimates will 
15:457:38526:20:21:72:239:422:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have a valid causal interpretation.  
15:458:38562:21:21:108:543:401:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We    test  four difference-in-difference (DD)   predictions  in  the  cross-section  of  U.S. 
15:459:38657:21:27:72:118:380:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties: 
15:460:38667:27:16:90:542:353:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DD1: There is a negative relationship between a county’s initial Top 4 share 
15:461:38756:16:23:108:519:337:144:Times:144:Times:A:and the subsequent growth in total small business loan originations in that county. 
15:462:38839:23:16:90:542:314:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DD2: There is a negative relationship between a county’s initial Top 4 share 
15:463:38928:16:16:108:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:A:and  subsequent  county-level labor-market  outcomes,  including  employment and  wage 
15:464:39015:16:21:108:151:282:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:growth.  
15:465:39023:21:21:72:543:261:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Note that by combining Predictions DD1    and DD2, we can    obtain an instrumental-variables (IV) 
15:466:39122:21:28:72:484:240:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimate of the impact of a small business credit supply shock on local labor markets. 
15:467:39209:28:16:90:547:212:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DD3: There is a positive relationship between a county’s   initial Top 4 share 
15:468:39300:16:21:108:509:196:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:and subsequent changes in interest rates on small business loans in that county.  
15:469:39381:21:21:108:542:175:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Combining Predictions DD1 and DD3 yields an IV estimate of semi-elasticity of loan 
15:470:39464:21:21:72:542:154:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand with respect to interest rates. Although we primarily focus on results from reduced-form 
15:471:39560:21:21:72:543:133:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:specifications, we take comfort from the fact that the corresponding IV estimate—the ratio of 
15:472:39654:21:20:72:539:112:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients from the reduced-form and the first-stage specifications—implies a plausible semi-
15:473:39749:20:0:72:293:92:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity of demand for small business loans. 
16:474:39799:0:15:90:542:707:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DD4: There is a positive relationship between a county’s initial Top 4 share 
16:475:39888:15:16:108:543:692:144:Times:144:Times:A:and subsequent small business loan growth for other, non-Top 4 lenders in that county, 
16:476:39975:16:22:108:430:676:144:Times:144:Times:A:including smaller banks, finance companies, and online lenders. 
16:477:40038:22:21:72:543:654:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Combining Predictions DD3 and DD4, we can obtain an IV estimate of the semi-elasticity of loan 
16:478:40133:21:20:71:542:633:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supply for these other lenders. And, as above, we will draw comfort from the fact that the implied 
16:479:40232:20:21:72:298:613:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:semi   -elasticity of loan supply seems plausible. 
16:480:40282:21:21:108:543:592:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In addition, finding evidence consistent with Predictions DD3 and DD4 supports the view 
16:481:40370:21:21:72:542:571:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that   any  negative impact on local    economic outcomes such as business growth and employment is 
16:482:40470:21:20:71:543:550:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:due to a  Top 4 credit supply shock rather than to  a failure of the exclusion restriction. For example, 
16:483:40575:20:21:71:542:530:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suppose one is  worried that a county’s initial Top 4 share is correlated with negative shocks to 
16:484:40673:21:21:72:542:509:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:local economic fundamentals and, thus, to loan demand, which could explain why Predictions DD1 
16:485:40768:21:20:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and DD2 hold in the data. In this case, we would also expect to find a decline in interest rates and 
16:486:40869:20:21:72:423:468:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:slower loan growth at other non-Top 4 lenders in high Top 4 counties.13  
16:487:40942:21:21:108:542:447:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:However, even if we do find   evidence supporting each of  Predictions DD1 through DD4, 
16:488:41030:21:20:72:543:426:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one    may    still ask whether exposure to the   Top 4 banks impacts local   labor market outcomes 
16:489:41130:20:21:72:543:406:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through a narrow small business credit supply channel of the sort we have in mind, or through a 
16:490:41226:21:21:72:542:385:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:broader credit supply channel. The small business credit channel is the idea that an inward shift in 
16:491:41327:21:20:72:543:364:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the supply of credit to small    businesses had a direct negative impact on local labor markets.14 
16:492:41425:20:21:72:566:344:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, there may also be a broader credit channel because, while the  Top 4 cut  their    lending to 
16:493:41528:21:21:71:542:323:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small businesses sharply beginning in 2008, their loan growth has also been stagnant in other 
16:494:41622:21:21:72:543:302:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:categories, including residential mortgage and consumer lending. So a contraction in  the  supply of 
16:495:41723:21:20:72:543:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:household credit from   Top 4 banks may also    have reduced consumer demand in affected counties, 
16:496:41822:20:21:72:543:261:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:leading to adverse effects on local    employment even in the absence of a direct small business credit 
16:497:41926:21:30:72:115:240:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:channel. 
16:498:41935:30:19:72:219:210:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
16:499:41984:19:15:72:542:191:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:13 When considering the impact on interest rates, it is important to  hold expected default losses constant.  Otherwise, 
16:500:42105:15:12:71:542:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:if weak local fundamentals were associated with higher expected credit losses, one might expect a county with poor 
16:501:42220:12:11:71:554:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:fundamentals to have both   low loan growth and higher raw interest rates. Thus, we take care to control for loan credit 
16:502:42341:11:10:71:322:153:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:quality (measured by the average credit score) in each county. 
16:503:42404:10:15:72:542:143:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:14 Of course, the impact on labor markets is unlikely to be caused exclusively by an inward shift in the supply of 
16:504:42519:15:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:business loans with amounts less than $1 million—the literal regulatory definition of small business loans. If the Top 
16:505:42638:12:11:71:549:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:4 are cutting back on their supply of business loans less than $1 million, then they are  also likely to be cutting back 
16:506:42759:11:12:71:542:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:on their supply of loans between $1 and $20 million to medium-sized businesses. Indeed, based on data on outstanding 
16:507:42876:12:11:71:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:commercial  loan  balances  from  Call  Reports,  we find    that  commercial  loan  growth  at  the  Top  4  has lagged 
16:508:42997:11:0:71:542:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:significantly behind that at smaller banks—both for loans under $1 million and for loans over $1 million—since 2007. 
17:509:43116:0:20:108:551:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:To help distinguish between these stories, we use triple-difference specifications to   test 
17:510:43209:20:28:72:522:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:three   further predictions that are unique to the narrower small business credit supply channel: 
17:511:43307:28:16:90:542:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DDD1: Looking across high Top 4 counties, the negative employment effects 
17:512:43393:16:16:108:542:644:144:Times:144:Times:A:should be most pronounced in the subset of counties that were initially more dependent 
17:513:43480:16:22:108:254:628:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:on small business employers. 
17:514:43508:22:16:90:542:606:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DDD2: Looking within high Top 4 counties, the negative employment effects 
17:515:43594:16:22:108:519:590:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:should be concentrated in industries that are more dependent on external finance.  
17:516:43675:22:21:72:542:568:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Importantly, Prediction DDD2 can be tested exploiting only within-county variation. This helps 
17:517:43770:21:20:72:543:547:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:address any concerns about the failure of the exclusion restriction due to unobserved differential 
17:518:43869:20:21:72:225:527:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand trends across counties. 
17:519:43899:21:21:108:542:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Furthermore, since small firm s in tradable industries such as manufacturing tend to be more 
17:520:43992:21:21:71:543:485:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reliant on external finance than small firms in non-tradable industries like    retail and restaurants, 
17:521:44096:21:27:72:427:464:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this  suggests that our employment results should be stronger in tradables: 
17:522:44172:27:16:90:542:437:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:A:• Prediction DDD3: Looking within high Top 4 counties, the negative employment effects 
17:523:44258:16:22:108:435:421:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:A:should be stronger in tradable industries such as manufacturing.  
17:524:44322:22:20:72:542:399:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:And given that employment in tradables is less exposed to shifts in local demand than employment 
17:525:44419:20:21:71:543:379:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in non-tradables (Mian and Sufi [2014]), finding evidence in favor of Prediction DDD3 would cut 
17:526:44515:21:21:71:543:358:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:against an interpretation of our results in which credit-induced shifts in household demand play a 
17:527:44614:21:27:71:127:337:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:major role.

17:530:44642:21:21:107:546:269:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We carry out much of  our analysis using a panel data set that consists of annual, county-
17:531:44732:21:32:71:528:248:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level observations. This section describes the main data sources we use to construct this panel. 
17:532:44829:32:21:107:262:216:144:Times:144:Times:A:A. Small business lending data 
17:533:44859:21:21:107:551:195:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Our data on  small business loan originations in each U.S. county are  derived from the 
17:534:44947:21:20:71:543:174:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) database. Any federally-regulated depository institution 
17:535:45037:20:21:71:543:154:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whose assets exceed $1 billion in  2005 dollars is required to file a CRA report. Small business 
17:536:45134:21:21:71:548:133:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loans are loans    with an original amount of $1 million or less that   are reported as either “c ommercial 
17:537:45242:21:21:71:543:112:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and industrial loans” or    “loans secured by nonfarm or nonresidential real estate” on an institution’s 
17:538:45347:21:0:71:542:91:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Call  Report. The concept of originations in the CRA database includes renewals and refinancings 
18:539:45447:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as well as de novo ori ginations. Furthermore, the data includes both term loans and credit line 
18:540:45542:20:21:72:479:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:approvals. In the latter case, the origination amount equals the size of the credit line. 
18:541:45631:21:21:108:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We obtain data on lending terms, as well as on lending volumes by non-bank finance 
18:542:45714:21:20:71:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:companies and online lenders, from   PayNet’s proprietary loan-level database. PayNet maintains a 
18:543:45812:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:private business credit registry that aggregates and analyzes data collected from over 300 member 
18:544:45910:21:21:71:557:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lenders,  including  banks  and  non-bank  institutions.  The  PayNet  data  base  is the    largest  U.S. 
18:545:46017:21:20:71:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:database of small business loans, leases, and credit lines, including over 23 million credit contracts 
18:546:46120:20:21:71:429:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and totaling more than $1.4 trillion in loans outstanding as of this writing. 
18:547:46198:21:21:107:554:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The PayNet data consists of a    loan-  level    panel that follows loan contracts over time, and   a 
18:548:46300:21:21:72:547:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:borrower-level    panel dataset. The identities of individual borrowers and lenders  were anonymized 
18:549:46401:21:20:72:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in the dataset used for this research. The    loan-   level panel includes the lender type—we know 
18:550:46500:20:21:72:543:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whether  the  lender  is  a  bank, a  finance  company,  or  an  online  lender—and various  loan 
18:551:46598:21:21:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics, including the amount outstanding and maturity. For a smaller subset of loans, we 
18:552:46696:21:20:72:542:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are also able to infer the interest rat e based on the loan’s original principal amount and payment 
18:553:46796:20:21:72:543:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:schedule. We infer the interest rate on each loan by computing an internal rate of return based on 
18:554:46895:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the initial principal amount and the schedule of promised loan repayments. The    borrower-level 
18:555:46992:21:20:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:panel includes the county where a borrower is located, a borrower’s proprietary credit score from 
18:556:47090:20:21:72:543:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:PayNet, and various proxies for   borrower size based on its total    borrowings in the PayNet database. 
18:557:47194:21:21:108:543:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Since    all of our regressions are run at the county-year level, the PayNet data is aggregated 
18:558:47290:21:20:72:548:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from   the loan-quarter or borrower-quarter level to the county-year level by taking equ al-weighted 
18:559:47391:20:21:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:averages. To ensure comparability with the CRA data, which defines small business loans as those 
18:560:47487:21:21:72:555:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:under $1 million  , we restrict attention to borrowers whose total outstanding loans in the PayNet 
18:561:47586:21:33:72:514:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:database (potentially across multiple loans) are less than $2 million at a given point in time. 
18:562:47682:33:20:108:278:220:144:Times:144:Times:A:B. Initial presence of Top 4 banks 
18:563:47716:20:21:108:543:200:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:A:Our main proxy for the initial presence of Top 4 banks in a given county is the Top  4  
18:564:47804:21:21:72:543:179:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:Deposit  Share or T4DSc. T4DSc is defined as the fraction of county c’s total 2005 deposits that 
18:565:47901:21:20:72:543:158:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were held at depository institutions owned by Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells 
18:566:47995:20:21:72:542:138:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Fargo—i.e., we always aggregate bank-level data to the bank holding company level. T4DSc is 
18:567:48087:21:21:72:543:117:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:constructed by aggregating branch-level data on deposits from the FDIC’s Summary of Deposits 
18:568:48180:21:0:72:542:96:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(SOD) database to the county level. To ensure that our findings are driven by real changes in bank 
19:569:48282:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:behavior as opposed to changes in the ownership structure of banks, we adjust both our CRA and 
19:570:48377:20:21:72:192:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:SOD data for mergers.15 
19:571:48400:21:21:108:565:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Because the CRA database contains  bank   -county level observations on small business loan 
19:572:48492:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:originations, we   can also    measure the Top 4’s initial presence in a county using their share of 2005 
19:573:48598:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:originations as opposed to their share of deposits. Naturally, the Top 4 loan and deposit shares are 
19:574:48699:21:21:72:557:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:highly correlated across counties—the correlation is 0.75—and we obtain similar results if we   use 
19:575:48799:21:20:72:273:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this alternative proxy for Top 4 presence. 
19:576:48842:20:21:108:542:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Nonetheless,  the  Top  4  deposit  share is  our  preferred  measure for  two  reasons. First, 
19:577:48938:21:21:72:558:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:because the   FDIC’s deposit data   covers all depository institutions but   the CRA loan data only 
19:578:49038:21:21:72:547:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:covers those with assets over $1 billion, our deposit-based measure accounts  for the market share 
19:579:49137:21:20:72:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of small community banks with assets less than $1 billion—a set of banks known to play an 
19:580:49227:20:21:72:558:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:important role in small business lending (Berger and Udell [2006]). Second, the loan share vari  able 
19:581:49329:21:21:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may    contain considerable transitory noise which would lead to measurement error in our key right-
19:582:49429:21:20:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hand side variable. Indeed, the deposit share is more persistent than the loan share, both within 
19:583:49527:20:33:72:222:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties and across counties.16 
19:584:49558:33:21:108:303:386:144:Times:144:Times:A:C. County-level labor market outcomes 
19:585:49595:21:20:108:543:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We use four measures of county-level labor market activity: the establishment expansion 
19:586:49683:20:21:71:542:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rate,  the  unemployment  rate,  total  employment, and  wages.  We  obtain  county-level  data  on 
19:587:49783:21:21:71:543:324:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:establishment expansion rates—the fraction of business establishments that expand employment 
19:588:49876:21:20:71:543:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in a given year—from the Census’s Bureau’s Statistics on U.S. Businesses (SUSB) database.17 
19:589:49967:20:37:72:543:283:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Second, we obtain annual data on county-level unemployment rates and the size of a county’s 
19:590:50059:37:19:72:219:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
19:591:50108:19:15:72:544:227:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:15 W e consider any depository institution that was acquired by one of the Top 4 banking firms between 2005 and 2014 
19:592:50225:15:11:72:542:212:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:to be a Top 4 bank in 2005. Thus,    the wave of acquisitions that occurred during the 2008 peak of the financial crisis 
19:593:50346:11:12:72:542:201:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:contributes to the Top 4 share. For example, both Wachovia’s and Washington Mutual’s 2005 deposits contribute to 
19:594:50459:12:11:72:544:189:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:F:T4DS because the former was acquired by Wells Fargo and the latter was acquired by JPMorgan.  The implicit 
19:595:50565:11:12:72:542:178:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:assumption here is that these acquired banks were impacted by an organization-wide decision to pull back from small 
19:596:50681:12:10:71:187:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:business lending after 2008. 
19:597:50709:10:15:72:542:156:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:16 When we instead use the Top 4 loan share, our reduced-form results are slightly weaker, consistent with the view 
19:598:50825:15:11:71:542:141:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:that the loan share is a noisier measure of a county’s exposure to the Top 4 than the deposit share. However, we obtain 
19:599:50945:11:12:71:542:130:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:statistically strong and economically larger results if we use the deposit share as an instrument for the loan share. This 
19:600:51068:12:11:71:542:118:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:approach is the natural solution to eliminating the attenuation bias resulting from the fact that the loan share is 
19:601:51184:11:10:71:157:107:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:measured with error. 
19:602:51204:10:15:72:542:97:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:17 The SUSB is carried out on March 12th each year. We call the expansion rate from March 12, YYYY to March 12, 
19:603:51316:15:0:72:527:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:YYYY+1 the “year-YYYY expansion rate.” The SUSB data is currently only available through 2012–2013.

20:606:51619:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:each county. Third, we obtain annual data on county-level total private employment and wages 
20:607:51712:21:20:72:540:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from the BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) database. Our annual county-
20:608:51801:20:21:71:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level QCEW data on private employment reflect the annual average of four quarterly QCEW 
20:609:51889:21:21:71:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:surveys for each county. Our wage variable is the annual average pay per employee, which the 
20:610:51982:21:33:71:540:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Census computes by dividing total annual wages by annual average employment in each county.  
20:611:52075:33:20:107:283:551:144:Times:144:Times:A:D. Additional county-level controls 
20:612:52110:20:21:107:542:531:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Our difference-in-difference specifications control for a number of additional county-level 
20:613:52202:21:21:71:542:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:variables. First,  we  use  the  QCEW  data  to  compute  the  distribution  of  2005  county-level 
20:614:52302:21:20:71:543:489:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment across nine    broad industries.  We include these county-level   employment shares as 
20:615:52400:20:21:71:543:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:controls to ensure that our results are not driven by the possibility that counties with a high 
20:616:52496:21:21:71:542:448:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:exposure  to  the  Top  4  banks  had  different  exposures  to  common  industry  shocks  than  other 
20:617:52599:21:20:71:117:427:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties. 
20:618:52609:20:21:107:547:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Second, to control for potential differences in local fundamentals  linked to demographics, 
20:619:52701:21:21:72:542:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:we obtain 2005 county-level demographic information from the American Community Survey 
20:620:52788:21:20:72:542:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(ACS), including the fraction of the population that is college-educated, the homeownership rate,

20:630:53605:21:20:107:543:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We now examine the economic consequences of the   shock to the supply of small business 
20:631:53693:20:21:71:542:145:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loans from   the Top 4 banks. Our   basic empirical strategy is a difference-in-difference approach 
20:632:53793:21:21:71:542:124:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that compares economic outcomes in counties with a high Top 4 share to those in otherwise similar

21:635:54098:20:21:72:596:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:understand how affected counties have adjusted over time, we then   trace    out   the dynamic impact 
21:636:54200:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:over    our full 2006 to 2014 sample. Next, we   present three    separate triple-difference specifications

21:638:54410:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impacted local labor markets. Finally, we use our data from PayNet to better understand how local 
21:639:54508:21:33:72:310:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit markets have adjusted to the supply shock.

21:642:54694:20:21:108:561:531:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We begin with our first stage results, which show that   , compared to otherwise similar 
21:643:54783:21:21:72:563:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties, counties with a high initial Top 4 share experienced larger reductions in total    small

21:645:54980:20:22:72:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:binned scatterplot. Specifically, the   figure plots the percentage point change in loan originations

21:652:55553:20:21:72:543:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regressions weighting each county by its 2005 population. We use population weights because 
21:653:55645:21:21:72:543:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:households and firms, not counties, are the natural units of economic interest. (However, we obtain 
21:654:55745:21:20:72:543:273:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:similar point estimates with similar levels of significance if we instead weight all counties equally.)

21:662:56495:16:11:71:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:The solid line is the corresponding OLS coefficient estimate. Both %∆Loansc and T4DSc are residualized using a set 
21:663:56610:11:0:71:515:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:controls listed in Figure 3, so the figure corresponds to the multivariate specification in column (5) of Table 3.

22:665:56825:20:21:72:539:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with a 0.27 (=  21.7 × 0.23 ÷ 18.4) standard deviation decline in county-level loan growth. The t-
22:666:56923:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:statistic on T4DSc is t = 3.84 in column (1) and the corresponding F-statistic is F = 14.75, exceeding 
22:667:57026:21:20:71:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the threshold of 10 below which Stock, Wright, and Yogo (2002) argue that weak instruments 
22:668:57117:20:21:71:164:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:become a concern. 
22:669:57135:21:21:107:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The    next two columns of Table 3 add controls for other 2005 county-level observables. 
22:670:57224:21:20:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Specifically, column (2) adds our set of baseline controls: each county’s 2005 population, average 
22:671:57323:20:21:71:542:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:annual wages, labor force-to-population ratio , and unemployment rate as well as each county’s 
22:672:57418:21:21:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:industry mix (the fraction of 2005 county employment in nine    broad industry groups). The addition 
22:673:57519:21:21:71:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of these controls has little effect on the coefficient of interest. Next, column (3) adds a set of 
22:674:57618:21:20:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:controls from the 2005 American Community Survey (ACS): the fraction of college graduates, the 
22:675:57713:20:21:71:542:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fraction of home owners, the fraction of population aged 25 and over, and the fraction of population 
22:676:57814:21:21:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:aged   65 and over. S ince    ACS data is only available for larger counties with    populations exceeding

22:678:58020:20:21:72:542:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this is because our   regressions weight counties by  2005 population. As result, the small counties 
22:679:58121:21:21:72:543:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that are dropped in column (3) receive little weight in columns (1) and (2).  Column (4) adds 
22:680:58215:21:21:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:controls for prior changes in county-level economic outcomes from 2002 to 2006, labeled wage

22:682:58406:21:21:72:233:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact on the T4DSc coefficient.  
22:683:58439:21:21:108:542:314:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, Table 3 shows that there is a strong and robust negative relationship between the

22:686:58733:20:21:72:542:252:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in untabulated regressions, we verify that these  results are robust to excluding a set of states such 
22:687:58836:21:21:72:543:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as California, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida that were particularly hard hit by the Great Recession.

22:690:58985:19:15:72:542:132:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:19 O ur baseline measure of county-level loan originations includes all small business loans with initial balances less 
22:691:59105:15:11:71:542:117:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:than $1 million. The CRA database also contains data on loan originations to very small firms with annual revenues 
22:692:59220:11:13:71:545:106:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:less than $1 million. We obtain nearly identical results using this narrower measure. For example,  if we use this 
22:693:59335:13:11:71:554:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:narrower measure, the coefficient on T4DSc in the specification corresponding to column (5) of Table 3 is β1 = –16.9

23:698:59748:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:by examining the impact on the expansion rate of business establishments,  which is arguably our 
23:699:59845:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:best measure of small business activity in a county because it counts all establishments equally. 
23:700:59943:21:21:72:546:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Indeed, small business owners report that a lack of access to credit primarily leads them to  scale 
23:701:60043:21:20:72:500:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:back the rate at which they are expanding their businesses (Mills and McCarthy [2014]). 
23:702:60131:20:21:108:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The impact of the Top 4 credit supply shock on establishment expansion rates is shown in

23:704:60322:21:21:72:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a county’s expansion rate from 2006 to 2010 and the county’s Top 4 Deposit Share in 2005. The

23:706:60517:20:28:72:369:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimate county-level cross-sectional regressions of the form:

23:709:60720:22:20:72:542:409:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2010. The coefficient on T4DSc of  –1.59 in column (3) implies that a county with a 100% Top 4 
23:710:60815:20:21:72:543:389:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:share saw a 1.59 percentage point decline in the establishment expansion rate relative to a county 
23:711:60914:21:21:72:543:368:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with no Top 4 presence. Put   differently, a one standard deviation increase in T4DSc is associated 
23:712:61014:21:20:72:483:347:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with  a 0.158 (= 1.59 × 0.230 ÷ 2.31) standard deviation decline in the expansion rate. 
23:713:61102:20:21:107:560:327:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Relative to column (1), columns (2)  through (4) add the same batteries of controls that    we 
23:714:61197:21:21:72:542:306:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:introduced  in  Table  3. Column  (5)  in  Table  4  adds  the  lagged  outcome  variable—the  2005

23:716:61395:20:21:72:543:265:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:robustness check in a difference-in-difference design. If the outcome variable is mean-reverting 
23:717:61492:21:21:72:543:244:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and the treated and untreated counties differ in their average initial level of the outcome variable, 
23:718:61594:21:21:72:543:223:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one might mistake mean reversion for a treatment effect (Ashenfelter [1978]). Hence, the parallel 
23:719:61692:21:20:72:543:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trends assumption is more credible when controlling for the lagged outcome, as we do in column 
23:720:61787:20:21:72:542:182:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(5).   In summary, the estimates from columns (2) through (5) show that   introducing a large battery 
23:721:61889:21:21:71:341:161:144:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f2:B:of  controls has little effect on the coefficient of interest. 
23:722:61951:21:20:108:563:140:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Panel B of Table 4 presents the    corresponding instrumental-variables (IV)    estimates. We 
23:723:62045:20:25:71:306:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimate cross-sectional regressions of the form:

24:726:62249:22:21:72:542:686:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:simply the ratio of the coefficients on T4DSc from    the reduced form in Panel A and first stage in 
24:727:62350:21:21:72:545:665:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Table 3—i.e., 훽훽퐼퐼퐼퐼=훽훽2/훽훽1.  Focusing on column (3), our IV estimates suggest that a credit supply 
24:728:62451:21:22:72:546:644:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shock  that  leads  to  a  one-standard  deviation decline in  %∆Loansc leads  to  a  0.610

24:730:62643:21:21:71:496:601:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that credit supply shocks can have a meaningful impact on local small business activity. 
24:731:62731:21:21:107:542:580:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The key identifying assumption underpinning our difference-in-difference estimates is that 
24:732:62822:21:21:71:542:559:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:high and low Top 4 bank counties would have followed parallel trends in the absence of the credit 
24:733:62920:21:20:71:566:538:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supply shock from the Top 4 banks. To assess the plausibility this  assumption, Figure 4 plots    the 
24:734:63022:20:21:71:542:518:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time  -series dynamics  of annual loan originations and establishment expansion rates in high and 
24:735:63120:21:21:71:542:497:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:low Top 4 counties. Figure 4 shows that loan originations and expansion rates in high and low Top 
24:736:63218:21:20:71:542:476:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:4 counties followed roughly paral  lel  paths from 1999 through 2007. However, beginning in 2008, 
24:737:63316:20:21:71:542:456:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:establishment expansion rates in high Top 4 counties fall significantly relative to those in low Top 
24:738:63417:21:21:71:482:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:4 counties—just as loan originations in high and low Top 4 counties diverge sharply. 
24:739:63502:21:20:107:542:414:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Although the Top 4 banks were growing their   small business lending more rapidly than 
24:740:63589:20:21:71:542:394:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other banks before 2008, Figure 4 shows that the growth in total    small business lending by all 
24:741:63687:21:21:71:543:373:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks was similar in high and low Top 4 counties prior to the crisis. This is because the Top 4 
24:742:63783:21:21:71:543:352:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks were    rapidly gaining market share at the expense of other banks in these areas. Thus, judged 
24:743:63885:21:20:71:542:331:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:relative to low Top 4 counties, it does not appear that aggregate small business lending conditions 
24:744:63985:20:21:71:542:311:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were    overheated in high Top 4 counties before the crisis. To be sure, this fact does not allow us to 
24:745:64089:21:21:71:543:290:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:conclude that the pre-crisis level of small business lending by the Top 4 was not excessive in some 
24:746:64189:21:20:71:556:269:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:way  ; for example, it may have been excessive relative to their own underwriting capabilities in 
24:747:64287:20:21:71:543:249:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this  segment.     However,  the  evidence does  cut  against  the  view  that  high  Top  4  counties 
24:748:64390:21:21:71:543:228:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:experienced  worse  credit  and  labor  market outcomes beginning  in  2008  simply  because the 
24:749:64487:21:20:71:543:207:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate quantity of   small business credit had been particularly over-extended in those areas and 
24:750:64588:20:21:71:379:187:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:they were therefore experiencing a larger post-crisis correction. 
24:751:64653:21:22:107:542:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Table 5 presents analogous results for three other county-level labor market outcomes: 
24:752:64740:22:22:71:543:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f2:B:∆URc, the change in the county-level unemployment rate from 2006 to 2010; ∆Empc – ∆Popc, the 
24:753:64833:22:0:72:542:122:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006–2010 employment growth rate minus the 2006–2010 population growth rate; and ∆Wc, the 
25:754:64926:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentage change in county-level average annual wages from 2006 to 2010. Panel A of Table 5 
25:755:65018:20:22:72:434:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:presents the reduced form estimates and Panel B presents the IV estimates. 
25:756:65092:22:21:108:542:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The    impa   ct on   the unemployment rate   (∆URc)  is shown in columns (1) through (3) of Table 
25:757:65191:21:21:72:557:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:5. The reduced form coefficient on T4DSc of  2.4  in column (2) of Panel A means that a county 
25:758:65286:21:20:72:543:624:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with  a  100%  Top  4  Deposit  Share  saw  an  additional  2.4 percentage  point  increase  in 
25:759:65382:20:21:72:543:604:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment relative to a county in which the Top 4 had zero presence. This    implies that a one 
25:760:65481:21:21:72:543:583:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:standard deviation increase in T4DSc leads to a 0.29   (= 2.4 × 0.23 ÷ 1.9) standard deviation increase 
25:761:65585:21:21:71:200:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in the unemployment rate. 
25:762:65611:21:22:107:543:541:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The impact on relative employment growth (∆Empc  – ∆Popc) is shown in columns (4) 
25:763:65693:22:20:72:543:519:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through (6). The estimate of –5.52 in column (5) of panel A implies that that a county with a 100%

25:765:65888:21:22:72:364:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:compared to a county in which the Top 4 had zero presence. 
25:766:65947:22:21:108:547:456:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the    results for 2006 to 2010 wage growth (∆Wc)  are presented in columns (7) 
25:767:66036:21:20:71:543:435:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through (9). T he reduced-form estimate of –2.06 in column (8) of Panel A means that a county 
25:768:66130:20:21:71:546:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with a 100% Top 4 Deposit Share experienced an additional 2 p.p.  decline in average annual pay 
25:769:66226:21:27:71:353:394:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:per employee relative to a county with no Top 4 presence.

25:771:66311:20:21:107:542:347:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Looking across counties, the results in Tables 4 and 5 suggest that the shock to the supply 
25:772:66403:21:21:71:543:326:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of small business credit from the Top 4 banks had a significant initial impact on local labor markets 
25:773:66505:21:21:71:545:305:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from 2006 to 2010. Did this credit supply shock from Top 4 banks have a meaningful effect on  the 
25:774:66603:21:20:71:548:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:national unemployment rate from 2006 to 2010? While we cannot account for any  potential general 
25:775:66700:20:21:71:562:264:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium effects stemming from the Top 4 bank credit supply contraction, we can offer    a rough 
25:776:66800:21:21:71:543:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:back -of-the-envelope calculation  based  on  our  cross-sectional  micro-estimates. Since  the 
25:777:66896:21:20:71:556:222:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population-weighted average level of T4DS is 30%, our   reduced-form   estimates from column (3) 
25:778:66993:20:22:71:542:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of Table 5 Panel A suggest that exposure to the Top 4 banks directly contributed 0.3 p.p. (= 30% 
25:779:67090:22:21:72:543:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:× 0.93 p.p.) to the rise in the national unemployment rate between 2006 to 2010. Because the 
25:780:67183:21:0:72:543:159:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment rate rose by 5.1 p.p. over this period, this suggests that the Top 4 credit supply 
26:781:67282:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shock accounts for roughly 5% of the total increase.20 Obviously, this calculation should be taken 
26:782:67381:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with a healthy grain of salt. However, it suggests that the Top 4 credit supply shock may have had 
26:783:67480:21:21:72:240:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:non-trivial aggregate implications. 
26:784:67515:21:20:108:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Going further, if one believes that part of the broader decline in the quantity of small 
26:785:67604:20:21:72:554:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business lending reflects  a generalized contraction in bank   loan supply, then an extrapolation of 
26:786:67705:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our difference-in-difference results suggests that the resulting small business credit gap may have 
26:787:67805:21:20:72:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contributed significantly to  the  severity  of  the  Great  Recession  and  the  sluggish  pace  of  the 
26:788:67911:20:21:72:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:recovery. For instance, suppose that one believes that one-   third  of the overall 42 p.p. decline in 
26:789:68014:21:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small business lending from 2006 to 2010 was  driven by a contraction in credit supply. Then our 
26:790:68111:21:21:72:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:IV estimates from column (3) of Table 5 Panel B would suggest that the resulting small business 
26:791:68207:21:20:72:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit  gap could  explain  14%  (=  1/3  ×  –0.0525 ×  –42  ÷  5.1)  of  the  rise  in  the  national 
26:792:68310:20:33:72:236:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment over this period.21 
26:793:68342:33:21:108:521:448:144:Times:144:Times:A:B. Dynamics: How local economic activity adjusted to the Top 4 credit supply shock 
26:794:68424:21:20:108:542:427:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we explore the dynamic impact on   local    credit and labor market activity following 
26:795:68517:20:21:72:565:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the initial shock to Top 4 loan supply in 2008. What    adjustment process might one expect to see if 
26:796:68619:21:21:72:543:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Top 4 banks pulled back from small business lending and never really returned? Initially, the 
26:797:68717:21:20:72:543:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:negative supply shock should lead to a small business credit crunch with attendant negative effects 
26:798:68817:20:21:72:540:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on local employment, just as we saw in the prior section. Over time, however, other lenders—
26:799:68909:21:21:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:either small banks or non-bank lenders—should be drawn into the market by the promise of greater 
26:800:69006:21:20:72:543:303:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:returns, leading to a more normalized flow of credit in affected counties. However, to the extent 
26:801:69104:20:21:72:546:283:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that    these new lenders were  higher cost providers of credit than the Top 4 banks, the n the supply 
26:802:69207:21:21:72:543:262:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:shock might have a long-lasting impact on the cost of credit. Turning to the labor market, as the 
26:803:69305:21:21:72:559:241:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:acute credit shortage eases and real    wages slowly adjust downwards, one would expect the   adverse 
26:804:69407:21:23:72:562:220:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effects on employment to dissipate. However, if the    cost of small business credit remains elevated 
26:805:69509:23:18:72:219:197:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
26:806:69558:18:15:72:542:179:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:20 Based on Table 1, on a population-weighted basis, the unemployment rose by 5.1 p.p. in the average county. This 
26:807:69673:15:12:71:542:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:closely tracks the rise in the national unemployment rate of 4.9 p.p. from 4.4% in December 2006 to 9.3% in December 
26:808:69790:12:10:71:116:152:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2010.     
26:809:69800:10:15:72:542:142:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:21 If we instead use the   somewhat larger estimates in column (2), we would calculate that exposure to the Top 4 banks 
26:810:69920:15:11:72:542:127:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:directly contributed 0.7 p.p. (= 30% × 2.4 p.p.) to the rise in the national unemployment rate or roughly 14% of the 
26:811:70037:11:12:72:542:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:total increase between 2006 and 2010. And our extrapolation based on our IV estimates would suggest that a broader 
26:812:70152:12:0:72:507:104:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:small business credit gap could explain 37% (= 1/3 × – 0.134 × –42 ÷ 5.1) of the total rise in unemployment. 
27:813:70263:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in affected areas, small businesses in these areas might become less capital intensive, leading to

27:822:70761:25:22:72:542:550:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Because equation (6) includes both county and year fixed effects, each of the βτ coefficients is 
27:823:70858:22:21:72:543:528:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:analogous to a separate difference-in-difference estimate. Specifically, the coefficient βτ reflects 
27:824:70957:21:22:72:543:507:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the   difference between high and low T4DS counties in  the cumulative  change in the outcome

27:826:71151:21:20:72:542:464:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient on T4DS in Tables 3 to 5.23 Figure 5 plots these coefficients over time, effectively

27:832:71663:22:21:72:543:338:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percentage point decline in small business lending associated with the Top 4 supply shock. The 
27:833:71758:21:21:72:543:317:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:first graph in Figure 5, which plots the annual βτ coefficients from   column (1) of Table 6, shows 
27:834:71858:21:21:72:543:296:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that counties with a high initial Top 4 presence experienced a prolonged small business credit 
27:835:71953:21:21:72:543:275:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:crunch starting in 2008 and peaking in 2010. The plot also    shows that the annual flow of small 
27:836:72051:21:33:71:543:254:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business credit to affected counties begins to turn around after 2010 and had largely returned to

27:838:72198:19:15:72:542:202:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:22 Of course, in the very long-run, one would expect some combination of differential lender entry and labor mobility 
27:839:72316:15:11:71:541:187:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:across regions to gradually eliminate any wage differentials due to initial geographical differences in cost of credit. 
27:840:72436:11:12:71:542:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:However, it seems natural to think that this long-run convergence process may take many years (see, e.g., Ganong and 
27:841:72553:12:10:71:134:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Shoag [2016]). 
27:842:72567:10:15:72:543:154:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f2:F:23 These coefficients are not exactly  the same for two reasons. First, Table 6 uses dynamic lagged values of the control 
27:843:72689:15:11:72:542:139:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:variables as opposed to the 2005 controls used in Tables 3 to 5. Second, the controls are assumed to have the same 
27:844:72804:11:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:effect  each  year  in  Table  6.  Because they  absorb additional  variation, the   dynamic  controls  in  Table  6 lead  to 
27:845:72930:12:11:72:549:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:coefficients  that  are  similar  but  more  precisely  estimated  than  those  in  Tables  3  to 5.   We  have  also  estimated 
27:846:73059:11:12:72:562:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:specifications that perfectly parallel those in Table 3—i.e., we use the same 2005     controls and interact these with a set 
27:847:73185:12:11:72:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of year dummies. This yields qualitatively similar results to those shown in Table 6, albeit with slightly diminished 
27:848:73303:11:0:72:257:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:statistical significance in some specifications. 
28:849:73354:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trend by 2014. As we will see below, the total annual flow of bank   credit recovers because other 
28:850:73453:20:21:72:542:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks have gradually stepped in to fill the gap left by the Top 4. Nonetheless, since the annual 
28:851:73550:21:21:71:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:flow    has only normalized in 2014, Figure 5 suggests that the Top 4 credit supply shock may have 
28:852:73649:21:20:71:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:had a more permanent impact on the total stock of small business credit and physical capital in 
28:853:73744:20:21:71:159:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:affected counties. 
28:854:73762:21:22:107:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (3) and (4) of Table 6  show an analogous set of specifications using Expansionsct 
28:855:73852:22:21:72:543:583:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as the dependent variable. Here, our county-year panel runs from 2006 to 2012. Again, the βτ 
28:856:73944:21:21:72:542:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients reflect differences in the cumulative change in the establishment expansion rate from 
28:857:74043:21:22:71:555:541:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006 to year τ between high and low T4DS counties. The    estimates in c  olumn (3) of Table 6 are 
28:858:74142:22:20:71:543:519:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:plotted in the second graph of Figure 5. The plot shows that differences in small business activity 
28:859:74242:20:21:71:543:499:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:between high and low Top 4 counties emerge only   in 2008, just when the Top 4 banks significantly 
28:860:74341:21:21:71:542:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cut their small business lending. Furthermore, these estimates suggest that the real effects of this 
28:861:74442:21:20:71:542:457:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit supply shock are not confined to the depths of the financial crisis: Top 4 counties have lower 
28:862:74544:20:21:71:543:437:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business expansion rates even as late as 2011. Thus, our  evidence  sheds  light  on the  factors 
28:863:74642:21:21:71:542:416:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:affecting the slow recovery from the 2007–2009 financial crisis and recession, distinguishing our 
28:864:74739:21:20:71:539:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:work    from the literature that focuses primarily on the depths of the financial crisis (e.g., Chodorow-

28:866:74928:21:21:107:542:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (5) and (6) of Table 6 present a parallel set of specifications for the county-level 
28:867:75021:21:21:71:542:333:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment  rate.  C olumns  (7)  and  (8) repeat  the  exercise  for  the  cumulative  growth  in 
28:868:75122:21:20:71:543:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment relative to population growth. The coefficients from column (5) are shown in the third 
28:869:75220:20:21:71:542:292:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:graph of  Figure 5. Again, the estimates show that the differences in unemployment and relative 
28:870:75316:21:21:71:542:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment growth between high and low Top 4 counties only begin to emerge in 2008 when the 
28:871:75408:21:20:71:542:250:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Top 4 banks cut their small business lending. The effect on unemployment peaks in 2010 and then 
28:872:75504:20:21:71:275:230:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dissipates slowly, vanishing only in 2013. 
28:873:75547:21:21:108:542:209:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, columns (9) and (10)    show the results for county-level   wages. Specifically, the 
28:874:75641:21:21:72:542:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dependent variable is  average annual wages in county c in year t scaled by the corresponding level 
28:875:75741:21:20:72:542:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in  2006—i.e., 푌푌푏푏푐푐=100× (푊푊퐿퐿푊푊푊푊퐿퐿푏푏푐푐/ 푊푊퐿퐿푊푊푊푊퐿퐿푏푏2006).  The    fourth graph  in  Figure 5  plots  the 
28:876:75850:20:21:72:543:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients from column (9).  Again, the   wage effects  only emerge in 2008. Interestingly, however, 
28:877:75953:21:21:72:543:126:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the   impact on wages does not appear to dissipate over time. Instead, the estimates suggest that, 
28:878:76052:21:21:71:556:105:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:even as late at 2014, cumulative wage growth in counties with T4DS = 100% was   approximately 
28:879:76146:21:0:71:349:84:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:4 percentage points lower than in those with T4DS = 0%. 
29:880:76205:0:20:108:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The   natural interpretation of th  is set of findings is that real wages can only decline slowly 
29:881:76303:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:due to nominal rigidities , leading to a temporary rise in unemployment following a negative shock. 
29:882:76403:21:21:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Once  real wages have fully    adjusted, employment returns to its long-run natural level. However,

29:885:76715:21:33:71:319:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:product of labor and, hence, on equilibrium wages.

29:887:76792:20:21:107:543:552:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In  this subsection,  we  assess  the  extent  to  which  a  county’s  initial  Top  4  exposure 
29:888:76889:21:21:71:542:531:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:influenced county-level employment through a narrow small business credit supply channel or 
29:889:76981:21:21:71:542:510:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through a broader credit supply channel. As   we noted above, while the Top 4 banks’ cutback in 
29:890:77077:21:20:72:557:489:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small business credit was especially pronounced, their   loan growth has been stagnant in many 
29:891:77172:20:21:71:542:469:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:categories since 2007. Thus, in addition to cutbacks in small business credit, a county’s exposure 
29:892:77271:21:21:71:543:448:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to  the Top  4  banks  may  have affected  local  labor  markets because it  reduced  the  supply  of 
29:893:77373:21:20:72:543:427:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:household credit, thereby   crimping local consumer demand.24 Although we cannot rule out the 
29:894:77467:20:21:72:542:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:existence of  this broader credit channel, we present three triple-difference specifications which 
29:895:77566:21:21:72:543:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:collectively suggest that a narrower small business credit channel plays an important role in driving 
29:896:77668:21:26:72:179:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our baseline findings.

29:898:77777:21:21:108:543:318:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:A first distinguishing prediction of the small business channel is that initial Top 4 exposure 
29:899:77871:21:20:72:558:297:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:should have the   largest impact on total employment in counties where small businesses account 
29:900:77967:20:21:71:543:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for a large fraction of initial employment. To test this hypothesis, we estimate cross-sectional

29:906:78443:12:11:71:542:127:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:counties. Indeed, in untabulated results, we find that HMDA mortgage originations decline in high Top 4 counties 
29:907:78556:11:12:71:541:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:relative to those in low Top 4 counties. Relatedly, D’Acunto and Rossi (2017) find that large banks reduced their

30:914:79263:21:21:72:315:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:smaller declines in employment in those counties. 
30:915:79313:21:20:108:548:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Table 7 presents the results from this exercise. Consider the estimates in column (3): w hen 
30:916:79406:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:SmallSharec = 0%, the difference in relative employment growth between counties with T4DSc =

30:918:79595:21:21:71:542:522:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:T4DS  appears  to  have  a small positive,  but   statistically  insignificant effect  on employment. 
30:919:79697:21:21:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, when SmallSharec = 100%, the estimated difference in employment growth between 
30:920:79785:21:21:72:543:480:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties with T4DSc = 100% and 0% is −17.3 p.p. Thus, the triple-difference is 휏휏=−27.3 p.p. 
30:921:79878:21:20:71:542:459:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:These findings suggest that    the Top 4 credit supply shock is pr   imarily working through a narrow

30:924:80082:21:21:107:562:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The small business credit supply channel also    predicts that industries that are most reliant 
30:925:80178:21:20:71:542:370:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on external finance should be more adversely affected by the Top 4 credit supply shock. Thus, we 
30:926:80275:20:21:71:554:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:next  use data  at  the  county-industry  level  and   adopt  the  identification  strategy  of  Rajan  and

30:928:80483:21:20:72:543:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:industries  with  minimal  external  financing  needs  serve  as  the  placebo  group.  Thus,  our

31:939:81217:20:21:72:543:666:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:expanding firms in industry i required above-median use of external financial capital, according 
31:940:81314:21:21:72:543:645:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to the Census Bureau’s 2007 Survey of Business Owners.26 Industries are defined at the 2-digit

31:942:81500:20:21:71:542:604:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:establishments or  employment  level  in  that  cell from  the 2005 cross  -section. Equation  (8a) 
31:943:81600:21:21:72:543:583:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:includes a full set of industry fixed effects and equation (8b) includes both industry and county 
31:944:81698:21:20:72:542:562:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fixed effects. Thus, equation (8b) exploits only within-county variation, avoiding any potential 
31:945:81795:20:21:72:543:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:concerns arising due to unobservable cross-county differences in local demand or other local

31:949:82088:22:21:72:543:457:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on establishment expansion rates in industries with below-median reliance on external finance. 
31:950:82183:21:21:72:542:436:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, we find β2 = –3.82 p.p., suggesting that  , in industries with above-median reliance on 
31:951:82280:21:21:72:543:415:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:external  finance,  there  are  large  differences  in  expansion  rates between  high  and  low  Top  4 
31:952:82385:21:22:72:543:394:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties. Column (4) shows the estimate of equation (8b), which includes both industry and county 
31:953:82483:22:21:72:483:372:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effects. We find β2 =  –3.51 p.p., nearly identical to our estimates of β2 in column (3). 
31:954:82573:21:21:107:543:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:It is also useful to compare the point estimates from Table 4 with those in Panel A of Table 
31:955:82666:21:20:71:542:330:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:8. Table 8 shows that there is a sizable effect for high external finance industries, but there is 
31:956:82765:20:21:71:543:310:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:essentially zero effect for low external finance industries. Thus, the coefficients in Table 4, which 
31:957:82867:21:22:71:542:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reflect the effect on the average industry, are bracketed by the effect on low external finance 
31:958:82963:22:21:71:453:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:industries β1 ≈ 0 and the effect on high external finance industries β1 + β2 ≈ β2.

31:963:83416:21:22:72:543:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:all controls, we obtain β1 = –0.30 p.p. and β2 = –7.28 p.p. Column (4) shows the estimate of 
31:964:83509:22:25:72:556:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:equation (8b) which includes both industry and county fixed effects. We find β2 = –8.19 p.p. The

31:966:83657:19:15:72:542:97:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:26 We define external capital to include bank and government loans, loans from family or friends, credit cards, venture 
31:967:83777:15:0:72:496:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:capital investment or grants, and only consider employer firms in the Survey of Business Owners dataset. 
32:968:83884:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:results in  Panel B show that the divergence in employment outcomes between high and low Top

32:970:84089:21:27:72:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the real impact from the credit supply shock primarily operates through a small business channel. 
32:971:84187:27:20:108:509:640:144:Times:144:Times:A:C.3. Differential effects: Employment in tradable versus non-tradable industries 
32:972:84267:20:21:108:543:620:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Because small firms in tradable industries tend to be more reliant on external finance than 
32:973:84359:21:21:72:543:599:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small firms in non-tradable industries, the   small business credit supply channel also suggests that 
32:974:84461:21:20:72:542:578:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our employment results should be stronger in tradable industries. Specifically, according to the 
32:975:84558:20:21:72:542:558:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2007 Survey of Business Owners, 40% of expanding small businesses in tradable industries relied 
32:976:84654:21:21:72:554:537:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on some form of external financing; the corresponding figure for non-tradable industries was 31%.   
32:977:84754:21:21:72:394:516:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:This difference is both economically and statistically significant.27 
32:978:84823:21:20:108:543:495:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Table 9 presents results from triple-difference regressions that ask whether a county’s 
32:979:84911:20:21:71:543:475:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:initial  exposure  to  the Top    4  banks had   a  larger  impact  on employment  growth  in tradable 
32:980:85014:21:21:71:540:454:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:industries   than in non-tradable industries. Specifically, in Table 9, we define industries at the 4-
32:981:85116:21:20:71:542:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:digit  NAICS  level  and,  following  Mian  and  Sufi  (2014),  classify industries as tradable (e.g., 
32:982:85219:20:21:71:542:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing), non-tradable (e.g., restaurants and retail), or neither. Th e specifications in Table 
32:983:85321:21:21:71:542:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:9 take the same form in equations (8a) and (8b), but we   replace ExtFinUsei with Tradablei—a 
32:984:85415:21:20:72:540:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dummy variable equal to one for tradable industries—and restrict attention to tradable and non-
32:985:85510:20:21:71:542:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:trad  able industries. As in Panel B of Table 8, the   dependent variable in Table 9 is ΔYic = ΔEmpic – 
32:986:85613:21:21:72:117:330:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ΔPopc.28 
32:987:85621:21:20:108:543:309:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Across all   col umns in Table 9, the coefficient on the key   interaction term T4DSc × Tradablei 
32:988:85718:20:21:72:543:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is negative and significant, indicating that the Top 4 supply shock had a more negative impact on 
32:989:85816:21:21:72:543:268:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment in tradable industries than  in non-tradable industries. In this way, the results in Table 
32:990:85918:21:21:72:543:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:9 help to distinguish our findings from those in Mian and Sufi (2014), who argue that the large 
32:991:86014:21:29:72:542:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:drop  in  household  net  worth during  the  Great  Recession had  a  negative  effect  on  household 
32:992:86116:29:18:72:219:197:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
32:993:86165:18:15:72:542:179:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:27 We can also measure average external finance dependence using Compustat data from 1990 to 2006, restricting 
32:994:86276:15:12:71:541:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:attention to small, mature firms, following Cetorelli and Strahan (2006). For these small firms, we find that firms in 
32:995:86395:12:10:71:510:152:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:tradable industries are, on average, more dependent on external finance than firms in non-tradable industries. 
32:996:86505:10:15:72:542:142:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:28 Since almost all tradable industries are classified as being dependent on external finance in Table 8 (and vice-versa 
32:997:86626:15:11:72:542:127:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:for non-tradable industries), the only major differences between Table 8 Panel B and Table 9 is that the latter works 
32:998:86744:11:12:71:542:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:with industries at the 4-digit NAICS level (as opposed to the 2-digit level) and drops industries that are neither 
32:999:86859:12:0:71:325:104:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:classified as tradable or non-tradable by Mian and Sufi (2014). 
33:1000:86926:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand. Specifically, exploiting geographic variation across counties, they find that larger home 
33:1001:87024:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:price declines from 2007 to 2009 led to   larger declines in local employment in non-tradable 
33:1002:87117:21:21:72:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:industries, which are highly exposed to shifts in local consumption demand but had little impact 
33:1003:87214:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on local    employment in tradable industries, which are less exposed to local demand.29 By contrast, 
33:1004:87316:20:21:71:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:our findings in Table 9 suggest that the Top 4 small business credit supply shock had a bigger 
33:1005:87411:21:21:71:542:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact on local employment in tradable industries. Not only is this finding distinct from the

33:1009:87798:21:21:71:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:readily explained by a broader credit channel in which shocks to household credit plays a major 
33:1010:87894:21:20:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:role . Indeed, per the logic in Mian and Sufi (2014), a negative shock to the supply of household 
33:1011:87992:20:21:71:562:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit should have a larger impact on local employment in non -tradable industries, which are most

33:1014:88216:20:21:107:543:407:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we investigate how local  credit markets have adjusted to the supply shock from 
33:1015:88305:21:21:71:542:386:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Top 4 banks. First, we examine how the shock impacted the cost of credit in affected counties. 
33:1016:88404:21:20:71:543:365:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We then show how other lenders—both smaller banks and non-bank lenders—have gradually 
33:1017:88490:20:27:71:338:345:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:stepped in to fill the credit gap left by the Top 4 banks.

33:1019:88564:21:20:107:542:297:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In Table 10, we use data from PayNet to explore how the Top 4 shock has impacted the 
33:1020:88649:20:21:71:543:277:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pricing of  small business loans. As in Table 6, we construct a county-year panel that runs from 
33:1021:88746:21:32:71:330:256:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:2006 to 2014 and estimate specifications of the form:

33:1026:88915:19:17:72:542:156:64:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:29 Thus, in columns (2), (3) and (5) of Table 9, we control for both 2002 to 2006 home price growth and the interaction 
33:1027:89034:17:11:71:541:139:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:of prior home price growth and a dummy variable for tradable industries. We do so because counties with the largest 
33:1028:89150:11:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:home price appreciation from 2002 to 2006 subsequently experienced the largest decline in house prices from 2006 
33:1029:89263:12:11:71:549:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:to  2010 (Mian and Sufi [2016]). And, as Mian and Sufi (2014) show, these subsequent price declines impacted local 
33:1030:89378:11:12:71:542:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:consumption demand and employment in non-tradables due to the household net worth channel. Indeed, this same 
33:1031:89487:12:11:71:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:effect emerges in our county-industry panel. Nonetheless, introducing these controls has almost no impact on the 
33:1032:89600:11:0:71:209:82:100:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient on T4DSc × Tradablei.

34:1034:89737:20:21:72:374:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loans originated in county c and year t in  the PayNet database. 
34:1035:89801:21:21:108:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (1) to (2) of Table 10 show the   results whe  n the outcome variable is the loan 
34:1036:89891:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate measured in percentage points. For a subset of loans in the PayNet database, we can 
34:1037:89989:20:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:infer the loan rate. For each county-year cell, we then   compute the average rate on these newly 
34:1038:90087:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:originated loans. To isolate the impact of a supply shock holding fixed credit quality, we control 
34:1039:90186:21:20:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for the average PayNet borrower credit score in each county-year . The estimates in column (2) 
34:1040:90281:20:21:72:557:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:imply that, by 2012 and 2013, firms in counties with a T4DSc of 100% paid   interest rates that were 
34:1041:90382:21:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:roughly  1.1 percentage  points  higher  than  firms  in  counties  with  a T4DSc  of  0%.  This  an 
34:1042:90482:21:21:72:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:economically meaningful effect judged relative to the mean (13.5 p.p.) and standard deviation (5.3 
34:1043:90581:21:20:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:p.p.)    of  rates   . Columns (3) and    (4) show the analogous results when the dependent variable is the 
34:1044:90689:20:21:71:543:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loan   maturity measured in months.30 The coefficients in column (4) imply that firms in counties 
34:1045:90787:21:21:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with a T4DSc of 100% received loans with maturities that were 1.9 to 2.7 months shorter than firms 
34:1046:90886:21:20:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in counties with a T4DSc of 0%. This can be judged relative to a mean and standard deviation of 
34:1047:90981:20:21:72:319:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:loan maturity of 45.3 and 4.2 months, respectively. 
34:1048:91032:21:21:107:542:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Furthermore, t he   effects on interest rates and maturities in Table 10 have not dissipated 
34:1049:91125:21:20:71:540:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:over time, even though employment has gradually recovered in high T4DS counties. These longer-
34:1050:91219:20:21:72:542:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lasting effects on loan pricing are consistent with the view   that the smaller banks and non-bank 
34:1051:91318:21:21:71:557:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lenders who have stepped in to fill the gap are higher-cost credit providers than   the Top 4 banks 
34:1052:91418:21:20:71:543:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(Carroll and Hoffman [2013] and Mills and McCarthy [2016]).31 Thus, even though the annual 
34:1053:91509:20:21:72:542:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:flow of credit recovered, this persistent pricing difference suggests that a small business credit gap 
34:1054:91612:21:41:72:543:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may    have    still existed in  high Top 4 counties as late as 2014. In summary, the   results in Table 10 
34:1055:91719:41:19:72:219:233:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:

34:1057:91889:15:12:72:543:199:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:collapse the data to the   lender-county-year level by taking  equal   -weighted averages. To purge the loan maturity 
34:1058:92006:12:11:72:542:187:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:variable of any   variation due to different loan types across lenders in the database, we next run a panel regression of 
34:1059:92128:11:12:72:542:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:the lender-county-year average loan terms on lender fixed effects and retain the residuals. Finally, we average these 
34:1060:92246:12:11:71:539:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:residuals to create county-year average loan   maturities. The results are similar using unresidualized average county-
34:1061:92365:11:10:71:156:153:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:year loan maturities. 
34:1062:92386:10:15:72:542:143:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:31 According to Mills and McCarthy (2016), online lenders often charge interest rates of 25 percent or more. On the 
34:1063:92502:15:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:other hand, as of November 2014, the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicates that the 
34:1064:92612:12:11:71:541:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:weighted average interest rate on bank C&I loans under $1 million was below 4%. Furthermore, the STBL suggests 
34:1065:92723:11:12:71:542:105:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:that interest rates on small business loans at small banks are higher than those at large banks. Obviously, however, we 
34:1066:92843:12:11:71:542:93:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:cannot make definitive comparisons using the STBL data because we are unable to control for differences in borrowers 
34:1067:92960:11:0:71:148:82:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:across bank types. 
35:1068:92981:0:20:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggest  that  small  businesses  in affected  counties paid  a  higher  price  to  obtain  credit.  In 
35:1069:93085:20:21:71:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:combination with our   prior    findings that    the quantity of credit fell  , this    strongly suggests that high 
35:1070:93201:21:21:71:391:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Top 4 counties experienced a relative contraction in credit supply. 
35:1071:93269:21:20:108:542:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Combining the estimates in Table 10   with the specifications in Table 2, we can obtain an

35:1073:93461:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Here   , the structural equation of interest is %Δ 퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿퐿푏푏=훼훼+훽훽×Δ푟푟푏푏+휸휸′퐱퐱푏푏+휀휀푏푏. We estimate 
35:1074:93563:21:21:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this equation using two -stage least squares on the cross-section of differences from 2006 to 2010,

35:1077:93876:21:20:72:543:521:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Estimating this    semi   -elasticity provides another sanity check on the analysis: we want to know 
35:1078:93976:20:21:72:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whether  a  plausible  semi-elasticity  of  demand  can  be  used  to  reconcile  our  findings on  loan 
35:1079:94081:21:21:72:257:480:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:quantities with our findings on prices.

35:1082:94318:21:21:71:542:417:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cost of credit leads to a 20 p.p. decline in demand. The estimates are imprecise, which is hardly 
35:1083:94416:21:21:71:543:396:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:surprising given    the large number of other changes in credit markets  over this time period as well 
35:1084:94519:21:21:71:543:375:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as the coarseness of the data  . However, the magnitude of the estimated semi-elasticity of demand 
35:1085:94618:21:20:71:543:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:seems reasonable, suggesting that the decline in lending volumes we observe can plausibly be tied 
35:1086:94716:20:27:71:218:334:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to the increased cost of credit.

35:1111:95269:52:21:71:543:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:In other words, the percentage growth in small business loan originations in county c from time 0 
35:1112:95367:21:0:72:543:94:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to time 1 can be decomposed into the sum of three components: a contribution from the Top 4, a 
36:1113:95465:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contribution from other large banks, and a contribution from small banks. By definition, each 
36:1114:95559:20:21:71:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:group’s contribution to total origination growth is their initial share of originations at time 0 
36:1115:95657:21:21:71:340:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:multiplied by their origination growth from time 0 to 1. 
36:1116:95714:21:20:107:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A of Table 12 shows estimates of the impact of T4DS on these different components 
36:1117:95802:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of to  tal  bank loan origination growth from 2006 to 2010. (The regressions in Table 12 include our 
36:1118:95903:21:21:71:550:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:full   suite of county-level controls and  correspond to the regression in column (5) of Table 3.) The 
36:1119:96006:21:20:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:first row shows that a county with a T4DS of 100% had   origination growth that was 17.9 p.p. lower 
36:1120:96106:20:21:71:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than an otherwise comparable county with T4DS of 0%. The remaining columns show that the 
36:1121:96195:21:21:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:entire contraction in small business lending from 2006 to 2010 is explained by the contribution of 
36:1122:96294:21:21:71:542:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Top 4 banks. The    second row shows that   from 2010 to 2014 a county with a T4DS of 100% 
36:1123:96389:21:20:71:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rebounded sharply, with loan origination growth 26.6 p.p. greater than a similar county with a 
36:1124:96484:20:21:71:542:481:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B:T4DS of 0%. However, the remaining columns show that the majority of this 2010 to 2014 rebound 
36:1125:96579:21:21:71:563:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is due to other    large banks and small banks. The third row shows that, over the full 2006 to 2014 
36:1126:96680:21:20:71:542:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:period, there is little difference in loan growth between high and low T4DS counties, because more 
36:1127:96779:20:21:71:543:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rapid loan growth at non Top 4 banks from 2010 to 2014 has  offset the initial 2006 to 2010 decline 
36:1128:96879:21:21:71:157:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fro m the Top 4. 
36:1129:96896:21:20:107:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Panel B of Table 12  looks at the group-level growth rates in  the second line of equation 
36:1130:96987:20:21:71:543:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(10). In column (1), we find that the Top 4 bank  s cut their    lending by somewhat less in places 
36:1131:97087:21:21:71:539:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:where they had a larger initial market share. This is precisely what one should expect if county-
36:1132:97184:21:20:71:542:315:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:level loan demand is downward sloping. Specifically, since, in equilibrium, total loan quantities 
36:1133:97282:20:21:71:542:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fall more and interest rates rise more in counties with a higher  initial exposure to the Top 4 banks, 
36:1134:97385:21:21:71:543:274:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Top 4 should find it most attractive to continue their own lending in those counties where they 
36:1135:97485:21:21:71:265:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:previously had the largest market share. 
36:1136:97526:21:20:107:542:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (2) and (3) of Panel B show that lending by other    large    non-   Top 4 banks and 
36:1137:97619:20:21:71:556:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small banks gre w much faster in high T4DS counties from 2010 to 2014. Yet  , these other banks 
36:1138:97715:21:21:71:543:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:did not grow much in high T4DS counties from 2006 to 2010. Thus, it appears to take several years 
36:1139:97813:21:20:71:542:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for   other banks to fill the gap left by the Top 4. This may be because many of these other banks 
36:1140:97912:20:21:71:542:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:were also   highly constrained from 2008 to 2010 at the height of the financial crisis. And their 
36:1141:98010:21:21:71:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:gradual  entry  after  2010  may  reflect external  financing  frictions  ( Myers  and  Majluf [1984]), 
36:1142:98114:21:0:71:542:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:whereby they are not easily able to raise the equity capital needed to expand their lending in 
37:1143:98212:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:affected counties. Moreover, new lenders might face adverse selection when extending credit to 
37:1144:98307:20:21:72:487:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers whose previous banking relationships have been severed (Rajan [1992]).32  
37:1145:98391:21:21:108:542:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:As above, we can also  obtain an instrumental variables (IV) estimate of  the semi-elasticity 
37:1146:98485:21:20:71:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of  non-Top 4 banks’ loan supply. We   do so by considering the cumulative change in interest rates 
37:1147:98585:20:21:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:from 2006 to 2013 along with the other banks’ supply response from 2010 to 2013. These IV 
37:1148:98675:21:21:71:556:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:estimates are shown in columns (5) and (6) of Table 11. For example, in column (5) w  e estimate 
37:1149:98772:21:20:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the semi-elasticity of supply for other banks to be 22 p.p. Again, these estimates are imprecise. 
37:1150:98870:20:21:71:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, the magnitude seems reasonable, hinting that the rising lending volumes from other 
37:1151:98962:21:21:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks that we observe since 2010 can plausibly be linked to the increased cost of credit in affected 
37:1152:99063:21:27:71:117:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties. 
37:1153:99073:27:20:107:309:495:144:Times:144:Times:A:D.3. The response of non-bank lenders 
37:1154:99110:20:21:107:542:475:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, in Table 13, we ask whether the credit supply shock from the Top 4 has led to 
37:1155:99197:21:21:71:543:454:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:substitution towards non-bank lenders. Because these non-bank lenders are not included in the 
37:1156:99291:21:20:71:543:433:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:CRA data, we use proprietary PayNet data.33 Table 13 shows that traditional non-bank lenders 
37:1157:99384:20:21:72:543:413:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have higher loan growth rates from 2010 to 2014 in high Top 4 counties relative to low Top 4 
37:1158:99477:21:21:71:542:392:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties. We also find that, as of 2014, new alternative non-bank lenders, who   only lend via an 
37:1159:99575:21:20:72:543:371:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:online platform, have the greatest presence in high Top 4 counties. As in Kashyap, Stein, and 
37:1160:99669:20:21:71:557:351:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Wil  cox  [1993],  this  substitution  towards non-bank  lenders further supports  the view    that  the 
37:1161:99774:21:21:71:542:330:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:declining bank loan originations in high Top 4 counties are  due to a  reduction in small business 
37:1162:99873:21:20:71:338:309:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit supply as opposed to a decline in credit demand. 
37:1163:99929:20:21:107:543:289:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:More specifically, columns (1) to (3) of Table 13 present the results from cross-sectional 
37:1164:100020:21:22:71:543:268:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:specifications in which we regress the percentage point change in small business loan originations 
37:1165:100118:22:36:72:543:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:by traditional non-bank lenders from 2010 to 2014 in county c, denoted %∆NBLoansc, on T4DSc. 
37:1166:100211:36:19:72:219:210:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:                                                 
37:1167:100260:19:15:72:557:191:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:32 Berger, Bouwman, and    Kim (2017) find that small businesses in areas served by large banks reported being more 
37:1168:100376:15:12:71:542:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:financially constrained during the crisis, but that a greater local presence of small community banks (those with assets 
37:1169:100497:12:10:71:245:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:under $1 billion) helps to offset this effect. 
37:1170:100543:10:15:72:547:154:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:33 Although lender identities are  anonymized in the  PayNet data we use for this analysis,  the  lenders are classified in to  
37:1171:100671:15:11:71:542:139:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:four categories: banks, independent finance companies, captive finance companies, and alternative lenders. We group 
37:1172:100787:11:12:71:542:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:independent finance companies and captive finance companies together as “traditional non-bank lenders.” Captive 
37:1173:100899:12:11:71:541:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:finance companies are the financing subsidiaries of equipment manufacturers who offer customers loans and leases to

38:1177:101267:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The estimate in column (2) means that non-bank small business lending grew by 47  percentage 
38:1178:101359:20:21:72:498:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:points more in a county with a 100% Top 4 share than a county with no Top 4 presence. 
38:1179:101445:21:21:108:543:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Columns (4) to (6) examine lending by the new online small business lenders who have 
38:1180:101530:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:gained prominence in recent years. Data on lending by alternative lenders is only available in 2014. 
38:1181:101631:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, we measure alternative lending in per capita terms: we examine dollar origination by 
38:1182:101727:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:alternative lenders in 2014 divided by 2005 population. We present cross-sectional specifications 
38:1183:101825:21:20:71:543:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in which we regress 2014 alternative lender originations per capita in county c, denoted AltLoansc, 
38:1184:101925:20:21:72:561:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on T4DSc. For example, the coefficient in column (5) impl   ies that per capita originations by these 
38:1185:102027:21:21:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:alternative online lenders are $1.84 higher in counties with a 100% Top 4 share compared to 
38:1186:102119:21:21:72:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties with no Top 4 banks. This can be judged relative to the mean and standard deviation of 
38:1187:102215:21:20:71:542:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:alternative loans per capita of $4.00 and $2.62, respectively. (By way of comparison, per capita 
38:1188:102312:20:21:71:461:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bank loan originations from the CRA database are approximately $650 in 2014.) 
38:1189:102390:21:21:107:543:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Again,  we  can  combine  the  estimates  in  Table  1  3  with     those in  Table 10  to obtain 
38:1190:102488:21:20:71:542:439:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:instrumental variable estimates  of  the semi-elasticity of loan supply from traditional non-bank 
38:1191:102586:20:21:71:543:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:finance companies. These IV estimates are shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 11. In column 
38:1192:102680:21:21:71:555:398:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(3), we estimate the semi-elasticity of supply for non-bank finance companies to be   26 p.p., similar 
38:1193:102783:21:20:71:415:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to our estimate of the semi-elasticity of supply for   non-Top 4 banks. 
38:1194:102855:20:21:107:543:357:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In summary, counties with a large   r  initial Top 4 bank share experienced larger increases in

38:1197:103138:20:21:72:155:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:lenders by 2014.

38:1200:103169:21:20:108:543:232:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:We    have shown that, beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2014, there was a large 
38:1201:103257:20:21:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contraction in the supply of small business lending by the Top 4 banks.  From 2008 to 2010, this 
38:1202:103354:21:21:72:563:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:credit supply shock had a significant impact on  small business activity and employment in those    
38:1203:103454:21:20:72:543:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:counties that were most exposed to the Top 4 banks. Moreover, what we find particularly striking 
38:1204:103550:20:21:72:546:150:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is the gradual nature of the subsequent adjustment process—the fact that it took  several years for 
38:1205:103650:21:21:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:smaller banks and non-bank lenders to  pick up the slack. And, while the total    flow of small 
38:1206:103746:21:20:72:543:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:business credit to affected counties largely recovers by 2014, the cost of credit remains  elevated, 
38:1207:103847:20:0:72:542:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:perhaps  because these  other  lenders are  higher-cost    providers.  Thus,  while  the  impact  on 
39:1208:103951:0:20:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:employment in affected counties dissipates by 2014, the negative impact on local wages persists. 
39:1209:104047:20:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:More generally, due to protracted nature of the adjustment process in credit markets, our findings 
39:1210:104146:21:21:71:564:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that a large credit supply shock from   a subset of lenders can have surprisingly long- lived    
39:1211:104251:21:20:71:184:646:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:effects on real activity. 
39:1212:104277:20:21:108:543:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:However, the  precise  array  of  forces  that led  to  this particular supply  shock remains 
39:1213:104371:21:21:72:543:605:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:unclear. Our reading of the evidence suggests that, from 2008 to 2010, the pullback by the Top 4 
39:1214:104467:21:20:72:557:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reflects a  response to the financial crisis and a reassessment of the ir  comparative advantage in 
39:1215:104567:20:21:71:543:564:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:small business lending. But there are  als o hints that heightened post-crisis regulation may help 
39:1216:104666:21:21:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:explain why the Top 4 were slow to return to small business lending after 2010, even as smaller 
39:1217:104762:21:21:71:543:522:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:banks and non-bank lenders were rapidly expanding in this segment. Going forward, it will be 
39:1218:104855:21:20:71:543:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:useful to better disentangle the causes of this shock. For example, if regulation played an important 
39:1219:104956:20:21:72:581:481:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:role from 2010 to 2014, then understanding the specific rules that contributed the    most    would be 
39:1220:105059:21:0:72:645:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:helpful from a policy perspective. We hope to investigate these questions in future work.
