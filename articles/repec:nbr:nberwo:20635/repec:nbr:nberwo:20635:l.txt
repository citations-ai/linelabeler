2:27:1298:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Direct empirical evidence on whether domestic consumers or foreign exporters bear the burden of
2:28:1393:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:a country's import duties is scarce.  This paper examines the incidence of U.S. sugar duties using a
2:29:1493:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:unique set of high-frequency (weekly, and sometimes daily) data on the landed and the duty-inclusive
2:30:1593:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:price of raw sugar in New York City from 1890 to 1930, a time when the United States consumed
2:31:1686:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:more than 20 percent of world sugar production and was therefore plausibly a "large" country.  The
2:32:1784:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:results reveal a striking asymmetry:  a tariff reduction is immediately passed through to consumer
2:33:1882:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:prices with no impact on the import price, whereas about 40 percent of a tariff increase is passed
2:34:1980:14:14:72:539:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:through to consumer prices and 60 percent borne by foreign exporters.  The apparent explanation
2:35:2075:14:14:72:539:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:for the asymmetric response is the asymmetric response of demand:  imports collapse upon a tariff
2:36:2172:14:42:72:306:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:increase, but do not surge after a tariff reduction.

3:46:2397:14:14:72:152:667:144:Times:144:Times:C:1. Introduction 
3:47:2413:14:14:72:75:653:144:Times:144:Times:C: 
3:48:2413:14:27:72:523:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: One of the classic questions about international trade policy concerns the incidence of 
3:49:2501:27:28:72:532:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import duties.  The classical economists generally assumed that consumers paid the tariff in the 
3:50:2598:28:27:72:521:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:form of higher domestic prices.  Bickerdike (1906) was among the first to note that a country 
3:51:2692:27:28:72:525:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:might be able to shift the burden of its import tariffs onto foreign suppliers by forcing them to 
3:52:2790:28:28:72:540:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reduce their export price.  Provided the elasticity of foreign export supply is not perfectly elastic, 
3:53:2893:28:27:72:515:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Bickerdike showed that some portion of an importing country’s tariff would be absorbed by 
3:54:2983:27:28:72:521:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:foreign exporters, leading him to formulate the elasticity condition for the “optimal” tariff on 
3:55:3080:28:27:72:118:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:imports.  
3:56:3090:27:28:72:515:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: While the theory of tariff incidence is well developed, relatively few studies provide 
3:57:3177:28:28:72:512:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:direct empirical evidence on whether changes in a country’s tariffs affect its import prices.  
3:58:3272:28:27:72:535:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998) find that New Zealand’s extensive tariff reductions in the 
3:59:3364:27:28:72:512:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mid-1980s did not affect the country’s import prices, although few would believe that New 
3:60:3454:28:27:72:511:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Zealand is a good example of a “large” country with monopsony power that could shift the 
3:61:3543:27:28:72:527:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:burden of its import duties onto foreign suppliers.  The United States is more plausibly a large 
3:62:3640:28:27:72:530:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:country, but even here evidence is scarce.1  Feenstra (1989) studied the impact of import duties 
3:63:3737:27:28:72:527:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on Japanese compact trucks and heavyweight motorcycles in the 1980s and concluded that the 
3:64:3828:28:28:72:534:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic price of motorcycles increased by the full extent of the tariff and the domestic price of 
3:65:3927:28:50:72:540:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trucks increased by 60 percent of the tariff, implying that 40 percent of the duty was absorbed by 
3:66:4026:50:7:72:219:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:                                                           
3:67:4084:7:16:72:521:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:1 Kreinin (1961) examined U.S. tariff changes resulting from the 1955 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
3:68:4193:16:12:72:536:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:(GATT) negotiations.  He found that about half of the tariff reductions were passed through to consumer prices and 
3:69:4308:12:11:72:530:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:about half absorbed by exporters in the form of higher export prices, but the use of annual data and the inability to 
3:70:4426:11:0:72:338:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:control for other factors makes this conclusion quite speculative.   
4:71:4497:0:27:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:foreign exporters.  These two papers are the only ones that I am aware of that directly observe 
4:72:4593:27:28:72:335:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:what happens to prices when tariff rates are changed.   
4:73:4649:28:27:72:527:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This scarcity of evidence has led economists to look at indirect ways of assessing tariff 
4:74:4739:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:incidence.  One method is to estimate elasticities of foreign export supply facing an importing 
4:75:4835:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:country with the view that, if those elasticities are less-than-perfectly elastic, import prices might 
4:76:4938:28:27:72:505:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fall if a tariff were imposed.2  For example, Broda, Limão, and Weinstein (2008) estimate 
4:77:5028:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:thousands of export supply elasticities and show that import duties in 15 developing countries are 
4:78:5127:28:27:71:520:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:negatively correlated with those elasticities; i.e., higher duties were imposed on goods where 
4:79:5222:27:28:71:525:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:export supply is relatively inelastic.  While this cross-sectional evidence is consistent with the 
4:80:5321:28:28:71:525:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:optimal tariff argument, they present no evidence on whether the tariffs actually improved the 
4:81:5416:28:27:71:415:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:terms of trade or their removal would deteriorate the terms of trade.3     
4:82:5491:27:28:72:501:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Beyond these efforts, however, there is a notable lack of empirical (as opposed to 
4:83:5574:28:27:72:514:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:computational) evidence on the incidence of tariffs.  Economists have studied the impact of 
4:84:5666:27:28:72:527:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:exchange rate changes, antidumping duties, and preferential tariff reductions on import prices, 
4:85:5762:28:27:72:537:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but these cases would not be expected to have the same impact as a permanent, across-the-board 
4:86:5857:27:28:72:524:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change in import duties on all sources of supply.  For example, exchange rate fluctuations are 
4:87:5952:28:28:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:often temporary whereas tariff changes are more permanent, complicating a comparison between 
4:88:6045:28:62:72:540:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the two (Nakamura and Zerom 2010), while antidumping duties and preferential tariff reductions 
4:89:6140:62:7:72:219:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:                                                           
4:90:6198:7:16:72:522:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:2 Magee and Magee (2008) use estimated trade elasticities along with data on market shares to conclude that the 
4:91:6310:16:7:71:412:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:United States has little scope to influence its terms of trade through policy measures. 
4:92:6398:7:16:72:502:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:3 In fact, it seems unlikely that most of the countries in their sample, such as Belarus, Latvia, Lebanon, and 
4:93:6509:16:11:72:524:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Lithuania, could influence the price of their imports, or that Algeria and Paraguay have more market power than 
4:94:6621:11:12:72:521:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:China and Russia and have optimal tariffs in the range of 200-300 percent.  Furthermore, Nicita, Olarreaga, and 
4:95:6733:12:11:72:522:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Silva (2014) also estimates a large number of export supply elasticities but find virtually no correlation between 
4:96:6848:11:12:72:523:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:their estimates and those of Broda, Limão and Weinstein (the correlation is 0.03). The median optimal tariff is 4 
4:97:6962:12:11:72:529:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:percent in Nicita et al as opposed to the 200-300 percent in Broda et al.  Ludema and Mayda (2014) take a similar 
4:98:7076:11:0:72:241:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:approach to Broda, Limão and Weinstein. 
5:99:7118:0:27:72:507:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:usually apply to only a small number of suppliers and produce trade diversion (Chang and 
5:100:7207:27:28:72:156:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Winters 2002).    
5:101:7225:28:27:72:522:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This paper contributes to our understanding of tariff incidence by employing a unique 
5:102:7311:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data set during a unique historical period.  The paper focuses on a single homogeneous good 
5:103:7403:28:28:72:502:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(raw cane sugar, 96 degrees centrifugal), for which there is excellent high frequency data 
5:104:7494:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(weekly, sometimes daily) on both sides of the tariff wall (the landed import price and the post-
5:105:7591:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:duty market price) in a single location (New York City).  The period under consideration is also 
5:106:7688:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one in which the United States enacted large, unilateral tariff changes that took place abruptly 
5:107:7785:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:without any phase-in period.  Furthermore, the United States accounted for 20 to 25 percent of 
5:108:7880:28:28:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:world consumption of sugar and might therefore be expected to have had significant influence on 
5:109:7976:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the world price of sugar.  (The main foreign supplier of cane sugar, Cuba, sent nearly all of its 
5:110:8074:27:28:72:211:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sugar to the United States.)   
5:111:8105:28:27:72:527:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This paper examines the incidence of the sugar duties by looking at the response of the 
5:112:8193:27:28:72:511:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic and import price of sugar at the time of the changes in those duties, much like the

5:114:8380:27:28:71:536:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1996, Besley and Rosen 1999).  The weekly (and daily) data allow us to examine the changes in 
5:115:8474:28:28:71:507:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic and landed import prices of an identical product in a window around every tariff 
5:116:8564:28:27:71:521:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change; less precise monthly data are also used as a robustness check and to control for other 
5:117:8659:27:28:71:132:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:covariates.   
5:118:8673:28:27:71:499:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: The results reveal a pronounced asymmetry in tariff changes: a tariff reduction is 
5:119:8756:27:28:71:511:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:immediately and fully passed through to the domestic price with no apparent impact on the 
5:120:8846:28:28:71:519:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import price, whereas a tariff increase is shared between a higher domestic price and a lower 
5:121:8940:28:0:71:517:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import price.  The apparent explanation for this asymmetric price response is an asymmetric 
6:122:9034:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand response:  tariff reductions spurred only a slight, immediate increase in demand because 
6:123:9130:27:28:72:497:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:purchasers knew the lower prices would be in effect for the foreseeable future, but tariff 
6:124:9221:28:27:71:540:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increases usually triggered a surge of buying in the weeks prior to the higher duties taking effect, 
6:125:9322:27:28:71:417:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:followed by a severe collapse in purchases for many weeks thereafter.

6:129:9437:14:28:71:520:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: A key issue in determining the impact of any tax on prices is obtaining accurate price 
6:130:9524:28:27:71:534:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data on the good being taxed.  One problem in studying tariff incidence is that import prices are 
6:131:9622:27:28:71:528:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:often calculated as unit values at a fairly high level of aggregation, meaning that the unit value 
6:132:9721:28:28:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:might include many different products each of which might have a different tariff rate associated 
6:133:9819:28:27:71:511:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with it.  This makes it difficult to identify the impact of a particular tariff change on import 
6:134:9916:27:28:71:392:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prices (or domestic prices, which suffer from the same problem).   
6:135:9983:28:27:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This paper overcomes this difficulty by focusing on a very specific homogeneous product 
6:136:10071:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:– raw sugar, 96° centrifugal, the standard commodity grade of traded sugar.4  Willett & Gray’s

6:146:10823:16:0:72:461:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Raw sugar is melted, purified, and crystallized into refined sugar, which is 100 percent sucrose.   
7:147:10925:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Raw sugar is extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets and then refined to become pure 
7:148:11011:27:28:72:505:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:granulated sugar, which is sold to households and food manufacturers.  The United States 
7:149:11100:28:27:71:507:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:produces some cane sugar (in Louisiana and Hawaii) and some beet sugar (in the northern 
7:150:11188:27:28:71:521:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Midwest), but not enough to satisfy domestic demand.  Therefore, the United States has long 
7:151:11280:28:28:71:525:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:been a major importer of raw cane sugar for domestic refining.  In the late nineteenth century, 
7:152:11376:28:27:71:500:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the sugar refining industry was largely located in New York, with some residual refining 
7:153:11465:27:28:71:516:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:capacity in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.  Hence, whether it came from Louisiana or 
7:154:11556:28:27:71:525:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Cuba or other sources of supply, most raw sugar was shipped to New York where plants were 
7:155:11646:27:28:71:355:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:located next to docks for easy unloading and processing.    
7:156:11706:28:28:71:532:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: The United States was a large player in the world sugar market.  As Figure 1 shows, the 
7:157:11794:28:27:71:519:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:United States consumed about 20 to 25 percent of the world’s production of sugar in the late 
7:158:11887:27:28:71:267:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nineteenth and early twentieth century.

8:183:12873:28:28:71:534:165:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1887, the American Sugar Refining Company (ASRC) was formed with the consolidation of 18 
8:184:12962:28:27:71:519:137:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:firms that controlled 80 percent of the industry’s capacity (Genesove and Mullin 1998).  The

8:186:13153:28:0:71:532:82:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:which began production in December 1889, sparking a two-year price war.  This led the ASRC

9:204:13505:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:market share, but the entry of two large plants in late 1898 sparked another price war that lasted 
9:205:13604:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:until June 1900, when some of the competitors consolidated their firms.  However, by the early 
9:206:13699:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1900s, the ASCR’s market share had fallen to about 60 percent.  In 1910, the federal government 
9:207:13795:28:27:71:499:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:filed an antitrust suit against ASRC that was not resolved until a 1922 consent decree.     
9:208:13887:27:28:72:501:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Genesove and Mullin (1998) find that the sugar refining industry was much more 
9:209:13966:28:27:72:506:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:competitive than one might have believed given the ASCR’s market share.  Excluding the 
9:210:14053:27:28:72:511:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:periods of price wars, they find that market conduct was equivalent to a symmetric 10 firm

9:223:14987:16:11:72:510:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:1897, the Payne-Aldrich tariff of 1909, the Underwood tariff of 1913, the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921, the 
9:224:15095:11:0:72:371:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:Fordney-McCumber tariff of 1922, and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of1930.   
10:225:15168:0:27:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Table 1 presents the U.S. import duty on raw sugar during this period.  From 1883 to 
10:226:15253:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1891, the duty was 2.25 cent per pound.6  The McKinley tariff of 1890 generally raised import 
10:227:15347:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:duties, but placed sugar on the duty-free list in order to reduce government revenue, which at that 
10:228:15447:27:28:72:519:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time was excessive (Irwin 1997).  Because the abolition of the sugar duty was going to be an 
10:229:15540:28:28:72:522:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:enormous shock to the domestic sugar cane industry, the legislation stated that the sugar duty 
10:230:15635:28:27:71:540:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would take effect six months after the other duties, on April 1, 1891 instead of October 1, 1890.   
10:231:15735:27:28:71:538:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: In 1894, a 40 percent ad valorem duty on sugar was imposed, followed by a new specific 
10:232:15822:28:27:71:508:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:duty in 1897.  In 1903, the United States granted Cuba a 20 percent reduction in the duties 
10:233:15914:27:28:71:533:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:applied to its products.  This preference, granted in the aftermath of the Spanish-American war, 
10:234:16011:28:28:72:499:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ensured that virtually every pound of Cuban sugar was sent to the U.S. market.  In 1909, 
10:235:16100:28:27:72:508:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Congress enacted a new tariff code but did not change the sugar duty.  The sugar duty was 
10:236:16190:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:scheduled to be abolished in the Underwood tariff of 1913 and a phase out began in March 1914, 
10:237:16285:28:27:72:496:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:at which time the duty was cut to just over 1 cent per pound (Ellison and Mullin 1995).  
10:238:16374:27:28:72:526:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:However, the provision to abolish the sugar duty was suspended when World War I broke out 
10:239:16464:28:28:72:293:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and the federal government needed revenue.

11:284:17274:28:27:72:535:302:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: After World War I, the sugar duty was increased in the Emergency Tariff of 1921 and in 
11:285:17361:27:28:72:529:275:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Fordney-McCumber tariff of 1922, and then again in the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930.  By 
11:286:17453:28:27:72:525:247:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this time, however, imports of sugar from the Philippines had been given duty free treatment.  
11:287:17548:27:28:72:531:220:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, these tariff increases raised the margin of preference given to Philippine sugar.  The 
11:288:17646:28:28:72:539:192:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:trade diversion that resulted could affect the price of Cuban sugar in a very different way than an 
11:289:17746:28:27:72:533:164:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:across-the-board tariff increase.  For this reason, the interwar tariff increases will be considered 
11:290:17847:27:28:72:175:137:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in a separate section. 
11:291:17870:28:27:72:531:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: The mixture of specific and ad valorem duties means that the price of imports is needed 
11:292:17958:27:0:72:512:82:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to calculate the height of the tariff.  Figures 3 shows the ad valorem equivalent of the sugar 
12:293:18056:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:duties from 1890 to 1914 using the import price of raw sugar described above.  (The sample ends 
12:294:18152:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in July 1914 when sugar prices soar due to World War I).  When the sugar duty was abolished in 
12:295:18247:28:27:72:535:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1891, the equivalent ad valorem tariff was about 65 percent, making for a huge tariff reduction.  
12:296:18345:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The tariff was increased significantly in 1894 (from zero to 40 percent) and again in 1987 (from

14:343:20117:27:28:72:529:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Empirical studies of how sales taxes, exchange rates, and import tariffs pass-through to 
14:344:20206:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:consumer prices all use fairly similar methods.  Most studies use monthly data, which allow for 
14:345:20302:27:28:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other controls to be employed in the regression analysis, and a typical estimating equation is 
14:346:20397:28:28:72:191:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:something akin to this:   
14:347:20423:28:28:72:464:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(1) Δ	logሺ݌஽ெሻ௧	ߚ൅ߙൌΔ	log	ሺ1൅߬ሻ௧൅μ	Δ	log	ሺ݌ௐ௉ூሻ௧൅	ߛ	∆logሺܲܫሻ௧ߝ	൅௧ 
14:348:20488:28:27:71:539:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:where pDM is the domestic price of an imported good at time t, τ is the (ad valorem) tariff, pWPI is 
14:349:20589:27:28:71:509:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the domestic wholesale price index at time t, and IP is industrial production (or some other 
14:350:20682:28:27:71:540:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:control for economic activity) at time t.  The regression also typically includes a dummy variable 
14:351:20781:27:28:71:502:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for the month, year, and other factors.  The parameter of interest is β, which indicates the 
14:352:20874:28:28:71:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity of the import price with respect to the import tariff and can be interpreted as the pass-
14:353:20974:28:27:71:519:404:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through coefficient.  To the extent that the tariff increases the domestic price of the imported 
14:354:21071:27:28:71:532:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:good, we would expect that β > 0.  If the tariff is completely passed through to domestic prices, 
14:355:21169:28:27:71:536:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:then β = 1; if the tariff is completely absorbed by foreign exporters, then β = 0.  Unlike previous 
14:356:21267:27:28:71:530:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:studies, we observe sugar prices on both sides of the tariff wall.  Therefore, if import prices are 
14:357:21367:28:28:71:373:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:used as the dependent variable, then β can range from -1 to 0.  
14:358:21430:28:27:71:514:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: During the periods in which the import duty took the form of a specific tariff, the ad 
14:359:21517:27:28:71:481:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:valorem equivalent is constantly changing with movements in the price.  It would be 
14:360:21601:28:27:71:525:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:inappropriate to include these endogenous changes in the tariff as explanatory variables in the 
14:361:21697:27:28:71:501:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regression.  Therefore, in the regressions that follow, the independent tariff variable only 
14:362:21790:28:28:71:533:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:includes changes in the ad valorem tariff equivalent at the time the legislated tariff rate changes 
14:363:21890:28:27:71:521:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:took effect, that is, the truly exogenous, legislated changes in the tariff.  As previously noted, 
14:364:21989:27:0:71:522:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:there are five such exogenous changes between 1890 and 1914, and three exogenous changes 
15:365:22081:0:27:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:between 1920 and 1930 that will be considered in a subsequent section.  The tariff variable is a 
15:366:22178:27:29:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative dummy variable that equals Δ log (1 + τ) = log (1 + τ1) – log (1 + τ0) for the week 
15:367:22275:29:28:72:506:652:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the new tariff takes effect.  This means that the coefficient β indicates the percentage pass-
15:368:22369:28:28:72:495:624:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through to domestic or import prices, depending on which dependent variable is used.    
15:369:22457:28:27:72:541:596:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Because tariff legislation takes time to move through Congress and must be signed by the 
15:370:22546:27:28:72:515:569:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:president, all of the tariff changes were known in advance of their taking effect.  Once tariff 
15:371:22642:28:27:72:495:541:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:legislation was seriously considered by the House Ways and Means Committee, market 
15:372:22725:27:28:72:531:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:participants knew if the sugar duty would be increased or decreased (depending on which party 
15:373:22819:28:28:72:491:486:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:was in power), but the final duty might not be known until the report of the conference 
15:374:22907:28:27:72:519:458:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:committee reconciled the inevitable differences between the House and Senate bill.  The two 
15:375:22999:27:28:72:534:431:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:chambers might take about a week to pass the reconciled bill and then send it to the president to 
15:376:23097:28:27:72:521:403:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sign; usually there was little uncertainty about whether it would be signed or not.  These new 
15:377:23192:27:28:72:530:376:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:duties would remain in effect at least through the next election, if not longer, as passing a tariff 
15:378:23293:28:28:72:531:348:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bill was an arduous political exercise that required unified government (the House, Senate, and 
15:379:23389:28:27:72:322:320:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:presidency controlled by the same political party).   
15:380:23443:27:28:108:522:293:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Because a tariff change was known in advance of its taking place, market participants 
15:381:23529:28:27:72:511:265:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:could take advantage of this information and shift their purchases, potentially exaggerating 
15:382:23622:27:28:72:527:238:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes in import prices.  If the tariff was expected to increase at some date in the near future, 
15:383:23721:28:28:72:512:210:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:purchasers could shift imports in advance of the rate increase, potentially driving up import 
15:384:23815:28:27:72:533:182:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prices in the weeks preceding its imposition and leading to a large decline in import prices after 
15:385:23914:27:28:72:496:155:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff increase.  If the tariff was expected to decrease at some date in the near future, 
15:386:24008:28:27:72:528:127:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:purchasers might postpone importing until after the tax had been reduced, potentially reducing 
15:387:24103:27:0:72:539:100:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import prices prior to the change and then increasing import prices after the change.  In this way, 
16:388:24206:0:27:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these anticipated tariff changes could exaggerate the immediate impact on the import price.  In 
16:389:24302:27:28:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:general, large inventory adjustments to these shifts in demand were not feasible because raw 
16:390:24395:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sugar deteriorates with time and hence firms did not hold large inventories that could be used to 
16:391:24493:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:adjust to tariff changes.  However, it is possible to control for the dynamic price effects simply 
16:392:24592:28:28:72:392:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:by looking at the leads and lags of prices around the tariff shock.   
16:393:24662:28:27:72:519:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: One advantage in using weekly data is that we can identify price changes in a narrow 
16:394:24747:27:28:72:519:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:window around the actual tariff change.  One disadvantage in using weekly data is that other 
16:395:24840:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:potential covariates are not collected at such a high frequency, limiting the number of controls 
16:396:24937:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that can be included in the regression.  However, we can use less refined (so to speak) monthly 
16:397:25033:28:28:72:357:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:B:data to compare the results with and without such controls.

16:401:25109:14:28:72:533:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: We first use equation 1 to examine the immediate impact of tariff changes with no price 
16:402:25197:28:27:71:542:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics.  Table 2 presents the baseline results of the impact of five tariff changes between 1890 
16:403:25296:27:28:71:513:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 1914 on the domestic (tariff inclusive) price and the landed import price in New York.  
16:404:25388:28:27:72:534:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Having both prices here gives us a check on the estimated incidence of both because the sum of 
16:405:25483:27:28:72:521:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the absolute value of the coefficients on import and domestic prices should be approximately 
16:406:25576:28:27:71:538:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one.  Each coefficient by itself represents the percent of the tariff change absorbed by that price.  
16:407:25678:27:28:71:536:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The coefficient on the domestic price should always be positive (because a tariff increase would 
16:408:25775:28:28:71:530:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase the domestic price, and vice versa), whereas the coefficient on the import price should 
16:409:25872:28:27:71:470:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:always be negative (in the large country case) or zero (in the small country case).   
16:410:25958:27:28:71:524:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: As suggested by the data in Figure 3, the abolition of the tariff in 1891 was essentially 
16:411:26048:28:27:71:542:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:completely passed through to domestic consumer prices with no discernible impact on the import 
16:412:26143:27:0:72:533:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:price.  The coefficient of 0.94 indicates that 94 percent of the tariff change was absorbed by the 
17:413:26245:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic price.  The coefficient of -0.03, which is not statistically significant, indicates that the 
17:414:26347:27:28:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:landed price of imports was essentially unchanged.  Both the 1894 and 1897 tariff increases 
17:415:26439:28:27:72:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:appear to have reduced import prices, with 80 percent of the tariff change being absorbed by 
17:416:26532:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:foreign exporters and only 20 percent of the tariff increase being passed through to domestic 
17:417:26626:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:consumers.  The small tariff change in 1903 had little apparent impact on domestic price and the 
17:418:26723:28:27:72:522:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:tariff reduction of 1914, like that in 1891, appears to have been completely passed through to 
17:419:26818:27:28:72:153:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic prices.

18:475:27352:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: As mentioned earlier, there may be some important price dynamics associated with tariff 
18:476:27440:27:28:72:542:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes because the changes are anticipated.  In the case of a tariff increase, domestic consumers 
18:477:27539:28:27:71:523:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may shift their purchases forward in advance of the tariff change, driving up prices before the 
18:478:27635:27:28:72:524:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:tariff takes effect and driving down prices after it takes effect.  In the case of a tariff decrease, 
18:479:27737:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic consumers will shift their purchases back until after the tariff change takes effect, 
18:480:27832:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:driving down prices before the tariff takes effect and driving up prices after it takes effect.  These 
18:481:27935:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dynamics may exaggerate the price changes seen in a narrow one-week window around the time 
18:482:28026:28:27:72:211:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that the tariff takes effect.     
18:483:28060:27:28:72:529:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: To see if there are any such price dynamics around the time of a tariff change, Tables 3 
18:484:28149:28:28:72:534:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:includes two leads and two lags in the regressions using the weekly data.  With the exception of 
18:485:28246:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:one case, it appears that tariff pass-through is nearly instantaneous and contemporaneous with 
18:486:28341:27:28:72:517:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the change in the tariff rate.  In the case of the tariff reductions in 1891 and 1914, there is no 
18:487:28440:28:27:72:516:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change in the interpretation from the previous results: the tariff change is completely passed 
18:488:28535:27:28:72:517:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through to domestic prices with no impact on the import price.  (The reduction in the import 
18:489:28628:28:27:72:503:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:price in week t+1 in 1903 may be noise because the tariff reduction would be expected to 
18:490:28717:27:28:72:265:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase the import price, if anything.)   
18:491:28760:28:28:108:535:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:However, the dynamics change the story for the 1894 tariff increase:  there was a run-up 
18:492:28849:28:27:72:529:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in the import price in the week prior to the tariff increase.  When that is taken into account, the 
18:493:28949:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact of the tariff on the import price falls from 80 percent to 60 percent.  One can also see the 
18:494:29049:28:27:72:539:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impact on domestic prices, which increased by 20 percent of the tariff change two weeks prior to 
18:495:29146:27:28:72:530:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff taking effect and another 20 percent on the week the tariff took effect, suggesting that 
18:496:29246:28:28:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:40 percent of the tariff was passed through to consumer prices.  Yet, it still appears that most of 
18:497:29346:28:0:72:523:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff increase in 1897 was absorbed by a reduction in the import price, although domestic 
19:498:29444:0:27:72:490:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prices increased by nearly 40 percent of the tariff increase.  In this case, the sum of the 
19:499:29536:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients do not approximately equal one, leaving us with some uncertainty about whether the 
19:500:29632:28:27:71:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:pass through was 40 percent on the domestic price and 60 percent on import prices, or more like 
19:501:29728:27:28:72:283:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:20 percent domestic and 80 percent import.

23:698:32631:0:13:72:202:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:Explaining the Asymmetry 
23:699:32656:13:14:72:75:695:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C: 
23:700:32656:14:28:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: What explains the asymmetry in which tariff reductions have little impact on import 
23:701:32740:28:27:72:534:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prices while tariff increases reduce import prices?7 The most straightforward explanation is that 
23:702:32838:27:28:72:525:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the response of demand to tariff increases and decreases is not symmetric.  The key is not just 
23:703:32934:28:28:72:529:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that tariff changes are anticipated, but also that they are expected to be (relatively) permanent.  
23:704:33034:28:27:72:533:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:When the tariff is known to increase at some specific date in the near future, there is a powerful 
23:705:33133:27:28:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:incentive to import foreign goods prior to the date at which the tariff takes effect.  When the 
23:706:33229:28:27:72:505:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:tariff is known to decrease at some specific date in the near future, there is an incentive to 
23:707:33324:27:28:72:523:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:postpone or delay importing until after the tariff is reduced, but there is no strong incentive to 
23:708:33423:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import large quantities immediately after the lower tariff takes effect.  Because the lower tariffs 
23:709:33523:28:27:72:512:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:will be in effect for many months or years after a tariff bill is passed, there is no urgency to 
23:710:33620:27:28:72:275:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import more within a specific time frame. 
23:711:33662:28:27:108:508:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 6 demonstrates this asymmetry by presenting the year-over-year percentage 
23:712:33743:27:28:71:532:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change in monthly import volume for three months before and after a tariff change.  In the case 
23:713:33839:28:27:71:512:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the three tariff reductions (1891, 1903, and 1914), the lines are fairly flat.  There is some 
23:714:33936:27:28:71:541:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of a slowdown in imports in the month prior to the tariff reduction, particularly in 1914, 
23:715:34036:28:28:71:384:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but no major surge in imports after the lower tariff takes effect.   
23:716:34105:28:27:107:527:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:The pattern is quite different for the two tariff increases (1894, 1897).  The response to 
23:717:34196:27:28:71:523:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the 1894 tariff increase, which took the sugar duty from zero to 40 percent, is most dramatic.  
23:718:34292:28:27:71:529:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Import surged more than 200 percent (from a year earlier) two months prior to the higher tariff 
23:719:34388:27:28:71:534:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:taking effect, and then collapsed, falling by a large amount and remaining depressed for several 
23:720:34485:28:28:72:534:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:months after the tariff took effect.  While there was no run-up in imports prior to the imposition 
23:721:34584:28:8:72:219:101:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:F:                                                           
23:722:34642:8:19:72:531:93:42:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:7 Asymmetric price adjustment to cost or tax shocks have been found in many other cases, such 
23:723:34735:19:0:72:331:74:144:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:B:as gasoline (Borenstein, Cameron, and Gilbert 1997). 
24:724:34790:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the 1897 tariff increase, imports also remained significantly depressed for 3-4 months after it 
24:725:34889:27:28:71:135:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:took effect.   
24:726:34904:28:27:107:542:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:In the case of 1894, why does the impact occur two months prior to the tariff increase and 
24:727:34995:27:28:71:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not the month before?  A plausible explanation is that once the Senate seems close to passing the 
24:728:35093:28:28:71:505:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:bill, the chance of the new tariff taking effect goes up significantly, although there will be 
24:729:35188:28:27:71:537:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:tremendous uncertainty about the exacting timing of when it will be imposed.  Therefore, giving 
24:730:35284:27:28:71:517:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the ordering and shipping lags between Cuba and New York, merchants did not want to risk 
24:731:35373:28:27:71:309:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:paying a higher duty on a large imported cargo.

25:754:35761:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Thus, the import price of sugar does not increase after a tariff reduction because there is 
25:755:35853:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:no surge in demand, and therefore no immediate pressure put on existing supply, after the tariff 
25:756:35950:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change.  Conversely, the import price of sugar falls significantly after a tariff increase because 
25:757:36049:27:28:72:440:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:refiner demand falls sharply in the immediate aftermath of the tariff change. 
25:758:36127:28:28:108:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:Supply side factors might also account for the lack of any price increase after a U.S. tariff 
25:759:36221:28:27:72:501:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reduction (Marion and Muehlegger 2011).  In particular, if the Cuban sugar industry was 
25:760:36309:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:characterized by excess capacity, then additional output could accommodate any increase in U.S. 
25:761:36405:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demand with a tariff reduction with no increase in costs.  Furthermore, shipments to Europe and 
25:762:36501:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:other markets could be diverted to the U.S. market if there was an increase in demand.  With a 
25:763:36596:28:28:72:520:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fall in demand, Cuban producers might be forced to take a reduction in price if they continue 
25:764:36690:28:27:72:508:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:producing at previous levels in order to pay off the fixed costs of running the sugar mill or

25:769:36811:14:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This section considers two extensions of the previous analysis:  (1) a robustness check 
25:770:36899:27:28:72:539:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:using a different set of monthly prices, which allows for control of other influences on price, and 
25:771:36999:28:28:72:491:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(2) a look at the pass-through of raw sugar prices to granulated (refined) sugar prices.   
25:772:37090:28:14:72:149:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:Monthly Prices 
25:773:37105:14:13:72:75:225:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C: 
25:774:37105:13:28:72:532:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: One problem with using weekly data is that it is difficult to control for other factors that 
25:775:37198:28:27:72:541:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may be influencing price movements.  The advantage of using monthly prices is that controls can 
25:776:37294:27:28:72:506:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:be included for other covariates, such as wholesale prices and industrial production, in the 
25:777:37387:28:28:72:539:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:regression analysis.  The disadvantage of using monthly prices is that commodity prices (such as 
25:778:37484:28:0:72:524:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sugar) are much more volatile than finished goods prices and the monthly data can mask high 
26:779:37579:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:frequency (intra-month) price movements that might help make more precise any inference about 
26:780:37673:27:28:72:247:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the impact of specific tax changes.   
26:781:37711:28:27:108:529:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:These monthly data provide a check on the weekly results since they rely on a different 
26:782:37799:27:28:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:source for the sugar prices.  However, monthly data only exist for the import price, not the 
26:783:37892:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic (post-customs) price, of sugar.  The standard import price series is a unit value (value

26:785:38082:27:28:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:reported in the Monthly Summary of the Foreign Commerce of the United States.  The unit value 
26:786:38176:28:27:72:511:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:is based on aggregate U.S. imports in a given month; it is not specific to New York City or

26:788:38287:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Table 4 reports the results of estimating equation (1) with a monthly lead and lag in the

26:791:38562:28:27:72:533:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:discernible change in the monthly import price, consistent with the findings reported above that 
26:792:38659:27:28:72:536:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff reduction was passed through to purchasers of raw sugar.  In the case of the 1894 tariff 
26:793:38759:28:27:72:535:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increase, the import price does fall in the month the tariff is imposed, but is also increases about 
26:794:38860:27:28:72:511:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to its previous level in the next month.  In 1897, the behavior of prices is different: average 
26:795:38956:28:28:72:502:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prices increase in advance of the tariff change and then fall after the tariff was imposed.   
26:796:39050:28:27:108:535:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A:While these results are consistent with the previous findings about a tariff decrease, they 
26:797:39142:27:28:72:539:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are less clear about the impact of the two tariff increases.  The problems with using monthly data

27:904:41473:28:0:72:524:86:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff change takes effect.  Around the time of the three tariff reductions, import prices are 
28:905:41575:0:27:72:516:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fairly stable, but they fall significantly – around 25 percent – after the two tariff increases in 
28:906:41674:27:28:71:516:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1894 and 1897.  (The 25 percent reduction in 1894 is roughly consistent with the 80 percent 
28:907:41766:28:27:71:506:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:absorption of the 34 percentage point change in tariffs in table 2,)  However, the pattern is 
28:908:41860:27:28:71:511:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:different in these two cases:  in the case of the 1894 increase, prices are stable and then fall 
28:909:41957:28:28:71:509:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:significantly (and remain low), whereas in the case of the 1897 increase, import prices rise 
28:910:42050:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:significantly two months prior to the tariff taking effect and then fall back to their previous level.  
28:911:42154:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, the only clear cut evidence of a higher tariff reducing the price of imports is in 1894; recall 
28:912:42256:28:27:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as well that the pattern of the quantity of sugar imports is consistent with a larger price impact in

29:943:43119:27:28:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:“administered” price with infrequent changes, whereas the price of raw sugar changes almost 
29:944:43211:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:every week.  According to the Census of Manufactures for 1909, the cost of materials comprised 
29:945:43306:28:27:72:511:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:90 percent of the value of products in the sugar refining industry; therefore, any significant

29:947:43500:28:27:71:106:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:goods.

29:949:43591:28:28:71:511:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:through to the wholesale price of granulated sugar.  This was a period in which there was a 
29:950:43683:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:“price war” between the American Sugar Refining Company and new entrants (Genesove and

29:952:43863:28:27:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:granulated sugar in a two week window of the event.  However, this window may be too narrow 
29:953:43955:27:28:72:530:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to determine the true extent of pass-through because the frequency of adjustment of granulated 
29:954:44050:28:27:72:360:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sugar prices was so much lower than with raw sugar prices.

30:1024:45091:27:28:71:512:307:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: The tariff changes in the interwar period have a slightly different character than pre-
30:1025:45178:28:27:72:538:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:World War I tariff changes since another major foreign supplier, the Philippines, was given duty 
30:1026:45275:27:28:72:524:252:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:free treatment.  Although Philippine sugar received this treatment in 1909, the Philippines did 
30:1027:45371:28:28:72:539:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:not emerge as a major sugar exporter to the United States until after the war.  This change makes 
30:1028:45469:28:27:72:521:196:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the tariff increases in 1921, 1922, and 1930 more like an increase in the margin of preference 
30:1029:45564:27:28:72:539:169:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:given to Philippine sugar than a uniform, across-the-board tariff increase as was the case prior to 
30:1030:45664:28:27:72:540:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:World War I.  As Chang and Winters (2002) note in the context of preferential trade agreements, 
30:1031:45760:27:0:72:520:114:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increasing the tariff on Cuban (and other imported) sugar would lead to trade diversion and a 
31:1032:45857:0:27:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:terms-of-trade gain for the preferred country (the Philippines) and a terms-of-trade loss for the 
31:1033:45955:27:28:72:203:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:excluded country (Cuba).   
31:1034:45982:28:27:72:539:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Figure 6 shows the weekly ad valorem tariff on imported sugar (using the delivered price 
31:1035:46071:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:in New York).  The tariff increase in 1921 is pronounced, but the smaller increase in 1922 is 
31:1036:46165:28:28:72:512:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:more difficult to detect. Because of the interaction between the deflation after 1929 and the 
31:1037:46259:28:27:72:515:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:specific duty, the ad valorem tariff rose from about 80 percent to nearly 200 percent by mid-

31:1045:46620:28:27:72:534:139:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:changes on sugar prices.  In 1921, sugar prices were falling rapidly during a period of deflation, 
31:1046:46719:27:28:72:502:112:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:but they started to rise in 1922.  Given the scale of the price changes, the tariff changes – 
31:1047:46813:28:0:72:466:84:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:amounting to just a fraction of a cent in some cases – are very difficult to detect.

32:1060:47156:28:27:72:528:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:In two of the three cases (1921 and 1930), the import price from Cuba seems to bear the entire 
32:1061:47251:27:28:72:533:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:burden of the tariff.  However, the smaller tariff increase in 1922 seems to have been passed on 
32:1062:47348:28:28:72:532:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to consumers and is reflected in the New York price (although the coefficient is not statistically

33:1123:48636:28:27:72:533:292:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:imported sugar was falling rapidly; while the domestic price does increase slightly the day after 
33:1124:48734:27:28:71:524:265:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the new tariff takes effect, it quickly falls with the landed import price.  In 1922, the domestic 
33:1125:48833:28:27:72:508:237:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:price increases the full extent of the new duty on Monday, September 25.  By contrast, the 
33:1126:48924:27:28:72:532:210:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic price of sugar is unchanged in 1930 while the import price falls by the 0.24 cent tariff

35:1189:49351:27:28:71:521:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Yet the conclusion that Cuba bore the brunt of the import duties should not come as a 
35:1190:49437:28:28:71:502:362:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:surprise, given the nature of the preferential tariff increase.  Table 8 shows that there was 
35:1191:49531:28:27:71:516:334:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:substantial trade diversion as a result of the 1930 tariff increase.  The higher tariff on Cuban 
35:1192:49628:27:28:71:510:307:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sugar (and that from other sources of supply) shifted demand away from those imports and 
35:1193:49717:28:27:71:513:279:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:toward imports from the Philippines.  In comparison with the first six months of 1930, U.S. 
35:1194:49809:27:28:71:527:252:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:imports from Cuba fell 13 percent while imports from the Philippines rose 11 percent.  During 
35:1195:49903:28:28:71:535:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:this era of sharp price deflation, the average price of Cuban sugar fell by a third, but the average 
35:1196:50004:28:27:71:538:196:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:price of Philippines sugar fell by 11 percent.  Because this tariff increase was not uniform across 
35:1197:50104:27:28:71:518:169:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:import suppliers and resulted in significant trade diversion, the adverse effect of the tariff on 
35:1198:50202:28:27:71:513:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Cuba’s export price (and the improvement in the Philippine export price) is not a surprise.

36:1253:50907:28:27:72:144:363:144:Times:144:Times:C:6. Conclusion 
36:1254:50921:27:28:72:540:336:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:B: This paper seeks to bring new evidence on the age old question of “who pays the tariff?,” 
36:1255:51011:28:27:72:524:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a question for which there is surprisingly little empirical evidence.  By looking at some of the 
36:1256:51108:27:28:72:534:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:biggest tariff shocks in American history, in relation to a commodity in which the United States 
36:1257:51205:28:27:72:541:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:was a large purchaser, we have an opportunity to see whether the United States was able to act as 
36:1258:51303:27:28:72:477:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:a “large country” and shift some of the burden of its tariff onto its trading partners.   
36:1259:51393:28:28:72:521:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: This paper uncovers evidence of an interesting asymmetry: while tariff reductions are 
36:1260:51479:28:27:72:541:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:passed on wholly to domestic consumers, the burden of tariff increases seems to be split between 
36:1261:51576:27:28:72:535:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domestic consumers and foreign producers.  The apparent explanation for this asymmetric price 
36:1262:51670:28:27:72:528:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:response is an asymmetric demand response: in advance of a tariff increase, imports surge and 
36:1263:51764:27:0:72:536:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:then collapse when the tariff takes effect, whereas imports do not slump before and surge after a 
37:1264:51865:0:27:72:510:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:tariff reduction.  This implies that even potentially large countries need not fear an adverse 
37:1265:51960:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:terms-of-trade effect from a unilateral tariff reduction, although they might be able to improve 
37:1266:52057:28:27:72:511:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:their terms of trade by unilaterally imposing higher tariffs on imports (Bagwell and Staiger
