2:40:2507:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Prior  literature  has  established  that  displaced  workers  suffer  persistent  earnings  losses  by 
2:41:2611:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:following workers in administrative data after mass layoffs. This literature assumes that these are 
2:42:2710:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:involuntary separations  owing  to  economic  distress.  This  paper  examines  this  assumption  by 
2:43:2810:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:matching  survey data  on  worker-supplied  reasons  for  separations  with  administrative  data. 
2:44:2908:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:Workers exhibit substantially different earnings dynamics in mass layoffs depending on the rea- 
2:45:3003:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:son for separation. Using a new methodology to account for the increased separation rates across 
2:46:3099:14:14:71:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:all  survey  responses  during  a  mass layoff,  the  paper  finds  earnings  loss  estimates  that  are 
2:47:3203:14:42:71:348:490:12:Times:12:Times:surprisingly close to those using only administrative data.

3:67:3604:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A  significant  literature  using  administrative  data  finds  large  and  persistent  earnings  losses
3:68:3708:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for displaced workers (e.g., Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) and Davis and von Wachter
3:69:3801:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2011)).  This literature assumes that the when a firm is contracting by 30% or more, the workers
3:70:3898:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who separate do so because of economic distress at the firm.  It is not obvious, however, that all
3:71:3996:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separations in these events are due to economic distress.  For example, even when a firm is con-
3:72:4092:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracting by 30% or more, some workers might be quitting to better jobs.  Such quits would lead to
3:73:4189:20:21:72:405:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a downward bias in estimates of the earnings effects of displacements.
3:74:4259:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To quantify this bias, this paper links worker survey data to administrative data.  Survey data
3:75:4354:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:provides information about workers’ perceptions about their reason for separation, and thus allows
3:76:4452:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:us to distinguish between cases where workers’ stated reason agree and disagree with the assumption
3:77:4551:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that all separations in a mass layoff are displacements.  The central difficulty lies in how to interpret
3:78:4656:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:worker survey responses.  Specifically, does the survey response represent the proximate or ultimate
3:79:4756:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reason for separations?  We interpret the proximate reason as being what the worker reports in the
3:80:4854:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey.  Some separations reported as a quit, however, may have been caused by economic distress
3:81:4950:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the firm.  For example, the worker might have searched for a job in anticipation of the layoff.  In
3:82:5052:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this case, the researcher would not want to take the survey response at face value and infer an error
3:83:5153:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the administrative data.  Hence, we interpret the firm contraction to be the ultimate reason for
3:84:5252:20:20:72:480:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separation if, in the absence of the contraction, the worker would not have separated.
3:85:5338:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper develops an approach to combine information in administrative and survey data to
3:86:5429:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assess the magnitude of possible biases in the administrative data, while distinguishing between the
3:87:5529:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proximate and ultimate reasons for separations in the survey data.  The main idea is to compare
3:88:5624:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the separation probabilities and earnings losses of workers reporting particular survey reasons at
3:89:5722:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively stable firms (i.e., neither growing nor shrinking), to those at firms contracting by 30%
3:90:5821:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or more.  We interpret the difference in the separation probabilities and the composition-adjusted
3:91:5919:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings  losses  as  reflecting  the  causal  role  of  the  firm  contracting  on  both  the  probability  of
3:92:6030:21:20:72:246:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separating as well as earnings losses.
3:93:6068:20:20:88:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our approach provides estimates of the share of separations at firms that are contracting by
3:94:6160:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:30% or more that are caused by the separation, which we refer to as latent displacements, as well
3:95:6257:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as the earnings losses in the separations caused by the contraction.  In terms of separations, when
3:96:6356:20:47:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a firm contracts, only 55% of the survey responses indicate that the worker’s proximate cause of
3:97:6452:47:0:303:308:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1
4:98:6453:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separation was firm-level distress.  Our approach finds, however, that much of this misalignment
4:99:6549:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between survey and administrative measures represents workers reporting proximate rather than
4:100:6642:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ultimate  reasons  for  separations,  so  that  about  85%  of  the  separations  were  caused  by  the  firm
4:101:6751:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contraction.  In terms of earnings losses,  we uncover substantial heterogeneity in earnings losses
4:102:6850:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depending on the alignment between survey and administrative data.  Our estimate of the latent
4:103:6944:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings losses of displaced workers, however, is quite similar to the estimate using administrative
4:104:7044:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data alone.  Thus, we conclude that the magnitude of the biases in administrative data measures
4:105:7139:21:20:72:196:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of displacement are small.
4:106:7165:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also use our link between survey and administrative data to revisit the treatment of earn-
4:107:7258:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ings histories with zeros.  A common practice in the displaced worker literature is to drop earnings
4:108:7358:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:histories with a sufficient number of zeros post-displacement.  The reason is that in typical adminis-
4:109:7460:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trative datasets the researcher does not know whether the zeros are because of non-participation or
4:110:7559:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unemployment.  Our survey-administrative data link allows us to include only the zeros of workers
4:111:7656:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who are unemployed and thus still looking for work.  Including these zeros approximately doubles
4:112:7752:20:20:72:298:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the magnitude of the persistent earnings losses.
4:113:7800:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper that is most similar to this one is von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012).
4:114:7891:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:They link the Displaced Worker Survey (DWS) to California administrative data and assess the
4:115:7983:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:alignment between the survey data and the administrative data and see how earnings losses vary
4:116:8077:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depending on the alignment.  Our use of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
4:117:8170:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allows us to ask different questions than von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012) can ask
4:118:8264:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the DWS. Specifically, workers only appear in the DWS if they report being displaced.  There
4:119:8361:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are  thus  two  reasons  why  a  worker  might  not  appear  in  the  DWS.  First,  a  worker  may  have
4:120:8465:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forgotten  that  they  were  displaced.   Second,  they  might  have  remembered  that  they  separated,
4:121:8569:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but  did  not  perceive  it  as  a  displacement.   Because  respondents  are  asked  retrospectively  about
4:122:8677:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  last  three  years,  what  they  remember  about  the  event  might  depend  on  what  subsequently
4:123:8781:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:happened to them.  This saliency bias is precisely what von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth
4:124:8874:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2012) work hard to address.  The SIPP has the benefit that workers are asked about separations
4:125:8969:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that occur in the last quarter and so there is less concern about recall bias (in particular, recall
4:126:9069:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that conditions on outcomes).  In addition, SIPP respondents can report a reason for separating
4:127:9164:20:47:72:191:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that is not displacement.

5:130:9284:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the procedure for linking them.  Section 2 documents what workers say when the administrative
5:131:9377:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data would label them as displaced, and what the administrative data says when workers say they
5:132:9472:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were displaced.  Section 3 describes how we estimate earnings changes following a separation.  It
5:133:9569:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also shows that there is substantial heterogeneity in earnings changes conditional on a worker being
5:134:9669:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displaced, depending on what reason the worker gives for separating.  Section 4 describes how we
5:135:9765:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:combine the information in (mis)alignment between the survey and administrative data to measure
5:136:9860:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the earnings losses associated with the firm contracting.  It also reports the results of implementing
5:137:9962:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our method.  Section 5 reports the results of including the zeros of workers still looking for work.
5:138:10062:20:44:72:168:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Section 6 concludes.
5:139:10082:44:31:72:319:482:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1    Survey and administrative data
5:140:10117:31:28:72:200:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.1    Data description
5:141:10140:28:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use two datasets:  the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the adminis-
5:142:10232:20:20:72:366:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trative Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD).
5:143:10288:20:21:88:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The SIPP is a U.S. Census Bureau survey.  It is a nationally representative series of panels with
5:144:10385:21:20:72:540:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a sample size of between 14,000 and 36,000 households per panel.  We use the 2001 and 2004 panels,
5:145:10483:20:20:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which span the years 2000 to 2006.  Each SIPP panel is conducted in waves and rotation groups,
5:146:10577:20:21:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with each wave consisting of a 4-month period during which an interviewer contacts a household.
5:147:10672:21:20:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  sample  is  divided  into  four  rotation  groups,  where  one  rotation  group  is  interviewed  each
5:148:10779:20:20:72:527:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:month.  During the interview, the household is asked information about the previous 4 months.
5:149:10872:20:21:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The SIPP contains information on up to two jobs held by each person in the household, along
5:150:10963:21:20:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the starting and (potential) ending dates of those jobs.  If a respondent identifies that a job has
5:151:11067:20:20:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ended, they are prompted to identify the reason that the job has ended from a list of 14 possible
5:152:11164:20:21:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:answers  (see  Table  1  for  the  complete  list).   In  addition,  it  provides  information  on  labor  force
5:153:11276:21:20:72:448:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:participation.  Those identified as not working are asked to identify the reason.
5:154:11357:20:16:88:539:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The LEHD dataset is built from administrative unemployment insurance records.1It contains
5:155:11446:16:15:87:539:143:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1We  have  access  to  all  49  states  (plus  the  District  of  Columbia)  that  participate  in  the  LEHD  program,  and
5:156:11570:15:11:72:540:128:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the  data  we  have  available  runs  through  2011.   See  Abowd  et  al.  (2009)  and  McKinney  and  Vilhuber  (2008)  for
5:157:11695:11:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:discussion of the background and contents of the LEHD files.  Over 90 percent of payroll employment is covered by
5:158:11808:11:35:72:221:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the unemployment insurance system.
5:159:11842:35:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3
6:160:11843:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unique person identifiers that allow us to follow workers across employers.  Similarly,  it contains
6:161:11943:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unique  employer  identifiers  that  allow  us  to  follow  employers  over  time  and  construct  employer
6:162:12050:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:growth rates.  The unit of analysis on the employer side is the state-level enterprise identification
6:163:12151:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number (SEIN). While multiple establishments may have the same SEIN in a particular state, the
6:164:12245:21:36:72:324:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:definition of the enterprise does not cross state lines.
6:165:12301:36:27:72:221:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.2    Matching procedure
6:166:12326:27:21:72:539:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We link the jobs in the SIPP to jobs in the LEHD. While there is a bridge betweenpeoplein the
6:167:12419:21:20:72:346:543:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:SIPP and the LEHD, there is not a bridge betweenjobs.2
6:168:12473:20:20:88:539:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To align with the interest in the displaced worker literature in high-tenure workers we look at
6:169:12568:20:21:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:SIPP jobs with at least 12 months of tenure.  We then link a SIPP job that ends to an LEHD job
6:170:12662:21:28:72:155:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on three features.
6:171:12680:28:21:85:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1.  The  LEHD  job  has  four  consecutive  quarters  of  positive  earnings  that  exceed  a  minimal
6:172:12782:21:29:99:463:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:threshold (earning the minimum wage at 70% of full-time equivalent hours);
6:173:12856:29:20:85:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2.  In the four quarters following the survey-reported separation, the worker has at most minimal
6:174:12953:20:21:99:539:384:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:earnings from the employer (earnings fall below the threshold defined in the previous bullet);3
6:175:13048:21:29:99:117:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and
6:176:13051:29:20:85:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3.  The LEHD job ends either in the quarter that the SIPP job is reported to end, or one quarter
6:177:13147:20:29:99:361:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before or after the SIPP job is reported to have ended.
6:178:13202:29:20:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The first requirement means that both jobs meet a tenure threshold and are both plausibly full time.
6:179:13302:20:20:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The second requirement attempts to capture permanent separations.  The third requirement follows
6:180:13398:20:21:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from our interest in comparing reasons for separations, rather than the reporting of separations. The
6:181:13499:21:20:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:window around the separation allows for the possibility that workers continue to receive paychecks
6:182:13597:20:20:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after a separation.  In cases where this procedure yielded more than one match we gave priority to
6:183:13695:20:21:72:415:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the job with the highest earnings in the quarter prior to the separation.
6:184:13768:21:20:88:539:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For linking continuing jobs (i.e., jobs that do not end) in the SIPP to the LEHD we follow a
6:185:13860:20:16:72:511:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar procedure to above, except that we do not impose the requirement that the job end.
6:186:13950:16:11:87:378:127:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2This person-level bridge has been used before (e.g.  Celik et al. (2012)).
6:187:14025:11:15:87:539:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3This four quarters of minimal earnings is similar to Schoeni and Dardia (1996, pg.  5), which they also use to
6:188:14136:15:30:72:200:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:alleviate concerns about recalls.
6:189:14169:30:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:4
7:190:14170:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix A provides additional details on the criteria, as well as the resulting match rates.  The
7:191:14268:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:main sample frame consists of person-quarters in the SIPP that have been matched to the LEHD.
7:192:14361:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A  given  person  might  appear  multiple  times  in  the  dataset.   We  impose  two  additional  sample
7:193:14466:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrictions.  First, we require that the worker be between the age of 25 to 74 in the calendar year of
7:194:14569:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the observation.  Second, we require that the employer have at least 50 workers three quarters prior
7:195:14669:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the candidate quarter (see appendix Tables A1 and A2 for comparisons of our sample selection
7:196:14764:20:21:72:192:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:criteria to other studies).
7:197:14791:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One might worry that some of what we label as a mass layoff is simply that the employer ID
7:198:14881:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has changed.  In Appendix B we detail how we used employee flows to clean spurious shutdowns
7:199:14973:20:44:72:224:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and other employer ID changes.
7:200:15003:44:31:72:492:482:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2    Alignment between survey and administrative measures
7:201:15060:31:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The literature has used both administrative and survey measures to study displaced workers.  Both
7:202:15157:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures  present  measurement  challenges.   On  the  one  hand,  the  administrative  measure  might
7:203:15259:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capture separations that are unrelated to economic distress.  On the other hand, the survey measure
7:204:15358:21:20:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:might be contaminated by self-serving reports, or might not capture the concept that the researcher
7:205:15457:20:20:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is interested in.  This section first details both measures and then documents the alignment between
7:206:15557:20:37:72:353:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the two measures in our linked administrative-survey data.
7:207:15615:37:27:72:274:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.1    Administrative data measure
7:208:15649:27:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The standard approach in administrative data is to classify separations based on information from
7:209:15746:20:21:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:net worker flows.  In particular, a large net contraction is taken as evidence of firm distress, and
7:210:15846:21:20:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the event as a whole is referred to as a mass layoff.  We follow the practice in this literature of
7:211:15945:20:20:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:defining a mass layoff as occurring when employment falls by 30% or more.  Table A2 highlights
7:212:16039:20:21:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the commonality across papers using administrative data of this definition, which originates with
7:213:16136:21:20:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993).  While this cutoff may seem arbitrary, the findings in this
7:214:16235:20:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paper suggest that it does a reasonable job of mainly picking up separations that are caused by the
7:215:16334:20:21:72:437:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employer contraction, in a sense that we develop more formally in Section 4.
7:216:16410:21:20:88:539:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use a one-year window around when the worker separated to measure the employer growth
7:217:16498:20:31:72:540:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate.  Specifically, we measure the firm’s employment three quarters before the separation and one
7:218:16596:31:0:303:308:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5
8:219:16597:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quarter after the separation.  If the decline in employment over this period exceeds 30%, then we
8:220:16694:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:label this a mass layoff.  This one-year time window is in line with recent literature, i.e.  Andersson
8:221:16797:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et  al.  (2014)  and  Davis  and  von  Wachter  (2011).   In  contrast,  Jacobson,  LaLonde,  and  Sullivan
8:222:16904:20:21:72:239:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1993) allow for a six year window.
8:223:16939:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Appendix C we discuss other ways of measuring separations due to economic distress that
8:224:17029:20:36:72:223:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have appeared in the literature.
8:225:17061:36:28:72:231:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.2    Survey data measures
8:226:17088:28:20:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  SIPP  provides  information  from  workers  about  their  perceptions  of  the  circumstances  sur-
8:227:17192:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rounding the separation.  Researchers typically use the worker-reported reasons from the survey to
8:228:17290:20:21:72:494:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classify separations into those owing to economic distress at the firm, and other reasons.
8:229:17380:21:20:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Because of the multiple survey response options in the SIPP and the relatively small sample
8:230:17471:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sizes, we classify the survey responses into three groups:distress,quitandother. We map the follow-
8:231:17570:20:21:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing four reasons for separation todistress:  1) On layoff,42) Employer went bankrupt, 3) Employer
8:232:17667:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sold business, and 4) Slack work or business conditions.  To identify workerquits, we narrow in on
8:233:17765:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the employer-to-employer transitions that is the subject of interest in the literature and thereby
8:234:17863:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrict to survey reports of 1) Quit to take another job.  Finally, we classify the remaining reasons
8:235:17965:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for separation into anothercategory:  1) Retirement or old age,  2) Other family/personal/child
8:236:18060:20:20:71:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:obligations,  3)  Own  illness/injury,  4)  School  or  training,  5)  Job  was  temporary  and  ended,  6)
8:237:18167:20:21:71:502:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Unsatisfactory work arrangement, 7) Quit for some other reason, and 8) Discharged/fired.
8:238:18255:21:20:88:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Other surveys that have been used to study displacements capture a slightly different combina-
8:239:18349:20:20:71:539:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion of reasons. The most common surveys used are the DWS and the PSID, although other research
8:240:18444:20:20:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has used the HRS, the NLSY, and the SIPP. von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012) com-

8:245:18905:10:11:72:540:177:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in the four quarters following the report of “on layoff.”  We have conducted robustness checks where we exclude the
8:246:19020:11:94:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:small share of workers who have earnings starting five quarters after separation from their pre-displacement employer.

9:249:19193:28:20:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Using our aggregated survey categories, Table 1 shows that the survey and administrative measures
9:250:19290:20:20:72:539:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are aligned, though not perfectly.  For example, of the separations where workers reportdistressin
9:251:19388:20:21:72:539:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the survey data, 28% occur during a mass layoff.  In contrast, only 5% of worker reportedquits,
9:252:19483:21:20:71:417:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 6% of worker reportedotherreasons, occurred during a mass layoff.
9:253:19552:20:20:88:539:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Even  within  the  aggregated  survey  categories,  the  survey  and  administrative  measures  are
9:254:19651:20:21:71:539:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlated.   All  of  the  survey  reasons  we  classify  asotherhave  lower  shares  of  the  mass  layoff
9:255:19759:21:20:71:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicator than the survey reasons we classify asdistress.  Within the survey reasons we classify as
9:256:19858:20:20:71:539:539:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:distress, the fact that the employer went bankrupt/sold business has the highest share of the mass
9:257:19956:20:21:71:228:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:layoff indicator also makes sense.
9:258:19990:21:20:88:539:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Despite  this  alignment  between  the  survey  and  administrative  measures,  the  administrative
9:259:20089:20:20:71:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure misses most of the separations that the survey respondents label as due todistress.  Specif-
9:260:20189:20:21:71:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ically, 28% of the worker survey-reporteddistressseparations are captured by the administrative
9:261:20284:21:20:71:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:indicator  such  that  the  administrative  indicator  misses  over  70%  of  the  survey-reporteddistress
9:262:20390:20:20:71:132:417:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:separations.5
9:263:20403:20:21:88:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B of Table 1 shows the misalignment in the other direction.  Almost half of the separations
9:264:20500:21:20:71:539:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that are labelled as an administrative displacement are labelled by workers as not due todistress.
9:265:20598:20:20:72:539:356:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:Among the administrative displacements, 55% of SIPP respondents report a job loss due todistress.6
9:266:20696:20:21:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus,  the  majority  of  the  separations  that  the  administrative  measure  labels  as  a  displacement
9:267:20803:21:20:71:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correspond to a worker report of displacement, which confirms the finding reported in Davis and
9:268:20898:20:20:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:von Wachter (2011, pg.  9 n.  9) that “most employment reductions are achieved through layoffs
9:269:20992:20:21:71:288:275:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:when firms contract by 30 percent or more.”7
9:270:21036:21:16:88:539:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now turn to graphical evidence on alignment between survey and administrative measures.
9:271:21126:16:14:87:539:238:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5Our results are close to von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012).  Conditional on a survey report of a
9:272:21234:14:11:72:540:224:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:displacement, they find substantial variation in alignment depending on the precise administrative definition used.
9:273:21349:11:11:72:540:213:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:For their preferred administrative definition (row 8), they find that a displacement shows up in the administrative
9:274:21464:11:11:72:540:202:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:data 23% of the time given it is present in the survey data, while we find it for 28% of separations.  Of course, if we
9:275:21583:11:7:72:539:191:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:focus attention on a narrow category ofdistress, “employer bankrupt or sold business,” then the alignment is tighter.
9:276:21700:7:15:87:539:184:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:6Conditional on the administrative indicator, we find many more survey reports of distress using the SIPP than
9:277:21810:15:11:72:540:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012) find using the DWS. In von Wachter, Handwerker, and Hildreth (2012,
9:278:21922:11:11:72:540:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Table 4, column (7)), conditional on the firm-side indicator showing distress, they find a report of a displacement in
9:279:22040:11:11:72:540:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the DWS at most 14% of the time (for various definitions of displacement).  This contrasts to 55% in our data.  The
9:280:22155:11:7:72:361:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:reason, we think, is that the DWS is notoriously plagued by recall bias.
9:281:22227:7:15:87:539:129:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7The Davis and von Wachter (2011) statistic is based on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS),
9:282:22334:15:11:72:539:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:which is an employer-side survey.  It is possible a firm reports laying a worker off, while a worker reports aquit, or
9:283:22452:11:32:72:187:103:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f6:otherreasons for separation.

10:285:22481:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 1 shows how separations depend on the employer growth rate.  In Panel A, the solid line
10:286:22575:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:plots the probability of a worker separating as a function of the employer growth rate, while the
10:287:22672:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:histogram  plots  the  distribution  of  the  employer  growth  rates.8The  histogram  shows  that  for
10:288:22775:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most observations in our data employers are relatively stable.  The solid line displays the canonical
10:289:22876:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hockey-stick shape (Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2012, Figure 6)) whereby the probability
10:290:22970:20:20:71:304:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of separating rises rapidly as employers contract.
10:291:23020:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B of Figure 1 shows the graphical version of the imperfect alignment between survey and
10:292:23113:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:administrative indicators of displacement.  The figure decomposes the probability of separating in
10:293:23211:20:20:71:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel A as a function of the employer growth rate into the three survey reasons:distress,quitand
10:294:23307:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:other.  Looking at the left-hand side of the graph, we see that among firms contracting by 30% or
10:295:23404:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more there are many survey reports ofquitandotheras the reason for separation.  Moreover, as
10:296:23496:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employers contract, the probabilities of each survey reason rises.  Looking at the right-hand side,
10:297:23595:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is still a positive probability of worker’s reporting distress as the reason for separation, even
10:298:23698:21:36:72:367:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though the administrative data approach would suggest none.
10:299:23757:36:27:72:260:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.4    Robustness and extensions
10:300:23789:27:21:72:441:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2 reports a variety of robustness and extension to our main definitions.
10:301:23867:21:20:88:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  first  consider  varying  our  definition  of  mass  layoff  along  the  dimensions  of  severity  and
10:302:23973:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:timing.  As can be anticipated from Panel B of Figure 1, when we increase the severity to a 40%
10:303:24068:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contraction, we find slightly tighter alignment;  when we decrease to a 5% contraction, we find a
10:304:24165:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weaker relationship.  We also vary the timing.  In our benchmark we use the growth rate computed
10:305:24261:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over 4 quarters relative to the separation (fromt−3 tot+ 1).  We experiment with varying this to
10:306:24357:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:8 quarters and 16 quarters and find, perhaps unsurprisingly, that alignment is much weaker when
10:307:24452:20:21:72:336:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we use a wider time period to measure the contraction.
10:308:24506:21:20:88:539:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then consider one of the alternative indicators of a displacement discussed in Appendix C:
10:309:24599:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unemployment  insurance  (UI)  take-up.   UI  take-up  is  potentially  a  cleaner  indicator  of  a  layoff
10:310:24707:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because there is a legal sense in which the UI system ensures that the worker was laid off, rather
10:311:24805:21:16:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than fired or quit.  Using a survey-based measure of UI take-up is still potentially problematic.  As
10:312:24906:16:14:87:539:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:8Looking at Table 1, the quarterly separation rate is about 3.0%.  This might appear low.  Several features of
10:313:25016:14:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:our sample account for this fact.  First,  the SIPP respondents considered in this paper have relatively stable jobs
10:314:25132:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:because we condition on having a year of tenure.  Second, the frequency of the table is quarterly.  The implied annual
10:315:25250:11:33:72:191:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:separation rate is about 12%.
10:316:25279:33:0:303:308:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:8
11:317:25280:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan (2009, Table 8) show, there is substantial underreporting of UI receipts in
11:318:25380:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the SIPP.9We find that, conditional on reporting collecting UI, 66% of workers report separating
11:319:25476:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because  of  distress,  while  11%  of  workers  who  do  not  collect  UI  report  separating  because  of
11:320:25583:20:21:72:118:648:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:distress.10
11:321:25594:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also use the information in the SIPP on severance pay to help validate and interpret the
11:322:25685:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey responses.  We find that, conditional on receiving severance pay, it is extremely unlikely that
11:323:25787:20:44:72:185:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a worker reports a quit.

11:325:25855:31:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The prior section shows that survey and administrative indicators of displacement are imperfectly
11:326:25952:20:21:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aligned.  This section shows that the consequences of the separation depend on both the adminis-
11:327:26048:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trative and survey classifications.  In section 4 we look in more detail at the interaction between
11:328:26147:20:36:72:158:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the classifications.

11:332:26396:20:20:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) to study the effect of displacements.  We also use it to study earnings
11:333:26496:20:21:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes following any separation.  This comparison allows us to difference out earnings gains (or
11:334:26593:21:20:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:losses) that would have happened in the absence in the separation.  For notational simplicity, we
11:335:26690:20:20:72:368:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:refer to displaced workers as the treated group in this section.

11:338:26944:20:17:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and were employed at a firm that was relatively stable (i.e., did not growth or shrink).  Following
11:339:27043:17:14:87:539:208:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:9The SIPP misses, on average, about 25% of the dollar value of SIPP receipts.  Obviously, for our purposes it
11:340:27152:14:7:72:451:194:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:would be ideal to be able to decompose this separately on the intensive and extensive margin.
11:341:27245:7:15:83:539:187:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10These  numbers  are  not  interpretable  as  take-up  rates,  but  the  fact  that  take-up  rates  for  UI  are  typically
11:342:27370:15:11:72:540:172:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:low  suggests  substantial  room  for  “misalignment.”   Anderson  and  Meyer  (1997,  pg.   925,  Table  3,  column  3)  use
11:343:27495:11:11:72:540:161:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:administrative data and find that the UI take-up rate among those displaced (using a 5% contraction definition) is
11:344:27609:11:79:72:468:150:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:53%, and Cullen and Gruber (2000, pg.  555-556) use the SIPP and find a UI take-up rate of 56%.

12:377:29025:41:20:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Relative to equation (1), this specification imposes three restrictions.  First, the effect of displace-
12:378:29129:20:21:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment on earnings does not vary across displacement quarters so thatδyk=δk.  Second, the slope
12:379:29222:21:20:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the path of the earnings of the control group is constant across displacement quarters, up to a
12:380:29320:20:0:72:345:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level shift.  That is, rather than enteringγytwe enterγt+

12:388:29511:16:11:83:392:226:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:11This is a true normalization because we include a full set of worker effects.
12:389:29590:11:15:83:539:215:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12This interpretation contrasts to the notion of displacement in Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993, pg.  691):
12:390:29704:15:11:72:539:200:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:“Our definition of earnings loss is the change in expected earnings if, several periods prior to dates, it was revealed
12:391:29823:11:11:72:540:189:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that the worker would be displaced at datesrather than being able to keep his or her job indefinitely.” See Krolikowski
12:392:29942:11:7:72:273:178:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(Forthcoming) for further discussion of this point.
12:393:29993:7:15:83:539:171:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:13In appendix Table A4 we present a stylized example of how a single person’s earnings history turns into several
12:394:30106:15:7:72:248:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:potential earnings records in our regression.
12:395:30151:7:15:83:539:149:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14Note that the person-displacement quarter fixed effects subsume the average of the time-varying error component
12:396:30264:15:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in the time that the worker is in the sample (e.g.  the average ofγt).  Hence, this specification implicitly allows there
12:397:30385:11:7:72:250:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:to be a time-specific component of earnings.
12:398:30429:7:45:83:392:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15This is a true normalization because we include a full set of worker effects.

13:400:30510:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not differ across displacement quarter so thatβy=β.16Appendix D discusses several issues with
13:401:30603:21:20:71:489:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:how to compute standard errors for this pooled specification and how we address them.
13:402:30688:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The sample described above includes the person-quarters in the SIPP that we successfully match
13:403:30782:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the LEHD. That match requires that we observe LEHD earnings in the current and previous
13:404:30872:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three quarters.  To study outcomes subsequent to displacement events, we need to include LEHD
13:405:30965:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings  for  subsequent  quarters.   As  is  standard  in  the  literature  (see  Table  A1),  we  initially
13:406:31075:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrict to the sample of people with positive earnings in a calendar year for up to four years after
13:407:31176:21:20:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the displacement.  We allow for less than four years when the LEHD data “runs out” (e.g., for a
13:408:31271:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separation in 2006,  we only require positive earnings in 2006,  2007,  and 2008).  We discuss this
13:409:31370:20:21:71:260:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample restriction in detail in section 5.
13:410:31412:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As  our  primary  earnings  variable,  we  normalize  earnings  using  the  average  of  2  quarters  of
13:411:31516:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers’  earnings  prior  to  displacement.   To  be  precise,  if  the  last  quarter  of  the  employment
13:412:31624:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relationship is periodt= 0, then we use the average earnings in periodst−1 andt−2.  Using
13:413:31713:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings normalized in this way combines the strengths of the levels and logs specification.  Like
13:414:31811:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the levels specification, it allows us to include quarters in which a worker had zero earnings.  Like
13:415:31912:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the logs specification, it generates coefficient estimates that are interpretable as percent change in
13:416:32014:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings relative to pre-displacement earnings.  In addition, like the log specification it weights each
13:417:32118:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:worker equally.  We are not the first to construct normalized earnings in this way; see, for example,
13:418:32219:20:36:72:335:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Autor et al. (2014) and Davis and von Wachter (2011).
13:419:32272:36:28:72:217:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.2    Comparison groups
13:420:32296:28:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In contrast to a common control group, in which all workers who continue in their jobs constitute
13:421:32393:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  control  group  (see  Krolikowski  (Forthcoming)  for  further  discussion),  our  control  group  in
13:422:32499:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equation (2) is workers who continue atrelatively  stablefirms (which we define as firm growth in
13:423:32596:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the growth interval [−5%,+5%]).17The language of treatment and control implies that we presume
13:424:32690:20:16:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the data approximates an experiment where some workers randomly separate.  An empirical
13:425:32782:16:15:83:539:182:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:16Note that iftis sufficiently bigger thanythen we do not include a calendar-quarter times displacement-quarter
13:426:32893:15:7:71:320:167:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:dummy since there are no earnings records associated with it.
13:427:32954:7:15:83:539:160:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17We use this group to minimize the extent to which there are negative or positive shocks in the control group,
13:428:33065:15:11:71:539:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:which might happen if we include continuers at firms that are contracting or expanding rapidly. The use of this control
13:429:33184:11:11:71:539:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:group also aligns with our approach in section 4 where we want a counterfactual where there was no shock (good
13:430:33294:11:11:71:539:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:or bad) at the firm.  We experimented with the control group of all workers who continue (regardless of employer
13:431:33406:11:11:71:539:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:growth)  and,  in  practice,  the  choice  of  the  control  group  had  little  effect  on  the  estimates.   We  use  the  employer
13:432:33539:11:30:71:503:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:growth screen for the control group as our baseline to maintain consistency with the approach in section 4.
13:433:33646:30:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:11
14:434:33648:0:21:72:525:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:implication of random separations is that the two groups look similar on observable covariates.
14:435:33743:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  3  shows  that  there  are  important  differences  in  observable  characteristics  between  our
14:436:33847:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:treatment  and  control  groups.   The  mass  layoff  separators  are  younger,  have  less  education,  are
14:437:33955:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to be men, and earn less.18They also work in smaller firms and in more blue-collar
14:438:34049:21:20:71:120:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industries.
14:439:34060:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To address this lack of covariate balance, we turn to propensity score reweighting.  The basic
14:440:34154:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:idea of propensity score reweighting is to make the control group “look like” the treatment group.
14:441:34252:21:36:71:246:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Complete details are in Appendix E.
14:442:34287:36:27:71:452:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.3    Displaced worker earnings losses:  weighted and unweighted
14:443:34352:27:21:71:539:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel A of Figure 2 shows that there are large earnings losses immediately after an administrative
14:444:34450:21:20:71:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displacement.  The figure plots the earnings trajectories of workers from 3 quarters before to 16
14:445:34547:20:20:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quarters  after  the  separation.   While  there  is  a  recovery,  even  three  to  four  years  after  the  dis-
14:446:34661:20:21:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:placement, earnings are still lower.  This persistence replicates the standard result in the literature.
14:447:34765:21:20:71:539:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The level of the long-term earnings losses are lower than in some classic studies such as Jacobson,
14:448:34864:20:20:71:539:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993).  We suspect that this difference is because we impose a lower tenure
14:449:34962:20:21:71:507:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:requirement (one year, as opposed to six years in Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993)).
14:450:35052:21:20:88:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B shows that our reweighting procedure makes little difference to the estimated earnings
14:451:35146:20:20:71:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trajectory.  Given the large differences in observable characteristics documented in Table 3 and the
14:452:35246:20:21:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fact that the reweighting procedure generates balance (see column (2)),  this finding might seem
14:453:35342:21:20:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:surprising.  It should not be surprising for a combination of three reasons.  First, we have already
14:454:35442:20:20:71:539:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:included worker fixed effects in the estimation,  so that level differences in earnings predicted by
14:455:35542:20:20:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these  characteristics  are  removed.   Second,  we  include  a  quartic  polynomial  in  age  so  that  age
14:456:35650:20:21:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:differences between the two groups—the primary predictor of curvature in earnings—is controlled

14:460:35975:16:15:83:539:162:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:18The earnings deciles are calculated by taking the average of earnings 2 and 3 quarters prior to the separation
14:461:36087:15:11:72:540:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:for the separators, and for the 2 and 3 quarters prior to the observation of continuing for the continuers.  For workers
14:462:36207:11:11:72:540:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:who continue—and thus possibly appear many times in the data—we only take one earnings record to calculate the
14:463:36317:11:7:72:158:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:earnings distribution.
14:464:36339:7:15:83:539:118:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:19In appendix Figure A3 we show the weighted and unweighted mean earnings trajectory in the control group.

15:467:36567:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For the remainder of the results in the paper, we find that there are differences in observable
15:468:36662:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristics  between  our  “treatment”  and  “control”  groups,  but  that  reweighting  makes  no
15:469:36764:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference to our estimates.  Hence, we present the reweighted results and do not discuss differences

15:471:36909:37:27:72:449:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.4    Decomposing the administrative measure by survey reason
15:472:36971:27:20:72:540:584:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Among those identified as displaced by the administrative indicator, there is significant heterogene-
15:473:37072:20:21:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ity in the earnings changes based on the survey reason.  Figure 3 plots the earnings changes for the
15:474:37172:21:20:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:administratively indicated displaced workers (as in Figure 2), but split into the three survey cate-
15:475:37272:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gories.  Mechanically, the lines in this figure come from estimating three separate regressions of the
15:476:37374:20:21:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:form given in equation (2).  Those reporting adistressreason for separation experience large initial
15:477:37474:21:20:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drops in earnings and then a gradual recovery.  Indeed, the recovery is slightly steeper among the
15:478:37572:20:20:72:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:surveydistressin an administrative displacement than in the administrative displacement overall.
15:479:37668:20:21:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The earnings trajectory of theotherseparations are similar to thedistress, except that the earn-
15:480:37764:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ings recovery fades out more than three years past the separation.  Such substantial earnings losses
15:481:37864:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for this group should not come as a surprise given the fact that many of the survey reports (i.e.,
15:482:37962:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:retirement, other family obligations, etc.)  have implications for subsequent labor market status.  In
15:483:38064:21:20:72:526:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contrast, those reporting aquitexperience modest earningsgainsrelative to the control group.
15:484:38156:20:20:88:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This heterogeneity in earnings losses across survey reasons provides evidence that noise in the
15:485:38251:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey  responses  does  not  explain  why  the  administrative  and  survey  measures  of  displacement
15:486:38355:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are imperfectly aligned.  Specifically, that thequitsdo much better than the remaining two survey
15:487:38452:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reasons is consistent with these workers having a very different experience of the mass layoff.  The
15:488:38552:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:next section takes up the question of how to interpret this heterogeneity in earnings changes by
15:489:38648:20:44:72:139:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey report.
15:490:38662:44:31:72:457:195:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:4    Recovering earnings losses of a latent displacement
15:491:38718:31:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section we develop and implement a method to measure the earnings losses of the separations
15:492:38817:20:21:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that are caused by the employer contraction.  To do so, we combine the information in Section 2
15:493:38912:21:19:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 3.  Section 2 showed that the survey data and administrative data do not always agree on the
15:494:39008:19:32:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:growth, reweighting the control group increases the rate of earnings growth, though this effect is quantitatively small.
15:495:39128:32:0:300:311:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:13
16:496:39130:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reason  for  separation.   Section  3  showed  that  the  consequences  of  an  administratively  indicated
16:497:39237:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mass layoff differ depending on the worker survey report.  Now we use these differences to measure
16:498:39335:20:20:72:176:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:latent earnings losses.
16:499:39358:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our approach uses the survey data to help interpret the administrative indicator of displace-
16:500:39451:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment.   Hence,  we  treat  the  administrative  and  survey  reports  asymmetrically.   An  alternative
16:501:39554:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approach would treat administrative and survey measures symmetrically, view them both as noisy
16:502:39648:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures of the same underlying phenomenon, and use one as an instrument for the other.  These
16:503:39742:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two  approaches  answer  different  questions.   Using  the  survey  measure  as  an  instrument  for  the
16:504:39848:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:administrative measure answers the question, “what are the effects of separations that survey and
16:505:39945:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:administrative data agree are due to firm distress?”  Our approach answers the question, “what are
16:506:40043:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the effects of the separations that are caused by the firm contracting, and how does that differ by
16:507:40142:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey reason?”  The reason we pursue our approach is that the administrative data approach is
16:508:40236:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the benchmark in the literature, so we seek to supplement it with information in the survey data.
16:509:40333:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Moreover, our approach provides a natural way of combining the descriptive results in the previous
16:510:40431:20:36:72:133:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two sections.
16:511:40444:36:28:72:158:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.1    Overview
16:512:40459:28:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel  B  of  Figure  1  plots  the  probability  of  reporting  each  kind  of  separation  as  a  function  of
16:513:40571:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employer  growth  rates.   It  shows  that  the  probability  of  reporting  all  kinds  of  separations  rises
16:514:40682:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rapidly as the employer contracts.  If we assume that the underlying propensities of individuals to
16:515:40781:21:20:72:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separate for a particular reason is independent of the firm growth rates, then the fact that thequit,
16:516:40882:20:20:71:539:279:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:distressandotherprobabilities rise as the firm contracts suggests that many of these separations
16:517:40978:20:20:71:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are caused by the firm contraction.  The next section formalizes this logic and shows how to use this
16:518:41079:20:21:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumption to also learn about the earnings changes caused by the employer contraction.  Sorkin
16:519:41174:21:20:71:539:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2018) uses similar reasoning to probabilistically distinguish between separations that are and are
16:520:41273:20:36:71:443:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not caused by an employer contraction, but does not incorporate survey data.
16:521:41349:36:28:71:517:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.2    Methodology for identifying latent displacements and its consequences
16:522:41425:28:20:71:539:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We are interested in estimating the effects of a separation in a mass layoff that is due to economic
16:523:41525:20:42:71:540:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distress,  which  we  call  alatent  displacementand  denote  by  ML∗.   ML∗differs  from  separations

17:525:41629:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed in mass layoff (or ML) in that it only contains the separations that are caused by the
17:526:41724:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employer contraction, and not merely coincident with it.  We allow the possibility that separations

17:529:42018:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In a slight abuse of notation, we will use MLsand ML∗sto refer to separations in an observed mass

17:545:42730:20:20:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion might differ from the benchmark results.  First, the shares might differ.  For example, it might
17:546:42831:20:21:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be that the benchmark approach overstates the share of quits that are caused by the contraction
17:547:42926:21:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  so  leads  to  an  underestimate  of  earnings  losses.   Second,  the  earnings  changes  might  differ.
17:548:43036:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For example, it might be that quits that are caused by the mass layoff have very different earnings
17:549:43135:20:21:72:351:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes than the quits that would have happened anyway.
17:550:43190:21:20:88:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To estimate theE[∆earnk|ML∗s= 1], consider the following pointwise relationship (i.e., for all

18:560:43901:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes given a mass layoff and a survey response are a mix of workers who separate because of

18:571:44434:20:21:72:208:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than survey reports of quits.

18:579:45002:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would have happened in the absence of the firm-level contraction by looking at the earnings losses

19:604:45934:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As an example of the calculation in equation (5), suppose that the average quit leads to a gain

19:606:46127:20:21:71:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f9:are excess quits.  Then we infer that these extra quits had a gain of $0, since 0.5×10 + 0.5×0 = $5,

19:612:46547:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large contractions than when they are relatively stable.  Rows (1) and (2) of Table 4 contain the

19:614:46750:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  separations  are  caused  by  the  employer  contraction  using  equation  (7),  row  (3)  of  Table  4
19:615:46858:20:21:72:539:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that thedistressseparations have a much stronger causal connection to firm growth than
19:616:46950:21:20:71:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thequitandotherseparations.  Specifically, 96% of thedistressseparations are caused by the firm
19:617:47045:20:20:72:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contraction, while only 77% of theotherseparations and 67% of thequitseparations are caused
19:618:47136:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the firm contraction.  This finding is consistent with the intuition that even at relatively stable
19:619:47238:21:20:72:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:firms, workers are likely to be quitting (or separating for other reasons), and so many of thesequits
19:620:47339:20:20:72:323:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:andotherseparations would have happened anyway.
19:621:47386:20:20:88:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These different probabilities by survey reason alter the weights placed on different categories

19:623:47575:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rows of Table 4 show the shares used in equations (3) and (4) to aggregate the earnings changes
19:624:47670:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by category.  As can be anticipated from the different probabilities, this procedure means that we
19:625:47768:20:21:72:527:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:place more weight on thedistressseparation and less weight on thequitandotherseparations.
19:626:47857:21:16:88:539:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It  is  helpful  to  contrast  our  approach  to  an  approach  that  would  take  the  survey  data  at

19:628:48072:14:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:definition of a mass layoff is that the firm is contracting by 30% or more, some readers might wonder how to reconcile
19:629:48190:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:these two facts.  The reconciliation lies in the fact that the workers in our sample are the higher-tenure subset of the
19:630:48310:11:33:72:155:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:workers at the firms.

20:633:48432:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where  the  survey  and  administrative  data  agree  as  a  latent  displacement,  then  from  row  (1)  of
20:634:48540:20:20:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  4,  we  would  conclude  that  only0.0550.055+0.021+0.026=  54%  of  separations  in  the  mass  layoff
20:635:48650:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are  latent  displacements.   Instead,  our  approach  allows  thequitandothersurvey  responses  to
20:636:48749:21:16:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also  be  latent  displacements  and,  combining  information  in  row  (1)  and  row  (3),  we  find  that

20:645:49361:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the earnings changes of workers separating in administratively-indicated displacement where the
20:646:49456:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey reason is alsodistress. The blue line reports the earnings changes where in the administrative
20:647:49557:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data the firm is relatively stable, but the worker’s survey reason isdistress.  Significantly, workers
20:648:49659:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reportingdistresshave better post-displacement earnings outcomes during a mass layoff than when
20:649:49754:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the firm is relatively stable.  This finding supports the adverse selection logic of Gibbons and Katz
20:650:49855:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1991) that workers who perceive distress as the reason for the separation do better when there are
20:651:49954:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many workers leaving the firm and there is less scope for selection.  The black solid line combines

20:654:50253:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is that we estimate that 96% of the survey-reporteddistressseparations in a mass layoff are caused
20:655:50351:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the firm contraction and so the latent earnings loss places almost all weight on the ML earnings

20:661:50848:16:49:83:513:121:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:22There is rounding that explains the difference from the 85% one gets if one does the calculation directly.

21:665:51162:20:20:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in mass layoffs directly (MLquit).  The reason is that the earnings gains to quits when the firm is
21:666:51261:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively  stable  are  much  bigger  than  the  earnings  gains  to  quits  when  the  firm  is  contracting.
21:667:51372:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Since we estimate that about a third of thequitsin the mass layoff are reaping these larger gains,
21:668:51470:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the quits caused by the mass layoff must have worse outcomes.  Nevertheless, the difference between

21:680:52564:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2.  The earnings losses from the simple administrative-based measure are remarkably close to the
21:681:52660:20:21:71:381:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings losses of the separations caused by the firm contraction.
21:682:52726:21:20:88:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why are the observed earnings losses in a mass layoff (ML) so similar to the latent earnings
21:683:52818:20:20:71:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:losses (ML∗)?  Two surprising features of the data drive this result.  First,  the sharp rise in the
21:684:52918:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of all the survey reasons as employment declines in Figure 1 means that there is a large
21:685:53018:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference between proximate reasons reported by workers at contracting firms and the ultimate
21:686:53112:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reason for their separation.  As a result, the weights in equation (8) are quite high and so the first
21:687:53214:20:21:71:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:condition necessary for ML and ML∗to differ is also not found in the data (πsis close to 1).  Second,
21:688:53315:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditional on the survey reason, what is going on at the firm—whether it is contracting by a lot,
21:689:53413:20:20:72:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or  is  relatively  stable—does  not  have  a  large  effect  on  earnings  losses:  (E[∆earnk|MLs]  is  close
21:690:53523:20:21:72:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:toE[∆earnk|RSs]).  This means that the second condition necessary for the latent and observed
21:691:53616:21:20:71:344:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures to differ emphasized in equation (8) is not met.
21:692:53673:20:47:88:539:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  summary,  the  standard  practice  of  using  observed  ML  for  overall  earnings  losses  is  not
21:693:53776:47:0:300:311:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:19
22:694:53778:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:misleading,  which  is  reassuring  for  the  literature.   Nonetheless,  knowledge  of  the  worker  reason
22:695:53886:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:does contain important information about the consequences of the separation for workers’ future
22:696:53981:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor market outcomes.  In terms of earnings losses, we uncover substantial heterogeneity depending
22:697:54080:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on survey responses and the administrative data categories.  Yet, conditional on the survey reason
22:698:54178:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  separation,  the  differences  in  earnings  loss  estimates  between  firms  that  are  contracting  and
22:699:54288:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:firms that are stable are small.  This results in an estimate of the latent earnings losses of displaced
22:700:54392:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers that is quite similar to the estimate using administrative data alone.  Hence, although we
22:701:54490:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:find evidence of sources of potential bias, they are quantitatively small and, to an extent, cancel
22:702:54589:20:36:72:91:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:out.
22:703:54593:36:28:72:388:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.5    Implications for the cyclicality of earnings losses
22:704:54651:28:20:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Using administrative data, Davis and von Wachter (2011) emphasize the cyclicality of the earnings
22:705:54748:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:losses of displaced workers:  workers displaced in recessions experience larger earnings losses than
22:706:54848:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers  displaced  in  booms.   Our  framework  highlights  one  mechanism  that  contributes  to  this
22:707:54952:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:finding.  In a recession, the administrative displacements, ML, are more likely to be latent displace-
22:708:55054:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ments, ML∗.  Mechanically, the reason is that in recessions labor markets are worse and so workers
22:709:55152:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are less likely to be able to find jobs in anticipation of a displacement and so less likely to have a
22:710:55254:21:20:72:376:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey report of quit, which is associated with better outcomes.
22:711:55318:20:20:88:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To document evidence of this, we extend our previous analysis and link the 2008 SIPP panel to
22:712:55411:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the LEHD. This allows us to contrast the relationship between survey and administrative reports in
22:713:55509:21:20:72:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 2000s and in the Great Recession.23The bottom panel of Table 2 shows that in the recession,
22:714:55604:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the alignment between the survey and administrative measures is tighter than in our benchmark
22:715:55697:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates.  The bottom panel of Table 4 shows that the “distress” separations make up a greater
22:716:55792:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:share of the latent mass layoff separations in the recession than in our benchmark estimates.  This
22:717:55891:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence is consistent with Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2012) in that in a recession, fewer
22:718:55988:20:20:72:382:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the separations when firms contract are survey-reported quits.
22:719:56053:20:21:88:539:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To  ask  about  the  quantitative  importance  of  this  mechanism,  we  apply  the  Great  Recession
22:720:56154:21:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weights to our estimates.  The reason we just change the weights is that conceptually, many things
22:721:56252:20:17:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change in a recession (i.e., the consequences of each type of separation), and we want to focus on the
22:722:56354:17:14:83:539:120:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:23We have separations from 2008:II to 2010:II, since the version of the LEHD we have access to ends in 2011:II
22:723:56464:14:34:72:415:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and we need several quarters of records to verify that a separation actually occurred.
22:724:56550:34:0:300:311:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:20
23:725:56552:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes in earnings losses that are due solely to the changing composition.24Hence, mechanically,
23:726:56649:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we take weights from the bottom panel of Table 4, and apply them to the earnings losses displayed
23:727:56746:20:20:72:270:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Figure 4.  Figure 6 displays the results.
23:728:56790:20:21:88:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Aggregating,  we  find  that  in  our  data  and  sample  period  the  changing  composition  of  job
23:729:56891:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separations in administratively measured displacements can account for very little of the cyclicality
23:730:56992:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:of earnings losses.  Why is this?  While Panel B of Table 4 shows that the weight shifts fromquit
23:731:57089:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:todistress,  which  generates  larger  earnings  losses,  the  weight  also  shifts  fromothertodistress,
23:732:57194:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which generates smaller earnings losses.  This of course leaves plenty of room for complementary
23:733:57290:20:43:72:296:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explanations, such as that in Huckfeldt (2016).

23:735:57378:32:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Having used survey data to sort out the reasons for separations, we now turn to using the survey
23:736:57474:20:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data  to  understand  the  labor  market  outcomes  subsequent  to  the  separation.   As  it  turns  out,
23:737:57580:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the information in survey data about these labor market outcomes makes a striking difference for
23:738:57676:20:37:72:379:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:understanding labor market outcomes after a true displacement.
23:739:57738:37:27:72:368:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5.1    Zeros:  unemployed or out of the labor force?
23:740:57790:27:20:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A common practice in estimating displaced worker earnings losses is to exclude earnings histories
23:741:57887:20:21:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when a worker exhibits long spells of zero earnings following the separation (see Table A1).  The
23:742:57984:21:20:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reason is that in administrative data, it is hard to know whether the zero earnings represent periods
23:743:58085:20:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  being  out  of  the  labor  force,  or  periods  of  looking  for  work.   If  we  could  distinguish  between
23:744:58199:20:21:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these  reasons,  however,  we  might  want  to  include  the  zero  earnings  associated  with  looking  for
23:745:58307:21:20:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:work because these losses represent an extreme reduction in hours following the displacement.  In
23:746:58404:20:20:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contrast,  we  might  not  want  to  include  zeros  associated  with  the  being  out  of  the  labor  force
23:747:58513:20:21:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because this state is fundamentally different.  So far in this paper we have followed the standard
23:748:58611:21:20:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:practice of omitting all earnings histories with a calendar-year of zeros in the four years following
23:749:58712:20:20:72:143:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the separation.
23:750:58727:20:16:88:539:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our link with survey data provides information on whether the zero earning histories that we
23:751:58819:16:15:83:539:128:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:24As discussed in footnote 23, we also do not have a long enough span of data to estimate earnings losses in the
23:752:58931:15:41:72:139:113:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Great Recession.

24:755:59048:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  work.   We  study  the  set  of  workers  who  have  at  least  one  calendar  year  of  zeros  following
24:756:59158:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displacement (this is the earnings filter used by Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) and Couch
24:757:59256:20:21:72:310:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Placzek (2010), among others; see Table A1).
24:758:59304:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel A of Table 5 shows that over 40% of separators have zero earnings in a calendar year
24:759:59394:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:following the separations and are thus omitted from the analysis of earnings losses in Section 3.1.
24:760:59493:20:21:72:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Most— 70% — of the separations that our zeros screen eliminates reportedotheras the survey
24:761:59583:21:20:72:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reason for separation.  This finding is intuitive since theothercategory contains many reasons for
24:762:59681:20:20:72:352:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separation that are correlated with leaving the labor force.
24:763:59741:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel  B  of  Table  5  looks  at  the  activities  of  the  workers  in  Panel  A  in  the  calendar-year  in
24:764:59851:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which  they  have  zero  earnings.   We  report  all  activities  that  the  worker  reports  in  the  SIPP  in
24:765:59962:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that calendar-year, and so some workers report multiple activities.  The Table shows that workers
24:766:60059:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reporting firmdistressare more likely to remain in the labor force than workers who lose their jobs
24:767:60158:21:20:72:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for other reasons.  40 percent of separations citing firmdistressreport looking for work, while this
24:768:60258:20:20:72:297:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:share is only 6 percent for the other categories.
24:769:60307:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel C of Table 5 demonstrates that these survey responses predict different subsequent labor
24:770:60401:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market outcomes.  We aggregate the activities in Panel B across the survey reasons for separation.
24:771:60499:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the spirit of Flinn and Heckman (1983), we consider whether workers reporting their activity as
24:772:60597:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“looking for work” (which most closely corresponds to the CPS notion of unemployed) are more
24:773:60689:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely  to  subsequently  find  a  job  than  workers  reporting  the  other  categories  of  activities.   The
24:774:60800:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bottom  panel  of  Table  5  reports  the  probability  of  having  positive  earnings  at  any  point  in  the
24:775:60911:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:next eight quarters as a function of the activities reported by the workers.  Consistent with the
24:776:61008:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:informative nature of the survey responses, the highest probability of nonzero earnings is among
24:777:61104:20:36:72:332:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers reporting “looking for work” and “employed.”

25:788:61801:21:29:99:282:618:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classified as unemployed (some zeros).

25:790:61944:20:21:71:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are large differences in earnings losses depending on the two treatments of zeros that are available
25:791:62044:21:20:71:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to  researchers  using  only  administrative  data.   Theno  zerosline  shows  the  standard  treatment
25:792:62147:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of zeros.  Theall  zerosline includes “all” zeros; i.e., it includes workers who are out of the labor
25:793:62248:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:force  and  unemployed.   The  difference  between  these  two  lines  is  about  15  percentage  points  of
25:794:62356:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pre-displacement earnings.  Typical analysis of displaced worker earnings losses would stop there
25:795:62453:20:20:72:442:467:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:and leave it to the reader to make up their minds which line they preferred.25
25:796:62531:20:21:88:539:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our use of survey data allows us to add back in only the earnings histories of workers who stay
25:797:62626:21:20:71:539:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the labor force following the displacement.  The red dashed line in Panel A of Figure 7 shows
25:798:62722:20:20:71:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that doing this—thesome zerosline—results in earnings losses that are about halfway between the
25:799:62817:20:21:71:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two extreme treatments of zeros.  That is, many displaced workers continue to look for work but
25:800:62912:21:20:71:539:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have significant spells of no earnings following their separation.  Relative to the typical treatment
25:801:63013:20:20:71:535:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of dropping the zeros, adding in these zeros approximately doubles the long-term earnings losses.
25:802:63110:20:21:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panels B to D in Figure 7 show that these workers who are unemployed following the displace-
25:803:63202:21:20:71:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ment are exclusively those who reportdistress.  In Panel B, which focuses on workers who report
25:804:63297:20:20:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:distress, almost all of the workers with zeros are unemployed and so thesome  zerosline is close
25:805:63393:20:21:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to theall zerosline.  In contrast, for thequitandothersurvey reasons the workers with zeros are
25:806:63488:21:36:72:496:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:almost all out of the labor force, so thesome zerosline is very close to theno zerosline.

25:808:63612:27:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  5  shows  that  despite  these  being  quarters  withzeroadministrative  data  earnings,  many
25:809:63713:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers report being employed.  Among the quits 89% of workers report being employed, while this
25:810:63809:21:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number is only 30% among those who separated due to distress.  An obvious explanation is that,

25:812:64021:14:37:72:517:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:there are zero earnings.  The second filter drops all earnings histories in which there are ever quarters of zeros.

26:814:64138:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:while our administrative data covers a large majority of the workforce,  it is still possible for an
26:815:64238:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual to transition to a job not covered by the data.  In particular, more informal employment
26:816:64337:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arrangements such as working for a family member might not report to the UI system. Additionally,

26:818:64505:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 6 shows that working for government or family members is less common among workers
26:819:64593:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who separated due to distress than other separations.  The table investigates workers who report
26:820:64689:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:being employed in the survey, but for whom the administrative data records zero earnings.  Part-
26:821:64785:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time work is another kind of employment that might be less likely to be covered and/or reported to
26:822:64883:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the UI system.  We find substantial amounts of part-time work among the zeros (34 percent among
26:823:64978:20:21:72:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those citing firmdistress).  Finally, the table indicates that the survey reported earnings are low.
26:824:65078:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Conditional on positive earnings in the SIPP, the mean level of earnings is around $4500 a quarter

26:827:65233:31:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper studies why workers separate from their jobs and how the consequences of these sep-
26:828:65327:21:20:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arations depend on the reason.  Specifically, we look at workers who are labelled displaced using
26:829:65424:20:20:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the standard administrative data approach, and ask what these workers say about why they sepa-
26:830:65518:20:21:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rated.  Almost half of such workers report reasons other than firm distress, including a large share
26:831:65618:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(about 20%) who report quitting to take another job.  Similarly, at firms that administrative data
26:832:65716:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would indicate are doing fine, we find evidence that workers separate and give a survey reason of
26:833:65813:20:21:72:137:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displacement.
26:834:65826:21:20:88:539:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We also find that even given the administrative data indicator, there is significant heterogeneity
26:835:65924:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the consequences of the separations that depends on the survey reason.  For example, the workers
26:836:66023:20:21:72:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who reportquitin an administrative mass layoff experience earnings gains relative to the control
26:837:66119:21:20:72:188:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group of non-separators.
26:838:66143:20:20:88:539:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Surprisingly, this heterogeneity in earnings losses by survey reason, conditional on the admin-
26:839:66238:20:16:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:istrative data distress indicator, is larger than the heterogeneity in the other direction.  That is,
26:840:66339:16:15:83:539:151:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:26Even though we are looking at a sample of people who report employment in the survey, not all of them actually
26:841:66451:15:11:72:540:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:report positive earnings.  Indeed, among the problematic group of survey respondents who reporteddistressin the
26:842:66562:11:11:72:540:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:survey, have zero administrative earnings, and claim to be employed, only 55 percent actually report positive earnings
26:843:66680:11:43:72:126:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in the survey.
26:844:66694:43:0:300:311:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:24
27:845:66696:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditional on the survey reason, what is going on at the firm does not have a large impact on the
27:846:66794:21:20:72:207:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings changes of workers.
27:847:66822:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:What  the  administrative  indicator  does  do,  however,  is  shift  the  composition  of  separations.
27:848:66926:20:21:72:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Not surprisingly, survey reports ofdistressaccount for a much greater share of separations at the
27:849:67023:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mass layoff firms than at the relatively stable firms.  Even though the composition of separations
27:850:67121:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shifts, it is still the case that the probability of separating and reporting non-distress survey reasons
27:851:67226:20:21:71:295:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rise dramatically when the employer contracts.
27:852:67272:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We then develop a method to combine the information in the survey and administrative data and
27:853:67365:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure the consequences of the separations that were ultimately caused by the firm contraction.
27:854:67461:20:21:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  find  that  the  earnings  consequences  of  the  separations  ultimately  caused  by  the  employer
27:855:67565:21:20:71:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contraction  are  quite  similar  to  those  captured  by  the  standard  administrative  measure.   Two
27:856:67669:20:20:71:539:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intermediate  results drive  this  finding.   First,  because the  probability of  all  types  of  separations
27:857:67779:20:21:71:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rises dramatically, most of the separations in the administratively indicated mass layoff are caused
27:858:67879:21:20:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the mass layoff.  Second, the earnings changes associated with each survey report do not depend
27:859:67977:20:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that much on the state of the employer. Indeed, the result of our method is to increase the alignment
27:860:68078:20:21:71:536:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the administrative measure with survey displacement from 54% in the raw data to about 85%.
27:861:68171:21:20:88:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Additionally,  we use the combination of administrative and survey data to shed light on the
27:862:68263:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conceptually distinct issue of how to treat displaced workers with persistent zero earnings.  The
27:863:68360:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:standard practice in the displaced worker literature is to exclude observations with long stretches
27:864:68459:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of zero earnings.  Using the survey data, we can distinguish whether these zero earning individuals
27:865:68558:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were looking for work or not.  Including those who were looking for work approximately doubles
27:866:68652:20:21:71:388:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the estimate of long-term earnings losses following a displacement.
27:867:68719:21:20:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:More generally,  this paper has  demonstrated the usefulness  of combining administrative  and
27:868:68813:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey measures of the same outcome.  Administrative data are attractive because they provide
27:869:68906:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:precise measures of outcomes, often on very large samples.  The reason for the outcomes, however,
27:870:69003:21:20:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:must typically be inferred in the administrative data.  The linked survey data provide worker-level
27:871:69102:20:20:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information on the reason for the outcomes.  Our results show that the standard practice of using
27:872:69199:20:21:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a mass layoff indicator in administrative data leads to estimates of earnings losses very similar to
27:873:69299:21:67:71:493:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the approach proposed in this paper that combines survey and administrative measures.

47:1339:96429:13:14:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but make up a smaller share of the new employer, then this is more plausibly an acquisition/merger
47:1340:96527:14:13:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in which the new ID number swallowed the old ID number.  The only difference from Benedetto
47:1341:96618:13:14:71:539:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et  al.  (2007)  is  that  we  use  a  70%  threshold  rather  than  an  80%.   The  reason  to  do  this  is  to
47:1342:96731:14:13:71:539:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be more conservative.  It also aligns with Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) definition of a
47:1343:96828:13:14:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displacement more  tightly so that we know that the JLS mass layoffs  are never associated with
47:1344:96923:14:14:71:289:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large flows of workers to a common employer.
47:1345:96967:14:13:88:539:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:When we observe an ID change or a merger/acquisition we go back and change the ID so that
47:1346:97056:13:34:71:520:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we have a consistent ID series.  This correction allows us to compute employer-level outcomes.

47:1348:97204:25:13:71:539:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The literature and some government programs contain other ways of attempting to measure sepa-

47:1351:97352:20:14:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Some U.S. federal government programs use definitions of mass displacements.  These definitions
47:1352:97447:14:13:71:539:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are also displayed in Table A2.  In general, these definitions focus on the number of separations (e.g.
47:1353:97550:13:17:71:539:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:50 or more worker separations), rather than the change in employer size (e.g.  30% contraction) as
47:1354:97648:17:11:83:419:132:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:27Couch and Placzek (2010, Web appendix A) topcode at $155,000 in 2000 dollars.

47:1356:97833:15:34:72:484:106:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:employer IDS: they alter their definition of displacement to exclude all cases where the ID disappears.

48:1359:98034:14:14:72:540:695:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:academic research (e.g. Ananat et al. (2011)). The BLS Mass Layoff Program has been discontinued
48:1360:98130:14:13:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to budget cuts, which serves to reinforce the value of alternative measures of displacements in

48:1366:98571:14:13:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:UI  collection  as  a  measure  of  displacement:  Jacobson,  Lalonde,  and  Sullivan  (2005)  and  Hilger
48:1367:98677:13:14:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2016),  which uses state UI records and tax records respectively.  The goal of this measurement
48:1368:98773:14:13:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is to isolate separations that are not due to workers being fired for cause.  A disadvantage of this
48:1369:98873:13:14:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approach, however, is that it conditions on future outcomes since it selects those workers who do
48:1370:98970:14:29:72:197:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not find jobs immediately.

48:1372:99016:21:13:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A final alternative measure worth noting is one based on what the media covers as mass layoffs.
48:1373:99111:13:14:72:539:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hallock (1998) is an outstanding example of this approach.29He looks at media reports of mass
48:1374:99204:14:13:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:layoffs at public companies from 1987 to 1995.30An interesting feature of this data is that these
48:1375:99301:13:14:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:layoffs are small compared to that reflected in economic studies. Chen et al. (2001, Table 3) replicate
48:1376:99404:14:13:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Hallock (1998) for 1990 to 1995 and report that the average share of the workforce involved in a
48:1377:99500:13:14:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:layoff identified in this matter is 8.74%, while the median is 4.55%.  One interpretation of this fact
48:1378:99602:14:13:72:540:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is that even though a large number of separations is required to attract media attention,  public
48:1379:99699:13:35:72:378:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:companies are large so this makes up a small share of their size.
48:1380:99764:35:24:72:296:344:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:D    Appendix:  Standard Errors
48:1381:99795:24:14:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are several issues concerning computing standard errors for the pooled specification in equa-
48:1382:99894:14:13:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion (2).  First, insofar as there is heterogeneity in the displaced worker earnings losses, then we
48:1383:99994:13:14:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expect there to be serial correlation in the standard errors at the individual level.  This concern
48:1384:100093:14:13:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arises even in specification (1).  We address this concern by clustering at the person level.  Second,
48:1385:100195:13:14:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a given person-quarter observation might appear several times.  For example, if a person continues
48:1386:100293:14:13:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  a  job  for  several  quarters  and  then  loses  their  job  in  a  mass  displacement,  then  a  particular
48:1387:100406:13:14:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calendar  quarter  of  earnings  would  show  up  in  two  different  calendar  times.   This  specification
48:1388:100514:14:14:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a given observation potentially appearing multiple times is formally identical to the preferred
48:1389:100614:14:13:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specification in Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), and we adopt their solution of clustering at the
48:1390:100711:13:15:72:454:198:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:level of aggregation at which a given observation might appear multiple times.31

49:1406:101627:24:14:72:540:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The basic idea of propensity score reweighting is to make the control group “look like” the treatment
49:1407:101728:14:13:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group.  That is, we are interested in estimating the average treatment on the treated (ATT). To
49:1408:101823:13:14:72:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:operationalize  this  reweighting,  we  estimate  a  propensity  score,  ˆp,  to  be  in  the  treated  group
49:1409:101932:14:9:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:including all of the covariates in Table 3.  We use a logit functional form.  We construct a weight,
49:1410:102032:9:8:79:82:573:8:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f11:ˆp
49:1411:102034:8:10:73:484:565:8:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:1−ˆp, to be in the control group.  We then re-estimate equation (2) using these weights.
49:1412:102122:10:14:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  literature  has  emphasized  three  implementation  issues  in  propensity  score  reweighting:
49:1413:102222:14:13:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:normalization, common support and “large weights.”  Busso, DiNardo, and McCrary (2014) em-
49:1414:102312:13:14:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:phasize in their finite-sample Monte Carlo results that it is important to normalize the weights.
49:1415:102409:14:13:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We normalize the weights so that the number of units in the control group is the same as before
49:1416:102504:13:14:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reweighting (i.e., the average weight is 1).  Common support refers to whether there is overlap in
49:1417:102602:14:13:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the propensity score distributions between the treatment and control groups.  Conceptually, if there
49:1418:102702:13:14:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is not overlap then the control group is very different from the treated group, and it is harder to
49:1419:102801:14:13:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imagine that these are randomly assigned.  For each comparison, we verify that there is common
49:1420:102895:13:14:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support.  Heuristically, this means that there are not (near) perfect predictors of being displaced.
49:1421:102995:14:14:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, a concern emphasized by Crump et al. (2014) is that for propensity scores close to 1, the
49:1422:103093:14:13:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weights blow-up and in the bias-variance tradeoff, a researcher is better off dropping some observa-
49:1423:103193:13:14:72:539:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tions.33In practice, the events that we study are relatively rare and so we do not have estimated
49:1424:103290:14:232:72:205:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:propensity scores close to 1.
49:1425:103319:232:15:83:539:160:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:32In our application,  we have over 30 clusters in the time dimension and over 30,000 dimensions in the person
49:1426:103429:15:7:72:115:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:dimension.
49:1427:103439:7:7:83:480:138:6:g_d0_f5:6:g_d0_f18:33They are interested in the average treatment effect (ATE), and so have weights that look likep

49:1431:103548:8:11:72:540:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:so they recommend trimming weights both at the top and the bottom.  We are interested in the average treatment on
49:1432:103661:11:11:72:539:112:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the treated (ATT) and so only have weights that look likep1−pand so their approach would only suggest trimming
