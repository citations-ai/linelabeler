2:25:1157:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:26:1165:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Using time-diary data from 25 countries, we demonstrate that there is a negative relationship between
2:27:1266:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:real GDP per capita and the female-male difference in total work time per day -- the sum of work for
2:28:1366:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:pay and work at home.  In rich northern countries on four continents, including the United States, there
2:29:1470:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:is no difference -- men and women do the same amount of total work.  This latter fact has been presented
2:30:1574:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:before by several sociologists for a few rich countries; but our survey results show that labor economists,
2:31:1681:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:macroeconomists, the general public and sociologists are unaware of it and instead believe that women
2:32:1782:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:perform more total work. The facts do not arise from gender differences in the price of time (as measured
2:33:1887:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:by market wages), as women's total work is further below men's where their relative wages are lower.
2:34:1987:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:Additional tests using U.S. and German data show that they do not arise from differences in marital
2:35:2086:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:bargaining, as gender equality is not associated with marital status; nor do they stem from family norms,
2:36:2191:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:since most of the variance in the gender total work difference is due to within-couple differences. We
2:37:2293:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:offer a theory of social norms to explain the facts.  The social-norm explanation is better able to account
2:38:2400:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:for within-education group and within-region gender differences in total work being smaller than inter-group
2:39:2508:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:differences. It is consistent with evidence using the World Values Surveys that female total work is
2:40:2608:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:relatively greater than men's where both men and women believe that scarce jobs should be offered
2:41:2705:14:28:72:130:378:12:Times:12:Times:to men first.

3:60:3040:0:29:90:180:706:195:Times:195:Times:1 Introduction 
3:61:3055:29:25:90:527:677:121:Times:121:Times:It  is  well-known  that  men  engage  in  more  market  work—have  higher  participation  rates  and  
3:62:3158:25:25:89:526:652:121:Times:121:Times:longer  workweeks  conditional  on  participation—than  women.    What  has  not  been  thoroughly  
3:63:3258:25:26:89:525:627:121:Times:121:Times:examined, and what has been untouched by economists, is the issue of gender differences in the 
3:64:3353:26:25:89:525:601:121:Times:121:Times:total  amount  of  work—in  the  market  and  at  home.    Despite  the  obvious  importance  of  looking  
3:65:3460:25:25:89:524:576:121:Times:121:Times:more closely at how people spend their non-work time, relatively little attention has been paid to 
3:66:3559:25:26:90:525:551:121:Times:121:Times:describing  its  patterns  and  examining  its  determinants.    A  few  studies  have  considered  how  the  
3:67:3669:26:25:89:524:525:121:Times:121:Times:price of time affects the distribution of non-work time (Kooreman and Kapteyn, 1987; Biddle and 
3:68:3765:25:25:89:525:500:121:Times:121:Times:Hamermesh, 1990); and Aguiar and Hurst (2007) have charted secular changes in the distribution 
3:69:3860:25:26:89:524:475:121:Times:121:Times:of non-market time in the United States.  Generally, however, this line of inquiry has been limited 
3:70:3960:26:25:89:527:449:121:Times:121:Times:by  the  relative  paucity  of  available  data  sets.    Until  recently  no  country  provided  data  on  a  
3:71:4071:25:25:89:526:424:121:Times:121:Times:continuing  basis  on  how  its  citizens  spend  their  time,  and  many  have  never  provided  such  
3:72:4175:25:25:89:525:399:121:Times:121:Times:information.    This  absence  of  data  has  begun  to  change,  and  that  change  is  what  enables  us  to  
3:73:4287:25:26:89:372:374:121:Times:121:Times:examine gender differences in the allocation of total work time. 
3:74:4352:26:25:126:527:348:121:Times:121:Times:We  believe  that  this  issue  is  important.    First,  because  the  amount  of  work  (and  its  
3:75:4453:25:25:89:524:323:121:Times:121:Times:obverse, the utility from leisure) is one of the crucial arguing points in the “gender wars,” simply 
3:76:4554:25:26:89:525:298:121:Times:121:Times:discovering new facts about it is important.  Second, discovering the determinants of those facts 
3:77:4652:26:25:89:525:272:121:Times:121:Times:will  allow  us  to  infer  how  patterns  of  work  by  gender  change  as  economies  develop.    Third,  by  
3:78:4764:25:25:89:526:247:121:Times:121:Times:developing  a  new  theory  of  gender  differences  in  the  amount  of  total  work,  we  may  be  able  to  
3:79:4875:25:26:89:526:222:121:Times:121:Times:provide  an  impetus  for  using  similar  theories  to  examine  other  differences  in  the  allocation  of  
3:80:4986:26:25:89:526:196:121:Times:121:Times:time.    Finally,  the  facts  we  adduce  and  the  theory  we  present  to  explain  them  can  impose  
3:81:5092:25:25:89:529:171:121:Times:121:Times:restrictions   on   a   variety   of   models   that   economists   have   developed,   including   some   in   
3:82:5204:25:25:89:334:146:121:Times:121:Times:macroeconomics/growth, and in household economics. 
3:83:5255:25:26:126:526:121:121:Times:121:Times:In  the  next  section  we  describe  what  we  mean  by  market  and  household  work,  outline  
3:84:5353:26:25:90:524:95:121:Times:121:Times:data sets for four Western countries and present some facts using those data sets.  We then expand 
3:85:5452:25:0:90:525:70:121:Times:121:Times:the comparisons to a large number of other data sets, so that in the end we are using data on the 
4:86:5550:0:25:90:524:709:121:Times:121:Times:gender breakdown of work at home and in the market in 25 countries.  Whether the facts that we 
4:87:5645:25:25:90:526:684:121:Times:121:Times:adduce  in  Section  2  are  novel,  and  whether  they  are  already  widely  known,  are  examined  in  
4:88:5751:25:26:90:526:659:121:Times:121:Times:Section  3.    In  Section  4  we  consider  some  possible  explanations  of  our  findings  and  indicate  
4:89:5860:26:25:90:524:633:121:Times:121:Times:which ones do not seem consistent with the results.  This leads in Section 5 to the development of 
4:90:5959:25:25:90:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:a  theory  based  on  social  norms  that  is  consistent  with  those  results.  Section  6  examines  some  
4:91:6069:25:25:90:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:additional evidence that appears consistent with the theory, while Section 7 outlines a number of 
4:92:6167:25:29:90:458:558:121:Times:121:Times:areas where the facts and theory should be used to inform how we model behavior. 
4:93:6248:29:29:90:473:529:195:Times:195:Times:2  Market Work, Home Work and Their Differences by Gender 
4:94:6306:29:25:90:525:500:121:Times:121:Times:In order to examine gender differences in work empirically, we need to devise general rules that 
4:95:6403:25:26:90:526:475:121:Times:121:Times:allow  activities  to  be  classified  as  work.    We  first  define  work  as  the  sum  of  time  spent  in  
4:96:6515:26:25:90:525:449:121:Times:121:Times:production in the market and the household.  We define market work as time spent for pay (or in 
4:97:6611:25:25:90:525:424:121:Times:121:Times:unpaid household production for the market).  We assume that people would not be working the 
4:98:6704:25:25:90:527:399:121:Times:121:Times:marginal  hour  in  the  market  if  they  were  not  paid,  so  that  at  the  margin  market  work  is  not  
4:99:6815:25:26:90:527:374:121:Times:121:Times:enjoyable  (or  at  least  is  less  enjoyable  than  any  non-work  activity  at  the  margin).    In  the  
4:100:6924:26:25:90:525:348:121:Times:121:Times:economics literature it has generally been treated as the obverse of the aggregate of all activities 
4:101:7025:25:25:90:485:323:121:Times:121:Times:outside the market—all uses of non-market time are implicitly assumed to be aggregable. 
4:102:7113:25:26:90:525:298:121:Times:121:Times: We count as household production those activities that satisfy the third-party rule (Reid, 
4:103:7204:26:25:90:525:272:121:Times:121:Times:1934) that substituting market goods and services for one’s own time is possible.  Such activities 
4:104:7303:25:25:90:526:247:121:Times:121:Times:may  be  enjoyable  (as  may  be  work  in  the  market),  even  at  the  margin;  but  they  still  have  the  
4:105:7415:25:26:90:525:222:121:Times:121:Times:common characteristic that we could pay somebody to perform them for us and we are not paid 
4:106:7507:26:25:90:527:196:121:Times:121:Times:for  performing  them.    We  define  total  work  as  the  sum  of  time  spent  in  market  work  and  
4:107:7612:25:25:90:527:171:121:Times:121:Times:household  production.    Note  that  we  do  not  and  cannot  examine  gender  differences  in  the  
4:108:7715:25:25:90:525:146:121:Times:121:Times:consumption value of the average or marginal minute of market or household production; all we 
4:109:7809:25:26:90:527:121:121:Times:121:Times:do  here  is  estimate,  and  then  try  to  explain,  differences  in  the  total  amount  of  time  spent  in  
4:110:7922:26:57:90:185:95:121:Times:121:Times:productive activities. 
4:111:7945:57:0:90:309:38:144:Times:144:Times: 2
5:112:7946:0:25:90:525:709:121:Times:121:Times:                One alternative to production is tertiary activities, those things that we cannot pay other 
5:113:8054:25:25:90:526:684:121:Times:121:Times:people  to  do  for  us  but  that  we  must  do  at  least  some  of.  Included  in  this  category  are  sleeping  
5:114:8171:25:26:90:527:659:121:Times:121:Times:and  eating,  and  other  biological  needs.    It  should  be  prima  facie  clear  from  this  distinction  
5:115:8281:26:25:90:524:633:121:Times:121:Times:between them and household production why it is important to disaggregate non-market time:  A 
5:116:8375:25:25:90:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:drop  in  non-market  time  because  people  are  contracting  out  more  activities  has  much  different  
5:117:8483:25:25:89:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:implications for their well-being than does a similar decline in tertiary activity.  The two types of 
5:118:8585:25:26:90:525:558:121:Times:121:Times:activities are imperfect substitutes, nor are they likely to be equally substitutable for market work 
5:119:8687:26:25:90:364:532:121:Times:121:Times:and thus allow the aggregation of these non-market activities. 
5:120:8750:25:25:90:524:507:121:Times:121:Times: The fourth and final aggregate is leisure, all activities that we cannot pay somebody else 
5:121:8840:25:26:89:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:to do for us and that we do not really have to do at all if we do not wish to.  We include in this 
5:122:8939:26:25:89:527:456:121:Times:121:Times:category  television-watching,  attending  religious  services,  reading  a  newspaper,  chatting  with  
5:123:9044:25:25:89:524:431:121:Times:121:Times:friends, etc.   What distinguish leisure from the other types of home activities are that it cannot be 
5:124:9147:25:26:89:528:406:121:Times:121:Times:outsourced  and  that  one  can  function  perfectly  well  (albeit  not  happily)  with  no  leisure  
5:125:9250:26:25:89:286:380:121:Times:121:Times:whatsoever:  None is necessary for survival. 
5:126:9295:25:25:125:525:355:121:Times:121:Times:Throughout  this  initial  empirical  section  we  try  to  define  the  aggregates  of  activities  as  
5:127:9400:25:25:89:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:similarly  as  possible  across  the  countries  we  study.    All  of  our  national  aggregates  are  based  
5:128:9511:25:26:89:526:305:121:Times:121:Times:either  on  our  own  aggregations  of  micro  data  collected  from  time  diaries  or  from  published  
5:129:9617:26:25:89:524:279:121:Times:121:Times:aggregates summarizing such data.  An increasing number of national governments have fielded 
5:130:9710:25:25:89:526:254:121:Times:121:Times:time-diary  surveys.    Wide-scale  surveys  have  been  conducted  for  nearly  70  years  (Sorokin  and  
5:131:9817:25:26:89:525:229:121:Times:121:Times:Berger, 1939).  The general idea in a time-diary study is to give each respondent a diary for one

5:133:10014:25:25:89:524:178:121:Times:121:Times:activity then underway and then indicate the time each new activity was undertaken and what that 
5:134:10111:25:26:89:525:153:121:Times:121:Times:activity was.  The respondent either works from a set of codes indicating specific activities, or the 
5:135:10213:26:25:89:425:127:121:Times:121:Times:survey team codes the descriptions into a pre-determined set of categories.   
5:136:10291:25:25:125:526:102:121:Times:121:Times:No  matter  how  extensive  a  set  of  codes  is,  each  survey  will  have  a  different  way  of  
5:137:10392:25:39:89:524:77:121:Times:121:Times:coding and aggregating what might seem like the same activity to an observer.  Time diaries have

6:139:10490:0:25:90:525:709:121:Times:121:Times:the virtue of forcing respondents to provide a time allocation that adds to 24 hours in a day. Also, 
6:140:10591:25:25:90:521:684:121:Times:121:Times:unlike retrospective data about last week’s or even last year’s time spent working, while the time-
6:141:10690:25:26:90:526:659:121:Times:121:Times:diary  information  is  necessarily  based  on  recall,  the  recall  period  is  only  one  day.    The  shorter  
6:142:10805:26:25:90:526:633:121:Times:121:Times:recall  period  and  the  implicit  time-budget  constraint  suggest  that  information  on  market  work  
6:143:10912:25:25:90:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:from  time  diaries  is  likely  to  be  more  reliable  than  the  recall  data  on  time  use  from  standard  
6:144:11025:25:25:90:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:household surveys; and, of course, time diaries provide information on non-market activities that 
6:145:11123:25:26:90:273:558:121:Times:121:Times:is unavailable from labor-force surveys.   
6:146:11166:26:25:126:525:532:121:Times:121:Times:We concentrate initially on recent time-diary data for four countries:  Germany, Italy, the 
6:147:11258:25:25:89:527:507:121:Times:121:Times:Netherlands  and  the  U.S.    (Details  on  these  four  data  sets  are  contained  in  Statistisches  
6:148:11363:25:26:89:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:Bundesamt, 1999; ISTAT, 2005; NIWI, 1993; and Hamermesh et al, 2005.)  The time diaries are 
6:149:11455:26:25:89:524:456:121:Times:121:Times:collected for a single day in the U.S., two or three days in Germany and Italy, and an entire week 
6:150:11554:25:25:89:525:431:121:Times:121:Times:in the Netherlands.  Table 1 presents the aggregates of time spent in various activities (with basic 
6:151:11655:25:26:89:527:406:121:Times:121:Times:activities  numbering  at  least  200  in  each  set  of  diaries)  by  gender  for  each  country  on  a  
6:152:11762:26:25:89:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:representative  day  of  the  week.    We  concentrate  on  individuals  aged  20-74,  the  largest  possible  
6:153:11873:25:25:89:293:355:121:Times:121:Times:age range that is included in all four data sets. 
6:154:11923:25:25:126:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:The  crucial  thing  to  note  from  this  table  is  the  near-equality  of  total  work  by  gender  
6:155:12026:25:26:89:525:305:121:Times:121:Times:within  Germany,  the  Netherlands  and  the  U.S.    There  are  substantial  differences  in  total  work  
6:156:12135:26:25:89:525:279:121:Times:121:Times:across these countries, perhaps real, perhaps due to inherently non-comparable classifications of 
6:157:12233:25:25:89:525:254:121:Times:121:Times:activities among them; but within each country, among people from the same culture and whose 
6:158:12326:25:26:89:527:229:121:Times:121:Times:activities  are  classified  using  the  same  basic  activities  and  methods  of  aggregation,  there  is  
6:159:12435:26:25:89:525:203:121:Times:121:Times:essentially no difference by gender in total work.  Men work more in the market, women engage 
6:160:12529:25:25:89:525:178:121:Times:121:Times:in more home production, but these balance out.1  The only exception is Italy, where men work 
6:161:12623:25:30:89:525:153:121:Times:121:Times:substantially  less  in  total  than  women,  mainly  because  women  engage  in  much  more  household  
6:162:12728:30:8:90:237:123:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:163:12776:8:16:126:525:115:42:Times:100:Times:1Aguiar and Hurst (2007) calculate what they call total market work plus non-market work using 
6:164:12871:16:11:89:526:99:100:Times:100:Times:the  same  U.S.  time-diary  survey.  When  one  accounts  for  childcare,  the  excess  of  male  total  work  over  
6:165:12989:11:12:90:526:88:100:Times:100:Times:female  total  work  reduces  to  1.1  hours  per  week  (9  minutes  per  day)  in  2003.    Thus  even  though  their  
6:166:13110:12:11:90:526:76:100:Times:100:Times:combination  of  the  basic  categories  could  not  be  the  same  as  ours,  the  inference  from  their  study  is  
6:167:13229:11:27:90:407:65:100:Times:100:Times:essentially identical to what we have found in the various data sets used here.   
6:168:13311:27:0:90:309:38:144:Times:144:Times: 4
7:169:13312:0:25:90:526:709:121:Times:121:Times:production  than  women  elsewhere,  while  men  engage  in  less.    Indeed,  nearly  two-thirds  of  the  
7:170:13420:25:25:89:527:684:121:Times:121:Times:excess  of  women’s  total  work  over  men’s  in  Italy  compared  to  the  other  three  countries  is  
7:171:13526:25:26:90:414:659:121:Times:49:Times:accounted for by the time they spend cleaning house (Burda et al, 2006).2
7:172:13599:26:25:90:524:633:121:Times:121:Times: Beyond this striking iso-work fact, the other consistent difference is the gender difference 
7:173:13691:25:25:89:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:in  non-work  activities:    Men  enjoy  more  leisure,  women  spend  more  time  in  tertiary  activities  
7:174:13800:25:25:89:524:583:121:Times:121:Times:(and, of course, in the countries other than Italy these sum to the same amount of time).  Nearly 
7:175:13898:25:26:89:526:558:121:Times:121:Times:all  of  men’s  excess  leisure  (again,  except  for  Italy)  is  accounted  for  by  their  additional  time  in  
7:176:14014:26:25:89:219:532:121:Times:121:Times:front of television screens.3   
7:177:14046:25:25:126:525:507:121:Times:121:Times:Given evidence that even sleep responds to monetary incentives, and (Hamermesh, 2007) 
7:178:14132:25:26:90:526:482:121:Times:121:Times:that time spent eating does too, nothing requires that the total amount of non-work time (and by 
7:179:14229:26:25:90:524:456:121:Times:121:Times:construction the total amount of work) be nearly identical among men and women, as it is in three 
7:180:14327:25:25:90:526:431:121:Times:121:Times:of  the  four  countries.    Whether  this  equality  is  more  widespread  can  be  inferred  by  comparing  
7:181:14437:25:26:90:526:406:121:Times:121:Times:calculations  using  published  aggregates  from  recent  time-diary  studies  from  seven  wealthy  EU  
7:182:14542:26:25:90:526:380:121:Times:121:Times:countries,  the  results  of  which  are  presented  in  Table  2.    With  the  exception  of  France,  where  
7:183:14654:25:25:90:525:355:121:Times:121:Times:women’s  total  work  exceeds  men’s  by  over  seven  percent,  we  again  find  near-equality  of  total  
7:184:14762:25:25:90:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:work  by  gender.    Again  too,  in  these  countries  more  of  men’s  non-work  time,  which  roughly  
7:185:14868:25:33:90:390:305:121:Times:121:Times:equals women’s, is spent more in leisure, less in tertiary activities.   
7:186:14941:33:7:90:237:272:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:187:14989:7:16:126:526:265:42:Times:100:Times:2This  exceptional  Italian  behavior  appears  to  be  well-recognized  in  popular  literature:    “Italian  
7:188:15100:16:12:90:525:249:100:Times:100:Times:men...  are  pueri  aeterni,  who  expect  their  wives  to  replace  their  mothers,  and  iron  their  shirts  and  fret  
7:189:15224:12:7:90:292:237:100:Times:100:Times:about their underwear.” McEwan (2006, p. 231).   
7:190:15273:7:16:126:527:230:42:Times:100:Times:3To  address  one  of  the  many  necessary  arbitrary  aggregations  using  the  different  categories,  
7:191:15379:16:11:90:524:214:100:Times:100:Times:consider our classification of volunteer work as leisure.  For the U.S. in 2003 we recalculated the means to 
7:192:15488:11:12:89:525:203:100:Times:100:Times:include  both  volunteer  work  and  non-household  care  activities.  Women  performed  29  minutes  of  these  
7:193:15601:12:11:89:524:191:100:Times:100:Times:activities, men 23, so that the 4-minute excess of men’s all work would be changed to a 2-minute excess of 
7:194:15708:11:12:89:524:180:100:Times:100:Times:women’s total work over men’s if we had included these two categories as household production. Making 
7:195:15810:12:11:89:524:168:100:Times:100:Times:the same calculation for the German data for 2001/02, we find that men performed 11 minutes, women 8 
7:196:15911:11:12:89:524:157:100:Times:100:Times:minutes of volunteer work.  If added to the totals in Table 1, this would have reduced the 8-minute excess 
7:197:16018:12:11:89:524:145:100:Times:100:Times:of female total work to an excess of only 5 minutes.  The same calculation for the Italian data from 2002 
7:198:16124:11:12:89:524:134:100:Times:100:Times:shows that women performed 14 minutes, men 9 minutes of volunteer work. Doing the same thing for the 
7:199:16225:12:11:89:525:122:100:Times:100:Times:Dutch  2000  data  shows  that  men  performed  9  minutes,  women  12  minutes  of  volunteer  work,  which  if  
7:200:16339:11:12:89:525:111:100:Times:100:Times:added  to  household  production  would  have  reduced  the  7-minute  excess  of  male  total  work  to  only  4  
7:201:16454:12:11:89:525:99:100:Times:100:Times:minutes.  In  all  three  recent  Anglo-Saxon  data  sets  this  slight  expansion  of  the  definition  of  total  work  in  
7:202:16580:11:12:89:524:88:100:Times:100:Times:fact equalizes still further the gender distributions of total work, while for Italy it exacerbates the excess of 
7:203:16694:12:11:89:187:76:100:Times:100:Times:female over male work.

8:206:16720:0:25:126:525:709:121:Times:121:Times:To examine gender iso-work further, we obtained raw data sets from Spain and Australia 
8:207:16807:25:25:89:526:684:121:Times:121:Times:and  computed  the  same  aggregates  as  presented  in  Table  1.    Also,  data  for  three  transition  
8:208:16914:25:26:89:526:659:121:Times:121:Times:countries,  Estonia,  Hungary  and  Slovenia,  are  available  from  Aliaga  and  Winqvist  (2003),  the  
8:209:17020:26:25:89:526:633:121:Times:121:Times:same  source  that  underlies  Table  2,  allowing  us  to  make  these  calculations  for  them.    Finally,  
8:210:17131:25:25:89:525:608:121:Times:121:Times:using  various  published  summaries  describing  the  results  of  time-diary  studies  conducted  since  
8:211:17238:25:25:89:524:583:121:Times:121:Times:1992, we calculated the same aggregates by gender for a set of wealthy countries, Canada, Israel, 
8:212:17336:25:26:89:526:558:121:Times:121:Times:Japan,  Mexico  and  New  Zealand,  and  for  a  set  of  sub-Saharan  countries,  Benin,  Madagascar,  
8:213:17440:26:25:89:385:532:121:Times:121:Times:Mauritius and South Africa (from Blackden and Wooden, 2006).    
8:214:17504:25:25:126:527:507:121:Times:121:Times:The  results  of  comparing  men’s  and  women’s  total  work  are  summarized  for  the  25  
8:215:17598:25:26:89:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:countries  by  the  scatter  diagram  in  Figure  1.    The  steepest  line  shows  what  men’s  total  work  
8:216:17708:26:25:89:525:456:121:Times:121:Times:would be if it were identical to women’s total work in a country.  We then estimated a regression 
8:217:17806:25:25:89:524:431:121:Times:121:Times:relating the amount of total work among men to that among women.  Recognizing that men in the 
8:218:17900:25:26:89:525:406:121:Times:121:Times:three  Mediterranean  samples  (Spain,  France  and  Italy)  appear  to  work  less  in  total  than  women,  
8:219:18010:26:25:89:527:380:121:Times:121:Times:we  included  an  indicator  for  the  three  Mediterranean  and  five  middle-income  countries.  The  
8:220:18114:25:25:89:376:355:121:Times:121:Times:regression results (coefficient estimates and standard errors) are: 
8:221:18182:25:13:126:502:330:121:Times:121:Times:Male Work  =  70.72 + 0.80FemaleWork  - 21.53Med/Middle, N= 25, RBar2 = 0.605.

8:226:18619:25:25:89:524:216:121:Times:121:Times:can we reject the hypothesis that the slope on FemaleWork is 1, although the joint hypothesis that 
8:227:18718:25:26:89:526:191:121:Times:121:Times:the  intercept  is  0  and  the  slope  is  1  is  rejected.4    This  fact  is  visible  from  a  comparison  of  the

9:238:19596:25:25:90:524:608:121:Times:121:Times:GDP per capita in purchasing-power-parity terms for each of the 25 countries in our sample (from 
9:239:19693:25:25:90:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:Heston et  al,  2002).    Figure  2  shows  a  scatter  of  the  difference  in  average  minutes  per  day  of

9:246:20339:25:26:90:526:406:121:Times:121:Times:in  all  economies.  It  most  decidedly  does  not  hold  even  today  in  Italy,  and  it  does  not  seem  to  
9:247:20453:26:25:90:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:characterize  other  southern  European  countries  very  well.  Our  results  also  show  that  it  does  not  
9:248:20565:25:25:90:525:355:121:Times:121:Times:hold in middle- or lower-income countries; and Haddad et al (1995) suggest similar findings for 
9:249:20661:25:25:90:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:other  developing  African  economies,  as  do  Goldschmidt-Clermont  and  Pagnossin-Aligisaks  
9:250:20757:25:26:90:525:305:121:Times:121:Times:(1995) for Bulgaria in 1988.  The evidence here makes it clear, however, that iso-work describes 
9:251:20854:26:25:90:525:279:121:Times:121:Times:household behavior and labor markets in rich northern countries generally and is associated with 
9:252:20951:25:28:90:182:254:121:Times:121:Times:higher real incomes. 
9:253:20972:28:30:90:250:226:195:Times:195:Times:3  Novelty and Knowledge 
9:254:20997:30:25:90:525:196:121:Times:121:Times:The iso-work phenomenon has not been noticed by economists, but it has been shown by several 
9:255:21090:25:25:90:526:171:121:Times:121:Times:sociologists.    Robinson  and  Godbey  (1999)  use  data  from  a  UN  report  (Goldschmidt-Clermont  
9:256:21193:25:25:90:521:146:121:Times:121:Times:and Pagnossin-Aligisakis, 1995) to show that this fact describes the average of (recall and time-
9:257:21290:25:26:90:524:121:121:Times:121:Times:diary) data from 14 countries from the 1980s and early 1990s; and Gershuny (2000) shows that it 
9:258:21386:26:25:90:525:95:121:Times:121:Times:approximates the averages across an even larger sample of data sets covering the 1960s through 
9:259:21481:25:32:90:525:70:121:Times:121:Times:mid-1990s.  No  study  has  demonstrated  it  using  data  sets  that  were  as  well  harmonized  as  those  
9:260:21591:32:0:90:309:38:144:Times:144:Times: 7
10:261:21592:0:25:90:527:709:121:Times:121:Times:that  we  have  assembled  here  nor  has  shown  how  closely  it  describes  outcomes  in  individual  
10:262:21697:25:25:90:139:684:121:Times:121:Times:countries.  
10:263:21709:25:26:126:525:659:121:Times:121:Times:The  fact  is  thus  not  new  in  the  sociology  literature,  although  it  is  new  in  the  economics  
10:264:21816:26:25:90:526:633:121:Times:121:Times:literature.    The  difficulty,  however,  is  that  it  has  been  swamped  by  claims  in  widely  circulated  
10:265:21929:25:25:90:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:sociological  studies  (Hochschild,  1997,  and  earlier  work)  based  on  ethnographic  research  on  a  
10:266:22036:25:25:90:529:583:121:Times:121:Times:few  non-randomly  chosen  households  that  women’s  total  work  significantly  exceeds  men’s.    
10:267:22137:25:26:90:526:558:121:Times:121:Times:Indeed,  even  sociologists  who  have  demonstrated  it  (e.g.,  Mattingly  and  Bianchi,  2003,  for  the  
10:268:22246:26:25:90:524:532:121:Times:121:Times:United States, and Bittman and Wajcman, 2000, for several countries), quickly move beyond it to 
10:269:22342:25:25:90:526:507:121:Times:121:Times:focus  on  showing  that  women’s  work  is  more  onerous  than  men’s,  and  why  women’s  leisure  
10:270:22444:25:26:90:195:482:121:Times:121:Times:provides less pleasure.  
10:271:22469:26:25:90:526:456:121:Times:121:Times:  With  other  evidence  demonstrating  gender  iso-work,  one  wonders  whether  the  fact  that  
10:272:22568:25:25:89:525:431:121:Times:121:Times:we  have  demonstrated  is  well  known  among  economists,  other  social  scientists  and  the  general  
10:273:22675:25:26:90:457:406:121:Times:121:Times:public.  To examine this issue we designed a survey that asked only one question:   
10:274:22759:26:19:126:489:380:121:Times:121:Times:“We know that American men (ages 20-75) on average work more in the market 
10:275:22834:19:19:126:490:361:121:Times:121:Times:than  do  American  women.    But  what  is  the  difference  between  men's  TOTAL  
10:276:22919:19:18:126:490:342:121:Times:121:Times:WORK  (in  the  market  and  on  anything  that  you  might  view  as  work  at  home)  
10:277:23007:18:19:126:489:324:121:Times:121:Times:and that of women? Without consulting any books, articles or raw data, PLEASE

10:279:23144:19:19:126:492:286:121:Times:121:Times:CLOSEST  APPROXIMATION  TO  THE  CURRENT  SITUATION  IN  THE  
10:280:23206:19:19:126:156:267:121:Times:121:Times:US.”   
10:281:23213:19:26:90:525:248:121:Times:121:Times:Respondents  were  allowed  nine  possible  responses,  ranging  from  a  25  percent  excess  of  female  
10:282:23320:26:25:90:458:222:121:Times:121:Times:total work, to symmetry around equality, to a 25 percent excess of male total work. 
10:283:23404:25:25:126:525:197:121:Times:121:Times:Early  in  August  2006  we  emailed  this  survey  to  three  groups:    1)  663  labor  economists  
10:284:23506:25:26:89:525:172:121:Times:121:Times:affiliated  with  a  worldwide  network  of  such  researchers.    The  web-based  survey  allowed  us  to  
10:285:23614:26:25:89:524:146:121:Times:121:Times:distinguish respondents who had spent at least six months in the U.S. from those who had not;  2) 
10:286:23712:25:25:89:525:121:121:Times:121:Times:255 elite macro and public finance economists, members of a mostly American network of such 
10:287:23804:25:25:89:524:96:121:Times:121:Times:researchers; and 3) 210 faculty members and graduate students in a leading sociology department 
10:288:23900:25:33:89:526:71:121:Times:121:Times:in  the  U.S.    The  first  and  third  groups  received  follow-up  emails  three  weeks  after  the  initial  
10:289:24013:33:0:90:309:38:144:Times:144:Times: 8
11:290:24014:0:25:90:527:709:121:Times:121:Times:survey.    Also,  early  in  September  2006  we  asked  the  same  question  of  533  students  in  an  
11:291:24119:25:25:90:525:684:121:Times:121:Times:introductory microeconomics class.  Using the information on location in the first group, we thus 
11:292:24217:25:26:90:525:659:121:Times:121:Times:have five separate sets of responses.  The response rates varied, but there is no reason to believe 
11:293:24317:26:25:90:440:633:121:Times:121:Times:that non-respondents were less well-informed about the facts than respondents. 
11:294:24396:25:25:90:525:608:121:Times:121:Times: The results of these surveys are shown in Table 3. The majority of respondents in each of 
11:295:24486:25:25:90:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:the five groups believe that American women perform at least five percent more total work than 
11:296:24581:25:26:90:527:558:121:Times:121:Times:men.    Assigning  half  the  respondents  who  state  that  there  is  equality  to  this  category,  we  
11:297:24688:26:25:90:525:532:121:Times:121:Times:convincingly reject the null hypothesis that the proportions stating that men work less or women 
11:298:24785:25:25:90:525:507:121:Times:121:Times:work less are equal.  Indeed, even if we assign all those stating that there is equality to the “men 
11:299:24886:25:26:90:526:482:121:Times:121:Times:work  more”  group,  this  null  hypothesis  is  rejected  in  some  of  the  samples.    Finally,  for  each  
11:300:24997:26:25:90:525:456:121:Times:121:Times:sample we strongly reject the hypothesis that members of the underlying populations are equally 
11:301:25093:25:25:90:409:431:121:Times:121:Times:likely to state the men work less, the same or more than women in total. 
11:302:25166:25:26:90:525:406:121:Times:121:Times: These surveys show that sociologists, experts in labor economics, leading economists and 
11:303:25255:26:25:90:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:a non-random sample of the public believe that women work more in total than do men.  Indeed, 
11:304:25349:25:25:90:527:355:121:Times:121:Times:the  results  from  the  survey  the  economists  look  very  similar  to  those  from  the  sample  of  
11:305:25454:25:25:90:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:intelligent  college  freshmen.  Perhaps  the  only  consolation  is  that  the  distance  between  opinion  
11:306:25563:25:26:90:526:305:121:Times:121:Times:and  fact  is  less  among  these  groups  of  economists  than  it  is  among  sociologists.    Despite  our  
11:307:25674:26:25:90:525:279:121:Times:121:Times:demonstration of gender equality of total work in the U.S. and most rich countries using current 
11:308:25771:25:25:90:525:254:121:Times:121:Times:time-diary  data,  and  despite  demonstrations  using  time-diary  and  recall  data  of  this  general  fact  
11:309:25883:25:29:90:449:229:121:Times:121:Times:by several sociologists, the groups considered here appear ignorant of the reality. 
11:310:25967:29:29:90:303:200:195:Times:195:Times:4  What Fails to Explain the Facts? 
11:311:26003:29:25:90:525:171:121:Times:121:Times:Economic  theory  predicts  that  a  rise  in  men’s  relative  wage  (the  gender  wage  gap)  will  lead  to  
11:312:26115:25:25:90:527:146:121:Times:121:Times:relatively  less  work  in  the  market  by  women  than  by  men  (assuming  substitution  dominate  
11:313:26217:25:26:90:525:121:121:Times:121:Times:income effects).  The impact of this increase on the relative amount of home work will be in the 
11:314:26314:26:25:90:525:95:121:Times:121:Times:opposite direction, so that the effect of a change in the gender gap on the relative amounts of total 
11:315:26416:25:32:90:526:70:121:Times:121:Times:work  should  be  ambiguous.    Unless,  however,  additional  market  work  is  offset  one-for-one  by  
11:316:26522:32:0:90:309:38:144:Times:144:Times: 9
12:317:26523:0:25:90:528:709:121:Times:121:Times:reduced  household  production  (i.e.,  unless  additional  earnings  are  not  used  at  all  to  take  
12:318:26628:25:25:90:525:684:121:Times:121:Times:additional leisure or spend additional tertiary time), a rise in the gender wage gap should reduce 
12:319:26727:25:26:90:259:659:121:Times:121:Times:women’s total work relative to men’s. 
12:320:26765:26:25:90:525:633:121:Times:121:Times: To examine this possibility we use Polachek and Xiang’s (2006) estimates of the gender 
12:321:26852:25:25:90:525:608:121:Times:121:Times:wage gap.  In particular, for 18 of the 25 countries on which we have recent time-diary data they 
12:322:26950:25:25:90:524:583:121:Times:121:Times:produced estimates of the difference between the logarithms of the medians of the distributions of 
12:323:27049:25:26:90:526:558:121:Times:121:Times:males’  and  females’  wages.    Using  these  data,  in  the  first  two  columns  in  Table  4  we  present  
12:324:27160:26:25:90:525:532:121:Times:121:Times:least-squares estimates of equations describing female-male differences in market and total work 
12:325:27257:25:25:90:521:507:121:Times:121:Times:as  affected  by  the  gender  pay  gap.  The  results  on  market  work  are  consistent  with  an  upward-
12:326:27365:25:26:90:526:482:121:Times:121:Times:sloping relative supply curve of labor to the market.  The market work effect, however, swamps 
12:327:27460:26:25:90:527:456:121:Times:121:Times:the  household  work  effect,  so  that  we  find  that  the  female-male  gap  in  total  work  is  also  
12:328:27567:25:25:90:332:431:121:Times:121:Times:negatively related to the male-female wage difference. 
12:329:27622:25:26:126:526:406:121:Times:121:Times:These findings are not affected by the inclusion of real GDP per capita, as the estimates 
12:330:27712:26:25:89:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:in  Columns  (3)  and  (4)  show,  nor  are  they  affected  by  the  additional  inclusion  of  the  indicator  
12:331:27825:25:25:89:524:355:121:Times:121:Times:variable for Mediterranean and middle-income countries.   Higher relative wages among men lead 
12:332:27920:25:25:89:525:330:121:Times:121:Times:them to work relatively more in the market, less at home, and more in total.  Despite the quality 
12:333:28018:25:26:90:526:305:121:Times:121:Times:of  the  estimates,  the  equation  in  Column  (6)  describes  well  below  half  of  the  variance  in  the  
12:334:28129:26:25:90:524:279:121:Times:121:Times:gender difference in total work.  The difficulty is that, as implied by Tables 1 and 2, three-fourths 
12:335:28231:25:25:90:526:254:121:Times:121:Times:of  the  gender  differences  in  total  work  are  clustered  within  four  percent  of  equality,  while  the  
12:336:28344:25:26:90:521:229:121:Times:121:Times:gender  wage  gaps  range  from  0.13  to  0.59.    Something,  not  equality  in  relative  wages  or  per-
12:337:28452:26:25:90:459:203:121:Times:121:Times:capita income, is causing the pervasive absence of gender differences in total work. 
12:338:28537:25:25:126:526:178:121:Times:121:Times:Taking  a  different  view  of  these  results,  one  might  follow  the  literature  on  household  
12:339:28638:25:26:89:525:153:121:Times:121:Times:behavior (see, e.g., Lundberg and Pollak, 1996) and view the gender relative wage as measuring 
12:340:28733:26:25:89:525:127:121:Times:121:Times:gender differences in power in the household.  By this criterion we should expect that where the 
12:341:28830:25:25:89:526:102:121:Times:121:Times:male-female  pay  gap  is  higher  we  would  observe  men  enjoying  relatively  more  leisure.    The  
12:342:28935:25:39:89:525:77:121:Times:121:Times:estimates  in  Table  4  imply  exactly  the  contrary  results.    Where  one  might  infer  that  men  have  
12:343:29046:39:0:90:312:38:144:Times:144:Times: 10
13:344:29048:0:25:90:525:709:121:Times:121:Times:more power, as measured by relative wages, they also work relatively more in total compared to 
13:345:29143:25:25:89:127:684:121:Times:121:Times:women. 
13:346:29150:25:26:126:526:659:121:Times:121:Times:A  second  possible  explanation  for  some  of  these  facts  is  that  husbands  and  wives  pay  
13:347:29250:26:25:89:525:633:121:Times:121:Times:attention to each other’s labor and leisure, so that we observe gender equality at the means in rich 
13:348:29351:25:25:89:525:608:121:Times:121:Times:countries  because  most  adult  men  and  women  are  married.    To  examine  this  possibility  in  the  
13:349:29459:25:25:89:525:583:121:Times:121:Times:aggregate,  in  Table  5  we  present  means  of  market  work  and  home  work  by  gender  and  marital  
13:350:29566:25:26:89:525:558:121:Times:121:Times:status for the United States in 2003 and Germany in 2001/02.  While the female-male gap in total 
13:351:29663:26:25:89:524:532:121:Times:121:Times:work is higher among unmarried adults, in the United States it varies across marital status within 
13:352:29762:25:25:89:510:507:121:Times:121:Times:5 percent of equality.  In Germany the gap is larger among unmarried adults, but still not huge. 
13:353:29859:25:26:125:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:An  explicit  test  of  the  notion  that  gender  iso-work  is  generated  by  husbands  and  wives  
13:354:29961:26:25:89:522:456:121:Times:121:Times:focusing  on  each  other’s  work  effort  as  part  of  marriage  can  be  conducted  by  examining  inter-
13:355:30069:25:25:89:525:431:121:Times:121:Times:household  dispersion  in  the  within-household  gender  total  work  gap.    For  the  2001/02  German  
13:356:30175:25:26:89:525:406:121:Times:121:Times:data  this  is  easy,  as  diaries  were  collected  from  both  spouses.    This  examination  is  not  possible  
13:357:30290:26:25:89:526:380:121:Times:121:Times:for  the  U.S.  in  2003,  so  instead  we  use  the  much  smaller  1985  U.S.  Time  Use  Survey,  which

14:374:31740:33:22:79:516:691:11:Times:11:Times:Our findings suggest that there must be a mechanism that coordinates the total time spent on market
14:375:31839:22:22:79:499:669:11:Times:11:Times:work and secondary activities across males and females, whether they are married or unmarried.
14:376:31933:22:22:96:516:647:11:Times:11:Times:The simplest coordination device that equalizes total work across agents isasocial norm for
14:377:32024:22:22:79:515:625:11:Times:11:Times:leisurethat serves as focal point for the determination of total work. Peer pressure or a strong desire
14:378:32127:22:22:79:515:603:11:Times:11:Times:to conform to a common social norm for time allocation mute market incentives andweaken the
14:379:32218:22:22:79:515:581:11:Times:11:Times:impact of individual tastes.  As a result, time use becomes more similar across individuals.6If the
14:380:32317:22:22:79:516:559:11:Times:11:Times:social norm is strong enough to drive the agent to conform fully, we obtain the iso-work result we
14:381:32415:22:22:79:515:537:11:Times:11:Times:observe in the data.7Alternative explanations of the iso-work fact are, of course, possible; but all
14:382:32515:22:38:79:508:515:11:Times:11:Times:must involve, in one way or another, an interplay between social interactions and individual tastes.

14:394:33093:14:15:92:516:169:6:Times:9:Times:6For a survey of social norms and economic theory, see Elster (1989). Social norms have been studied, among others,
14:395:33208:15:11:79:515:154:9:Times:9:Times:by Akerlof (1980), Jones (1984), Cole et al. (1992), Kandori (1992), Young (1996), Lindbeck (1997), and Lindbeck et al.
14:396:33327:11:7:79:105:143:9:Times:9:Times:(1999).
14:397:33334:7:15:92:516:136:6:Times:9:Times:7In this simple story, total conformity only occurs if the desire to conform is infinitely strong. The literature (Bernheim,
14:398:33458:15:8:79:420:121:9:Times:9:Times:1994) has sought ways to obtain full conformity without assuming an infinite cost of deviation.
14:399:33553:8:67:92:375:113:6:Times:9:Times:8Here, and in what follows, we ignore non-negativity constraints for simplicity.
14:400:33633:67:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:12
15:401:33635:0:22:79:515:724:11:Times:11:Times:We call this the agent’sintrinsicleisure optimum.9It is determined by private incentives, prices and
15:402:33735:22:22:79:161:702:11:Times:11:Times:budget constraints.
15:403:33754:22:22:96:515:680:11:Times:11:Times:Now suppose that there is a social norm that influences, but does not mandate, individual leisure.
15:404:33852:22:22:79:515:658:11:Times:11:Times:We mean by this that agents can choose the extent to which they stick to the norm,and balance
15:405:33945:22:22:79:515:636:11:Times:11:Times:optimally the marginal costs and benefits of deviating from it. The cost of deviating may stem from
15:406:34044:22:22:79:516:614:11:Times:11:Times:guilt (an internal psychological process) or shame (an external peerpressure or a reputational mech-
15:407:34144:22:22:79:516:592:11:Times:11:Times:anism).  The benefit of deviating results from the joy of following one’s ownunbridled inclinations
15:408:34243:22:22:79:237:570:11:Times:11:Times:that in general differ from the norm.
15:409:34280:22:21:96:516:548:11:Times:11:Times:Formally, assume that there is a quadratic cost of deviating from the leisure normL∗, and pa-
15:410:34373:21:22:79:515:527:11:Times:11:Times:rameterize the strength of the social norm by the coefficientφ≥0,10so that the utility function
15:411:34468:22:22:79:117:505:11:Times:11:Times:becomes
15:412:34475:22:33:208:387:483:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C−(1/2ǫ)(1−L)2−(φ/2)(L−L∗)2.
15:413:34503:33:22:79:157:450:11:Times:11:Times:Optimal leisure is
15:414:34521:22:32:212:516:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:L=α(1−ǫw) + (1−α)L∗≡L(w),(4)
15:415:34549:32:40:79:276:396:11:Times:11:Times:with the weightα, between0and1, given by

15:419:34598:32:22:79:515:317:11:Times:11:g_d0_f5:Intuitively,  the social norm pulls optimal leisure choice away from the intrinsicoptimum1−ǫw
15:420:34691:22:22:79:515:295:11:Times:11:Times:and towardsL∗.  The coefficientαis small, and optimal leisure is close to the norm, if the social
15:421:34788:22:22:79:515:273:11:Times:11:g_d0_f5:norm  is  strong  (φlarge)  or  leisure  is  not  too  wage  inelastic  (ǫlarge).   Higher  wages,  holdingα
15:422:34896:22:22:79:516:251:11:Times:11:Times:constant,  increase  the  distance  betweenLandL∗by  making  it  more  costly  to  deviate  from  the
15:423:34997:22:16:79:160:229:11:Times:11:Times:intrinsic optimum.
15:424:35015:16:15:92:516:213:6:Times:9:Times:9By assumingǫ >0, we exclude cases in which the labor-supply curve is backward-bending. We assume the wage rate
15:425:35126:15:8:79:278:198:9:Times:9:Times:is always below1/ǫto avoid corner solutions atL= 0.
15:426:35177:8:14:89:515:190:6:Times:9:Times:10The strength of the norm for an individual may depend on the number ofpeople who have adopted it.  We examine
15:427:35288:14:130:79:157:176:9:Times:9:Times:this possibility below.
15:428:35311:130:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:13
16:429:35313:0:29:79:198:724:11:Times:11:Times:5.1.1    Wage Gender Gap
16:430:35337:29:22:79:516:695:11:Times:11:Times:Now assume that male (M) and female (F) wages differ, but that the wage sensitivity of leisure (α)
16:431:35435:22:40:79:419:673:11:Times:11:Times:is identical by gender.11The resultingleisure gapbetween man and women is
16:432:35508:40:25:232:362:633:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:Lm−Lf=L(wm)−L(wf)
16:433:35525:25:40:276:362:608:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:=−αǫ(wm−wf).
16:434:35537:40:21:79:514:568:11:Times:8:g_d0_f12:Explaining the iso-work fact requires examining under which circumstances the leisure gapLm−Lf
16:435:35631:21:22:79:516:547:11:Times:11:Times:may be close to zero. Sinceαis decreasing inφ, this requires that norm be very strong. In the limit,
16:436:35731:22:22:79:515:525:11:g_d0_f7:11:Times:limφ→∞(Lm−Lf) = 0.  In words, a very strong norm mutes the effect of wages on leisure, and
16:437:35821:22:22:79:361:503:11:Times:11:Times:equalizes male and female leisure and thereby leads to iso-work.
16:438:35885:22:22:96:516:481:11:Times:11:Times:While this result may appear trivial, its derivation reveals what is perhaps the most crucial ingre-
16:439:35985:22:22:79:515:459:11:Times:11:Times:dient of a norm-based explanation of the total work fact: the assumption thatmen and women share
16:440:36081:22:22:79:515:437:11:Times:11:Times:agender-neutral norm.  It is because the leisure norm of males and females is gender-neutral that a
16:441:36180:22:22:79:515:415:11:Times:11:Times:largerφeliminates the differences between male and female leisure.  Were the norm dependent on
16:442:36274:22:22:79:516:393:11:Times:11:Times:gender, we would,ceteris paribus, observe different male and female leisure even whenφ= +∞.
16:443:36365:22:22:79:516:371:11:Times:11:Times:Hence the fact that total work is essentially invariant to gender in high-income countries (but less
16:444:36465:22:22:79:516:349:11:Times:11:Times:so in poorer economies) suggests, if the social norm story is correct, that a fundamental change of
16:445:36564:22:22:79:516:327:11:Times:11:Times:norms takes place in the process of economic development:  gender-neutral, or gender-blind norms
16:446:36660:22:22:79:515:305:11:Times:11:Times:replace gender-specific references for leisure (and more generallyfor consumption).12We return
16:447:36754:22:38:79:294:283:11:Times:11:Times:below to the theme of gender-neutral norms later.
16:448:36803:38:29:79:355:245:12:Times:12:Times:5.2One Norm for All, Within-Gender Heterogeneity
16:449:36851:29:22:79:515:216:11:Times:11:Times:Although  it  provides  us  with  an  important  insight,  the  small  model  we  have  just  outlined  is  not
16:450:36962:22:22:79:516:194:11:Times:11:Times:sufficient to rationalize all the facts in our possession. The empirical difficulty we face is that the iso-
16:451:37070:22:22:79:516:172:11:Times:11:Times:work fact coexists with significant within-gender (and more generally within-group) heterogeneity
16:452:37167:22:22:79:516:150:11:Times:11:Times:of leisure.  This is inconsistent with the simple story told above,  because asφ→+∞the labor
16:453:37259:22:15:79:516:128:11:Times:11:Times:supply of each individual, whether male or female, converges to the common,gender-neutral norm
16:454:37353:15:15:89:516:113:6:Times:9:Times:11This last assumption, which is of course at odds with estimates of labor supply elasticities for males and females, can
16:455:37474:15:7:79:141:98:9:Times:9:Times:easily be relaxed.
16:456:37492:7:15:89:515:91:6:Times:9:Times:12Note that no causal statement is being made here. One can easily write models in which gender-specific norms cause
16:457:37608:15:30:79:436:76:9:Times:9:Times:economic backwardness, and models in which competition and development cause gender equality.

17:459:37703:0:22:79:516:724:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:L∗regardless of the wage.13As a result, while a strong norm bridges the gap between male and
17:460:37795:22:39:79:411:702:11:Times:11:Times:female leisure, it also eliminates any within-gender heterogeneity of leisure.
17:461:37873:39:29:79:182:663:12:Times:12:Times:5.3Social Clusters
17:462:37891:29:22:79:516:634:11:Times:11:Times:This unpleasant feature of our model can be avoided by introducing non-gender basedsocial clusters,
17:463:37990:22:22:79:188:612:11:Times:11:Times:or multiple social norms.
17:464:38015:22:22:96:515:590:11:Times:11:Times:Imagine thateachgender is stratified into social clusters that are defined by the relative position
17:465:38114:22:22:79:515:568:11:Times:11:Times:in  the  wage  distribution  (e.g.,  above  or  below  the  median  female  or  male  wage).   Wecould  just
17:466:38222:22:21:79:516:546:11:Times:11:Times:as well split agents according to the color of their eyes, the month in which theyare born, or the
17:467:38320:21:22:79:515:525:11:Times:11:Times:neighborhood in which they live.   The crucial ingredient is that these social clusters be based on
17:468:38419:22:22:79:515:503:11:Times:11:Times:gender-neutral characteristics: the fractions of men or women above themedian wage of their gender
17:469:38517:22:22:79:515:481:11:Times:11:Times:is identical, and so are (presumably) the proportions of men and women who have blue eyes, are born

17:488:39260:21:11:89:376:125:6:Times:9:Times:13This is also true ifǫ, the sensitivity of leisure to the wage, differs across sexes.
17:489:39346:11:14:89:515:114:6:Times:9:Times:14A high/low wage social norm defined in terms of position relative to themeanwage would, for asymmetric wage
17:490:39455:14:11:79:515:100:9:Times:9:Times:distributions, deliver norms whose adoption is correlated with gender as long as the means are different. Any model based
17:491:39576:11:43:79:326:89:9:Times:9:Times:on such a specification will not be able to replicate the iso-work fact.
17:492:39648:43:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:15
18:493:39650:0:37:96:419:724:11:Times:11:Times:We immediately conclude that the leisure gap between men and women is
18:494:39719:37:42:233:362:687:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5: ̄Lm− ̄Lf=−αǫ(  ̄wm− ̄wf).
18:495:39745:42:22:79:516:645:11:Times:11:Times:This is the same formula as when there is a single social norm.  As before, the leisure gap goes to
18:496:39844:22:22:79:516:623:11:Times:11:Times:zero and the iso-work fact holds asymptotically when the social norm becomes more compelling
18:497:39936:22:22:79:515:601:11:Times:11:Times:(φ→ ∞, so thatα→0).  However, the existence of many social clusters (delineated by categories
18:498:40029:22:22:79:516:579:11:Times:11:Times:that are orthogonal to gender) ensures thatwithin-genderheterogeneity of leisure is not shrunk to
18:499:40126:22:39:79:208:557:11:Times:11:Times:zero asφbecomes very large.
18:500:40153:39:29:79:237:518:12:Times:12:Times:5.4Even More Heterogeneity
18:501:40179:29:22:79:515:489:11:Times:11:Times:Although the previous model of social clusters maintains within-gender heterogeneity across clusters,
18:502:40280:22:22:79:515:467:11:Times:11:Times:one might be worried that it does not permitwithin-clustervariance:  within each (high, low) wage
18:503:40377:22:22:79:515:445:11:Times:11:Times:category, leisure indeed becomes identical for agents of the two sexes asthe corresponding leisure
18:504:40475:22:22:79:283:423:11:Times:11:Times:norm becomes infinitely compelling (φ→∞).
18:505:40516:22:22:96:515:401:11:Times:11:Times:One way to avoid this problem is to define yet more dimensions of clustering based on other
18:506:40607:22:21:79:516:379:11:Times:11:Times:characteristics of agents, and to repeat the reasoning of this section forthis finer partitioning of the
18:507:40711:21:22:79:516:358:11:Times:11:Times:population.  By doing so — provided of course the resulting categories areuncorrelated with sex
18:508:40806:22:22:79:515:336:11:Times:11:Times:— we could again replicate the iso-work fact yet generate as much within-gender heterogeneity as
18:509:40902:22:22:79:516:314:11:Times:11:Times:desired by making each social norm increasingly compelling.  Of course, we would still find that
18:510:40998:22:22:79:515:292:11:Times:11:Times:within-category heterogeneity would go to zero, but this would not be much of a problem anymore
18:511:41093:22:22:79:262:270:11:Times:11:Times:as the categories would be arbitrarily fine.
18:512:41137:22:22:96:516:248:11:Times:11:Times:Another way to maintain within-category heterogeneity as norms become more and more binding
18:513:41228:22:22:79:516:226:11:Times:11:Times:would be to introduce a dimension of idiosyncratic heterogeneity in the population. This heterogene-
18:514:41328:22:22:79:516:204:11:Times:11:Times:ity could stem from different tastes, or from a noisy individual observation of the societal leisure
18:515:41428:22:22:79:515:182:11:Times:11:Times:norm.15To illustrate how this line of reasoning would play out in our setup, let us go back to the
18:516:41526:22:22:79:516:160:11:Times:11:Times:first of our models with one normL∗for all, identical wages for all members of a given sex, and a
18:517:41623:22:16:79:515:138:11:Times:11:Times:different wage for male and female workers. Imagine that individualkobserves the norm with some
18:518:41718:16:15:89:515:122:6:Times:9:Times:15As we do not wish to transform the quest for a theoretical explanation of the iso-work fact into a futile data-fitting
18:519:41838:15:11:79:516:107:9:Times:9:Times:exercise, we prefer the second interpretation, which is potentially falsifiable, to the first, which multiplies unobservable
18:520:41962:11:50:79:121:96:9:Times:9:Times:parameters.
18:521:41973:50:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:16
19:522:41975:0:22:79:515:724:11:Times:11:Times:measurement errorλk, in the sense that he thinks the desirable norm isL∗+λkinstead ofL∗.16As
19:523:42067:22:40:79:304:702:11:Times:11:Times:a result, optimal leisure for that individual becomes
19:524:42120:40:39:212:382:662:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lk=α(1−ǫw) + (1−α)(L∗+λk),
19:525:42146:39:22:79:515:623:11:Times:11:Times:withαdefined exactly as above.  HenceLk→L∗+λkasφ→ ∞(andα→0) regardless of
19:526:42219:22:22:79:516:601:11:Times:11:Times:the wage, i.e.  regardless of whether one is male or female.  Now suppose measurement errors are
19:527:42315:22:22:79:515:579:11:Times:11:Times:idiosyncratic in the sense that theλ’ average to zero for each sex.17Then it is straightforward to
19:528:42413:22:22:79:516:557:11:Times:11:Times:show the leisure gap is zero, and the iso-work fact holds exactly whenφ→ ∞—in spite of the fact
19:529:42508:22:22:79:515:535:11:Times:11:Times:that each agent ends up taking a different amount of leisure due to an idiosyncratic perception of the
19:530:42610:22:39:79:105:513:11:Times:11:Times:norm.
19:531:42615:39:29:79:312:474:12:Times:12:Times:5.5Accounting for Variations in Total Work
19:532:42657:29:22:79:515:445:11:Times:11:Times:The data presented in Section 2 make it clear that, although total work is strikingly equal across men
19:533:42759:22:22:79:515:423:11:Times:11:Times:and women, it does vary, sometimes substantially, across countries, regionand over time.  Since we
19:534:42857:22:22:79:516:401:11:Times:11:Times:have attempted in the previous section to rationalize the iso-work fact by social norms by arguing
19:535:42955:22:21:79:515:379:11:Times:11:Times:that they serve as a coordination device between male and female total work,we must also explain
19:536:43051:21:22:79:169:358:11:Times:11:Times:how norms can vary.
19:537:43070:22:22:96:516:336:11:Times:11:Times:Let us return yet again to our simplest model of social norms:  men and womenhave the same
19:538:43160:22:22:79:515:314:11:Times:11:Times:preferences but face a different, unique, wage, there are no within-gender wage differences, and men
19:539:43260:22:22:79:515:292:11:Times:11:Times:and women adopt a common leisure normL∗. Remember that in that model male and female leisure
19:540:43352:22:40:79:132:270:11:Times:11:Times:are given by
19:541:43364:40:25:223:371:230:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lm=α(1−ǫwm) + (1−α)L∗,
19:542:43386:25:39:226:368:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Lf=α(1−ǫwf) + (1−α)L∗.
19:543:43408:39:22:79:515:166:11:Times:11:Times:Now close the model by assuming that that the gender-neutral normL∗reflectsaverage leisureacross
19:544:43504:22:17:79:516:144:11:Times:11:Times:males and females in society.  Since there are equal proportions of men and women, in equilibrium
19:545:43601:17:11:89:476:127:6:Times:9:Times:16For example, an individual of typekhas utility functionC−(1/2ǫ)(1−L)2−(φ/2)[L−(L∗+λk)]2.
19:546:43691:11:70:89:470:116:6:Times:9:Times:17This leaves open the possibility that females and males perceive the socialnorm with different precision.
19:547:43798:70:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:17
20:548:43800:0:15:79:117:724:11:Times:11:Times:we have,
20:549:43808:15:15:254:259:709:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:1
20:550:43809:15:0:254:259:694:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2
20:551:43810:0:32:261:341:702:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:(Lm+Lf) =L∗.
20:552:43822:32:22:79:515:670:11:Times:11:Times:Combining the last three equations and solving forL∗, we conclude that theequilibrium social norm
20:553:43919:22:22:79:166:648:11:Times:11:Times:for leisureis simply
20:554:43939:22:33:267:328:626:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:L∗= 1−ǫ ̄w,
20:555:43950:33:22:79:106:593:11:Times:11:Times:where
20:556:43955:22:0:265:282:571:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7: ̄w=
20:557:43959:0:15:287:329:579:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f12:wm+wf
20:558:43964:15:25:306:311:564:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2
20:559:43965:25:22:79:355:539:11:Times:11:Times:is the average wage in the whole (maleandfemale) population.
20:560:44025:22:22:96:516:517:11:Times:11:Times:The story is very simple:  the equilibrium social norm for leisure is independent of the strength
20:561:44122:22:22:79:515:495:11:Times:11:Times:of the norm, but it is negatively affected by the average wage rate ̄w, with a response coefficient that
20:562:44226:22:22:79:515:473:11:Times:11:Times:depends on the sensitivityǫof individual leisure to the wage.  Whenever these magnitudes change,
20:563:44322:22:22:79:515:451:11:Times:11:Times:across countries or over time, the social norm for leisure varies.  Thereis no reason to expect it to
20:564:44423:22:38:79:280:429:11:Times:11:Times:remain to be constant over space or over time.
20:565:44469:38:23:79:515:391:12:Times:12:Times:5.6Accounting for the Relationship between GDP Per Capita and the Female-Male
20:566:44546:23:29:106:220:368:12:Times:12:Times:Total Work Difference
20:567:44567:29:22:79:515:339:11:Times:11:Times:We have argued above that female-male differences in total work are negatively related to GDP per
20:568:44664:22:22:79:516:317:11:Times:11:Times:capita.  There are two ways we can account for this fact in a theory of social norms.  The first relies
20:569:44767:22:22:79:516:295:11:Times:11:Times:on the link between economic development and the increased gender-neutrality of social reference
20:570:44863:22:22:79:516:273:11:Times:11:Times:groups. The second, which is slightly moread hoc, assumes that the cost of deviating from a social
20:571:44961:22:22:79:245:251:11:Times:11:Times:norm is positively related to the wage.
20:572:45000:22:22:96:515:229:11:Times:11:Times:The model of social clusters we have outlined above is able to account forthe reduction in the
20:573:45094:22:21:79:515:207:11:Times:11:Times:female-male total work difference as GDP per capita grows provided economic growth is positively
20:574:45190:21:22:79:516:186:11:Times:11:Times:correlated with the adoption of gender-neutral reference groups.  Suppose for instance that at low
20:575:45288:22:22:79:515:164:11:Times:11:Times:income levels there are two leisure reference groups: one for men, and one for women, each with a
20:576:45385:22:22:79:516:142:11:Times:11:Times:different (gender-specific) leisure norm. Then, trivially, iso-work does not hold at low income levels.
20:577:45488:22:22:79:516:120:11:Times:11:Times:If  gender-defined  social  clusters  are  replaced  by  gender-neutralreference  groups  as  income  rises
20:578:45595:22:22:79:515:98:11:Times:11:Times:(e.g., at quantiles of income distributions), then development will be associated with a convergence
20:579:45695:22:30:79:300:76:11:Times:11:Times:of the total work difference across genders to zero.
20:580:45747:30:0:292:303:46:11:Times:11:Times:18
21:581:45749:0:22:96:516:724:11:Times:11:Times:An alternative, possibly complementary explanation relaxes the assumption that deviating from
21:582:45842:22:22:79:515:702:11:Times:11:Times:the norm entails a utility cost that is independent of the level of the individual’s wage. Let us consider
21:583:45948:22:22:79:515:680:11:Times:11:Times:(in the one-norm model) what happens if people get are harassed whenthey deviate from the norm.
21:584:46043:22:22:79:515:658:11:Times:11:Times:That is, imagine that, instead of suffering a direct utility loss as envisaged above, deviants lose time
21:585:46147:22:22:79:515:636:11:Times:11:Times:fending off their critics, mending their reputation, or battling inner guilt feelings at the cost of time
21:586:46252:22:39:79:295:614:11:Times:11:Times:available for work or leisure. Namely, they solve:
21:587:46302:39:40:252:516:575:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:C−(1/2ǫ)(1−L)2(5)
21:588:46319:40:40:79:171:535:11:Times:11:Times:subject to constraints
21:589:46341:40:25:265:516:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:C= Ω +wH,(6)
21:590:46353:25:0:236:277:470:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:L+H+
21:591:46357:0:15:281:287:478:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:φ
21:592:46358:15:0:282:287:463:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:2
21:593:46359:0:39:289:516:470:11:g_d0_f7:11:Times:(L−L∗)2= 1.(7)
21:594:46373:39:22:79:515:431:11:Times:11:Times:It is straightforward to show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to that of the
21:595:46474:22:22:79:516:409:11:Times:11:Times:utility-loss model provided we replace the parameterφin the latter model byφw. In other words, the
21:596:46572:22:22:79:515:387:11:Times:11:Times:“harassment” model is just the utility loss model with a cost of deviation proportional to the wage.
21:597:46672:22:40:79:437:365:11:Times:11:Times:Therefore, adapting equation (4), we conclude that optimal leisure in this model is
21:598:46755:40:39:216:516:325:11:g_d0_f5:11:Times:L=α(w)(1−ǫw) + [1−α(w)]L∗,(8)
21:599:46784:39:22:79:241:286:11:Times:11:Times:with the weightα(w)now defined as
21:600:46817:22:0:265:283:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:α=
21:601:46819:0:15:305:310:271:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:1
21:602:46820:15:25:287:328:256:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:1 +φǫw.
21:603:46827:25:22:79:516:231:11:Times:11:Times:At low wage or development levels (wclose to zero), the weightα(w)is close to1so that the intrinsic
21:604:46926:22:22:79:516:209:11:Times:11:Times:optimum1−wis the main determinant of leisure.  At high wage or development levels (whigh),
21:605:47016:22:21:79:515:187:11:Times:11:Times:and given the parameterφ, the weightα(w)approaches zero and the social norm becomes the sole
21:606:47108:21:22:79:516:166:11:Times:11:Times:determinant of optimal leisure. As the value of time increases, so does the cost of deviating from the
21:607:47210:22:98:79:311:144:11:Times:11:Times:norm, resulting in a smaller deviation from the norm.

22:609:47265:0:29:90:444:706:195:Times:195:Times:6  Some Evidence on the Role of Social Norms in Iso-Work 
22:610:47322:29:25:90:526:677:121:Times:121:Times:The  theory  developed  in  the  last  section  is  not  easy  to  test  directly.  We  can,  however,  perform  
22:611:47435:25:25:90:526:652:121:Times:121:Times:several  additional  examinations  that  can  allow  us  to  infer  whether  the  role  of  social  norms  is  
22:612:47546:25:26:90:526:627:121:Times:121:Times:consistent  with  observed  behavior  in  our  two  main  data  sets.    If  the  notion  of  social  clusters  is  
22:613:47662:26:25:90:526:601:121:Times:121:Times:correct,  we  should  expect  that  differences  in  total  work  across  various  cuts  of  the  data  will  be  
22:614:47776:25:25:90:528:576:121:Times:121:Times:large  compared  to  gender  differences  within  a  cluster.    Consider  first  cutting  the  data  by  
22:615:47882:25:26:90:524:551:121:Times:121:Times:educational category.  In the 2003 U.S. data we divide the adult population into those with fewer

22:617:48094:25:25:90:525:500:121:Times:121:Times:data we create the four categories volksschule/hauptschule (basic), mittlere reife/realschule (high 
22:618:48194:25:25:90:461:475:121:Times:121:Times:school), fachoberschule/fachabitur (vocationally qualified), and abitur (university). 
22:619:48280:25:26:126:525:450:121:Times:121:Times:Table  6  shows  the  average  minutes  of  market  and  total  work  by  gender  for  each  of  the  
22:620:48382:26:25:90:525:424:121:Times:121:Times:four education categories in the U.S. and Germany.  In both countries gender differences in total 
22:621:48480:25:25:90:526:399:121:Times:121:Times:work within education categories are quite small, with the highest being the 5 percent excess of 
22:622:48577:25:26:90:528:374:121:Times:121:Times:female  over  male  total  work  among  the  most  educated  Germans  and  the  least  educated  
22:623:48674:26:25:90:527:348:121:Times:121:Times:Americans.    Differences  across  categories  in  total  work  independent  of  gender  are,  however,  
22:624:48779:25:25:90:525:323:121:Times:121:Times:huge:    In  the  United  States  the  percentage  difference  between  the  highest  and  lowest  education  
22:625:48889:25:26:90:527:298:121:Times:121:Times:categories in the average amount of total work is 39 percent, while in Germany it is 13 percent.18  
22:626:48989:26:25:90:525:272:121:Times:121:Times:Clearly,  gender  differences  are  tiny  compared  to  those  resulting  from  differences  in  educational  
22:627:49099:25:25:90:142:247:121:Times:121:Times:attainment. 
22:628:49111:25:26:125:526:222:121:Times:121:Times:Similarly,  the  data  could  be  cut  by  region.    To  the  extent  that  there  are  inter-regional  
22:629:49216:26:25:90:527:196:121:Times:121:Times:cultural  differences  ,we  might  expect  different  norms  about  total  work  across  regions,  even  
22:630:49321:25:25:90:526:171:121:Times:121:Times:though  gender  differences  within  region  are  small.    Possibilities  for  examining  this  notion  are  
22:631:49431:25:25:90:526:146:121:Times:121:Times:limited  in  both  data  sets  by  sample  size.    Also,  confidentiality  restrictions  on  the  German  data  
22:632:49544:25:21:90:527:121:121:Times:121:Times:prevent  us  from  obtaining  a  finer  geographic  breakdown  than  West  and  East.    Within  these  
22:633:49648:21:8:90:237:100:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
22:634:49696:8:16:126:524:92:42:Times:100:Times:18That the spread across education categories is so much greater in the U.S. may be due to the fact 
22:635:49796:16:11:89:524:76:100:Times:100:Times:(Devroye and Freeman, 2001) that differences in educational attainment imply much greater differences in 
22:636:49901:11:27:89:242:65:100:Times:100:Times:literacy in the U.S. than in Germany.  
22:637:49940:27:0:90:312:38:144:Times:144:Times: 20
23:638:49942:0:25:90:526:709:121:Times:121:Times:limitations  we  divide  the  U.S.  sample  into  the  four  main  Census  regions,  and  the  German  data  
23:639:50051:25:25:90:178:684:121:Times:121:Times:into West and East. 
23:640:50071:25:26:126:524:659:121:Times:121:Times:Averages of market and total work by gender within geographic area are shown in Table 
23:641:50157:26:25:90:525:633:121:Times:121:Times:7.  Notice first that within-region differences in total work by gender are not large.  While those 
23:642:50257:25:25:90:528:608:121:Times:121:Times:in the South and within each German region are statistically significant, none exceeds 3 percent.  
23:643:50356:25:25:90:526:583:121:Times:121:Times:For  the  U.S.  let  us  focus  on  differences  between  the  South  and  the  rest  of  the  country.  Among  
23:644:50468:25:26:90:525:558:121:Times:121:Times:Southern women total work is nearly 6 percent below that in the rest of the nation, while among 
23:645:50564:26:25:90:526:532:121:Times:121:Times:Southern  men  it  is  3  percent  below.    The  former  difference  is  over  three  times  bigger  than  the  
23:646:50677:25:25:90:525:507:121:Times:121:Times:largest  within-region  gender  difference  in  total  work.    For  Germany  we  observe  a  qualitatively  
23:647:50786:25:26:90:524:482:121:Times:121:Times:similar outcome:  West-East differences in total work are 4 percent among women and 3 percent 
23:648:50880:26:25:90:521:456:121:Times:121:Times:among  men.    The  contrast  between  inter-regional  differences  in  average  total  work  and  within-
23:649:50986:25:25:90:526:431:121:Times:121:Times:region  differences  by  gender  is  consistent  with  the  notion  of  clustering  on  norms,  although  the  
23:650:51097:25:25:90:482:406:121:Times:121:Times:contrast is not as great as that observed when we cut the data by educational attainment.  
23:651:51188:25:26:126:526:381:121:Times:121:Times:A  final  bit  of  evidence  asks,  without  any  claims  of  causation,  whether  attitudes  about  
23:652:51289:26:25:89:524:355:121:Times:121:Times:gender roles are related to gender differences in total work.  To examine this relationship we use 
23:653:51388:25:25:89:526:330:121:Times:121:Times:data  collected  at  various  times  in  the  1990s  by  the  World  Values  Surveys.    Respondents  in  
23:654:51494:25:26:89:524:305:121:Times:121:Times:various countries were asked whether they agreed with the statement, “When jobs are scarce, men 
23:655:51590:26:25:89:524:279:121:Times:121:Times:should have more right to a job than women.” Taking averages of these data (from Fortin, 2005, 
23:656:51685:25:25:89:525:254:121:Times:121:Times:Appendix Table 1), we graph them in relation to the female-male difference in total work for the 
23:657:51782:25:26:89:398:229:121:Times:121:Times:16 countries (of the 25 used in Figure 1) for which they are available. 
23:658:51854:26:25:126:525:203:121:Times:121:Times:The scatter diagrams relating the total work difference to the fraction of respondents who 
23:659:51945:25:25:90:527:178:121:Times:121:Times:agree  with  the  statement  that  scarce  jobs  should  go  to  men  are  presented  in  Figures  4a  for  
23:660:52053:25:26:90:526:153:121:Times:121:Times:women’s  attitudes  on  this  issue  and  in  Figure  4b  for  men’s  attitudes.    The  scatters  look  very  
23:661:52164:26:89:90:525:127:121:Times:121:Times:similar:  In both cases what we might interpret as beliefs in male dominance are positively related

24:663:52266:0:25:90:524:709:121:Times:121:Times:to the female-male gap in total work.19  Implicitly, in countries where the expressed norm favors 
24:664:52364:25:28:90:481:684:121:Times:121:Times:men, women perform a greater share of the total amount of market and household work. 
24:665:52449:28:32:90:530:656:195:Times:195:Times:7    Conclusion:  The  Importance  of  the  Iso-Work  Phenomenon  for  
24:666:52520:32:30:90:200:624:195:Times:195:Times:Economic Models 
24:667:52536:30:25:90:525:594:121:Times:121:Times:In Section 5 we showed that the iso-work fact and the approach to it across phases of economic 
24:668:52631:25:25:90:524:569:121:Times:121:Times:development place tight constraints on the modeling of labor supply behavior across gender. Any 
24:669:52727:25:26:90:524:544:121:Times:121:Times:nontrivial gender-neutral model of labor supply must rely on the existence of strong cluster norms 
24:670:52826:26:25:89:526:518:121:Times:121:Times:to  coordinate  behavior,  or  rely  on  implausible  mean-preserving  transformations  of  underlying  
24:671:52930:25:25:89:526:493:121:Times:121:Times:distributions  which  are  in  turn  unlikely  to  be  common  across  gender.  Consequently,  iso-work  
24:672:53035:25:25:89:524:468:121:Times:121:Times:gives rise to a number of conundrums for economic models which rely on work-leisure choices to 
24:673:53130:25:26:89:370:443:121:Times:121:Times:characterize economic behavior in both the short and long run.  
24:674:53194:26:25:89:529:417:121:Times:121:Times:   Consider   first   the   implications   for   business-cycle   theories   and   macroeconomics.   
24:675:53295:25:25:89:525:392:121:Times:121:Times:Although  we  have  not  emphasized  it,  the  evidence  supports  the  iso-work  phenomenon  over  the  
24:676:53400:25:26:89:524:367:121:Times:121:Times:business cycle.20  Business cycle fluctuations are typically characterized by movements of market 
24:677:53498:26:25:89:524:341:121:Times:121:Times:employment of 2-3 percent around a secular trend. It is thus unavoidable that the business cycle 
24:678:53595:25:25:89:527:316:121:Times:121:Times:spills  over  into  the  home,  shifting  gender  differences  in  the  mix  of  household  and  market  
24:679:53700:25:26:89:524:291:121:Times:121:Times:activities for the “representative agent.” Because it is very unlikely (Greenwood et al., 1995) that 
24:680:53801:26:27:89:525:265:121:Times:121:Times:there is a stronger than one-for-one substitution of home for market production, a business cycle

24:682:53947:8:16:126:344:230:42:Times:100:Times:19The regression describing the scatter in Figure 4a is: 
24:683:54004:16:11:90:405:214:100:Times:100:Times: Female Work – Male  Work = -20.11 + 191.9ScarceF , RBar2 = 0.42. 
24:684:54069:11:12:246:319:203:100:Times:100:Times:(11.06)  (55.95)  
24:685:54086:12:11:90:370:191:100:Times:100:Times:where ScarceF is the fraction of  women agreeing with the statement. 
24:686:54155:11:12:90:262:180:100:Times:100:Times:That describing the scatter in Figure 4b is: 
24:687:54200:12:11:126:404:168:100:Times:100:Times:Female Work – Male Work = -17.85 + 168.4ScarceM , RBar2 = 0.35. 
24:688:54264:11:12:243:316:157:100:Times:100:Times:(11.79) (56.08)  
24:689:54280:12:11:90:363:145:100:Times:100:Times:where ScarceM  is the fraction of  men agreeing with the statement. 
24:690:54348:11:12:89:525:134:100:Times:100:Times:Interestingly  the  relationship  is  steeper  and  tighter  to  women’s  attitudes  on  the  allocation  of  scarce  jobs  
24:691:54472:12:7:89:154:122:100:Times:100:Times:than to men’s.   
24:692:54489:7:16:125:524:115:42:Times:100:Times:20The evidence adduced in Burda et al (2006) for Germany, the Netherlands and Italy observed in 
24:693:54585:16:11:89:524:99:100:Times:100:Times:two different years with few changes in the structure of the time-diary surveys supports the conclusion that 
24:694:54694:11:12:89:524:88:100:Times:100:Times:iso-work holds at different phases of the business cycle. Across the 16 richer countries for which data are 
24:695:54802:12:11:89:524:76:100:Times:100:Times:presented in Figure 1 the correlation of the female-male difference in total work with the deviation of the 
24:696:54910:11:27:89:503:65:100:Times:100:Times:OECD standardized unemployment rate from its country-specific average from 1986-2004 is +0.0004. 
24:697:55007:27:0:90:312:38:144:Times:144:Times: 22
25:698:55009:0:25:90:524:709:121:Times:121:Times:downturn will reduce men’s total work effort. This is inconsistent with earlier theoretical work on 
25:699:55109:25:25:90:527:684:121:Times:121:Times:the  macroeconomics  of  total  labor  supply.  Average  women’s  market  hours  are  much  more  
25:700:55207:25:26:90:525:659:121:Times:121:Times:strongly procyclical than men’s, so iso-work must tend to render women’s home production time 
25:701:55301:26:25:90:525:633:121:Times:121:Times:countercyclical, relative to men and possibly even absolutely. Iso-work will generally increase the 
25:702:55401:25:25:90:526:608:121:Times:121:Times:elasticity  of  labor  supply  to  the  market  as  the  marginal  product  of  home  production  tapers  off  
25:703:55512:25:25:89:130:583:121:Times:121:Times:quickly.  
25:704:55522:25:26:90:528:558:121:Times:121:Times:  A  second  implication  is  linked  to  long-run  economic  development.  Our  evidence  
25:705:55613:26:25:89:525:532:121:Times:121:Times:documents a convergence of total work across gender with economic development. We show in 
25:706:55703:25:25:89:526:507:121:Times:121:Times:Section  5  that  this  convergence  can  derive  either  from  increasingly  gender-blind  assignment  to  
25:707:55811:25:26:89:524:482:121:Times:121:Times:reference clusters with strong norms, or from a convergence of gender wage-offer distributions to 
25:708:55909:26:25:89:526:456:121:Times:121:Times:a  common  one.  The  past  half  century  has  also  seen  secular,  albeit  slow  convergence  in  gender  
25:709:56018:25:25:89:526:431:121:Times:121:Times:wage  differentials.  These  two  phenomena  are  probably  related,  but  what  is  their  source?  Has  
25:710:56124:25:26:89:527:406:121:Times:121:Times:technical  change  augmented  female  market  production  relative  to  that  of  men?    Is  technical  
25:711:56229:26:25:90:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:change in home production generally labor-saving?  More likely, how have interactions of these 
25:712:56324:25:25:90:525:355:121:Times:121:Times:two  types  of  innovation  combined  to  generate  the  convergence  in  total  work  and  the  returns  to  
25:713:56434:25:25:90:527:330:121:Times:121:Times:market  work?    Examining  these  interactions  without  considering  gender  roles  (e.g.,  Ngai  and  
25:714:56539:25:26:90:527:305:121:Times:121:Times:Pissarides,  2006)  is  a  useful  first  step;  but  given  the  huge  differences  in  gender  roles  in  less  
25:715:56653:26:25:90:525:279:121:Times:121:Times:developed countries, it is likely that growth and development patterns can be understood better if 
25:716:56752:25:25:90:525:254:121:Times:121:Times:we take account of the convergence of total work and changes in the relative amounts of market 
25:717:56847:25:26:90:525:229:121:Times:121:Times:and household work accomplished by men and women. This is especially true if one considers the 
25:718:56942:26:25:90:525:203:121:Times:121:Times:different  roles  played  by  physical  and  intellectual  attributes  over  the  agricultural,  industrial  and  
25:719:57056:25:25:90:442:178:121:Times:121:Times:service-sector phases of economic development (Fourastié, 1949; Clark, 1940). 
25:720:57134:25:26:126:525:153:121:Times:121:Times:In household models we typically assume that a spouse’s bargaining power is a function 
25:721:57221:26:25:89:525:127:121:Times:121:Times:of her/his market earnings.  Yet we have shown here, at least for most rich economies, that gender 
25:722:57320:25:25:89:525:102:121:Times:121:Times:differences  in  the  amounts  of  leisure  consumed  are  tiny.    How  can  this  be  true  if,  as  is  still  the  
25:723:57439:25:39:89:525:77:121:Times:121:Times:case, men have substantially higher wage rates and market earnings?  Three logical possibilities 
25:724:57536:39:0:90:312:38:144:Times:144:Times: 23
26:725:57538:0:25:90:525:709:121:Times:121:Times:present themselves:  1) Men have more power, but are altruistic toward their spouses and toward 
26:726:57634:25:25:89:525:684:121:Times:121:Times:women generally, and do not take advantage of their relative power;21 2) Economists’ modeling 
26:727:57728:25:26:89:525:659:121:Times:121:Times:of the household has been incorrect, and market earnings do not generate power in the household; 
26:728:57825:26:25:89:525:633:121:Times:121:Times:or  3)  Earnings  do  generate  power,  men  are  not  altruistic,  but  the  average  man’s  utility  from  his  
26:729:57939:25:25:89:524:608:121:Times:121:Times:market and home work exceeds that of the average woman’s from the same total amount of work. 
26:730:58032:25:25:89:526:583:121:Times:121:Times:In  other  words,  iso-work  may  not  imply  iso-utility  from  the  same  amount  of  work.  This  last  
26:731:58139:25:26:89:525:558:121:Times:121:Times:possibility  implies  a  formal  version  of  what  is  implicit  in  the  writings  of  some  sociologists  who  
26:732:58253:26:25:89:524:532:121:Times:121:Times:have confronted the iso-work phenomenon (e.g., Mattingly and Bianchi, 2003), but then shifts the 
26:733:58350:25:25:89:526:507:121:Times:121:Times:discussion  to  why  one  type  of  work  is  more  onerous  than  another.    Why,  e.g.,  is  the  average  
26:734:58460:25:26:89:525:482:121:Times:121:Times:minute  spent  in  an  office  dealing  with  recalcitrant  colleagues  and  demanding  supervisors  more  
26:735:58567:26:25:89:480:456:121:Times:121:Times:pleasurable than the average minute spent shopping, cooking or taking care of children? 
26:736:58655:25:25:89:526:431:121:Times:121:Times:  A  social  norm  of  iso-work  imposes  restrictions  on  older  household  bargaining  models  
26:737:58753:25:26:89:527:406:121:Times:121:Times:(e.g.,  McElroy  and  Horney,  1981).    With  gender  equality  in  total  work,  the  only  room  for  
26:738:58858:26:25:89:525:380:121:Times:121:Times:changing  prices  and  threat  points  to  have  any  effect  on  choices  is  through  gender  differences  in  
26:739:58971:25:25:89:527:355:121:Times:121:Times:the  valuation  of  marginal  changes  in  time  spent  in  market  or  home  work.    While  these  are  
26:740:59077:25:25:89:528:330:121:Times:121:Times:possible,  their  implications  are  much  harder  to  trace  than  in  the  absence  of  an  iso-work  norm.    
26:741:59190:25:26:89:525:305:121:Times:121:Times:Consider too the choice of home versus market work, which is generally determined by equating 
26:742:59284:26:25:90:525:279:121:Times:121:Times:the marginal value product of household time to the real wage measured in terms of comparable 
26:743:59378:25:25:90:525:254:121:Times:121:Times:market output (e.g., Gronau, 1980). To the extent that social norms constrain agents to a value of 
26:744:59477:25:26:90:527:229:121:Times:121:Times:labor  supply  that  pays  little  attention  to  productivity  in  household  production,  one  or  more  
26:745:59584:26:115:90:508:203:121:Times:121:Times:efficiency conditions in the standard model of household behavior would need to be modified.
