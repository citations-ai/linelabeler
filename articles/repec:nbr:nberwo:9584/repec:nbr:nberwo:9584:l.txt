2:25:1110:29:18:71:540:581:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Many economists and educators of diverse political beliefs favor public support for education on the
2:26:1210:18:18:71:539:563:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:premise that a more educated electorate enhances the quality of democracy. While some earlier
2:27:1303:18:18:71:539:545:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:studies document an association between schooling and citizenship, little attempt has been made to
2:28:1401:18:18:71:539:527:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:address the possibility that unobservable characteristics of citizens underlie this relationship. This
2:29:1503:18:18:71:538:509:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:paper explores the effect of extra schooling induced through compulsory schooling laws on the
2:30:1596:18:18:71:539:491:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:likelihood  of  becoming  politically  involved  in  the  US  and  the  UK.  We  find  that  educational
2:31:1700:18:18:71:539:473:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:attainment is related to several measures of political interest and involvement in both countries. For
2:32:1802:18:18:71:539:455:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:voter turnout, we find a strong and robust relationship between education and voting for the US, but
2:33:1902:18:18:71:539:437:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:not for the UK. Using the information on validated voting, we find that misreporting of voter status
2:34:2002:18:18:71:539:419:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:can not explain our estimates. Our results suggest that the observed drop in voter turnout in the US
2:35:2102:18:18:71:540:401:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:from 1964 to 2000 would have been 10.4 to 12.3 percentage points greater if high school attainment
2:36:2200:18:18:71:540:383:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:had stayed at 1964 rates, holding all else constant. However, when we condition on registration, our
2:37:2300:18:18:71:539:365:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:US results approach the UK findings. This may indicate that registration rules present a barrier to
2:38:2399:18:46:71:246:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:low-educated citizens’ participation.

3:55:2821:31:20:115:512:641:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:The commonwealth requires the education of the people as the safeguard of order and
3:56:2904:20:20:99:131:621:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:C:liberty.

3:58:2974:28:20:88:539:573:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:A large body of research in the last 30 years shows that schooling has a significant private
3:59:3066:20:20:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:return in terms of increased earnings. Yet, it is possible that education creates other benefits to
3:60:3165:20:20:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:society that are not reflected in the earnings of the educated. One potentially important example
3:61:3262:20:20:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of such positive externalities of education is enhanced political behaviour. Economists, educators
3:62:3360:20:20:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and politicians commonly argue that one of the benefits of education is that a more educated
3:63:3452:20:20:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:electorate enhances the quality of democracy. If this is true, then education has social benefits over
3:64:3554:20:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and above the private return, and Pigouvian subsidies for education may produce more efficient
3:65:3648:20:20:72:222:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:education acquisition decisions.
3:66:3680:20:20:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Interestingly, the argument that education generates positive externalities through its effects
3:67:3775:20:20:72:539:393:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:on political behavior is not raised only by those who support a larger role for the government.1
3:68:3871:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The same argument resonates with noted advocates of a limited role for government, such as Adam
3:69:3966:20:28:72:420:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Smith and Milton Friedman.2For example, Friedman (1962) argues that
3:70:4033:28:20:115:512:325:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:“A stable and democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree of literacy
3:71:4116:20:20:99:513:305:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:and knowledge on the part of most citizens and without widespread acceptance of some
3:72:4200:20:20:99:513:285:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:common set of values. Education can contribute to both. In consequence, the gain from
3:73:4285:20:20:99:513:265:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:education of a child accrues not only to the child or to his parents but also to other
3:74:4371:20:20:99:513:245:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:members of the society. [...] Most of us would probably conclude that the gains are
3:75:4454:20:28:99:382:225:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:sufficiently important to justify some government subsidy.”
3:76:4513:28:20:88:539:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Why might education affect political behavior?  The benefit of education may accrue either
3:77:4603:20:15:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:through the enhanced quality of participation by a given subset of citizens, or through broader
3:78:4698:15:15:84:539:162:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:1For example, the Center on Education Policy, a liberal think thank that promotes public schools, argues that
3:79:4807:15:11:72:540:147:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:“The survival of a representative democracy like the United States ultimately depends on having a large group of
3:80:4919:11:11:72:540:136:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:well-educated citizens.” Schools prepare students to be good citizens in three ways: “(1) teach students about the
3:81:5033:11:11:72:540:125:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:role of government in the United States; (2) uphold civic values by teaching students to be good citizens; (3) equip
3:82:5149:11:7:72:470:114:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:students with the civic skills they need to be effective participants in a representative democracy”.
3:83:5250:7:14:84:539:107:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:2Smith (1776) emphasizes the benefits of increased cognitive capacity among the “common people”, claiming that
3:84:5360:14:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:“They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing through, the interested complaints of faction and
3:85:5472:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:sedition, and they are, upon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the
3:86:5585:11:0:72:176:71:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:measures of government.”
4:87:5610:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:participation among the citizenry. The first channel is important if education equips citizens with
4:88:5709:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the cognitive skills they need to be effective participants in a representative democracy. In this
4:89:5807:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:case, education increases citizens’ ability to select able leaders, understand the issues upon which
4:90:5907:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:they will vote, act as a check on the potential excesses of the government, and recognize corruption
4:91:6007:20:20:72:121:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in leaders.
4:92:6018:20:20:88:539:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The second channel is important if education improves citizens’ interest and knowledge of po-
4:93:6111:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:litical issues, their involvement in the political process and, ultimately, the effectiveness of their
4:94:6213:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:political participation. Economists commonly argue that education provides important social ben-
4:95:6309:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:efits through enhanced civic participation.  Hanushek (2002), among many others, makes this
4:96:6400:20:20:72:283:492:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:argument in his survey of public education.3
4:97:6444:20:19:88:539:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In our paper, we focus on this second channel. Although establishing the link between schooling
4:98:6539:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and the quality of political choices would be potentially more interesting, such a topic is hard to
4:99:6638:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:investigate empirically. We can think of no way to measure objectively the quality of decisions
4:100:6733:20:20:72:184:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:made by the electorate.
4:101:6756:20:20:88:539:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:We empirically test whether schooling improves civic participation in the United States and the
4:102:6851:20:20:72:539:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:United Kingdom, as measured by the probability of voting.4We also test whether more educated
4:103:6943:20:20:72:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voters have better information on candidates and campaigns.5Finally, we test whether education
4:104:7037:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:increases other measures of political participation, such as the probability of attending political or
4:105:7139:20:20:72:539:313:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:community meetings, working on community issues, and more in general, being politically active.6
4:106:7235:20:20:88:539:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:To account for unobserved characteristics of individuals that may affect both schooling and
4:107:7326:20:16:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:political participation, we use an instrumental variable strategy. We measure the effects of schooling
4:108:7428:16:15:84:539:257:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:3There are several theoretical models that suggest a link between education and civic participation. Verba and
4:109:7538:15:10:72:540:242:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:Nie (1972) argues that individuals with higher socioeconomic status may have higher cognitive skills, benefit from
4:110:7652:10:11:72:540:232:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the higher effectiveness of their participation, possess more knowledge about the issues, or be influenced by peer
4:111:7766:11:11:72:540:221:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:effects from other high SES individuals. It is also possible that skills acquired from additional schooling may help an
4:112:7885:11:11:72:540:210:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:individual overcome the bureaucratic inconveniences and difficulties in registering to vote (Wolfinger and Rosenstone
4:113:8002:11:11:72:540:199:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:(1980)). Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) develop a positive model in which low-education voters prefer to abstain
4:114:8116:11:11:72:540:188:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:so that the votes of better-informed voters will carry more weight. In their model the non-voting of the low-educated
4:115:8233:11:11:72:540:177:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:is a result of theirrelativelack of education— providing more education to them will only increase voting if the
4:116:8345:11:11:72:540:166:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:education level of the rest of society stands still. This approach contrasts with the emphasis in Verba and Nie (1972)
4:117:8463:11:7:72:355:155:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:and Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980)) onabsolutelevels of education.
4:118:8530:7:15:84:539:148:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:4Our focus on the United States and the United Kingdom derives from two reasons. First, both countries offer
4:119:8638:15:11:71:539:133:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:adequate microdata surveys to study the questions we ask. Second, our instrumental variable strategy requires clear,
4:120:8754:11:7:71:326:122:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:identifiable, and binding changes in compulsory schooling laws.
4:121:8817:7:11:84:417:115:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:5This evidence speaks, at least indirectly, to the issue of quality of political choice.
4:122:8905:11:15:84:539:104:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:6At a late stage in the preparation of our manuscript, we became aware of a similar paper to ours, Dee (2002).
4:123:9015:15:11:71:539:89:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:Although the data sources and some outcome variables are different, the question addressed by the paper is similar
4:124:9129:11:0:71:102:78:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:to ours.
5:125:9138:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:through changes in compulsory school laws across different regions at different times. The approach
5:126:9237:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:identifies the effect of schooling on citizenship from extending duration in school for would-be-
5:127:9334:20:20:72:117:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:dropouts.
5:128:9343:20:20:88:539:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:We find a strong effect of education on voting in the US. The effect appears largely to be
5:129:9433:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:accounted for by differences in voting registration across education groups. Results from the UK,
5:130:9530:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where persons are legally responsible and actively assisted to register, show little effect of education
5:131:9634:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on voting. We also find strong and persistent effects of education on civic behavior in both the
5:132:9730:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:US and the UK. Better educated adults are more likely to follow election campaigns in the media,
5:133:9826:20:20:72:513:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:discuss politics with others, associate with a political group, and work on community issues.
5:134:9919:20:20:88:539:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Misreporting is well known to be prevalent in voting turnout data. One concern is that our
5:135:10009:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:finding could simply reflect an higher probability of over-reporting voting among educated individ-
5:136:10108:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:uals. Using information on the validation of voting status of respondents based on official voting
5:137:10206:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:records, we directly test whether misreporting by survey respondents affects our conclusions on the
5:138:10305:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:relationship between voting and education. We conclude that misreporting is not systematically
5:139:10399:20:20:72:405:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:correlated with education and therefore does not affect our estimates.
5:140:10469:20:20:88:539:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Overall, our results for the US lend support to the argument that education generates positive
5:141:10563:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:externalities in the form of enhanced political behaviour.  Our findings indicate that education
5:142:10659:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:benefits a representative democracy both by increasing the quantity of citizens’ involvement in
5:143:10754:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the electoral process (increased probability of voting) as well as the quality of their involvement
5:144:10853:20:20:72:355:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(increased information on candidates and political parties).
5:145:10913:20:20:88:539:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Below, we begin by giving some background on registration and voting in the US and the UK
5:146:11002:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and describing the data sources we employ.  Sections 4 and 5 provide the empirical results for
5:147:11096:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voting and for other civic outcomes, respectively. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the
5:148:11193:20:34:72:199:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:implications of our results.
5:149:11221:34:31:72:266:179:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:2  Voting and Registration
5:150:11247:31:20:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:A vast body of empirical research in political science has studied civic participation. Verba and
5:151:11344:20:20:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Nie (1972) provides some of the first micro-empirical evidence of a strong link between socio-
5:152:11438:20:19:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:economic status (SES) and political participation. Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) break down
5:153:11531:19:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:SES into separate income and education effects and find the influence of education to be stronger
6:154:11629:0:20:72:539:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:than income.7Powell (1985) suggests that the SES-participation link is much stronger in the US
6:155:11723:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:than in other industrialized countries. An important weakness of the existing evidence lies in the
6:156:11821:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:treatment of causality. Lacking a strategy to address the potential endogeneity of schooling, the
6:157:11918:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:evidence available in the existing literature offers little firm evidence on the causal nature of the
6:158:12019:20:20:72:134:592:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:relationship.8
6:159:12033:20:20:88:539:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In order to understand the institutional context in which voting decisions are made, we provide
6:160:12128:20:20:72:442:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:some detail on voting and registration for each of the two countries we study.
6:161:12206:20:20:88:539:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The responsibility of registering to vote in the US rests mainly with the individual. Each state
6:162:12302:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:determines its own registration laws, subject to certain limitations imposed at the federal level.
6:163:12400:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:At the time our data was collected, most states required registering directly at specific regional
6:164:12498:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:offices, during particular hours. Some states required registering more than a month in advance
6:165:12593:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of an election, and some offices were open only during working hours (Wolfinger and Rosenstone
6:166:12687:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(1980)). Many states made it easier to register through the 1970s by allowing mail-in registration
6:167:12785:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and registration while renewing drivers’ licenses.  In 1993, the National Voter Registration Act
6:168:12881:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(commonly called the ‘motor-voter law’) was passed federally, mandating mail-in and agency-based
6:169:12977:20:20:72:189:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registration in all states.
6:170:13004:20:20:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:How does registration affect voting? Registration raises the costs of voting, and particularly
6:171:13098:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:affects those who find it difficult to deal with bureaucratic hurdles associated with the process.
6:172:13196:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Procrastinators may also be affected by registration, as voters must plan to vote well in advance.
6:173:13294:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:If the low-educated are less motivated or less able to overcome these barriers, then registration is
6:174:13394:20:20:72:354:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:predicted to adversely affect their voting turnout behavior.
6:175:13454:20:20:88:539:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Empirical analysis of these reforms suggest a modest effect on voter turnout. Knack (1995)
6:176:13544:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:analyzes the 1970s and 1980s variation in registration laws and finds a positive effect on registration,
6:177:13648:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and that about half of the new registrants vote. Martinez and Hill (1999) looks at the 1992 and 1996
6:178:13748:20:19:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:elections, finding little evidence of an impact of the 1993 federal motor-voter law. Highton (1997)
6:179:13847:19:16:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:compares states with high registration barriers to states with low barriers, finding that the effect of
6:180:13950:16:15:84:539:158:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:7Teixeira (1987), Leighley and Nagler (1992), and Weisberg and Box-Steffensmeier (1999) empirically demonstrate
6:181:14061:15:11:72:540:143:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the persistence of these effects through the 1980s and 1990s. Helliwell and Putnam (1999) study the effect of education
6:182:14180:11:11:72:540:132:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:on various measures of social engagement, finding that individual education has a much stronger affect than aggregate
6:183:14297:11:7:72:163:121:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:measures of education.
6:184:14319:7:15:84:539:114:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:8One exception is Brady et al. (1995), in which the authors examine the potential endogeneity of political interest
6:185:14434:15:11:72:540:99:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:using religious engagement, parents’ education, and other variables as instrumental variables.  However, it seems
6:186:14547:11:11:72:540:88:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:likely that these instruments could be related to unobserved heterogeneity in political activity; that they are jointly
6:187:14666:11:0:72:120:77:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:determined.
7:188:14678:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the barriers is modest, but hits harder among low-educated voters. Finally, Flanigan and Zingale
7:189:14774:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(2002) argues that if registration expansions lead to low-interest citizens becoming registered, little
7:190:14877:20:20:72:253:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:impact may be seen on voter turnout.
7:191:14913:20:20:88:539:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Unlike the United States, the responsibility to maintain the electoral register in Britain rests
7:192:15009:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:with local government officials.9As a consequence, only 5.9 percent of the British electorate are
7:193:15106:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:currently not registered.10The process for compiling the register explains this low fraction. Each
7:194:15204:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:year, Electoral Registration Officers update the register. A form is sent to every household in a
7:195:15301:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:region asking for the householder to indicate the names of all those in the household qualified to
7:196:15399:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:be included on the list. If a reply is not received a reminder is delivered and then a personal visit
7:197:15500:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:made to all households who have not returned at least one form. Although electors have the right
7:198:15596:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:not to vote, they incur a fine for failing to return a completed form or for giving false information.
7:199:15698:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The penalty was first imposed in 1918, with the current fine for this offence not exceeding 1000
7:200:15794:20:35:72:235:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:pounds (United Kingdom (2002)).
7:201:15825:35:31:72:131:398:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:3  Data
7:202:15832:31:19:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We examine voting behavior and other citizenship outcomes in the United States using the annual
7:203:15927:19:20:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:National Elections Studies and the November Current Population Surveys.  We use the British
7:204:16018:20:20:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:General Election Studies and the Eurobarometer Surveys for our UK analysis. Below, we describe
7:205:16112:20:20:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:these datasets. We also discuss the issue of measurement error in citizenship variables, and describe
7:206:16213:20:29:72:317:288:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:how we address this issue in the empirical analysis.
7:207:16265:29:27:72:180:259:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3.1  US Data sets
7:208:16282:27:20:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The two datasets we employ for the US complement each other in many ways.  Our primary
7:209:16368:20:20:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:source of data is the complete set of pooled biannual National Election Studies (NES) compiled
7:210:16462:20:20:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by Shapiro et al. (2001), spanning the period 1948 to 2000. These data are the premier source
7:211:16555:20:20:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for analysis of voting behavior in the United States, and are used regularly for empirical studies
7:212:16653:20:20:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by political scientists. The survey is collected with telephone and in-person interviews, before and
7:213:16753:20:20:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:after the election. The dataset pulls together demographic information on the respondent with
7:214:16846:20:16:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:a wide and deep variety of questions about political affiliations, voting behavior, knowledge, and
7:215:16944:16:11:84:465:96:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:9The responsibility dates back to the passage of the Representation of the People Act of 1918.
7:216:17038:11:0:80:392:85:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:10This figured is based on verified reports in the 1997 British Election Study.
8:217:17118:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attitudes. Importantly for our instrumental variables strategy, the survey reports the state in which
8:218:17219:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the respondent received his or her education. The sample size for the survey ranges from 662 in
8:219:17314:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1948 up to 2485 in 1992. We select only those individuals with valid responses to the variables we
8:220:17412:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:use. Since some questions weren’t asked in all years, the exact number of observations varies across
8:221:17512:20:20:72:138:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:specifications.
8:222:17527:20:20:88:539:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The key voting turnout measure we employ is formed from a question in the NES about voting
8:223:17617:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in the November elections. From 1978 on, the question in the survey was: “In talking to people
8:224:17711:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:about the election we often find that a lot of people weren’t able to vote because they weren’t
8:225:17806:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registered or they were sick or they just didn’t have time. How about you, did you vote in the
8:226:17900:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:elections this November?” The wording of the question changed only slightly through the time
8:227:17992:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:period we study. As well, no differentiation is made among votes for different offices that may be
8:228:18090:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:up for election on election day. From this question we form a binary variable for self-reported voter
8:229:18191:20:20:72:111:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:turnout.
8:230:18199:20:20:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:We complement our use of the NES with the 1994 to 2000 waves of the November voting
8:231:18282:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS allows us to form variables for
8:232:18372:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:being registered and having voted, but no broader citizenship measures.  While it reports the
8:233:18465:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:current state of residence, we do not observe the state in which the individual grew up. This means
8:234:18564:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that the assignment of school leaving laws must assume that there has been no migration since
8:235:18657:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:childhood.  We keep only those observations with valid responses to the variables we use.  The
8:236:18751:20:29:72:521:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:primary advantage of the CPS is its sample size, totalling 218,865 over the four waves we use.
8:237:18845:29:27:72:183:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3.2  UK Data sets
8:238:18862:27:20:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Two datasets comprise our sources for Great Britain. First, the British Election Studies (BES)
8:239:18956:20:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:collect data for describing and explaining the outcome of general elections.  The surveys have
8:240:19050:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:been taken immediately after every general election in Britain since 1964, as well as during two
8:241:19146:20:20:72:539:177:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:non-election years. We combine the survey years for 1964, 1974, 1979, 1983, 1987, 1992, and 1997.11
8:242:19245:20:20:88:539:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The combined dataset contains information on gender, age, age finished full-time education, and
8:243:19340:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voting behavior, with a total sample of 17,825 adults aged 18 or older, who reached age 14 between
8:244:19438:20:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1925 and 1990. The BES is the only study in the UK to ask a large sample of adults whether
8:245:19528:20:16:72:540:97:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:they voted or not during the past general election. As with the NES, for most of the survey years,
8:246:19626:16:0:80:412:81:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:11We omit the 1969 study for lack of a comparable education attainment variable.
9:247:19707:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:individuals were checked for the accuracy of their response on voting behavior by consulting actual
9:248:19806:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Electoral Register records. Verifying survey records with marked and unmarked Electoral Registers
9:249:19903:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:provides a rare opportunity to investigate response bias and, importantly, whether misreporting
9:250:19998:20:20:72:392:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:relates to education attainment or other observable characteristics.
9:251:20066:20:20:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Except for 1997, the BES is not a representative sample of the British population, but instead
9:252:20160:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:a sample of those on the electoral register and eligible to vote.  The sample is drawn from the
9:253:20255:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:register itself. Thus, results from the combined datasets are conditional on being in the register.
9:254:20354:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:An analysis using a nationally representative sample is possible using the 1997 BES. For 1997, the
9:255:20452:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample was drawn from a household address list rather than from the electoral register. Using this
9:256:20550:20:20:72:383:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:survey year only, however, reduces the total sample size to 3,390.
9:257:20616:20:19:88:539:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Our second source of UK data is the Eurobarometer survey. The Eurobarometers were first
9:258:20703:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:assembled in 1970 by the Commission of the European Community, and are designed to track
9:259:20791:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:opinions and attitudes among European citizens. Each nationally representative survey contains a
9:260:20887:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample of about 1,000 individuals from Britain, and 300 individuals from Northern Ireland. Surveys
9:261:20985:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:are carried out more than once a year, from 1973 to 1998. A total of 50 surveys are combined to
9:262:21080:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:create a dataset with 63,858 individuals who reached age 14 at some point between 1925 and 1990.
9:263:21176:20:20:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The Eurobarometers contain many questions on voting preferences and political activity. Re-
9:264:21267:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:spondents were interviewed and asked, “When you hold a strong opinion, do you ever find yourself
9:265:21363:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:persuading your friends, relatives, or fellow workers to share your views?” and, “When you get to-
9:266:21461:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:gether with friends, would you say you discuss political matters frequently, occasionally, or never?”
9:267:21562:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Interviewers also asked questions about how often respondents watch news on television or read a
9:268:21658:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:newspaper, and whether they consider themselves close to any particular party. The Eurobarome-
9:269:21752:20:20:72:522:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ters also collect demographic information on age, age finished full time education, and gender.
9:270:21847:20:20:88:539:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The Eurobarometers do not contain information on voter turnout, but they do contain a mul-
9:271:21937:20:19:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:titude of questions about political and citizenship activity. Another advantage is the inclusion of
9:272:22036:19:20:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Northern Ireland in the survey. Residents of Northern Ireland experienced the same changes in
9:273:22129:20:20:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the minimum school leaving law as did residents of Britain, but at different times. This allows
9:274:22224:20:20:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:identification of education effects through differences in the timing of minimum school-leaving age
9:275:22323:20:20:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:changes for the same birth cohort across the two parts of the United Kingdom. In contrast, with
9:276:22418:20:20:72:540:94:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the BES we identify the effects of education through school-leaving ages faced by different cohorts
9:277:22517:20:0:72:122:74:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in Britain.
10:278:22529:0:27:72:253:672:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:3.3  The issue of misreporting
10:279:22559:27:29:72:520:645:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We explore the effect of education on citizenship within the following econometric framework:
10:280:22652:29:28:247:540:616:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f6:A:Yit=β′Xit+γ′Qit+≤it,(1)
10:281:22675:28:20:72:539:588:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:whereYitrepresents an observed citizenship outcome (for example whether the respondent voted
10:282:22767:20:20:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in the last elections),Xitis a vector of observable characteristics,Qitis a vector of unobservable
10:283:22865:20:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics, and≤itis the error term.  The observed citizenship outcomeYitcan be further
10:284:22957:20:40:72:182:528:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:decomposed as follows:
10:285:22979:40:25:271:540:488:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f6:A:Yit=Y∗it+uit.(2)
10:286:22995:25:20:88:539:463:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The true value of the citizenship outcome isY∗itanduitis a measurement error term. If the
10:287:23084:20:20:72:539:443:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:measurement error is correlated withXit, then the estimate ofβwill be biased.  One source
10:288:23173:20:20:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of misreporting that could be correlated with schooling is the potential for embarrassment. For
10:289:23268:20:20:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:example, an individual might not wish to admit not having voted to those conducting the survey,
10:290:23363:20:19:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:so he or she offers an untruthful response in order to avoid embarrassment.  If misreporting is
10:291:23458:19:20:72:539:364:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:systematically related to educational attainment, then the estimate ofβwill be biased, as the
10:292:23551:20:20:72:540:344:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimatedβwill pick up the propensity to misreport rather than the true effect of education on

10:294:23650:20:20:88:539:304:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:While misreporting is a general problem for any empirical estimates based on survey data,
10:295:23739:20:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:misreporting is well-known to be prevalent in voting turnout data.12Although some degree of
10:296:23830:20:20:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:misreporting is likely to plague many surveys, there are very few examples of datasets where some
10:297:23927:20:20:72:540:244:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:form of exogenous data validation is available. One important feature of our data is the validation of
10:298:24029:20:20:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voting status of respondents using official voting records. With the information on validated voting,
10:299:24130:20:20:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:we can provide a direct analysis of misreporting. Specifically, in section 4 we directly test whether
10:300:24231:20:20:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:misreporting by survey respondents affects our conclusions on the relationship between voting and
10:301:24328:20:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:education.  We conclude that misreporting is not systematically correlated with education, and
10:302:24422:20:15:72:298:144:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:therefore our results on voting are not affected.
10:303:24471:15:15:80:539:129:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:12The political science literature on the correlation between misreporting and schooling important issue is mixed.
10:304:24585:15:10:72:540:114:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) conclude (p. 118) that “. . . misreporting is not strongly related to demographic
10:305:24698:10:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:characteristics.” Burden (2000) presents a recent analysis of misreporting bias, noting that “. . . many researchers
10:306:24814:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:find that replacing self-reported turnout with validated voter turnout in multivariate analyses does not change the
10:307:24929:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:substantive conclusion reached.” In contrast, Silver et al. (1986) and Leighley and Nagler (1992) find that among
10:308:25042:11:0:72:339:71:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:those not voting, misreporting is higher for high SES respondents.
11:309:25109:0:20:88:539:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:A second type of misreporting may be a problem for our broader indicators of civic participation.
11:310:25206:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Some of these outcomes are not connected with a specific action (voted/not voted), but describe
11:311:25301:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:subjective opinions of the respondent. For these outcomes, the absence of a pre-existing opinion may
11:312:25401:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:be another source of measurement error. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) explain that individuals
11:313:25498:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:may need to expend mental resources in order to form an opinion. Those who have not previously
11:314:25592:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:thought about an issue may therefore truthfully report a ‘wrong’ opinion; an unconsidered opinion
11:315:25689:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that might change upon further reflection. Again, if this type of ‘soft opinion’ measurement error is
11:316:25790:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:correlated with education, our estimate of the impact of education on citizenship outcomes would
11:317:25886:20:20:72:120:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:be biased.
11:318:25896:20:20:88:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f5:A:For the citizenship outcomes we study, we separate the results into the two categories ofactions
11:319:25992:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:andattitudes. We contend that soft-opinion bias is less likely to arise in response to questions about
11:320:26094:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:past actions than to questions about attitudes. This holds if fewer mental resources need to be
11:321:26189:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:expended in the recollection of past actions than in the formation of abstract opinions. To the extent
11:322:26291:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that the soft-opinion bias influences our estimates, we take greater caution in the interpretation of
11:323:26392:20:35:72:171:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the attitudes results.
11:324:26414:35:30:72:340:358:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:4  The Effect of Education on Voting
11:325:26450:30:20:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We now turn to the empirical evidence. We begin by looking at differences in the average probability
11:326:26550:20:20:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of voting by educational attainment, and subsequently extend the analysis to control for observable
11:327:26649:20:20:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and unobservable heterogeneity across education groups. In general, we find that in the US, more
11:328:26745:20:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:educated citizens appear to be more likely to vote, while this is not true in the UK. Furthermore,
11:329:26843:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:we show that the difference in voting probability across education groups that we uncover in the
11:330:26939:20:20:72:540:228:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:US is unlikely to be due to differential misreporting of voting status. Much of the estimated effect
11:331:27039:20:20:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of education on voting appears due to registration differences. We find that when we condition on
11:332:27136:20:20:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:being registered to vote, the remaining effect of schooling on voting in the US drops to less than a
11:333:27236:20:20:72:340:168:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:third of the estimated effect based on the whole sample.
11:334:27292:20:20:88:539:148:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Of course, the effect on citizenship may be through income if education increases lifetime earn-
11:335:27388:20:20:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ings. Any differences we uncover across educational attainment groups could be attributed to the
11:336:27484:20:19:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:higher income that resulted from more education, rather than to some direct component of educa-
11:337:27579:19:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tion. Our approach does not have the power to test among competing mechanisms that potentially
12:338:27675:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:explainhoweducation affects civic behavior. Instead, we focus on quantifying the magnitude and
12:339:27769:20:29:72:501:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:confirming the existence of the relationship, rather than identifying the exact mechanism.
12:340:27859:29:27:72:228:623:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:4.1  Unconditional Means
12:341:27883:27:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Table 1 analyzes differences in the self-reported probability of voting across education groups. The
12:342:27983:20:20:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:first column in the top panel indicates that, in the United States, individuals with more schooling
12:343:28082:20:20:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:are more likely to report having voted in the last election. While only 52 percent of U.S. high
12:344:28177:20:20:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:school dropouts report voting, this percentage increases to 67 percent for high school graduates, 74
12:345:28277:20:20:72:540:516:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:percent for individuals with some college and 84 percent for college graduates. These results are
12:346:28374:20:20:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:consistent with previous findings in the political science literature. Interestingly, when we include
12:347:28475:20:20:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:only individuals who are registered to vote (column 2), the differences in voting rates across groups
12:348:28576:20:20:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significantly decline. For example the difference in the probability of voting between high school
12:349:28674:20:20:72:540:436:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:drop outs and high school graduates is 15 percentage points in the full sample, but drops to 5
12:350:28768:20:20:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:percentage points in the sample of registered voters. Similarly, the difference in the probability
12:351:28866:20:20:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of voting between high school drop outs and college graduates is 32 percentage points in the full
12:352:28963:20:20:72:419:376:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample, but only 10 percentage points in the sample of registered voters.
12:353:29036:20:19:88:539:356:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The self-reported probabilities of voting in column 1 are higher than official turnout rates in
12:354:29131:19:20:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:recent elections. There are two reasons why the self-reported voting probabilities appear to be so
12:355:29229:20:20:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:high. First, they are based on every general election since 1948. While turnout rates are currently
12:356:29328:20:20:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:low, they used to be significantly higher in the 1950s and 1960s. For example, the turnout rate in the
12:357:29430:20:20:72:540:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1960 presidential election was 63 percent, while the turn out rate in the 1996 presidential election
12:358:29530:20:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was only 49 percent. The second reason is misreporting. Some respondents may be reluctant to
12:359:29622:20:20:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:admit that they did not vote. If the probability of misreporting is random across individuals, it
12:360:29719:20:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:will reduce the precision of our estimates, but it will not bias our estimates. On the other hand,
12:361:29817:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:it is possible that more educated individuals are more likely to feel the stigma of not having voted
12:362:29917:20:20:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and therefore are more likely to over-report voting. In this case, the strong relationship between
12:363:30015:20:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:schooling and voting documented in column 1 could simply reflect differences across education
12:364:30108:20:20:72:270:137:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:groups in the probability of misreporting.
12:365:30150:20:20:88:539:117:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:One strength on the NES is that, for a selected number of years, the voting status of respondents
12:366:30247:20:16:72:540:97:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was validated using official voting records.13Voting and registration records were checked in the
12:367:30344:16:0:80:515:81:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:13Specifically, vote validation studies were conducted in 1964, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990.
13:368:30455:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:jurisdiction in which the respondent was living when the survey was conducted. For those who were
13:369:30552:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registered outside the current jurisdiction of residence, attempts to contact the proper jurisdiction
13:370:30653:20:20:72:173:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by phone were made.
13:371:30672:20:20:88:539:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:With the vote validation variables, we are therefore in the rare position of being able to test
13:372:30767:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:whether misreporting by survey respondents affects our conclusions.  In particular, we can test
13:373:30862:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:whether more educated individuals are more likely to over-report voting participation. Columns 3
13:374:30958:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and 4 show the validated probability of reporting, using the subsample of years in which responses
13:375:31056:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:were validated. The same positive gradient of voting with education appears in the validated data.
13:376:31154:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:This suggests that misreporting may not be correlated with education in our data. To examine this
13:377:31251:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:more directly, we show in Columns 5 and 6 the probability of misreporting by education group.
13:378:31344:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We create a misreporting dummy, which is equal to 1 if the respondent reports having voted and
13:379:31438:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:official records indicated that she did not vote, or if the respondent reports not having voted and
13:380:31537:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:official records indicated that she did vote.  The great majority of misreporting cases are cases
13:381:31634:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where respondents report having voted and official records indicate that they actually did not vote.
13:382:31734:20:20:88:539:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Column 5 shows that, if anything, more educated individuals are slightlylesslikely to misreport.
13:383:31830:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The probability of misreporting is between 18 to 20 percent for high school dropouts, high school
13:384:31927:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:graduates, and individuals with some college. For college graduates, the misreporting rate drops to
13:385:32026:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:14 percent. A similar finding emerges from column 6, where we show the probability of misreporting
13:386:32124:20:20:72:170:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for registered voters.
13:387:32146:20:20:88:539:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:From this analysis, we conclude that, although misreporting is not uncommon in our sample,
13:388:32236:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:it is unlikely to introduce any significant upward bias in our estimates of the effect of schooling
13:389:32335:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on voting participation. If validated information on voting were available for all the elections, we
13:390:32435:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:would use the validated information instead of the self-reported data. However, validated voting
13:391:32531:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is available only for a limited number of years. For this reason, throughout the paper we use self-
13:392:32630:20:19:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:reported voting as our preferred dependent variable, although later in the paper we also show that
13:393:32728:19:20:72:383:174:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:our results don’t change much if validated voting is used instead.
13:394:32794:20:20:88:539:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The bottom panel in Table 1 shows similar conditional means for the UK. The comparison
13:395:32880:20:20:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between UK and US data is complicated by the fact that our UK data report the age when the
13:396:32970:20:20:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:respondent finished school. This variable for educational achievement has the advantage, however,
13:397:33067:20:20:72:455:94:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that it can be matched closely with changes to the minimum school leaving age.
13:398:33145:20:0:88:539:74:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:There is much less discrepancy in voting patterns between the population sample (using only the
14:399:33242:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1997 BES) and the registered sample (using the combined BES). The fraction voting is somewhat
14:400:33335:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:U-shaped by education level. 85 percent of the British electorate who finished school at age 14
14:401:33430:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:reports voting in the last general election survey. The proportion reporting they voted falls slightly
14:402:33532:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:below 80 percent for those who finished school between ages 15 and 17, and the proportion of British
14:403:33632:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that finished school past age 17 increases to 84 percent. In the UK, like in most European countries,
14:404:33733:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:all citizens are registered and required to vote. Conditioning on registration, therefore, does not
14:405:33832:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significantly change the fraction of the population voting. For registered voters who finished school
14:406:33933:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:at age 14 or earlier, the voting rate is 88 percent. The corresponding figures for those who finished
14:407:34034:20:20:72:445:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:school at 15, 16 17 and 18 or more are 85, 83, 87 and 88 percent, respectively.
14:408:34113:20:20:88:539:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Similar to the US, the probability of misreporting does not appear to be systematically corre-
14:409:34207:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lated with schooling achievement. The fraction misreporting ranges from 13 to 18 percent across
14:410:34302:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:education categories for the full (1997) sample. The actual fraction of the British electorate that
14:411:34401:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:vote is distributed about the same across education groups as the self-reported fraction, ranging
14:412:34498:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between 62 percent for those finishing school at age 16 and 69 percent for those finishing school at
14:413:34598:20:20:72:139:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:age 14 or less.
14:414:34613:20:20:88:539:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Although we don’t report the figures in the table, a similar picture emerges if one looks at
14:415:34705:20:20:72:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Canadian data.14In Canada, the probability of voting is 0.83 for high school drop outs, 0.84
14:416:34797:20:20:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for high school graduates, 0.86 for individuals with some post-high school education and 0.90 for
14:417:34894:20:20:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:university graduates. The registration process resembles more closely that in Britain than the US,
14:418:34992:20:20:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:adding to our suggestive evidence that the relationship between education and voting has most to
14:419:35088:20:20:71:539:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:do with the relationship between education and electoral registration.15In the remainder of the
14:420:35183:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:paper, we focus on US and UK, as our instrumental variables work best in these two countries.
14:421:35276:20:29:72:349:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:However, we do refer to OLS estimates for Canada below.
14:422:35331:29:27:72:296:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:4.2  Evidence from the United States
14:423:35367:27:20:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:In the previous section we showed that more educated individuals are more likely to vote in the US.
14:424:35466:20:16:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:However, this documented correlation between schooling and voting might not be causal. There are
14:425:35562:16:15:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:14We pooled together the Canadian Election Studies from 1988, 1993, 1997, and 2000, using the same variables as
14:426:35673:15:7:72:412:126:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:we used for the US. The total number of observations with valid variables was 8044.
14:427:35756:7:14:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:15Since 1982 Canadians can register to vote by checking a box on their individual tax return form (that almost
14:428:35866:14:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:every adult must file each year). Prior to an election, a postcard is delivered to each household confirming registration
14:429:35987:11:11:72:540:94:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:and showing where to vote. Electors who did not receive a card can phone to be placed on the list. Elections Canada
14:430:36102:11:0:72:281:83:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:established a permanent register of electors in 1997.
15:431:36157:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:many individual characteristics that affect both schooling achievement and political participation,
15:432:36256:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:creating spurious correlation. In the next two sections, we turn to a more formal analysis of the
15:433:36353:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:relationship between education and voting, and we try to account for observable and unobservable
15:434:36449:20:29:72:434:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:individual characteristics that may be correlated with schooling and voting.
15:435:36525:29:27:72:289:583:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f14:C:4.2.1  National Election Survey results
15:436:36564:27:20:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Table 2 shows OLS regressions based on NES data. The independent variable of primary interest
15:437:36657:20:20:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is a dummy equal to one if the respondent has a high school education or more. The first column
15:438:36752:20:20:72:540:516:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:indicates that after conditioning on year effects and a fourth order polynomial in age, the difference
15:439:36854:20:20:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in the probability of voting between high school drop outs and individuals with 12 or more years
15:440:36950:20:20:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of schooling is 21 percentage points. When we include race and gender (column 2), this difference
15:441:37047:20:19:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:increases to 28 percentage points. When we also control for state of birth effects (column 3) and
15:442:37144:19:20:72:411:437:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:linearly for the year of birth of the respondent, the coefficient is 0.25.16
15:443:37220:20:20:88:539:417:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Columns 5 to 8 report estimates from similar models obtained by including only individuals
15:444:37310:20:20:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:who are registered to vote. Consistent with our findings in Table 1, conditioning on registration
15:445:37407:20:20:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significantly reduces the coefficient for high school graduation. The most robust specification in
15:446:37505:20:20:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:column 8 suggests that the difference in the probability of voting between high school dropouts
15:447:37600:20:20:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and individuals with 12 or more years of schooling is 9 percentage points, or about a third of the
15:448:37698:20:20:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:corresponding coefficient in column 4. These results are consistent with existing evidence that finds
15:449:37799:20:20:72:503:297:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the effect of education on turnout diminishes among the registered (e.g. Highton (1997)) .
15:450:37889:20:20:88:539:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Note that the information on registration is missing in some years, so that the sample used
15:451:37980:20:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in columns 1 to 4 is different from the sample used in columns 5 to 8. To make sure that the
15:452:38072:20:20:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:documented difference in results is not driven by differences in the sample, we re-estimate the
15:453:38167:20:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:models in column 1 to 4 using only the years when information on registration is available. We
15:454:38261:20:19:72:424:197:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:find results that are very similar to the ones reported in columns 1 to 4.17
15:455:38337:19:20:88:539:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:It is possible that our OLS estimates are biased by unobserved characteristics that are associated
15:456:38435:20:16:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:with schooling and outcomes. For example, parents who encourage their children to pursue more
15:457:38528:16:15:80:539:142:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:16For all regressions in the paper when we control for the year of birth, we use a linear term rather than year of
15:458:38642:15:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:birth dummies. In the CPS, both the OLS and the IV results are robust to the inclusion of a set of year of birth
15:459:38754:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:dummy variables. However, in the NES, the small sample sizes weaken the power of the instruments in the presence
15:460:38866:11:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:of a set of year of birth dummies. To maintain comparability, we control linearly for year of birth effects across all
15:461:38984:11:7:72:153:94:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:the datasets we use.
15:462:39004:7:15:80:539:87:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:17For example, the coefficient on high school graduation for the model in column 4 estimated using only the years
15:463:39117:15:0:72:310:72:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:when information on registration is available is 0.28 (0.13).
16:464:39180:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:education might also nurture strong civic values. If so, the unobserved parental influence could
16:465:39276:20:20:72:423:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lead to a positive bias in the estimate of the effect of schooling on voting.
16:466:39353:20:20:88:539:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:One potential solution to this problem is to find a set of instrumental variables that are related
16:467:39451:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to voting only through their impact on schooling. We use mandatory schooling laws as instru-
16:468:39543:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ments.18States changed their mandatory schooling laws at different times, generating variation
16:469:39637:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:across cohorts and jurisdictions in exposure to the laws. If this variation leads to higher educa-
16:470:39735:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tional attainment, but is unrelated to citizenship outcomes, then mandatory schooling laws are
16:471:39829:20:20:72:158:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:valid instruments.
16:472:39847:20:20:88:539:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Years of compulsory attendance are defined as the maximum between (i) the minimum number
16:473:39935:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of years that a child is required to stay in school and (ii) the difference between the earliest age
16:474:40035:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that he is required to be in school and the latest age he is required to enroll. Child labor laws are
16:475:40136:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:defined as the earliest grade in which children are allowed to leave school to enter the labor market.
16:476:40238:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:In the years relevant for our sample, 1914 to 1990, states changed compulsory attendance levels
16:477:40333:20:20:72:539:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and child labor laws several times, and not always upward.19We assign compulsory attendance
16:478:40424:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:laws and child labor laws to individuals on the basis of state of residence at age 14 and the year
16:479:40522:20:20:72:259:373:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:when the individual was 14 years old.20
16:480:40561:20:20:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The effect of compulsory schooling laws and child labor laws on schooling is well documented (see
16:481:40658:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for example Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), Lochner and Moretti (2001) and Lleras-Muney (2002b)).
16:482:40752:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Increases in compulsory schooling and in child labor laws have been shown to affect educational
16:483:40847:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attainment, controlling for state and year of birth. Our first stage estimates are consistent with
16:484:40945:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:findings in the existing literature. The top panel in Table 3 quantifies the effect of compulsory
16:485:41042:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attendance laws and child labor laws on educational achievement in the NES. For compulsory
16:486:41132:20:16:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attendance laws, we create four indicator variables, depending on whether years of compulsory
16:487:41225:16:14:80:539:217:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:18This type of instrument has been used previously by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) to study the social return to

16:491:41601:7:15:80:539:174:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:19The most dramatic examples of downward changes are South Carolina and Mississippi, who repealed their
16:492:41704:15:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:compulsory attendance statutes following the forced integration of schools in order to avoid requiring white children
16:493:41821:11:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:to attend racially mixed schools. Within the following decade, South Carolina re-enacted a compulsory attendance
16:494:41933:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:statute, although it was weakened by provisions making the statute a mere enabling act which could be utilized at
16:495:42046:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:local option (Kotin and Aikman (1980)). See Lochner and Moretti (2001) for more details on changes in compulsory
16:496:42158:11:7:72:132:115:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:schooling laws.
16:497:42173:7:15:80:539:108:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:20The data sources for compulsory attendance laws are given in Appendix B of Acemoglu and Angrist (2000). We
16:498:42281:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:use the same cut off points as Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) and Lochner and Moretti (2001). We experimented with
16:499:42392:11:0:72:473:82:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:a matching based on the year the individual is age 16 or 17, and found qualitatively similar results.

17:501:42589:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:variables, depending on whether the minimum number of years of school before work is permitted
17:502:42683:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is 6 or less, 7, 8, and 9 or more. All models include controls for age, election year, state of birth,
17:503:42785:20:20:72:164:612:11:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:and year of birth.21
17:504:42805:20:20:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Identification of the estimates comes fromchangesover time in the number of years of compul-
17:505:42897:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sory education or child labor laws in any given state. The identifying assumption is that conditional
17:506:42998:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on state of birth, cohort of birth and election year, the timing of the changes in compulsory at-
17:507:43095:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tendance laws within each state is orthogonal to characteristics of individuals that affect voting,
17:508:43194:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:like family background or tastes. Columns 1 to 3 indicate that, in general, the more stringent the
17:509:43292:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:compulsory attendance legislation or the child labor law legislation, the higher is the probability
17:510:43391:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of high school graduation. For example, individuals who were 14 in states and years requiring 11
17:511:43487:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:or more years of compulsory attendance, are 7.5 percentage points more likely to have at least
17:512:43581:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:high school compared with individuals who were 14 in states/years requiring 8 years or less (the
17:513:43677:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:excluded case). (The relationship between high school graduation and compulsory schooling is not
17:514:43773:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:perfectly monotonic, possibly because there are few individuals in the state years where compulsory
17:515:43872:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:schooling is equal to 10). Similarly, individuals who were 14 in states and years requiring 9 or more
17:516:43973:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:years of schooling before work are 8.5 percentage points more likely to have at least high school
17:517:44070:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:compared with individuals who were 14 in states/years requiring 6 years or less (the excluded case).
17:518:44170:20:20:88:539:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Are compulsory schooling laws valid instruments? We start to address this question by asking
17:519:44262:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:whether increases in compulsory schooling ages are associated with changes in political attitudes
17:520:44359:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that may affect voter turnout.  If increases in mandatory schooling correspond with increases
17:521:44452:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in political participation, IV estimates might be too large. Similarly, changes in schooling laws
17:522:44549:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:may be correlated with civil rights changes that made registration easier.  However, we do not
17:523:44643:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:believe this to be a serious problem. In contrast to most studies using state policy changes as an
17:524:44741:20:19:72:539:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:instrument,simultaneouschanges in compulsory schooling laws and changes in political attitudes
17:525:44835:19:20:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:are not necessarily problematic for the instrument in this study, since we examine voting behavior
17:526:44933:20:20:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:among individuals many years after schooling laws. Recall that we assign compulsory attendance
17:527:45027:20:20:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:based on the year an individual is age 14, and our sample only includes individuals ages 20 and
17:528:45122:20:16:72:540:114:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:older. For the instrument to be invalid, changes in state political attitudes that take place when
17:529:45220:16:15:80:539:98:6:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f9:F:21More precisely, we include a dummy if the voter is female, a dummy if the respondent is black, a linear trend in
17:530:45334:15:11:72:540:83:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:year of birth, a four term polynomial in age, dummies for each election year, and dummies for each state of birth.
17:531:45448:11:0:72:440:72:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:The standard errors we use allow for clustering at the state of birth and year of birth level.
18:532:45544:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:an individual is age 14 must directly affect her voting behavior years later. In general, this does
18:533:45643:20:20:72:235:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:not appear to be a likely scenario.
18:534:45678:20:20:88:539:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Another important concern with using compulsory attendance laws as an instrument is that
18:535:45766:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the cost of adopting more stringent versions of the laws may be lower for states that expect faster
18:536:45865:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:increases in high school graduation rates. It is, therefore, possible that changes in compulsory atten-
18:537:45968:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:dance laws simply reflect underlying state-specific trends in graduation rates. This issue has been
18:538:46067:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:extensively examined by previous research, which has shown that changes in compulsory school-
18:539:46160:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ing laws do not appear to simply picking up underlying trends in education. Stricter compulsory
18:540:46255:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attendance laws appear to raise education, not vice versa. (See Lochner and Moretti (2001) and
18:541:46349:20:20:72:180:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Lleras-Muney (2002b).
18:542:46370:20:19:88:539:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The bottom of Table 3 reports instrumental variable estimates of the effect of high school
18:543:46460:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:graduation on voting. Column 1 uses only compulsory schooling laws as instruments, column 2
18:544:46551:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:uses only child labor laws, and column 3 uses both.  Irrespective of the instruments used, the
18:545:46645:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:IV estimates are very similar to OLS estimates. The IV coefficient on high school graduation is
18:546:46740:20:20:72:517:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between 0.28 and 0.30, statistically indistinguishable from the corresponding OLS coefficient.

18:548:46930:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:information was not recorded for many of the national election surveys, and the sample is therefore
18:549:47029:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significantly smaller. IV estimates appear to be generally lower than the corresponding estimates
18:550:47126:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for the full sample, but the large standard errors make it hard to draw firm conclusions. In the
18:551:47222:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:next section we show more precise results based on the larger sample available in the CPS. With
18:552:47317:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the CPS, we can confirm that IV estimates for registered voters is indistinguishable from zero.
18:553:47412:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Finally, when we re-estimate the models in column 1 to 3 using only the years when information
18:554:47506:20:28:72:499:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on registration is available, we find results similar to the ones reported in columns 1 to 3.
18:555:47599:28:27:72:300:205:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f14:C:4.2.2  Current Population Survey results
18:556:47639:27:20:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We now turn to an alternative data source, the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS has
18:557:47730:20:20:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the advantage that its sample size is many times larger than the NES, and therefore can in theory
18:558:47827:20:20:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:produce more precise estimates. The main disadvantage of the CPS is that it does not report the
18:559:47922:20:20:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:state of residence at age 14, nor the state of birth. As a consequence, we need to rely on the current
18:560:48024:20:20:72:540:98:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:state of residence to assign compulsory schooling laws and child labor laws. This may be a problem
18:561:48122:20:0:72:275:78:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:if current state of residence is endogenous.
19:562:48168:0:20:88:539:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Results based on the CPS are reported in Table 4, and in general confirm those based on NES
19:563:48259:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:data. Column 1 shows that OLS and IV estimates for the entire sample are, respectively, 0.29 and
19:564:48355:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:0.34, only slightly larger than the corresponding NES estimates. When we condition on the sample
19:565:48451:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of registered voters, the IV coefficient drop to virtually 0. Because the sample here is larger, the
19:566:48551:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:standard error for the IV estimates is half of the corresponding standard error in Table 3. This
19:567:48647:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:result is strong and important, as it confirms the suggestions in the existing literature about the
19:568:48746:20:29:72:266:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:effect of education among the registered.
19:569:48787:29:27:72:236:523:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:4.3  Evidence from the UK
19:570:48812:27:20:72:540:496:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The US results seem to indicate that the positive effect of schooling on voting may be driven largely
19:571:48913:20:20:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by the effect of schooling on registration. The IV results, in particular, imply that youth obliged to
19:572:49015:20:20:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attain additional education are much more likely to register to vote, and somewhat more likely to
19:573:49112:20:20:72:540:436:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:vote after becoming registered. As discussed in section 2, the responsibility of registering to vote in
19:574:49215:20:20:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the US, during the period when our data were collected, rests with the individual. In contrast, the
19:575:49314:20:20:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:responsibility in Britain rests with regional electoral officers who send letters and visit households
19:576:49416:20:20:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in order to complete the electoral register. Given the substantial differences in the registration
19:577:49514:20:19:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:process between the two countries, we may also expect to see differences in our estimates of the
19:578:49610:19:20:72:222:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:effect from schooling on voting.
19:579:49642:20:20:88:539:317:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:OLS estimates for Britain in column 2 in Table 5 indicate that an extra year of schooling has a
19:580:49737:20:20:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:small but significant effect on probability of voting. Controlling for registration does not alter the
19:581:49839:20:20:72:540:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimates by much, which is not surprising considering most British are registered and that there
19:582:49936:20:20:72:420:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:exists little association between registration and education (see Table 1).
19:583:50011:20:20:88:539:237:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:A comparison with US data is complicated by the fact that the UK data does not allow us
19:584:50098:20:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to create a dummy for high school graduation. If we assume that in the US the difference in the
19:585:50193:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:number of years of schooling completed by those with less than high school and those with a high
19:586:50289:20:20:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:school degree or more is about 4 years, the coefficient for the UK appears to be six times smaller
19:587:50387:20:20:72:220:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:than the coefficient for the US.
19:588:50419:20:20:88:539:137:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The IV results for Britain are presented in Table 6. The first stage results are presented in the
19:589:50516:20:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:upper part of the table. Although there were only two school-leaving age changes in Britain from
19:590:50612:20:19:72:540:97:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1920 to 1995, both changes were remarkably influential in raising school attainment (see Figures 1
19:591:50710:19:0:72:540:78:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and 2). A particularly large fraction of British leave school as soon as possible, relative to other
20:592:50812:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:industrialized countries.  The 1947 change in the school-leaving age, from 14 to 15, raised the
20:593:50907:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:average age before leaving by 0.51, as indicated in column 2 (recall that a linear control for birth
20:594:51007:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:cohort is also included in this regression). Relative to those who faced a drop out age of 14, the
20:595:51105:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:coefficient of 0.93 on age 16 indicates British youth facing a minimum school leaving age of 16
20:596:51200:20:20:72:320:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:attain almost a full year more of school, on average.
20:597:51253:20:20:88:539:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Similar to the OLS results, the IV estimates in Table 6 suggest a weak effect of schooling on
20:598:51346:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voting in Britain. The nationally representative sample is too small to derive precise conclusions
20:599:51444:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:from the results in column 1. But the estimates from using the BES datasets that were compiled
20:600:51538:20:20:72:352:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:from the electoral registry are very small and insignificant.
20:601:51599:20:20:88:539:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:While not shown in a table, OLS estimates based on Canadian data are qualitatively closer
20:602:51688:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to UK estimates than US ones. In particular, we find that the difference in probability of voting
20:603:51785:19:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between high school drop outs and individuals with at least a high school diploma or more is only
20:604:51882:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:9.1 percentage points, after controlling for a quartic in age, sex, language, year effects, province
20:605:51982:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:effects, and year of birth effects. When this estimate is compared with the one in column 4 of Table
20:606:52082:20:29:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:2, it indicates that the effect of high school graduation in Canada is about a third that of the US.
20:607:52182:29:27:72:295:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:4.4  Misreporting of Voting Behavior
20:608:52218:27:20:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:In Table 7 we provide more evidence that differential misreporting does not affect our estimates.
20:609:52315:20:20:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The first row reports for convenience our baseline estimates for the US, based on the full sample
20:610:52412:20:20:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of respondents (these coefficients are taken from Table 2, column 4 and Table 3, column 3). In
20:611:52506:20:20:72:540:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:row 2 and 3, we re-estimate the same model including only individuals whose voting status has
20:612:52599:20:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:been verified and confirmed using official voting records. Only a third of voting records have been
20:613:52698:20:20:72:456:237:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:verified, so the sample used in row 1 differ from the sample used in row 2 and 3.
20:614:52779:20:20:88:539:217:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In row 2, the dependent variable is the self-reported probability of voting.  In row 3, the
20:615:52870:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:dependent variable is the verified probability of voting. The comparison between OLS estimates
20:616:52964:20:20:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in row 1 and 2 indicates that the coefficient on high school graduation is slightly smaller in the
20:617:53062:20:20:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:smaller sample for which we have validated data. More importantly, the comparison between OLS
20:618:53155:20:20:72:540:137:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimates in row 2 and 3 confirms that misreporting does not significantly bias OLS estimates.
20:619:53249:20:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:They point estimates are similar: 0.021 for the self-reported voting and 0.18 for the verified voting.
20:620:53351:20:19:88:539:97:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In row 4, we regress a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respondent misreport her voting status
20:621:53445:19:0:72:540:78:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on the high school graduation dummy and all the other controls. Consistent with the results in
21:622:53541:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:column 4 of Table 1, the estimate in row 4 confirm that misreporting is mostly orthogonal to high
21:623:53638:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:school graduation. IV estimates in row 3 indicate that our results hold when verified voting status is
21:624:53740:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:used instead of self-reported voting status. However, the reduced sample size results in less precise
21:625:53841:20:20:72:305:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimates, making the comparison more difficult.
21:626:53889:20:20:88:539:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The bottom panel repeats the same exercise for the British data. The findings also confirm that
21:627:53984:20:34:72:444:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:misreporting does not appear to introduce any measurable bias in the results.
21:628:54061:34:31:72:447:538:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:5  The Effect of Education on Citizenship Outcomes
21:629:54111:31:20:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The empirical analysis so far has focused on participation in the political system as measured
21:630:54205:20:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by probability of voting. In this section, we extend our analysis to other measures of citizenship
21:631:54303:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes. For example, we look at whether and how voters obtain information about the candi-
21:632:54395:20:20:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:dates. One important potential channel through which education may improve citizenship is by
21:633:54487:20:20:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:raising citizens’ ability and interest in obtaining information about candidates and campaigns. An-
21:634:54586:20:20:72:540:407:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:other potential channel through which education may improve citizenship is by increasing citizens’
21:635:54684:20:20:72:459:387:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:involvement in community issues and their participation in community meetings.
21:636:54762:20:19:88:539:367:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The NES provides information on two sets of citizenship outcomes for the US. First, respondents
21:637:54857:19:20:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:were asked questions on actions that they have taken, such has whether they have followed the
21:638:54950:20:20:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:campaign on newspapers or television, or whether they regularly attend community meetings.
21:639:55040:20:20:72:527:308:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Second, the NES collects more subjective data on respondent attitudes on the political system.
21:640:55134:20:20:88:539:288:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The top panel of Table 8 reports OLS and IV estimates of the effect of high school graduation
21:641:55227:20:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on action outcomes. Because not all the questions were asked in all years, the sample size varies
21:642:55324:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:considerably across outcomes. As a consequence, IV estimates in some cases are not informative,
21:643:55419:20:20:72:450:228:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:because there are simply too few observations for the first stage to be effective.
21:644:55501:20:20:88:539:208:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Generally, the effect of education on these outcomes is to improve citizenship, when citizenship
21:645:55597:20:20:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is measured by the available action outcomes. High school graduates, relative to dropouts, are more
21:646:55696:20:20:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:likely to be registered, follow campaigns on television or newspapers, follow public affairs, attend
21:647:55796:20:20:72:472:148:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:political meetings, volunteer for community issues and attend community meetings.
21:648:55877:20:20:88:539:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The bottom panel of Table 8 focuses on more subjective measures of the respondents’ attitudes.
21:649:55971:20:19:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:More educated individuals are more likely to report that they are interested in elections, they don’t
21:650:56072:19:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:mind jury duty, that they are more likely to trust the Federal government and less likely to think
22:651:56172:0:20:72:231:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that Federal officials are crooked.
22:652:56207:20:20:88:539:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Table 9 uses the combined Eurobarometer surveys to estimate similar effects of schooling on
22:653:56298:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:citizenship outcomes for the UK (with samples from both Britain and Northern Ireland).  As
22:654:56388:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:with the BES results above, we find no relationship between registration and schooling. Among
22:655:56481:20:20:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:respondents, 92 percent say their name is on the electoral list for the next general election. The
22:656:56579:20:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:OLS and IV estimates of the effect of age left full-time education are insignificantly different from
22:657:56680:20:20:72:94:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:zero.
22:658:56685:20:20:88:539:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Least squares estimates indicate a small association with more schooling and greater likelihood
22:659:56780:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of watching news in the media. Four additional years of school, for example raises the probability
22:660:56878:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of watching news every day by about 3 percentage points. The instrumental variables results are
22:661:56973:20:19:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:not only insignificantly different from zero, but also insignificantly different from the least squares
22:662:57076:19:20:72:106:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:results.
22:663:57084:20:20:88:539:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:All 50 Eurobarometers ask questions about whether respondents discuss politics, try to persuade
22:664:57179:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:people of their views, and consider themselves politically active. We find strong effects of schooling
22:665:57281:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on all these variables. For example, those compelled to take an extra year of school, because the
22:666:57378:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:minimum school leaving age was raised, are about 7 percentage points more likely to report they
22:667:57473:20:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:try to persuade others to share their views, 6 percentage points more likely to frequently discuss
22:668:57571:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:political matters with friends, and 3 percentage points more likely to consider themselves politically
22:669:57673:20:20:72:103:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:active.
22:670:57680:20:20:88:539:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:These results suggest that education improves participation not only as measured by voter
22:671:57769:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:turnout, but also in broader measures. As well, the evidence on education and political information
22:672:57868:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:may provide support for models that focus on the lower cost of information acquisition for the more
22:673:57967:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:highly educated. However, it may also be the case that voters who know they will not vote do not
22:674:58063:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:bother investing in the acquisition of political information. We leave further investigation of the
22:675:58162:20:34:72:424:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:channels through which education affects participation to future research.
22:676:58236:34:31:72:170:159:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:C:6  Discussion
22:677:58249:31:20:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:We find a strong and robust relationship between education and voting in the United States, but
22:678:58344:20:19:72:540:108:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:not in the United Kingdom. When the US sample is restricted only to citizens who are registered,
22:679:58440:19:0:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the estimated effect of education on voting drops to less than a third of the effect for the full sample.
23:680:58547:0:20:72:540:672:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:In addition, our evidence on broader outcomes indicates that education increases citizens’ attention
23:681:58647:20:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to public affairs and to following politics. More educated citizens appear to have more information
23:682:58746:20:20:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on candidates and campaigns. We find similar results across both countries. Overall, these results
23:683:58844:20:20:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lend support to the notion that education has social externalities through the production of a better
23:684:58945:20:20:72:102:592:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:polity.
23:685:58952:20:20:88:539:572:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Our results on registration suggest an interesting counterfactual — what would happen if the
23:686:59044:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registration regime in the US were changed to resemble that of the UK? The answer depends on
23:687:59136:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:which of two distinct cases holds. On one hand, if citizens don’t care about the costs of registration
23:688:59238:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:or they do not suffer from procrastination, then anyone who plans to vote will register. In this case,
23:689:59340:20:20:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registration is a veil. Changes in the registration regime would have no impact on the education
23:690:59436:20:19:72:160:472:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:gradient of voting.
23:691:59455:19:20:88:539:453:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:On the other hand, if costs matter or if procrastination is a concern, then a liberalization of
23:692:59550:20:20:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registration could increase voting. To the extent that the registration barrier disproportionately
23:693:59648:20:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:affects the low-educated, liberalizations of the registration regime could increase the turnout of
23:694:59746:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the low-educated and flatten the education gradient. As the empirical literature on the effects of
23:695:59844:20:20:72:417:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:registration expansion is mixed, we cannot draw any strong conclusions.
23:696:59915:20:20:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:However, holding the existing US registration regime constant, our results have clear implica-
23:697:60009:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:tions for citizenship behavior under our main counterfactual of interest. Our estimates suggest that
23:698:60109:20:20:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:an increase in educational attainment causes an increase in voter turnout in the US, but not in
23:699:60204:20:20:72:540:293:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the UK. For the US, the magnitude for a high school graduate on the self-reported probability of
23:700:60300:20:20:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:voting is on the order of 28.8 to 34.2 percentage points. Given that the high school attainment
23:701:60395:20:20:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rate among those 25 and older increased by 36.1 percentage points from 1964 to 2000 (US Census
23:702:60489:20:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Bureau (2000)), our estimates suggest that the 2000 turnout rate would have been 10.4 to 12.3
23:703:60582:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:percentage points lower if the high school completion rate had not changed from 1964, holding all
23:704:60679:20:19:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:other factors constant. In other words, we predict that the observed drop in the turnout rate would
23:705:60778:19:20:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:have been even sharper, if it were not for the large observed increase in high school attainment
23:706:60874:20:0:72:186:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between 1964 and 2000.
