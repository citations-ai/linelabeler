2:26:1209:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:As the share of older immigrants residing in the U.S. begins to rise, it is important to understand 
2:27:1309:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:how immigrants’  retirement  behavior  and  security  compare  to  that  of  natives.  This  question  has 
2:28:1415:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:implications for  the  impact  of  immigration  on  government  finances  and  for  the  retirement 
2:29:1514:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:security  of  immigrants. We  use  data  from  the  Health  and  Retirement  Study  (HRS)  to  examine 
2:30:1616:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:how  immigrants’  retirement and  Social  Security  claiming  patterns  compare  to  those  of  natives. 
2:31:1720:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:We find that immigrants are significantly less likely than natives to retire or claim Social Security 
2:32:1821:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:in their early 60s. We do not find heterogeneous effects by ethnicity or age of arrival to the U.S. 
2:33:1920:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:We also find no evidence that immigrants exit the survey at higher rates than U.S. natives in their 
2:34:2019:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:late 50s through 60s, a finding that is consistent with immigrants retiring in the U.S. rather than 
2:35:2118:14:42:72:108:462:12:Times:12:Times:abroad.

3:46:2310:0:14:72:152:708:12:Times:12:Times:1. Introduction 
3:47:2325:14:13:72:75:694:12:Times:12:Times: 
3:48:2325:13:21:108:543:681:12:Times:12:Times:Along  with  the  aging  of  the  general U.S. population,  the  share  of  older  immigrants  has 
3:49:2424:21:21:72:542:660:12:Times:12:Times:been  growing as  well.1 However,  the  retirement  behavior  of immigrants remains  understudied. 
3:50:2520:21:20:72:543:639:12:Times:12:Times:This  behavior has implications  for  the  impact  of  immigration  on  government  finances, and  for 
3:51:2620:20:21:72:542:619:12:Times:12:Times:the  retirement  security  of an  important  subgroup  of  the  population.  Longer  working  lives 
3:52:2720:21:21:72:543:598:12:Times:12:Times:mitigate  the  pressure  that aging  populations  place on  both  public  budgets  and  private  savings. 
3:53:2825:21:21:72:543:577:12:Times:12:Times:However,  retirement  can  improve  health  and  well-being  (e.g.,  Gorry,  Gorry,  and  Slavov  2018), 
3:54:2930:21:20:72:542:556:12:Times:12:Times:and differences  across  demographic  groups  in  time  spent  in  retirement  can  have  important 
3:55:3030:20:21:72:543:536:12:Times:12:Times:distributional implications (Ghilarducci and Webb 2018). The timing of Social Security claiming 
3:56:3126:21:21:72:542:515:12:Times:12:Times:can  also  have  important  implications  for  retirement  well-being.  Social  Security  retired  worker 
3:57:3232:21:20:72:543:494:12:Times:12:Times:benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with larger monthly benefits available for 
3:58:3329:20:21:72:543:474:12:Times:12:Times:later claims. Recent research has shown that this adjustment for delay is actuarially advantageous 
3:59:3428:21:21:72:542:453:12:Times:12:Times:for  most  primary earners  and  singles  (e.g., Meyer  and Reichenstein 2010, 2012;  Sass,  Sun, and 
3:60:3530:21:20:72:542:432:12:Times:12:Times:Webb 2013; and Shoven and Slavov 2014a, 2014b), and that delayed claiming can substantially 
3:61:3622:20:21:72:543:412:12:Times:12:Times:increase retirement living standards (Bronshtein et al. 2018). In this paper, we use data from the 
3:62:3721:21:21:72:543:391:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine how immigrants’ retirement and Social Security 
3:63:3813:21:20:72:298:370:12:Times:12:Times:claiming patterns compare to those of natives.  
3:64:3860:20:21:108:543:350:12:Times:12:Times:The  existing  literature  on  retirement  has  documented  that  in  the  population  overall, 
3:65:3955:21:21:72:543:329:12:Times:12:Times:retirement hazards increase sharply at the early Social Security eligibility age (62) and the Social 
3:66:4055:21:21:72:543:308:12:Times:12:Times:Security  full  retirement  age  (which  varies  between  65  and  67  depending  on  birth  year).  (For 
3:67:4161:21:20:72:543:287:12:Times:12:Times:example, see Behagel and Blau 2012.) The probability of retirement is also influenced by health 
3:68:4257:20:21:72:542:267:12:Times:12:Times:(e.g.,  McGarry  2004),  the  availability  of  post-retirement  health  insurance  (e.g.,  Gruber  and 
3:69:4361:21:21:72:543:246:12:Times:12:Times:Madrian  1995;  Kapur  and  Rogowski  2011;  Marton  and  Woodbury  2006,  2012;  Robinson  and 
3:70:4457:21:20:72:543:225:12:Times:12:Times:Clark 2010; Blau and Gilleskie 2001; Madrian 1994; Strumpf 2010; Nyce et al. 2013), quality of 
3:71:4552:20:21:72:543:205:12:Times:12:Times:work (e.g., Siegrist et al. 2007), macroeconomic conditions that affect retirement wealth and job 
3:72:4650:21:52:72:543:184:12:Times:12:Times:opportunities  (e.g.,  Gorodnichenko  et  al.  2013;  Goda  et  al.  2012;  Hurd  and  Reti  2001;  Hurd, 
3:73:4756:52:9:216:219:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                       
3:74:4810:9:15:72:537:123:6:Times:10:Times:1 Between 1960 and 2000, the share of immigrants aged 65 and older dropped from 33 percent to 11 percent mainly 
3:75:4921:15:11:72:542:108:10:Times:10:Times:because the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act led to in an influx of younger, working-age immigrants (Batalova 
3:76:5034:11:12:72:522:97:10:Times:10:Times:2012). However, the share of older immigrants has been increasing recently, with 14.4 percent of the immigrant 
3:77:5145:12:11:72:533:85:10:Times:10:Times:population aged 65 years or older in 2016, due to the aging of these working-age immigrants as well as an increase 
3:78:5257:11:0:72:533:74:10:Times:10:Times:in the number of older immigrants sponsored by their adult children (Batalova 2012; Wilmoth 2012; Borjas 2011). 
4:79:5369:0:20:72:542:708:12:Times:12:Times:Reti,  and  Rohwedder  2009;  Kezdi  and  Sevak  2004;  Coile  and  Levine  2010),  and  pension 
4:80:5466:20:21:72:274:688:12:Times:12:Times:incentives (e.g., Coile and Gruber 2007).  
4:81:5508:21:21:108:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:There  are  reasons  to  believe  that  immigrants  may  display  different  retirement  patterns 
4:82:5606:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:than  the  native  born.  First,  immigrants  may  be  less  prepared  for  retirement.  Immigrants tend  to 
4:83:5715:21:20:72:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:have lower  Social  Security  benefits  compared  to  U.S.  natives  (Sevak  and  Schmidt  2014, 
4:84:5812:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:Favreault  and  Nichols  2011)  due  to  both  lower  average  earnings  and  shorter  covered  earnings 
4:85:5917:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:histories.2 Further, unauthorized migrants residing in the U.S. are not entitled to Social Security 
4:86:6015:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:benefits  even  if  they  make  payroll  tax  contributions.  Immigrants  also  tend  to  have  lower 
4:87:6117:20:21:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:retirement  wealth and are  less  likely  to  take  advantage  of  tax  preferred  retirement  savings 
4:88:6219:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:opportunities  (Cobb-Clark  and  Hildebrand  2006;  Heim  et  al. 2012;  Osili  and  Paulson  2009 
4:89:6317:21:20:72:542:501:12:Times:12:Times:Fontes 2011). Further, immigrants may have less access to pre-Medicare health insurance that is 
4:90:6412:20:21:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:independent  of  employment. These  differences  suggest  that  immigrants  may  work  longer  than 
4:91:6512:21:21:72:111:460:12:Times:12:Times:natives. 
4:92:6520:21:21:108:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:Second,  immigrants  are  likely  to  face  smaller  work  disincentives  from  Social  Security 
4:93:6617:21:20:72:543:418:12:Times:12:Times:compared  to  natives.  Social  Security  benefits  are  based  on  the  average  of  the  top  35  years  of 
4:94:6727:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:earnings,  indexed  for  economy-wide  wage  growth. Zeros  are  averaged  in  for  career  lengths 
4:95:6827:21:21:72:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:shorter  than  35  years.  Longer  careers  translate  into  higher  average  earnings  and monthly 
4:96:6927:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:benefits,  but  there  are  diminishing  returns  because  the  formula  mapping  earnings  to  benefits  is 
4:97:7036:20:21:72:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:progressive. Once 35 years in covered employment have been reached, additional years of work 
4:98:7128:21:21:72:543:315:12:Times:12:Times:may have little to no impact on Social Security benefits (even if they are in the top 35 years they 
4:99:7226:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:displace a positive rather than a zero earnings year). This pattern creates work disincentives for 
4:100:7325:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:individuals with longer covered careers (Goda, Shoven, and Slavov 2009). Immigrants generally 
4:101:7419:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:have shorter covered earnings histories than natives because a portion of their working lives was 
4:102:7517:21:20:72:480:232:12:Times:12:Times:spent outside the U.S.; thus, they may face smaller work disincentives at older ages.  
4:103:7603:20:21:108:543:212:12:Times:12:Times:Third,  differences  in  health  status  between  immigrants  and  natives  may  affect  work 
4:104:7697:21:21:72:543:191:12:Times:12:Times:capacity. Johnson et al. (2016) report that 59 percent of Hispanic immigrants aged 65 and older 
4:105:7793:21:21:72:543:170:12:Times:12:Times:reported  fair  and  poor  health  compared  to  25  percent  for  non-Hispanic  white natives.  McGarry 
4:106:7898:21:20:72:543:149:12:Times:12:Times:(2004)  shows  that poor  or  worsening  health  reduces  the  probability  of continued  work.  This 
4:107:7999:20:20:72:314:129:12:Times:12:Times:would suggest that immigrants may retire earlier.  
4:108:8048:20:9:216:219:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                       
4:109:8102:9:15:72:535:100:6:Times:10:Times:2 These differences are more likely among those who immigrated to the U.S. more recently (who have lower wages 
4:110:8212:15:11:72:538:85:10:Times:10:Times:relative to natives, as documented by Favreault and Nichols 2011) or at older ages (who have lower incomes, Social 
4:111:8327:11:0:72:423:74:10:g_d0_f5:10:Times:Security benefits, and Medicare coverage, as documented by O’Neil and Tienda 2014). 
5:112:8411:0:20:108:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:Finally,  immigrants  and  natives may  also have  differences  in  Social  Security  claiming 
5:113:8505:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times:12:Times:patterns.  Even  though  most  primary  earners  and  singles  can  increase  their  lifetime  Social 
5:114:8607:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:Security wealth by delaying claiming, most people claim well before 70 (e.g., Goda et al. 2018). 
5:115:8704:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:A commonly observed pattern is claiming upon stopping work (e.g., Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 
5:116:8795:21:20:72:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:2018).  If  immigrants  work  longer  than  natives,  then  they  may  also  claim  Social  Security  later 
5:117:8903:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:than natives. Claiming need not coincide with retirement if individuals have the private savings 
5:118:9000:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:needed to delay claiming beyond retirement. However, most people do not appear to utilize such 
5:119:9095:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:a delay strategy even when it is feasible (Goda et al. 2018; Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 2018), and 
5:120:9192:20:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:the  strategy  may  be  less  feasible  for  immigrants  given  the  immigrant-native  differences  in 
5:121:9295:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:retirement  resources  noted above. Mortality  also  affects  claiming  incentives.  In  the  U.S.  and 
5:122:9399:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:other   developed   countries, researchers   have   documented an  “immigrant  paradox”  where 
5:123:9494:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:immigrants tend to outlive natives despite their lower levels of education, lower levels of wealth, 
5:124:9594:21:21:72:542:460:12:Times:12:Times:higher  levels  of  poverty,  and  poorer  access  to  health  care  relative  to  U.S.  natives  (Blue  and 
5:125:9703:21:21:72:542:439:12:Times:12:Times:Fenelon  2011;  Dupre  et  al.  2012;  Mehta  et  al.  2016). Empirically,  individuals  with  greater 
5:126:9806:21:20:72:543:418:12:Times:12:Times:subjective  or  actual  mortality  tend  to  claim  earlier  (Goda,  Ramnath,  Shoven, and  Slavov 2018; 
5:127:9909:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:Hurd,  Smith,  and  Zissimopoulos  2004;  Glickman  and  Hermes  2015; Beauchamp  and  Wagner 
5:128:10003:21:21:72:181:377:12:Times:12:Times:2012; Waldron 2002). 
5:129:10023:21:20:108:542:356:12:Times:12:Times:Few  studies  have  examined  differences  in  retirement  timing  between  immigrants  and 
5:130:10115:20:21:72:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:U.S. natives. Johnson et al. (2017) show that foreign-born Hispanics tend to retire later than U.S. 
5:131:10215:21:21:72:542:315:12:Times:12:Times:born Hispanics or non-Hispanics. Borjas (2011) shows that becoming eligible for Social Security 
5:132:10311:21:20:72:542:294:12:Times:12:Times:benefits – which  requires  10  years  of  covered  employment – increases the  probability  of 
5:133:10404:20:21:72:542:274:12:Times:12:Times:retirement among older immigrants. Kaushal (2010) shows that older immigrants increased their 
5:134:10498:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:labor  supply  in  response  to  becoming  ineligible  for  Supplemental  Security  Income  under  the 
5:135:10601:21:20:72:543:232:12:Times:12:Times:1996  welfare  reform.  Our  study  is  most  closely  related  to  Johnson  et  al.  (2017),  who  use  a 
5:136:10708:20:21:72:543:212:12:Times:12:Times:proportional hazard model to examine differences in retirement timing. We extend their work by 
5:137:10803:21:21:72:543:191:12:Times:12:Times:using a more  flexible  specification  of  retirement  hazards (interacting individual  age  dummies 
5:138:10904:21:21:72:542:170:12:Times:12:Times:with  immigrant  status) to  examine immigrant-native  differences  in  the sharp  increases in 
5:139:10999:21:20:72:543:149:12:Times:12:Times:retirement  rates at  key  eligibility  ages,  such  as  62  and  full  retirement  age.  We  also  separately 
5:140:11110:20:21:72:540:129:12:Times:12:Times:examine Social Security claiming and retirement timing, and we include both Hispanic and non-
5:141:11203:21:21:72:254:108:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanic immigrants in our analysis.  
5:142:11240:21:0:108:543:87:12:Times:12:Times:Finally, we  attempt  to  shed  more  light  on  where  immigrants  retire  by  examining 
6:143:11331:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:differences  in  the  survey  exit  rates  between  immigrants  and  natives.  It  is  possible  that  some 
6:144:11439:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:immigrants  choose  to  retire  in  their  native  countries.  De  Coulon  (2016)  provides  a  theoretical 
6:145:11547:21:21:72:542:667:12:Times:12:Times:framework to study this decision, but no empirical studies have been done mainly due to the lack 
6:146:11643:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:of  data  on  final  destinations  of  immigrants. Kapteyn  et  al.  (2006)  document  that  foreign  born 
6:147:11750:21:20:72:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:HRS respondents are more likely than average to exit the survey, a finding they argue could be a 
6:148:11847:20:21:72:542:605:12:Times:12:Times:result  of  immigrants  returning  to  their  native  countries.  Thus,  we may  be  able  to to  gain some 
6:149:11954:21:21:72:542:584:12:Times:12:Times:insight  into whether immigrants retire  abroad by examining how  these  attrition  rates  vary  with 
6:150:12054:21:20:72:542:563:12:Times:12:Times:age. A higher attrition rate for immigrants at ages that coincide with retirement (late 50s through 
6:151:12154:20:21:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:60s) may indicate a propensity to retire abroad. Trying to understand where immigrants retire has 
6:152:12252:21:21:72:542:522:12:Times:12:Times:important implications for both the host and source countries. For example, immigrants returning 
6:153:12349:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:to their countries of origin may reduce health care costs for the host country, but increase them 
6:154:12445:20:21:72:283:481:12:Times:12:Times:for the county of origin (De Coulon 2016).  
6:155:12488:21:21:108:542:460:12:Times:12:Times:We find that immigrants are significantly less likely than natives to retire in their late 50s 
6:156:12583:21:21:72:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:or early 60s, and to claim Social Security before full retirement age. We do not find significant 
6:157:12680:21:20:72:542:418:12:Times:12:Times:heterogeneity among immigrants based on Hispanic ethnicity or age of arrival in the U.S. While 
6:158:12775:20:21:72:542:398:12:Times:12:Times:immigrants  have  a  higher  survey  attrition  rate  overall, this  gap  seems  to  narrow  at  older  ages 
6:159:12884:21:21:72:542:377:12:Times:12:Times:(late 50s through the 60s). Thus, we do not pick up any evidence of immigrants retiring abroad at 
6:160:12982:21:20:72:197:356:12:Times:12:Times:higher rates than natives.

6:164:13042:14:20:108:543:287:12:Times:12:Times:We use data from the 1992 to 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a 
6:165:13126:20:21:72:543:267:12:Times:12:Times:biennial national  longitudinal  survey  of  individuals  over  the  age  of  50  and  their  spouses  or 
6:166:13232:21:21:72:543:246:12:Times:12:Times:partners. The survey began in 1992 with individuals born between 1931 and 1941 (original HRS 
6:167:13325:21:20:72:543:225:12:Times:12:Times:cohort).  New  cohorts  were  added  in  1993  (AHEAD  cohort),  1998  (Children  of  Depression  and 
6:168:13427:20:21:72:543:205:12:Times:12:Times:War  Baby  cohorts),  2004  (Early  Baby  Boomer  cohort),  and  2010  (Mid  Baby  Boomer  cohort). 
6:169:13527:21:21:72:542:184:12:Times:12:Times:For  most  variables  in  this  analysis,  we  use  the  RAND  HRS  data  file (Version  P).  The  RAND 
6:170:13630:21:20:72:543:163:12:Times:12:Times:HRS is a cleaned dataset with consistent variables across survey waves derived from a subset of 
6:171:13726:20:21:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the original HRS data files. We refer to an individual’s baseline wave as the wave in which the 
6:172:13822:21:21:72:261:122:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:individual’s cohort entered the sample. 
6:173:13861:21:21:108:542:101:12:Times:12:Times:We  drop  individuals  with  missing  values  for race  or  Hispanic  ethnicity,  gender,  and 
6:174:13956:21:0:72:543:80:12:Times:12:Times:education. Because we are interested in studying transitions from work to retirement, we restrict 
7:175:14055:0:20:72:542:708:12:Times:12:Times:the  sample  to  individuals  who  were  working  for  pay  during  their  baseline  wave.  We  construct 
7:176:14161:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:indicators for self-employment status, as well as the occupation and industry for the longest-held 
7:177:14260:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:job,  during  the  baseline  wave.  We  drop  individuals  with  missing  baseline  self-employment 
7:178:14360:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:status,  and  we  create  separate  categories  for  individuals  with  missing  or  “other”  baseline 
7:179:14463:21:20:72:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:occupation  or  industry.  We  construct  a  measure  of  household  wealth  in  the  baseline  wave  by 
7:180:14568:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:summing  the  RAND HRS  measure of non-housing financial wealth  (which  excludes  retirement 
7:181:14662:21:21:72:542:584:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:wealth), the household’s total assets in individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and any balances 
7:182:14758:21:20:72:490:563:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:in the respondent’s or spouse’s defined contribution accounts from their current jobs.3  
7:183:14845:20:21:108:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:The  main  independent  variable  of  interest  is  whether  an  individual  is  foreign  born.  The 
7:184:14946:21:21:72:542:522:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:HRS  reports  an  individual’s place of birth as either as a Census Division or “not in the U.S.” 
7:185:15044:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:(including  foreign  countries  and  U.S.  territories).  We  exclude  individuals  whose  birthplace  is 
7:186:15150:20:21:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:unknown. Individuals who were not born in the U.S. were asked about their year of entry into the 
7:187:15247:21:21:72:543:460:12:Times:12:Times:U.S.  Responses  to  this  question  are  only  available  in  the  original  HRS  data  files;  therefore,  we 
7:188:15359:21:21:72:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:extract and merge this variable with the RAND HRS. Information on date of entry into the U.S. 
7:189:15453:21:20:72:542:418:12:g_d0_f5:12:Times:was taken from the wave in which the individual’s cohort was added to the survey.4 In addition 
7:190:15547:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:to a binary foreign-born indicator, we also construct two alternative indicators that subdivide the 
7:191:15646:21:21:72:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:foreign-born  sample  into  Hispanic  and  non-Hispanic individuals, and  into  immigrants who 
7:192:15739:21:20:72:542:356:12:Times:12:Times:entered  the  U.S.  before  age  40  and  those  who  entered  at  age  40  or  later.5 Hispanic  immigrants 
7:193:15847:20:21:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:have  limited  financial  resources  and  Social  Security  benefits, and  lower  levels  of  education, 
7:194:15950:21:21:72:543:315:12:Times:12:Times:relative  to  other  immigrants  and  U.S.  natives,  which  may  delay  their  retirement.  However, 
7:195:16052:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanic  immigrants  also  tend  to hold more  physically  demanding  jobs  and be  in  worse  health 
7:196:16153:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:relative to other immigrants and U.S. natives, which could accelerate their retirement (Johnson et 
7:197:16251:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:al. 2017). Immigrants who arrived later have spent a shorter portion of their careers in the U.S. 
7:198:16349:21:20:72:543:232:12:Times:12:Times:are more likely to still be accruing significant Social Security benefits at older ages and to have 
7:199:16447:20:22:72:408:212:12:Times:12:Times:limited Social Security benefits, factors that tend to delay retirement.  
7:200:16520:22:9:216:219:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                       
7:201:16574:9:15:72:534:181:6:Times:10:Times:3 Wealth is in nominal dollars at the time of the survey. Wave dummies in the regressions should absorb the effects 
7:202:16689:15:8:72:122:166:10:Times:10:Times:of inflation. 
7:203:16702:8:15:72:542:158:6:Times:10:Times:4 From 1993 onwards, individuals could report either a year of entry, an age of entry, or the number of years ago that 
7:204:16820:15:11:72:534:143:10:Times:10:Times:entry occurred. The 1992 and 1993 surveys simply asked respondents when they arrived in the U.S. In 1998, 2004, 
7:205:16932:11:12:72:505:132:10:Times:10:Times:and 2010, respondents were asked when they first arrived in the U.S., whether they ever left, and when they 
7:206:17040:12:11:72:524:120:10:Times:10:Times:subsequently returned. For these waves, we record the date that the respondent first arrived in the U.S. The 2010 
7:207:17154:11:12:72:541:109:10:Times:10:Times:wave includes information about citizenship and naturalization. However, these questions only appear to be asked of 
7:208:17270:12:8:72:239:97:10:Times:10:Times:respondents entering the survey in 2010.  
7:209:17311:8:15:72:531:89:6:g_d0_f2:10:Times:5 The latter indicator also includes a category for foreign born individuals with missing information on age/year of 
7:210:17425:15:0:72:97:74:10:Times:10:g_d0_f2:entry. 
8:211:17432:0:20:108:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:After  constructing  baseline  wave  characteristics,  we  perform  subsequent  analysis  at  the 
8:212:17530:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times:12:Times:person-wave level, and we drop any person-wave observations with zero sampling weight; these 
8:213:17623:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:are generally individuals who are not part of the target population, such as spouses under the age 
8:214:17721:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:of  50  and  institutionalized  individuals. At  the  person-wave  level,  we  construct  an indicator  for 
8:215:17828:21:20:72:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:married/partnered  status.  Because  immigrants  are  more  likely  to  live  in  larger  households  with 
8:216:17935:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:extended family, and because such living arrangements can affect retirement decisions, we also 
8:217:18030:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:create  an  indicator  for  whether  the  household  includes  members  other  than  the  respondent  and 
8:218:18136:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:spouse.6 The  HRS additionally includes  a  measure  of  self-reported health  in  which  individuals 
8:219:18236:20:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:rate their health on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). We construct an indicator that takes on a 
8:220:18337:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:value  of  1 for excellent,  very  good,  or  good  health and  zero  for fair  or  poor  health. Because 
8:221:18440:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:retirement timing may depend on macroeconomic conditions and wealth shocks (e.g., Goda et al. 
8:222:18534:20:21:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:2011),   we   also merge   in   the   monthly   composite   S&P   500   index   (obtained   from 
8:223:18630:21:21:72:543:460:12:Times:12:Times:http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm)   and   the   monthly   regional   unemployment   rate 
8:224:18729:21:21:72:542:439:12:Times:12:Times:(obtained  from  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics),  both  matched  to  the  month  and  year  of  the 
8:225:18834:21:20:72:543:418:12:Times:12:Times:interview.  Individuals  who  have  a  missing  value  for  region  are  assigned  the  monthly  national 
8:226:18940:20:21:72:170:398:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rate. 
8:227:18958:21:21:108:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:Defining retirement is problematic. Prior research has shown that retirement is often not a 
8:228:19050:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:clean  transition.  Many  individuals  who  are  in  the  process  of  retirement  gradually  reduce  hours, 
8:229:19159:20:21:72:543:336:12:Times:12:Times:retire temporarily and then go back to work, continue to work after retiring from a career job, or 
8:230:19258:21:21:72:543:315:12:Times:12:Times:switch  to  self-employment  with  significantly  reduced  earnings  (e.g.,  Maestas  2010;  Ramnath, 
8:231:19360:21:20:72:542:294:12:Times:12:Times:Shoven, and Slavov 2017). We construct two separate indicators for retirement. First, we define 
8:232:19455:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:retirement as a transition from working for pay to not working for pay. This definition may also 
8:233:19552:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:include  transitions  from  work  to  unemployment,  disability,  or  being  out  of  the  labor  force. 
8:234:19657:21:20:72:540:232:12:Times:12:Times:Second,  we  define  retirement  as  a  transition  from  self-reporting  that  one  is  not  retired  to  self-
8:235:19769:20:21:72:542:212:12:Times:12:Times:reporting that one is retired. It may include people who are working part time but still consider 
8:236:19867:21:24:72:542:191:12:Times:12:Times:themselves  retired.  Each indicator takes on a  value of 1 if the  individual  was not retired in  the 
8:237:19971:24:9:216:219:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                       
8:238:20025:9:15:72:499:158:6:Times:10:Times:6 In 2015, the foreign born were twice as likely to live in 5 or more person families than the U.S. born (see

8:240:20237:12:11:72:512:131:10:Times:10:Times:immigrants were more likely than whites and U.S. natives to live in multigenerational family households (see

9:247:20665:20:21:72:264:688:12:Times:12:Times:waves. It is missing in all other cases.    
9:248:20708:21:21:108:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:We  also  construct  two  indicators  for  claiming  Social  Security.  We  first  construct  an 
9:249:20805:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:indicator for claiming that takes on the value of 1 if an individual was not receiving any Social 
9:250:20903:21:20:72:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:Security  retirement   income   in   the   previous  wave  and   currently   receives  Social   Security 
9:251:21008:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:retirement income, and 0 if the individual was not receiving Social Security retirement income in 
9:252:21106:21:21:72:542:584:12:Times:12:Times:either  wave.  It  is  missing  in  all  other  cases.  One  concern  is  that some  individuals  who are  not 
9:253:21217:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:observed  to  claim  Social  Security  within  the  sample  period  may  not  be  eligible  for  Social 
9:254:21321:20:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:Security. Unfortunately, the public use HRS data do not allow us to identify individuals who are 
9:255:21418:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:eligible. To address this concern, we construct a second claiming indicator that is identical to the 
9:256:21518:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:first,  except  that  it excludes  all individuals  who  are  either  not  observed  to  claim  during  the 
9:257:21626:20:21:72:542:481:12:Times:12:Times:sample period or who leave the sample before age 70.7 Since Social Security disability benefits 
9:258:21720:21:21:72:542:460:12:Times:12:Times:convert to retirement benefits at an individual’s full retirement age, we also exclude individuals 
9:259:21819:21:21:72:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:who  have  ever  applied  for  disability  benefits  from  the  Social  Security  claiming  regressions. 
9:260:21924:21:20:72:542:418:12:Times:12:Times:Unfortunately, the survey does not include information on the type of Social Security retirement 
9:261:22021:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:benefit received (e.g., retired worker, spousal, or survivor). Unlike worker benefits, spousal and 
9:262:22120:21:21:72:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:survivor  benefits  do  not  grow  beyond  full  retirement  age,  although  they  may  be  claimed  early 
9:263:22227:21:20:72:188:356:12:Times:12:Times:(subject to a reduction). 
9:264:22252:20:21:108:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:To  examine  where  immigrants  choose  to  retire,  we  construct  an  indicator  for  attrition 
9:265:22349:21:21:72:543:315:12:Times:12:Times:that takes on a value of 1 if an individual responded to the survey in the previous wave but did 
9:266:22446:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:not respond in the current wave (and was also not indicated to have died).8 The indicator takes on 
9:267:22544:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:a  value  of  0  if  the  individual  responded  in  both  the  previous  wave  and  the  current  wave.  It  is 
9:268:22657:21:21:72:542:253:12:Times:12:Times:missing  in  all  other  cases. In  the  absence  of  better  data,  such  an  indicator  can  provide  some 
9:269:22765:21:20:72:440:232:12:Times:12:Times:preliminary evidence regarding whether immigrants choose to retire abroad. 
9:270:22839:20:21:108:543:212:12:Times:12:Times:Table  1  summarizes  our  sample  selection  and  indicates  both  the  number  of  individuals 
9:271:22936:21:21:72:542:191:12:Times:12:Times:and  the  number  of  person-year  observations  after  each  sample  restriction.  After  dropping 
9:272:23036:21:15:72:542:170:12:Times:12:Times:individuals who have missing baseline characteristics, we have 144,446 person-year observations 
9:273:23132:15:9:216:219:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:                                                       
9:274:23186:9:15:72:524:146:6:Times:10:Times:7 Social Security benefits do not grow with delay past age 70. Thus, claiming after 70 is almost never optimal. A 
9:275:23299:15:11:72:523:131:10:Times:10:Times:possible exception is that some individuals (late life immigrants, for example) may not have not accumulated 10 
9:276:23411:11:12:72:537:120:10:Times:10:Times:years of covered work by age 70. If these individuals continue to work beyond 70, they could claim once they reach 
9:277:23526:12:8:72:456:108:10:Times:10:Times:the required 10 years. We think such cases are rare as most people do not work beyond age 70.  
9:278:23620:8:15:72:539:100:6:Times:10:Times:8 Specifically, we set the attrition indicator to 1 if the RAND HRS variable riwstat is equal to 1 in the previous wave 
9:279:23739:15:11:72:516:85:10:Times:10:Times:and either 4 or 7 in the current wave. It is equal to 0 if riwstat is equal to 1 in both the previous and the current 
9:280:23857:11:0:72:102:74:10:Times:10:Times:waves. 
10:281:23864:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:and 16,805 individuals. Our retirement and claiming hazard regressions are based on the 67,939 
10:282:23959:20:21:72:542:688:12:Times:12:Times:observations  (15,215  individuals)  with  non-missing  values  for  at  least  one  of  the  retirement  or 
10:283:24068:21:21:72:542:667:12:Times:12:Times:claiming indicators, as well as non-missing values for all the independent variables (described in 
10:284:24167:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:the  following  section).  The  attrition  hazard  regressions  are  based  on  the  96,087  observations 
10:285:24273:21:20:72:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:(16,192 individuals) with a non-missing value for the dependent variable. Independent variables 
10:286:24368:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:in  the  attrition  regressions  include  only  baseline  characteristics  and  age,  as  other  time-varying 
10:287:24478:21:21:72:427:584:12:Times:12:Times:characteristics are not available for those who dropped out of the survey.  
10:288:24553:21:20:108:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:Table 2 provides summary statistics for the full sample (left panel), for the foreign-born 
10:289:24644:20:21:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:subsample  (middle  panel),  and  for  the  Hispanic  foreign-born  subsample  (right  panel).  The  top 
10:290:24749:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:panel  provides  means  and  standard  deviations  for  the  dependent  variables  used  in  the  analysis. 
10:291:24857:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:The next panel down provides means and standard deviations for the foreign-born indicators and 
10:292:24950:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:is  based  on  the  sample  used  in  the  retirement  and  claiming  hazard  regressions.    Approximately 
10:293:25058:21:21:72:543:460:12:Times:12:Times:10 percent of the sample is foreign born, and roughly half of these are Hispanic. The majority of 
10:294:25156:21:21:72:542:439:12:Times:12:Times:the foreign born entered before age 40. The next panel down provides summary statistics for the 
10:295:25252:21:20:72:542:418:12:Times:12:Times:other  independent  variables  used  in  the  regressions,  also based  on  the  sample  used  in  the 
10:296:25354:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:retirement  and  claiming  hazard  regressions. Comparing  the  full  sample  to  the  foreign  born 
10:297:25455:21:21:72:542:377:12:Times:12:Times:sample suggests that immigrants are roughly the same age as the full sample, slightly more likely 
10:298:25551:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:to be married or partnered, and slightly less like to have some college or higher. Immigrants also 
10:299:25650:20:21:72:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:have  lower  total  wealth  at  baseline  and  are  less  likely to  report  good  health  relative  to the  full 
10:300:25764:21:21:72:542:315:12:Times:12:Times:sample. Hispanic immigrants are younger, have lower wealth, are much less likely to have some 
10:301:25858:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:college  or  more, and are less likely to  report being  in  good health  relative  to the full  sample or 
10:302:25965:20:21:72:171:274:12:Times:12:Times:immigrants overall.

11:314:26420:21:21:72:543:666:12:Times:12:Times:indicator of whether individual 푖 has reached full retirement age in wave 푡; and 퐴퐺퐸푖푡 is a vector 
11:315:26516:21:21:72:542:645:12:Times:12:Times:of dummies for individual 푖’s age at the end of the wave 푡 interview. Age is truncated between 
11:316:26609:21:21:72:542:624:12:Times:12:Times:55  and  70  as  most  retirement  and  claiming  transitions  occur  during  this  frame. Full retirement 
11:317:26715:21:21:72:543:603:12:Times:12:Times:age  varies  among  individuals  in  our  sample  (based  on  year  of  birth),  and  prior  research  has 
11:318:26822:21:20:72:543:582:12:Times:12:Times:shown that individuals tend to retire and claim at whatever age is designated the full retirement 
11:319:26920:20:21:72:543:562:12:Times:12:Times:age  (Behaghel  and  Blau  2012).  To  capture  differences  between  foreign  born  and  native 
11:320:27017:21:21:72:543:541:12:Times:12:Times:individuals,  we  interact  the  age  dummies  and  the 퐹푅퐴푖푡 indicator  with  our  foreign-born 
11:321:27113:21:21:72:543:520:12:Times:12:Times:indicator. 푋푖 is  a  vector  of  time-invariant  controls  for  female  gender,  race,  Hispanic  ethnicity, 
11:322:27221:21:21:72:542:499:12:Times:12:Times:education,  household  wealth  at  baseline,  occupation  and  industry  of  the  longest  job  held  at 
11:323:27326:21:21:72:542:478:12:Times:12:Times:baseline,  and  self-employment  status  at  baseline. 푍푖푡 is  a  vector  of  time-varying  controls 
11:324:27426:21:21:72:542:457:12:Times:12:Times:including marital status; an indicator for the presence of other household members; and changes 
11:325:27522:21:21:72:543:436:12:Times:12:Times:in health status, the log of the S & P 500 index, and the regional unemployment rate between the 
11:326:27617:21:20:72:540:415:12:Times:12:Times:current and previous interview. Finally, we include wave fixed effects 푤푡 to control for any time-

11:329:27860:21:20:72:366:353:12:Times:12:Times:at key retirement ages, we estimate the following regression:

11:334:28190:21:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:who leave the sample, age and full retirement age status are imputed by adding two years to the 
11:335:28285:21:20:72:216:227:12:Times:12:Times:age at the previous interview. 
11:336:28315:20:21:108:543:207:12:Times:12:Times:We  utilize  ordinary  least  squares  to  estimate  (1)  and  (2),  making  our  regressions  linear 
11:337:28417:21:21:72:543:186:12:Times:12:Times:probability  models.  The  estimated  coefficient  on  each  age  dummy  represents  the native  born 
11:338:28519:21:20:72:542:165:12:Times:12:Times:hazard rate relative  to  the  omitted  age  category  (which  we  set  at  55  and  younger).  The

11:340:28725:21:21:72:543:124:12:Times:12:Times:extent to which the foreign-born hazard rates depart from the native hazard rates at each age. We 
11:341:28823:21:21:72:543:103:12:Times:12:Times:explore heterogeneity by estimating equations (1) and (2) using the more detailed specifications

12:349:29101:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:3 presents our main results for attrition. Retirement and claiming hazard regressions include the 
12:350:29198:21:21:72:542:584:12:Times:12:Times:full  set  of  control  variables,  and  all  regressions utilize  HRS  person-level  analysis  weights. 
12:351:29302:21:20:72:542:563:12:Times:12:Times:Results  without  controls  are  similar  and  are  available  upon  request. In  the  left  panel  of  each 
12:352:29410:20:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:figure, the vertical axis labels indicate the age dummies, the full retirement age dummy, and the 
12:353:29508:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:constant  term  from  equation  (1)  (in Figures  1  and  2)  or  equation  (2)  (in Figure  3).  The  dots 
12:354:29616:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:indicate the point estimates of each coefficient, and the horizontal line running through each dot 
12:355:29715:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:represents a 95 percent confidence interval calculated using robust standard errors. The omitted 
12:356:29812:21:21:72:542:460:12:Times:12:Times:category of 55  (and  younger) is represented  by  the  constant  term,  and  the  remaining  age 
12:357:29907:21:21:72:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:coefficients indicate  the  probability  of  a  native-born  individual  retiring  at  the  indicated  age 
12:358:30014:21:20:72:543:418:12:Times:12:Times:relative  to  age  55.  In  the  right  panel  of  each  figure,  the  constant  term  corresponds  to  the 
12:359:30122:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:coefficient  of  the  foreign-born  dummy  and  represents  immigrant-native  differences  in  the 
12:360:30221:21:21:72:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:probability of retiring (Figure 1), claiming (Figure 2), or leaving (Figure 3) at age 55 or younger. 
12:361:30321:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:This  coefficient  is  insignificant  in  almost  all  our  retirement  and  claiming  regressions. The 
12:362:30424:20:21:72:540:336:12:Times:12:Times:remaining age coefficients correspond to the interaction terms between the age and the foreign-
12:363:30519:21:21:72:540:315:12:Times:12:Times:born  indicators,  and  they indicate  the  increase  in  the  foreign-born  hazard  relative  to  the  native-

12:367:30844:21:20:72:543:232:12:Times:12:Times:from not retired to retired). The left panel of Figure 1a indicates that native born individuals are 
12:368:30945:20:21:72:542:212:12:Times:12:Times:15 percentage points more likely to transition to retirement at age 62 relative to age 55. The right 
12:369:31046:21:21:72:543:191:12:Times:12:Times:panel of Figure 1b indicates that the increase in the probability of retiring at 62, compared to the 
12:370:31147:21:21:72:542:170:12:Times:12:Times:omitted  category  of  55,  is 9.5  percentage  points  lower  for  the  foreign  born  than  natives. Both 
12:371:31255:21:20:72:542:149:12:Times:12:Times:coefficients  are significant  at  the  5  percent  level  as  the  confidence  intervals do  not  cross  the 
12:372:31364:20:21:72:543:129:12:Times:12:Times:vertical axis. In Figure 1b, natives are 22 percentage points more likely to retire at age 62 than at 
12:373:31466:21:21:72:543:108:12:Times:12:Times:age 55 (left panel), but the increase in the hazard of retirement at that age is 11 percentage points 
12:374:31568:21:0:72:543:87:12:Times:12:Times:less for immigrants (right panel). Overall, these figures suggest that immigrants are less likely to 
13:375:31670:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:retire  in  their  late  50s  and  early  60s  than  U.S.  natives.  Point  estimates  suggest  that  immigrants 
13:376:31783:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:may  be  more  likely  to  retire  in  their  late  60s  than  natives  (conditional  on  still  working  at  those 
13:377:31899:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:ages),  but  sample  sizes  at  these  older  ages  are  small  and  most  differences  are  statistically 
13:378:32006:21:21:72:141:646:12:Times:12:Times:insignificant.  
13:379:32021:21:20:108:543:625:12:Times:12:Times:Figure  2  shows  a  similar  pattern  when  it  comes  to  claiming  Social  Security.  In  the  two 
13:380:32123:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:left  panels,  the  constant  terms,  and  coefficients  on ages  56  through  61,  suggest  that  the 
13:381:32225:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:probability  of  claiming  Social  Security  before  age  62  is  very  close  to  zero.  This  result  is  not 
13:382:32337:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:surprising  since  62  is  the  earliest  eligibility  age  for  a  retired  worker  benefit  (although  survivor 
13:383:32451:20:21:72:542:543:12:Times:12:Times:benefits can be claimed as early as 60). The two right panels suggest that immigrant status does 
13:384:32548:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:not  affect  these  pre-62  probabilities.  The  left  panel  of  Figure  2a  shows  that, based  on our  first 
13:385:32660:21:20:72:542:501:12:Times:12:Times:indicator of claiming, the probability of claiming at age 62 for natives jumps to 16 percent. The 
13:386:32758:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:right  panel  shows  that  this  probability  is 5.9  percentage  points lower  for  immigrants. It  also 
13:387:32864:21:21:72:543:460:12:Times:12:Times:shows that immigrants are 24 percentage points more likely than natives to claim at age 69 and 
13:388:32959:21:21:72:543:439:12:Times:12:Times:12  percentage  points  more  likely  than  natives  to  claim  at  age  70  (conditional  on  not  having 
13:389:33066:21:20:72:543:418:12:Times:12:Times:claimed yet), possibly because natives who have not claimed by their late 60s are ineligible for 
13:390:33163:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:Social  Security.  We  find  similar  results  using  our  second  indicator  of  claiming,  which  is 
13:391:33266:21:21:72:543:377:12:Times:12:Times:conditional on claiming within the sample period and being observed through age 70. However, 
13:392:33359:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:immigrant-native differences at older ages are not statistically significant when we condition on 
13:393:33457:20:21:72:241:336:12:Times:12:Times:claiming within the sample period. 
13:394:33491:21:21:108:543:315:12:Times:12:Times: The  left  panel  of Figure  3  shows  that  U.S.  natives  are  less  likely  to  leave  the  sample  at 
13:395:33597:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:ages 64 and older relative to age 55. The right panel shows that while immigrants are more likely 
13:396:33695:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:than  natives  to  leave  the  sample  at  age  55  and  younger  (the  coefficient  on  the  foreign-born 
13:397:33802:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:dummy is negative and significant), that gap narrows at traditional retirement ages in the late 50s 
13:398:33902:21:20:72:542:232:12:Times:12:Times:and 60s. These results provide no evidence to suggest that immigrants are retiring abroad. These 
13:399:33999:20:21:72:542:212:12:Times:12:Times:results  are  far  from  definitive,  as  there  are  many  other reasons  why  people  might  leave  the 
13:400:34105:21:21:72:543:191:12:Times:12:Times:survey.  However,  given  how  little  is  known  about  where  immigrants  retire,  it  is  useful  to  learn 
13:401:34216:21:21:72:543:170:12:Times:12:Times:that this attrition indicator alone provides no evidence that immigrants leave the U.S. to retire in 
13:402:34317:21:20:72:284:149:12:Times:12:Times:their country of origin or another country.

14:406:34482:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:can  shed  further  light  on  the  behavior  of  immigrants  versus  natives.  Figures  4  and  5  report 
14:407:34589:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:retirement  and  claiming  hazards  with  both  the  foreign-born  and  native-born  sample  split  by 
14:408:34692:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanic  ethnicity.  Figures  6  and  7  report  similar  results  with  the  foreign-born  sample  split  by 
14:409:34803:21:20:72:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:whether  they  arrived  in  the  U.S.  before  or  after  age  40. Figure  8a shows  results  for  attrition 
14:410:34911:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:broken  down  by  Hispanic  ethnicity,  and  Figure 8b does  the  same  for  age  of arrival. In  each 
14:411:35013:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:figure,  the  top  left  panel  shows  the  coefficients  on  the  age  dummies  from  equation  (1)  for  the 
14:412:35124:21:20:72:542:563:12:Times:12:Times:omitted  base  group  (native  born  non-Hispanic  in  Figures  4, 5, and  8a; and  all  native  born  in 
14:413:35230:20:21:72:543:543:12:Times:12:Times:Figures  6, 7, and  8b).  The  omitted  age  category is  55 and  younger, represented  by the  constant 
14:414:35335:21:21:72:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:term. The remaining panels show coefficients on the interactions between the age dummies and 
14:415:35428:21:20:72:542:501:12:Times:12:Times:other  categories.  In  Figures  4,  5,  and  8a,  the  other  categories  include  native-born  Hispanic, 
14:416:35535:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:foreign-born  Hispanic,  and  foreign-born  non-Hispanic.  In Figures  6,  7,  and  8b,  the  other 
14:417:35635:21:21:72:543:460:12:Times:12:Times:categories  include  foreign-born  who  entered  before  age  40  and  foreign  born  who  entered  after 
14:418:35741:21:21:72:542:439:12:Times:12:Times:age  40.  The  constant  terms  in  these  remaining  panels represent  the  coefficient  on  the  relevant 
14:419:35849:21:20:72:542:418:12:Times:12:Times:foreign-born  sub-category  and  corresponds  to  the  impact  of  that  category  at  the  omitted  age 
14:420:35954:20:21:72:209:398:12:Times:12:Times:category of 55 and younger. 
14:421:35981:21:21:108:542:377:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 4a presents results for our first retirement indicator. The left panel shows that the 
14:422:36074:21:20:72:543:356:12:Times:12:Times:probability of retiring for non-Hispanic U.S. natives rises sharply in the early 60s (relative to 55 
14:423:36175:20:21:72:539:336:12:Times:12:Times:and younger). There are no statistically significant differences in retirement behavior when non-
14:424:36272:21:21:72:542:315:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanic U.S. natives are compared to Hispanic U.S. natives or Hispanic immigrants. However, 
14:425:36364:21:20:72:543:294:12:Times:12:Times:non-Hispanic immigrants are less likely than natives to retire at 62 (versus 55) and possibly more 
14:426:36463:20:21:72:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:likely  to  retire  after  full  retirement  age  (conditional  on  not  having  retired  by  then). Figure  4b 
14:427:36575:21:21:72:542:253:12:Times:12:Times:shows  results  for  our second  retirement  indicator,  and again  we  find  no  statistically  significant 
14:428:36683:21:20:72:543:232:12:Times:12:Times:differences   in   retirement   between   non-Hispanic   U.S.   natives   and   Hispanic   U.S.   natives. 
14:429:36790:20:21:72:542:212:12:Times:12:Times:However, Hispanic and non-Hispanic immigrants are less likely than non-Hispanic U.S. natives 
14:430:36883:21:21:72:542:191:12:Times:12:Times:to  retire  in  their  late  50s  and  early  60s. Figure 5  shows that  there  are  almost  no  statistically 
14:431:36992:21:21:72:543:170:12:Times:12:Times:significant differences (at the 5 percent level) in Social Security claiming between non-Hispanic 
14:432:37090:21:20:72:543:149:12:Times:12:Times:natives and Hispanic natives. Compared to these groups, Hispanic and non-Hispanic immigrants 
14:433:37183:20:21:72:317:129:12:Times:12:Times:are less likely to claim before full retirement age.   
14:434:37237:21:21:108:542:108:12:Times:12:Times: Figure 6 suggests that regardless of age of arrival, immigrants are less likely than natives 
14:435:37330:21:0:72:543:87:12:Times:12:Times:to retire in their late 50s or early 60s (relative to the omitted age group of 55 and below). These 
15:436:37432:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:results are stronger for the second definition of retirement. Figure 7 shows that regardless of the 
15:437:37530:20:21:72:543:688:12:Times:12:Times:age  when  immigrants  arrived,  they  are  less  likely  than  U.S.  natives  to  claim  at  Social  Security 
15:438:37641:21:21:72:543:667:12:Times:12:Times:early. Thus, it appears that nativity status is more important than either age of arrival or ethnicity 
15:439:37744:21:21:72:299:646:12:Times:12:Times:in driving retirement and claiming decisions.    
15:440:37792:21:20:108:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:Finally, Figures 8a and 8b suggest that the attrition gap between immigrants and natives 
15:441:37880:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:either  stays  the  same  or  narrows  at  traditional  retirement  ages  regardless  of  age  of  arrival  or 
15:442:37991:21:21:72:168:584:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanic ethnicity.

15:444:38011:20:21:72:147:543:12:Times:12:Times:5. Conclusion  
15:445:38025:21:21:108:543:522:12:Times:12:Times:This paper provides descriptive evidence of immigrant-native differences in the timing of 
15:446:38115:21:20:72:543:501:12:Times:12:Times:retirement and Social Security claiming. We show that immigrants are less likely than natives to 
15:447:38212:20:21:72:543:481:12:Times:12:Times:retire  or  claim  Social  Security  early.  Our  analysis  does  not  allow  us  to  determine  what  causes 
15:448:38322:21:21:72:542:460:12:Times:12:Times:these differences. In fact, there are several plausible explanations. First, immigrants may be less 
15:449:38422:21:21:72:542:439:12:Times:12:Times:prepared for retirement. Our regressions control for household wealth in the baseline wave, and 
15:450:38518:21:20:72:542:418:12:Times:12:Times:controlling  for  wealth  does  not  alter  our  key  results.  This  finding  suggests  that retirement 
15:451:38623:20:21:72:543:398:12:Times:12:Times:preparedness may not be driving the differences we find. However, our measure of wealth is not 
15:452:38718:21:21:72:542:377:12:Times:12:Times:comprehensive,  as  it  does  not  include defined  benefit  pensions  or Social  Security  wealth,  or 
15:453:38821:21:20:72:542:356:12:Times:12:Times:access  to  pre-Medicare  non-employment-based  health  insurance.  Second,  because  of  the  Social 
15:454:38923:20:21:72:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:Security benefit formula – which is based on the highest 35 years of earnings – immigrants are 
15:455:39016:21:21:72:543:315:12:Times:12:Times:more  likely  than  natives  to  receive  a  substantial  boost  to  their  Social  Security  benefits  from 
15:456:39125:21:20:72:542:294:12:Times:12:Times:additional years  of  work.  Third,  immigrants  may  differ  from  natives  in  terms  of  health  status. 
15:457:39233:20:21:72:542:274:12:Times:12:Times:The  generally  lower  self-reported  health  of  immigrants would  suggest  that  immigrants  retire 
15:458:39335:21:21:72:543:253:12:Times:12:Times:earlier  than  natives,  which  is  contrary  to  our  findings.  Moreover,  controlling  for  self-reported 
15:459:39444:21:20:72:543:232:12:Times:12:Times:health does not alter our findings. We have obviously not controlled for all unobservable aspects 
15:460:39542:20:21:72:543:212:12:Times:12:Times:of  health.  As  noted  earlier,  immigrants  do  tend  to  have  lower  mortality  than  natives  even  after 
15:461:39653:21:21:72:543:191:12:Times:12:Times:controlling  for  observables,  and  lower  mortality  may  indicate  an  aspect  of  health  that  is  not 
15:462:39761:21:21:72:542:170:12:Times:12:Times:captured  by  our self-reported  health measure.  If  immigrants  retire  later  than  natives,  it  is  not 
15:463:39870:21:20:72:543:149:12:Times:12:Times:surprising that they also claim Social Security later, as claiming Social Security upon retirement 
15:464:39969:20:21:72:542:129:12:Times:12:Times:is a common practice. Delaying claiming is also consistent with the lower mortality experienced 
15:465:40064:21:21:72:542:108:12:Times:12:Times:by  immigrants.  Finally, we  show  that  immigrants  are  not  more  likely  than  natives  to  exit  the 
15:466:40170:21:0:72:543:87:12:Times:12:Times:survey at traditional retirement ages in the late 50s and 60s. In the absence of better data, these 
16:467:40271:0:20:72:543:708:12:Times:12:Times:attrition  rates  are  a  good  starting  point  to  better  understand  where  immigrants  are  choosing  to 
16:468:40381:20:21:72:106:688:12:Times:12:Times:retire.  
16:469:40389:21:21:108:542:667:12:Times:12:Times:These  results  have  implications  for  the  retirement  security  and  general  well-being  of 
16:470:40486:21:21:72:543:646:12:Times:12:Times:immigrants. While  delaying  both  retirement  and  Social  Security  claiming  can  have  a  large 
16:471:40586:21:20:72:542:625:12:Times:12:Times:impact on retirement standard of living, differences in the length of retirement may represent an 
16:472:40684:20:21:72:543:605:12:Times:12:Times:inequity  that  policy  makers  care  about.  Retirement  and  claiming  choices  also  have  important 
16:473:40788:21:21:72:543:584:12:Times:12:Times:implications  for  the  finances  of  Social  Security,  and  the  public  sector  budget  more  generally. 
16:474:40896:21:20:72:543:563:12:Times:12:Times:Finally,   beginning   to   understand   where   immigrants   might   retire   has   important   financial 
16:475:41003:20:0:72:539:543:12:Times:12:Times:implications for both the host and source countries.
