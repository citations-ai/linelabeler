2:29:1378:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper develops a model of global sourcing with culturally dissimilar countries. Production of
2:30:1476:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:final goods requires  the coordination of decisions between the headquarter of a multinational firm
2:31:1575:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:and managers of their component suppliers. Managers of both units are assumed to have strong beliefs
2:32:1675:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:about the right course of action and are reluctant to adjust their decisions. We characterize the optimal
2:33:1780:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:allocation of decision rights across firms when contracts are incomplete. Our theoretical model delivers
2:34:1884:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:two key predictions: the incentive of a firm to integrate (rather than outsource) its input supply is decreasing
2:35:1996:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:in the cultural distance between the home and the host country and decreasing in trade costs between
2:36:2096:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:the two countries. Combining data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade with various
2:37:2192:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:measures for cultural distance and trade cost, we find empirical evidence strongly supportive of these
2:38:2294:14:42:72:149:462:12:Times:12:Times:two predictions.

3:59:2734:0:32:70:200:759:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:60:2749:32:21:70:538:727:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Whenever managers of multinational companies are asked about the challenges of globaliza-
3:61:2838:21:20:70:538:706:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion to their businesses, keywords like ‘cultural differences’ or ‘intercultural communication’
3:62:2933:20:20:70:538:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are among the most frequently given answers. For instance, a global survey of 572 executives
3:63:3025:20:20:70:538:666:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (2012) reports ‘differences in cultural tradi-
3:64:3116:20:21:70:538:646:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tions’ to be the greatest obstacle to productive cross-border collaboration. Not surprisingly,
3:65:3210:21:20:70:538:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:courses on intercultural communication have become indispensable components of most (if
3:66:3297:20:20:70:538:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not all) business programs around the world and the impact of cultural differences on com-
3:67:3387:20:20:70:538:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mercial transactions is widely explored in the business literature. Yet, the effect of cultural
3:68:3482:20:21:70:520:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differences in international business transactions remains mostly ignored by economists.
3:69:3570:21:20:88:538:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper aims at shedding light, both theoretically and empirically, on the effects of
3:70:3658:20:20:70:538:524:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:problems of cultural communication across countries on the organization of global sourcing.
3:71:3749:20:20:70:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In particular, we investigate how national cultural distance, defined as the extent to which the
3:72:3845:20:20:70:538:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shared values and norms in one country differ from those in another, affects the managerial
3:73:3936:20:21:70:538:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decision whether to integrate a foreign supplier into a multinational firm’s boundaries or to
3:74:4029:21:20:70:538:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cooperate with the latter at arm’s length. The basic trade-off analyzed in this paper is as
3:75:4120:20:20:70:538:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:follows: Integration leads to a better coordination of decisions across firm units and a higher
3:76:4215:20:20:70:538:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:monetary payoff to the headquarter manager, but is associated with a loss in the latter’s
3:77:4304:20:21:70:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:non-monetary job satisfaction as a result of frictions within the integrated firm. Given that
3:78:4397:21:20:70:538:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these frictions are likely to be amplified by managerial cultural differences, this paper argues
3:79:4493:20:20:70:513:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the prevalence of integration decreases in the cultural distance between countries.
3:80:4581:20:20:88:538:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:It is particularly interesting to study the effect of culture in the context of multinational
3:81:4674:20:20:70:538:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enterprises rather than that of exporting or importing firms, for two reasons. First, since
3:82:4765:20:21:70:538:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a multinational firm “controls and manages production establishments (plants) located in
3:83:4853:21:20:70:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at least two countries” (Caves 2007:  1), managers of multinational firms are inevitably
3:84:4941:20:20:70:538:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:confronted with the issue of cross-cultural collaboration. Second, multinational firms play
3:85:5032:20:20:70:538:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a major role in the global economy. According to the UNCTAD (2011) World Investment
3:86:5115:20:21:70:538:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Report, multinational enterprises account for one-quarter of world GDP. Roughly one-third
3:87:5204:21:20:70:538:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the volume of world trade is intra-firm trade. Moreover, roughly another third of world
3:88:5294:20:20:70:538:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trade is accounted for by transactions in which multinational firms are one of the two sides
3:89:5386:20:20:70:271:140:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:of the exchange, see UNCTAD (2000).1
3:90:5422:20:36:88:538:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Culture is generally defined as the set of values and beliefs, which are shared by a com-
3:91:5511:36:16:70:538:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:1In case of the U.S., the role of multinationals is even more significant. Roughly 90 percent of U.S. exports
3:92:5620:16:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and imports flow through multinational firms, and nearly one-half of U.S. imports are transacted within
3:93:5723:12:0:91:538:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:boundaries of multinational firms rather than across unaffiliated parties, see Antràs and Yeaple (2014).
4:94:5828:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:munity and are persistent over time. There is by now a rapidly expanding literature (see,
4:95:5917:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:e.g. Fernandez et al. 2004, Fernandez 2010, Guiso et al. (2003, 2006, 2009), Gorodnichenko
4:96:6007:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Roland (2010, 2011), Tabellini (2008, 2010), Alesina et al. 2013, Alesina and Giuliano
4:97:6097:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2015), analyzing the impact of culture on various economic outcomes. Yet, to the best of
4:98:6185:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:our knowledge, the impact of culture on the organization of multinational firms and on their
4:99:6277:21:20:70:438:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:outsourcing decisions has not been explored in the economics literature.
4:100:6349:20:20:88:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To address our research question, we need a theory of a multinational firm’s boundaries
4:101:6436:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that incorporates frictions between managers of different cultures. We build on the recent
4:102:6526:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:theory of the firm by Hart and Holmström (2010). Their approach moves the focus away
4:103:6610:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the canonical property rights theory by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore
4:104:6698:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1900) – which emphasizes the role of non-human assets in determining a firm’s boundaries
4:105:6787:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:– towards a theory that highlights the role of managers in making strategic coordination
4:106:6875:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decisions across firm units. A key feature of their approach is the assumption that managers
4:107:6967:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enjoy two kinds of benefits: monetary profits and private non-monetary benefits (or job
4:108:7054:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:satisfaction). The latter benefits are usually modeled as exogenous parameters. Instead,
4:109:7142:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we endogenize job satisfaction in our model and assume that it depends negatively on the
4:110:7230:20:20:70:446:435:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:frictions created by the cultural distance between cooperating managers.2
4:111:7303:20:20:88:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:On that basis, we develop a theoretical model of global sourcing that features vertical
4:112:7390:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fragmentation of the production process as in Antràs and Helpman (2004), firm heterogene-
4:113:7479:21:20:70:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ity along the lines of Melitz (2003), and cross-country heterogeneity with regard to national
4:114:7572:20:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultural values.  Production of final goods requires cooperation of two units: headquar-
4:115:7660:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ters and manufacturing suppliers, which provide headquarter services and manufacturing
4:116:7746:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:components, respectively. Each unit is led by a single owner-manager, who is in charge of
4:117:7835:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:coordinating strategic decisions (e.g., technological standards or the degree of relationship-
4:118:7929:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specificity of inputs) across units. It is assumed that managers of both units have strong
4:119:8019:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:beliefs about the right course of action and these beliefs differ. Hence, from a managerial
4:120:8110:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:perspective, coordination of decisions across units is associated with a fundamental trade-
4:121:8201:20:21:70:538:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:off. On the one hand, better coordination leads to a higher quality of final goods and larger
4:122:8294:21:20:70:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managerial profits. On the other hand, deviation from one’s most preferred vision and con-
4:123:8384:20:20:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vergence towards the decision of the cooperation partner reduces a manager’s non-monetary
4:124:8473:20:20:70:538:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:job satisfaction. The decision-making process crucially depends on the firm’s organizational
4:125:8565:20:36:70:538:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:form.  If the two units are not integrated, each unit’s manager makes strategic decisions
4:126:8654:36:16:70:538:96:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:2Both the business literature and press are rife with anecdotes about challenges encountered by managers
4:127:8758:16:12:91:538:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:working in foreign cultural environments. Several recent empirical contributions have tried to quantify
4:128:8861:12:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:this anecdotal evidence by establishing a negative link between cultural distance and job satisfaction of
4:129:8966:12:0:91:337:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:expatriates, cf., e.g., Froese and Peltokorpi (2011, 2012).
5:130:9026:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:solely in his own unit. Under integration, the manager of the supply unit becomes a sub-
5:131:9114:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ordinate of the headquarter unit and has to follow the latter’s instructions. To the extent
5:132:9205:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the enacted decision deviates from the supply unit manager’s most preferred vision,
5:133:9293:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:he experiences a loss in non-monetary job satisfaction.  We follow Hart and Holmström
5:134:9378:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2010) by assuming that an aggrieved subordinate-manager may ‘transfer the hurt back’ by
5:135:9466:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reducing a supervisor’s job satisfaction. From the viewpoint of the headquarter manager,
5:136:9554:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the make-or-buy decision is thus associated with a simple trade-off: Integration leads to a
5:137:9645:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:better coordination of decisions across units and higher monetary profits at the expense of
5:138:9736:20:20:70:383:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a non-monetary cost of enacting decisions in the supply unit.
5:139:9797:20:21:88:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:How do we introduce culture in the model? The decision by the headquarter manager
5:140:9878:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whether to source components from an independent or from an integrated supplier depends
5:141:9965:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the effect of cross-cultural communication on his private non-monetary benefits. We show
5:142:10056:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that component suppliers are more likely to be integrated into firm boundaries when their
5:143:10145:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultural distance to the headquarters is smaller. Intuitively, as cultural distance increases,
5:144:10239:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:it becomes increasingly hard for a manager of an integrated firm to enact his most preferred
5:145:10331:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decisions in a supply unit. If the associated loss in non-monetary job satisfaction outweighs
5:146:10424:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the monetary benefit of integration stemming from better coordination of decisions, the
5:147:10511:20:20:70:484:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:headquarter manager may decide to cooperate with the supplier at arm’s length.
5:148:10589:20:21:88:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Apart from this central finding, our model delivers the following three results.  First,
5:149:10677:21:20:70:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we show that better coordination of strategic decisions under integration results in a higher
5:150:10770:20:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quality of final goods as compared to outsourcing. Second, the higher the firm’s productivity
5:151:10863:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the more likely managers of multinational firms are to integrate their suppliers into the firm
5:152:10957:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rather than cooperating with them at arm’s length. The intuition behind this result lies in the
5:153:11052:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supermodularity of profits in productivity and final goods quality. Since higher productivity
5:154:11145:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:allows firms to reap higher profits, headquarter managers get a greater incentive to increase
5:155:11238:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the quality of final goods by bringing their suppliers inside the firm’s boundaries. Third, the
5:156:11333:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher the trade costs between the two countries the less likely a foreign supplier is to be
5:157:11425:20:21:70:538:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:integrated. This result is driven by the submodularity of profits in variable trade cost and
5:158:11517:21:20:70:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:final goods quality. Intuitively, higher trade costs decrease operating profits and, thereby,
5:159:11610:20:20:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduce the marginal gain from improving the final goods quality. As a result, the incentive
5:160:11701:20:20:70:441:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to enhance coordination across units by integrating a supplier decreases.
5:161:11774:20:21:88:538:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:All three above-mentioned theoretical propositions find strong empirical support. First,
5:162:11862:21:20:70:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:there is a broad consensus in the business literature that integration of an independent
5:163:11950:20:20:70:538:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supplier into the firm boundaries increases the quality of goods or services. The Deloitte
5:164:12040:20:0:70:538:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2012) Global Outsourcing and Insourcing Survey reports unsatisfactory quality to be the
6:165:12129:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the major factor in the decision to terminate an existing arm’s-length relationship. Moreover,
6:166:12223:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:almost all of the surveyed firms that switched from outsourcing to integration were satisfied
6:167:12316:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the result in terms of improved quality.3Second, using firm-level data, several studies
6:168:12408:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have shown that firms engaged in foreign vertical integration appear to be more productive
6:169:12498:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than those undertaking foreign outsourcing (see Corcos et al., 2013 for France; Kohler and
6:170:12588:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Smolka, 2009 for Spain, and Tomiura, 2007 for Japan). Third, Antràs (2015) and Corcos et
6:171:12676:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:al. (2013) provide supportive evidence for our hypothesis of a negative effect of trade costs
6:172:12769:20:20:70:145:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on integration.
6:173:12784:20:20:88:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Yet, our central result – the effect of cultural distance on the international make-or-buy
6:174:12874:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decision – has not been empirically analyzed. We bring this prediction to the data by study-
6:175:12966:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing the sourcing decisions of U.S. firms. Following Nunn and Trefler (2008, 2013), we use
6:176:13055:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as dependent variable U.S. intra-firm imports as a share of total U.S. imports from the U.S.
6:177:13147:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Census Bureau’s Related Party Trade dataset.4A high share of intra-firm imports reflects a
6:178:13237:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:greater willingness of US firms to obtain an ownership or control stake in foreign suppliers
6:179:13329:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instead of buying intermediate goods at arm’s length. Our key explanatory cultural variable
6:180:13420:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is Hofstede’s (2001) well-known individualism-collectivism index, generally considered to be
6:181:13512:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the main dimension of cultural variation across countries (see, e.g., Heine, 2007). As the
6:182:13602:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:US is the most individualistic country according to Hofstede’s measurement, and since we
6:183:13690:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are looking at cultural distance between the US and its trade partners, the individualism-
6:184:13780:21:20:70:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:collectivism index provides a convenient measure of cultural distance. We find indeed that
6:185:13870:20:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:there is a negative and significant relationship between a country’s cultural distance to the
6:186:13963:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:US and the share of intra-firm imports in total U.S. imports from this country, using a wide
6:187:14055:20:21:70:202:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:range of control variables.
6:188:14082:21:20:88:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While it is quite plausible that cultural distance affects decisions to integrate firms, it
6:189:14173:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:may also be the case, albeit to a lesser extent, that the presence of US firms in a country
6:190:14264:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduces cultural distance with managers working in those US firms. It may even be the case
6:191:14354:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that a large presence of US firms in a country may reduce cultural distance between that
6:192:14442:20:21:70:538:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country and the US. In order to infer acausaleffect of cultural distance, we then follow
6:193:14530:21:20:70:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two alternative identification strategies. First, we apply instrumental variables approach,
6:194:14621:20:40:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereby cultural distance is instrumented by the genetic distance between the population
6:195:14709:40:16:70:538:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:3There is also a wealth of anecdotal evidence suggesting a link between make-or-buy decision and quality.
6:196:14814:16:12:91:538:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:For instance, outsourcing of more than 60% of components of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to independent
6:197:14914:12:12:91:538:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:producers is considered to be one of the major reasons for poor quality and for almost four years of
6:198:15014:12:8:91:314:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:delay of the final good, see e.g., Tang et al. (2009).
6:199:15068:8:16:70:538:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:4Given that comprehensive firm-level data on integration decisions is not readily available, this product-
6:200:15174:16:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:level dataset has been extensively used in the empirical literature to study international make-or-buy
6:201:15276:12:0:91:239:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:decisions, cf. Antràs (2013, 2015).
7:202:15312:0:21:70:537:759:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:in a given country and the population in the U.S., as in Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011).5
7:203:15402:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given that genetic distance is exogenous to the firms’ make-or-buy decisions, our instrument
7:204:15494:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:satisfies the exclusion restriction. Second, we construct an alternative measure for cultural
7:205:15587:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance based on ethnic composition of U.S. industries. More specifically, we use the 2000
7:206:15678:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:U.S. Census data to calculate for each industry the shares of managers with a given cultural
7:207:15770:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:background and then uses weights to compute industry-specific cultural scores. Both iden-
7:208:15859:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tification strategies confirm the negative impact of cultural distance on intra-firm imports
7:209:15951:20:20:70:244:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:found in simple linear regressions.
7:210:15986:20:20:88:538:597:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:Related literature.From a theoretical perspective, our paper is closely related to the
7:211:16072:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:seminal contribution by Antràs and Helpman (2004), who study the international make-
7:212:16156:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or-buy decision in a framework with monopolistic competition, contractual incompleteness,
7:213:16245:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and firm-level heterogeneity. Their framework is centered on the property rights approach
7:214:16334:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:along the lines of Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990). In contrast, we
7:215:16420:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:emphasize the effect of cultural distance between managers on the internalization decision,
7:216:16511:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and our framework borrows from Hart and Holmström’s (2010) theory of the firm.6To
7:217:16592:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be clear, the findings of our paper do not contradict but rather complement the results
7:218:16679:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by Antràs and Helpman (2004). Moreover, our empirical analysis suggests that these two
7:219:16765:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:alternative explanations of multinational firms’ boundaries simultaneously hold. We return
7:220:16855:20:21:70:225:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to this issue in the conclusion.
7:221:16887:21:20:88:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:From an empirical perspective, our paper is related to the burgeoning literature that aims
7:222:16977:20:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at understanding the effect of culture on international trade and foreign direct investment.
7:223:17069:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Using data from the Eurovision Song Context, Felbermayr and Toubal (2010) construct a
7:224:17154:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measure of cultural proximity and show a strong positive effect of this measure on trade
7:225:17242:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:volumes. Using historically motivated instrumental variables, Siegel et al. (2011, 2012) find
7:226:17335:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a negative causal effect of egalitarianism distance – defined as the difference in the belief
7:227:17428:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that all people are of equal worth and should be treated equally in society – on foreign direct
7:228:17523:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:investment flows, cross-national flows of bond and equity issuances, syndicated loans, and
7:229:17613:20:21:70:538:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mergers and acquisitions. Guiso et al. (2009) construct a measure of bilateral trust between
7:230:17705:21:20:70:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:European countries and instrument it with religious, genetic, and somatic similarities to
7:231:17794:20:20:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:show that lower bilateral trust leads to less trade and less direct and portfolio investment
7:232:17886:20:20:70:538:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between two countries. Yet, none of these empirical studies considers the effect of cultural

7:234:18078:16:8:91:286:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:individualistic country in Hofstede’s dataset.

7:236:18220:16:12:91:538:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to the context of international trade in order to study the effect of liberalization of product and factor
7:237:18326:12:12:91:538:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:markets on the organization of the firms. Both the focus and the approach of the current paper, however,
7:238:18430:12:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:are different. Our aim is to understand the effect of cultural distance on the international make-or-buy
7:239:18534:12:0:91:230:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:decisions of multinational firms.
8:240:18568:0:21:70:333:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance on the international make-or-buy decision.
8:241:18619:21:20:88:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:By putting managers into the center of our analysis, this paper is also related to the

8:243:18795:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:performance. Several empirical studies have shown a causal effect of successful managerial
8:244:18885:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:practices on firm performance (see, e.g., surveys by Bloom and Van Reenen 2010, Gibbons
8:245:18972:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Roberts 2013, and Syverson 2011). In a recent empirical study, Bloom et al. (2013)
8:246:19058:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also find that cross-country differences in managerial practices may explain a substantial
8:247:19148:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction of heterogeneity in total factor productivity across nations. Yet, there is a large
8:248:19240:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consensus in the sociological literature that managerial behavior itself is a function of a
8:249:19331:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country’s cultural values (see, e.g., Sagiv et al., 2010 for an overview of this literature). We
8:250:19427:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relate these two independent literature strands by showing how cultural differences shape
8:251:19516:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managerial behavior and, thereby, affect both a firm’s performance and the attractiveness
8:252:19605:20:20:70:365:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of countries from the viewpoint of international investors.

8:257:20031:49:32:70:151:386:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:2  Set-up
8:258:20040:32:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our model economy consists of a home country,N, and many foreign countries,`.  All
8:259:20122:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:countries have identical consumer preferences. Foreign countries`differ with regard to their
8:260:20214:20:20:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:geographical and cultural distance toN. Each country is populated by a unit measure of
8:261:20300:20:21:70:538:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consumers. Each consumer is endowed with a unit of inelastically supplied labor. A subset
8:262:20389:21:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of individuals also possess leadership abilities, which allow them to become entrepreneurs.
8:263:20480:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For simplicity, we assume that each firm is operated by a single owner-manager. There are
8:264:20569:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two types of firms: headquarters and manufacturing suppliers. Headquarters are located in
8:265:20658:20:21:70:486:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the home country, while manufacturing suppliers are located in foreign countries.

9:289:21364:21:20:88:538:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As will be shown further below, these non-homothetic preferences imply a linear rela-
9:290:21449:20:20:70:538:644:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tionship between consumer’s income and utility. Following Hart and Holmström (2010), we
9:291:21536:20:20:70:538:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assume that managers derive their utility not only from the monetary payoff but also from a
9:292:21627:20:20:70:538:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:non-monetary job satisfaction.7This notion is reflected through1i=H,M, an indicator func-
9:293:21716:20:21:70:538:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion which takes the value one if an individualiis a manager and zero otherwise, whereby
9:294:21804:21:20:70:538:563:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:Hdenotes a manager of a headquarter unit andMrepresents a manager of a supplier firm
9:295:21888:20:20:70:538:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(see below). The expression in parentheses denotes private job satisfaction. In the spirit
9:296:21978:20:20:70:538:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of Hart and Holmström (2010), we subdivide this private benefit into two components: in-
9:297:22066:20:21:70:538:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trinsic,jinti, and extrinsic,jexti.8The intrinsic component of job satisfaction stems from the
9:298:22160:21:20:70:538:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pleasure a manager gets from working on the task itself and from the feeling of accomplish-
9:299:22251:20:20:70:538:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ment, whereas its extrinsic component stems from the factors bestowed upon an individual
9:300:22339:20:20:70:538:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by peers (e.g. a friendly working atmosphere, respect of co-workers etc.). Both components
9:301:22429:20:21:70:538:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the non-monetary job-satisfaction are assumed to enter a manager’s utility function in a
9:302:22520:21:20:70:538:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:linearly additive way.9However, in our model, job satisfaction is endogenous. Functional
9:303:22608:20:20:70:315:381:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:forms forjintiandjextiwill be introduced below.

9:327:23209:49:16:70:538:120:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:7Although we confine our analysis of non-monetary benefits strictly to managers, our model can be
9:328:23306:16:8:91:374:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:extended so as to incorporate employees’ job satisfaction as well.
9:329:23372:8:12:70:538:96:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:8This conceptualization is widely used in organization science, see e.g., Naumann (1993a), Staw (1989).
9:330:23475:12:12:70:532:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:9In fact, this is a standard working assumption in the organizational literature, cf. Naumann (1993b).
9:331:23577:12:16:70:538:72:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:10We assume sufficiently small preferences for differentiated goods (i.e.,μ < Yi) to ensure positive con-
9:332:23682:16:0:91:301:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:sumption of the traditional good in equilibrium.

10:334:23809:21:20:70:527:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Throughout the analysis,Wiwill be used as the welfare function of a manageri=H,M.
10:335:23890:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:Production.The traditional good is produced in all countries under constant returns to
10:336:23976:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:scale and perfect competition. This good will be chosen as the numéraire. Production of
10:337:24063:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:one unit of output requiresaNunits of labor in the home country andal< aNlabor units in
10:338:24150:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the foreign country (i.e. workers inNare assumed to be more productive than in any foreign
10:339:24240:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country`). This numéraire good is assumed to be costlessly traded, implying the same unit
10:340:24329:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price in all regions. Consequently, the model exhibits a constant wage differential between
10:341:24420:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the home country and foreign destinations:wN> w`. For simplicity, we normalize the wage
10:342:24507:20:21:70:211:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate inNto unity,wN= 1.
10:343:24530:21:20:88:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Production of differentiated varieties exhibits monopolistic competition, whereby each
10:344:24616:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variety is produced by a single firm under increasing returns to scale. As in Melitz (2003),
10:345:24708:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firms are heterogeneous with respect to the productivity.  To start the production of a
10:346:24795:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:varietyv, a headquarter firm has to bear a fixed cost of entry, consisting offEunits of local
10:347:24888:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:labor. Upon paying these fixed costs, the firm draws a productivity levelθfrom a known
10:348:24974:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distribution functionG(φ).  Afterθis revealed, the headquarters decide whether to exit
10:349:25060:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the market or start producing. Production of final goods requires the cooperation of two
10:350:25148:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:units: the headquarter firm and manufacturing suppliers. Each unit is operated by a single
10:351:25238:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owner-manager. The manager of the headquarter and manufacturing unit will be referred
10:352:25323:21:20:70:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to asHandM, respectively. Headquarter units specialize in the provision of headquarter

10:367:25846:20:20:70:538:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across all firms. To simplify on notation, we drop the variety-indexvfrom here onward and

10:369:25973:21:20:88:538:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As mentioned above, we assume that all headquarters are located in the home country,
10:370:26057:20:20:70:538:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereas manufacturing suppliers are located in foreign countries.11After manufacturing
10:371:26143:20:18:70:538:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:components have been produced, they are shipped toNfor final assembly, (see equation
10:372:26227:18:16:70:538:96:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:11Our framework can be easily extended to the case in which manufacturing units are located both in

10:374:26426:12:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and Helpman (2004). However, given that we do not observe this internationalization margin in the
10:375:26523:12:0:91:504:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:dataset used in the subsequent empirical analysis, we rule out domestic sourcing at the outset.
11:376:26619:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(5)).  Transportation of manufacturing inputs from country`toNinvolves iceberg-type

11:378:26793:20:20:70:112:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:barriers.
11:379:26802:20:20:88:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In contrast to Antràs and Helpman (2004), we assume that parties can write enforceable
11:380:26888:20:21:70:539:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contracts on thequantityof inputshandm. This assumption is made to eliminate the well-
11:381:26974:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:known channel of inefficiencies stemming from the ex post hold-up and the associated ex ante
11:382:27066:20:20:70:539:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underinvestment in inputs. Yet, we assume that the final-goodsqualitycannot be verified by
11:383:27156:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the courts. In our model, the quality of final goods depends on the managerial coordination
11:384:27247:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of strategic decisions across units (e.g., adoption of a common technological standard or
11:385:27336:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:platform). For simplicity, we normalize the set of possible coordination decisions to a unit
11:386:27428:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f10:interval and denote byα∈[0,1]decisions made in the headquarters’ unit and byβ∈[0,1]
11:387:27511:20:20:70:324:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decisions implemented in the manufacturing firm.
11:388:27559:20:20:88:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ManagersHandMare assumed to have differing visions about the right course of action.
11:389:27643:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:More specifically,Hprefersαto be as high as possible, whileMprefers the smallest possi-
11:390:27730:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bleβ. This assumption can be rationalized by invoking the issue of relationship-specificity:
11:391:27822:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While final good producers might seek to adopt a specific production technology (e.g., to
11:392:27911:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:set themselves apart from competitors), manufacturing suppliers prefer to operate under a
11:393:28000:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:general technology (which would increase their outside option and/or allow them to serve
11:394:28088:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:multiple final good producers). For production to be efficient, it does not matter which par-
11:395:28181:21:20:70:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ticular decisions are chosen in both units, as long as these decisions are perfectly coordinated
11:396:28277:20:37:70:457:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:across firms. We thus assume the quality function takes the following form:
11:397:28352:37:37:260:538:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:q= 1−(α−β)2,(6)
11:398:28367:37:20:70:539:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereby the quality of a final good is highest (qmax= 1) for any combination ofα=β(i.e.
11:399:28454:20:20:70:448:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:perfect coordination across units) and it is decreasing asαandβdiverge.
11:400:28525:20:21:88:538:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given that managers have strong diverging beliefs about the right course of actions, coor-
11:401:28615:21:20:70:538:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dination of decisions across units leads to a reduction in managerial intrinsic job satisfaction.
11:402:28712:20:20:70:538:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The marginal decrease in intrinsic job satisfaction is highest, the more a manager departs
11:403:28802:20:20:70:538:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from his most preferred decision (i.e.α=  1forHandβ=  0forM).  We choose the
11:404:28878:20:20:70:538:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simplest possible way to introduce these assumptions into the managerial utility function by
11:405:28970:20:37:70:385:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capturing the intrinsic private cost of coordination as follows:
11:406:29034:37:37:219:538:102:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:jintH=−(1−α)2,  jintM=−β2.(7)
11:407:29063:37:0:88:538:65:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Apart from the non-monetary intrinsic cost from cooperation, managerial job satisfac-
12:408:29149:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion also includes an extrinsic component, which stems from the factors bestowed upon an
12:409:29237:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:individual by peers. We assume that the ability of a manager to affect the other manager’s
12:410:29327:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:job satisfaction crucially depends on the ownership structure of a firm. If the two units are

12:412:29500:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unit. Given that an arm’s-length transaction amounts to a purchase of manufacturing in-
12:413:29587:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:puts according to ex ante specified conditions, managers have a limited ability to affect each
12:414:29681:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:others extrinsic job satisfaction. For simplicity, we normalize both managers’ extrinsic job
12:415:29773:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:satisfaction under outsourcing to zero. By integrating a manufacturing supplier into firm
12:416:29862:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:boundaries, however,Hobtains residual control rights to make decisions in both units and
12:417:29950:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:MbecomesH’s subordinate. More specifically,Hinstructs the manager of an integrated

12:419:30117:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tions. However, to the extent the decision implemented in the manufacturing unit deviates
12:420:30206:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fromM’s most preferred agenda (β= 0),Mis aggrieved and can ‘transfer the hurt back’
12:421:30289:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:toHby reducing the latter’s extrinsic job satisfaction.12As before, we normalize the upper
12:422:30379:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bound of headquarter manager’s extrinsic job satisfaction to zero and captureH’s extrinsic
12:423:30469:20:37:70:278:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:private cost under integration as follows:

12:426:30609:20:20:70:538:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:manager and the supply unit manager in country`. Intuitively, the larger the cultural dis-

12:429:30793:21:20:88:538:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We assume that the contracting parties agree in advance on the future division of sur-

12:432:31049:20:21:70:538:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managers stipulate ex ante the surplus sharing rule: Under outsourcing, the headquarter
12:433:31136:21:20:70:538:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:managerHobtains a shares∈(0,1)of the operating profit, whereas the remaining share
12:434:31218:20:20:70:539:199:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f2:(1−s)accrues to the managerMof the manufacturing firm. For simplicity, we assume that
12:435:31303:20:20:70:538:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these shares are identical for allHandM. Under integration,Hdiverts the entire operating

12:438:31512:31:16:70:538:108:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:12A natural question that arises in this context is whyMis kept as a subordinate under integration
12:439:31610:16:12:91:538:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:despite the extrinsic private cost from instructing this manager. This assumption can be justified by
12:440:31711:12:8:91:498:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:referring toM’s intangible capital or specific know-how of governing the manufacturing unit.
12:441:31803:8:16:70:538:72:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:13In view of the fact that most, if not all, real-world commercial contracts include (some kind of) speci-
12:442:31909:16:0:91:374:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:fication for future compensation, this assumption seems realistic.

16:611:37522:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:outsourcing, while those with productivity above this cutoff integrate their suppliers into
16:612:37613:20:20:70:154:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm boundaries.
16:613:37629:20:20:70:202:597:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:Proof.See Appendix A.1.
16:614:37652:20:21:88:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The intuition behind this Lemma lies in the supermodularity of profits in productivity
16:615:37738:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and final goods quality (see equation (11)). An improvement in final goods quality leads to
16:616:37829:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a larger increase in profits the higher a firm’s productivity. SinceH’s welfare is a function of
16:617:37925:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the firm’s profits, managers of more productive firms have the highest incentive to increase
16:618:38017:20:21:70:512:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the quality of final goods by integrating manufacturing suppliers into firm boundaries.
16:619:38104:21:20:88:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Apart from firm-specific productivity, a firm’s integration decision also depends on two
16:620:38192:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country-specific factors. A simple differentiation of (22) implies thatΩ`is decreasing inc`.
16:621:38284:20:20:70:139:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We thus have
16:622:38296:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f26:12:g_d0_f2:Proposition 1.Final good producers are more likely to integrate their foreign suppliers
16:623:38383:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:into the firm’s boundaries instead of cooperating with them at arm’s-length if the cultural
16:624:38474:21:20:70:295:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance between the two countries is lower.

16:630:38593:16:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To infer the intuition behind this result, recall the key tradeoff between integration and out-
16:631:38688:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sourcing from the viewpoint of a headquarter manager: compared to outsourcing, integration
16:632:38778:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:leads to a higher monetary payoff but is associated with a loss in extrinsic job satisfaction
16:633:38871:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(see equation (8)). Given that this non-monetary cost is increasing inc`, integration becomes
16:634:38964:20:20:70:530:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively less attractive as cultural distance between the managers of two units increases.
16:635:39056:20:20:88:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Furthermore, the internalization decision depends on the trade cost between`andN.
16:636:39137:20:21:70:414:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We show in Appendix A.2 thatΩ`is decreasing inτ`. This implies

16:638:39280:20:20:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:producers are likely to integrate their foreign suppliers into the firm’s boundaries instead of
16:639:39375:20:20:70:272:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cooperating with them at arm’s-length.
16:640:39413:20:21:70:202:132:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:Proof.See Appendix A.2.
16:641:39436:21:20:70:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The intuition behind this result relates to the fact that profits are submodular in trade cost
16:642:39530:20:20:70:538:91:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:τ`and final goods quality (see (11) and (12)). In other words, as trade costs decrease, the
16:643:39621:20:0:70:538:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marginal increase in firm’s profits due to an improvement of final goods quality increases.
17:644:39714:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Given thatH’s welfare is a function of the firm’s profits, the incentive of the headquarter

17:649:39940:27:21:70:538:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To test the predictions of our theoretical framework, we pool together several datasets. To
17:650:40031:21:20:70:538:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measure the extent to which multinational firms integrate their foreign supplies rather than
17:651:40123:20:20:70:538:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cooperate with them at arm’s-length, we use the “U.S. Related Party Trade” product-level
17:652:40211:20:20:70:538:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection.17As discussed in
17:653:40295:20:21:70:538:524:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Antràs (2013, 2015), this data is one of the most frequently used in the analysis of the
17:654:40383:21:20:70:538:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:international make-or-buy decision. The database contains 390 manufacturing industries for
17:655:40473:20:20:70:538:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:232 countries from 2000-2011.18As a measure of vertical integration, we use U.S. intra-
17:656:40560:20:20:70:538:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm import share, defined as the ratio of related-party imports to the sum of related and
17:657:40650:20:20:70:538:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:non-related imports. A related-party import is defined as an import transaction involving
17:658:40739:20:21:70:538:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parties “with various types of relationships including any person directly or indirectly, owning,
17:659:40836:21:20:70:538:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:controlling or holding power to vote, 6 percent of the outstanding voting stock or shares of
17:660:40928:20:20:70:538:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:any organization”, whereas non-related imports involves parties that “have no affiliation with
17:661:41022:20:20:70:511:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each other”. Because this dataset covers only U.S. firms, our analysis is U.S. centered.
17:662:41110:20:21:88:538:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The second key ingredient in our analysis is a measure of cultural differences across
17:663:41195:21:20:70:538:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:countries.  We use cultural indices constructed by Geert Hofstede, initially for about 30
17:664:41284:20:20:70:538:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:countries in the early 1970s and later extended to cover more than 90 countries. Hofstede
17:665:41373:20:20:70:538:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:initially identified four key dimensions of culture: individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty
17:666:41469:20:20:70:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:avoidance, power distance (strength of social hierarchy), and masculinity-femininity (task
17:667:41559:20:21:70:538:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:orientation versus person-orientation). Since the cross-cultural psychology literature views
17:668:41651:21:20:70:538:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the individualism-collectivism cleavage as the main cultural difference across countries (see
17:669:41744:20:20:70:538:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Heine, 2008), our baseline analysis focuses on this cultural dimension, but we report results
17:670:41837:20:20:70:538:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for additional dimensions in Appendix B.19Figure 2 presents the map of individualism

17:672:42010:28:16:70:538:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:17The data is drawn from the dataset compiled and made publicly available by Pol Antràs on his homepage:

17:676:42274:8:16:70:538:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:19Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011) find that, among a variety of cultural dimensions, including the
17:677:42372:16:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:other Hofstede measures, the individualism-collectivism dimension is the most important and robustly
17:678:42472:12:0:91:306:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:significant explanatory factor of long run growth.

18:680:42608:21:20:70:539:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereI`is the individualism score of country`. We thus examine whether cultural distance
18:681:42696:20:20:70:437:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between countries affects U.S. intra-firm import shares across countries.
18:682:42769:20:20:88:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Industries in the U.S. are, however, heterogeneous in their exposure to foreign markets,
18:683:42857:20:21:70:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:organization of foreign production (i.e., integration vs. arm’s-length), and ethnic composi-
18:684:42949:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion of their managers. To enhance our identification, we construct a measure of cultural
18:685:43038:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance at the industrial level between a given country and the U.S. More specifically, we
18:686:43129:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:use information on the ancestry of U.S. citizens from the 2000 U.S. Census to estimate ethnic
18:687:43222:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:composition of managers in U.S. industries. In this census, 80.1 percent of the population
18:688:43312:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reported their ethnic origin, 72 percent of which specified a single ancestry and the remaining
18:689:43407:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:28 percent mentioned two ancestries. For the construction of our measure, we use the first
18:690:43497:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ancestry indicated by an individual. Since our theoretical model emphasizes the effect of cul-
18:691:43591:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tural distance on the managerial make-or-buy decisions, our baseline measures for cultural
18:692:43681:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:composition of a sector include only those individuals who indicated their occupation as
18:693:43769:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:‘Manager’ or ‘C.E.O’.20Having calculated the ethnic shares of managers in a given industry,
18:694:43860:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we weigh them with the individualism levels of their ancestor’s country of origin to obtain

18:702:44179:21:20:88:538:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We consider three versions of this measure to assess the robustness of our results to

18:704:44353:20:20:70:538:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:structure of trade. First, we consider only those managers who report their ancestry, and

18:711:44812:20:20:70:538:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tailored to minimize the effects of missing values and network effects within ethnic groups,
18:712:44904:20:21:70:538:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:see Rauch (1999). In particular, we construct a measure of individualism for a given trading

19:763:46842:21:20:88:538:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The inclusion of the next three control variables is motivated by the property rights The-
19:764:46932:20:20:70:538:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ory of the firm, i.e. Grossman and Hart (1986) and Antràs and Helpman (2004). According
19:765:47019:20:20:70:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to this theory, the ownership rights should be assigned to the party that conducts the most
19:766:47110:20:20:70:538:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:important relationship-specific investment.  Hence, in industries with a high headquarter
19:767:47199:20:21:70:538:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:intensity, headquarter firms are more likely to integrate their manufacturing producers and
19:768:47290:21:20:70:538:148:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to source intermediate inputs within firm boundaries (implying a high intra-firm import
19:769:47377:20:20:70:538:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:share). The empirical literature on the property rights theory of the firm has suggested the
19:770:47469:20:20:70:538:108:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:following three proxies for the headquarter intensity (see, e.g., Nunn and Trefler (2008, 2013)
19:771:47564:20:21:70:538:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Antràs (2015)):Log(R&D/Sales)is a measure of Research and Development (R&D) in-
19:772:47647:21:0:70:538:67:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tensity of an industry and is calculated as the the log of R&D expenditures divided by total
20:773:47741:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sales;Log(Capital/Labor)is a proxy for capital intensity of an industry, measured as the log
20:774:47833:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the real capital stock per worker;Log(Skilled/Unskilled)is an industry’s skill intensity,
20:775:47925:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:calculated as the log of the number of non-production workers divided by total employment.
20:776:48015:20:20:70:478:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:All three measures are available from Antràs (2015) at the 6-digit NAICS level.
20:777:48094:20:21:88:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The final two variables in our baseline specification are productivity dispersion and de-
20:778:48183:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mand elasticity in the U.S. market. The inclusion of these two control variables is motivated
20:779:48276:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the theoretical work of Antràs and Helpman (2004). In their model, a higher productivity
20:780:48367:20:20:70:538:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dispersion positively affects the share of intra-firm imports, since firms that integrate their
20:781:48462:20:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:foreign suppliers are more productive than firms that source foreign inputs at arm’s length.
20:782:48554:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Although we do not explicitly show the effect of productivity dispersion on the make-or-buy
20:783:48645:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decision in the present model, our Lemma 2 is well-aligned with this prediction. Following
20:784:48735:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Nunn and Trefler (2008, 2013) and Antràs (2015), we measure productivity dispersion as the
20:785:48825:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:standard deviation of the log of exports for a particular good across U.S. port locations and
20:786:48918:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:destination countries in 2000, using data from the U.S. department of Commerce. Similarly,
20:787:49008:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:elasticity of demand is likely to affect the revenue of firms and, thereby, the share of intra-
20:788:49103:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm imports. However, as shown by Antràs (2015), this effect is ambiguous. The measure
20:789:49190:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of U.S. demand elasticity is drawn from Antràs (2015), who adapted these data from Broda
20:790:49278:20:42:70:183:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Weinstein (2006).
20:791:49299:42:28:70:236:373:14:g_d0_f27:14:g_d0_f27:4.3  Empirical Analysis
20:792:49322:28:20:70:538:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As a first pass at the data, we plot the share of U.S. intra-firm imports aggregated at the
20:793:49413:20:20:70:538:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country level against that country’s cultural distance to the U.S. As shown in Figure 1, the
20:794:49505:20:21:70:538:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correlation between these two measures is negative and highly significant. A country such as
20:795:49597:21:20:70:538:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Pakistan, which has a high cultural distance to the U.S. has less than 10 percent of intra-firm
20:796:49692:20:20:70:538:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:imports from the U.S. whereas a country like Germany that is culturally much closer has
20:797:49779:20:20:70:306:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over 40 percent of imports that are intra-firm.
20:798:49826:20:21:88:538:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While this correlation is informative, obviously we need to control for other variables to
20:799:49916:21:20:70:538:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:see if this relation is not driven by omitted variables. Table 1 reports results for our baseline
20:800:50013:20:20:70:538:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:econometric specification. We find that as we add more controls the coefficient on cultural
20:801:50104:20:20:70:538:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance does not really change. The estimated coefficient is a robust 0.28. This means that
20:802:50196:20:20:70:538:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a standard deviation change in the level of individualism (22.13 points in the individualism
20:803:50288:20:21:70:538:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:index) is associated with a 6.4 percentage point change in the share of intra-firm imports.
20:804:50379:21:20:70:538:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This is a significant magnitude since the average share of intra-firm imports in the data base
20:805:50473:20:20:70:538:82:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we use is 19.92%. Furthermore, in accordance with Proposition 2, all three proxies for trade
20:806:50565:20:0:70:525:62:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs negatively affect the share of intra-firm trade, as can be seen in columns (2) to (5).

21:808:50734:48:20:88:538:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Estimates for the control variables in columns (3) and (4) are broadly in line with previous
21:809:50826:20:20:70:538:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:empirical studies of global sourcing, (see, e.g., Chapter 8 in Antràs (2015)).  As we see,
21:810:50916:20:21:70:538:413:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:Log(R&D/Sales)andLog(Capital/Labor)both have the predicted sign and are significant,
21:811:51000:21:20:70:538:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whileLog(Skilled/Unskilled)has the right sign but is insignificant. Importantly, comparing
21:812:51090:20:20:70:538:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fit of the statistical model in columns (4) and (5), with and without cultural distance,
21:813:51178:20:20:70:538:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suggests that cultural distance nearly doubles theR2and thus has considerable predictive
21:814:51266:20:21:70:538:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:power. This is an important result as it shows that culture is as important as property rights
21:815:51360:21:20:70:443:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:considerations in explaining outsourcing decisions of multinational firms.
21:816:51434:20:20:88:538:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While the baseline specification includes controls routinely used in global sourcing liter-
21:817:51525:20:20:70:538:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ature, one may be concerned that cultural distance can potentially pick variation of other
21:818:51615:20:21:70:538:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:factors related to culture. To address this concern, we include additional regressors that
21:819:51705:21:20:70:538:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:can simultaneously affect global sourcing and culture.  First, in order to ensure that our
21:820:51795:20:20:70:538:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:results are not confounded by common religious values, we include the share ofCatholics
21:821:51882:20:20:70:538:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:andProtestantsin the population, taken from Barro (2003). Second, one could think that
21:822:51968:20:20:70:538:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultural proximity merely picks up the effect of a common language. Hence, we include a
21:823:52055:20:21:70:538:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dummy variable equal to one ifEnglishis an official language of a partner country. This
21:824:52142:21:20:70:538:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variable is drawn from Mayer and Zignago (2011). Third, the structure of trade and cultural
21:825:52233:20:20:70:538:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attributes may be associated with the level of economic development. For example, more
21:826:52319:20:20:70:538:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:developed trading partners may happen to have a closer proximity to the U.S. in terms of

22:854:53549:21:20:70:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We should note that while it has been shown that the level of income can affect the volume
22:855:53639:20:20:70:538:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of trade between countries, we are not aware of models or empirical evidence linking the level
22:856:53733:20:20:70:538:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of income to the structure of global sourcing. Fourth, Guiso et al. (2006) suggest that the
22:857:53824:20:20:70:538:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:level of trust can influence the volume of trade between countries. It is, however, not clear
22:858:53917:20:21:70:538:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:how differences in the level of trust between countries affect a firm’s international make-or-
22:859:54011:21:20:70:539:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:buy decision. To tackle this question, we also control for the country’s level ofTrust, drawn
22:860:54104:20:20:70:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the World Values Survey. Finally, the correlation between make-or-buy relationship
22:861:54191:20:20:70:538:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and culture may be driven by the volatility of the institutional environment. For example,
22:862:54281:20:21:70:538:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:poor and volatile institutions may be associated to a higher level of collectivism (e.g., it may
22:863:54377:21:20:70:538:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be easier to survive as a group) and increased integration (e.g., it may be easier to avoid
22:864:54468:20:20:70:538:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:hold-up problems). To measure the stability of institutions, we use the ICRG’sGovernment
22:865:54556:20:20:70:335:195:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f3:Stabilityscore averaged over 1980s through 2000s.21
22:866:54607:20:20:88:538:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We find that including these additional controls does not alter our conclusions about the
22:867:54696:20:21:70:538:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strength of the relationship between cultural distance and the structure of global sourcing,
22:868:54788:21:26:70:538:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as can be seen from Table 2. The estimated coefficients on these additional variables may

22:871:55081:12:12:91:538:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents, each with a maximum score of four points and
22:872:55181:12:12:91:538:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:a minimum score of 0 points. A score of 4 points means Very Low Risk and a score of 0 points means
22:873:55279:12:0:91:448:56:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:a Very High Risk. The maximum score, based on the three subcomponents, is 12.
23:874:55358:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be interesting in their own right. For example, the U.S. multinationals are more likely to
23:875:55448:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:integrate their foreign affiliates in countries with a great share of Catholics and Protestants,
23:876:55544:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:having an official language other than English, a higher level of income, and more stable
23:877:55633:20:20:70:137:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:governments.
23:878:55645:20:21:88:538:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While including more regressors mitigates the omitted variables bias, we can make further
23:879:55734:21:20:70:538:657:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:steps to sharpen our conclusions.  Specifically, we consider two additional identification
23:880:55824:20:20:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:strategies. First, we apply an instrumental variables approach. Second, we use variation of
23:881:55915:20:20:70:288:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ethnic compositions across U.S. industries.
23:882:55958:20:20:88:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To implement the first strategy, we follow Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011) who use
23:883:56040:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differences in the frequency of blood types across ethnic groups to quantify genetic distance
23:884:56133:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between countries. Since blood type is a neutral genetic marker determined many centuries
23:885:56222:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:before the industrial revolution, this genetic marker is unlikely to have a direct effect on
23:886:56314:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economic outcomes.  Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011) document that blood distance is
23:887:56397:20:21:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a strong predictor of cultural differences.  Column (6) in Table 2 shows that using this
23:888:56485:21:20:70:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:IV reduces the size of the estimate (from -0.211 to -0.105) and, while the magnitude is
23:889:56572:20:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economically significant, the estimated coefficient is not statistically different from zero.
23:890:56665:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This reduction in the size of the coefficient is largely due to Mexico that has a very high
23:891:56756:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:intra-firm import share (because of NAFTA) but is culturally quite different (see figure 1).
23:892:56848:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Once we exclude Mexico from the regression (column 7), the IV estimate of cultural distance
23:893:56939:21:20:70:252:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:becomes significant at the 5% level.
23:894:56975:20:20:88:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While these results are reassuring, they do not eliminate the possibility that there are
23:895:57063:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:confounding factors that vary at the level of the country. The standard practice is to in-
23:896:57153:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:clude country fixed effects to address this issue. Unfortunately, we cannot implement this
23:897:57243:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:approach in the baseline specification because our cultural distance between countries does
23:898:57334:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not vary across industries. However, as we discussed above, there is considerable variation
23:899:57425:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the ethnic composition of management across U.S. industries.  We can thus construct
23:900:57511:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:country/industry-specific measures of cultural distance and use country and year fixed ef-
23:901:57601:20:21:70:538:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fects to attenuate the adverse effects of these confounding factors.  This constitutes our
23:902:57691:21:20:70:151:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second strategy.
23:903:57707:20:20:88:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Columns (1) through (3) in Table 3 show that using these alternative measures of cultural
23:904:57796:20:20:70:538:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distance yields results similar to the baseline where we do not include country or year fixed
23:905:57889:20:21:70:538:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effects. The coefficient is in general higher than with the country cultural distance. This is
23:906:57983:21:20:70:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:good news, because it tends to suggest that the cultural distance effect between managers
23:907:58072:20:20:70:538:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is even larger than the estimate obtained when using country cultural distance. Note that

24:949:60550:21:20:70:538:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we control for the country and year fixed effects, we continue to find a strong negative
24:950:60638:20:20:70:538:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:association between cultural distance and intra-firm import share.22The magnitude of the
24:951:60726:20:20:70:538:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimate is somewhat smaller but this reduction in magnitude may simply reflect a decrease
24:952:60816:20:21:70:538:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the signal-to-noise ratio in a regression with many fixed effects (see Griliches and Hausman
24:953:60911:21:20:70:538:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1986). The coefficient onCulturaldistance(2)remains negative but loses its significance. The
24:954:61003:20:20:70:538:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lack of significance is not surprising given that this measure assigns the U.S. individualism

25:989:62716:36:20:88:538:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the last robustness check, we repeat our exercise using a slightly modified measure of
25:990:62805:20:20:70:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultural distance. More specifically, we expand our definition of cultural distance to include
25:991:62899:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the other three Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty
25:992:62991:20:21:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:avoidance.  Power distance measures the extent to which the less powerful members of
25:993:63075:21:20:70:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:organizations and institutions (in society and the family) accept and expect that power
25:994:63162:20:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is distributed unequally. Masculinity refers to the dominance of men over women and to
25:995:63248:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the dominance of “male” values such as assertiveness and competitiveness versus norms of
25:996:63336:20:21:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:caring and modesty.  Uncertainty aversion measures a society’s tolerance for uncertainty
25:997:63424:21:20:70:538:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and the extent to which members of society feel either uncomfortable or comfortable in
25:998:63510:20:20:70:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:situations that are novel, unknown, surprising, different from usual. Uncertainty avoiding
25:999:63600:20:20:70:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultures try to minimize the possibility of such situations by strict laws and rules, safety and
25:1000:63696:20:20:70:538:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:security measures. They are less tolerant and reject forms of diversity within society. The
25:1001:63787:20:21:70:538:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cultural distance measures we use are the sum of the absolute differences of the four different
25:1002:63882:21:20:70:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indicators in the country of origin of the imports and the constructed index in the U.S. sector
25:1003:63977:20:20:70:538:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:based on ethnic shared derived from the census. We rerun our original regressions using
25:1004:64064:20:0:70:538:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these measures and report the associated coefficients in Tables 4, 5, and 6 in Appendix B.
26:1005:64156:0:21:70:538:759:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As before, the negative effect of cultural distance on the intra-firm import share is significant
26:1006:64253:21:20:70:538:738:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and robust to various specifications. Yet, the magnitude of the effect is generally slightly
26:1007:64345:20:20:70:538:718:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lower than in the original regressions using only the individualism-collectivism dimension.
26:1008:64436:20:20:70:538:698:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This confirms our original conjecture that the individualism-collectivism dimension is the
26:1009:64526:20:49:70:316:678:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:main cultural distance variable across countries.
26:1010:64575:49:32:70:187:629:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:5  Conclusion
26:1011:64588:32:20:70:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We presented an incomplete contract model of global sourcing with culturally dissimilar
26:1012:64675:20:21:70:538:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:countries. In this model, headquarter managers decide whether to source intermediate inputs
26:1013:64766:21:20:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from independent suppliers or integrate the latter into firm boundaries against the backdrop
26:1014:64858:20:20:70:538:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of private costs associated with cross-cultural collaboration. The key prediction of our model
26:1015:64952:20:20:70:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is that greater cultural distance will reduce the headquarters’ incentive to source inputs from
26:1016:65047:20:20:70:538:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:an integrated supplier. Using an extensive dataset on U.S. firms’ related-party imports and
26:1017:65138:20:21:70:538:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the well-known cultural dimensions by Hofstede, we find a strong empirical support for our
26:1018:65228:21:20:70:538:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:key prediction, controlling for a great range of additional variables and accounting for the
26:1019:65320:20:20:70:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:issue of endogeneity. Although we cannot rule out that cultural motives for the international
26:1020:65413:20:20:70:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:make-or-buy decision may also work via other channels than the ones suggested in our
26:1021:65497:20:21:70:538:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model, our empirical results show that cultural motives can shed new light on patterns of
26:1022:65586:21:20:70:332:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:international trade and organization of production.
26:1023:65637:20:20:88:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our theoretical framework leaves open several questions for future research. First, cul-
26:1024:65725:20:20:70:538:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tural dimensions in the current version of model affect solely managerial job satisfaction.
26:1025:65816:20:20:70:538:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While we believe that our results will continue to hold if we allow for workers’ job satis-
26:1026:65907:20:21:70:538:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:faction, a study of organizational structure and international team-work in a multi-cultural
26:1027:65999:21:20:70:538:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:environment might be an appealing research agenda in itself. Second, we abstracted from
26:1028:66086:20:20:70:538:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the canonical property rights approach by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore
26:1029:66171:20:20:70:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1900). Our empirical work, however, suggests that both theories may simultaneously explain
