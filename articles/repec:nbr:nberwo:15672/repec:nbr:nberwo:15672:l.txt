2:25:1005:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:Despite the concern that student plagiarism has become increasingly common, there is relatively little
2:26:1107:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:objective data on the prevalence or determinants of this illicit behavior. This study presents the results
2:27:1213:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:of a natural field experiment designed to address these questions. Over 1,200 papers were collected
2:28:1312:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:from the students in undergraduate courses at a selective post-secondary institution. Students in half
2:29:1414:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:of the participating courses were randomly assigned to a requirement that they complete an anti-plagiarism
2:30:1520:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:tutorial before submitting their papers. We found that assignment to the treatment group substantially
2:31:1622:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:reduced the likelihood of plagiarism, particularly among student with lower SAT scores who had the
2:32:1720:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:highest rates of plagiarism. A follow-up survey of participating students suggests that the intervention
2:33:1824:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:reduced plagiarism by increasing student knowledge rather than by increasing the perceived probabilities
2:34:1928:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:of detection and punishment. These results are consistent with a model of student behavior in which
2:35:2027:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:?:the decision to plagiarize reflects both a poor understanding of academic integrity and the perception
2:36:2129:14:42:72:385:434:12:Times:12:Times:?:that the probabilities of detection and severe punishment are low.

3:50:2437:0:20:90:170:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:1. Introduction 
3:51:2453:20:21:126:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Several  high-profile  scandals  involving  plagiarism by  prominent  writers  have 
3:52:2537:21:20:90:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:recently   captured   the   public's   attention   (McGrath   2007).   Similarly,   the   dramatic 
3:53:2636:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:technological  progress  of  the  last  two  decades  (e.g.,  the  widespread  availability  of  full-
3:54:2738:21:21:90:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:text  resources  and  “cut  and  paste”  word  processing)  has  fueled  the  impression  that  this 
3:55:2839:21:21:90:525:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:illicit  behavior  has  become  both  substantially  easier  and  more  common  among  students 
3:56:2935:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(e.g.,  Rimer  2003).  Posner  (2007)  has  recently  argued  for  a  nuanced  understanding  of 
3:57:3032:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism  in  which  the  gravity  of  an  offense  (and,  correspondingly,  the  appropriate 
3:58:3128:21:21:90:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:policy response) depends on the extent to which the misrepresentation imposes negative 
3:59:3215:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:externalities  (i.e.,  a  "detrimental  reliance").  By this  criterion,  plagiarism  committed  by 
3:60:3315:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students is a particularly serious offense. Students who plagiarize without punishment are 
3:61:3406:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:likely  to  benefit  at  the  expense  of  their  peers  with  respect  to  valued  outcomes  such  as 
3:62:3509:21:20:90:243:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:grades and recommendations.1  
3:63:3539:20:21:125:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Unsurprisingly,  plagiarism  is  strongly  proscribed  in  the  guidelines  of  most  post-
3:64:3630:21:21:89:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:secondary institutions. However, when used in isolation, these stern institutional statutes 
3:65:3722:21:21:89:524:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:may be misaligned with the behavioral context that influences the decision to plagiarize. 
3:66:3812:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Student plagiarism is a fairly unique type of illicit behavior in that it may often reflect a 
3:67:3906:20:21:89:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:type of "rational ignorance."2 The available evidence suggests that college students do not 
3:68:3998:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have a clear understanding of what constitutes plagiarism and how it can be avoided (e.g., 
3:69:4089:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Power  2009,  Howard  and  Davies  2009).  Furthermore,  the  incentives  for  students  to 
3:70:4181:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:educate  themselves  about  plagiarism  may  be  fairly  weak  given  that  college  instructors 
3:71:4278:21:21:90:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tend  to  put  little  effort  into  detection  and  to  prosecute  cases  of  detected  plagiarism 
3:72:4378:21:64:90:506:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:informally and lightly (e.g., Schneider 1999, McCabe, Treviño, and Butterfield 2001). 
3:73:4464:64:7:233:236:189:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
3:74:4512:7:16:90:524:182:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:1  As  a  counterexample  of  plagiarism  that  is  less  problematic,  Posner  (2007)  outlines  how  Shakespeare's 
3:75:4629:16:11:90:523:166:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:Antony  and  Cleopatra  borrows  liberally  but  elegantly  from  Sir  Thomas  North's  translation  of  Plutarch. 
3:76:4744:11:12:90:521:155:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:Posner (2007) suggests that such borrowing is a pedigreed form of creativity that does not create material 
3:77:4851:12:7:90:358:143:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:harm, concluding "if this is plagiarism, we need more plagiarism." 
3:78:4918:7:16:90:521:136:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:2  Downs  (1957)  seminal  public-choice  research  popularized  the  term  "rational  ignorance"  in  reference  to 
3:79:5034:16:12:90:524:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:voters  who  choose  to  obtain  low  levels  of  civic  knowledge  because  of  the  non-trivial  costs  of  gaining 
3:80:5152:12:11:90:521:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:knowledge and the vanishingly small likelihood that their vote would actually be instrumental in decision-
3:81:5258:11:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:making.  Ironically  in  the  context  of  this  study,  Mueller  (1989,  page  205)  notes  that  this  idea  was  also 
3:82:5379:11:12:90:522:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:present  in  the  earlier  writings  on  democracy  by  Joseph  Schumpeter.  An  alternative  example  of  an  illicit 
3:83:5498:12:0:90:444:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:behavior that may reflect an endogenously determined level of ignorance is tax evasion. 
4:84:5588:0:21:125:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Despite the growing concerns about plagiarism in higher education, there is little 
4:85:5671:21:21:89:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:objectively measured descriptive evidence on its prevalence and character.3 Furthermore, 
4:86:5760:21:20:90:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:policy interventions designed to understand and reduce the prevalence of plagiarism have 
4:87:5849:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:not  been  rigorously  evaluated.  This  study  presents the  results  of  a  “natural  field 
4:88:5943:21:21:90:514:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:experiment” (Harrison and List 2004) designed to provide evidence on these questions.  
4:89:6030:21:21:126:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:More  specifically,  we  conducted  a  group-randomized trial  in  undergraduate 
4:90:6111:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:social-science  and  humanities  classes  at  a  single, selective  post-secondary  institution 
4:91:6207:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:during the fall 2007 semester. Each of the participating classes had a Blackboard web site 
4:92:6298:21:21:90:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  provided  students  with  access  to  course  materials.  All  of  the  students  in  the 
4:93:6394:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:participating courses (i.e., 573 students who wrote a total of 1,256 papers) were unaware 
4:94:6484:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  they  were  participating  in  a  research  study  but  were  required  by  their  instructors  to 
4:95:6589:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:submit  their  writing  assignments  electronically  through  these  Blackboard-based  course 
4:96:6683:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:web  sites.  We  paired  the  28  participating  courses  on  baseline  traits  (e.g.,  the  same 
4:97:6781:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructor) and randomly assigned courses within these pairs (i.e., "block randomization") 
4:98:6872:21:21:90:524:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to treatment and control conditions. The classroom-level treatment consisted of requiring 
4:99:6962:21:21:90:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students  to  complete  a  short  but  detailed  and  interactive  Blackboard-based  tutorial  on 
4:100:7060:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:understanding   and   avoiding   plagiarism.   Students   in the   treatment   courses   were 
4:101:7154:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:encouraged  to  complete  the  treatment  early  in  the  semester  but  were required  to  do  so 
4:102:7253:21:21:90:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:before  they  were  allowed  to  upload  their  writing  assignments.  We  collected  searchable, 
4:103:7351:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:electronic  files  of  the  papers  from  all  of  the  participating  courses  and  analyzed  these 
4:104:7452:20:21:90:452:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:papers using proprietary plagiarism-detection software (i.e., Turnitin.com). 
4:105:7529:21:21:125:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our  results  indicate  that  plagiarism  occurred  in  3.3  percent  of  the  papers  from 
4:106:7621:21:20:89:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:courses  randomly  assigned  to  the  control  condition.  The  type  of  plagiarism  in  these 
4:107:7717:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:papers  was  almost  exclusively  of  the  "mosaic"  variety  (i.e.,  using  sentences  or  sentence 
4:108:7818:21:21:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:clauses  without  attribution).  While  the  overall  prevalence  of  plagiarism  was  low,  we 
4:109:7914:21:21:89:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:found that it was largely concentrated among males and students with lower SAT scores. 
4:110:8001:21:26:89:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The pattern with regard to SAT scores suggests that plagiarism may be substantially more

4:112:8138:8:16:90:522:136:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:3 Some evidence suggests that student plagiarism is quite common. For example, in a recent survey fielded 
4:113:8244:16:12:90:521:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:to over 60,000 students at 83 different campuses in the United States and Canada, over a third of students 
4:114:8351:12:11:90:522:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:admitted  to  paraphrasing  or  copying  a  few  sentences  from  a  print  or  Internet  source  without  attribution, 
4:115:8471:11:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:sometime  in  the  past  year  (McCabe  2005).  However,  the  reliability  of  much  of  this  evidence  has  been 
4:116:8587:11:12:90:522:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:questioned  because  it  is  based  on  student  self-reports  of  a  behavior  which  they  may  not  understand  well 
4:117:8707:12:0:90:256:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:(Brown and Emmett 2001, Power 2009). 
5:118:8746:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:common  among  the  typical  college  student.  Based  on our  data,  one  would  predict  a 
5:119:8839:21:21:90:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism rate of 17.7 percent among students at the national mean of SAT scores (i.e., 
5:120:8928:21:20:90:524:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1017)  and  31.4  percent  among  students  at  the  25th  percentile  of  SAT  scores  (i.e.,  850).  
5:121:9031:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:These  figures  are   roughly  consistent  with  prior  self-reports  on  the   prevalence  of 
5:122:9126:21:21:90:150:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism.  
5:123:9139:21:21:126:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:We  find  that  random  assignment  to  the  web  tutorial reduced  instances  of 
5:124:9221:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism  by  roughly  2  percentage  points  overall  (i.e.,  a  two-thirds  reduction)  and  that 
5:125:9323:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  treatment  effect  was  concentrated  among  students  with  lower  SAT  scores.  The 
5:126:9415:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:results of an ex-post survey and quiz completed by participating students suggest that the 
5:127:9506:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment  was  effective  in  large  part  because  it  increased  student  awareness  about  what 
5:128:9606:20:21:90:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:constitutes  plagiarism  and  knowledge  of  effective  writing  strategies.    We  find  much 
5:129:9701:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:weaker evidence that the intervention altered student perceptions about the likelihood of 
5:130:9791:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:detection  and/or  sanctions  associated  with  detection.  Our  results  indicate  that  an  easily 
5:131:9892:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:replicable, scalable, and virtually costless educational intervention can be highly effective 
5:132:9986:21:21:90:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:at reducing the prevalence of student plagiarism. Furthermore, because the treatment was 
5:133:10075:21:21:90:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:particularly effective among students with lower SAT scores, these inferences may have 
5:134:10162:21:20:90:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:good  external  validity  for  post-secondary  institutions  that  are  less  selective  than  the

5:145:10778:20:21:90:229:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:2.1 Prevalence and Trends 
5:146:10804:21:21:126:521:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Plagiarism  by  students  is  widely  thought  to  be  common,  particularly  with  the 
5:147:10892:21:20:90:521:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:diffusion  of  Internet  access  to  full-text  resources  and  word-processing  software  (Rimer 
5:148:10990:20:0:90:521:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:2003).  Consistent  with  this  view,  a  recent  study  by  Baruchson-Arbib  and  Yaari  (2004) 
6:149:11089:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:found  that  undergraduates  are  less  likely  to  view  plagiarism  from  resources  that  are 
6:150:11186:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:available  on-line  as  a  form  of  academic  dishonesty.  However,  the  available  data  on 
6:151:11281:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism,  which  is  based  largely  on  student  self-reports  from  surveys  with  distinctive 
6:152:11381:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:design  features,  do  not  appear  to  provide  clear  evidence  on  the  prevalence  or  trend  in 
6:153:11482:21:21:90:184:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:student plagiarism. 
6:154:11502:21:21:126:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:An  influential  early  survey  of  students  from  99  colleges  and  universities  during 
6:155:11594:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  spring  of  1963  (Bowers  1964)  found  that  28  percent  of  students  indicated  that  they 
6:156:11695:20:21:90:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:had plagiarized from published materials at least once since entering college. More recent 
6:157:11786:21:21:90:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:surveys  of  college  students  suggest  both  higher  and  lower  levels  of  plagiarism  (e.g., 
6:158:11884:21:20:90:444:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:McCabe and Treviño 1997, Scanlon and Neumann 2002, McCabe 2005). 
6:159:11949:20:21:126:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:A number of factors complicate any comparisons of the extant survey data. One is 
6:160:12030:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  the  available  data  are  not  based  on  a  consistently  defined  sampling  frame  of  post-
6:161:12131:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:secondary institutions and often have quite low response rates. Differences in the design 
6:162:12221:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the salient survey questions are another complicating factor (e.g., misconduct defined 
6:163:12311:21:21:90:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:since  entering  college  or  over  the  past  year).  The conflicting  data  on  the  prevalence  of 
6:164:12413:21:21:90:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:academic  misconduct  may  also  reflect  other  survey  artifacts.  For  example,  Brown  and 
6:165:12508:21:20:90:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Emmett (2001) examined data from multiple studies of student dishonesty and found that 
6:166:12595:20:21:90:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  number  of  student  practices  included  in  the  study  was  related  to  the  overall  level  of 
6:167:12700:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:student cheating. Another more subtle complication suggested by McCabe, Treviño, and 
6:168:12785:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Butterfield  (2001,  page  221)  is  that  comparisons  of  self-reports  by  students  may 
6:169:12877:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:understate  the  growth  in  plagiarism  because  of  shifting  norms  about  what  actually 
6:170:12970:21:21:90:324:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:constitutes an inappropriate use of source texts.  
6:171:13021:21:20:126:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:These  concerns  about  the  subjectivity  of  self  reports  and  low  response  rates 
6:172:13109:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:underscore  the  usefulness  of  this  study's  data,  which  are  based  on  objective  analyses  of 
6:173:13211:21:21:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the papers submitted by the universe of students in the participating courses. At least two 
6:174:13303:21:21:89:525:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:other studies have provided similar evidence on the prevalence of plagiarism, though on a 
6:175:13393:21:20:89:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:smaller  scale.  Lau  et  al.  (2005)  collected  the  two papers  written  by  328  students  in  two 
6:176:13496:20:21:89:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sections of a psychology class and analyzed them using the plagiarism-detection service, 
6:177:13585:21:21:89:521:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Turnitin.com. This software generates a "similarity score", which indicates how much of 
6:178:13673:21:0:89:522:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:a  paper's  text  matches  the  text  catalogued  in  their  databases.  They  found  that  over  20 
7:179:13776:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent of papers had similarity scores above two percent.4 Bilic-Zulle, Azman, Frkovic, 
7:180:13865:21:21:89:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and  Petrovecki  (2008)  used  different  plagiarism-detection  software  (WCopyfind)  to 
7:181:13955:21:20:89:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:identify  the  pre-intervention  prevalence  of  plagiarism  among  111  medical  students  in 
7:182:14050:20:21:89:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Croatia during 2000 and 2001. The writing assignment in question was based on known 
7:183:14134:21:21:89:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:source  articles  and  the  software  flagged  text  as  plagiarized  if  six  or  more  consecutive 
7:184:14235:21:21:89:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:words matched the source text. Their baseline results indicated a considerable amount of 
7:185:14324:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism:  66  percent  of  student  papers  had  a  matched-text  rate  that  exceeded  10 
7:186:14418:20:21:89:130:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent.

7:189:14470:20:21:125:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  extant  literature  also  suggests  that  a  number  of  individual  and  contextual 
7:190:14560:21:21:89:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:traits  exert  an  important  influence  on  the  likelihood  of  committing  plagiarism.  For 
7:191:14655:21:20:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:example,  studies  based  on  student  self-reports  generally  indicate  that  younger  students, 
7:192:14754:20:21:89:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:males,  those  engaged  in  more  extracurricular  activities  and  those  with  weaker  academic 
7:193:14852:21:21:89:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:performance  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  academic  misconduct  (e.g.,  McCabe  and 
7:194:14942:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Treviño   1997,   Genereux   and   McLeod   1995).   Several   studies   also   examine   the 
7:195:15036:21:20:89:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:relationship between psychological traits and academic misconduct. For example, Lau et 
7:196:15123:20:21:89:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:al. (2005) find that a measure of psychopathy along with low verbal ability were strongly 
7:197:15213:21:21:89:327:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:predictive of an objective measure of plagiarism. 
7:198:15263:21:20:125:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In   a   recent   synthesis   of   the   broader   psychological literature   on   academic 
7:199:15355:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:misconduct,  Murdock  and  Anderman  (2006)  emphasize  the  role  of  three  motivational 
7:200:15446:21:21:90:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:mechanisms.  First,  students  whose  academic  motivation  is  extrinsic  rather  than  intrinsic 
7:201:15545:21:20:90:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are  more  likely  to  cheat.  Second,  students  are  more  likely  to  cheat  when  they  have  low 
7:202:15647:20:21:90:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:expectations  of  their  capacity  to  reach  their  academic  goals  through  personal  effort. 
7:203:15744:21:21:90:522:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Third,  students  who  view  the  potential  costs  of  cheating  as  minimal  are  more  likely  to 
7:204:15845:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cheat.  Posner  (2007,  page  89)  also  stressed  the  role  of  self-interest  noting  that  students 
7:205:15949:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:"plagiarize  to  save  time,  to  get  better  grades,  or both;  the  effect  on  learning  and 
7:206:16046:20:30:90:442:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:evaluation is significant and punishment often and appropriately severe." 
7:207:16120:30:7:233:236:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
7:208:16168:7:16:90:521:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:4 This may actually overstate the true prevalence of plagiarism. We use Turnitin.com to detect plagiarism in 
7:209:16277:16:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:our study as  well. However,  our review of the similarity  scores indicated that they contained a significant 
7:210:16388:11:12:90:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:number  of  false  positives.  Therefore,  we  relied  on multiple-rater  review  of  the  underlying  "originality 
7:211:16504:12:0:90:352:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:reports" to identify unambiguous instances of student plagiarism. 
8:212:16572:0:21:125:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:A  review  article  by  McCabe,  Treviño,  and  Butterfield  (2001)  underscored  the 
8:213:16658:21:21:89:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:empirical  relevance  of  related  but  broader  contextual  factors  such  as  the  perception  of 
8:214:16758:21:20:89:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cheating  by  peers  and  the  perceived  severity  of  penalties.  The  literature  on  the  apparent 
8:215:16861:20:21:89:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:relevance  of  contextual  factors  lends  credence  to  the  consensus  view  that  "cheating  can 
8:216:16961:21:21:89:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:be   most   effectively   addressed   at   the   institutional level"   (McCabe,   Treviño,   and 
8:217:17059:21:21:89:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Butterfield  2001).  Another  complicating  factor  that  supports  this  view  is  the  somewhat 
8:218:17157:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indifferent role that may be played by faculty. College instructors do not generally view

8:225:17620:20:21:125:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:There  is  relatively  little  research  that  evaluates specific  policies  or  interventions 
8:226:17715:21:21:89:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:designed  to  reduce  student  plagiarism.    One  prominent  institutional  policy  that  has 
8:227:17810:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:received some attention is an honor code. Basic cross-sectional comparisons suggest that 
8:228:17899:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:honor  codes  are  fairly  effective.  For  example,  McCabe,  Treviño,  and  Butterfield  (2001) 
8:229:17997:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:report  that,  in  a  study  of  students  at  31  selective  colleges  and  universities  during  the 
8:230:18100:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1995-96  academic  year  43  percent  of  students  at  institutions  without  honor  codes 
8:231:18192:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:admitted to copying a sentence or two without attribution while at institutions with honor 
8:232:18283:20:21:89:342:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:codes the corresponding prevalence was 32 percent. 
8:233:18334:21:21:125:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Three  other  small-scale  studies  provide  similarly  encouraging  evidence  on  the 
8:234:18421:21:20:89:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:potential  efficacy  of  targeted  classroom  and  institutional  policies.  Bilic-Zulle,  Azman, 
8:235:18519:20:21:89:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Frkovic, and Petrovecki (2008) compared the plagiarism rates among different cohorts of 
8:236:18607:21:21:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Croatian medical students and found that it dropped dramatically (i.e., from 66 percent to 
8:237:18698:21:21:89:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:11  percent)  after  the  introduction  of  warnings  about  the  penalties  for  plagiarism  and 
8:238:18796:21:20:89:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:making it known that plagiarism-detection software would be used. Second, a similar pre-
8:239:18884:20:21:89:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:post  comparison  based  on  a  sample  of  students  at  San  Diego  State  University  suggests 
8:240:18982:21:21:89:521:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that completing a web tutorial raised student performance on a plagiarism quiz from 85.6 
8:241:19071:21:20:89:522:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent  to  91.6  percent  (Jackson  2006).  Third,  a  lab-experimental  study  provides 
8:242:19162:20:0:89:522:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:evidence  consistent  with  the  evidence  from  cross-sectional  and  time-series  comparisons 
9:243:19260:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:about  the  importance  of  contextual  factors.  Specifically,  in  a  lab  study  based  on 
9:244:19354:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:psychology  students  at  a  university  in  the  United  States,  Rettinger  and  Kramer  (2009) 
9:245:19452:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:experimentally  manipulated  student  exposure  to  vignettes  about  peer  attitudes  and 
9:246:19543:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:behavior regarding academic misconduct and found that this manipulation influenced the 
9:247:19630:21:21:90:450:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:stated likelihood that they or a protagonist would engage in such behavior. 
9:248:19706:21:21:126:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:However,  the  extant  literature  has  a  number  of  important  shortcomings  that  the 
9:249:19796:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:design  of  this  study  addresses  directly.  First,  this  study  provides  evidence  on  the 
9:250:19892:20:21:90:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:prevalence  and  characteristics  of  student  plagiarism  using  objective  measures  from  a 
9:251:19987:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:large  number  of  actual  student  papers  rather  than  potentially  unreliable  student  self-
9:252:20084:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:reports. Second, this study provides evidence on the efficacy of a web-based tutorial that 
9:253:20175:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:seeks  to  educate  students  about  what  constitutes  plagiarism  and  effective  research  and 
9:254:20273:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:writing  strategies  for  avoiding  it.  This  is  a  distinctive  approach  in  that  it  does  not  rely 
9:255:20380:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:directly  on  the  perceived  threats  of  detection  but rather  on  enhancing  human  capital. 
9:256:20477:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Given  the  stylized  evidence  that  students  with  low measures  of  prior  achievement  are 
9:257:20573:21:21:90:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more  likely  to  engage  in  academic  misconduct,  this may  be  a  particularly  effective 
9:258:20667:21:21:90:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:margin on which to improve student outcomes. Similarly, policy recommendations often 
9:259:20752:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:underscore  the  need  for  a  "hidden  curriculum"  that informs  students  about  academic 
9:260:20845:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ethics (e.g., McCabe, Treviño, and Butterfield 2001). The tutorial evaluated in this study 
9:261:20936:21:21:90:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is one quite explicit way to operationalize such a curriculum. Furthermore, the format of 
9:262:21026:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  tutorial  is  such  that  it  could  be  replicated  and  scaled  up  in  different  institutions  at 
9:263:21134:20:21:90:140:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:little cost. 
9:264:21147:21:21:126:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Third  and  perhaps  most  important,  by  utilizing  random  assignment  in  a  field 
9:265:21234:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:setting,  the  evaluation  evidence  presented  here  is credibly  robust  to  concerns  about 
9:266:21329:20:21:90:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:internal  validity.  The  available  inferences  based  on  cross-institutional  comparisons  of 
9:267:21426:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:student  surveys  could  be  seriously  confounded  by  non-random  student  selection  into 
9:268:21519:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:schools  with  particular  traits  as  well  as  by  omitted  variables.  However,  the  random 
9:269:21615:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assignment   procedures   in   this   study   should   balance the   potentially   confounding 
9:270:21710:20:21:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:unobservables  across  the  treatment  and  control  conditions  and  allow  the  effect  of  the

10:277:22061:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:versions   of   anonymized   student   papers   from   28   undergraduate   social-science   and 
10:278:22158:21:21:90:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:humanities  courses  during  the  fall  2007  semester.  The  collection  of  student  papers 
10:279:22252:21:21:90:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:occurred  largely  through  the  Blackboard  classroom-management  web  page  for  each 
10:280:22340:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:course and the participating students were unaware of the study's existence. As part of the

10:282:22530:21:21:90:419:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:institution and all student papers were anonymized prior to analysis.

10:285:22640:20:21:126:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:We  began  the  recruitment  of  courses  by  identifying all  the  social-science  and 
10:286:22728:21:20:89:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:humanities  courses  offered  during  the  Fall  2007  semester.  We  excluded  quantitative-
10:287:22821:20:21:89:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:methods  courses,  small-scale  seminars,  and  research  colloquia  as  well  as  independent

10:289:23016:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:comparatively large enrollments and solicited their participation in a campus-wide study 
10:290:23105:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on student writing. The motivation for our emphasis on larger classes (i.e., typically 18 or 
10:291:23198:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more students) was both increased statistical power for our research effort and a potential 
10:292:23290:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:increase  in  the  external  validity  of  our  inferences  for  institutions  that,  on  average,  have 
10:293:23395:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:larger   class   sizes   than   the   participating   institution.   To   complement   the   block-
10:294:23494:20:21:89:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:randomization  strategy  we  describe  below,  we  also  recruited  courses  with  somewhat 
10:295:23586:21:21:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:smaller  enrollments  in  situations  where  those  courses  were  taught  by  the  instructor  of 
10:296:23685:21:20:89:211:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:another recruited course. 
10:297:23711:20:21:125:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The instructors were asked whether they would be willing to include their course 
10:298:23792:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in an IRB-approved, field-research project on the characteristics of student writing. They 
10:299:23883:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:were  told  that  participation  would  not  involve  any substantive  change  in  their  course. 
10:300:23981:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Participation  would  simply  require  using  Blackboard's  classroom-management  software 
10:301:24072:20:21:90:522:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to collect student papers electronically and to provide students with information on their 
10:302:24163:21:21:90:522:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:writing assignments. To encourage participation, the research team made it clear that they 
10:303:24254:21:20:90:522:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:would  design  and  manage  this  aspect  of  Blackboard  as  well  as  provide  participating 
10:304:24349:20:0:90:521:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructors with printed or electronic versions of all their submitted writing assignments. 
11:305:24443:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The  instructors  for  9  of  the  46  recruited  courses  provided  no  responses  to  recruitment 
11:306:24543:21:21:90:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:queries.  Four  other  courses  had  no  valid  writing  assignment.  The  instructors  for  5

11:309:24762:21:21:90:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:conditions.  Courses  in  the  control  state  merely  had  students  use  Blackboard  to  submit 
11:310:24860:21:21:90:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:their  writing  assignments.  In  courses  assigned  to  the  treatment  state,  students  also 
11:311:24956:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:submitted  their  writing  assignments  through  Blackboard.  However,  before  they  were 
11:312:25047:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:allowed  to  do  so,  they  also  had  to  complete  a  Blackboard-based  tutorial  and  quiz  on 
11:313:25145:21:21:90:397:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism. This intervention is described in more detail below. 
11:314:25210:21:20:126:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our   course-based   randomization   avoids   the   contamination   that   might   have

11:316:25389:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment.  However,  a  potential  drawback  of  randomizing  over  only  28  units  is  that  the 
11:317:25489:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment  and  control  courses  might  not  be  balanced  with  regard  to  observed  and,  more 
11:318:25588:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:important,  unobserved  baseline  traits.  To  reduce  this  possibility,  we  employed  a  simple 
11:319:25687:21:21:90:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:block  randomization  strategy,  pairing  participating  courses  on  baseline  traits  and  then 
11:320:25785:21:21:90:245:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:randomizing within those pairs.

11:322:25910:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:with  a  similar  propensity  for  student  plagiarism  by  using  baseline  traits  that  are  highly 
11:323:26013:21:21:90:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:predictive  of  the  prevalence  of  plagiarism.  Unfortunately,  reliable  baseline  variables  of 
11:324:26113:21:20:90:522:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  sort  are  unavailable  in  this  context.  However,  in  light  of  the  prior  evidence  on  the 
11:325:26218:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:importance   of   contextual   factors   (McCabe,   Treviño, and   Butterfield   2001),   we 
11:326:26311:21:21:90:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:conjectured that the likelihood of plagiarism would be related to the many unobservables 
11:327:26400:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:associated  with  particular  instructors  (e.g.,  types  of  writing  assignment,  writing  support, 
11:328:26502:20:21:90:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and the apparent threat of detection) and with particular academic disciplines. Our review 
11:329:26593:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of  the  syllabi  and  writing  assignments  for  the  participating  courses  provided  some 
11:330:26687:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:confirmation  for  these  priors  (e.g.,  the  presence  of  a  plagiarism  warning  on  the  syllabus 
11:331:26790:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and  the  extent  to  which  writing  assignments  involved  a  student's  response  to  instructor-
11:332:26890:20:21:90:522:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:chosen   source   material   as   opposed   to   researching   a topic   through   self-identified 
11:333:26989:21:20:90:149:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:references). 
11:334:27002:20:7:233:236:109:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
11:335:27050:7:16:90:521:102:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:5  One  instructor  provided  no  reason  for  refusing  while  a  second  instructor  was  uncomfortable  with  using 
11:336:27168:16:12:90:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:Blackboard despite the facilitation by the research team. Three other instructors refused because they were 
11:337:27276:12:0:90:426:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:uncomfortable with the "deception" of students, despite the data-security protocols. 
12:338:27364:0:21:125:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Based   on   the   available   baseline   information   about   the   courses   and   their 
12:339:27456:21:21:89:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructors,  we  paired  courses  prior  to  randomization  in  the  following  manner.  First,  for 
12:340:27558:21:20:89:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:12 of the participating courses, we were able to  form pairs among  courses taught by the 
12:341:27648:20:21:89:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:same professor in the same department (and, in 6 of these cases, randomization was also 
12:342:27736:21:21:89:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:within  sections  of  the  same  course).  Second,  for  10  other  courses,  randomization 
12:343:27828:21:21:89:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:occurred  among  courses  taught  in  the  same  department.  In  cases  where  there  were 
12:344:27920:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:multiple  courses  from  a  given  department,  we  paired  courses  that  had  similar  writing 
12:345:28017:20:21:89:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assignments as indicated by the syllabi (e.g., research content of the assignments and the 
12:346:28108:21:21:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:presence  of  a  plagiarism  warning).  The  remaining  6 courses  were  paired  to  another 
12:347:28201:21:20:89:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:course in the same academic division (i.e., social sciences or humanities) using the same

12:351:28359:20:21:125:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In  the  courses  assigned  to  the  treatment,  students were  required  to  complete  a 
12:352:28449:21:21:89:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Blackboard-based  tutorial  on  understanding  and  avoiding  plagiarism.  The  tutorial  was 
12:353:28543:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:adapted   for   Blackboard   from   resources   available   at the   Plagiarism   Resource   Site

12:355:28736:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The tutorial required students to click through 18 sequential screens with text that defined 
12:356:28829:21:21:89:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:different  forms  of  plagiarism.  This  tutorial  also  provided  explicit  examples  of  what 
12:357:28925:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:constitutes  plagiarism  by  showing  side-by-side  examples  of  source  material  along  with 
12:358:29021:20:21:89:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:examples of the correct and incorrect use of that material in a student paper. The tutorial 
12:359:29113:21:21:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:also  outlined  effective  strategies  for  avoiding  plagiarism  (e.g.,  not  procrastinating  and 
12:360:29213:21:20:89:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:careful note-taking). At the end of this sequence  of material, students  completed a nine-
12:361:29304:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:question quiz consisting of several detailed and example-driven questions on plagiarism. 
12:362:29393:21:21:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Each  response  triggered  detailed  feedback  on  why  that  answer  was  either  correct  or 
12:363:29488:21:21:89:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:incorrect before proceeding to the next question. Appendix A contains several illustrative

13:370:30066:0:21:125:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:This intervention was deployed on the Blackboard sites of the treatment courses at 
13:371:30149:21:21:89:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the beginning of the third week of the semester (i.e., immediately after the date at which 
13:372:30240:21:20:89:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students could drop the course with no record of having been enrolled). The Blackboard 
13:373:30327:20:21:89:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sites made it clear that students would not be  allowed to upload their completed writing 
13:374:30417:21:21:89:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assignments (i.e., the upload mechanism would not activate) until students had completed 
13:375:30506:21:21:89:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the tutorial. However, because of the role that early research and note-taking can play in 
13:376:30597:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:unintentional  plagiarism,  the  instructors  within  the  participating  treatment  courses  were 
13:377:30696:20:21:89:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:encouraged  to  email  students  early  in  the  semester about  the  need  to  complete  the 
13:378:30790:21:21:89:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Blackboard  tutorial.  They  were  also  provided  with  the  names  and  email  addresses  of 
13:379:30885:21:20:89:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students who had not promptly completed the tutorial and encouraged to provide targeted 
13:380:30973:20:21:89:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:follow-up  reminders.  As  a  result  of  this  effort,  there  are  no  empirically  meaningful 
13:381:31070:21:21:89:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:distinctions  between  the  effects  associated  with  the  intent-to-treat  and  the  effect  of  the 
13:382:31173:21:20:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment-on-the-treated  in  this  study.  Over  97  percent  of  students  in  the  treatment 
13:383:31269:20:21:89:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:courses  fully  completed  the  tutorial  while  an  additional  1.5  percent  partially  completed

13:385:31383:21:21:125:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:An interesting and important feature of this study is that the participating students 
13:386:31469:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:were  not  aware  that  they  were  participating  in  a  research  study.8  However,  as  noted 
13:387:31566:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:earlier, the participating instructors did know that their courses were involved in a writing 
13:388:31660:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:study.  In  theory,  the  general  awareness  among  instructors  that  their  student  papers  were 
13:389:31761:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:being  externally  evaluated  in  some  way  may  have  muddied  the  treatment  contrast  by 
13:390:31855:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:encouraging  all  instructors  to  manage  these  assignments  in  a  manner  that  reduced 
13:391:31947:21:21:90:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism.  The  existence  of  sizable  treatment  effects  suggest  that,  if  there  were  any 
13:392:32046:21:20:90:525:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects  associated  with  this  general  awareness,  they  were  not  empirically  confounding. 
13:393:32143:20:32:90:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Several of the participating instructors were also clearly aware of the broad intent of the 
13:394:32235:32:7:233:236:201:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
13:395:32283:7:17:90:522:194:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:7  Students  who  exited  the  tutorial  before  completing  its  entire  sequence  were  allowed  to  upload  their 
13:396:32400:17:11:90:521:177:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:writing  assignments.  A  small  number  of  students  may  not  have  completed  the  tutorial  at  all  because  they 
13:397:32520:11:11:90:522:166:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:dropped the course or because they submitted hard copy papers directly to the instructor. We collected all 
13:398:32627:11:7:90:514:155:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:available hard copies for our analysis and assess the implications of study attrition for our key inferences. 
13:399:32737:7:16:90:521:148:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:8  Nonetheless,  the  use  of  electronic  paper  collection  as  opposed  to  printed  copies  could  conceivably 
13:400:32852:16:12:90:522:132:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:constitute  a  study-wide  deterrent  to  plagiarism.  In  theory,  this  could  compromise  the  external  validity  of 
13:401:32973:12:12:90:522:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:our results for papers that are collected as printed copies. And the fairly low prevalence of plagiarism in our 
13:402:33085:12:11:90:521:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:study  suggests  this  caveat.  If  such  an  effect  existed  it  could  also  muddy  our  treatment  contrast,  which 
13:403:33205:11:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:would bias us towards finding no effect of the intervention. However, given the magnitude of the apparent 
13:404:33311:11:12:89:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:treatment  effects  in  this  study,  this  seems  less  problematic.  Furthermore,  we  suspect  that  the  electronic 
13:405:33431:12:0:89:337:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:submission of papers is an increasingly common mechanism. 
14:406:33492:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:research  study  (i.e.,  the  focus  on  plagiarism).  Four  participating  instructors  asked  to  be 
14:407:33595:21:21:90:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:aware  of  the  study  goals  as  a  condition  of  participation  and  a  fifth  clearly  inferred  the 
14:408:33700:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:study  goals  because  he  or  she  actively  managed  other  components  of  their  Blackboard 
14:409:33796:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sites.   Fortunately,   our   block-randomization   strategy   implies   that   there   is   uniform 
14:410:33897:21:21:90:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment  and  control  variation  within  these  instructors.  Three  of  these  instructors  each 
14:411:33998:21:21:90:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:taught two of the participating courses so they were paired with other courses they taught 
14:412:34089:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:prior  to  randomization.  The  remaining  two  instructors  taught  courses  in  the  same 
14:413:34181:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:department  and  these  courses  were  also  paired  with each  other.  This  pattern  of  pairing 
14:414:34280:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:implies  that  any  effects  that  might  be  associated  with  an  awareness  of  the  study's  focus 
14:415:34383:21:20:90:444:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:should again create an attenuation bias in the estimated treatment effects.

14:422:34870:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and web pages. An  "originality report" also makes it possible to connect suspicious text 
14:423:34960:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  the  potentially  plagiarized  source.  At  a  pilot  stage  for  this  project,  we  compared  the 
14:424:35064:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:performance  of  this  service  to  that  of  other  available  software  and  found  that  it  was 
14:425:35164:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:particularly discriminating both with respect to its extensive database and with regard to 
14:426:35255:20:21:89:388:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:identifying plagiarized text that may have been lightly edited. 
14:427:35319:21:21:125:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Settings for the originality reports allowed most quoted text and bibliographies to 
14:428:35403:21:20:90:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:be  ignored  in  generating  similarity  scores.  Nonetheless,  our  review  of  the  similarity 
14:429:35500:20:21:90:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:scores from the papers in this field experiment indicated that a large share of the highest 
14:430:35592:21:21:90:522:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:similarity  scores  reflected  false  positives.  This  occurred  when  the  software  failed  to 
14:431:35690:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:recognize  correct  citations  of  quoted  material  and when  it  flagged  oddly  formatted 
14:432:35783:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:bibliographies  as  plagiarized  text.  For  example,  some  high  similarity  scores  occurred 
14:433:35879:20:52:90:522:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:when a paper legitimately quoted other text but used margin offsets instead of quotation 
14:434:35968:52:8:233:236:98:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
14:435:36016:8:16:90:521:90:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:9 As part of the human-subject protocols for this research, all of the collected papers were assigned random 
14:436:36125:16:0:90:523:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:identifiers and anonymized (e.g., names removed from file name, paper titles and headers) prior to analysis. 
15:437:36237:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:marks.   We   also   found   that   some   high   similarity   scores   were   simply   due   to   the 
15:438:36340:21:21:90:453:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:accumulation of common word fragments used throughout a given paper.10 
15:439:36410:21:20:126:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Given  the  pervasive  amount  of  measurement  error  in the  similarity  scores 
15:440:36492:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:generated  by  Turnitin.com,  we  adopted  a  straightforward  rating  strategy  using  multiple 
15:441:36589:21:21:90:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:reviewers.  We  first  reviewed  the  papers  with  high  similarity  scores  (i.e.,  15  or  higher). 
15:442:36692:21:21:90:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Roughly  half  of  these  had  clearly  plagiarized  content  while  the  remaining  papers 
15:443:36784:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:appeared to be false positives exclusively. We then reviewed each paper with a similarity 
15:444:36874:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:score between 11 and 15. Of these papers, roughly one third had plagiarized content. We 
15:445:36962:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:then  reviewed  the  papers  with  similarity  scores  between  8  and  10.  Only  16  percent  of 
15:446:37061:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:these papers were judged to have plagiarized content. As we moved to (and through) the 
15:447:37148:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:third   strata,   the   probability   of   having   identifiable   plagiarism   clearly   dropped. 
15:448:37247:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Furthermore, within the lower stratum, the extent of plagiarism in papers with plagiarized 
15:449:37338:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:content  was  substantially  lower.  Interestingly,  our  exhaustive  review  of  these  papers 
15:450:37434:20:21:90:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicated  that  the  plagiarism  that  did  occur  was  predominately  of  the  "mosaic"  variety 
15:451:37533:21:21:90:352:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(e.g., copied sentences, sentence clauses and phrases). 
15:452:37589:21:21:126:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our  analysis  focuses  on  a  binary  dependent  variable  that  indicates  whether  a 
15:453:37677:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:paper had plagiarized content and was in the two rating strata defined by similarity scores 
15:454:37769:20:21:90:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of  11  or  higher.  This  focus  reflected  a  judgment  that  the  plagiarism  that  occurred  in  the 
15:455:37874:21:21:90:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:highest  two  strata  was  distinctly  more  consequential  in  scale.  However,  as  robustness 
15:456:37971:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:checks,  we  also  present  results  based  on  binary  indicators  for  more  and  less  restrictive 
15:457:38073:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:measures   of   plagiarism   (i.e.,   papers   identified   as having   plagiarized   content   with 
15:458:38174:21:21:90:393:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:similarity scores of 15 or higher and 8 or higher, respectively).

15:461:38261:20:21:126:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  28  participating  courses  had  collective  enrollment  of  697  students.11  The 
15:462:38349:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:writing  assignments  in  these  28  courses  and  the  corresponding  course  enrollments 
15:463:38440:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:implied that there were 1,329 potential papers to be collected. Because attrition from the 
15:464:38531:20:30:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:collection  of  papers  is  a  potential  threat  to  both the  internal  and  external  validity  of  our

15:466:38686:7:16:90:522:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:10 In  his recent book on plagiarism, Posner (2007, page 84) discusses Turnitin.com and  notes it  generates 
15:467:38795:16:7:90:430:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:false positives because of indented quotations and the flagging of incidental phrases. 
15:468:38882:7:16:90:521:90:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:11 However, because some unique students were enrolled in more than one participating course, there were 
15:469:38986:16:0:89:223:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:573 unique students in the study. 
16:470:39023:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:study, we made  an aggressive effort, in cooperation with the participating instructors, to 
16:471:39115:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:obtain physical copies of papers that were submitted as print outs rather than through the 
16:472:39206:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:web-based  upload  mechanisms.  More  specifically,  nearly  6  percent  of  the  potential 
16:473:39298:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:papers  (i.e.,  79  of  1,329)  were  obtained  as  printouts.  Through  the  use  of  scanning  and 
16:474:39399:21:21:90:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:optical  character  recognition  (OCR)  software,  we  were  able  to  convert  these  papers  to 
16:475:39497:21:21:90:326:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:searchable text and include them in our analysis. 
16:476:39547:21:20:126:525:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our  final,  analytical  sample  consisted  of  1,259  papers,  implying  a  fairly  low 
16:477:39636:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:attrition  rate  of  5.3  percent  (i.e.,  70/1,329).  The  attrition  of  these  70  papers  was  due  in 
16:478:39743:21:21:90:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:part to students who withdrew from courses or had taken a grade of incomplete (n = 19). 
16:479:39831:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The remaining papers (n = 51) were either not submitted or were submitted directly to the 
16:480:39921:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructor as printed copies that we could not obtain. As we discuss below, the differences 
16:481:40013:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in   attrition   across   treatment   and   control   classrooms   were   small   and   statistically 
16:482:40115:21:20:90:156:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:insignificant. 
16:483:40130:20:21:126:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:We  were  able  to  identify  a  number  of  student  traits  (e.g.,  race,  gender,  SAT 
16:484:40220:21:21:89:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:scores)  through  access  to  the  institution's  administrative  data  (Table  1).  The  composite 
16:485:40320:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(math and verbal) SAT scores were imputed for those who only had ACT composite data

16:487:40498:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:identify  other  student  traits  (e.g.,  class  status, pass/fail  status)  from  the  class  enrollment 
16:488:40604:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:data.12 We also identified several class-level observables (e.g., class size, the presence of

16:490:40800:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:academic rank and gender of the instructor) that may be relevant determinants of student

16:496:41106:21:21:90:453:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:analysis of the data. We estimate variants of the following OLS regression:

16:499:41256:7:16:90:522:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:12 A small number of potential papers (n = 31), only one of which was lost to attrition, were from students 
16:500:41364:16:11:89:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:who  were  taking  a  course  at  the  participating  institution  but  were  not  enrolled  there.  Because  of  their

17:514:42491:21:21:89:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:conditions will ensure that all observable and unobservable characteristics of students and 
17:515:42583:21:20:89:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:classrooms are balanced across the two groups. In small samples, however, it is possible

17:523:43284:20:21:89:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:participating  institution.  There  are  an  equal  proportion  of  males  and  females,  and

17:526:43565:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:21 percent of students do not indicate a race/ethnicity on school records. The majority of

17:528:43752:21:21:89:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:All freshmen take their fall courses pass/fail and roughly 6.8 percent of other students are

17:533:44116:7:0:90:390:79:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:13 Here we abstract away from student-by-paper as the unit of observation. 
18:534:44194:0:21:125:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Columns 2 and 3 present classroom-level summary statistics for the treatment and 
18:535:44275:21:21:90:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:control  groups.    In  none  of  these  comparisons  do  we  find  that  the  treatment-control 
18:536:44372:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:differences  are  statistically  significant.  This  is striking  because,  in  conducting  these 
18:537:44470:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:“multiple  comparisons,”  one  might  expect  to  sometimes  reject  some  null  hypotheses  of 
18:538:44566:21:21:90:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:no   difference,   even   when   the   null   hypotheses   are   true.   Various   procedures   (i.e., 
18:539:44669:21:21:90:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Bonferroni  and  Benjamini-Hochberg)  are  designed  to correct  for  the  Type  I  errors  in 
18:540:44764:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:multiple  comparisons.  These  corrections  would  only imply  that  the  p-values  in  Table  1 
18:541:44861:20:21:90:167:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are even larger. 
18:542:44878:21:21:126:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:However,   multiple-comparison   procedures   that   also   allow   for   a   joint   error 
18:543:44970:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:structure  across  these  comparisons  might  create  a  more  powerful  test  of  the  treatment-
18:544:45068:20:21:90:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:control  differences  in  baseline  covariates.  As  an  alternative  way  to  test  whether  we  are 
18:545:45170:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:likely  to  observe  this  distribution  of  covariates  under  the  null  hypothesis  of  random 
18:546:45268:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assignment, we conduct a permutation test analogous to Fischer’s exact test.14  To do so, 
18:547:45358:20:21:89:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:we  conduct  a  1,000  replications  in  which  we  randomly  assign  treatment  status  to  14  of 
18:548:45458:21:21:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the 28 classrooms (keeping the covariates in the classrooms fixed as they are in reality).  
18:549:45550:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:We  then  run  a  seemingly  unrelated  regression  with  each  of  the  covariates  as  outcomes 
18:550:45648:21:20:89:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and  a  treatment  indicator  as  the  single  predictor  in  each  equation.    We  obtain  the  F-
18:551:45748:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:statistic  from  a  joint  test  of  the  null  hypothesis that  the  coefficients  on  the  treatment 
18:552:45851:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicator for all equations are equal to zero. We then ascertain at which point the true F-
18:553:45942:21:20:89:522:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:statistic we obtained in our sample would fall in the distribution of the 1,000 F-statistics 
18:554:46035:20:21:89:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:we  obtained  from  our  permutations.    The  p-value  from  this  exercise  indicates  that  we 
18:555:46133:21:21:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cannot reject the null hypothesis of random assignment.  We also conducted an identical 
18:556:46221:21:20:89:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:permutation test, but instead of running a SUR, we estimate a single equation OLS model 
18:557:46309:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in which the treatment indicator is the dependent variable and all 20 of the covariates are 
18:558:46401:21:21:89:149:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:predictors.   
18:559:46415:21:21:125:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In summary, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of random assignment, and thus 
18:560:46495:21:26:89:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:it appears that our covariates are reasonably well balanced. However, the results in Table 
18:561:46586:26:8:233:236:144:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
18:562:46634:8:16:90:521:136:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:14 Given the small number of observations (i.e., 28) and the relatively large number of covariates we have 
18:563:46741:16:12:89:522:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:(i.e., 20), many standard regression techniques that rely on asymptotic results do not  work.  For example, 
18:564:46849:12:11:89:521:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:the  SUR  and  OLS  regression  approaches  described  above  failed  miserably  in  simulation  exercises.  We 
18:565:46961:11:11:89:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:generated a test data set with 28 observations and 20 covariates, which were drawn at random but were set 
18:566:47067:11:12:89:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:to  match  the  means  and  covariances  of  the  20  covariates  in  our  actual  data.    We  then  randomly  assigned 
18:567:47187:12:0:90:505:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:treatment status to 14 of the 28 classrooms, and estimated the SUR and OLS models described above.   
19:568:47291:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1  suggest  that  there  were  some  noticeable  treatment-control  differences  in  classroom-
19:569:47386:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:level  traits.  For  example,  treatment  classrooms  were  substantially  more  likely  to  have  a 
19:570:47487:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:female  instructor  and  less  likely  to  be  taught  be  a  full  professor.  We  examine  the 
19:571:47584:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:robustness of our impact estimates to these statistically insignificant differences through 
19:572:47676:21:21:90:334:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regression adjustments for classroom observables.

19:575:47747:20:21:126:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Even  if  randomization  results  in  good  balance  across  treatment  and  control 
19:576:47832:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:groups,  differential  sample  attrition  between  the  conditions  may  still  result  in  a  biased 
19:577:47934:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimate  of  the  treatment  effect.  For  example,  if  students  in  treatment  classrooms  were 
19:578:48034:20:21:90:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more likely to drop the class when they feel uncertain about their writing skill, the result 
19:579:48127:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:may be that control classrooms have a disproportionate fraction of good writers who may 
19:580:48215:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have a lower propensity to plagiarize even in the absence of the treatment. This dynamic 
19:581:48304:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:would   lead   our   empirical   strategy   to   underestimate any   beneficial   impact   of   the 
19:582:48404:21:21:90:141:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment. 
19:583:48415:21:21:126:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:To test for the presence of differential attrition, we estimate specifications similar 
19:584:48502:21:20:90:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to equation (1) where the outcome is a binary indicator for whether we have any outcome 
19:585:48590:20:21:90:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:data  for  the  student-paper  observation.  We  estimate  a  variety  of  different  variations  on 
19:586:48691:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  basic  specification,  and  in  no  case  does  assignment  to  the  treatment  group  have  a 
19:587:48792:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:statistically  significant  or  substantively  important  impact  on  attrition.  Hence,  sample 
19:588:48889:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:attrition  does  not  appear  to  be  a  concern  with  respect  to  the  internal  validity  of  our 
19:589:48991:21:21:90:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:results.  Furthermore,  the  low  level  of  attrition  also  suggests  that  its  implications  for  the 
19:590:49097:21:20:90:305:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:external validity of this study are negligible.

19:593:49186:21:21:126:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:While  our  final  analysis  sample  contains  over  1,200  student-paper  observations, 
19:594:49275:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the treatment was randomly assigned across only 28 classrooms. As others have pointed 
19:595:49361:20:21:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:out,  the  nested  structure  of  the  data  has  important  implication  for  accurately  estimating 
19:596:49463:21:21:90:522:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the precision of the treatment effects and conducting statistical inference (Bertrand et al.

19:598:49655:20:0:90:521:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Specifically,  statistical  inference  must  take  into account  the  within-group  dependence  in 
20:599:49757:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  data.  A  common  approach  is  to  report  cluster-robust  standard  errors  that  generalize 
20:600:49857:21:21:90:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  White  (1980)  heteroskedasticity-consistent  estimates  of  OLS  standard  errors.  Such 
20:601:49952:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cluster-robust standard errors provide consistent estimates as the number of clusters goes 
20:602:50043:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to infinity.  In practice, however, many  applied studies use samples with a small number 
20:603:50133:21:21:90:146:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of clusters. 
20:604:50146:21:21:126:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Several  recent  papers  demonstrate  that  cluster-robust  standard  errors  may  not  be 
20:605:50237:21:20:90:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:consistent  when  the  number  of  clusters  is  as  small (Cameron  et  al.  2008,  Donald  and 
20:606:50334:20:21:90:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Lang 2007). More importantly, the direction of the bias generally leads one to over-reject 
20:607:50425:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  null  hypothesis.  In  the  analysis  below,  we  present  a  several  alternative  estimates 
20:608:50524:21:20:90:463:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:suggested in the recent literature. There are two broad approaches we pursue. 
20:609:50602:20:21:126:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  first  strategy  utilizes  group-level  data.  In  our  case,  this  means  that  we  will 
20:610:50698:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:collapse  our  data  to  the  classroom  level  and  estimate  specifications  like  the  following 
20:611:50798:21:21:90:298:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:using the 28 classroom-level observations:

20:613:50858:23:20:89:522:416:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:where  yc  is  the  rate  of  plagiarism  in  classroom  c.  For  the purpose  of  inference,  we 
20:614:50956:20:21:89:521:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:calculate  bias-adjusted  robust  standard  errors  to  account  for  heteroskedasticity.  The  bias 
20:615:51057:21:21:89:522:375:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:adjustment  we  use  is  HC2  (described  in  Angrist  and Pischke  (2009))  and  is  meant  to 
20:616:51153:21:20:89:521:354:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:adjust  for  the  finite-sample  bias  of  the  commonly  used  "robust"  (White  1980)  standard 
20:617:51251:20:21:89:123:334:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:errors. 
20:618:51259:21:21:125:522:313:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:A  variant  of  this  group-data  approach  is  a  two-step  procedure  that  allows  us  to

21:635:52225:21:20:90:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:distribution  with  C-K  degrees  of  freedom  (where  C  is  the  number  of  group-level 
21:636:52316:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:observations  and  K  is  the  number  of  regressors)  to conduct  inference  on  estimates  from 
21:637:52415:21:21:90:204:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:all group-level models. 
21:638:52439:21:21:126:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our  second  broad  approach  directly  utilizes  the  micro  (i.e.,  student-level)  data. 
21:639:52531:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:One of the virtues of using the micro data is that it facilitates identifying heterogeneity in 
21:640:52626:20:21:90:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment effects by student-level traits. However, our approach still needs to account for 
21:641:52718:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  nested  structure  of  the  data  and  the  relatively  small  number  of  classrooms  in  our 
21:642:52818:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sample.  To  do  so,  we  calculate  and  report  bias-corrected  clustered  standard  errors  using 
21:643:52919:20:21:90:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the method proposed by Bell and McCaffrey (2002). This procedure, called bias-reduced 
21:644:53005:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:linearization or BRL, is essentially a generalization of the HC2 correction for the case of 
21:645:53097:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:clustering.  In  recognition  of  the  within-group  dependence  and  the  small  number  of 
21:646:53190:20:21:90:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:clusters,  we  conduct  inference  based  on  a  t-distribution  with  C-K  degrees  of  freedom 
21:647:53287:21:21:90:434:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:despite the fact that the estimation utilizes student-level observations.15 
21:648:53362:21:21:126:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Furthermore,   we   also   show   results   from   the   bootstrap-based   approaches 
21:649:53448:21:20:90:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:recommended  in  Cameron  et  al.  (2008).  These  authors  propose  cluster  bootstrap-t 
21:650:53538:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:procedures  to  improve  inference  in  cases  with  a  small  number  of  clusters.  Bootstrap 
21:651:53634:21:21:90:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimates   of   a   t-statistic   provide   "asymptotic   refinement"   because   the   asymptotic 
21:652:53734:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:distribution  of  the  t-distribution  does  not  depend on  any  unknown  parameters  (unlike 
21:653:53829:20:21:90:522:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regression  coefficients,  whose  asymptotic  distribution  depends  on  the  unknown  residual 
21:654:53925:21:21:90:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:variance).  In  a  bootstrap-t  procedure,  one  calculates  a  t-statistic  for  each  bootstrap 
21:655:54023:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sample,  and  compares  the  t-statistic  from  the  original  sample  to  the  distribution  of  t-
21:656:54123:20:21:90:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:statistics from the bootstrap replications. If the absolute value of the original t-statistic is 
21:657:54220:21:21:90:522:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:above  the  95th  percentile  of  the  absolute  values  from  the  bootstrap  distribution,  one 
21:658:54318:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:rejects  the  null  hypothesis  at  the  5  percent  level. While  this  approach  provides  some 
21:659:54416:21:20:90:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:efficiency gains, it does not yield standard errors, which might be of independent interest, 
21:660:54509:20:18:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for example to calculate a confidence interval. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations,

21:662:54646:7:17:90:521:125:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:15 Angrist and Pischke (2009) recommend using the  maximum of robust and conventional standard errors 
21:663:54748:17:11:89:521:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:for inference since robust standard errors can be subject to considerable sampling variance.  In practice, the 
21:664:54859:11:11:89:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:BRL standard errors are virtually identical to the conventional standard errors, both of which are larger than 
21:665:54970:11:12:89:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:the standard cluster-robust standard errors.  In discussing our results,  we present the BRL standard errors, 
21:666:55080:12:0:89:483:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:effectively adopting the conservative rule of thumb recommended by Angrist and Pischke (2009). 
22:667:55178:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Cameron  et  al.  (2008)  recommend  using  a  wild-cluster  bootstrap  rather  than  a  simple 
22:668:55274:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:block  bootstrap.  The  wild-cluster  bootstrap  re-samples  residuals  while  holding  the 
22:669:55366:21:20:90:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regressors fixed. A key advantage of this approach is that it avoids bootstrap replications 
22:670:55458:20:21:90:521:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in which β or var(β) are inestimable, as can happen more frequently with a small number 
22:671:55546:21:21:89:428:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of clusters when the treatment varies exclusively at the cluster level.16

22:674:55630:20:21:125:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:We begin by presenting in Table 2 some descriptive evidence on the relationship 
22:675:55710:21:21:89:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:between  various  student  and  class  characteristics  and  the  prevalence  of  plagiarism.  For 
22:676:55809:21:20:89:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this exercise, we use our main plagiarism indicator (i.e., papers with similarity scores of 
22:677:55901:20:21:89:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:11  or  higher  that  were  rated  as  plagiarism  by  multiple  raters)  and  simply  note  that  the 
22:678:56004:21:21:89:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:results are qualitatively the same using the other measures. Column 1 presents estimates 
22:679:56093:21:20:89:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:from  a  series  of  bivariate  OLS  regressions  that  model  an  indicator  for  plagiarism  as  a 
22:680:56194:20:21:89:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:function  of  a  single  student  or  classroom  characteristics.  The  standard  errors  for  the 
22:681:56293:21:21:89:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:student  level  regressors  are  clustered  by  student  whereas  the  standard  errors  for  the 
22:682:56391:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:classroom  regressors  are  clustered  by  class  with  a bias-reducing  linearization  (BRL) 
22:683:56485:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:adjustment.17 Column 2 presents estimates from a single regression model in which all of 
22:684:56574:20:21:89:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the student and classroom characteristics shown are entered jointly as regressors. Hence, 
22:685:56664:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:column  1  shows  the  unconditional  relationship  between  a  particular  regressor  and  the 
22:686:56760:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:outcome whereas column 2 shows the conditional relationship between the regressor and 
22:687:56846:20:21:89:154:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the outcome. 
22:688:56859:21:21:125:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Several  interesting  patterns  emerge.  In  column  1,  we see  that  African-American 
22:689:56947:21:20:90:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and  Asian  students  are  more  likely  to  plagiarize  than  other  students  while  students  with 
22:690:57049:20:21:90:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:higher  SAT  scores  are  less  likely  to  plagiarize.  Indeed,  the  relationship  between  SAT 
22:691:57147:21:21:90:522:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:score and plagiarism appears convex. The joint model in column 2 indicates that there is 
22:692:57236:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:still  a  significant  relationship  between  SAT  score and  plagiarism,  even  after  controlling 
22:693:57336:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for other factors. The large positive coefficient on African-American students disappears, 
22:694:57427:20:30:90:385:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:but the positive effect for Asian students remains significant.

22:696:57539:7:16:90:522:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:16  We  are  very  grateful  to  Doug  Miller  for  providing STATA  code  we  use  to  implement  the  wild-cluster 
22:697:57656:16:7:90:286:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:bootstrap method used in Cameron et al. (2008). 
22:698:57704:7:16:90:521:90:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:17  More  specifically,  the  standard  errors  reflect  cluster  adjustments  and  a  "bias  reducing  linearization" 
22:699:57823:16:0:89:268:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:(BRL) adjustment, which we discuss below. 
23:700:57868:0:21:125:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  relationship  between  SAT  score  and  plagiarism  is  quite  strong.  The  bottom 
23:701:57957:21:21:89:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:quintile of students at the school, who scored between 1,000 and 1,200 on the SAT, had 
23:702:58044:21:20:89:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism   rates   of   nearly   14   percent.   Using   the   estimates   from   column   2   and 
23:703:58145:20:21:89:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:extrapolating  out  of  sample,  we  would  predict  that  students  scoring  at  the  national 
23:704:58241:21:21:89:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:average  on  the  SAT  (a  score  of  1,017)  would  have  rates  of  17.7  percent  and  students  at 
23:705:58344:21:21:89:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the 25th percentile of national SAT scores (i.e., 850) would have a plagiarism rate of 31.7 
23:706:58436:21:20:89:524:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent.  These  results  are  consistent  with  prior  work  indicating  that  lower-performing 
23:707:58533:20:21:89:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students  are  more  apt  to  plagiarize  (McCabe,  Treviño,  and  Butterfield  2001).  And 
23:708:58625:21:21:89:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:perhaps  not  surprisingly,  students  taking  classes  pass/fail  are  significantly  less  likely  to 
23:709:58729:21:20:89:362:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarize than those taking the course for a letter grade. 
23:710:58789:20:21:125:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:As  an  initial  view  of  the  treatment  effect,   Figure  1  shows  histograms  of 
23:711:58875:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:unadjusted plagiarism rates by classroom organized so that the class pairs are adjacent to 
23:712:58966:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:each  other.  The  asterisks  below  the  horizontal  axis indicate  pairs  comprised  of  one 
23:713:59061:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructor  teaching  two  classes.  In  11  out  of  14  pairs,  the  average  plagiarism  rate  in  the 
23:714:59167:21:21:90:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:control  classroom  exceeds  that  in  the  treatment  classroom.  In  2  out  of  3  of  the  other 
23:715:59268:21:21:90:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cases, there were no cases of plagiarism in either classroom. Hence, the plagiarism rate in 
23:716:59360:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the control classroom exceeded the rate in the paired treatment class in only 1 out of 14 
23:717:59450:20:21:90:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:pairs.  Simple  nonparametric  tests  based  on  these  means  suggest  that  the  intervention 
23:718:59546:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:substantially  reduced  the  prevalence  of  plagiarism. For  example,  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum

23:720:59732:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:control  conditions  with  a  p-value  of  .008  for  a  two-sided  test.  An  analogous  test  using 
23:721:59834:21:21:90:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:adjusted  classroom  means  derived  from  a  regression that  includes  all  of  the  student  and 
23:722:59934:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:classroom covariates shown in Table 2 also rejects the null of equality with a p-value of 
23:723:60024:20:21:90:117:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:.048.

23:726:60055:21:20:125:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Tables  3  and  4  present  parametric  estimates  of  the treatment  effect  to  properly 
23:727:60146:20:21:89:522:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:quantify the magnitude and determine the statistical precision of the effect. We start with 
23:728:60238:21:21:89:522:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:specifications  that  use  classroom-aggregate  data  as  a  conservative  estimate  of  the 
23:729:60331:21:20:89:522:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:precision of our treatment effect estimates. In Panel A of Table 3, the dependent variable 
23:730:60422:20:0:89:522:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is the unadjusted classroom mean plagiarism rate, which ranges from zero to .31. Column 
24:731:60513:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:1 shows the results from a model that includes no other covariates besides the treatment 
24:732:60602:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicator, weights each classroom observation equally and does not make any adjustment 
24:733:60689:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to  the  standard  errors.  The  resulting  point  estimate  of  -0.036  suggests  that  the  treatment 
24:734:60793:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:reduced  plagiarism  by  roughly  3.6  percentage  points, a  very  large  effect  given  the 
24:735:60887:21:21:90:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:classroom-level  control  mean  of  5.6  percent  (i.e.,  a  decrease  of  64  percent).  With  a 
24:736:60985:21:21:90:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:standard error of .024, however, this point estimate is not statistically different than zero. 
24:737:61080:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:However,  after  controlling  for  either  class-level  observables  or  pair  fixed  effects,  this 
24:738:61181:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:impact  estimate  becomes  statistically  significant.  In  particular,  introducing  pair  fixed 
24:739:61279:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects has virtually no effect on the impact estimate but increases its statistical precision 
24:740:61374:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:appreciably.  Furthermore,  the  robust  and  HC2  standard  errors  are  quite  similar  to  the 
24:741:61472:20:21:90:415:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:conventional standard errors in the pair fixed-effects specification.  
24:742:61543:21:21:126:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Panel  B  shows  the  key  results  from  the  two-step  estimation  procedure  described 
24:743:61633:21:20:90:522:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:above, including different sets of controls and with different weights (i.e.,  equation (4)). 
24:744:61727:20:21:90:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Our  preferred  specification  in  column  6  includes  student  characteristics  and  pair  fixed 
24:745:61826:21:21:90:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:effects, and weights the second-step regression with the inverse of the covariance matrix 
24:746:61916:21:21:90:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:on the classroom fixed effects in step one. The resulting point estimate of -.023 is smaller 
24:747:62009:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:but  statistically  significant,  with  a  p-value  of  .027.    This  impact  estimate  implies  a  41 
24:748:62113:20:21:90:411:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percent reduction in plagiarism relative to the control group mean. 
24:749:62181:21:21:126:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Table  4  presents  the  estimated  treatment  effect  conditional  on  student  covariates 
24:750:62273:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and  the  pair  fixed  effects.  Interestingly,  the  BRL-adjusted  standard  errors  shown  in 
24:751:62369:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:column 3 are nearly identical to the conventional standard errors shown in column 1, both 
24:752:62459:21:21:90:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of which are substantially  larger than the typical cluster-robust standard errors shown in 
24:753:62551:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:column  2.  Indeed,  the  standard  error  in  column  3  is  virtually  identical  to  the  GLS 
24:754:62648:20:21:90:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimate  from  Table  3,  Panel  B,  column  6.  Columns  4  and  5  present  results  from  the 
24:755:62746:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:standard  block  bootstrap-t  and  the  wild  cluster  bootstrap-t  suggested  by  Cameron  et  al. 
24:756:62846:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(2008), which should provide more efficient estimates. The 95% confidence intervals of 
24:757:62933:21:20:90:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  t-statistics  come  from  10,000  replications  of  the  bootstrap.    The  p-value  reported 
24:758:63032:20:21:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicates  the  fraction  of  the  10,000  replications  in  which  the  t-statistic  was  larger,  in 
24:759:63135:21:21:90:406:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:absolute value, than -2.684, the t-statistic from the full sample.     
24:760:63206:21:20:126:522:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Taken together, these results suggest a treatment effect that is large in magnitude, 
24:761:63291:20:0:90:522:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:statistically  significant  and  robust  to  a  variety  of  alternative  strategies  to  calculating  the 
25:762:63401:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:standard  errors.18  Table  5  presents  several  additional  robustness  checks.  Column  1 
25:763:63494:21:21:89:522:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:replicates  the  estimates  from  column  3  of  Table  4  as  a  baseline.  Columns  2  and  3  show 
25:764:63596:21:20:89:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that using more and less restrictive definitions of plagiarism (i.e., similarity scores 15 or 
25:765:63690:20:21:89:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:above and 8 or above, respectively) do not materially change our results. Some students 
25:766:63778:21:21:89:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:in our sample appear in multiple classes. As a result, roughly 11 percent of students were 
25:767:63869:21:21:89:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:simultaneously  in  at  least  one  treatment  and  control  classroom.  For  these  students,  it  is 
25:768:63972:21:20:89:521:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:possible  that  exposure  to  the  treatment  in  one  class  might  have  influenced  behavior  in 
25:769:64072:20:21:89:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:other classes. For this reason, the specification in column 4 assigns treatment status to all 
25:770:64166:21:21:89:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:observations of students who were in at least one treatment class. The results are virtually 
25:771:64259:21:20:89:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:identical to the baseline. In column 5, we limit the sample to classroom pairs in which the 
25:772:64351:20:21:89:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructor taught both the treatment  and control  classes.  In column 6, we  re-estimate the 
25:773:64445:21:21:89:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:main  specification  dropping  all  observations  from  the  four  pairs  in  which  one  of  the 
25:774:64543:21:20:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:instructors  in  the  pair  was  known  to  be  broadly  aware  of  the  objective  of  the  study.19 
25:775:64644:20:21:90:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:While  the  point  estimates  differ  slightly   across  these  specifications,  they  are  not 
25:776:64740:21:21:90:318:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significantly different than the baseline results. 
25:777:64791:21:21:126:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Columns  7-9  show  results  for  logit  and  probit  models  as  well  as  OLS.  With  the 
25:778:64883:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:full set of baseline student and classroom controls, many observations drop from the non-
25:779:64972:20:21:90:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:linear models.  For this reason, the specifications in columns 7-9 include  a limited set of 
25:780:65065:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:covariates.20 In addition, we report conventional standard errors, which Table 4 indicates 
25:781:65156:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:are virtually identical to the BRL-adjusted standard errors. The OLS estimate in column 7 
25:782:65246:20:21:89:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is slightly large than the baseline estimate shown in column 1, as one would expect since 
25:783:65336:21:21:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:we  drop  classroom  pairs  with  no  observed  cases  of  plagiarism  (and  thus  no  potential 
25:784:65433:21:20:89:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment effect). More importantly, however, the average marginal effect from the probit 
25:785:65523:20:44:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:(column  8)  and  logit  (column  9)  models  yield  very  similar  results  to  those  in  column  7. 
25:786:65626:44:7:233:236:189:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
25:787:65674:7:16:90:522:182:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:18  In  results  not  reported  here  but  available  upon  request,  we  examined  the  impact  of  the  intervention  on 
25:788:65797:16:11:90:521:166:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:student  grades  in  subsequent  courses.  We  found  no  statistically  significant  or  substantively  important 
25:789:65911:11:7:90:126:155:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:impacts. 
25:790:65920:7:16:90:522:148:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:19  While  we  did  not  systematically  inform  instructors  of  the  purpose  of  the  study,  several  instructors 
25:791:66038:16:12:89:521:132:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:insisted on knowing as a condition of participation and others inadvertently discovered the objective while 
25:792:66146:12:7:89:317:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:working with the electronic submission system we used. 
25:793:66201:7:16:90:522:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:20  These  specifications  drop  observations  with  missing  SAT  score  (no  variation  in  outcome),  drop  four 
25:794:66317:16:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:classrooms  with  no  variation  in  outcome,  drop  the  pass-fail  indicator  variable  (no  variation),  drop  the 
25:795:66435:11:12:90:522:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:indicators  for  assistant,  associate  and  visiting  professor  (almost  no  variation),  and  combine  the  Hispanic 
25:796:66555:12:0:89:443:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:and other race indicators (because the other race indicator has no variation in outcome). 
26:797:66648:0:21:90:521:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:This  suggests  that  our  baseline  OLS  results  are  robust  to  the  use  of   alternative

26:801:66787:20:21:125:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Prior  literature  as  well  as  the  analysis  shown  in  Table  2  suggests  that  the 
26:802:66876:21:21:89:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:prevalence of plagiarism varies systematically  with student characteristics.  It thus seems 
26:803:66969:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:likely that the impact of any particular intervention may also vary across students. Table 
26:804:67060:20:21:89:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:6  shows  treatment  effects  separately  for  several  key  subgroups.  In  columns  1  and  2,  we 
26:805:67161:21:21:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:see  that  the  intervention  had  a  similar  effect  on  male  and  female  college  students.21 
26:806:67259:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Columns  3-6  show  the  results  separately  by  year  in college.  The  point  estimates  are 
26:807:67355:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:roughly  equivalent  for  all  but  sophomores  (for  which  the  point  estimate  is  essentially 
26:808:67454:21:21:90:522:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:zero).  More  specifically,  though  the  treatment  effects  for  juniors  and  seniors  are 
26:809:67548:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:estimated with comparative precision, the differences in treatment effects by class are not

26:813:67862:21:20:90:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:SAT  score.  Figure  2  shows  the  treatment  effects  and  control  mean  estimated  by  local

26:816:68144:21:20:90:382:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:covariates from the primary specification described above.22

26:819:68400:21:20:90:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:SAT  score  rises,  asymptoting  to  nearly  zero  at  the  upper  end  of  the  SAT  distribution. 
26:820:68500:20:21:90:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:More interestingly, we see that the intervention had a much larger impact on students at 
26:821:68589:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the  bottom  tail  of  the  SAT  distribution.  Based  on  the  estimates  from  this  model,  we 
26:822:68687:21:21:90:522:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:would conclude that the intervention reduced the likelihood of plagiarism by roughly 10 
26:823:68775:21:20:90:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percentage  points  among  students  with  SAT  scores  below  1,200.  While  these  students 
26:824:68869:20:30:90:521:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:comprise just less than 10 percent of the students in our sample, the national average of 
26:825:68959:30:7:233:236:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
26:826:69007:7:16:90:521:113:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:21 The treatment estimate for female students becomes smaller and statistically insignificant in models that 
26:827:69116:16:7:90:341:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:control for classroom observables instead of pair fixed effects. 
26:828:69181:7:16:90:522:90:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:22  A  model  that  interacts  SAT  score  with  linear  and  quadratic  terms  of  the  SAT  score  yields  comparable 
26:829:69301:16:0:90:121:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:results. 
27:830:69313:0:21:90:522:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:math  and  verbal  SAT  scores  among  all  test-takers  in  2007  was  1,017  and  the  25th 
27:831:69407:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:percentile  was  850.  While  the  external  validity  of  any  intervention  trial  is  open  to 
27:832:69505:21:20:90:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:question,  this  treatment  heterogeneity  suggests  that  the  intervention  may  have  a  large 
27:833:69603:20:21:90:272:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:impact on the typical college student. 
27:834:69642:21:21:126:522:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:In theory, it is possible that the treatment effect may have varied with classroom 
27:835:69725:21:21:90:521:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:or  instructor  characteristics.  Unfortunately,  with  only  28  classrooms  and  14  pairs,  our 
27:836:69824:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ability  to  detect  such  differences  is  quite  limited.  The  results  shown  in  Table  7  suggest 
27:837:69928:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that impacts may have been larger in classes with female professors, professors below the 
27:838:70018:21:21:90:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:rank  of  full  professor  and  in  classes  that  did  not include  a  warning  on  the  syllabus 
27:839:70117:21:20:90:521:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:regarding plagiarism. However, none of these treatment effect differences are statistically 
27:840:70209:20:21:90:260:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significant at conventional levels.

27:843:70280:20:21:125:522:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Our   intervention   was   designed   to   reduce   the   prevalence   of   plagiarism   by 
27:844:70372:21:21:89:522:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:educating  students  about  what  constitutes  plagiarism  and  providing  them  with  effective 
27:845:70469:21:21:89:521:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:strategies  for  avoidance.  However,  it  may  also  (or  even  exclusively)  be  that  this 
27:846:70563:21:20:89:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:intervention  reduced  plagiarism  simply  by  increasing  the  perceived  likelihood  that 
27:847:70655:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism  would  be  detected  and  prosecuted.  To  assess  the  mediating  mechanisms  by 
27:848:70749:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:which this intervention was effective, we fielded a web-based survey of the participating 
27:849:70839:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students approximately one month after the end of the semester and after the collection of 
27:850:70930:20:21:89:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:writing  assignments  for  this  study  had  concluded.  The  survey  contained  10  questions 
27:851:71025:21:21:89:521:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tapping  student  attitudes  regarding  the  course  and the  instructor,  along  with  three  true-
27:852:71125:21:20:89:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:false  questions  assessing  the  student’s  knowledge  of  plagiarism  (see  Appendix  B).    The 
27:853:71224:20:21:89:521:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:response rate was 51 percent and did not differ significantly across treatment and control

27:856:71407:21:15:89:521:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:survey responses. More specifically, Table 8 reports the estimated treatment effects from 
27:857:71497:15:7:233:236:155:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:                                                 
27:858:71545:7:16:90:522:148:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:23 Because of the operating constraints implied by Blackboard's survey mechanism, student identifiers were 
27:859:71652:16:12:90:521:132:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:not available for the student-level survey responses within participating courses. Blackboard’s design also 
27:860:71760:12:12:89:522:120:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:implied  that  one  course  pair  could  not  participate in  this  follow-up  survey.  One  instructor  effectively 
27:861:71877:12:11:89:521:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:merged  the  Blackboard  site  for  two  sections  of  the same  course.  This  did  not  complicate  the  treatment, 
27:862:71994:11:11:89:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:which could be viewed only by the treatment course students in this pair.  However, because Blackboard’s 
27:863:72099:11:12:89:524:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:survey  mechanism  strips  individual  identifiers,  it was  not  possible  to  separate  treatment  and  control 
27:864:72213:12:0:89:225:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:responses for this pair of courses. 
28:865:72252:0:21:90:524:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:OLS regressions that condition on student traits and pair fixed effects, with BRL-adjusted 
28:866:72343:21:21:90:521:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:clustered  standard  errors.  The  results  in  the  first  row  of  Table  8  indicate  that,  though 
28:867:72446:21:20:90:522:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students in treatment courses were somewhat more likely to not complete the survey, this 
28:868:72535:20:21:90:522:647:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:difference was not statistically significant. In other words, the response rate to the survey 
28:869:72629:21:21:90:372:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:appears balanced across treatment and control conditions.  
28:870:72688:21:21:126:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Perhaps  most  interestingly,  the  next  row  in  Table  8 indicates  that  students  in 
28:871:72778:21:20:90:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:treatment  classes  were  substantially  more  likely  to  correctly  answer  all  the  three  quiz 
28:872:72878:20:21:90:521:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:items, which assessed student understanding of plagiarism. This is not surprising insofar 
28:873:72968:21:21:90:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:as these items were based directly on the information provided in the on-line tutorial. The 
28:874:73060:21:20:90:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:fact  that  roughly  87  percent  of  control  students  answered  all  three  items  correctly 
28:875:73156:20:21:90:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicates  that  many  students  were  aware  of  much  of the  information  contained  in  the 
28:876:73252:21:21:90:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:tutorials.  However,  the  fact  that  virtually  100  percent  of  students  in  treatment  classes 
28:877:73353:21:20:90:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:answered all three items correctly confirms that the intervention provided information to 
28:878:73443:20:21:90:521:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:a non-trivial fraction of  students and that these students retained such information for at 
28:879:73536:21:21:90:183:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:least one semester. 
28:880:73556:21:21:126:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The  remaining  rows  in  Table  8  identify  the  treatment-control  differences  for  the 
28:881:73648:21:20:90:521:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:other survey responses where responses were on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 indicating strong 
28:882:73738:20:21:90:521:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:disagreement  with  the  statement  and  5  reflecting  strong  agreement.24  Interestingly,  the 
28:883:73836:21:21:90:521:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:data  from  question  6  indicate  that  students  in  the treatment  courses  were  significantly 
28:884:73935:21:20:90:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:more  likely  to  agree  that  they  had  a  good  understanding  of  plagiarism,  a  finding 
28:885:74029:20:21:90:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:consistent with the quiz results and the educational intent of the tutorial.  In contrast, the 
28:886:74124:21:21:90:522:274:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:results  to  questions  8,  9,  and  10  suggest  that  the intervention  did  not  have  a  statistically 
28:887:74231:21:20:90:522:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significant   deterrent   effect.   That   is,   respondents   in   treatment   courses   were   not 
28:888:74332:20:21:90:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:significantly more likely to think that a professor would detect plagiarism, respond to it in 
28:889:74426:21:21:90:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:some  way  or  report  it  to  a  judiciary  committee.  As  a  composite  measure  of  student 
28:890:74522:21:21:90:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:perceptions  regarding  the  likelihood  of  detection  and  sanction  for  plagiarism,  we  also 
28:891:74620:21:20:90:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:calculated the average of survey questions 8, 9 and 10.  In the last row of Table 8, we see 
28:892:74712:20:41:90:522:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that  assignment  to  the  treatment  condition  is  not  significantly  related  to  this  composite

28:894:74862:7:16:90:482:102:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:24 In results available upon request, we confirm that we obtain comparable results if we use binary 
28:895:74962:16:12:90:512:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:outcomes reflecting the top two categories (i.e., agree or strongly agree) instead of the continuous level of 
28:896:75072:12:0:90:172:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:agreement measure.

29:898:75196:21:21:90:425:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:mechanism for the intervention was education rather than deterrence.

29:901:75279:20:21:125:521:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:Rapid technological advances (e.g., access to full-text resources and cut-and-paste 
29:902:75363:21:21:89:522:605:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:word  processing)  have  contributed  to  the  widely  held  impression  that  plagiarism  by 
29:903:75457:21:20:89:522:584:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:students  has  dramatically  increased  on  college  campuses.  Some  commentators  have 
29:904:75546:20:21:89:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:suggested that instructors and institutions should respond to this academic misconduct by 
29:905:75636:21:21:89:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:increasing  the  penalties  for  plagiarism  as  well  as the  probability  that  an  infraction  is 
29:906:75737:21:20:89:522:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:detected  (e.g.,  Galles  et  al.  2003).  In  contrast,  other observers  have  expressed  unease 
29:907:75836:20:21:89:522:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:about  fostering  increasingly  adversarial  classroom environments.  However,  despite  the 
29:908:75929:21:21:89:521:481:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:degree  of  concern  and  the  corresponding  calls  for  reform,  there  has  been  surprisingly 
29:909:76027:21:20:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:little credible evidence on how much student plagiarism actually occurs and on the policy 
29:910:76117:20:21:89:267:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:determinants of this illicit behavior.  
29:911:76157:21:21:125:521:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:The results of the unusual field experiment discussed here suggest that plagiarism 
29:912:76240:21:21:89:522:398:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is  not  all  that  common  at  selective  institutions  but  may  be  substantially  more  common 
29:913:76339:21:20:89:522:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:among college students with average SAT scores. This study also presented experimental 
29:914:76426:20:21:89:522:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:evidence  that  a  fairly  brief  but  detailed  educational  tutorial  can  be  highly  effective  at 
29:915:76529:21:21:89:522:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:reducing  the  prevalence  of  plagiarism.  An  ex-post  survey  of  the  participants  in  this 
29:916:76626:21:20:89:521:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:experiment  suggested  that  this  tutorial  was  effective  by  increasing  student  knowledge 
29:917:76722:20:21:89:521:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:about  plagiarism  rather  than  by  increasing  the  perceived  probabilities  of  detection  and

29:919:76834:21:20:125:521:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A:These results are consistent with a model of student behavior in which plagiarism 
29:920:76916:20:21:89:522:233:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:persists  in  equilibrium  because  of  rational  ignorance.  That  is,  the  available  evidence 
29:921:77014:21:21:89:521:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:clearly  suggests  that  students  have  a  generally  poor  understanding  of  what  constitutes 
29:922:77112:21:21:89:521:191:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:plagiarism.  However,  they  may  also  have  weak  incentives  to  educate  themselves  about 
29:923:77207:21:15:89:522:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:this  illicit  behavior.  College  instructors  often  view  policing  plagiarism  and  teaching

29:926:77464:16:12:90:521:132:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:effects yields a point estimate of roughly .13, which represents a moderate size effect (i.e., roughly .25 of

29:928:77696:12:11:90:522:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:instances  in  which  the  inclusion  of  classroom  covariates  instead  of  (or  in  addition  to)  pair  fixed  effects 
29:929:77819:11:11:90:521:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:leads to any substantive change in our estimates.  However, the estimate of .13 is not significantly different 
29:930:77930:11:12:90:521:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:F:than  the  estimate  of  .06  shown  in  Table  8  here.  Our  read  of  these  results  is  that  the  present  study  does

30:933:78245:21:21:90:368:688:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:detected, the penalties are often informal and fairly light.

30:939:78774:20:21:90:522:564:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:In  particular,  the  web-based  tutorial  evaluated  in  this  study  constituted  a  cost-effective

34:1068:84814:13:14:93:554:282:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Question  11 - Suppose  you  are  writing  a  research  paper.  You  have  cut  and  pasted  a  lot  of 
34:1069:84918:14:14:93:554:268:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:information  from  articles  you  found  on  web  sites  and  databases  into  a  Word  file  on  your 
34:1070:85021:14:14:93:553:254:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:computer. While writing  your essay,  you find  yourself patching together  pieces from different 
34:1071:85119:14:14:93:554:240:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sources,  and  you  have  occasionally  lost  track  of  which  ideas  were  your  own  and  which  were 
34:1072:85224:14:13:93:554:226:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:from various articles and websites. You could go back to the original sources but the prospect 
34:1073:85319:13:14:93:554:213:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:is daunting. Fortunately, if your professor queries your sources, you can legitimately claim that 
34:1074:85417:14:14:93:339:199:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:you didn’t plagiarize because it wasn’t intentional.

34:1076:85470:14:14:93:554:171:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Question 12 - Suppose it would be quite easy for you to re-tool whole sections of a paper you 
34:1077:85564:14:13:93:554:157:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:have  written  for  a  previous  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  another  course  you  are  currently 
34:1078:85670:13:14:93:554:144:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:taking.  It  is  acceptable  practice  to  re-submit  this edited  paper  –  without  checking  with  either 
34:1079:85779:14:14:93:535:130:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:professor -- because you are writing a paper for a different professor and a different course.
