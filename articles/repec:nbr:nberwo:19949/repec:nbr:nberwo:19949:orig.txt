2:36:2034:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expensive interventions to support democratic elections. Yet little evidence exists on whether elections

3:63:3055:0:27:273:341:672:144:Times:144:Times:Introduction 
3:64:3068:27:28:108:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:Can  fair  elections  enhance  the  legitimacy  of  governments  in  fragile  states?  
3:65:3155:28:27:108:513:617:144:Times:144:Times:International   development   agencies   invest   heavily   in   building   democratic   
3:66:3244:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:institutions  in  states  engaged  in  or  emerging  from  conflict,  often  supporting  
3:67:3333:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:expensive and even dangerous electoral processes (Bjornlund 2004). In part, such 
3:68:3414:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:efforts  rest  on  the  assumption  that  democratic  elections  enhance  the  domestic  
3:69:3503:27:28:108:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy  of  governments  by  increasing  citizens’  willingness  to  be  governed.  
3:70:3591:28:27:108:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:This  willingness  may  derive  from  an  individual’s  perception  of  procedural  
3:71:3675:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy, where people consider a government more legitimate when it follows 
3:72:3754:28:28:108:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:procedures  that  the  population  considers  fair  (Levi,  Sacks  and  Tyler  2009;  Tyler  
3:73:3847:28:27:108:510:396:144:Times:144:Times:1990,  2006;  Paternoster,  Brame,  Bachman,  and  Sherman  1997;  Sunshine  and  
3:74:3929:27:28:108:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:Tyler 2003; Tyler and Huo 2002), and/or outcome legitimacy, where people view 
3:75:4007:28:27:108:511:341:144:Times:144:Times:a   government   as   more   legitimate   if   it   competently   produces   public   goods   
3:76:4101:27:28:108:506:314:144:Times:144:Times:(Bernstein and Lü 2003; Fjeldstad and Semboja 2000; Guyer 1992; O’Brien 2002; 
3:77:4179:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:Levi 2006). Greater legitimacy, in turn, makes governing easier and carries with it 
3:78:4263:27:28:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:the  increased  likelihood  of  a  stable  polity,  holding  important  implications  for  
3:79:4354:28:38:108:255:231:144:Times:144:Times:domestic and global security.  
3:80:4385:38:27:144:512:193:144:Times:144:Times:   In   this   paper   we   explore   the   role   of   election   fairness   in   building   
3:81:4479:27:28:108:510:166:144:Times:144:Times:government  legitimacy  by  combining  data  from  a  randomized  controlled  trial  
3:82:4564:28:28:108:507:138:144:Times:144:Times:designed   to   improve   electoral   quality   in   Afghanistan’s   2010   Wolesi   Jirga 
3:83:4654:28:0:108:511:110:144:Times:144:Times:elections  with  data  from  a  post-election  survey  of  citizens  affected  by  the  
4:84:4745:0:27:108:506:672:144:Times:144:Times:intervention. We find that respondents in areas that held fairer elections due to our 
4:85:4831:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:treatment  were  more  likely  to  consider  their  government  legitimate  as  measured  
4:86:4921:28:27:108:511:617:144:Times:144:Times:by  proxies  of  perceived  procedural  fairness  and  performance,  including  (1)  
4:87:5006:27:28:108:511:590:144:Times:144:Times:whether  Afghanistan  is  a  democracy;  (2)  whether  the  police  should  resolve  
4:88:5091:28:28:108:511:562:144:Times:144:Times:disputes  (3)  whether  members  of  parliament  provide  services;  and  (4)  the  
4:89:5175:28:27:107:506:534:144:Times:144:Times:willingness to report insurgent behavior to security forces. Moreover, these effects 
4:90:5260:27:28:107:509:507:144:Times:144:Times:are  strongest  within  the  subsample  of  respondents  who  were  not  aware  of  the  
4:91:5349:28:27:108:512:479:144:Times:144:Times:fairness-enhancing   treatment,   leading   us   to   conclude   that   legitimacy   was   
4:92:5440:27:28:108:513:452:144:Times:144:Times:increased   by   perceptions   of   electoral   fairness   and   efficacy.   The   fairness   
4:93:5534:28:28:108:509:424:144:Times:144:Times:intervention  seems  to  affect  attitudes    by  decreasing  visible  signs  of  electoral  
4:94:5627:28:37:108:321:396:144:Times:144:Times:fraud at respondents’ local polling stations.  
4:95:5674:37:28:144:507:359:144:Times:144:Times:  We  believe  that  these  findings  linking  electoral  fairness  to  perceptions  of  
4:96:5763:28:27:108:508:331:144:Times:144:Times:government  legitimacy  are  particularly  compelling  given  the  setting:  an  election  
4:97:5854:27:28:108:507:304:144:Times:144:Times:in a country fraught with vote-rigging with what is by all accounts one of the most 
4:98:5938:28:28:107:508:276:144:Times:144:Times:corrupt  and  dysfunctional  governments  in  the  world.  Our  study  also  challenges  
4:99:6027:28:27:107:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:the  view  that  Afghan  politics  is  solely  predetermined  by  pre-existing  allegiances  
4:100:6120:27:28:107:510:221:144:Times:144:Times:along  ethnic,  class,  religious,  or  ideological  lines.  These  results  indicate  that  
4:101:6213:28:27:107:507:193:144:Times:144:Times:democratic reforms could have real political effects, even in a country with such 
4:102:6295:27:0:107:222:166:144:Times:144:Times:strong extant loyalties.  
5:103:6324:0:27:108:231:672:144:Times:144:Times:Theoretical approaches 
5:104:6347:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:A central problem of political inquiry for millennia has involved the legitimacy of 
5:105:6431:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:the  state  (Alagappa  1995;  Beetham  1991).  The  causes  and  consequences  of  
5:106:6514:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:legitimate government are central issues of political economy and were a focus of 
5:107:6596:28:28:108:512:562:144:Times:144:Times:enlightenment   era   political   philosophy,   which   was   concerned   with   nascent   
5:108:6687:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:democracies.1 In this paper, we seek to build on more recent efforts to examine the 
5:109:6771:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:empirical aspects of political legitimacy; specifically, we focus on its relationship 
5:110:6857:28:38:108:225:479:144:Times:144:Times:to democratic elections. 
5:111:6882:38:27:144:509:441:144:Times:144:Times:Definitions  of  legitimacy  vary.  For  our  purposes  we  adopt  a  minimalist  
5:112:6964:27:28:108:507:414:144:Times:144:Times:stance, considering legitimacy to be an attribute of political authority that captures 
5:113:7051:28:27:108:511:386:144:Times:144:Times:residents’  acceptance  that  state  institutions  have  “the  right  to  issue  certain  
5:114:7141:27:28:108:508:359:144:Times:144:Times:commands,  and  that  they,  in  turn,  have  an  obligation  or  duty  to  comply”  (Lake,  
5:115:7234:28:28:108:511:331:144:Times:144:Times:2010).   This   definition,   which   appears   in   the   context   of   the   state-building   
5:116:7331:28:27:108:508:303:144:Times:144:Times:literature,  is  especially  appropriate  for  Afghanistan,  where  state  institutions  are  
5:117:7425:27:28:108:508:276:144:Times:144:Times:weak,  and  multiple  actors  compete  for  political  authority  (Lyall,  Blair  and  Imai,  
5:118:7519:28:27:108:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:2013). When this acceptance translates into actual compliance with an authority’s 
5:119:7601:27:28:108:508:221:144:Times:144:Times:rules,  it  constitutes  “behavioral”  legitimacy  (Hurd  1999;  Kelman  and  Hamilton  
5:120:7689:28:48:108:507:193:144:Times:144:Times:1989; Levi, Sacks, and Tyler 2009; Tyler 2006). Compliance reduces governance

5:122:7827:19:16:108:510:126:42:Times:100:Times:1   The   second   Treatise   of   Government   by   John   Locke   provides   a   classical   example   of   
5:123:7937:16:0:108:384:110:100:Times:100:Times:enlightenment era inquiry into the causes of legitimate government.  
6:124:8009:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:costs on the part of state authority, since no government can enforce all of its laws 
6:125:8095:27:38:108:304:645:144:Times:144:Times:with direct observation and punishment. 
6:126:8135:38:27:144:510:607:144:Times:144:Times:Individuals  grant  legitimacy  by  evaluating  prior  behavior  of  political  
6:127:8215:27:28:108:507:580:144:Times:144:Times:authorities (or proto-authorities if a formal polity has not yet been constituted) and 
6:128:8302:28:27:108:508:552:144:Times:144:Times:then  decide  whether  or  not  to  accept  their  rule.  Scholars  discuss  several  factors  
6:129:8397:27:28:108:507:525:144:Times:144:Times:influencing that evaluation, but most are related  to  an  authority’s  procedural  and  
6:130:8486:28:28:107:509:497:144:Times:144:Times:distributive  actions.  Authorities  can  enhance  their  legitimacy  when  individuals  
6:131:8575:28:27:107:510:469:144:Times:144:Times:perceive  them  to  have  made  and  followed  rules  impartially  (Grimes  2006;  
6:132:8658:27:28:107:508:442:144:Times:144:Times:Prud’homme 1992; Rothstein 2009; Rothstein and Teorell 2008; Taliercio 2004), 
6:133:8736:28:28:108:507:414:144:Times:144:Times:or can lose legitimacy when citizens judge authorities to have violated procedural 
6:134:8819:28:27:108:507:386:144:Times:144:Times:fairness,  as  in  cases  of  corruption  (Rothstein  2009,  Seligson  2002).  Authorities 
6:135:8910:27:28:108:507:359:144:Times:144:Times:can maintain legitimacy even when individuals perceive an outcome to be unfair, 
6:136:8990:28:27:108:508:331:144:Times:144:Times:as  long  as  they  consider  the  procedure  generating  it  to  be  fair.  Tyler  (2006),  for  
6:137:9088:27:28:108:506:304:144:Times:144:Times:example, finds a strong empirical relationship between individuals’ evaluations of 
6:138:9171:28:28:107:507:276:144:Times:144:Times:procedural justice and legitimacy in both public and private sector settings.  
6:139:9249:28:27:143:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:Individuals may also confer more or less legitimacy on an authority based 
6:140:9323:27:28:108:508:221:144:Times:144:Times:on  their  assessment  of  competence,  often  measured  by  outcomes  such  as  public  
6:141:9412:28:27:108:508:193:144:Times:144:Times:service  delivery  and  overall  economic  and  political  performance  (Cook,  Hardin,

7:146:9846:27:28:108:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:demonstrated  a  strong  interest  in  helping  nascent  governments  establish  the  
7:147:9932:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:competent  delivery  of  basic  services  to  their  citizens  (Bately  and  McLoughlin

7:149:10101:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:2009). If an authority cannot provide goods and services, individuals may turn to 
7:150:10183:28:27:108:513:534:144:Times:144:Times:other   groups   that   can,   including   insurgents,   international   military   forces

7:153:10430:27:28:144:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:Policymakers  and  scholars  consider  the  selection  of  leaders  through  fair  
7:154:10513:28:28:108:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:elections  to  be  a  key  part  of  establishing  a  legitimate  state  (Brancati  and  Snyder

7:156:10694:27:28:108:510:369:144:Times:144:Times:2004;  Rothstein  2009).  Proponents  of  early  elections  argue  that  establishing  
7:157:10781:28:27:108:509:341:144:Times:144:Times:elected  authorities  allows  for  a  more  peaceful  way  for  parties  to  compete  for  
7:158:10872:27:28:108:511:314:144:Times:144:Times:office,  thus  increasing  the  possibility  that  a  country  will  consolidate  as  a  
7:159:10961:28:27:108:507:286:144:Times:144:Times:democracy (Diamond 2006). Even if poorly run or beset with violence, elections 
7:160:11040:27:28:108:509:259:144:Times:144:Times:may  allow  leaders  and  voters  to  begin  the  practice  of  democratic  choice  and  
7:161:11129:28:28:108:507:231:144:Times:144:Times:ultimately lead to better future elections (Berman 2007; Carothers 2007; Lindberg 
7:162:11211:28:27:108:508:203:144:Times:144:Times:2003).  The  promise  of  elections  may  also  induce  the  international  community  to  
7:163:11302:27:28:108:511:176:144:Times:144:Times:commit   peacekeeping   forces   and   development   assistance   necessary   to   help   
7:164:11392:28:27:108:508:148:144:Times:144:Times:legitimize  a  fragile  post  conflict  government  (Doyle  and  Sambanis  2006;  Fortna  
7:165:11482:27:0:108:214:121:144:Times:144:Times:2008a; Lyons 2002).  
8:166:11506:0:27:144:512:672:144:Times:144:Times:Despite   the   important   role   that   elections   may   serve   in   establishing   
8:167:11594:27:28:108:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy,  the  evidence  is  mixed.  Recent  research  identifies  many  problems  
8:168:11680:28:27:108:510:617:144:Times:144:Times:associated  with  holding  elections  in  post-conflict  environments.  Brancati  and  
8:169:11767:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:Snyder  (2009)  find  that  calling  for  an  election  too  soon  is  associated  with  an  
8:170:11860:28:28:108:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:increased  likelihood  of  renewed  fighting.  A  quick  election  may  increase  the  
8:171:11947:28:27:107:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:probability that one side or the other will ignore a loss at the ballot box and return 
8:172:12034:27:28:107:507:507:144:Times:144:Times:to war, or may result in an elected government which pursues policies that impede 
8:173:12116:28:27:107:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:further reform and instead rekindle conflict (Brancati and Snyder 2011; de Zeeuw 
8:174:12197:27:28:107:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:2008; Mansfield and Snyder 2007; Paris 2004). Further, early elections are often 
8:175:12278:28:28:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:fraudulent  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  the  interests  of  those  staging  the  
8:176:12372:28:27:107:508:396:144:Times:144:Times:elections,  a  lack  of  trustworthy  electoral  institutions,  and  the  disorganization  of  
8:177:12467:27:28:107:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:the opposition (Bjornlund 2004; Hyde 2011; Kelley  2011).  Elections  in  societies  
8:178:12552:28:27:107:508:341:144:Times:144:Times:divided  along  racial,  ethnic,  or  other  social  lines  are  also  more  likely  to  produce  
8:179:12650:27:28:107:507:314:144:Times:144:Times:immoderate  campaigns,  violence,  and  breakdown  (Snyder  2000;  Horowitz  1985;  
8:180:12734:28:27:107:508:286:144:Times:144:Times:Rabushka  and  Shepsle  1972).  Indeed,  Collier,  Hoeffler,  and  Söderbom  (2008)  
8:181:12819:27:28:107:508:259:144:Times:144:Times:find  no  evidence  that  elections  in  post  conflict  environments  reduce  the  risk  of  
8:182:12913:28:28:107:506:231:144:Times:144:Times:further war, and instead should be “promoted as intrinsically desirable rather than 
8:183:12997:28:27:107:481:203:144:Times:144:Times:as mechanisms for increasing the durability of the post-conflict peace” (471). 
8:184:13076:27:28:143:506:176:144:Times:144:Times:We seek to contribute to prior studies by exploring whether the fairness of 
8:185:13152:28:27:107:509:148:144:Times:144:Times:elections  enhances  legitimacy  of  government  in  a  conflict  setting.  To  construct  
8:186:13243:27:0:107:508:121:144:Times:144:Times:testable  hypotheses,  we  revisit  for  a  moment  the  sources  of  legitimacy.  Holding  
9:187:13338:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:elections in post conflict settings can enhance legitimacy through both procedural 
9:188:13421:27:28:108:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:and  outcome  pathways.  Elections  allow  individuals  to  choose  their  leaders  
9:189:13505:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:through a procedure that hews to clear and impartial rules. A well-organized and 
9:190:13586:27:28:108:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:implemented  election  –  which  is  inherently  public  –  might  also  signal  that  the  
9:191:13678:28:28:108:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:government  is  more  likely  to  capably  produce  public  services.  Both  of  these  
9:192:13766:28:27:107:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:arguments  also  imply  that  voters  would  not  confer  more  legitimacy  on  their  
9:193:13853:27:28:107:510:507:144:Times:144:Times:government  if  they  believed  that  a  non-governmental  actor,  such  as  foreign  
9:194:13939:28:27:107:513:479:144:Times:144:Times:election   monitors   or   foreign   donors,   contributed   to   fair   and   competent   
9:195:14030:27:28:107:509:452:144:Times:144:Times:administration  of  the  election,  since  external  interventions  are  less  likely  to  be  
9:196:14125:28:28:107:508:424:144:Times:144:Times:sustained  in  the  future.  Moreover,  they  might  also  turn  to  government  less  for  
9:197:14217:28:27:107:507:396:144:Times:144:Times:services should they perceive that it was a non-governmental actor that facilitated 
9:198:14301:27:28:107:508:369:144:Times:144:Times:fair  and  competently  administered  elections,  since  that  would  provide  a  weaker  
9:199:14391:28:27:107:510:341:144:Times:144:Times:signal  that  government  services  are  likely  to  be  administered  impartially  and  
9:200:14480:27:28:107:172:314:144:Times:144:Times:competently.

10:221:15506:27:28:107:508:290:144:Times:144:Times:Promoting  elections  has  been  a  core  component  of  the  United  States’  policy  in  
10:222:15597:28:27:107:507:262:144:Times:144:Times:Afghanistan. After the US invasion and the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Coalition 
10:223:15679:27:28:108:508:235:144:Times:144:Times:forces  immediately  began  developing  democratic  institutions,  hoping  to  promote  
10:224:15767:28:28:108:512:207:144:Times:144:Times:stability   by   establishing   a   functioning   central   government   that   had   been   
10:225:15860:28:27:108:510:179:144:Times:144:Times:undermined  by  two  previous  decades  of  internecine  conflict,  civil  war,  and  
10:226:15946:27:28:107:507:152:144:Times:144:Times:Taliban rule. Soon after the invasion, Coalition forces empanelled a Loya Jirga to 
10:227:16029:28:0:108:509:124:144:Times:144:Times:create  a  new  constitution.  In  2005,  Afghans  voted  in  the  first  elections  for  the  
11:228:16128:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:lower house of parliament (Wolesi Jirga). In 2009, Hamid Karzai won re-election 
11:229:16208:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:as president amid claims of rampant election fraud (Callen and Weidmann, 2013). 
11:230:16288:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:General  Stanley  McChrystal,  in  an  official  communication  to  President  Obama  
11:231:16374:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:requesting troops to support a “surge,” expressed his belief that the failure of the 
11:232:16459:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:2009  elections  created  a  “crisis  of  confidence”  in  the  government,  which  would  
11:233:16550:28:37:108:486:534:144:Times:144:Times:ultimately undermine the war effort without more troops (McChrystal, 2009).

11:236:16780:27:28:108:509:442:144:Times:144:Times:U.S.  commitment  to  begin  withdrawing  troops  in  July  2011.  The  international  
11:237:16867:28:28:108:508:414:144:Times:144:Times:community viewed these elections as a critical benchmark in the consolidation of 
11:238:16948:28:27:108:509:386:144:Times:144:Times:democratic  institutions  given  doubts  about  the  Karzai  government's  ability  to

11:244:17439:27:28:108:506:211:144:Times:144:Times:number of seats allocated to a province is proportional to its estimated population. 
11:245:17524:28:27:108:509:183:144:Times:144:Times:Candidates  run  “at  large”  within  the  province,  without  respect  to  any  smaller  
11:246:17614:27:0:108:507:156:144:Times:144:Times:constituency boundaries. Voters cast a Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) for 
12:247:17697:0:27:108:506:672:144:Times:144:Times:individual   candidates,   nearly   all   of   whom   run   as   independents2 Winning 
12:248:17784:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:candidates  are  those  who  receive  the  most  votes  relative  to  each  province's  seat  
12:249:17878:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:share.  For  example,  Kabul  province  elects  the  most  members  to  Parliament  (33)  
12:250:17968:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:and Panjsher province the fewest (2). The candidates who rank one through 33 in 
12:251:18048:28:37:108:443:562:144:Times:144:Times:Kabul and one through two in Panjsher win seats to the Wolesi Jirga. 
12:252:18117:37:28:144:508:525:144:Times:144:Times:SNTV  rules  create  strong  incentives  for  fraud.  SNTV  with  large  district  
12:253:18200:28:28:108:507:497:144:Times:144:Times:magnitudes and a lack of political parties creates a wide dispersion of votes across 
12:254:18285:28:27:108:508:469:144:Times:144:Times:candidates.  The  vote  margins  separating  the  lowest  winning  candidate  from  the  
12:255:18374:27:28:108:508:442:144:Times:144:Times:highest losing candidate are thus often small. This creates a high expected return 
12:256:18457:28:28:108:508:414:144:Times:144:Times:for  even  small  manipulation  for  many  candidates.  (In  contrast,  electoral  systems  
12:257:18549:28:27:108:503:386:144:Times:144:Times:with  dominant  parties  guarantee  victory  with  large  vote  margins,  and  so  non-
12:258:18636:27:28:108:511:359:144:Times:144:Times:viable  candidates  are  less  likely  to  rig  results.)  These  strong  incentives  to  
12:259:18726:28:27:108:507:331:144:Times:144:Times:manipulate voting were compounded by a weak election commission, which had 
12:260:18801:27:28:108:509:304:144:Times:144:Times:failed  to  prevent  widespread  fraud  during  the  2009  presidential  election.  We  
12:261:18889:28:28:108:511:276:144:Times:144:Times:(Callen  and  Long,  2013)  document  clear  evidence  of  election  fraud  in  the  
12:262:18974:28:91:108:502:248:144:Times:144:Times:experimental sample studied in this paper during the 2010 parliamentary contest.  
12:263:19056:91:20:108:254:157:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:                                                            
12:264:19116:20:16:108:508:137:42:Times:100:Times:2  SNTV  systems  provide  voters  with  one  ballot  that  they  cast  for  one  candidate  or  party  when  
12:265:19226:16:11:108:507:121:100:Times:100:Times:multiple  candidates  run  for  multiple  seats.  If  a  voter's  ballot  goes  towards  a  losing  candidate,  the  
12:266:19343:11:0:108:216:110:100:Times:100:Times:vote is not re-apportioned. 
13:267:19375:0:27:108:242:672:144:Times:144:Times:Research design and data 
13:268:19400:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:The  results  in  this  paper  use  data  from  a  randomized  evaluation  of  an  original  
13:269:19493:28:27:108:511:617:144:Times:144:Times:anti-fraud  monitoring  package  that  we  conducted  during  Afghanistan’s  2010  
13:270:19576:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:Wolesi Jirga election (Callen and Long, 2013), and which we recount here. In this 
13:271:19658:28:28:108:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:section  we  revisit  that  anti-fraud  monitoring  experiment  as  a  prelude  to  our  
13:272:19747:28:37:108:480:534:144:Times:144:Times:investigation of the effect of that fraud reduction on measures of legitimacy.  
13:273:19827:37:28:143:506:497:144:Times:144:Times:On election day and the day after, a team of Afghan researchers traveled to 
13:274:19903:28:27:107:510:469:144:Times:144:Times:an  experimental  sample  of  471  polling  centers.3  Because  Afghanistan  was  an  
13:275:19989:27:28:107:509:442:144:Times:144:Times:active  war  zone  during  this  period,  we  selected  polling  centers  that  met  three  
13:276:20081:28:28:107:507:414:144:Times:144:Times:criteria  to  ensure  the  safety  of  our  staff:  (i)  achieving  the  highest  security  rating  
13:277:20181:28:27:107:509:386:144:Times:144:Times:given  by  the  International  Security  Assistance  Force  (ISAF)  and  the  Afghan  
13:278:20267:27:28:107:508:359:144:Times:144:Times:National  Police  (ANP);  (ii)  being  located  in  provincial  centers,  which  are  much  
13:279:20359:28:27:107:507:331:144:Times:144:Times:safer than rural areas4; and (iii) being scheduled to operate on election day by the 
13:280:20444:27:28:108:511:304:144:Times:144:Times:Independent   Electoral   Commission   (IEC).   Figure   1   maps   our   experimental   
13:281:20533:28:50:108:148:276:144:Times:144:Times:sample. 
13:282:20541:50:20:108:254:226:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:                                                            
13:283:20601:20:16:108:508:206:42:Times:100:Times:3  We  stratified  treatment  on  province  and,  in  the  450  polling  centers  for  which  we  had  baseline  
13:284:20714:16:11:108:507:190:100:Times:100:Times:data (we added an additional 21 to the experimental sample after baseline on obtaining additional 
13:285:20812:11:12:108:509:179:100:Times:100:Times:funding),  we  also  stratified  treatment  on  the  share  of  respondents  from  the  baseline  survey  
13:286:20918:12:11:108:507:167:100:Times:100:Times:reporting  at  least  occasional  access  to  electricity  and  on  respondents  reporting  that  the  district  
13:287:21031:11:7:108:375:156:100:Times:100:Times:governor carries the most responsibility for keeping elections fair. 
13:288:21100:7:16:108:508:149:42:Times:100:Times:4  Given  budget  and  security  issues,  we  could  only  deploy  researchers  in  19  of  34  provincial  
13:289:21208:16:12:108:509:133:100:Times:100:Times:centers.  Thus  the  sample  is  not  nationally  representative  but  biased  towards  safer  areas.  Our  
13:290:21316:12:11:108:506:121:100:Times:100:Times:sample does however cover each of Afghanistan’s regions, including  those  with  a  heavy  Taliban  
13:291:21416:11:0:108:206:110:100:Times:100:Times:presence. See Figure 1.  
14:292:21445:0:37:255:360:672:144:Times:144:Times:[Figure 1 about here] 
14:293:21467:37:28:144:507:635:144:Times:144:Times:In a randomly chosen 238 of those polling centers, researchers delivered a 
14:294:21542:28:27:108:509:607:144:Times:144:Times:letter  to  Polling  Center  Managers  (PCMs)  between  10AM  and  4PM,  during  
14:295:21623:27:28:108:510:580:144:Times:144:Times:voting.  Researchers  then  visited  all  471  polling  centers  the  following  day  to  
14:296:21713:28:27:108:506:552:144:Times:144:Times:photograph  the  publicly  posted  election  returns  forms.5 The  letter  delivery 
14:297:21797:27:28:108:511:525:144:Times:144:Times:constituted  the  experimental  treatment.  The  letter  announced  to  PCMs  that  
14:298:21881:28:28:108:514:497:144:Times:144:Times:researchers   would   photograph   election   returns   forms   the   following   day   
14:299:21969:28:27:108:507:469:144:Times:144:Times:(September 19) and that these photographs would be compared to results certified 
14:300:22050:27:28:108:506:442:144:Times:144:Times:by the IEC. Neither treatment nor control sites would be affected by measurement 
14:301:22131:28:28:108:507:414:144:Times:144:Times:the day after the election, as polling staff were absent. Figure 2 provides a copy of 
14:302:22217:28:27:108:509:386:144:Times:144:Times:the  letter  in  English  (an  original  in  Dari  is  attached  as  Figure  3).  PCMs  were  
14:303:22311:27:28:108:509:359:144:Times:144:Times:asked  to  acknowledge  receipt  by  signing  the  letter.  PCMs  at  seventeen  polling  
14:304:22401:28:27:108:509:331:144:Times:144:Times:centers  (seven  percent  of  centers  receiving  letters)  refused  to  sign.  A  polling  
14:305:22493:27:28:108:507:304:144:Times:144:Times:center was designated as treated if the PCM received a letter (Letter Delivered = 
14:306:22575:28:38:108:163:276:144:Times:144:Times:1).6  
14:307:22581:38:27:143:510:238:144:Times:144:Times:  To  measure  the  fairness  of  the  election,  researchers  also  investigated  
14:308:22664:27:28:108:508:211:144:Times:144:Times:whether election materials were stolen or damaged the day after the election. Our 
14:309:22746:28:38:108:509:183:144:Times:144:Times:staff  were  careful  to  investigate  irregularities  by  interviewing  local  community  
14:310:22837:38:19:108:254:145:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:                                                            
14:311:22897:19:12:108:476:126:42:Times:144:Times:5 Of 471 polling centers, six did not open on election day. We drop these from our analysis. 
14:312:22989:12:0:108:461:114:42:Times:100:Times:6 Results below are robust to redefining treatment as both receiving and signing a letter. 
15:313:23084:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:members while not engaging IEC staff, so as not to create an additional treatment. 
15:314:23167:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:We received reports of candidate agents stealing or damaging materials at 62 (13 
15:315:23248:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:percent)  of  the  465  operating  polling  centers,  a  clear  violation  of  the  law.  We  
15:316:23342:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:define Election  Returns Form  Removed  as  an  indicator  equal  to  one  if  materials  
15:317:23431:28:37:108:491:562:144:Times:144:Times:were reported stolen or damaged by a candidate agent at a given polling center. 
15:318:23511:37:28:144:507:525:144:Times:144:Times: We have several reasons to think that stealing or damaging tallies reflects 
15:319:23587:28:28:108:507:497:144:Times:144:Times:an  intention  to  manipulate  the  ballot  aggregation  process.  Many  of  the  Electoral  
15:320:23680:28:27:108:508:469:144:Times:144:Times:Complaints  Commission  (ECC)  complaints  reported  in  Callen  and  Long  (2013)  
15:321:23764:27:28:108:508:442:144:Times:144:Times:speculated  that  the  purpose  of  stealing  materials  was  to  take  them  to  a  separate  
15:322:23859:28:28:108:513:414:144:Times:144:Times:location,   alter   them,   and   then   reinsert   them   into   the   counting   process.   
15:323:23953:28:27:108:508:386:144:Times:144:Times:Alternatively, candidates might seek to destroy all evidence of the polling center 
15:324:24036:27:28:108:510:359:144:Times:144:Times:count,  and  then  manufacture  an  entirely  new  returns  form  at  the  Provincial  
15:325:24123:28:37:108:212:331:144:Times:144:Times:Aggregation Center.  
15:326:24144:37:28:144:509:294:144:Times:144:Times:  The  treatment  (i.e.,  delivery  of  a  notification  letter)  induced  dramatic  
15:327:24229:28:28:108:508:266:144:Times:144:Times:reductions  in  three  separate  measures  of  fraud:  the  removal  or  defacement  of  a  
15:328:24321:28:27:108:507:238:144:Times:144:Times:required  provisional  vote  tally  return  form  (Election  Returns  Form  Removed); 
15:329:24407:27:0:108:511:211:144:Times:144:Times:votes  for  candidates  likely  to  be  engaged  in  fraud  based  on  their  political  
16:330:24500:0:27:108:510:672:144:Times:144:Times:connections7  (see  Callen  and  Long,  2013)  (Votes);  and  that  same  candidate  
16:331:24585:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:gaining enough votes to rank among the winning candidates in that polling station 
16:332:24667:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:(Enough Votes to Win Station). Table 1 reports estimates of the effect of treatment 
16:333:24751:27:28:107:509:590:144:Times:144:Times:on  these  three  measures,  reproducing  results  first  reported  in  Callen  and  Long,  
16:334:24843:28:28:107:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:2013. Treatment reduced the damaging and theft of forms by about 11 percentage 
16:335:24922:28:27:107:510:534:144:Times:144:Times:points  (columns  1  -  3),  votes  for  candidates  likely  to  be  engaged  in  fraud

16:337:25100:28:27:107:508:479:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood  that  those  candidates  would  rank  among  winning  candidates  by  about  
16:338:25189:27:28:107:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:10  percentage  points  (columns  7  –  9).  These  results  represent  unusually  large  
16:339:25279:28:28:107:507:424:144:Times:144:Times:treatment effects of the intervention on measures of fraud. They suggest that other 
16:340:25363:28:27:107:510:396:144:Times:144:Times:types  of  highly  visible  electoral  malfeasance  (deviations  from  the  counting  
16:341:25449:27:38:107:502:369:144:Times:144:Times:protocol, early closings of polling centers, etc.) may similarly have been reduced.

16:343:25554:37:38:107:232:294:144:Times:144:Times:The Post-Election Survey 
16:344:25579:38:27:107:507:256:144:Times:144:Times:To  measure  the  effect  of  election  fairness  on  legitimacy,  the  focus  of  this  paper,  
16:345:25676:27:28:107:508:229:144:Times:144:Times:we  combine  the  results  of  the  letter  intervention  with  data  from  a  post-election  
16:346:25770:28:28:107:509:201:144:Times:144:Times:survey  which  we  conducted  in  December  2010,  roughly  three  months  after  the  
16:347:25857:28:15:107:509:173:144:Times:144:Times:election  and  only  shortly  after  the  Independent  Election  Commission  certified

16:349:26005:20:17:108:486:138:42:g_d0_f7:100:Times:7 The political connections of candidates were carefully coded in advance. We surmised that a 
16:350:26099:17:11:108:498:121:100:Times:100:Times:connection to a provincial polling aggregator was a predictor of engagement in fraud. See Callen 
16:351:26196:11:0:108:222:110:100:Times:100:g_d0_f4:and Long (2103) for details. 
17:352:26229:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:final results. Respondents came from households living in the immediate vicinity 
17:353:26310:27:28:107:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:of 450 of the 471 polling centers in our experimental sample, for a total of 2,904 
17:354:26393:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:respondents. To obtain a representative sample of respondents living near polling 
17:355:26475:27:28:108:508:590:144:Times:144:Times:centers - generally neighborhood landmarks such as mosques, schools or markets 
17:356:26554:28:28:108:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:- enumerators employed a random walk pattern starting at the polling center, with

17:359:26812:28:27:108:512:479:144:Times:144:Times:were   interviewed   by   field   staff   of   their   own   gender.   Respondents   within   
17:360:26906:27:28:108:508:452:144:Times:144:Times:households  were  randomly  selected  using  Kish  grid.  The  survey  had  50  percent  
17:361:26995:28:38:108:494:424:144:Times:144:Times:female respondents. Enumerators conducted the survey in either Dari or Pashto. 
17:362:27073:38:27:144:509:386:144:Times:144:Times:  We  measure  perceptions  of  government  using  individuals’  responses  to  
17:363:27153:27:28:108:507:359:144:Times:144:Times:four questions. The first two questions (1 and 2 below) probe attitudes that might 
17:364:27236:28:27:108:509:331:144:Times:144:Times:contribute  to  procedural  legitimacy;  the  second  two  questions  (3  and  4  below)  
17:365:27326:27:28:108:511:304:144:Times:144:Times:measure  attitudes  related  to  outcome  legitimacy,  i.e.  competence  in  service  
17:366:27412:28:28:108:510:276:144:Times:144:Times:provision.  We  use  all  four  questions  since  any  single  question  is  unlikely  to  
17:367:27503:28:27:107:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:capture fully a citizen’s conception of legitimacy. While we sought to distinguish 
17:368:27586:27:28:107:508:221:144:Times:144:Times:between  legitimacy  related  to  procedure  and  competence,  our  specific  questions  
17:369:27675:28:0:107:509:193:144:Times:144:Times:may  straddle  the  concepts.  The  survey  asks  other  questions  about  attitudes  to  
18:370:27769:0:27:108:506:672:144:Times:144:Times:government as well, which we discuss below. We focus first on these four, as they 
18:371:27851:27:38:108:372:645:144:Times:144:Times:have a stronger a-priori tie to concepts of legitimacy.8  
18:372:27909:38:37:108:439:607:144:Times:144:Times:1. In your opinion, is Afghanistan a democracy or not a democracy? 
18:373:27976:37:28:108:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:Afghanistan is a Democracy is an indicator equal to 1 for individuals responding 
18:374:28057:28:28:108:507:542:144:Times:144:Times:“is a democracy” to this question. While citizens’ beliefs about regime type do not 
18:375:28141:28:27:108:510:514:144:Times:144:Times:directly  measure  legitimacy,  perceptions  of  a  democratic  government  should  
18:376:28225:27:28:108:508:487:144:Times:144:Times:cause  citizens  to  believe  that  they  have  a  say  in  the  procedures  leading  to  the  
18:377:28320:28:27:108:507:459:144:Times:144:Times:election of leaders. For these reasons we believe that perceptions of Afghanistan’s 
18:378:28404:27:28:108:509:432:144:Times:144:Times:status  as  a  democracy  should  indicate  beliefs  about  a  government’s  procedural  
18:379:28493:28:38:108:165:404:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy. 
18:380:28505:38:27:108:510:366:144:Times:144:Times:2.  If  you  had  a  dispute  with  a  neighbor,  who  would  you  trust  to  settle  it  
18:381:28595:27:28:108:509:339:144:Times:144:Times:(RANDOMIZE  ORDERING):  head  of  family,  police,  courts,  religious  leaders,  
18:382:28677:28:37:108:255:311:144:Times:144:Times:shura, elders, ISAF, or other? 
18:383:28708:37:28:108:511:274:144:Times:144:Times:Police   Should   Resolve   Disputes  is  an  indicator  equal  to  1  for  individuals  
18:384:28797:28:28:108:508:246:144:Times:144:Times:responding  “police”  to  this  question.  This  question  reflects  basic  trustworthiness  
18:385:28890:28:38:108:510:218:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  procedures  of  government  responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  law  and

18:387:29037:20:16:108:506:160:42:Times:100:Times:8 We did not specify these four outcomes in a pre-analysis plan. To demonstrate that our results do 
18:388:29137:16:11:108:507:144:100:Times:100:Times:not  reflect  a  selective  reporting  of  results,  we  report  below  estimated  treatment  effects  using  all  
18:389:29252:11:12:108:509:133:100:Times:100:Times:survey  outcomes  that  might  measure  legitimacy.  The  timing  of  the  survey  (immediately  after  
18:390:29356:12:11:108:509:121:100:Times:100:Times:election  outcomes  were  certified)  and  its’  content  (principally  questions  on  attitudes  toward  
18:391:29462:11:0:108:468:110:100:Times:100:g_d0_f4:government) should also provide an indication that our intent was to measure legitimacy.  
19:392:29556:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:order,  a  core  component  of  legitimacy  found  in  the  literature  (Levi,  Sacks,  and  
19:393:29649:27:28:107:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:Tyler  2009).  Courts  are  in  principle  another  relevant  institution,  but  less  so  in  
19:394:29744:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:Afghanistan,  where  they  are  absent  in  much  of  the  country.  We  report  below  
19:395:29832:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:additional results using an indicator for the answer “courts” and other alternative 
19:396:29916:28:37:108:206:562:144:Times:144:Times:outcome measures.  
19:397:29935:37:28:108:510:525:144:Times:144:Times:3.  Who  is  mainly  responsible  for  delivering  services  in  your  neighborhood  
19:398:30020:28:28:108:515:497:144:Times:144:Times:(RANDOMIZE    ORDERING):    the    central    government,    your    Member    of    
19:399:30105:28:27:108:512:469:144:Times:144:Times:Parliament,   religious   or   ethnic   leaders,   the   provincial   government,   or   the   
19:400:30200:27:38:108:275:442:144:Times:144:Times:community development council?  
19:401:30232:38:28:108:509:404:144:Times:144:Times:The  variable  MP  Provides  Services  is  equal  to  one  if  individuals  responding  
19:402:30320:28:27:108:509:376:144:Times:144:Times:“Member  of  Parliament”  to  this  question.  This  question  is  intended  to  capture  
19:403:30410:27:28:108:509:349:144:Times:144:Times:whether  or  not  an  individual  links  service  provision  to  an  elected  government  
19:404:30500:28:27:108:509:321:144:Times:144:Times:official,  since  that  provision  is  important  to  establishing  legitimacy  related  to  
19:405:30593:27:28:108:508:294:144:Times:144:Times:competence.  This  question  allows  us  to  measure  the  concept  against  the  specific  
19:406:30685:28:28:108:508:266:144:Times:144:Times:institution,  the  parliament,  voted  on  in  this  particular  election.  The  alternative  
19:407:30779:28:27:108:508:238:144:Times:144:Times:answer  “central  government”  is  more  tangentially  related  to  the  election,  since  
19:408:30870:27:38:108:486:211:144:Times:144:Times:parts of it are not elected. We report results below using that measure as well.  
19:409:30952:38:27:108:509:173:144:Times:144:Times:4.  In  your  opinion,  how  important  is  it  for  you  to  share  information  about  
19:410:31041:27:0:108:507:146:144:Times:144:Times:insurgents to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) (for example, pending 
20:411:31124:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:IED  attacks  or  the  location  of  weapons  caches):  is  it  very  important,  somewhat  
20:412:31216:27:38:108:278:645:144:Times:144:Times:important, or not at all important? 
20:413:31252:38:27:108:508:607:144:Times:144:Times:Important  to  Report  IED  to  ANSF  is  an  indicator  equal  to  one  for  individuals  
20:414:31343:27:28:108:510:580:144:Times:144:Times:responding  “Very  Important”  or  “Somewhat  Important”  to  this  question.  The  
20:415:31427:28:27:108:509:552:144:Times:144:Times:question  is  intended  to  measure  whether  or  not  citizens  view  the  ANSF  as  a  
20:416:31516:27:28:108:508:525:144:Times:144:Times:competent  provider  of  security,  an  important  service  to  a  highly  vulnerable  and  
20:417:31608:28:38:108:213:497:144:Times:144:Times:war-torn population.  
20:418:31630:38:37:257:358:459:144:Times:144:Times:[Table 2 about here] 
20:419:31651:37:28:143:503:422:144:Times:144:Times:Table  2  reports  summary  statistics  for  these  variables  from  the  post-
20:420:31730:28:28:108:508:394:144:Times:144:Times:election  survey.  The  data  depict  a  country  with  uneven  support  for  government.  
20:421:31821:28:27:108:507:366:144:Times:144:Times:About 68 percent of respondents view Afghanistan as a democracy, while only 18 
20:422:31900:27:28:108:510:339:144:Times:144:Times:percent  prefer  the  police  as  their  primary  means  of  dispute  adjudication.  20  
20:423:31989:28:27:108:508:311:144:Times:144:Times:percent  of  respondents  believe  that  the  Member  of  Parliament  is  responsible  for  
20:424:32081:27:28:108:507:284:144:Times:144:Times:providing services, while 94 percent respond that reporting an impending attack to 
20:425:32164:28:38:108:226:256:144:Times:144:Times:the ANSF is important.  
20:426:32188:38:27:144:509:218:144:Times:144:Times:  In  Table  2  we  also  find  a  high  incidence  of  electoral  malpractice  at  the  
20:427:32277:27:28:108:508:191:144:Times:144:Times:polling  stations  linked  to  survey  respondents.  At  13.4  percent  of  polling  stations  
20:428:32372:28:27:108:506:163:144:Times:144:Times:our staff recorded a report of candidate agents removing tallies (Form Removed). 
20:429:32453:27:0:108:506:136:144:Times:144:Times:A similar picture emerges from the baseline interviews, collected in August 2010, 
21:430:32539:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:which we return to below.9 Our data also include two important descriptors of the 
21:431:32621:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:environment  that  the  elections  were  held  in:  the  number  of  local  military  events

21:433:32808:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:Combined Information Data Network Exchange (CIDNE) database), with a mean 
21:434:32882:28:28:108:509:562:144:Times:144:Times:of  2.6;  and  whether  or  not  the  polling  station  was  visited  by  an  international  
21:435:32975:28:27:108:508:534:144:Times:144:Times:monitor  on  election  day,  which  occurred  in  16.5  percent  of  the  sample  (from  
21:436:33064:27:38:108:238:507:144:Times:144:Times:Democracy International).

21:438:33111:37:28:144:507:432:144:Times:144:Times: Table 3 reports summary statistics and verifies balanced randomization of 
21:439:33185:28:28:108:507:404:144:Times:144:Times:our  anti-fraud  intervention  between  treatment  and  control  polling  stations,  using  
21:440:33277:28:27:108:507:376:144:Times:144:Times:our baseline survey of August 2010. Treatment status is balanced across baseline 
21:441:33358:27:28:108:509:349:144:Times:144:Times:measures  for  all  four  key  outcomes  used  in  the  study,  which  we  expect  given  
21:442:33448:28:56:108:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:randomization.10 We find no evidence of imbalance on other measures that might

21:444:33587:33:16:108:507:232:42:Times:100:Times:9 Similar to the endline survey, we sampled respondents for the baseline, enumerators were told to 
21:445:33686:16:12:108:509:216:100:Times:100:Times:begin  at  the  polling  center  and  survey  either  6  or  8  subjects.  Surveys  were  conducted  in  
21:446:33791:12:11:108:509:204:100:Times:100:Times:individuals’  homes.  Enumerators  adhered  to  the  right  hand  rule  random  selection  method  and  
21:447:33895:11:21:108:427:193:100:Times:144:Times:respondents within houses were selected according to a Kish grid (Kish, 1949). 
21:448:33973:21:16:108:507:172:42:Times:100:Times:10  For  reasons  of  safety,  we  did  not  collect  identifying  information  from  our  subjects  and  so  the  
21:449:34088:16:12:107:506:156:100:Times:100:Times:respondents in our post-election (December 2010) survey are likely to not be the same respondents 
21:450:34186:12:11:107:506:144:100:Times:100:Times:as  in  our  pre-election  (August  2010)  survey.  The  same  sampling  protocol  was  maintained  across  
21:451:34294:11:12:107:507:133:100:Times:100:Times:both  waves.  We  therefore  view  baseline  balance  on  our  key  outcome  measures  as  an  additional  
21:452:34401:12:11:107:508:121:100:Times:100:Times:indication  that  the  measured  treatment  effect  is  not  due  to  pre-existing  differences  between  the  
21:453:34512:11:0:107:235:110:100:Times:100:Times:treatment and control samples.

22:465:35168:28:27:108:507:297:144:Times:144:Times:imply that the notification letter should improve attitudes that enhance procedural 
22:466:35252:27:28:108:510:270:144:Times:144:Times:and  outcome  legitimacy.  Since  assignment  of  the  fraud-reducing  treatment  is  
22:467:35338:28:28:108:510:242:144:Times:144:Times:randomized,  we  need  not  be  concerned  with  selection  bias  or  other  omitted  
22:468:35424:28:27:108:509:214:144:Times:144:Times:variable  biases.  In  Panel  A,  we  report  the  effect  of  fraud  reduction  on  citizens’  
22:469:35520:27:28:108:507:187:144:Times:144:Times:beliefs about procedural legitimacy. Columns 1 – 3 suggest that treatment causes 
22:470:35601:28:27:108:508:159:144:Times:144:Times:an  increase  in  respondents’  beliefs  that  Afghanistan  is  a  democracy,  though  the

23:478:36055:27:28:108:504:580:144:Times:144:Times:preference   for   using   formal   procedures   rather   than   informal   institutions   --
23:479:36148:28:27:108:507:552:144:Times:144:Times:abundantly  available  in  Afghanistan--  for  dispute  resolution.  Treatment  causally  
23:480:36238:27:28:108:510:525:144:Times:144:Times:increases  reported  willingness  to  use  police  by  2.3  percentage  points  in  the  
23:481:36327:28:28:108:507:497:144:Times:144:Times:uncontrolled specification and by 3.6 percentage points with a full set of controls 
23:482:36411:28:27:108:507:469:144:Times:144:Times:(column  6).12  The  latter  result  is  statistically  significant  at  the  five  percent  level  
23:483:36511:27:38:108:360:442:144:Times:144:Times:and provides supportive evidence for Hypothesis 1.  
23:484:36563:38:28:144:508:404:144:Times:144:Times:In Panel B, columns (1)-(3), we find that the fraud reduction intervention 
23:485:36638:28:27:108:512:376:144:Times:144:Times:causally   increased   beliefs   that   members   of   parliament   are   responsible   for   
23:486:36732:27:28:108:507:349:144:Times:144:Times:providing services by 4.1 percentage points, compared to a base of 17.8 percent in 
23:487:36815:28:27:108:507:321:144:Times:144:Times:the  control  group,  supporting  Hypothesis  2.  This  result  is  statistically  significant  
23:488:36911:27:33:108:507:294:144:Times:144:Times:and  robust  to  the  addition  of  a  broad  set  of  controls,  as  reported  in  columns  (2)  
23:489:37009:33:20:108:254:261:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:                                                            
23:490:37069:20:16:108:506:241:42:Times:100:Times:11 For ease of exposition, we restrict our sample to respondents who provide some response to the 
23:491:37167:16:12:107:507:225:100:Times:100:Times:four  questions  corresponding  to  our  main  outcome  and  to  our  question  regarding  whether  they  
23:492:37273:12:11:107:506:213:100:Times:100:Times:were aware that the monitoring exercise was conducted by outsiders. All specification in Tables 4 
23:493:37371:11:12:107:508:202:100:Times:100:Times:and  5  therefore  have  either  2313  (specifications  including  polling  centers  without  pre-election  
23:494:37479:12:11:107:509:190:100:Times:100:Times:survey  data)  or  2200  (specifications  including  only  polling  centers  with  pre-election  data)  
23:495:37583:11:12:107:507:179:100:Times:100:Times:observations.  Results  (unreported)  are  nearly  identical  removing  this  restriction,  though  sample  
23:496:37691:12:11:107:509:167:100:Times:100:Times:sizes  vary  between  specifications  according  to  the  number  of  respondents  providing  some  
23:497:37791:11:7:107:335:156:100:Times:100:Times:response to the question used as the dependent variable.  
23:498:37849:7:16:108:509:149:42:Times:100:Times:12  The  difference  in  point  estimates  is  partly  due  to  the  difference  in  samples.  Moving  from  
23:499:37958:16:12:107:506:133:100:Times:100:Times:column (4) to column (5), the sample is reduced by 18 polling centers and 113 respondents. These 
23:500:38055:12:11:107:508:121:100:Times:100:Times:18  polling  centers  are  part  of  the  sample  of  21  polling  centers  in  Kabul  that  we  added  to  the  
23:501:38168:11:0:107:333:110:100:Times:100:Times:experiment after the completion of the baseline survey.  
24:502:38229:0:27:108:509:672:144:Times:144:Times:and  (3)  (as  expected  with  random  assignment  to  treatment).  Still  in  Panel  B,  
24:503:38319:27:28:108:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:columns (4)-(6) report effects on citizens’ attitude that it is important to cooperate 
24:504:38406:28:27:108:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:with  security  forces  by  reporting  IEDs.  Treatment  increases  reported  willingness  
24:505:38497:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:to  report  by  2.5  percentage  points  (column  (4))  in  the  specification  without  
24:506:38586:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:controls, and by 3 percentage points in the specification with a full set of controls. 
24:507:38673:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:Both  results  are  statistically  significant,  and  again  support  Hypothesis  2,  that  
24:508:38765:27:38:107:340:507:144:Times:144:Times:electoral fairness enhances outcome legitimacy. 
24:509:38813:38:27:143:507:469:144:Times:144:Times:In summary, the electoral fraud reduction treatment increased perceptions 
24:510:38887:27:28:107:509:442:144:Times:144:Times:of  legitimacy  of  the  Afghan  government  for  four  measures  of  procedural  and  
24:511:38974:28:28:107:508:414:144:Times:144:Times:outcome  legitimacy.  Those  effects  were  statistically  significant  for  three  of  the  
24:512:39067:28:27:107:507:386:144:Times:144:Times:four measures. Figure 4 summarizes those results graphically, reporting treatment 
24:513:39149:27:38:108:397:359:144:Times:144:Times:effects and 95% confidence intervals for the four measures. 
24:514:39209:38:37:273:378:321:144:Times:144:Times:[Figure 4 about here] 
24:515:39231:37:28:144:508:284:144:Times:144:Times:Turning  to  other  measures  of  legitimacy  collected  in  our  survey,  we  find  
24:516:39316:28:27:108:511:256:144:Times:144:Times:additional   evidence   that   electoral   fraud   reduction   improved   perceptions   of   
24:517:39409:27:28:108:509:229:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy.  Our  survey  includes  seven  additional  measures  related  to  attitudes  
24:518:39498:28:28:108:511:201:144:Times:144:Times:toward  government  and  willingness  to  be  governed.  For  instance,  we  also  
24:519:39581:28:27:108:510:173:144:Times:144:Times:included  a  question  about  another  important  concept  found  in  discussions  of  
24:520:39668:27:28:108:509:146:144:Times:144:Times:government  legitimacy  regarding  taxation.  Respondents  were  asked  to  rank  the  
24:521:39755:28:0:108:509:118:144:Times:144:Times:importance  of  paying  taxes  as  “not  at  all  important,”  somewhat  important,”  or  
25:522:39849:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:“very  important.”13 14  Table  5  reports  the  results  of  estimating  treatment  effects  
25:523:39942:27:28:107:510:645:144:Times:144:Times:for  these  measures.  Five  of  the  seven  additional  measures  yield  estimated  
25:524:40027:28:27:107:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:treatment effects in the direction predicted by theories of procedural fairness and 
25:525:40111:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:public  service  provision.  Of  these,  two  are  statistically  significant  at  the  99  
25:526:40203:28:37:107:352:562:144:Times:144:Times:percent level, both of which are related to taxes.15  
25:527:40257:37:28:144:513:525:144:Times:144:Times:Table   5   also   reports   treatment   effects   aggregated   across   outcome   
25:528:40340:28:28:107:508:497:144:Times:144:Times:measures.  Following  Kling,  Liebman,  and  Katz  (2007)  and  Casey,  Glennerster,  
25:529:40426:28:27:107:509:469:144:Times:144:Times:and  Miguel  (2013),  we  estimate  standardized  treatment  effects,  standardizing  
25:530:40512:27:28:108:508:442:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes  by  subtracting  their  mean  and  dividing  by  their  standard  deviation  so  
25:531:40603:28:27:108:508:414:144:Times:144:Times:that  all  outcomes  are  measured  in  standard  deviation  units.  We  then  create  an  
25:532:40694:27:28:108:507:387:144:Times:144:Times:index which is simply the arithmetic average of these standardized outcomes. We 
25:533:40774:28:28:108:508:359:144:Times:144:Times:calculate  separate  indexes  for:  (i)  the  four  dependent  variables  used  in  our  main  
25:534:40869:28:27:108:510:331:144:Times:144:Times:analysis;  (ii)  the  seven  additional  outcomes  reflecting  alternative  measures  of  
25:535:40959:27:21:108:508:304:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy  related  to  either  conditional  consent  or  service  provision;  and  (iii)  all  
25:536:41056:21:19:108:254:283:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f4:                                                            
25:537:41116:19:16:108:507:264:42:Times:100:Times:13 For the full text for these questions and a description of how they are coded to create outcome 
25:538:41215:16:7:108:225:248:100:Times:100:Times:measures see the Appendix.  
25:539:41243:7:16:108:507:241:42:Times:100:Times:14  We  also  estimated  treatment  effects  on  dummy  variables  set  equal  to  one  when  respondents  
25:540:41350:16:12:107:510:225:100:Times:100:Times:indicate   supporting   the   Central   Government,   Provincial   Government,   or   local   Community   
25:541:41456:12:11:107:506:213:100:Times:100:Times:Development  Council  as  the  unit  that  should  provide  services.  Consistent  with  our  main  results,  
25:542:41566:11:12:107:508:202:100:Times:100:Times:we  find  a  significant  and  negative  treatment  effect  for  the  provincial  government,  which  is  
25:543:41672:12:11:107:504:190:100:Times:100:Times:appointed  rather  than  elected.  However,  this  may  be  due  just  to  a  simple  adding  up  constraint  –
25:544:41783:11:7:107:329:179:100:Times:100:Times:since the choices are exclusive-- so we do not report it. 
25:545:41841:7:16:108:506:172:42:Times:100:Times:15 We report estimates using as dependent variables dummy variables equal to one for respondents 
25:546:41938:16:12:107:507:156:100:Times:100:Times:indicating  that  (i)  paying  taxes  is  very  important,;  (ii)  paying  taxes  is  somewhat  important;  and  
25:547:42051:12:11:107:506:144:100:Times:100:Times:(iii) paying taxes is somewhat or very important.  The third is the sum of the first two. We report 
25:548:42151:11:12:107:506:133:100:Times:100:Times:estimates for all three in order to indicate the insignificant but negative estimate corresponding to 
25:549:42253:12:11:107:507:121:100:Times:100:Times:(i).  If  we  remove  (iii)  from  the  additional  variable  index  and  all  variable  index  the  estimates  are  
25:550:42370:11:0:107:407:110:100:Times:100:Times:nearly identical and remain statistically significant at the 99 percent level.  
26:551:42454:0:27:108:510:672:144:Times:144:Times:11  variables.  Estimated  treatment  effects  on  these  indices  are  all  statistically  
26:552:42546:27:28:107:506:645:144:Times:144:Times:significant at the 95 percent level, even after adjusting p-values to reflect multiple 
26:553:42633:28:37:107:444:617:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis testing using the method of Young and Westfall (1993).16  
26:554:42702:37:38:257:358:580:144:Times:144:Times:[Table 5 about here] 
26:555:42723:38:28:144:509:542:144:Times:144:Times:The  estimated  treatment  effect  of  0.10  standard  deviations  for  the  four  
26:556:42806:28:27:108:508:514:144:Times:144:Times:primary outcome variables is comparable in size to the estimated effect using the 
26:557:42888:27:28:108:511:487:144:Times:144:Times:index  calculated  using  the  remaining  seven  measures  as  an  outcome  (0.06  
26:558:42971:28:27:108:507:459:144:Times:144:Times:standard deviations). In summary, estimated treatment effects using the additional 
26:559:43054:27:28:108:509:432:144:Times:144:Times:seven  measures  and  indices  based  on  all  measures  yield  results  that  strongly  
26:560:43143:28:28:108:512:404:144:Times:144:Times:reinforce   the   conclusion   of   Table   4:   treatment   improved   attitudes   toward   
26:561:43236:28:37:108:375:376:144:Times:144:Times:government and increased willingness to be governed.

26:564:43359:37:28:108:510:264:144:Times:144:Times:  Hypotheses  3  and  4  state  that  an  individual  will  not  credit  government  with

26:566:43541:28:27:108:510:208:144:Times:144:Times:enhancements  in  election  fairness  were  caused  by  a  non-governmental  (i.e.,  
26:567:43626:27:36:108:506:181:144:Times:144:Times:external) intervention. Our survey asked respondents if they had knowledge of the

26:570:43870:16:0:108:183:110:100:Times:100:Times:Anderson (2008).

27:572:43977:27:28:108:511:645:144:Times:144:Times:responded  that  they  were  aware.  Table  6  repeats  the  analysis  of  Table  4,  
27:573:44063:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:estimating the same equation with an added indicator variable Aware of Delivery, 
27:574:44144:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:which takes the value one if the respondent is in the treated sample and responded 
27:575:44227:28:28:108:506:562:144:Times:144:Times:that   they   had   knowledge   about   the   treatment.   These   estimates   are   not 
27:576:44316:28:27:108:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:experimental,  since  awareness  was  not  randomly  assigned  within  the  treatment  
27:577:44403:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:group;  nor  is  there  any  means  to  identify  the  comparison  group  in  the  control  
27:578:44495:28:37:108:454:479:144:Times:144:Times:sample who would have been aware of treatment had they been treated. 
27:579:44564:37:38:275:376:442:144:Times:144:Times:[Table 6 about here] 
27:580:44585:38:28:143:509:404:144:Times:144:Times:The  estimated  coefficient  of  Aware  of  Delivery  represents  the  contrast  
27:581:44666:28:27:108:507:376:144:Times:144:Times:between the predicted value of the outcome variable for the unaware treated and 
27:582:44746:27:28:108:507:349:144:Times:144:Times:that of the aware treated. That estimate is subject to possible selection bias, since 
27:583:44832:28:27:108:508:321:144:Times:144:Times:those  aware  of  treatment  might  have  a  priori  different  outcomes.  That  would  be  
27:584:44924:27:28:108:509:294:144:Times:144:Times:true,  for  instance,  if  the  aware  were  keen  observers  of  local  politics  and  were  
27:585:45018:28:37:108:347:266:144:Times:144:Times:therefore more cynical about Afghan democracy. 
27:586:45065:37:28:144:508:229:144:Times:144:Times:Being  aware  of  letter  delivery  undermines  the  treatment  effect  for  two  of  
27:587:45151:28:28:108:510:201:144:Times:144:Times:the  four  outcome  measures.  Specifically,  for  the  outcomes  Afghanistan  is  a

27:589:45325:27:28:108:509:146:144:Times:144:Times:indicator  increases  the  size  of  the  positive  estimated  treatment  effect,  which  is  
27:590:45419:28:0:108:509:118:144:Times:144:Times:now  estimated  solely  using  the  (distorted)  aware  sample,  while  generating  an  
28:591:45511:0:27:108:507:672:144:Times:144:Times:estimated negative effect for the aware sample of at least the same size (columns 
28:592:45593:27:28:108:509:645:144:Times:144:Times:1  and  4).  While  these  estimates  are  not  experimental,  they  do  retain  their  size  
28:593:45687:28:27:108:507:617:144:Times:144:Times:when stratum fixed effects and additional covariates are added (columns 3 and 6). 
28:594:45769:27:28:108:510:590:144:Times:144:Times:For  the  other  two  variables  awareness  predicts  a  statistical  zero,  so  that  the  
28:595:45861:28:28:108:508:562:144:Times:144:Times:treatment  effect  is  statistically  the  same  for  both  aware  and  unaware  samples.  In  
28:596:45956:28:27:108:510:534:144:Times:144:Times:sum,  treatment  has  no  effect  on  outcomes  for  two  of  our  four  variables  for  
28:597:46045:27:28:108:511:507:144:Times:144:Times:respondents  aware  that  an  external  actor  was  responsible  for  delivering  the  
28:598:46132:28:27:108:507:479:144:Times:144:Times:notification letter. We interpret this as mixed but weakly supportive evidence for 
28:599:46215:27:38:108:208:452:144:Times:144:Times:Hypotheses 3 and 4. 
28:600:46235:38:28:144:509:414:144:Times:144:Times:All  told,  we  find  strong  experimental  evidence  that  the  fraud-reduction  
28:601:46317:28:27:108:507:386:144:Times:144:Times:intervention improves perceptions of procedural and outcome legitimacy. We also 
28:602:46397:27:28:108:509:359:144:Times:144:Times:find  weakly  supportive  evidence  for  the  implied  hypothesis  that  citizens  must  
28:603:46486:28:27:108:509:331:144:Times:144:Times:perceive  a  relatively  clean  election  to  be  the  consequence  of  the  actions  of  a  
28:604:46579:27:28:108:509:304:144:Times:144:Times:domestic  government,  as  opposed  to  the  result  of  an  outside  intervention,  for  
28:605:46669:28:28:108:508:276:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy  to  be  enhanced.  Taken  together,  these  results  indicate  that  even  in  a  
28:606:46763:28:27:107:511:248:144:Times:144:Times:nascent   democracy   with   weak   institutions   such   as   Afghanistan,   improving   
28:607:46853:27:28:107:507:221:144:Times:144:Times:procedural and outcome legitimacy has consequential effects on attitudes towards 
28:608:46934:28:0:107:170:193:144:Times:144:Times:government. 
29:609:46950:0:27:108:173:672:144:Times:144:Times:Conclusions 
29:610:46962:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:We  have  reported  experimental  evidence  showing  that  the  fairness  of  elections  
29:611:47051:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:affects  attitudes  of  citizens  towards  their  government  directly  relevant  to  their  
29:612:47144:27:28:108:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:willingness to be governed, a contributor to legitimacy. Experimental evidence of 
29:613:47226:28:28:108:507:562:144:Times:144:Times:this nature is new to the literature and is particularly compelling given the setting: 
29:614:47313:28:27:108:507:534:144:Times:144:Times:even in the context of an ongoing insurgency and with an infamously ineffective 
29:615:47393:27:28:108:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:government rife with corruption, we find that enhancing electoral fairness seems 
29:616:47474:28:37:108:343:479:144:Times:144:Times:to contribute to state legitimacy in Afghanistan.  
29:617:47525:37:28:144:510:442:144:Times:144:Times:These  findings  speak  both  to  policy  and  to  the  study  of  legitimacy  in  
29:618:47608:28:28:108:508:414:144:Times:144:Times:nascent  democracies.  From  a  policy  perspective,  our  results  reinforce  the  notion  
29:619:47700:28:27:108:507:386:144:Times:144:Times:that domestic legitimacy, and therefore stability, can be enhanced by interventions 
29:620:47784:27:28:108:508:359:144:Times:144:Times:that  improve  the  fairness  of  elections,  an  assumption  that  undergirds  the  current  
29:621:47878:28:27:108:507:331:144:Times:144:Times:emphasis the international community places on holding elections in fragile states 
29:622:47961:27:28:108:513:304:144:Times:144:Times:and   the   considerable   investments   it   makes   to   ensure   electoral   integrity.   
29:623:48054:28:28:108:507:276:144:Times:144:Times:Importantly, our results are mute on the effectiveness of election monitoring–the 
29:624:48136:28:27:108:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:most common intervention—as an integrity-enhancing technique. Indeed, we find 
29:625:48214:27:28:108:507:221:144:Times:144:Times:in passing some evidence suggesting that the design of election monitoring in that 
29:626:48297:28:27:108:512:193:144:Times:144:Times:Afghan   election   was   unlikely   to   enhance   perceptions   of   legitimacy,   since   
29:627:48390:27:28:108:508:166:144:Times:144:Times:interventions viewed as external did not affect attitudes. Nevertheless, our results 
29:628:48475:28:0:108:450:138:144:Times:144:Times:are supportive of integrity-enhancing interventions as a general policy. 
30:629:48552:0:27:144:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:While  we  agree  that  elections  form  the  core  institutional  component  of  a  
30:630:48637:27:28:107:507:645:144:Times:144:Times:legitimate state, our results cannot provide guidance on how fair elections must be 
30:631:48721:28:27:107:508:617:144:Times:144:Times:in  order  to  legitimize  a  government,  when  compared  to  the  counterfactual  of  no  
30:632:48813:27:28:107:507:590:144:Times:144:Times:elections  (Hoglund  et  al.  2009).  Electoral  processes  in  these  contexts  frequently  
30:633:48906:28:28:107:510:562:144:Times:144:Times:suffer  fraud  (Bjornlund  2004;  Hyde  2011;  Kelley  2011),  can  incite  violence  
30:634:48992:28:27:107:509:534:144:Times:144:Times:(Horowitz  1985;  Hyde  and  Marinov  2010;  Snyder  2000;  Wilkinson  2004),  and  
30:635:49076:27:28:107:508:507:144:Times:144:Times:may  institutionalize  former  combatants  into  uncompromising  political  parties.  In  
30:636:49166:28:27:107:510:479:144:Times:144:Times:such  circumstances,  staging  unfair  elections  in  an  attempt  to  increase  state  
30:637:49254:27:28:107:509:452:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy  may  instead  undermine  it.  That  remains  an  important  question  for  
30:638:49341:28:38:107:185:424:144:Times:144:Times:future research. 
30:639:49358:38:27:143:509:386:144:Times:144:Times:  Legitimacy  plays  a  key  role  in  theories  of  political  development,  and  
30:640:49441:27:28:107:507:359:144:Times:144:Times:should also play a role in the theory of economic development, since recognition 
30:641:49522:28:27:107:507:331:144:Times:144:Times:of government’s authority to impose rules is a necessary precondition for taxation, 
30:642:49606:27:28:107:507:304:144:Times:144:Times:service provision, protection of human rights, enforcement of property rights, and 
30:643:49689:28:28:107:511:276:144:Times:144:Times:implementation   of   development   programs—including   those   administered   by   
30:644:49774:28:27:107:507:248:144:Times:144:Times:nongovernmental organizations and international organizations such as the World 
30:645:49854:27:38:107:141:221:144:Times:144:Times:Bank.  
30:646:49861:38:27:143:508:183:144:Times:144:Times:These  findings  show  that  at  least  some  attitudes  toward  government  are  
30:647:49943:27:28:107:510:156:144:Times:144:Times:plastic:  though  it  may  be  built  on  a  base  of  unconditional  loyalties  (e.g.,  
30:648:50032:28:0:107:506:128:144:Times:144:Times:ideological, religious, or ethnic), legitimacy is affected by citizens’ perceptions of 
31:649:50123:0:27:108:508:672:144:Times:144:Times:the  integrity  of  elections.  The  theory  of  legitimacy  as  conditional  recognition  of  
31:650:50218:27:28:108:508:645:144:Times:144:Times:authority  embraces  various  theories  of  what  precisely  recognition  is  conditioned  
31:651:50309:28:27:108:509:617:144:Times:144:Times:on,  between  which  our  evidence  cannot  adjudicate.  Future  experiments  which  
31:652:50394:27:38:107:348:590:144:Times:144:Times:enhance election integrity might attempt to do so. 
31:653:50445:38:27:143:510:552:144:Times:144:Times:Along  these  lines,  future  research  might  explore  the  extent  to  which  
31:654:50525:27:28:107:510:525:144:Times:144:Times:interventions  that  improve  other  aspects  of  governance  confer  legitimacy  in  
31:655:50611:28:28:107:509:497:144:Times:144:Times:fragile  states;  improvements  in  the  integrity  not  just  of  elections,  but  also  of  
31:656:50705:28:27:107:511:469:144:Times:144:Times:policing,  justice,  health,  education  and  other  basic  services  should  enhance  
31:657:50792:27:28:108:508:442:144:Times:144:Times:legitimacy, according to theories of outcome legitimacy. Such studies might also 
31:658:50873:28:28:108:504:414:144:Times:144:Times:consider   which   types   of   legitimacy-enhancing   interventions   are   most   cost-
31:659:50962:28:27:108:510:386:144:Times:144:Times:effective,  and  how  they  compare  to  expensive  interventions  such  as  security

31:662:51124:20:16:108:510:137:42:Times:100:Times:17  On  this  note,  our  fraud-reduction  intervention  is  remarkably  inexpensive,  and  has  been  
31:663:51227:16:11:107:506:121:100:Times:100:Times:successfully replicated in two subsequent elections. Callen, Gibson, Jung, and Long (2013) report
