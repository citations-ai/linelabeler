2:33:1752:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:?:ABSTRACT
2:34:1760:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:US state chartered commercial banks are supervised alternately by state and federal regulators. Each
2:35:1860:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:regulator supervises a given bank for a fixed time period according to a predetermined rotation schedule.
2:36:1965:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We use unique data to examine differences between federal and state regulators for these banks. Federal
2:37:2068:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:regulators are significantly less lenient, downgrading supervisory ratings about twice as frequently
2:38:2168:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:as state supervisors. Under federal regulators, banks report higher nonperforming loans, more delinquent
2:39:2272:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:loans, higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower ROA. There is a higher frequency of bank failures
2:40:2372:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and problem-bank rates in states with more lenient supervision relative to the federal benchmark. Some
2:41:2474:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:states are more lenient than others. Regulatory capture by industry constituents and supervisory staff
2:42:2576:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:characteristics can explain some of these differences. These findings suggest that inconsistent oversight
2:43:2681:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:can hamper the effectiveness of regulation by delaying corrective actions and by inducing costly variability
2:44:2789:14:42:72:236:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in operations of regulated entities.

3:69:3276:0:20:72:162:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:70:3291:20:18:72:75:706:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:71:3291:18:17:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:At  least  since  Pigou  (1938),  economists  have  been  interested  in  effective  regulatory  design.  A  
3:72:3400:17:17:71:543:671:144:Times:144:Times:B:critical  element  of  this  design  involves  assessing  how  regulatory  institutions  themselves  affect  
3:73:3509:17:17:71:543:654:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  implementation  of  regulations.  This  is  a  complex  question,  as  it  often  entails  understanding  
3:74:3620:17:18:71:543:637:144:Times:144:Times:B:the interactions among several regulatory agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, as well as the 
3:75:3718:18:17:72:544:619:144:Times:144:Times:B:degree  to  which  they  are  consistent  in  implementing  the  rules.    Several  anecdotes  suggest  that  
3:76:3828:17:17:72:543:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistent oversight by regulators could hinder regulatory effectiveness, none clearer than the 
3:77:3926:17:17:72:543:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:demise of Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu), a $300 billion thrift and the sixth largest US bank 
3:78:4019:17:18:72:544:568:144:Times:144:Times:B:at  the  time  of  its  failure.1  According  to  a  formal  congressional  investigation,  WaMu’s  failure  –  
3:79:4131:18:17:72:544:550:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  largest  bank  failure  in  US  history  –  was,  to  a  large  extent,  due  to  delayed  corrective  action  
3:80:4247:17:17:72:543:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:that resulted from inconsistent oversight by its regulators, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) 
3:81:4347:17:17:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).2 Despite the relevance of this issue, little 
3:82:4446:17:18:72:546:499:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematic  evidence  exists  on  whether  there  is  differential  implementation  of  regulation  by  
3:83:4550:18:17:72:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators  –  in  banking  or  other  industries  –  its  drivers,  or  its  consequences.  We  attempt  to  fill  
3:84:4666:17:17:72:413:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:this gap by analyzing supervisory decisions of US banking regulators.  
3:85:4737:17:17:72:75:447:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:86:4737:17:18:72:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:B:The current regulatory structure in US banking provides a convenient laboratory for studying the 
3:87:4834:18:17:72:546:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue  of  regulatory  inconsistency  because  it  involves  dual  supervision  of  institutions  –  i.e.,  
3:88:4942:17:17:72:544:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervision  by  both  state  and  federal  regulators.  Using  a  natural  experiment  to  circumvent  the  
3:89:5051:17:17:72:545:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue  of  banks  self-selecting  into  different  regulatory  environments,  we  provide  evidence  of  
3:90:5156:17:18:72:543:361:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistent implementation of identical rules by federal and state regulators. This inconsistency 
3:91:5255:18:17:71:548:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:arises   due   to   differences   in   the   institutional   design   and   incentives   of   these   regulators.   
3:92:5371:17:17:71:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:Furthermore,  we  show  that  this  inconsistency  may  be  costly,  as  it  induces  variability  in  bank  
3:93:5480:17:17:71:535:309:144:Times:144:Times:B:operations, and that it may hamper the effectiveness of regulation by delaying corrective action. 
3:94:5578:17:18:71:74:292:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:95:5578:18:17:71:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Inconsistent  implementation  of  regulation  by  state  and  federal  regulators  relates  broadly  to  the  
3:96:5688:17:17:71:545:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:debate  on  effectiveness  of  dual  regulatory  structure  that  has  taken  place  in  several  industries,  
3:97:5799:17:17:71:546:240:144:Times:144:Times:B:including  banking  (see  Scott  1977;  Dixon  and  Weiser  2006).  The  fallout  from  the  recent  
3:98:5900:17:18:71:545:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial  crisis  has  triggered  massive  regulatory  reform  in  banking  (see  Brunnermeier  et  al.  
3:99:6006:18:17:71:543:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2009)). However, most of these reforms have targeted activities that should be regulated, while 
3:100:6103:17:17:71:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  discussion  on  reforming  the  current  dual  structure  of  supervision  in  banking  has  been  less  
3:101:6213:17:23:71:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:active. This paucity of discussion is not due to the lack of arguments for and against the current 
3:102:6312:23:8:72:218:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
3:103:6372:8:17:72:500:140:42:g_d0_f6:100:Times:F:1 More anecdotes on ineffective regulation due to inconsistent supervision by US state and federal banking 
3:104:6479:17:11:72:520:123:100:Times:100:Times:F:regulators are available in Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (1994). There are also abundant 
3:105:6588:11:12:72:532:112:100:Times:100:Times:F:examples of regulatory impediments due to inconsistencies between state and federal regulators in other industries 
3:106:6703:12:11:72:533:100:100:Times:100:Times:F:(see for example Lane (2004) for securities regulation, Dixon and Weiser (2006) for telecommunication regulation 
3:107:6816:11:7:72:308:89:100:Times:100:Times:F:and Esworthy (2008) for regulations on pollution control). 
3:108:6875:7:17:72:511:82:49:Times:100:Times:F:2 Absent a deal between the FDIC and JP Morgan Chase to take over WaMu’s assets, this failure would have 
3:109:6979:17:11:71:533:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:exhausted the entire Deposit Insurance Fund. More detail on the tussle between the OTS and FDIC in the run up to

3:111:7203:12:0:71:442:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:investigation report (Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (2011)).   
4:112:7295:0:17:72:544:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  structure.3  On  the  one  hand,  proponents  argue  that  informational  advantage  of  state  
4:113:7403:17:17:72:546:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisors  coupled  with  broader  perspective  of  federal  supervisors  enhances  the  nature  of  
4:114:7506:17:17:72:548:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:decision   making.   In   addition,   having   competing   supervisors   allows   for   lower   political   
4:115:7614:17:18:72:545:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:interference,  giving  banks  the  choice  of  picking  the  less  “tyrannical”  regulator  and  a  more  
4:116:7720:18:17:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficient allocation in the sense of Tiebout (1956). On the other hand, critics suggest that such a 
4:117:7820:17:17:72:545:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:complex  supervisory  structure  may  create  coordination  and  informational  problems  between  
4:118:7919:17:17:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:entities.  It  may  also  produce  regulatory  inconsistencies  and  result  in  a  “race  to  the  bottom”  in  
4:119:8032:17:18:72:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms  of  regulatory  laxity.  Lack  of  empirical  evidence  validating  or  refuting  these  claims  has  
4:120:8141:18:17:72:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:implied  that  the  debate  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  current  regulatory  structure  has  been  muted  
4:121:8252:17:17:72:244:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:and largely informed by anecdotes.

4:123:8287:17:18:72:546:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  lack  of  empirical  evidence  stems  from  two  main  difficulties.  First,  it  is  hard  to  find  
4:124:8394:18:17:72:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparable metrics of behavior across the myriad of dimensions affected by different regulators 
4:125:8490:17:17:72:544:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:overseeing different firms, in particular complex entities such as banks. To overcome this issue, 
4:126:8588:17:17:72:547:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  rely  on  the  easy-to-compare  results  of  safety  and  soundness  on-site  examinations  by  
4:127:8688:17:18:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators,  which  are  crucial  micro-prudential  supervisory  tools.  These  examinations  culminate  
4:128:8793:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  assignment  of  a  CAMELS  rating,  which  summarizes  the  conditions  of  the  bank  on  a  
4:129:8896:17:17:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:numerical scale. Second, and perhaps more challenging, it is difficult to tell if a bank picked the 
4:130:8996:17:17:72:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisor  more  suited  to  actions  it  intended  to  undertake  or  the  regulator  itself  changed  the  
4:131:9106:17:18:72:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:actions  taken  by  a  bank.  More  precisely,  a  bank’s  regulatory  setting  is  not  random,  rather  it  is  
4:132:9220:18:17:71:547:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:determined   endogenously   through   a   charter   choice,   and   thus,   driven   by   observable   and   
4:133:9329:17:17:71:242:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:unobservable bank characteristics.  
4:134:9365:17:17:71:74:347:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:135:9365:17:18:71:544:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our identification strategy exploits a legally determined rotation policy that assigns federal and 
4:136:9464:18:17:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:state supervisors to the same banks at exogenously predetermined time intervals. This allows us 
4:137:9560:17:17:71:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  circumvent  the  issue  of  banks  sorting  into  different  regulatory  settings.  The  policy  on  
4:138:9665:17:17:71:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternating  examinations  was  introduced  in  the  Riegle  Act  of  1994  and  subsequent  regulatory  
4:139:9770:17:18:71:547:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:provisions   with   the   goal   of   reducing   administrative   requirements   for   insured   depository   
4:140:9880:18:17:71:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions  (that  is,  eliminating  the  burden  of  facing  both  federal  and  state  examination  in  the  
4:141:9993:17:17:71:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:same  year).  The  law  assigns  state  chartered  commercial  banks  to  fixed  12-month  or  18-month  
4:142:10098:17:17:71:547:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:rotations  between  state  and  federal  supervisors.  In  particular,  the  rotation  involves  state  
4:143:10202:17:18:71:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators  and  the  FDIC  for  non-member  banks  (NMBs)  and  state  regulators  and  the  Federal  
4:144:10305:18:17:71:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:Reserve (Fed) for state member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System  (SMBs).  SMB  and  NMB  
4:145:10399:17:17:71:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:entities  combined  cover  a  substantial  portion  of  the  US  banking  industry,  about  30  percent  in  
4:146:10508:17:17:71:472:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of total assets and 80 percent in terms of the number of commercial banks.4

4:150:10746:11:16:72:542:70:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 Unfortunately, this excludes interesting subsamples, such as national banks, primarily overseen by the Office of the 
4:151:10865:16:12:72:522:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and thrifts, overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision until 2011:Q1, and 
4:152:10976:12:0:72:466:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:currently by the OCC.  We discuss the applicability of our results to this set of banks in Section 6. 
5:153:11081:0:17:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:The central contribution of this paper lies in its empirical design and it is best understood by this 
5:154:11183:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:simple example. Consider a bank (B) that can be supervised by either a state regulator (S) or by a 
5:155:11282:17:17:72:546:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulator  (Fed).  An  ideal  experiment  assessing  differences  in  supervisory  decisions  
5:156:11385:17:18:72:544:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  assign  B  to  both  S  and  Fed  simultaneously  and  consequently  track  differences  in  their  
5:157:11492:18:17:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:actions. Our empirical design mimics this ideal experiment closely. In particular, S and Fed are 
5:158:11589:17:17:72:542:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternatively assigned to B every t periods, with t predetermined by our policy instrument and not 
5:159:11688:17:17:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:chosen by B. This allows us to compare supervisory decisions within the same bank and estimate 
5:160:11783:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:causal effects as if we were evaluating the effect of S and Fed on B concurrently. Given that the 
5:161:11881:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:assignment of regulators is governed by a predetermined policy instrument, we are able to track 
5:162:11977:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:not only the nature of supervisory decisions of S and Fed regarding B, but also the consequences 
5:163:12074:17:17:72:307:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:of these decisions on bank B’s actual operations. 
5:164:12124:17:18:72:75:537:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
5:165:12124:18:17:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:In our main tests we use unique data to assess the difference in supervisory activities of federal 
5:166:12223:17:17:72:542:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:and state regulators. These activities involve examining depository institutions to evaluate safety 
5:167:12323:17:17:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:and soundness conditions. The process culminates in a compliance report for each bank, whose 
5:168:12416:17:18:72:544:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessment  is  summarized  by  a  CAMELS  rating,  an  acronym  for  its  six  components:  capital  
5:169:12518:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:adequacy,  asset  quality,  management  and  administration,  earnings,  liquidity,  and  sensitivity  to  
5:170:12625:17:17:72:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:market  risk.  We  identify  a  systematic  effect  of  supervisor  identity  on  these  ratings.  Federal  
5:171:12733:17:17:72:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisors  are  significantly  more  likely  to  downgrade  CAMELS  ratings  for  the  same  bank  
5:172:12834:17:18:72:543:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative to state supervisors (and, in the case of the Federal Reserve, they are also more cautious 
5:173:12934:18:17:72:546:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  upgrading  these  ratings).  These  effects  are  larger  for  Fed-state  supervised  SMBs  when  
5:174:13036:17:17:72:547:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared  with  FDIC-state  supervised  NMBs.  In  addition,  the  tougher  stance  by  federal  
5:175:13133:17:17:72:547:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators  is  subsequently  mimicked  by  their  state  counterparts,  which  do  not  appear  to  
5:176:13234:17:18:72:546:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematically  overturn  federal  decisions.  These  results  are  quantitatively  large,  as  federal  
5:177:13339:18:17:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisors  appear  twice  as  likely  to  downgrade  relative  to  state  supervisors.  We  also  examine  
5:178:13448:17:17:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  of  the  subcomponents  of  the  rating  are  responsible  for  these  effects  and  find  that  the  
5:179:13557:17:17:72:275:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects are present for all subcomponents. 
5:180:13600:17:18:72:75:261:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
5:181:13600:18:17:72:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:Next,  we  examine  if  banks  respond  to  the  heightened  threat  of  a  downgrade  stemming  from  a  
5:182:13706:17:17:72:545:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  supervisor  by  changing  their  operations.  We  find  evidence  of  substantial  changes  in  
5:183:13811:17:17:72:542:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:banking operations following federal supervision. In particular, banks report higher capital ratios, 
5:184:13912:17:18:72:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  drop  in  their  profitability,  and  a  worsening  of  their  asset  quality,  as  measured  by  the  ratio  of  
5:185:14029:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:delinquent and nonperforming loans, in presence of federal regulators. We interpret these results 
5:186:14127:17:17:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:as reflective of the supervisory authority being used by federal regulators in making a bank take 
5:187:14225:17:17:72:544:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:corrective actions to address the problems highlighted in the examination. Interestingly, several 
5:188:14323:17:18:72:539:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  these  effects  are  also  detectible  as  the  federal  supervisory  cycle,  whose  timing  is  pre-
5:189:14428:18:17:72:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:determined, approaches. This evidence suggests that banks also undertake "window dressing" in 
5:190:14522:17:17:72:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticipation of tougher federal regulators. These results are consistent with an earlier literature on 
5:191:14625:17:0:72:545:71:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  informational  value  of  bank  examinations  in  inducing  corrective  adjustments  of  a  bank’s  
6:192:14733:0:17:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:books (Berger and Davies, 1998; Gunther and Moore, 2003) and complement it by showing that 
6:193:14824:17:17:72:383:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:these effects are evident in a cleanly identified empirical setting. 
6:194:14893:17:17:72:75:692:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:195:14893:17:18:72:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:We further examine whether the more lenient supervision behavior displayed by state regulators 
6:196:14988:18:17:72:547:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  costly.  We  find  that  states  with  more  lenient  state  regulators  relative  to  their  federal  
6:197:15095:17:17:72:542:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:counterparts also have higher bank failure rates and problem-bank rates (i.e., rates of banks close 
6:198:15195:17:17:72:546:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  failing)  in  our  sample  period.  Although,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  whether  a  less  lenient  
6:199:15304:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisory stance is good or bad, this analysis does suggest that there are adverse consequences 
6:200:15402:18:17:71:546:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  state  regulators’  leniency.  When  evaluating  the  downside  of  stringency,  we  do  not  find  
6:201:15506:17:17:71:461:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:support for the hypothesis that tougher regulators constrain supply of new loans. 
6:202:15588:17:17:71:74:554:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:203:15588:17:18:71:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:We end our analysis by showing that there is substantial regional heterogeneity in the leniency of 
6:204:15687:18:17:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:state    regulators  relative  to  their  federal  counterparts  and  by  examining  reasons  behind  these  
6:205:15796:17:17:72:546:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences.  One  reason  for  a  softer  stance  by  state  supervisors  could  be  that  they  may  be  
6:206:15903:17:17:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:“captured” by the constituents they oversee. In particular, since banks only pay assessment fees 
6:207:16000:17:18:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:to state regulators (Blair and Kushmeider (2006)), it is possible that state supervisors maintain a 
6:208:16100:18:17:72:542:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:more lenient stance to ensure that banks do not shift out of a given state in search of another state 
6:209:16202:17:17:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:with  even  softer  state  regulators.  We  find  some  suggestive  evidence  supporting  this  conjecture.  
6:210:16311:17:17:72:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:The federal-state difference in supervisory downgrades increases with the size of the bank that is 
6:211:16410:17:18:72:545:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:being  supervised.  This  should  be  expected,  as  state  supervisors  may  care  more  about  bigger  
6:212:16515:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks since assessment fees are proportional to bank size. We also find evidence that supervisory 
6:213:16613:17:17:72:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:staff characteristics may explain some cross-state differences. Although our evidence is far from 
6:214:16711:17:17:72:547:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:conclusive,   we   view   it   as   a   reasonable   first   attempt   at   systematically   investigating   and   
6:215:16826:17:18:72:498:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantitatively assessing the sources of heterogeneity across federal and state regulators.  
6:216:16918:18:17:72:75:312:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:217:16918:17:17:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Overall,  while  the  paper  falls  short  of  providing  a  definitive  answer  as  to  whether  the  US  dual  
6:218:17031:17:17:72:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisory  system  is  optimal,  to  our  knowledge  it  is  the  only  paper  that  clearly  documents  
6:219:17138:17:18:72:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistent  implementation  of  the  same  set  of  rules  by  different  regulators  within  this  system.  
6:220:17249:18:17:72:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  is  a  consequential  finding,  since  inconsistencies  between  regulators  can  delay  corrective  
6:221:17356:17:17:72:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory actions (e.g., the case of WaMu) and  induce variability in bank operations. Moreover, 
6:222:17454:17:17:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistent implementation may potentially reduce the transparency of bank balance-sheets for 
6:223:17549:17:18:72:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:agents in the economy who are unaware of the source of this variability, as the exact alternation 
6:224:17647:18:17:72:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:schedule of regulators for each bank is not known to the public. As shown in Caballero, Hoshi, 
6:225:17742:17:17:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Kashyap (2008), lack of timeliness of corrective banking actions as well as opaque balance-
6:226:17837:17:17:72:544:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:sheet  information  can  be  costly  and  can  adversely  impact  real  allocations.  Importantly,  these  
6:227:17944:17:18:72:542:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:adverse effects are present in our sample regardless of whether the inconsistency between federal 
6:228:18042:18:17:72:545:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  state  regulators  is  a  result  of  deliberate  design  or  an  unplanned  feature  of  the  current  
6:229:18151:17:0:72:547:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  structure.  In  other  words,  delays  in  taking  corrective  action  and  reduction  in  
7:230:18257:0:17:72:542:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:transparency of balance-sheets can be costly whether, loosely speaking, a possible "bad cop/good 
7:231:18354:17:17:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:cop" implicit arrangement between federal and state regulators we uncover is intended or not.5

7:233:18451:17:18:71:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our work is broadly related to several strands of the economics and finance literature. First, it is 
7:234:18552:18:17:71:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:most  directly  related  to  work  on  regulatory  design.  The  issue  of  the  design  of  regulation  spans  
7:235:18664:17:17:71:544:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:from its early public interest roots to the Chicago theory of Stigler (1971) and Peltzman (1976), 
7:236:18762:17:17:71:546:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:who  argued  that  regulation  is  often  captured  by  the  industry  it  is  meant  to  regulate  and  is  
7:237:18871:17:18:71:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:designed primarily for insiders’ benefit, to the rent seeking theory of regulation (e.g. Shleifer and

7:239:19082:17:17:72:546:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:cons  of  different  regulatory  structures,  but  provides  surprisingly  little  systematic  empirical  
7:240:19188:17:17:72:548:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence.   Our   work   contributes   to   this   literature   by   highlighting   systematic   regulatory   
7:241:19298:17:18:72:501:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:inconsistencies and tracing their consequences – that is, their effects on banks' behavior.

7:243:19391:17:17:72:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:Second,  and  more  relevant  to  the  issue  of  regulatory  inconsistencies,  this  paper  speaks  to  a  
7:244:19499:17:17:72:546:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively  established  literature  (mostly  concerning  industrial  organization)  that  focuses  on  
7:245:19603:17:18:72:545:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  consistency  and  regulatory  uncertainty.7  Not  unlike  our  paper,  this  literature  also  
7:246:19710:18:17:72:546:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies  some  sources  of  regulatory  inconsistencies  (e.g.  elected  versus  appointed  regulators  
7:247:19814:17:17:72:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Besley and Coate (2003)) as well as their consequences (e.g. differential firm productivity).   
7:248:19911:17:17:72:75:416:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
7:249:19911:17:18:72:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:Third,  this  paper  is  connected  to  studies  on  regulatory  arbitrage  (Rosen,  2003;  Rosen,  2005;  
7:250:20018:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rezende, 2011) that suggests that banks actively shop for regulators who are likely to be softer 
7:251:20115:17:17:72:547:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  them  through  different  channels  such  as  charter  changes,  mergers  with  other  banks,  
7:252:20214:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisory  ratings,  or  changing  their  location  of  incorporation.  Other  work  in  this  area  (Kane,  
7:253:20325:17:18:72:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000; Calomiris, 2006) also discusses changes in regulatory standards (constituting a "race to the 
7:254:20424:18:17:72:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:bottom")  due  to  competition  between  regulators  (on  account  of  "regulator  shopping"  by  those  
7:255:20529:17:17:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulated).  In  general,  this  arbitraging  behavior  by  banks  may  induce  a  potentially  sizeable  
7:256:20635:17:17:72:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:selection  bias  in  examining  the  effects  of  regulatory  actions.  Our  empirical  design  circumvents  
7:257:20744:17:22:72:413:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:this issue and provides causal estimates of the influence of regulators.8

7:259:20877:7:17:72:537:232:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 The Riegle Act was predominantly motivated by red tape reduction, in no part of its text does it appear focused on 
7:260:20994:17:11:72:527:215:100:Times:100:Times:F:the creation of a deliberate optimal mix of more and less lenient regulators. Our personal discussion of the matter 
7:261:21110:11:11:72:500:204:100:Times:100:Times:F:with several supervision and regulation experts also appears to strongly support the view that this is not an 
7:262:21220:11:12:72:533:193:100:Times:100:Times:F:aforethought feature of the regulatory structure. In addition, to the best of these practitioners’ knowledge, although 
7:263:21339:12:11:72:537:181:100:Times:100:Times:F:inconsistent implementation conforms to their priors, no specific gain (e.g. extra information conceded by the bank) 
7:264:21456:11:7:72:497:170:100:Times:100:Times:F:is commonly recognized as originating from such out-of-step behavior of the federal and state regulators.  
7:265:21563:7:17:72:533:163:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 The public interest roots go back as far as Pigou (1938). For a comprehensive review of the public interest theory 
7:266:21680:17:11:71:505:146:100:Times:100:Times:F:see Laffont and Tirole (1993), which also focuses on a modern take on regulation, encompassing the role of 
7:267:21787:11:11:71:540:135:100:Times:100:Times:F:asymmetric information. Also related is the work on banking regulation by Dewatripont and Tirole (1994); Boot and 
7:268:21901:11:12:71:507:124:100:Times:100:Times:F:Thakor (1993); and Hellman, Murdock and Stiglitz (2000) among the others. The issue of centralized versus 
7:269:22007:12:11:71:534:112:100:Times:100:Times:F:decentralized regulation, often discussing state versus federal regulation in the US context, has received theoretical 
7:270:22126:11:7:71:518:101:100:Times:100:Times:F:attention in Martimort (1999), Laffont and Martimort (1999), and Laffont and Pouyet (2004) among the others. 
7:271:22235:7:12:72:445:94:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 See Brennan and Schwartz (1982a, b); Viscusi (1983); Prager (1989); and Teisberg (1993). 
7:272:22326:12:17:72:516:82:42:g_d0_f6:100:Times:F:8 The literature on regulatory shopping and a race to the bottom extends beyond banking. For instance, there is 
7:273:22438:17:11:72:524:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:literature on international trade that provides evidence that firms shop for the least stringent regulator. Similarly, 
7:274:22557:11:12:72:529:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:there is a growing literature on shopping of rating agencies by issuers of mortgage backed securities (e.g., Bolton, 
7:275:22674:12:0:72:184:42:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:F:Frexias and Shapiro, 2011).

8:277:22705:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, our work complements the empirical literature on the effects of banking regulation and 
8:278:22801:17:17:72:539:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervision.  Such  work  encompasses  studies  on  the  role  of  regulation  and  supervision  in  well-
8:279:22907:17:18:72:544:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:established banking and financial sectors of developed economies (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996; 
8:280:23002:18:17:72:545:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Berger  and  Hannan,  1998;  Kroszner  and  Strahan,  1999),  as  well  as  in  developing  financial  
8:281:23105:17:17:72:198:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:sectors across the globe.9

8:283:23133:17:18:71:545:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we  discuss  the  structure  of  US  
8:284:23243:18:17:72:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:banking supervision and the data. Then, in Section 3, we highlight our empirical strategy. Next, 
8:285:23340:17:17:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  Section  4,  we  report  our  main  results  and  robustness  checks.  In  Section  5,  we  explore  the  
8:286:23450:17:17:72:547:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely  sources  of  the  differences  in  regulatory   behavior   reported.   We   discuss   the   wider

8:291:23685:17:18:72:297:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1 An Overview of US Banking Regulation 
8:292:23726:18:17:72:545:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  US  banking  industry  has  evolved  into  a  complex  and  fragmented  system  that  reflects  
8:293:23827:17:17:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:America's  historical  tension  between  centralizing  and  decentralizing  political  forces.  Since  the  
8:294:23935:17:17:72:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:National Bank Act of 1863, commercial banks have had to deal with a dual supervisory system, 
8:295:24028:17:18:72:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:under  which  they  are  chartered  and  supervised  both  by  federal  and  state-level  entities.10  This  
8:296:24137:18:17:71:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:system has often been praised by policymakers as playing a key role in financial innovation, as 
8:297:24233:17:17:71:544:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  and  state  regulating  bodies  compete  with  one  another  and  thus  trim  unnecessary  rules  
8:298:24340:17:17:71:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Scott, 1977). In addition, commentators have argued that state regulators can leverage their local 
8:299:24440:17:18:71:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge  to  improve  their  supervisory  decisions.  At  the  same  time  several  policy  makers  and  
8:300:24547:18:17:71:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:commentators  have  criticized  the  dual  system  for  the  resulting  fragmentation  of  the  banking  
8:301:24652:17:17:71:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:sector  and  for  the  risk  of  a  “competition  for  laxity”  generated  among  bank  regulators  (for  
8:302:24758:17:17:71:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:example  Fed  Chairman  Arthur  Burns,  1974).  This  latter  issue  has  been  actively  debated  in  the  
8:303:24866:17:18:71:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:past  –most  recently  around  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act  of  1999–  and  has  again  resurfaced  in  
8:304:24971:18:17:71:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  aftermath  of  the  2008-09  crisis  (see  Senator  Dodd’s  speech  in  Senate  Banking  Committee  
8:305:25076:17:17:71:214:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:hearing in September, 2009).

8:307:25105:17:18:71:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the current system banks can choose between a state and national charter. With a state charter, 
8:308:25204:18:17:71:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:they  can  also  decide  whether  or  not  to  be  members  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System.  The  three  
8:309:25312:17:17:71:547:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:different  types  of  commercial  bank  charters  correspond  to  three  different  primary  federal  
8:310:25414:17:17:71:543:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), instituted in 1863; the Federal

8:312:25571:7:12:72:458:116:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 The literature on the latter is vast. See Beck et al. (2000); Barth et al. (2004) among the others. 
8:313:25673:12:16:72:538:104:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Prior to 1863 state commercial banking was the primary form of banking. Commercial banks are the predominant 
8:314:25785:16:11:71:527:88:100:Times:100:Times:F:form of depository institutions in the United States and are the focus of this paper.  The other two main classes of 
8:315:25902:11:12:71:510:77:100:Times:100:Times:F:depository institutions are savings banks (also known as thrifts because they historically offered only savings 
8:316:26014:12:11:71:509:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:accounts), which generally specialize in real estate lending and credit unions which are cooperative financial 
8:317:26125:11:12:71:536:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:institutions. Among other types of depository institutions in the United States are the following: Edge corporations, 
8:318:26243:12:0:71:303:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:branches and the branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
9:319:26303:0:17:72:546:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC),  instituted  in  1933;  and  the  Federal  Reserve  System  
9:320:26404:17:17:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Fed),  instituted  in  1913.  Federally  chartered  banks,  also  known  as  national  banks  (NA)  are  
9:321:26510:17:17:72:544:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:primarily supervised (and chartered) by the OCC. State banks are supervised by their chartering 
9:322:26606:17:18:72:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:state banking departments, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, if they are members of the 
9:323:26701:18:17:72:542:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Federal Reserve System (as we stated before, these banks are called state-member banks, SMBs). 
9:324:26796:17:17:72:544:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:Otherwise,  state  banks  are  supervised  by  their  respective  chartering  state  banking  departments  
9:325:26903:17:17:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:along  with  the  FDIC,  since  these  banks  are  not  a  member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  (i.e.,  
9:326:27013:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:these banks are referred to as non-member banks, NMBs as we explained earlier). In general, the 
9:327:27109:18:17:72:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulator that is in charge of regulating and supervising an entity is also a function of its line of 
9:328:27211:17:17:72:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:business.  Figure  1  depicts  the  structure  of  supervision  and  regulation  for  US  commercial  banks  
9:329:27320:17:17:72:127:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:and thrifts. 
9:330:27333:17:18:72:75:537:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
9:331:27333:18:17:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:Until  recently  different  charters  implied  notable  differences  in  permissible  activities  as  well  as  
9:332:27445:17:17:72:546:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  requirements.  For  example,  through  the  early  1980s  non-member  banks  were  not  
9:333:27545:17:17:72:546:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:subject  to  reserve  requirements  (according  to  the  Depository  Institutions  Deregulation  and  
9:334:27647:17:18:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:Monetary Control Act of 1980), their lending limits could differ significantly across states, their 
9:335:27747:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability to branch interstate differed, and the list of activities (e.g. providing insurance) that they 
9:336:27850:17:17:72:546:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:were  permitted  was  quite  diverse.  However,  over  the  years,  many  of  the  differences  across  
9:337:27954:17:17:72:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirements  and  charters  have  disappeared  as  regulatory  and  charters  have  converged.  Many  
9:338:28057:17:18:72:543:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:commentators believe that the main drivers of charter choice now are direct regulatory costs and 
9:339:28154:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:the bank’s perception of the regulator’s accessibility.11 Small banks tend to prefer state charters, 
9:340:28255:17:17:72:544:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  applications  are  streamlined  and  supervisory  fees  are  lower  (Blair  and  Kushmeider  (2006)).  
9:341:28362:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:Larger  banks,  especially  those  that  aim  at  branching  inter-state,  tend  to  prefer  national  charters  
9:342:28475:17:18:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:(see,  e.g.,  Bierce  (2007)).12  As  of  the  first  quarter  of  2011,  about  1,350  NAs  accounted  for  70  
9:343:28588:18:17:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent  of  all  commercial  bank  assets;  about  800  SMBs  accounted  for  about  15  percent  of  all  
9:344:28696:17:17:72:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks assets, and around 4,200 NMBs accounted for the remaining 15 percent of all assets.

9:346:28786:17:18:71:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:Banking  micro-prudential  supervision  in  the  United  States  relies  on  two  main  pillars:  off-  and  
9:347:28895:18:17:71:546:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:on-site  monitoring.  Off-site  monitoring  requires  all  depository  institutions  to  file  quarterly  
9:348:29001:17:17:72:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:“Reports  of  Condition  and  Income”,  or  Call  Reports.  Regulators  use  Call  Reports  to  monitor  a  
9:349:29109:17:17:71:546:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank’s  financial  conditions  between  on-site  examinations.  On-site  “safety  and  soundness”  
9:350:29208:17:18:71:545:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:examinations  are  used  to  verify  the  content  of  Call  Reports  and  to  gather  additional  in-depth

10:362:30306:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:discuss  with  management  the  need  for  informal  or formal supervisory actions. Informal actions 
10:363:30407:17:17:72:544:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  established  through  a  commitment  from  the  bank  to  solve  the  deficiencies  identified  in  the

10:365:30622:18:17:71:548:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:severe.   They   include   cease-and-desist   orders,   suspensions   or   removals   of   banks’   senior

10:388:32463:17:17:72:545:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:threshold  has  changed  over  time  and  since  2007  stands  at  $500  million  for  SMBs  and  NMBs

10:391:32769:18:17:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 required the Federal 
10:392:32858:17:17:72:546:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:Financial  Institutions  Examination  Council  (FFIEC)  to  issue  guidelines  for  determining  the

11:404:33889:17:17:72:544:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:FFIEC  rules  were  issued,  federal  and  state  regulators  could  take  turns  every  12  months  (or  18

11:407:34058:17:17:72:546:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:As  noted  previously,  the  FFIEC  rules  established  that  each  federal  regulator  independently  
11:408:34161:17:17:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:determines whether to accept the state examination results based on the type of reports produced 
11:409:34258:17:18:72:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:by  the  state  examiners,  as  well  as  measures  of  minimum  state  banking  department  budgets  and

11:412:34580:17:17:71:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:already entered into informal and formal arrangements, or working agreements, with most state 
11:413:34674:17:18:71:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:banking  departments,  determining  the  types  of  banks  that  would  be  examined  on  an  alternating  
11:414:34781:18:17:71:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:independent basis or on a joint examination  basis,  among  other  matters.15  While  our  results  are  
11:415:34886:17:17:72:544:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:quite  insensitive  to  the  choice  of  the  starting  period  after  the  FFIEC  guidelines  of  1995  were  
11:416:34997:17:17:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:issued, we do lack a precise date on which the policy starts operating. We conservatively allow 
11:417:35093:17:18:71:547:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:for  a  one  year  breaking-in  period  and  begin  our  analysis  as  of  1996:Q1  to  ensure  that  
11:418:35195:18:17:71:545:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:idiosyncrasies  in  initial  program  implementation  would  disappear  (e.g.,  the  federal  regulators  
11:419:35301:17:17:71:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:could  have  preferred  to  let  stronger  banks  start  the  rotation  program  first,  allowing  less  robust  
11:420:35414:17:17:71:542:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions to join the rotation program later on). By 1996:Q1 rotations of supervisors across the 
11:421:35514:17:18:71:452:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:vast majority of states are pervasive in the data. Our sample ends in 2011:Q1.

11:423:35595:17:17:71:542:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:Alternating examinations are not available for a subsample of banks. Only banks that at the most

11:425:35785:17:18:71:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the alternating program. Only SMBs with an asset size of less than $10 billion are part of the 
11:426:35883:18:17:71:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:program.  In  our  sample  of  analysis,  we  focus  on  SMBs  satisfying  these  criteria,  since  only  for  
11:427:35994:17:17:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:such  banks  is  the  supervisory  rotation  policy  predetermined.  The  FDIC  conducts  alternating  
11:428:36097:17:17:71:545:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:independent  exams  only  for  NMBs  with  an  asset  size  of  less  than  $250  million,  representing  
11:429:36203:17:18:71:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than 80 percent of all NMBs. Bank examinations of larger NMBs are run on a joint basis 
11:430:36295:18:17:72:539:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the state examiner—in such cases, a mix of state and FDIC examiners participates in the on-
11:431:36391:17:17:72:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:site visits. However, even in the case of joint NMB examinations, only one agency is the “lead 
11:432:36486:17:17:72:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:agency” in assigning the CAMELS. We include such joint examinations in our sample, but our 
11:433:36577:17:18:72:394:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:results are unaffected when excluding NMBs above $250 million.

11:436:36701:8:16:72:520:127:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 These rules are summarized in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2002) and  Board of Governors of the

11:438:36886:7:16:72:532:104:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 Formal agreement dates by states are staggered over our sample period. According to Federal Deposit Insurance 
11:439:36999:16:11:72:510:88:100:Times:100:Times:F:Corporation (2004), all state banking departments with the exception of seven had signed formal cooperative 
11:440:37107:11:12:72:541:77:100:Times:100:Times:F:agreements by 2004, with the number falling to four by 2007. In 2004, the state banking departments without formal 
11:441:37222:12:11:72:542:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:agreements with federal regulators were in Alaska, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota, 
11:442:37333:11:12:72:521:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:and South Carolina. See http://www.csbs.org/development/accreditation/Pages/default.aspx .  See also Rezende

12:444:37471:0:17:72:544:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  further  filter  the  sample  by  excluding:  targeted  examinations  as  well  as  exams  where  all  
12:445:37578:17:17:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:subcomponents of the CAMELS rating are not scored or available. We also exclude concurrent 
12:446:37669:17:17:72:544:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:examinations  because  of  their  exceptional  nature  relative  to  the  routine  safety  and  soundness  
12:447:37776:17:18:72:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:examinations which are our focus. Even when meeting all the preceding criteria for inclusion in 
12:448:37872:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:our alternating supervision sample, we observe a small fraction (about 10 percent) of banks that 
12:449:37969:17:17:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not display any rotation during our sample period. These banks with no signs of supervision 
12:450:38064:17:17:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:rotation do not show up systematically within the sample—and they are spread out across states 
12:451:38159:17:18:72:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  over  time.  These  banks  appear  to  be  mostly  certain  types  of  depository  institutions  with  
12:452:38267:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:peculiar purposes (e.g. Industrial Loan Companies (ILCs)) or de novo banks.  Since these banks 
12:453:38362:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not satisfy our condition for identification that requires exogenous rotation of regulators, we 
12:454:38461:17:17:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:exclude  them  from  our  sample.  We  note,  however,  that  our  results  are  unaffected  by  including  
12:455:38569:17:18:71:246:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:these specific banks in our analysis.

12:466:39467:17:17:71:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:papers that have explored the determinants of supervisory ratings at the bank holding level (e.g. 
12:467:39565:17:18:71:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:Berger, Davies and Flannery, 1998), we employ the ratings at the level of the commercial bank, 
12:468:39660:18:17:71:406:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:which is the entity level at which we observe the examiner rotations.

12:470:39731:17:17:71:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  merge  this  information  with  balance  sheet  measures  of  bank  profitability,  profitability  and  
12:471:39839:17:18:71:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:asset  quality  from  Call  Reports.  Our  main  Call  Reports  variables  are:  Tier1  risk-based  capital  
12:472:39948:18:17:71:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratio,  leverage  ratio  (Tier1  capital  as  a  share  of  total  risk-unweighted  assets),  return  on  assets,  
12:473:40063:17:17:72:548:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:share  of  non-performing  loans  to  total  loans,  and  the  delinquency  rate  of  the  loan  portfolio.    
12:474:40174:17:17:71:547:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:Delinquent   loans   include   loans   30+   days   past   due   and   loans   in   nonaccrual   status,   and   
12:475:40287:17:18:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:nonperforming loans are 90+ delinquent and loans in nonaccrual status. In some of our analysis 
12:476:40382:18:17:71:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  will  also  dissect  delinquency  and  nonperforming  loans  for  various  asset  classes  in  a  bank’s  
12:477:40492:17:17:71:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolio  (e.g.,  commercial  real  estate,  residential  real  estate,  and  commercial  and  industrial  
12:478:40600:17:17:71:106:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans).

12:480:40608:18:17:71:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:Importantly for our analysis, we define a supervisory cycle as the time between when a regulator 
12:481:40705:17:17:71:544:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducts  its  on-site  examination  and  when  the  alternate  regulator  examines  the  bank,  with  the  
12:482:40813:17:17:71:543:71:144:Times:144:Times:B:time  period  lasting  either  12  or  18  months  depending  on  the  bank’s  asset  size  (as  discussed  in  
12:483:40925:17:0:71:543:54:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 2.2). In our regressions, we use this definition to assess the relationship between changes 
13:484:41029:0:17:72:544:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  supervisor  identity  and  CAMELS  ratings  as  well  as  bank  variables.  Because  the  CAMELS  
13:485:41131:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:rating does not change between exams, doing so captures how supervisory rating changes across 
13:486:41225:17:17:72:543:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:different  regulators.  Bank  balance  sheet  variables,  instead,  can  vary  each  quarter.  This  implies  
13:487:41335:17:18:72:544:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  using  our  definition  of  supervisory  cycle  in  this  analysis  compares  the  average  effect  on  a  
13:488:41448:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable  across  quarters  following  a  federal  or  a  state  examination.  We  revert  to  this  issue  in  
13:489:41560:17:17:72:132:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 4.2.

13:491:41573:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:Summary statistics for our sample of rotating banks as of 1996:Q1 appear in Table 1. We present 
13:492:41669:18:17:72:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  descriptive  statistics  on  CAMELS  ratings,  as  well  as  bank  balance-sheet  measures  such  as  
13:493:41776:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:delinquencies,  non-performing  loans,  and  ROA  for  both  SMBs  and  NMBs  split  up  by  whether  
13:494:41878:17:17:72:545:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:they  were  assigned  to  federal  or  state  regulators  at  the  start  of  our  sample.  These  statistics  
13:495:41989:17:18:72:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:provide  sample  moments  that  will  be  useful  for  interpreting  the  magnitude  of  our  regression  
13:496:42095:18:17:72:134:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients. 
13:497:42109:17:17:72:75:502:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
13:498:42109:17:17:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:We provide the length of duration between supervisory rotations in Table 2. A vast majority of 
13:499:42204:17:18:72:544:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks  display  supervisory  rotations  between  two  and  eight  quarters.  This  description  matches  
13:500:42309:18:17:72:546:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:well  the  regulatory  restriction  of  four-quarter  to  six-quarter  rotations  discussed  earlier.  In  
13:501:42416:17:17:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular,  NMBs  are  subject  to  less  frequent  examinations  and  rotations,  about  one  every  18  
13:502:42523:17:17:71:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:months. This is in line with the guidelines discussed earlier since NMBs tend to be smaller banks 
13:503:42621:17:18:72:543:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:(mean  assets  size  of  NMBs  in  our  sample  in  1996:Q1  is  $95  million).  Being  larger,  SMBs  are  
13:504:42729:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:subject to standard 12-month rotations in most cases (mean assets size of SMBs in our sample in 
13:505:42825:17:17:72:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:1996:Q1 is $160 million). We investigate the reasons for shorter rotation spells and find that they 
13:506:42925:17:17:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:are mostly accounted for by institutions that exit our sample because of the large wave of bank 
13:507:43021:17:18:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:mergers that occurred over the past 15 years. The relaxation of intrastate and interstate branching 
13:508:43121:18:17:72:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulation  (culminating  in  the  Riegle-Neal  Act  of  1994)  and  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act  of  
13:509:43224:17:17:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999 were primary facilitators of this M&A wave, a trend that we find is unrelated to the timing 
13:510:43321:17:17:71:244:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the supervisory rotation cycle.16  
13:511:43359:17:18:72:75:261:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
13:512:43359:18:17:72:545:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:Regulation  spells  may  also  be  shorter  because  of  banks  switching  charters  or  relocating  their  
13:513:43467:17:17:72:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:operations  (Rosen  (2005)).  These  instances  are  fairly  limited  in  the  data,  and  similar  to  M&A  
13:514:43576:17:17:72:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:activity, we find relocations and charter switches to be unrelated to the timing or identity of the 
13:515:43676:17:18:72:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisor  in    rotation  cycles.  We  also  occasionally  find  idiosyncratic  cases  of  longer  rotation  
13:516:43787:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:cycles,  but  their  exclusion  does  not  affect  our  results  in  any  substantive  way.  Discussions  with  
13:517:43899:17:17:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:senior executives in supervision and regulation suggested that most of these idiosyncrasies might 
13:518:43997:17:28:72:545:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:be  due  to  staffing  issues,  both  at  the  state  and  federal  level.17  Often  a  longer-than-expected  
13:519:44107:28:8:72:218:112:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
13:520:44167:8:16:72:527:104:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 Prior research has investigated the reasons for this trend and found it to be reflective of the weakening of small 
13:521:44285:16:11:71:527:88:100:Times:100:Times:F:bank special interests vis-à-vis large banks in light of the introduction of new technologies in lending and deposit-
13:522:44402:11:7:71:344:77:100:Times:100:Times:F:taking. For a complete discussion see Kroszner and Strahan (1999). 
13:523:44469:7:16:72:512:70:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 Examples included instances when the examiner assigned to a specific bank was on leave or vacation at the 
13:524:44578:16:12:71:529:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:predetermined exam time and when the assigned examiner was still involved with on-site examinations at another 
13:525:44689:12:0:71:117:42:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:F:institution. 
14:526:44706:0:17:72:544:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:rotation  time  with  one  regulator  would  be  offset  by  a  subsequent  shorter  rotation  time  with  the  
14:527:44818:17:17:72:546:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternating  regulator;  this  tendency  to  rebalance  the  rotation  times  would  be  in  line  with  
14:528:44923:17:17:72:544:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  restrictions.  Figure  2  reports  the  kernel  densities  of  the  rotation  spells  graphically,  
14:529:45035:17:18:72:546:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:illustrating  compliance  to  the  rotation  profiles  required  by  law  for  SMBs  and  NMBs.    Our  
14:530:45139:18:17:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:interviews with experts in banking supervision and regulation confirmed a strict implementation 
14:531:45235:17:17:72:342:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the rotation policy that is consistent with this pattern. 
14:532:45296:17:17:72:75:623:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
14:533:45296:17:18:72:544:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally,  Table  1  also  allows  us  to  investigate  the  nature  of  assignment  of  banks  to  state  versus  
14:534:45410:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal regulators at the inception of the rotation policy. It reports t-tests for differences in means 
14:535:45514:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:across federally and state regulated banks involved in the rotation process as of the first quarter 
14:536:45614:17:17:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  1996.  Broadly,  we  find  that  banks  assigned  to  state  regulators  versus  federal  look  similar  in  
14:537:45727:17:18:72:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  cross-section  at  inception.  We  fail  to  reject  equality  of  means  in  the  vast  majority  of  the  
14:538:45840:18:17:72:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlling  variables.  Occasionally,  Table  1  reports  some  differences  along  certain  dimensions,  
14:539:45947:17:17:72:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicating potential deviations from pure random assignment. In the SMB sample, we reject the 
14:540:46041:17:17:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:equality of means for ROA alone; in the NMB sample we reject the null of equality of means for 
14:541:46136:17:18:72:545:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:nonperforming  loans,  delinquency  rates,  and  leverage.  These  cross-sectional  differences  are,  
14:542:46239:18:17:72:545:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:however,  quantitatively  small.  Figures  3  and  4  plot  the  kernel  densities  for  characteristics  of  
14:543:46349:17:17:72:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks assigned to federal and state supervisors as of 1996:Q1 and confirm this to be the case –
14:544:46444:17:17:72:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  difference  in  the  two  densities  are  barely  noticeable  along  any  dimension.  We  find  similar  
14:545:46554:17:18:72:546:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence  after  exploring  successive  dates  right  after  1996:Q1  as  well.  No  variable  displays  
14:546:46659:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematic consistent breaks across banks assigned to federal versus state regulators. We do not 
14:547:46756:17:17:72:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:report these results for brevity's sake. As we will elaborate in the next section, our identification 
14:548:46858:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategy relies on predetermined within-bank variation  of  regulators  and  not  on  which  regulator  
14:549:46962:17:18:72:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:was assigned at the inception of the rotation policy. Nevertheless, the quasi-randomized nature of 
14:550:47061:18:17:72:514:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:assignment of initial supervisors across banks lends further support to our empirical design.

15:588:49366:18:17:72:543:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:bias in empirical contract theory, as for instance studied by Ackerberg and Botticini (2002).18 In 
15:589:49465:17:17:71:539:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical  matching  models  that  achieve  identification,  one  needs  to  account  for  the  principal-

15:603:50333:8:16:72:540:81:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 A main difference in our paper is our focus on selection issues arising both in changes and in levels, as opposed to 
15:604:50453:16:11:71:535:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:selection arising in levels only. This excludes the possibility of using panel variation as a source of identification in

18:687:56351:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 4 we need to account for the high persistence of the CAMELS ratings. CAMELS ratings do 
18:688:56442:17:17:72:542:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:not vary frequently for a bank and rating changes most likely incorporate substantial information.

18:692:56839:17:17:72:540:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular, the effect of a switch from a state regulator to the Fed is about a third of the within-
18:693:56939:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:SMB standard deviation. Similarly, the switch from a state regulator to the FDIC results in about 
18:694:57037:18:17:71:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  fifth  of  the  within-NMB  standard  deviation.  The  impact  of  switching  to  a  federal  regulator  is

18:697:57242:17:18:71:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:Another (more intuitive) way of displaying the magnitudes of the results in Tables 3 and 4 is to 
18:698:57339:18:17:71:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyze  simple  raw  frequencies  of  changes  in  CAMELS  ratings  around  the  rotation.  In  other  
18:699:57443:17:17:71:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:words, conditional on observing a change in the CAMELS rating—in essentially all cases equal 
18:700:57536:17:17:71:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:to one notch in magnitude in our data—we  can ask which agency is more likely to downgrade 
18:701:57627:17:18:71:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i.e., reporting a CAMELS increase) or upgrade (i.e., reporting a CAMELS drop). The results of 
18:702:57722:18:17:71:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:this simple tabulation exercise are reported in Table 5 for both SMBs and NMBs. The difference 
18:703:57817:17:17:71:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:between  state  and  federal  regulators  is  striking.  Both  Fed  and  FDIC  are  about  twice  as  more  
18:704:57925:17:17:71:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely  than  their  state  counterparts  to  downgrade  a  commercial  bank.  For  SMBs,  76  percent  of  
18:705:58033:17:18:71:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:the downgrades originate from the Fed and only 24 percent from the state regulator. For NMBs, 
18:706:58127:18:17:71:546:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:65  percent  of  the  downgrades  originate  from  the  FDIC  and  only  35  percent  from  the  state  
18:707:58231:17:17:71:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulator.  Notably,  the  Fed  is  also  less  likely  to  upgrade  relative  to  the  average  state  regulator  
18:708:58346:17:17:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:(only  43  percent  of  SMB  upgrades  are  Fed-originated),  although  the  FDIC  is  more  likely  to  
18:709:58451:17:18:72:545:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:upgrade  than  the  state  regulator  (58  percent  of  NMB  upgrades  are  FDIC-originated).  Hence,  
18:710:58554:18:17:72:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:while the Fed appears unambiguously more stringent than its average state counterpart, the FDIC 
18:711:58650:17:17:72:304:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:displays more stringency in downgrading only.  
18:712:58697:17:17:72:75:278:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
18:713:58697:17:18:72:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  addition,  state  regulators  do  not  appear  to  completely  counteract  federal  regulators'  activity.  
18:714:58809:18:17:71:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  frequency  of  federal  regulators'  downgrades  is  substantially  higher  than  the  frequency  of  
18:715:58916:17:17:71:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:state  regulators'  upgrades.  Raw  frequencies  indicate  that  state  regulators'  assessments  appear  to  
18:716:59026:17:17:71:546:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:mostly  stabilize  around  federal  regulators'  assessments  instead.  Finally,  federal  regulators  
18:717:59129:17:18:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistently display: a) a similar degree of stringency across all subcomponents of the CAMELS 
18:718:59224:18:17:71:544:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratings,  as  reported  in  Appendix  Table  2;  b)  no  differential  behavior  for  banks  that  eventually  
18:719:59335:17:17:72:544:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:end  up  in  the  problem  bank  list  (defined  as  banks  with  CAMELS  ratings  of  4  or  5);  and  c)  no  
18:720:59447:17:17:72:544:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:evident  difference  in  stringency  as  a  function  of  the  final  CAMELS  rating  (not  reported  for  
18:721:59554:17:23:72:158:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:brevity's sake).19

18:723:59634:7:16:72:500:93:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 Appendix Table 3 reports the same decomposition of CAMELS rating increases (bank downgrades) and 
18:724:59734:16:12:71:520:77:100:Times:100:Times:F:CAMELS rating increases (bank upgrades) as Table 5, but limited to banks that end up in the future as problem 
18:725:59844:12:11:71:535:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:banks. State regulators are only slightly more likely to downgrade a problem bank (29 percent for SMB, 38 percent 
18:726:59958:11:12:71:527:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:for NMB) relative to what they do in the case of the average bank in Table 5 (24 percent for SMB, 35 percent for 
18:727:60071:12:0:71:212:42:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:F:NMB) vis-à-vis federal regulators.

19:729:60110:17:17:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  confirm  that  the  results  of  simple  tabulations  in  Table  5  are  statistically  significant  and  
19:730:60220:17:17:72:545:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:robust  by  employing  specifications  that  condition  on  bank  and  quarter  fixed  effects.  Table  6  
19:731:60327:17:18:72:546:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:presents  results  from  a  linear  probability  model  where  the  dependent  variable  is  1  for  a  
19:732:60431:18:17:71:542:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:CAMELS rating decrease and 0 otherwise in columns (1) and (2) and the dependent variable is 1 
19:733:60525:17:17:71:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:for a CAMELS rating increase and 0 otherwise in columns (3) and (4). The higher propensity of 
19:734:60619:17:17:71:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:a downgrade to originate from a federal regulator is robust to the inclusion of bank and quarter 
19:735:60716:17:18:71:542:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects and very precisely estimated. With the admitted caveat of a large frequency of zeros 
19:736:60815:18:17:71:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  these  regressions  (due  to  the  serial  correlation  in  the  CAMELS  ratings  discussion  earlier),  
19:737:60924:17:17:71:545:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:magnitudes  in  these  specifications  suggest  effects  of  the  order  of  10-25  percent  within-bank  
19:738:61030:17:17:72:528:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard deviations. In contrast, the propensities to upgrade are an order of magnitude smaller. 
19:739:61127:17:18:72:75:537:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
19:740:61127:18:17:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:A  final  caveat  is  in  order.  Regressions  involving  regulatory  outcomes,  such  as  the  CAMELS  
19:741:61231:17:17:72:546:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:rating  regressions  presented  in  this  section,  could  potentially  suffer  from  the  omission  of  
19:742:61336:17:17:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:dynamic  interactions  between  regulators.  Our  estimates  could  be  affected  by  the  omission  of  
19:743:61441:17:18:72:545:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectations  of  federal  regulators  about  subsequent  behavior  of  state  regulators.  For  instance,  
19:744:61549:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators  could  decide  to  preemptively  downgrade  the  rating  in  expectation  of  a  more  
19:745:61657:17:17:72:544:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:lenient  future  cycle  under  state  regulators,  even  if  conditions  do  not  warrant  it  yet.  No  direct  
19:746:61770:17:17:72:546:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence  of  dynamic  interaction  appeared  obvious  in  our  extensive  checks  in  the  data.  For  
19:747:61874:17:18:72:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:example,  a  downgrade  by  a  federal  regulator  did  not  appear  to  predict  either  an  upgrade  or  a  
19:748:61984:18:17:72:545:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:downgrade  by  the  state  supervisor  in  charge  of  the  following  examination  cycle.  While  our  
19:749:62088:17:17:72:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:choice  of  exclusion  of  future/alternative regulators’ characteristics from equation (1) was based 
19:750:62190:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:on such evidence, it is, however, important to discuss the likely econometric issues arising from 
19:751:62288:17:18:72:544:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:such  an  omission.  Under  a  more  general  statistical  model  where  these  dynamic  effects  were  at  
19:752:62396:18:18:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:play,  the  structural  parameter  vector  of  interest  [1,]  in  (2)  would  be  consistently  recoverable  
19:753:62508:18:17:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the data only if information on the exact nature of the dynamic interaction across regulators 
19:754:62607:17:17:72:543:277:144:Times:144:Times:B:became  available.  Nonetheless,  absent  such  information,  the  estimated  coefficients  on  b1  and  s 
19:755:62713:17:18:72:546:260:144:Times:144:Times:B:would  still  represent  consistent  reduced-form  equilibrium  effects  of  bank  behavior  and  the  
19:756:62816:18:17:72:416:242:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisor’s identity. We limit ourselves to such an interpretation here. 
19:757:62890:17:17:72:75:225:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
19:758:62890:17:17:72:291:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2 Do Supervisors Affect Bank Behavior? 
19:759:62930:17:18:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:Are changes in the identity of a regulator detectable along explicit dimensions of bank behavior? 
19:760:63028:18:17:72:547:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  this  section,  we  investigate  banks’  short-term  response  to  the  heightened  threat  of  a  
19:761:63131:17:17:71:542:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:downgrade stemming from a federal supervisor documented previously. This is an important step 
19:762:63225:17:17:71:544:139:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  the  assessment  of  the  potential  real  economic  consequences  of  regulatory  idiosyncrasies  on  
19:763:63332:17:18:72:544:122:144:Times:144:Times:B:overseen  entities.  We  employ  information  from  Call  Reports  to  formally  test  this  proposition  
19:764:63438:18:17:72:546:104:144:Times:144:Times:B:along  three  main  dimensions  of  bank  operations:  regulatory  capital,  profitability,  and  asset  
19:765:63543:17:17:72:114:87:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality.  
19:766:63553:17:0:72:75:70:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
20:767:63557:0:17:72:546:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:More  specifically,  we  employ  within-bank  variation  to  assess  whether  the  Fed  and  FDIC  
20:768:63656:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:effectively impose more stringent capital and liquidity conditions on depository institutions than 
20:769:63755:17:17:72:545:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  average  state  supervisor.  Our  specification  mirrors  equation  (7)  with  now  the  dependent  
20:770:63860:17:18:72:545:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:being  bank  balance  sheet  variables  rather  than  CAMELS  ratings.  As  discussed  above,  it  is  
20:771:63963:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:important  to  reiterate  that  we  define  a  supervisory  cycle  as  the  time  between  when  a  regulator  
20:772:64074:17:17:72:542:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducts its on-site examination and when the alternate regulator examines the bank. This allows 
20:773:64171:17:17:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:us  to  track  actions  undertaken  by  banks  following  the  examination.    Since  bank  variables  can  
20:774:64279:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially change every quarter, our specification now compares the average effect on a variable 
20:775:64377:18:17:72:356:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:across quarters following a federal or a state examination.  
20:776:64438:17:17:72:75:571:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
20:777:64438:17:17:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:One  may  reasonably  conjecture  that,  in  addition  to  imposing  stricter  ratings,  federal  regulators  
20:778:64548:17:18:72:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:may  impose  more  stringent  capital  allocations,  i.e.,  higher  capital  imposition  (such  as  higher  
20:779:64656:18:17:72:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tier1 RBCR) and better governance, i.e., explicit booking of past delinquent and nonperforming 
20:780:64751:17:17:72:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans, all at the expense of returns (i.e., resulting in lower ROA).20 The data support the view that 
20:781:64853:17:17:72:390:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank behavior is affected in ways consistent with this conjecture.  
20:782:64921:17:18:72:75:468:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
20:783:64921:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:Panel  A  in  Table  7  reports  empirical  evidence  for  the  SMB  sample  and  Panel  B  for  the  NMB  
20:784:65028:17:17:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample. The rotation from a state regulator to a federal regulator (Fed or FDIC) unambiguously 
20:785:65123:17:17:72:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:produces an increase in Tier1 RBCR and the regulatory leverage ratio (defined as Tier1 capital 
20:786:65218:17:18:72:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:divided  by  total  risk-unweighted  assets  in  Call  Reports),  a  drop  in  ROA,  and  an  increase  in  
20:787:65326:18:17:72:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:delinquent  and  nonperforming  loans  booked  by  the  depository  institution.  All  coefficients  of  
20:788:65431:17:17:72:548:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:interests  are  precisely  estimated,  with  the  exception  of  delinquency  rates  in  the  NMB  sample.    
20:789:65541:17:17:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:Given  the  short-term  nature  of  the  changes  due  to  the  length  of  the  rotations,  the  economic  
20:790:65649:17:18:72:545:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:magnitudes  of  these  estimates  are  reasonable  with  effects  ranging  between  3  percent  and  8  
20:791:65753:18:17:72:515:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of a within-bank standard deviation per extra quarter of federal regulator oversight.

20:793:65848:17:17:72:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:We further analyze the nature of bank asset portfolio and components of ROA that are affected 
20:794:65942:17:18:72:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the stricter governance imposed by federal regulators. In particular, in Appendix Table 4 we 
20:795:66038:18:17:72:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyze the nature of delinquencies and non-performing loans when we break the loan portfolio 
20:796:66132:17:17:72:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  banks  into  real  estate  loans  –  commercial  and  residential  –  and  commercial  and  industrial  
20:797:66240:17:17:72:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans  (C&I).  We  find  that  the  change  in  delinquency  and  non-performing  loans  documented  in  
20:798:66345:17:18:72:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 4 is mainly driven by a change in real estate loans (both commercial and residential), while 
20:799:66444:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is only limited variation in C&I loan quality around rotations. In addition, we also examine 
20:800:66543:17:17:72:544:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  components  of  ROA  that  contribute  to  its  change  in  Table  7.  We  find  that  increases  in  the  
20:801:66655:17:28:72:543:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision for loan loss and non-interest expenses largely contribute to this change.21 We interpret

20:803:66815:8:16:72:510:104:42:Times:100:Times:F:20Capital ratios can be influenced through changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses. There is a large 
20:804:66927:16:11:71:530:88:100:Times:100:Times:F:literature that documents bank discretion in booking losses on its loan portfolio and the factors that influence such 
20:805:67045:11:12:71:538:77:100:Times:100:Times:F:behavior. For instance, see Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap (2008) for Japanese banks and Kane (1989) and Kroszner 
20:806:67157:12:7:71:208:65:100:Times:100:g_d0_f3:F:and Strahan (1996) for US banks. 
20:807:67190:7:16:72:533:58:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 Salaries are the main component of non-interest expense.  An increase of salaries expenses is consistent with the

21:813:67661:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:There  is  an  important  remark  to  be  made  about  the  quantitative  interpretation  of  these  bank  
21:814:67768:17:17:72:545:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior  results.  Effects  in  Table  7  should  be  considered  downward-biased  estimates  of  the  
21:815:67872:17:17:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct effect of federal regulators on bank behavior. The reason is the nearly-deterministic nature 
21:816:67972:17:18:72:466:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the rotation rule, which allows banks to preemptively respond to changes in S.

21:818:68055:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:More formally, equation (6) which describes the effect of a supervisor on bank behavior needs to 
21:819:68152:17:17:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:also account for the expectation of future rotations. To show the exact nature of the problem, we 
21:820:68250:17:18:72:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:present a simple formalization where only the identity of the current regulator and the identity of 
21:821:68350:18:17:72:483:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:the regulator in the following examination cycle matters. In particular, let us assume:

21:826:68696:17:18:71:542:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:clearly imposes a dynamic structure not captured by (6). Making use of the condition ݏᇱൌ1െݏ,

21:833:69080:18:18:71:544:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest .  Intuitively,  anticipation  of  the  future  rotation  cycles  may  dampen  the  response  of  a

21:838:69452:17:17:71:543:223:144:Times:144:Times:B:case)  while  assuming  the  model  is  correct.  It  is  difficult,  however,  to  find  explicit  guidance  on  
21:839:69566:17:18:71:544:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  exact  nature  of  the  dynamic  response  of  a  bank  to  future  supervision,  making  results  from  
21:840:69676:18:17:71:548:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:this   exercise   model-dependent.   An   alternative,   more   reliable,   approach   is   to   limit   the   
21:841:69787:17:17:71:544:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpretation  of  the  estimated  coefficient  on  s  in  equation  (6)  to  the  reduced-form  equilibrium

21:843:69993:18:18:71:543:136:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect, such as -, and not on  directly. Importantly, given the predetermined nature of s, such 
21:844:70092:18:17:71:542:118:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduced-form coefficients remain consistently estimated even in presence of anticipatory effects.

21:846:70191:17:17:71:545:84:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  Table  8  we  further  highlight  this  point  econometrically  by  running  a  close  equivalent  to  
21:847:70298:17:18:71:543:67:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification (6’). This specification includes a dummy indicator equal to 1 if the lead agency in 
21:848:70397:18:0:71:543:49:144:Times:144:Times:B:the (current) quarter t is federal and 0 otherwise (similar to Table 7 Panel A and Panel B). More 
22:849:70499:0:17:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:importantly, these specifications also include two additional indicator variables: one that takes a 
22:850:70599:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:value  1  if  a  federal  supervisor  replaces  the  current  state  supervisor  at  quarter  t+1 (0 otherwise) 
22:851:70711:17:17:72:543:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:and another that takes a value 1 if a federal supervisor replaces the current state supervisor at t+2 
22:852:70812:17:18:72:544:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:(0  otherwise).  If  the  coefficients  on  these  additional  dummies  display  the  identical  sign  as  the  
22:853:70924:18:17:71:545:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect  of  having  a  federal  supervisor  in  the  current  quarter,  one  may  conclude  that  there  is  
22:854:71033:17:17:71:542:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence of anticipatory action on the part of the bank. To understand why, suppose that at time 
22:855:71130:17:17:71:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:t=0 a bank expects to be required to increase its Tier1 capital by a federal regulator scheduled to 
22:856:71230:17:18:71:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine it on site two quarters after. Since raising Tier1 capital on a short notice may be costly, 
22:857:71330:18:17:71:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  bank  is  likely  to  attempt  to  raise  it  ahead  of  the  regulatory  switch,  which  would  help  make  
22:858:71444:17:17:71:544:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  bank’s  adjustment  to  the  new  regulator  go  more  smoothly.  This  may  induce  the  bank  to  
22:859:71549:17:17:71:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase its Tier1 capital not only at period t= 2, when the new regulator actually comes in, but 
22:860:71647:17:18:71:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibly  also  at  t=  1  and  t=  0,  even  if  the  current  regulator  has  no  particular  concerns  about  
22:861:71760:18:17:71:106:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tier1.

22:863:71768:17:17:71:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:Panel  A  and  Panel  B  of  Table  8  display  the  dynamics  of  anticipating  changes  on  account  of  a  
22:864:71878:17:18:71:547:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:switch  from  state  supervision  to  federal  supervision   by   SMBs   and   NMBs,   respectively.   
22:865:71981:18:17:71:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:Anticipatory  motives  are  evident  in  Tier1  RBCR,  leverage  ratio,  and  non-performing  loans  and  
22:866:72087:17:17:72:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:delinquencies among SMBs expecting Fed to supervise them in next cycle or two; additionally, 
22:867:72180:17:17:72:491:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:such motives appear in ROA of SMBs and NMBs scheduled for federal supervision.22

22:870:72296:17:17:71:545:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  section  presents  a  first  attempt  at  assessing  whether  more  lenient  behavior  displayed  by  
22:871:72404:17:17:71:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:state regulators – their lower willingness to initiate downgrades across banks in our sample (and 
22:872:72502:17:18:71:519:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher willingness to initiate upgrades for SMBs) – can be interpreted as a desirable feature.  
22:873:72598:18:17:72:75:312:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
22:874:72598:17:17:72:545:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:On  the  one  hand,  excessive  regulatory  strictness  may  stifle  innovation  of  the  banking  sector,  
22:875:72706:17:17:71:545:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:thereby  hampering  growth  of  the  corporate  sector,  as  some  have  argued.  On  the  other  hand,  
22:876:72811:17:18:72:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:excessive regulatory leniency may be the telltale sign of regulatory capture and lead to excessive 
22:877:72910:18:17:71:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk-taking,  as  others  have  contended  (see  Scott  (1977)  for  a  discussion  of  both  views).  Both  
22:878:73019:17:17:71:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:arguments have been reiterated in the debate around regulatory failures during the build-up to the 
22:879:73118:17:17:71:549:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008–09   financial   crisis.   However,   to   our   knowledge   there   is   no   empirical   evidence   
22:880:73225:17:18:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:systematically evaluating either of these claims. Here we take a step in this direction and provide 
22:881:73325:18:17:71:241:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:a tentative assessment of the issue. 
22:882:73362:17:17:71:74:157:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
22:883:73362:17:17:71:543:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:We start by examining the correlation between the strictness of federal regulators relative to their 
22:884:73463:17:18:71:546:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:state  counterparts–henceforth,  the  ‘federal-state  spread’–and  an  outcome  that  is  considered  
22:885:73565:18:17:71:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:unambiguously negative within financial markets: bank failures. Such failures hamper the proper 
22:886:73661:17:22:71:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:functioning  of  the  financial  system  and  can  stall  real  economic  activity  (Calomiris  and  Gorton,

22:888:73831:8:16:72:500:58:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 Notice that this econometric approach is not needed when studying CAMELS ratings. The reason is that 
22:889:73935:16:0:72:506:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:CAMELS ratings can only change in the quarter of the on-site examination conducted by the new regulator. 
23:890:74044:0:17:72:544:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:1991).23  Notice  that  it  is  not  obvious  whether  the  relative  leniency  of  a  state  regulator  would  
23:891:74156:17:17:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:manifest  itself  in  a  higher  failure  or  problem-bank  rate  in  that  state.  On  the  one  hand,  even  if  
23:892:74271:17:17:72:545:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:state  regulators  are  lenient,  corrective  actions  by  federal  regulators  –if  implemented–  should  
23:893:74378:17:18:72:543:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:improve the health of a bank and reduce its chances of failure. On the other hand, it might be the 
23:894:74477:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:case  that  state  regulatory  laxity  slows  down  corrective  actions  by  the  Fed  or  FDIC,  thereby  
23:895:74584:17:17:72:326:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing the chances of a bank failing in that state.

23:897:74640:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:We use data on bank failure rates and problem-bank (i.e., banks close to failing) rates over our 
23:898:74737:18:17:72:544:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample  period  to  conduct  our  analysis.24  To  streamline  the  presentation  of  the  results  and  gain  
23:899:74848:17:17:71:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistical power, we pool federal regulators together in this and the following sections.25 Panel A 
23:900:74949:17:17:72:543:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  Table  9  presents  the  results  using  the  baseline  specification  of  Table  3  and  4  and  using  the  
23:901:75063:17:18:72:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:composite CAMELS rating as the dependent variable. The federal agency indicator in Table 9 is 
23:902:75157:18:17:72:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:interacted with whether or not the state is above or below the cross-state median in terms of bank 
23:903:75256:17:17:72:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure  rate  (column  1)  and  problem-bank  rate  (column  2).  The  coefficients  suggest  that,  for  
23:904:75363:17:17:72:544:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks  in  our  sample,  federal  regulators  always  imposes  higher  CAMELS  ratings  than  the  state  
23:905:75469:17:18:72:544:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulator  (hence,  the  state  is  more  lenient  on  average),  but  the  federal  regulator  does  this  even  
23:906:75583:18:17:72:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:more so in states with high bank-failure rates and high problem-bank rates. The null hypothesis 
23:907:75679:17:17:72:540:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:that there are no differences in coefficients across the two groups is rejected statistically in chi-
23:908:75780:17:17:72:469:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:square tests for both bank failure rate (p=0.001) and problem-bank rate (p=0.014). 
23:909:75863:17:18:72:78:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:  
23:910:75865:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  find  qualitatively  similar  results  in  Panel  B  of  Table  9  where  we  estimate  a  cross-sectional  
23:911:75977:17:17:72:544:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression  of  bank-failure  rates  in  a  given  state  on  the  federal-state  spread  for  the  CAMELS  
23:912:76085:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:rating that is estimated over the entire sample period. In column (1), we report the results for all 
23:913:76186:17:18:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  states  in  our  sample.  The  federal-state  spread  is  positively  associated  with  the  bank-failure  
23:914:76298:18:17:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate  in  that  state.  In  other  words,  states  where  bank-failure  rates  are  high  are  also  those  where  
23:915:76413:17:17:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:state  regulators  appear  less  willing  to  apply  strict  ratings  relative  to  their  federal  counterparts.  
23:916:76528:17:17:72:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  economic  magnitudes  suggested  by  the  coefficients  are  large  –  a  one  standard  deviation  
23:917:76633:17:18:72:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:movement  in  the  federal-state  spread  (0.07)  is  associated  with  about  40  percent  increase  in  the  
23:918:76744:18:17:72:543:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank failure rates relative to the mean rate across states. In column (2), we restrict our sample to 
23:919:76845:17:17:72:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:states  with  more  than  20  banks  to  improve  the  precision  of  our  estimated  federal-state  spread.  
23:920:76955:17:17:72:544:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  results  become  both  quantitatively  and  statistically  stronger.  For  the  sake  of  completeness,  
23:921:77065:17:18:72:545:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  also  conduct  the  cross-sectional  analysis  using  the  problem-bank  rate  as  the  dependent  
23:922:77168:18:17:72:479:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable and find results that are qualitatively similar (unreported for brevity's sake).

23:925:77320:8:16:72:527:128:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 While bank failures are an important element in banking supervision and frequently discussed in the context of 
23:926:77434:16:11:71:530:112:100:Times:100:Times:F:banking crises, policymakers are also interested in ensuring that credit is allocated efficiently in the economy. For 
23:927:77552:11:12:71:526:101:100:Times:100:Times:F:instance, if policymakers wanted, they could eliminate banking failures through a very high reserve requirement; 
23:928:77665:12:7:72:305:89:100:Times:100:Times:F:however, this would substantially affect credit allocation.  
23:929:77726:7:16:72:542:82:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 Problem banks are identified using the criterion employed by regulators; i.e., banks that have composite CAMELS 
23:930:77841:16:7:71:315:66:100:Times:100:Times:F:ratings of 4 and 5, as defined in the FDIC problem bank list. 
23:931:77903:7:17:72:527:59:42:g_d0_f6:100:Times:F:25 There are also legal constraints we face in trying to explore the heterogeneity of effects across different federal 
23:932:78022:17:0:72:111:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:agencies. 
24:933:78036:0:17:72:545:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our  final  point  in  this  section  involves  considering  potential  benefits  forgone  by  reducing  
24:934:78141:17:17:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory  leniency.  One  prominent  cost  that  might  result  from  excessive  regulatory  stringency  
24:935:78248:17:17:72:543:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:could  be  a  reduction  in  the  credit  supply  in  the  economy.  This  question  can  be  assessed  within  
24:936:78360:17:18:72:545:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  setting  presented  in  Section  4.2.  Table  10  presents  estimates  of  the  impact  of  supervisor  
24:937:78469:18:17:72:546:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:identity  on  a  bank’s  growth  of  new  loans  in  the  short  run.  The  estimated  effects  are  both  
24:938:78576:17:17:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantitatively and statistically insignificant. These findings suggest that vis-à-vis state regulators, 
24:939:78680:17:17:72:407:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:more-stringent federal regulators do not appear to limit credit supply. 
24:940:78752:17:18:72:75:606:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
24:941:78752:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:We note here that, while the results in this section are novel, the evidence is partially suggestive. 
24:942:78854:17:17:72:542:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our results on bank failure and problem-bank rates do not benefit from the identification strategy 
24:943:78953:17:17:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:of Section 3, while our results on credit supply do. Admittedly, interpreting the bank failure and 
24:944:79052:17:18:72:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:problem-bank  rates  results  causally  would  require  strong  assumptions  on  how  the  federal-state  
24:945:79158:18:17:72:242:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:spreads are assigned across states.

24:947:79195:17:17:72:271:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.4 Additional Results and Robustness 
24:948:79232:17:18:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:In this subsection we present additional results by extending some of our findings and providing 
24:949:79329:18:17:72:478:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:robustness checks. For brevity we limit the analysis to composite CAMELS ratings.

24:951:79411:17:17:72:305:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:Market Discipline: Public versus Private Banks 
24:952:79458:17:18:72:546:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:A  recurring  discussion  among  economists  and  policymakers  alike  revolves  around  whether  
24:953:79556:18:17:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarities exist between market discipline and regulation (Brunnermeier et al., 2009). In 
24:954:79653:17:17:72:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:our context, one could expect that publicly traded companies –with more stringent requirements 
24:955:79748:17:17:72:543:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:of information disclosure and formal external governance and scrutiny– would be more likely to 
24:956:79843:17:18:72:331:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:part from the regulatory idiosyncrasies found earlier.  
24:957:79899:18:17:72:75:312:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
24:958:79899:17:17:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  investigate  this  issue  and  present  our  results  in  Table  11.  We  use  a  specification  similar  to  
24:959:80013:17:17:72:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:that used in Panel A of Table 9 with the difference being that here we interact the federal agency 
24:960:80112:17:18:72:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator  with  dummies  for  whether  the  bank  is  publicly  traded  or  privately  held.  Our  results  
24:961:80221:18:17:72:545:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest  that  the  difference  in  the  federal-state  spreads  for  CAMELS  ratings  is  significantly  
24:962:80327:17:17:72:547:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller  for  publicly  traded  entities  than  for  private  banks.  Notwithstanding  the  inherent  
24:963:80429:17:17:72:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:complexity  of  publicly  traded  banks,  which  are  more  likely  to  be  large  and  intricate  entities,  
24:964:80539:17:18:72:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:there appear to be a convergence in assessments of both state and federal regulators for publicly 
24:965:80637:18:17:72:545:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:traded  banks.    While  we  recognize  that  a  plethora  of  omitted  variables  could  potentially  be  
24:966:80744:17:17:72:545:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving  these  results,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  such  convergence  arises  precisely  in  the  
24:967:80854:17:17:72:547:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:presence   of   market-generated   knowledge.   This   finding   is   broadly   consistent   with   Beck,   
24:968:80962:17:18:72:543:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2003), who find that a supervisory strategy that empowers private 
24:969:81055:18:17:72:544:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:monitoring  of  bank  lending  is  more  effective  compared  with  supervision  by  official  agencies  
24:970:81160:17:17:72:104:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:alone. 
24:971:81167:17:17:72:75:71:144:Times:144:Times:B:

25:973:81171:0:17:72:219:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pre and Post Financial Crisis 
25:974:81201:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 12 focuses on the structural change in US banking supervision occurring around the recent 
25:975:81297:17:17:72:543:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial crisis. The financial turmoil brought an unprecedented amount of attention to the role of 
25:976:81397:17:18:72:545:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators,  especially  the  Fed  and  the  FDIC.  In  Table  12  we  are  able  to  rebut  the  
25:977:81504:18:17:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis  that  the  results  discussed  in  Section  4.1  may  be  entirely  driven  by  the  recent  crisis,  
25:978:81618:17:17:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:during which both the Fed and FDIC acquired much more activist roles in both nonsupervisory 
25:979:81710:17:17:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:and supervisory areas. We check for changes in the behavior of federal regulators by comparing 
25:980:81805:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:the federal-state spreads during the crisis with the spreads during the period before it. Table 12 
25:981:81904:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:presents specifications similar to those in Table 11, with the difference being that we interact the 
25:982:82005:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal agency indicator with dummies for the pre-crisis (2000-06) and crisis periods (2007-09). 
25:983:82102:17:17:72:545:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  difference  in  the  federal-state  spreads  for  CAMELS  ratings  is  significantly  smaller  in  the  
25:984:82211:17:18:72:545:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-crisis  period,  but  remains  positive  and  highly  statistically  significant  across  both  sample  
25:985:82319:18:17:72:546:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:periods.  We  can  only  speculate  about  the  sources  of  the  stronger  divergence  in  composite  
25:986:82422:17:17:72:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:CAMELS ratings assigned by federal versus state regulators during the crisis; however, the fact 
25:987:82518:17:17:72:547:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  greater  attention  was  paid  to  the  actions  of  federal  regulators  appears  a  reasonable  
25:988:82622:17:18:72:224:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation for the divergence. 
25:989:82654:18:17:72:75:450:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
25:990:82654:17:17:72:198:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:Regional Heterogeneity    
25:991:82680:17:17:72:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:We now investigate the extent of regional heterogeneity in the federal-state spreads. Our goal is 
25:992:82778:17:18:71:544:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  exclude  the  possibility  that  our  results  may  be  driven  by  a  specific  subset  of  states  or  by  a  
25:993:82894:18:17:71:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific  regional  district  of  the  prudential  supervisor.26  To  evaluate  heterogeneity  across  states,  
25:994:83006:17:17:72:544:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  propose  a  simple  extension  of  the  specification  (7)  that  permits  a  different  dummy  for  the  
25:995:83116:17:17:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal regulator depending on the specific state that bank i belongs to. In essence, instead of a 
25:996:83215:17:18:72:547:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:single  federal-state  dummy  Sit,  which  compares  federal  regulators  with  the  average  state  
25:997:83316:18:17:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulator,  we  estimate  50  different  federal-state  contrasts.  This  allows  us  to  assess  whether  the  
25:998:83428:17:17:72:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators  appear  tougher  than  state  regulators  across  the  vast  majority  of  states  or  if  a  
25:999:83543:17:17:71:542:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:small subset of states with state regulators that are more lenient than federal regulators is driving 
25:1000:83645:17:18:71:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:our  results.    Figure  5  reports  the  coefficients  on  the  state  dummy  variables  interactions  for  the  
25:1001:83759:18:17:71:543:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators  with  their  5  percent  confidence  intervals.  In  this  figure  we  plot  a  dashed  line  
25:1002:83874:17:17:71:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:which  illustrates  the  average  state  behavior  under  a  specification  analogous  to  column  (1)  of  
25:1003:83982:17:17:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tables  3  and  4.  To  make  the  interactions  meaningful  we  only  report  states  with  more  than  10  
25:1004:84091:17:18:71:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks. Figure 5 displays precisely estimated effects that are overwhelmingly above zero –i.e. the 
25:1005:84189:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal regulators systematically assign higher CAMELS than specific states' regulators. Notice, 
25:1006:84286:17:17:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:however,  that  certain  states  appear  less  lenient  than  others  and  some  even  tougher  than  federal  
25:1007:84397:17:17:72:193:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators (below zero).  
25:1008:84423:17:18:72:75:123:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
25:1009:84423:18:17:72:547:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  also  examined  the  heterogeneity  within  federal  regulators  by  following  an  analogous  
25:1010:84522:17:22:72:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:procedure. The specification in this case compared each federal regulator in its different regional

25:1012:84682:8:16:72:541:58:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 Both Fed and FDIC prudential supervision activities are in fact organized by geographical divisions—specifically, 
25:1013:84799:16:0:72:338:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:by 12 regional Federal Reserve Districts and eight FDIC Regions. 
26:1014:84868:0:17:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:districts against the “average” state regulator in that regional jurisdiction. We do not report these 
26:1015:84970:17:17:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:results  for  brevity’s  sake,  but  we  note  here  that  no  particular  regional  district  appears  to  be  
26:1016:85082:17:17:72:175:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:driving our results.

26:1018:85106:18:17:72:305:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.      Why the Difference among Regulators? 
26:1019:85151:17:17:72:75:640:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
26:1020:85151:17:17:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our findings so far have highlighted substantial differences both in the behavior of state versus 
26:1021:85249:17:18:72:546:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators  and  in  the  behavior  of  banks  as  a  result  of  the  rotation  of  prudential  
26:1022:85355:18:17:72:542:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisors. However, we have not presented any evidence suggesting what the likely sources of 
26:1023:85450:17:17:72:377:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:this heterogeneity are. In this section, we investigate this issue. 
26:1024:85518:17:17:72:75:554:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
26:1025:85518:17:18:72:546:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:One  reason  for  a  softer  stance  by  state  supervisors  could  be  that  they  are  captured  by  the  
26:1026:85626:18:17:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:constituents  they  supervise.  Since  Stigler  (1971)  and  Peltzman  (1976),  economists  have  argued  
26:1027:85732:17:17:72:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  constituents  being  regulated  exert  pressure  on  their  regulators  for  their  benefit  by  applying  
26:1028:85845:17:17:72:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:influence. In the context of banking, it is well documented that a majority of states finance their 
26:1029:85945:17:18:72:545:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:prudential  supervision  efforts  through  the  use  of  assessment  fees  proportional  to  bank  assets  
26:1030:86052:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Blair  and  Kushmeider  (2006)).  As  a  result,  large  banks  hold  a  disproportionate  weight  in  the  
26:1031:86161:17:17:72:546:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:existence  of  state  supervision,  since  they  represent  the  largest  revenue  source  for  the  state  
26:1032:86269:17:17:72:543:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulator itself.27 In addition, because relocation and charter-switch costs are largely fixed, large 
26:1033:86371:17:18:72:548:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks   are   also   more   likely   to   escape   state   regulator   controls,   vis-à-vis   smaller   banks.   
26:1034:86485:18:17:72:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:Incidentally,  this  assessment  fee  structure  is  not  just  a  feature  of  state  banking  regulators,  but  
26:1035:86599:17:17:72:544:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:also  of  federal  ones,  such  as  the  OCC  and  the  (former)  OTS.  The  Fed  and  the  FDIC,  however,  
26:1036:86708:17:17:72:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  federal  regulators  not  funded  through  assessment  fees  and  they  receive  no  payment  from  
26:1037:86813:17:18:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:member  or  nonmember  banks  for  their  on-site  examinations.  It  may  be  the  case  that,  although  
26:1038:86920:18:17:72:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:states  might  be  exposed  to  political  capture,  the  Fed  and  the  FDIC  might  be  immune  to  such  
26:1039:87028:17:17:72:230:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressure from state constituents. 
26:1040:87062:17:17:72:75:278:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
26:1041:87062:17:18:72:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:We  explore  this  conjecture  by  assessing  whether  the  importance  of  large  banks  for  regulatory  
26:1042:87169:18:17:72:544:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival of some state regulators may induce these regulators to be more lenient. The results of 
26:1043:87266:17:17:72:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:our  analysis  are  presented  in  Table  13.  We  follow  a  stringent  approach  and  use  within-bank  
26:1044:87372:17:17:72:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation  -  this  limits  the  power  of  our  analysis  because  of  the  fact  that  large  banks  tend  to  
26:1045:87485:17:18:72:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:remain large (and generally bank size is very persistent). Specifically, we estimate our baseline 
26:1046:87583:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification (7) including a control for the bank being in the top quartile of the size distribution 
26:1047:87685:17:17:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the state and an interaction of the size percentile with the federal regulator dummy. As before, 
26:1048:87785:17:17:72:543:140:144:Times:144:Times:B:we find that state regulators are more lenient than federal regulators. However, we also find that 
26:1049:87884:17:18:72:543:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:state regulators tend to be even more lenient when dealing with larger banks. The coefficient on 
26:1050:87981:18:16:72:547:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  interaction  is  statistically  significant  and  positive  and  about  one  third  of  the  average  
26:1051:88088:16:8:72:218:89:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
26:1052:88148:8:16:72:509:81:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 It is important to note that even if state regulators charge for exams, such resources may not be necessarily 
26:1053:88261:16:11:72:530:65:100:Times:100:Times:F:earmarked for bank supervision and may accrue to a general fund. This does not exclude that state regulators may 
26:1054:88374:11:12:71:510:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:still care about the size and relevance of the entities overseen, for instance to justify budgetary and personnel 
26:1055:88488:12:0:71:139:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:appropriations.   
27:1056:88510:0:17:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in CAMELS ratings between federal and state regulators. These results suggest to us 
27:1057:88605:17:17:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:that state regulators may be showing some preferential treatment toward the large banks in their 
27:1058:88702:17:17:72:267:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:jurisdiction (relative to the small ones).  
27:1059:88746:17:18:72:75:675:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:1060:88746:18:17:72:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally, states differ in their banking regulatory philosophy, the characteristics of resources who 
27:1061:88846:17:17:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:implement the regulation, and the type of goals they set for their state bank charters. Indeed, this 
27:1062:88947:17:17:72:543:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:variety in approach is often cited as a major advantage of the US dual banking system (American 
27:1063:89043:17:18:72:545:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bankers  Association  (2009)).  We  assess  here  whether  this  variety  plays  a  role  in  explaining  
27:1064:89149:18:17:71:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory behavior. We focus on how the federal-state spread for CAMELS rating is related to 
27:1065:89243:17:17:71:545:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:some  of  the  measurable  characteristics  of  the  state  supervisory  system,  using  data  from  the  
27:1066:89349:17:17:71:545:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:biannual  Profile  of  State  Bank  Supervisor  (Conference  of  State  Bank  Supervisors)  for  years  
27:1067:89453:17:18:71:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:1996,  1998,  2000,  2002  and  2004.  We  concentrate  on  three  aspects  of  each  state's  supervisory  
27:1068:89561:18:17:71:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:system:  (a)  the  percentage  of  the  budget  spent  in  staff  training;  (b)  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  
27:1069:89676:17:17:71:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercial bank examiners to number of SMB and NMB in the state; and (c) the percentage of 
27:1070:89767:17:17:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:commercial bank examiners with more than five years of experience.28 In our analysis we follow 
27:1071:89862:17:18:72:543:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:the specification similar to that of Table 11, with the difference that the federal agency indicator 
27:1072:89963:18:17:72:544:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  interacted  with  dummy  variables  that  identify  whether  a  given  state  regulator  is  below  or  
27:1073:90071:17:17:72:347:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:above the cross-state median for each of these variables.  
27:1074:90130:17:17:71:74:416:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:1075:90130:17:18:71:546:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table  14  reports  the  results.  Relative  to  the  federal  regulator,  state  regulators  with  lower  
27:1076:90237:18:17:71:545:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:expenditure  on  staff  training  display  more-lenient  behavior  when  it  comes  to  downgrading  
27:1077:90338:17:17:71:545:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:CAMELS  rating  of  banks.  While  this  difference  is  potentially  interesting,  the  evidence  lacks  
27:1078:90444:17:17:71:545:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistical  power.  The  null  hypothesis  of  no  differences  in  coefficients  across  the  two  groups  
27:1079:90553:17:18:71:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level. As shown in the last set of tests in this table, we also 
27:1080:90654:18:17:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:find  that  states  with  a  higher  number  of  examiners  per  bank  and  a  higher  share  of  experienced  
27:1081:90765:17:17:71:547:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:examiners  appear  more  lenient  relative  to  their  federal  regulator.  Both  these  effects  are  
27:1082:90868:17:17:72:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant at the 10 percent confidence level. These findings are interesting because 
27:1083:90969:17:18:71:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:having more examiners per bank and having a greater share of higher tenured examiners should 
27:1084:91062:18:17:71:543:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect better resources for supervising banks. However, having more examiners per bank and a 
27:1085:91156:17:17:71:544:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:more  tenured  staff  may  also  imply  higher  chances  of  being  captured  by  the  regulated  entities.  
27:1086:91265:17:17:71:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  may  occur  because  examiners  are  likely  to  specialize  when  there  are  more  examiners  
27:1087:91367:17:18:71:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:interacting  with  a  few  banks.  In  addition,  future  career  opportunities  at  regulated  entities  are  
27:1088:91478:18:17:71:292:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely for examiners with higher tenure. 
27:1089:91524:17:17:71:74:157:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:1090:91524:17:17:71:74:140:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:1091:91524:17:18:71:320:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:6.     How broadly applicable are these findings? 
27:1092:91574:18:27:71:74:105:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
27:1093:91574:27:8:72:218:78:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                            
27:1094:91634:8:16:72:542:70:42:Times:100:Times:F:28 Each measure is computed using data for each year and then averaged.  Data on the percentage of the budget spent 
27:1095:91750:16:12:72:524:54:100:Times:100:Times:F:on staff training is only available in 2002 and 2004.  Information on the number (and tenure) of the examiners is 
27:1096:91864:12:0:72:145:42:100:Times:100:Times:F:missing for 2004. 
28:1097:91886:0:15:72:543:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:In this section, we examine the correlation between supervisor identity and CAMELS ratings and 
28:1098:91981:15:16:71:543:711:144:Times:144:Times:B:its subcomponents across all federal regulators in a broader universe of banks, including national 
28:1099:92080:16:16:71:543:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks and thrifts, over the same time period. The objective of this analysis is two-fold. First, the 
28:1100:92181:16:16:71:543:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparison of the behavior of federal regulators (Fed and FDIC) with that of state regulators in 
28:1101:92278:16:16:71:543:663:144:Times:144:Times:B:the larger sample relative to this comparison in the rotation sample allows us to discuss the size 
28:1102:92377:16:16:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the bias that bank sorting creates in any empirical analysis that ignores this issue. As discussed 
28:1103:92479:16:16:71:543:631:144:Times:144:Times:B:before, this sorting occurs since banks actively shop for regulators who are likely to be softer on 
28:1104:92579:16:16:71:544:615:144:Times:144:Times:B:them  through  different  channels  such  as  supervisory  ratings  (see  Rezende,  2011).  Second,  this  
28:1105:92686:16:15:71:544:599:144:Times:144:Times:B:exercise will also allow us to make some assessments  of  how  broadly  applicable  our  findings  
28:1106:92785:15:26:71:260:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:might be for all US commercial banks. 
28:1107:92823:26:18:71:74:558:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
28:1108:92823:18:17:71:546:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table  15  includes  all  depository  institutions  in  the  Fed’s  NIC  universe  and  examines  the  
28:1109:92926:17:17:71:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation between CAMELS rating changes and the supervisor identity of all regulators. Since 
28:1110:93021:17:17:71:544:506:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks in this sample differ dramatically both in terms of observables (e.g., ROA, Tier-1 capital 
28:1111:93118:17:18:71:544:489:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratio,  leverage)  and  unobservables  (e.g.,  factors  that  prompt  self-selection  into  a  charter),  it  is  
28:1112:93232:18:17:72:543:471:144:Times:144:Times:B:hard  to  make  direct  comparisons  across  regulators.  Nevertheless,  in  this  naïve  analysis,  we  can  
28:1113:93342:17:17:72:545:454:144:Times:144:Times:B:still  condition  on  bank  balance  sheet  variables  that  capture  its  health  such  as  its  ROA,  Tier  1  
28:1114:93455:17:17:72:543:437:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital ratio, and its asset size. In the pooled OLS regression of column (1) we focus on Fed and 
28:1115:93553:17:18:72:543:420:144:Times:144:Times:B:FDIC coefficients, which, as in Tables 3 and 4, are contrasts against the average state regulatory 
28:1116:93652:18:17:72:548:402:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior   (the   excluded   category).   The   estimated   coefficients   appear   quantitatively   and   
28:1117:93759:17:17:72:543:385:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically larger than what is estimated in column (1) of Tables 3 and 4 for the Fed and FDIC, 
28:1118:93857:17:17:72:545:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:respectively.  The  likely  reason  for  this  upward  bias  is  that  banks  sorting  into  SMB  or  NMB  
28:1119:93964:17:18:72:544:351:144:Times:144:Times:B:status do so for an advantage, which may well include state regulator leniency. If banks looking 
28:1120:94061:18:17:72:543:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:for leniency on the part of state regulators are also the ones most likely to trigger severe scrutiny 
28:1121:94163:17:17:72:542:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the part of federal regulators (as a quest for leniency may indicate worse conditions), then this 
28:1122:94264:17:17:72:545:299:144:Times:144:Times:B:can  explain  the  increase  in  the  Fed/state  and  FDIC/state  spreads  when  such  selection  is  not  
28:1123:94371:17:18:72:144:282:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounted for. 
28:1124:94386:18:17:72:75:264:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
28:1125:94386:17:17:72:545:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:In  columns  (2)  through  (4),  we  exploit  within-quarter  and  within-bank  variation  to  make  the  
28:1126:94492:17:17:72:544:230:144:Times:144:Times:B:pooled  analysis  progressively  more  comparable  to  the  one  conducted  in  Tables  3  and  4.  As  is  
28:1127:94600:17:17:72:543:213:144:Times:144:Times:B:evident from the results, state regulators tend to be more lenient relative to all federal regulators 
28:1128:94702:17:18:72:543:196:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the exception of the OTS. In particular, note that the federal regulators we analyzed earlier 
28:1129:94801:18:17:72:545:178:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the  Fed  and  FDIC)  still  appear  to  be  tougher  than  state  regulators.  By  column  (4),  which  
28:1130:94907:17:17:71:544:161:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes both bank and quarter fixed effects, the magnitudes of the estimates of the strictness of 
28:1131:95006:17:17:71:544:144:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  Fed  and  FDIC  relative  to  state  regulators  are  similar  to  those  found  in  Section  4.1.  This  
28:1132:95117:17:18:71:544:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests  that,  while  self-selection  is  an  important  issue  in  the  pooled  cross-sectional  sample,  
28:1133:95226:18:17:71:545:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditioning  on  unobserved  time-invariant  components  is  sufficient  to  isolate  the  treatment  
28:1134:95329:17:17:71:544:92:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of supervisor identity. The similarity across the estimates in column (1) of Tables 3 and 4 
28:1135:95428:17:17:71:539:75:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  column  (4)  of  Table  15  suggests  that  the  unobservables  driving  sorting  might  not  be  time-
28:1136:95536:17:0:71:545:58:144:Times:144:Times:B:varying,  but  fixed.  We  believe  this  is  a  relevant  contribution  to  the  literature  on  regulatory  
29:1137:95650:0:17:72:545:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:shopping  and  bank  sorting.  Inclusion  of  bank  and  quarter  fixed  effects  appears  a  sufficient  
29:1138:95756:17:17:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:correction  to  account  for  regulatory  shopping.  Importantly,  this  assessment  is  only  possible  
29:1139:95861:17:17:72:532:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:because of the availability of our earlier results employing a well-identified causal benchmark.

29:1142:95992:17:17:72:75:640:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
29:1143:95992:17:17:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  main  contribution  of  this  paper  lies  in  an  assessment  of  the  structure  of  US  dual  banking  
29:1144:96103:17:18:72:543:606:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervision  by  examining  the  nature  and  consequences  of  supervisory  decisions.  This  is  a  hard  
29:1145:96211:18:17:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical endeavor largely due to the difficulty in separating regulatory arbitrage by banks from 
29:1146:96309:17:17:72:543:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:the real influence of bank supervisors. Self-selection by banks is not just a theoretical possibility. 
29:1147:96412:17:17:72:544:554:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  issue  has  been  prevalent  in  the  policy  and  academic  debate  (e.g.,  see  Rezende,  2011).We  
29:1148:96520:17:18:72:544:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:circumvent this challenge by exploiting a legally determined rotation policy that assigns federal

29:1150:96722:17:17:72:547:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulators   are   significantly   less   lenient,   downgrading   supervisory   ratings   about   twice   as   
29:1151:96834:17:17:72:545:485:144:Times:144:Times:B:frequently  as  state  supervisors.  As  a  consequence  of  these  actions,  under  federal  regulators,  
29:1152:96941:17:18:72:545:468:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks  report  higher  non-performing  loans,  more  delinquent  loans,  higher  regulatory  capital  
29:1153:97043:18:17:72:190:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratios, and lower ROA.

29:1155:97067:17:17:72:547:416:144:Times:144:Times:B:While  the  paper  falls  short  of  providing  a  definitive  answer  as  to  whether  the  US  dual  
29:1156:97170:17:18:72:549:399:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisory   system   is   optimal,   to   our   knowledge,   it   clearly   documents   inconsistent   
29:1157:97275:18:17:72:545:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:implementation  of  the  same  set  of  rules  by  different  regulators  within  this  system.  This  is  a  
29:1158:97385:17:17:72:545:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:consequential  finding  since  inconsistencies  between  regulators  can  delay  corrective  regulatory  
29:1159:97490:17:17:72:544:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:actions.  Our  results  also  indicate  that  leniency  by  state  regulators  may  also  be  costly  since  it  
29:1160:97603:17:18:72:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:B:induces variability in bank operations. Moreover, this may potentially reduce the transparency of 
29:1161:97701:18:17:72:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:bank balance-sheets for agents in the economy who are unaware of the source of this variability.

29:1163:97798:17:17:72:544:278:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our  paper  speaks  to  the  debate  on  supervision  and  regulation  of  banks  prompted  by  the  recent  
29:1164:97907:17:18:72:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:B:financial crisis. The 2008-09 crisis has made it clear that regulating and supervising complex and 
29:1165:98006:18:17:72:546:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:interconnected  financial  institutions  requires  significant  coordination  across  regulators.  An  
29:1166:98109:17:17:72:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:opposing view is the notion that dual supervision enhances the nature of decision making since it 
29:1167:98207:17:17:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:allows for state supervisors, who use local knowledge, to compete with federal supervisors, who 
29:1168:98303:17:18:71:544:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:rely  on  broader  perspective.  Our  findings  on  inconsistent  oversight  and  on  bank  failures  cast  
29:1169:98411:18:17:72:543:174:144:Times:144:Times:B:serious doubt on this view and instead suggest a re-evaluation of the exact nature of benefits of 
29:1170:98509:17:17:72:229:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:the US dual supervision system. 
29:1171:98541:17:17:72:75:140:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
29:1172:98541:17:18:72:545:123:144:Times:144:Times:B:As  we  contemplate  the  regulatory  reforms  currently  being  proposed,  it  is  vital  to  consider  the  
29:1173:98651:18:17:72:545:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:structure of  regulation  that  they  may  engender.  Federal  Reserve  Chairmen  (Bernanke,  2010;  
29:1174:98751:17:17:72:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:Greenspan,  1997)  have  argued  that  supervisory  activities  provide  significant  information  useful  
29:1175:98858:17:17:72:543:71:144:Times:144:Times:B:to carry out monetary policy decisions (also see Goodhart 2001 for Fed's role as a lender of last 
29:1176:98956:17:0:72:544:54:144:Times:144:Times:B:resort  or  the  FDIC's  role  in  setting  premia  on  deposit  insurance).  That  said,  some  critics  want  
30:1177:99072:0:17:72:545:726:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal  regulators  removed  from  day-to-day  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority,  since  their  
30:1178:99176:17:17:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:“other  responsibilities”  might  adversely  impact  their  supervisory  decisions.  Our  results  suggest  
30:1179:99284:17:17:72:547:692:144:Times:144:Times:B:that,  while  other  roles  may  make  federal  regulators  more  lenient  in  absolute  terms,  their  
30:1180:99388:17:18:72:544:675:144:Times:144:Times:B:supervisory  decisions  appear  significantly  less  lenient  relative  to  their  current  state  regulatory  
30:1181:99499:18:17:72:137:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:counterparts.

30:1183:99513:17:16:72:544:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finally,  this  paper  also  speaks  to  other  regulated  industries  such  as  insurance.  While  currently  
30:1184:99624:16:16:71:543:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulated solely at the state level, Congress has on several occasions introduced proposals for a 
30:1185:99722:16:16:71:545:591:144:Times:144:Times:B:“federal  charter”  for  insurance  companies.29  The  notion  is  that  it  would  “help  streamline  and  
30:1186:99830:16:16:72:543:575:144:Times:144:Times:B:modernize the antiquated and patchwork system of state insurance regulation” and would parallel 
30:1187:99926:16:15:72:544:559:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  current  dual  banking  supervisory  system.30  We  see  our  results  on  heterogeneous  regulatory
