3:42:1717:20:15:110:514:474:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:This paper studies the role of exit from a monetary union during a debt crisis.  A monetary union,
3:43:1815:15:15:96:514:459:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:such as the European Monetary Union, needs to establish a procedure for exit as a tool to cope with
3:44:1914:15:16:96:514:444:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:debt default.  The paper studies various forms of exit and argues that “Euroization” is both a credible
3:45:2017:16:40:96:333:428:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:and effective means of punishment for countries in default.
3:46:2076:40:26:71:173:388:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:1  Motivation
3:47:2089:26:17:71:539:362:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:This paper confronts a fundamental problem of a monetary union:  how to best arrange the orderly exit of a
3:48:2195:17:17:71:539:345:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:member country?  The context, reflecting current debate, is one of debt distress and the potential for default.
3:49:2306:17:17:71:539:328:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Dealing with countries in this situation within a union, such as the European Monetary Union, is important
3:50:2412:17:16:71:177:311:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for two primary reasons.
3:51:2436:16:17:86:539:295:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:First,  exit must be a viable option for punishment of countries who default on their obligations.  Any
3:52:2539:17:17:71:539:278:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:federation of sovereigns allows for some decentralized decision making.  This is true for the two leading unions
3:53:2651:17:17:71:539:261:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in the United States and in Europe.  For these federations, it must be recognized that some member states
3:54:2756:17:16:71:539:244:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:(countries)  might  use  their  residual  power  to  pursue  their  self  interest  to  the  detriment  of  the  federation
3:55:2879:16:17:71:539:228:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:as a whole.  This can include excessive expansionary fiscal policy, leading to debt default.  In this case,  a
3:56:2989:17:17:71:309:211:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:mechanism for exit is useful as a means ofdiscipline.
3:57:3042:17:16:86:539:194:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Second, exit must be seen as a potential punishment as countries contemplate the future path of fiscal
3:58:3144:16:17:71:539:178:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:policy.  That is, from the perspective of providing incentives for good behavior, a well-specified exit process
3:59:3255:17:17:71:539:161:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:is valuable.  For example, a state (country) thinking of embarking on a fiscal program that might enhance
3:60:3360:17:15:71:539:144:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the prospect of needing a bail-out will be influenced by the existence of a stark punishment through exit
3:61:3465:15:16:82:540:129:6:g_d0_f10:8:g_d0_f11:F:∗I am grateful to Hubert Kempf and Dan Peled for ongoing discussions of these issues and our joint work that framed my
3:62:3583:16:8:72:164:113:8:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:F:views on these problems.

4:64:3689:0:17:72:540:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:from the federation.  Even countries at the brink of default might be motivated to repay their debt if exit is
4:65:3799:17:16:72:442:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:a form of punishment.  The mechanism for exit providesincentivesto avoid default.
4:66:3880:16:17:86:540:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:But not any mechanism will do.  The mechanism put in place to facilitate exit must becredible.  Recent
4:67:3982:17:17:71:539:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:history of institution building within the European Union is wrought with plans that appear to be effective
4:68:4089:17:17:71:539:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:but in fact are not credible.  These plans do not solve any problems and only serve to heighten unrealistic
4:69:4196:17:16:71:128:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:expectations.
4:70:4209:16:17:86:539:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This paper studies a form of exit that draws upon the idea of “Dollarization” or “Euroization” in which
4:71:4312:17:17:71:539:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:one country unilaterally adopts the currency of another (or of a monetary union).  It is argued that this is
4:72:4420:17:17:71:367:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:an effective way to use exit as a means of dealing with a debt crisis.
4:73:4490:17:16:86:539:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The mechanism does not entail complete exit from the monetary union and the creation (recreation) of
4:74:4590:16:17:71:539:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:a new currency for a couple of reasons.  First, it is actually not possible to prevent one country from using
4:75:4699:17:17:71:539:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the currency of another.  That is, a proposal to force a country to withdraw from the Eurozone and create
4:76:4804:17:17:71:539:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:(or recreate) its own currency is not enforceable.  Second, Euroization is more orderly than complete exit.
4:77:4911:17:16:71:539:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Under a Euroization system, all of a country’s preexisting contracts in euros would be enforced.  There is
4:78:5017:16:17:71:539:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:no need for lengthy legal debate on enforcing a contract between individuals in two countries once a new
4:79:5121:17:17:71:421:436:10:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f12:B:currency is in place because the euro would continue to exist in both countries.1
4:80:5202:17:16:86:539:419:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Exit is studied in the context of a fiscal crisis, since this is the current situation in which this option is
4:81:5312:16:17:71:539:403:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:most likely to be exercised.  Section 2 outlines a model of a monetary union in fiscal distress.  The model
4:82:5419:17:17:71:539:386:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:provides the context for assessing the value of Euroization as a tool for fiscal discipline.  Section 3 studies
4:83:5530:17:17:71:539:369:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:a  debt  crisis  in  this  framework  and  provides  conditions  for  a  bailout.   This  lays  the  foundation  for  the
4:84:5651:17:16:71:236:352:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:consideration of Euroization and exit.
4:85:5689:16:17:86:539:336:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Section 4 argues that Euroization is both a credible and effective means of dealing with fiscal distress.
4:86:5794:17:17:71:539:319:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:It serves to both punish countries who pursue excessive fiscal expansions and provides incentives for others
4:87:5902:17:40:71:185:302:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:not to do so in the future.
4:88:5929:40:27:71:230:262:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:2  A Monetary Union
4:89:5948:27:16:71:539:235:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:We formalize these ideas using a model of monetary union taken from Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010).
4:90:6048:16:17:71:539:219:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:We use this structure to make precise the outcomes in the cases of a monetary union,  Euroization and a
4:91:6151:17:34:71:170:202:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:multi-currency regime.
4:92:6173:34:23:71:178:168:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:2.1  Environment
4:93:6189:23:16:71:540:145:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The economy is composed of three regions, indexedi=1,2,3.  For simplicity, all regions are identical in terms
4:94:6298:16:15:71:223:129:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:of size, preferences and technology.
4:95:6334:15:0:83:411:114:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:1See Scott (1998) for a discussion of some of the legal issues involved in a complete exit.
5:96:6426:0:17:86:539:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Here a region can be thought of as a state within a federation or as a country within a monetary union.
5:97:6529:17:16:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The key point is the institutional structure of a central monetary authority and independent fiscal authorities
5:98:6640:16:17:72:499:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:at the regional level.  Whether there is a central fiscal authority is not, for this discussion, crucial.
5:99:6745:17:17:86:539:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The model has overlapping generations.  Agents live for two periods, consuming the single consumption
5:100:6846:17:17:72:539:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:good in each period.  Agents have an lifetime utility given byu(cy) +v(co) whereu(·) andv(·) are strictly
5:101:6951:17:16:71:540:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:increasing and strictly concave.  All agents are endowed withωyunits of the consumption good in youth and
5:102:7056:16:17:72:539:587:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f8:B:ωoin old age.  Agents have access to a storage technology that yieldsx >1 units of the consumption good
5:103:7159:17:17:71:540:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in periodt+ 1 for each unit stored in periodt.  In addition, agents may save by holding debt issued by the
5:104:7265:17:17:71:162:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:region 1 government.
5:105:7285:17:16:86:539:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Finally, there is a legal restriction that requires money to be held in proportion to the level of real storage,
5:106:7397:16:17:71:539:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:as in Smith (1994). One interpretation is that access to the storage technology requires an intermediary which
5:107:7507:17:17:71:258:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:must hold money as a reserve requirement.
5:108:7548:17:17:86:539:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Ultimately the interest is in how two of the regions respond to fiscal problems in a third.  For that reason
5:109:7656:17:16:71:539:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:we suppose that the only region issuing debt is region 1.  A key issue will be how the union of the three
5:110:7761:16:17:71:299:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:countries deals with the repayment of region 1 debt.
5:111:7813:17:17:86:540:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:There is also a central bank,CB, which can print money and make transfers to agents in the economy.
5:112:7912:17:16:71:455:419:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:This same power can be used to bailout the debt obligation of the region 1 government.
5:113:7998:16:17:86:539:403:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:There is a key difference between theCBand the regional government:  the objectives differ.  It is natural
5:114:8104:17:17:71:539:386:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to assume that the regional government acts to in the interest of regional 1 agents.  Likewise, it is natural
5:115:8213:17:17:71:540:369:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to  assume  that  theCBacts  in  the  interest  of  all  agents  in  the  federation.   This  reflects  the  presence  of
5:116:8334:17:16:71:540:352:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:representatives of the regions on the governing board of theCB. As we shall see, this difference in objectives
5:117:8444:16:17:71:539:336:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:is important for understanding bailouts and for the Euroization scheme, which is the form of exit advocated
5:118:8551:17:34:71:126:319:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in this essay.
5:119:8565:34:23:71:267:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:2.2  Model of a Monetary Union
5:120:8595:23:17:71:539:262:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f15:B:As a benchmark, we consider the steady state equilibrium of a monetary union.  The representative regioni

5:122:8773:16:17:86:539:229:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In the portfolio of the agent, there are three elements:  real storage with a fixed returnx, bonds with an
5:123:8879:17:17:71:540:212:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium real return ofRand money with a return of  ̃π, the inverse of the gross inflation rate.  There is
5:124:8988:17:16:71:539:195:10:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f12:B:a binding legal restriction, parameterized by a reserve requirement (λ), to generate a demand for money.2
5:125:9093:16:17:71:540:179:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Working  through  the  algebra,  the  return  on  storage  is  thenR≡x+λ ̃π1+λper  unit  placed  in  storage.   In
5:126:9207:17:17:71:372:162:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium, the return on debt must equal the return on storage,R.

6:138:10010:16:17:86:539:511:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:To focus on the fiscal policy of a single region,  assume that region 1 is the only fiscally active region.

6:162:11498:23:17:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:To understand the factors that determine whether region 1 repays its debt,  we study the outcome of the
6:163:11601:17:17:71:539:102:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:strategic interaction which occurs each period between the government of region 1 and the central authority.
6:164:11709:17:0:71:539:85:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:This sequence is modified below when exit and Euroization are introduced.  The following events occur in

7:166:11928:17:16:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:taxation decisions associated with generationtagents are made in periodt+ 1 after savings decisions have
7:167:12032:16:27:72:206:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:been made by that generation.

7:169:12141:25:17:86:540:602:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f8:A:•If the region 1 government does not pay its debt obligation, theCBcan pay the obligation by printing
7:170:12242:17:24:96:335:585:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:money and transferring it to the region 1 government ;
7:171:12296:24:17:86:540:561:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f8:A:•If neither the region 1 government nor theCBrepays the debt obligation, the region is in default and
7:172:12397:17:27:96:255:544:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:its citizens suffer a default cost ofκ.
7:173:12436:27:16:86:540:517:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Hereκis not modeled explicitly.  In the large literature on debt default, there are many models of this
7:174:12539:16:17:72:540:501:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:cost which include trade disruptions as well as exclusion from markets.3As we elaborate the exit options
7:175:12643:17:17:72:540:484:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:below, these can be viewed as ways of influencing the magnitude of the default cost and just of changing the
7:176:12751:17:33:72:233:467:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:incentives for repayment by region 1.
7:177:12788:33:24:72:363:434:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:2.4  A Steady State with Ricardian Fiscal Policy
7:178:12836:24:16:72:540:410:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Following Cooper,  Kempf,  and Peled (2010) there exists a monetary steady state in which region 1 fiscal
7:179:12941:16:17:72:331:394:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:policy is irrelevant.4Hence we call this a Ricardian regime.
7:180:13001:17:17:86:540:377:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In this steady state, the rate of money growth is zero so thatTi= 0 fori= 1,2,3.  The stock of money
7:181:13101:17:16:72:540:360:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:and prices are constant.  Ifx, the rate of return on storage exceeds one, then the legal restriction on money
7:182:13210:16:17:72:156:344:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:holdings with bind.
7:183:13229:17:17:86:540:327:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Importantly,  in this steady state,  region 1 debt is held only by region 1 agents:B1=b1.  Since debt
7:184:13330:17:17:72:540:310:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:and storage have the same net return ofR, this is really a restriction about how private agents break the
7:185:13435:17:16:72:540:293:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:indifference between holding bonds and storage.  It is innocuous at the level of an agent.  But, this is critical
7:186:13548:16:17:72:229:277:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for this type of equilibrium to exist.
7:187:13586:17:17:86:539:260:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In the extensive form game outlined above, along the equilibrium path the regional government chooses
7:188:13687:17:17:72:540:243:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to repay its debt.  It makes this choice because it anticipates that there would be no bailout from the central
7:189:13798:17:16:72:539:226:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:government.   As  argued  in  Cooper,  Kempf,  and  Peled  (2010),  theCBhas  no  incentive  to  bailout  since
7:190:13909:16:17:72:540:210:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the consumption allocation across agents in the three regions is equal without a bailout.  Thus there is no
7:191:14016:17:17:72:328:193:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:motivate to bailout as a means of smoothing consumption.
7:192:14072:17:17:86:540:176:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Note  that  atκ=  0  the  regional  government  is  actually  indifferent  between  the  repayment  of  debt  or
7:193:14184:17:16:72:540:159:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:default.   The  consumption  levels  of  all  region  1  agents  will  be  the  same,  regardless  of  the  choice  of  the
7:194:14307:16:17:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:regional government.  This is true becauseallregion 1 debt is held by region 1 agents.  The strict incentive
7:195:14415:17:15:72:216:126:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for repayment comes fromκ >0.
7:196:14444:15:10:83:488:111:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:3Eaton and Fernandez (1995) and St ̈ahler (2011) survey these results, including recent quantitative evidence.
7:197:14554:10:0:83:335:101:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:4That paper includes the details for characterizing the steady state.
8:198:14624:0:17:86:539:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:WithT1=  0,  the  region  1  government  must  repay  its  own  debt,τ1=RB1.   This  future  tax  is,  of
8:199:14729:17:16:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:course, anticipated by young region 1 agents.  Since private and public consumption are perfect substitutes
8:200:14836:16:17:72:540:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in preferences, young agents do not care about the composition of consumption.  Taken together, this implies
8:201:14944:17:17:72:540:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:that a change in government transfers leads to an equal change in private savings and thus to bond holdings.
8:202:15052:17:17:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The proceeds from the bond holdings are used to pay the tax in old age.  Thus real consumption allocations
8:203:15158:17:16:72:169:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:are independent ofg1.
8:204:15179:16:17:86:539:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This Ricardian equilibrium will serve as a benchmark for the analysis that follows.  Later when we turn
8:205:15282:17:17:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to  study  the  outcome  of  the  interactions  between  regions,  we  will  have  to  formalize  the  value  of  various
8:206:15403:17:17:72:288:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:outcomes and compared them to this benchmark.
8:207:15448:17:16:86:540:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Let the lifetime utility of a representative agent in one of the regions be given byu(cy∗) +v(co∗) and
8:208:15550:16:17:71:540:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:letV∗= [u(cy∗) +v(co∗)]×1(1−δ)be the social discounted value of the regime, whereδserves as a discount
8:209:15652:17:17:72:100:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:factor.
8:210:15659:17:17:86:539:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Though not modeled here, there are many advantages of monetary union associated with ease of trans-
8:211:15758:17:16:72:540:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:actions, reductions of exchange rate uncertainty along with the delegation of monetary policy that provides
8:212:15865:16:17:72:539:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:economic gain to a properly run monetary union.  Thus we will argue below thatV∗is larger than the utility
8:213:15971:17:33:72:261:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:flows generated by in multi-currency world.
8:214:16014:33:24:72:220:403:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:2.5  Default and Bailout
8:215:16038:24:16:72:540:379:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:But this is not the only possible outcome.  As argued in Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010) there may also
8:216:16141:16:17:72:307:363:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:be an equilibrium with the possibility of debt default.
8:217:16196:17:17:86:539:346:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This other equilibrium would not exist if theCBhad the ability to commit not to bailout a regional
8:218:16294:17:17:72:540:329:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:government. In the absence of such commitment ability, which seems consistent with recent events in Europe,
8:219:16401:17:16:72:422:312:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the incentives for bailout must be established, along with the incentives for exit.
8:220:16484:16:17:86:539:296:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:To see how a bailout might arise, return to the extensive form game and suppose the government of region
8:221:16588:17:17:72:540:279:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:1 announced it was not going to repay its outstanding debt.  In the absence of commitment to repayment,
8:222:16691:17:17:72:540:262:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:this is conceivable.  The question is whether the regional government has an incentive to default and what
8:223:16797:17:16:72:213:245:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the response is to that prospect.
8:224:16830:16:17:86:539:229:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In  the  analysis  of  Cooper,  Kempf,  and  Peled  (2010),  theCBwould  choose  to  undertake  a  monetary
8:225:16937:17:17:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:financed  bailout  of  region  1  debt  if  that  debt  was  largely  held  by  agents  in  other  regions.   If  the  debt  is

8:227:17171:16:17:72:539:179:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to avoid default.5This comes from an incentive of theCBto smooth consumption across the agents in the
8:228:17272:17:17:72:531:162:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:different regions:  Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010) call this aconsumption smoothingmotive for bailout.

8:230:17495:17:14:72:539:128:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:First,  theCBmust have the way to bailout the regional government.  In the model,  this comes from the
8:231:17597:14:16:83:540:114:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:5One way to do so is to setT1>0 and other transfers to zero.  A bailout through more general money creation with transfers
8:232:17719:16:0:71:199:98:8:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:F:to other regions may also possible.

9:243:18077:16:17:71:539:343:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:must  have  a  desire  to  make  these  transfers.   The  desire  itself  comes  from  two  sources:  (i)  the  fact  that
9:244:18199:17:17:71:540:326:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the welfare of agents throughout the regions is included in the objective of theCBand (ii) the gains from
9:245:18304:17:17:71:178:309:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:consumption smoothing.
9:246:18326:17:16:86:539:292:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Anticipating a monetary bailout, the gain to default by the region 1 government is obvious:  others get
9:247:18429:16:17:71:539:276:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the benefit of repaying the debt when region 1 agents bear the cost.  Further, since the debt is repaid, the
9:248:18537:17:40:71:442:259:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:default cost ofκis avoided.  This is the traditional problem of strategic debt default.
9:249:18624:40:27:71:278:219:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3  Debt Crisis: Exit Options
9:250:18652:27:16:71:539:192:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:We extend this analysis to include exit from a monetary union.  For this discussion, exit can take two forms.
9:251:18761:16:17:71:539:176:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The first is the continued use of the common currency of the union without the ability to influence monetary
9:252:18869:17:17:71:539:159:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:policy.  This regime is Euroization.  The second possible form of exit is to force a country to adopt and create
9:253:18981:17:17:71:348:142:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:its own currency.  This multi-currency regime is studied as well.
9:254:19046:17:16:86:539:125:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Once these two options are delineated, we return to the key question of this essay:  what is the role of
9:255:19150:16:17:71:539:109:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:exit in dealing with situations of debt distress?  Using the extended model developed in this section, we are
9:256:19259:17:0:71:479:92:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:able to look at options beyond bailout, including some form of exit from the monetary union.
10:257:19352:0:17:86:539:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The extended game, as shown in Figure 1, involves the regional government (RG) and a central authority,
10:258:19455:17:16:72:539:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:labeled as a central bank.6This central authority includes the central bank as well as a representation of
10:259:19561:16:17:72:540:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the countries in the federation.  The game builds upon the one studied in Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010)
10:260:19666:17:17:72:540:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to allow other options, including euroization and exit from a monetary union, which form the basis of this
10:261:19772:17:17:72:96:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:essay.
10:262:19778:17:16:86:540:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In this section, we use the model to explain the last choices of theCBin the game shown in Figure 1:
10:263:19878:16:34:72:454:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Euroization and Exit.  We then turn to the outcome of the expanded game in section 4.
10:264:19963:34:23:72:171:553:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:3.1  Euroization
10:265:19979:23:17:72:540:530:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The regime termed “Euroization” occurs when region 1 is using the common currency of the monetary union
10:266:20082:17:24:72:403:513:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:but is not involved in policy determination.  The regime is characterized by:
10:267:20159:24:25:86:317:489:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f8:A:•a common currency used in all regions (countries);
10:268:20210:25:25:86:374:464:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f8:A:•the transfer policy of theCBas determined by regions 2 and 3.
10:269:20272:25:25:86:360:439:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f8:A:•region 1 has no influence on the conduct of monetary policy.
10:270:20333:25:16:86:539:414:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This is of course not just a abstract idea but one that has been used in a number of instances around the
10:271:20438:16:17:72:539:398:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:world.7The key to the Euroization regime is the continued use of the euro.  In that case, there is no need
10:272:20544:17:17:72:540:381:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for any restructuring of existing contracts.  Moreover, there is a potential carrot (not modeled) involved:  the
10:273:20656:17:17:72:435:364:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:easy return of the country to full representation in the conduct of monetary policy.
10:274:20740:17:16:86:539:347:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This  regime  is  a  special  case  of  the  model  described  in  section  2.2.   Euroization  adds  a  restriction  to
10:275:20860:16:17:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:participation  in  a  monetary  union.   While  the  other  regions  are unable  to  prevent  the use  of  the euro  in
10:276:20979:17:17:72:540:314:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:region 1, they can deny that region representation in monetary policy decisions.  Thus the objective function
10:277:21088:17:16:72:540:297:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:of theCBfrom the case of a monetary union is amended in the Euroization regime to exclude the welfare
10:278:21189:16:17:72:152:281:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:of region 1 agents.
10:279:21208:17:17:86:539:264:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Note that we need not assumeT1= 0.  It is still possible for theCBto make transfers to region 1.  Yet
10:280:21309:17:17:72:539:247:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in this model, that option is dominated.  In particular, if theCBwishes to, for example, bailout agents in
10:281:21415:17:16:72:337:230:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:regions 2 and 3 it will do so directly withTi>0 fori= 2,3.
10:282:21473:16:17:86:539:214:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This has a natural interpretation.  If region 1 has debt outstanding in a Euroization regime, any bailout
10:283:21578:17:17:72:540:197:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:would be of the debt holders in the member countries, regions 2 and 3, rather than to the region issuing the
10:284:21686:17:17:72:540:180:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:debt.  This is akin to bailing out the banks (and thus shareholders and depositors) who hold the debt rather
10:285:21794:17:16:72:221:163:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:than the country issuing the debt.
10:286:21828:16:17:86:539:147:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:And, there is another important element.  Though agents in regions 2 and 3 would receive the transfer,
10:287:21930:17:15:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:agents in region 1 holding euros, will pay their share of the inflation tax.  Thus Euroization is a means of
10:288:22038:15:16:83:540:115:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:6The decision on Euroization could be made by a different centralized entity.  The results would be the same as long as the
10:289:22161:16:8:72:448:99:8:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:F:objective function, underlying the maximization of the joint welfare of member agents, was the same.
10:290:22261:8:0:83:451:91:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:7Borensztein and Berg (2000) contains a lengthy presentation of a number of cases of dollarization.
11:291:22361:0:17:72:183:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:taxing agents in region 1.
11:292:22387:17:16:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f12:A:For this reason, the governments of region 2 and 3 might choose to create money and tax region 1 agents.8
11:293:22492:16:17:71:480:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:In this case, the welfare of these agents would exceed the benchmark of the Ricardian regime.
11:294:22585:17:17:86:539:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:There  is  a  benefit  to  Euroization  for  region  1.   As  argued  in  the  Cooper  and  Kempf  (2001)  paper  on
11:295:22701:17:17:71:539:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:dollarization, if region 1 wants the commitment power of a strong central bank, then it can have it through
11:296:22808:17:16:71:539:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Euroization.  This is in part a signal to deal directly with fiscal problems, rather than simply printing money
11:297:22919:16:17:71:208:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:using a newly created currency.
11:298:22950:17:17:86:540:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Earlier, we denoted byV∗the steady state value of utility for a representation agent in the Ricardian
11:299:23051:17:17:71:540:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:regime.  To make comparisons with this benchmark, letVEdenote the value to a region 1 representative
11:300:23151:17:16:72:540:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:agent in the steady state of a Euroization regime.  If the rate of money creation chosen by theCBis zero,
11:301:23256:16:17:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:then the welfare of region 1 is the same as in the Ricardian equilibrium:V∗=VE.  But if there is inflation
11:302:23362:17:17:72:389:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:and that tax is born by region 1 agents, Euroization is costly:V∗> VE.
11:303:23432:17:17:86:539:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:LetWEbe the welfare of agents in regions 2 and 3 in a Euroization regime.  If the rate of inflation is
11:304:23534:17:16:72:540:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:zero, then Euroization is equivalent to the Ricardian steady state for agents in these regions:WE=V∗.
11:305:23635:16:17:72:540:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:With positive inflation, the resulting redistribution impliesWE> V∗.  Thus the regions have an incentive
11:306:23739:17:17:72:332:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to inflate and tax the Euro holdings of region 1 households.
11:307:23799:17:16:86:539:419:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Of course, these are all steady state values.  We take account of the transition from one regime to another

11:309:23912:34:23:72:285:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:3.2  Exit from the Monetary Union
11:310:23945:23:17:72:540:346:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:This  section  makes  two  points.   First,  it  characterizes  the  outcome  with  multiple  currencies.   Second,  it
11:311:24064:17:31:72:272:329:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:argues why exit may not be a credible option.
11:312:24109:31:23:72:255:298:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:C:3.2.1  The Multi-currency Economy
11:313:24142:23:16:72:540:275:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Cooper and Kempf (2003) studies the motivation for the formation of a monetary union.  The paper explains
11:314:24247:16:17:72:540:259:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:why there are gains to a monetary union and why those gains may be difficult to reap.  Those arguments are
11:315:24353:17:17:72:448:242:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:relevant here insofar as exit from the monetary union is an alternative to Euroization.
11:316:24440:17:17:86:539:225:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The  paper  attempts  to  capture  two  features  of  a  multi-currency  world:   trading  costs  and  excessive
11:317:24552:17:16:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:inflation due to uncoordinated monetary policies.  The model of Cooper and Kempf (2003) is a multi-country
11:318:24658:16:17:72:540:192:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:setting in which each country controls it money supply and trades with the other.  Because of the trade,
11:319:24762:17:17:72:540:175:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:citizens of one country demand the currency of the other.  This demand generates a source of revenue from
11:320:24867:17:17:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:seigniorage and the equilibrium entails positive inflation as each country follows a “beggar thy neighbor”
11:321:24973:17:14:72:100:141:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:policy.
11:322:24980:14:16:83:540:127:6:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f11:F:8This follows from Proposition 4 in Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010) when the debt obligations of regions 2 and 3 would
11:323:25098:16:0:72:124:111:8:g_d0_f11:8:g_d0_f11:F:be monetized.
12:324:25112:0:17:86:539:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In addition, tastes over goods are uncertain.  This leads to the misallocation of resources as household’s
12:325:25218:17:16:72:440:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:sometimes do not have a portfolio of currencies to match their desired consumption.
12:326:25301:16:17:86:539:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The gains to monetary union come in two forms.  First,  the competitive monetary policies disappear.
12:327:25401:17:17:72:540:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Second,  with a common currency,  there are no portfolio considerations and households are better able to
12:328:25506:17:17:72:326:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:respond to tastes variations in their consumption bundles.
12:329:25564:17:16:86:539:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:It is certainly possible to add preference shocks and multiple goods to the present model to formalize the
12:330:25670:16:17:72:540:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:outcome with exit.  In that case, we would have two countries inside a monetary union and a third with its
12:331:25776:17:17:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:own currency.  That outcome would be qualitatively the same as the one for the two country case studied in
12:332:25882:17:17:72:189:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Cooper and Kempf (2003).
12:333:25906:17:16:86:539:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:It is constructive to compare this case with the Euroization outcome.  The country excluded from the
12:334:26006:16:17:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:eurozone is not using the euro and thus it citizens face a currency portfolio choice problem.  This exclusion
12:335:26115:17:17:72:540:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:means that transactions costs will be higher for the country outside the eurozone than under Euroization.
12:336:26220:17:17:72:540:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The excluded country will demand some of the currency of the remaining union members and thus be subject
12:337:26324:17:16:72:154:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to an inflation tax.
12:338:26344:16:17:86:539:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Assuming that exit is feasible, we letVXbe the welfare of a region 1 agent in the event of exit.  Given the
12:339:26451:17:17:72:540:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:gains to monetary union in the Cooper and Kempf (2003) model, exit is worse for region 1 than Euroization:
12:340:26557:17:16:72:118:419:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f8:B:VX< VE.
12:341:26564:16:17:86:540:403:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Further letWXbe the welfare of region 2 and 3 households in a steady state with multiple currencies.
12:342:26664:17:17:72:539:386:10:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f16:B:From Cooper and Kempf (2003), we know that as long as inflation under Euroization is moderate,WX< WE
12:343:26764:17:17:72:540:369:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:due to the transactions costs associated with multiple currencies that arise from the demand of region 2 and
12:344:26872:17:16:72:192:352:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:3 agents for region 1 goods.
12:345:26900:16:17:86:539:336:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:One  of  the  significant  issues  with  exit  is  whether  it  is  actually  feasible,  as  assumed.   If  one  group  of
12:346:27022:17:17:72:540:319:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:countries wants a third not to use its currency, how is that achieved?  Countries who have dollarized can do
12:347:27130:17:17:72:540:302:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:so without the written consent of the US government.  If that is the case, it is not clear that complete exit
12:348:27239:17:30:72:226:285:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:from the Eurozone is even possible.
12:349:27274:30:23:72:193:255:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:C:3.2.2  Is Exit Credible?
12:350:27298:23:17:72:540:232:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:As suggested by these inequalities, steady state welfare is higher for all regions under Euroization compared to
12:351:27410:17:17:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:exit.  Thus, absent commitment, there are no incentives to force the exit of a country.  Instead, the countries
12:352:27521:17:17:72:540:198:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:would renegotiate and opt for Euroization, at least in the context of a debt crisis and this particular model
12:353:27630:17:16:72:264:181:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:of the costs and benefits of monetary union.
12:354:27674:16:17:86:539:165:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Beyond this model, there are additional political and economic costs which reinforce these arguments.  If
12:355:27779:17:17:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:exit entails the return to an original currency or the creation of a new one, there is the open question of how
12:356:27890:17:17:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to deal with resolving claims over existing assets.  Further, there is the added uncertainty over the value of
12:357:28000:17:16:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the new currency, which could be detrimental to all countries involved.  Finally there are the political cost of
12:358:28112:16:0:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:complete exit.  Again, if there were political gains to union in the first place, they all countries share these
13:359:28226:0:17:72:96:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:costs.
13:360:28232:17:16:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:As  indicated  by  these  arguments,  the  costs  of  exit  are  borne  byallparties.   So,  absent  commitment
13:361:28343:16:17:72:540:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to invoke this type of punishment, a threat of complete exit is not credible.  That is why the Euroization
13:362:28449:17:17:72:540:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:option dominates:  it is credible since the remaining countries have an incentive to enforce this punishment,
13:363:28558:17:17:72:539:620:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f8:B:WE> V∗,  and  the  defaulting  country  will  go  along  with  it  rather  than  choosing  to  exit  unilaterally,
13:364:28672:17:40:72:118:603:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f8:B:VE> VX.
13:365:28679:40:26:72:345:563:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:4  Debt Crisis: What is the outcome?
13:366:28715:26:17:72:540:537:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The stage is set for an evaluation of Euroization.  Using the options outlined above we study the outcome of
13:367:28823:17:17:72:192:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the game given in Figure 1.
13:368:28850:17:17:86:539:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The Ricardian equilibrium outlined above still exists in this expanded game.  If the region 1 debt is held
13:369:28956:17:16:72:540:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:entirely by region 1 agents, then theCBbe unwilling to bailout this debt and the region 1 government will
13:370:29061:16:17:72:152:470:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:choose to repay it.
13:371:29080:17:17:86:539:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:But,  the  focus  of  the  essay  is  on  the  role  of  the  exit  option  in  a  debt  crisis.   As  before,  there  can  be
13:372:29206:17:16:72:540:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:other  equilibria  in  which  repayment  by  region  1  does  not  occur.   The  (conjectured)  equilibrium  outcome
13:373:29322:16:17:72:540:420:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:is outlined in Figure 2.  This outcome is first described and then the arguments are provided for why the
13:374:29427:17:17:72:340:403:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:actions assumed in the construction are incentive compatible.
13:375:29488:17:17:86:539:386:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:There are  two,  distinct phases  to the response  of the  remaining governments,  regions 2  and 3,  to the
13:376:29596:17:16:72:540:369:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:situation in region 1.  Phase 1 is to determine an immediate response to the debt crisis:  allow default or
13:377:29703:16:17:72:410:353:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:bailout.  With fixed resources, this is a question about optimal redistribution.
13:378:29783:17:17:86:539:336:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Phase 2 is about subsequent punishment.  That is, regardless of whether there is default or bailout, the
13:379:29887:17:17:72:540:319:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:remaining countries have to decide the nature of their ongoing relationship with region 1.  The outcome of
13:380:29993:17:33:72:350:302:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:this phase must be consistent with the incentives of the parties.
13:381:30058:33:23:72:200:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:C:4.1  The Equilibrium
13:382:30078:23:17:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:In this conjectured equilibrium, after the regional government chooses not to levy taxes, the central author-
13:383:30187:17:17:72:540:229:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:ities (labeled the Central Bank) choose:  (i) to bailout the debt holders and (ii) to enforce Euroization.  To
13:384:30297:17:17:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:be clear, as indicated in Figure 2, the bailout and Euroization decisions are separately made.  It is possible
13:385:30407:17:16:72:445:195:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for either a bailout or a default to be followed either by Euroization or complete exit.
13:386:30495:16:17:86:539:179:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:For simplicity, the Euroization regime is viewed as permanent.  One advantage of Euroization is that a
13:387:30597:17:17:72:540:162:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:country could more easily regain full status in the monetary union after adequate fiscal reform.  This is made
13:388:30707:17:16:72:540:145:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:easier by the fact that the euro remains in use in region 1 during the Euroization period.  The more difficult
13:389:30817:16:17:72:540:129:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:part is to credibly define “adequate fiscal reform”.  Having an option to return to full status in the monetary
13:390:30928:17:17:72:486:112:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:union which is easier under Euroization would further support the outcome shown in Figure 2.
13:391:31020:17:0:86:539:95:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The payoffs along the equilibrium path are then computed as the sum of the payoffs from phase 1 plus
14:392:31122:0:17:72:540:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:those from phase 2.  The argument that this is an equilibrium proceeds by showing the Euroization is an
14:393:31225:17:16:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium in phase 2 and then, given this, using the arguments of consumption smoothing to determine
14:394:31327:16:31:72:276:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:whether a bailout or default occurs in phase 1.

14:405:31627:115:16:86:539:305:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:First  focus  on  Phase  2  of  this  game.   The  novel  feature  of  the  conjectured  equilibrium  is  the  use  of
14:406:31745:16:17:72:540:289:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Euroization.  This is  better from  the perspective  of the  governments of  regions 2  and 3  remaining in  the
14:407:31857:17:17:72:308:272:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:union than the other options of exit and continuation.
14:408:31911:17:17:86:539:255:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Previously we argued that from the perspective of the remaining members of the union Euroization was
14:409:32011:17:16:72:540:238:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:preferred to complete exit:WE> WX.  This inequality reflected the gains from maintaing the common
14:410:32108:16:17:72:540:222:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:currency and thus continuing to trade with region 1 without transactions costs and without legal disputes.
14:411:32214:17:17:72:540:205:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:Further, since the union members can impose an inflation tax on region 1, the Euroization regime can be
14:412:32317:17:17:72:329:188:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:better for them than the Ricardian benchmark:WE> V∗.
14:413:32369:17:16:86:539:171:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:If region 1 was to refuse to levy taxes to repay it outstanding debt, the remaining governments of regions
14:414:32475:16:17:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:2 and 3 would have an incentive for Euroization over the other options of continuation or exit.  This supports
14:415:32585:17:17:72:282:138:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the phase 2 outcome of the solution in Figure 2.
14:416:32633:17:17:86:539:121:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:What  about  the  conjectured  outcome  of  bailout  in  phase  1?   The  arguments  for  bailout  rather  than
14:417:32744:17:16:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:default  mimic  those  made  earlier.   If  consumption  smoothing  motives  are  strong  enough,  then  bailout  is
14:418:32860:16:0:72:160:88:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:preferred to default.
15:419:32883:0:17:86:540:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Since both the Exit and Euroization options are available regardless of the choice of theCBto bailout
15:420:32984:17:16:72:540:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:or not, these can be taken as independent decisions.  That is, the consumption smoothing argument, based
15:421:33088:16:17:72:518:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:on the dispersion of debt holdings, will guide the bailout decision.  The choice in Phase 2 then follows.
15:422:33193:17:17:86:539:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In sum, looking at the incentives of the remaining governments, if region 1 chooses not to tax its agents,
15:423:33299:17:17:72:540:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:these governments and theCBwill choose Euroization.  As long as the consumption smoothing argument is
15:424:33400:17:16:72:540:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:operative, this will entail a monetized bailout as well.  Here, as in Europe, the bailout is monetized in the
15:425:33509:16:17:72:229:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:absence of a central fiscal authority.
15:426:33547:17:17:86:539:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:Looking  further  up  the  game  tree  in  Figure  2  what  will  region  1  choose  to  do?   That  is,  anticipating
15:427:33665:17:17:72:325:553:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:bailout and Euroization, what is the response of region 1?
15:428:33723:17:16:86:539:536:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:If the cost of Euroization relative to the Ricardian steady state,V∗−VE, is large enough, the region 1
15:429:33825:16:17:72:540:520:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:will repay its debt even when some of it is held outside of the region.  In effect, the imposition of Euroization
15:430:33938:17:17:72:406:503:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:with an inflation tax increases the incentives for repayment of region 1 debt.
15:431:34016:17:17:86:539:486:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:It  does  so  by  creating  a  punishment  from  choosing  not  to  repay  it  debt.   From  Figure  2,  the  default
15:432:34133:17:16:72:540:469:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:cost ofκis irrelevant to the repayment decision of the region 1 government since default does not occur in
15:433:34239:16:17:72:540:453:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:equilibrium.  But the Euroization threat is credible and occurs in equilibrium.  This has an incentive effect
15:434:34348:17:17:72:310:436:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:on the repayment decision of the region 1 government.
15:435:34401:17:16:86:539:419:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:If region 1 will not levy a tax and defaults, the remaining governments will, as in Figure 2, bailout the
15:436:34506:16:17:72:540:403:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:debt of region 1 followed by Euroization.  As noted in Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010), the region 1 agents
15:437:34613:17:17:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:will be holding more money in a bailout equilibrium and thus pay a greater share of the inflation tax used
15:438:34719:17:17:72:158:369:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to fund the bailout.
15:439:34739:17:16:86:539:352:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In  this  case,  the  outcome  will  be  the  Euroization  steady  state  outlined  in  section  3.1.   This  outcome
15:440:34856:16:17:72:424:336:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:benefits regions 2 and 3 to the extent they collect an inflation tax from region 1.
15:441:34939:17:25:86:368:319:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This discussion can be summarized by the following proposition:
15:442:35002:25:17:72:540:294:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f13:C:Proposition 1If  enough  region1debt  is  held  outside  of  the  region,  then  there  is  an  equilibrium  in  which
15:443:35120:17:24:72:510:277:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f13:C:the regional government does not repay its debt and theCBresponds with a bailout and Euroization.
15:444:35217:24:17:72:539:253:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f8:B:Proof.Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010) prove that if the cost of default,κ, and the share of region 1
15:445:35317:17:17:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:debt held by region 1 agents are both small then the region 1 government chooses not to repay its debt and
15:446:35423:17:17:72:540:219:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:theCBwill provide a monetary bailout.  That proofs extends to this environment with three regions and
15:447:35524:17:16:72:330:202:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:arbitraryκas long as enough debt is held outside region 1.
15:448:35582:16:17:86:540:186:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The fact that Euroization is preferred by theCBover exit comes from the arguments made above that
15:449:35679:17:17:72:124:169:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f8:B:WE> WX.
15:450:35686:17:16:86:539:152:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:It is important to make clear the role of Euroization for this result.  The incentives for bailout come from
15:451:35794:16:17:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:consumption smoothing, independent of whether Euroization or Exit follow.  The role of Euroization is from
15:452:35900:17:17:72:539:119:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the incentive effects it creates on region 1.  Sinceκis not incurred in the bailout equilibrium, the region 1
15:453:36009:17:17:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:government is not punished through this channel for choosing not to repay its debt.  But under Euroization,
15:454:36116:17:0:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:sinceV∗> VE, the region 1 government is penalized for choosing not to repay its debt.  This punishment
16:455:36220:0:17:72:540:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:influences how much debt must be held by other regions before the region 1 government has an incentive
16:456:36322:17:16:72:539:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:not to repay its debt.  If the game was changed so thatκwas incurred if the region 1 government chose not
16:457:36427:16:34:71:346:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to repay, then Euroization would be an additional punishment.
16:458:36488:34:23:71:277:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:C:4.2  Further Response of Region1
16:459:36520:23:17:71:539:597:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:The  extensive  form  game  assumes  that  once  regions  2  and  3  decide  on  the  punishment,  it  is  followed  by
16:460:36639:17:17:71:539:580:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:region 1.  What would be the reaction of region 1 be?  Though in the extensive form game of Figure 2, region
16:461:36747:17:16:71:414:563:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:1 has no more options it is still useful to see the robustness of the equilibrium.
16:462:36829:16:17:86:539:547:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:As a final stage of the game, suppose region 1 had a choice between exit and Euroization.  We argued
16:463:36929:17:17:71:539:530:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:earlier that as long as the inflation tax imposed by regions 2 and 3 is not too severe, then Euroization will
16:464:37038:17:16:71:498:513:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:dominate exit:VE> VX.  Thus faced with this choice, region 1 would go along with Euroization.
16:465:37131:16:17:86:539:497:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This case is further strengthened by noting the political costs of exit.  As explained by Dor (2011), the
16:466:37236:17:17:71:539:480:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:only formal way to exit from the Eurozone is to exit from the EU. This is very costly to a government and
16:467:37341:17:17:71:330:463:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:thus further supports the outcome of Euroization over exit.
16:468:37400:17:16:86:539:446:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In the end, the actions prescribed in Figure 2 as the outcome of the game are consistent with the incentives
16:469:37508:16:17:71:539:430:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:of the parties involved.  The possibility of bailout remains but it is combined with Euroization rather than
16:470:37616:17:40:71:209:413:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:banishment from the Eurozone.
16:471:37645:40:27:71:172:373:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:5  Conclusion
16:472:37658:27:17:71:539:346:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:In the absence of a device to commitment to its choices, the member countries of a monetary union need
16:473:37760:17:16:71:539:329:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:to establish guidelines for dealing with debt crises.  The lack of a credible mechanism has been made clear
16:474:37867:16:17:71:539:313:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:by the ongoing dealings with Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy.  The Eurozone nations are searching for a
16:475:37974:17:17:71:227:296:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:mechanism to deal with debt crises.
16:476:38009:17:17:86:539:279:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The solution studied in this paper combines two elements: bailout and Euroization.  Absent commitment,
16:477:38111:17:16:71:539:262:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:member countries may ultimately be lead, following their joint interest, to bailout a member country.  This
16:478:38218:16:17:71:539:246:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:argument, following Cooper, Kempf, and Peled (2010) reflects a desire to smooth consumption among union
16:479:38321:17:17:71:113:229:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:members.
16:480:38329:17:17:86:539:212:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This essay further argues that a form of exit from a monetary union can be an effective tool for dealing
16:481:38433:17:16:71:539:195:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:with a debt crisis.  The exit device through Euroization is partial:  the country which exits retains the use of
16:482:38545:16:17:71:362:179:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the common currency but is eliminated from policy determination.
16:483:38609:17:17:86:539:162:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:This approach has the virtue of avoiding lengthy and costly procedures to determine debt obligations in
16:484:38712:17:16:71:452:145:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the face of a change in currencies.  In Euroization, the unit of account need not change.
16:485:38801:16:17:86:539:129:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:The  punishment  arises  by  exclusion  from  policy  determination.   A  country  cannot  be  prevented  from
16:486:38911:17:17:71:539:112:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:using the Euro but is prevented from participating in monetary policy decisions.  In the model studied here,
16:487:39019:17:0:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:this can lead to an inflation tax imposed on the excluded country.  This is just a modeling device to capture
17:488:39130:0:17:72:511:687:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:the various ways in which monetary policy can be conducted to the detriment of an outside country.
17:489:39228:17:16:86:539:670:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:There are two effects of Euroization.  First, a punishment for default of Euroization provides an incentive
17:490:39335:16:17:72:540:654:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:for a country to avoid default.  The fact that Euroization is credible supports this incentive role.  Second,
17:491:39444:17:17:72:540:637:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in the Euroization equilibrium, the countries remaining in the union can benefit from imposing an inflation
17:492:39551:17:17:72:272:620:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:tax on the region which defaulted on its debt.
17:493:39597:17:16:86:539:603:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:A:In the end, the outcome is both credible and effective.  It recognizes that ultimately countries will act
17:494:39702:16:17:72:540:587:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:in their joint interest,  threats and promises to the contrary notwithstanding.  Hence it is recognized that
17:495:39810:17:40:72:486:570:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:B:bailouts cannot be prevented but can be followed by credible punishment through Euroization.
