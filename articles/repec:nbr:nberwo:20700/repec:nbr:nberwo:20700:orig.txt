2:41:2665:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We model optimal fund turnover in the presence of time-varying profit opportunities. Our model 
2:42:2760:14:14:72:543:574:12:Times:12:Times:predicts a  positive  relation  between  an  active  fund’s  turnover  and  its  subsequent  benchmark-
2:43:2862:14:14:71:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:adjusted  return. We  find  such  a  relation  for  equity  mutual  funds.  This  time-series  relation 
2:44:2965:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:between  turnover  and  performance is  stronger  than  the  cross-sectional  relation,  as  the  model 
2:45:3068:14:14:72:542:532:12:Times:12:Times:predicts.  Also  as  predicted,  the  turnover-performance relation  is  stronger  for  funds  trading  less-
2:46:3176:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:liquid  stocks,  such  as  small-cap  funds.  Turnover  has  a  common component  that  is  positively 
2:47:3278:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:correlated  with  proxies  for  stock  mispricing,  consistent  with  funds  exploiting time-varying 
2:48:3378:14:28:71:424:490:12:Times:12:Times:opportunities. Turnover’s common component helps predict fund returns.

3:71:3907:0:41:72:209:723:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:1.  Introduction
3:72:3923:41:18:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mutual funds invest trillions of dollars on behalf of retail investors. The lion’s share of this
3:73:4019:18:18:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:money is actively managed, despite the growing popularity of passive investing.1Whether
3:74:4106:18:17:72:540:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:skill guides the trades of actively managed funds has long been an important question, given
3:75:4198:17:18:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:active funds’ higher fees and trading costs. We take a fresh look at skill by analyzing time
3:76:4290:18:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in active funds’ trading activity. We explore a simple idea: A fund trades more
3:77:4379:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when it perceives greater profit opportunities. If the fund has the ability to identify and
3:78:4470:18:29:72:526:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:exploit those opportunities, then it should earn greater profit after trading more heavily.
3:79:4561:29:18:89:540:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We formalize this idea by developing a model of fund trading in the presence of time-
3:80:4646:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:varying profit opportunities. Each period, funds identify opportunities to establish positions
3:81:4740:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that yield profits in the subsequent period, net of trading costs. A fund’s optimal amount
3:82:4830:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of turnover maximizes its expected net profit, conditional on equilibrium prices.  Profit
3:83:4919:18:18:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opportunities vary over time, jointly determining turnover and performance. A fund trades
3:84:5008:18:18:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more in periods when it has more profit opportunities. Our model’s key implication is a
3:85:5095:18:28:72:516:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive time-series relation between optimally chosen turnover and subsequent return.
3:86:5181:28:18:89:540:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Consistent with the model, we find that a fund’s turnover positively predicts the fund’s
3:87:5269:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:subsequent benchmark-adjusted return. This new evidence of skill comes from our sample
3:88:5355:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of 3,126 active U.S. equity mutual funds from 1979 through 2011. The result is significant
3:89:5445:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not only statistically but also economically: a one-standard-deviation increase in turnover is
3:90:5539:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:associated with a 0.65% per year increase in performance for the typical fund. Funds seem
3:91:5628:18:29:72:276:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to know when it’s a good time to trade.
3:92:5667:29:18:89:539:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We focus on the time-series relation between turnover and performance for a given fund.
3:93:5754:18:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In contrast, prior studies ask whether there is a turnover-performance relation across funds.
3:94:5847:18:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The evidence on this cross-sectional relation is mixed. For example, Elton, Gruber, Das, and
3:95:5939:18:17:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Hlavka (1993) and Carhart (1997) find a negative relation, Wermers (2000), Kacperczyk,
3:96:6025:17:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Sialm, and Zheng (2005), and Edelen, Evans, and Kadlec (2007) find no significant relation,
3:97:6116:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Dahlquist, Engstr ̈om and S ̈oderlind (2000) and Chen, Jagadeesh and Wermers (2001)
3:98:6203:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:find a positive relation.  In accord with this mixed message, our sample delivers a weak
3:99:6291:18:29:72:391:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive cross-sectional relation, marginally significant at best.
3:100:6357:29:18:89:540:137:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Consistent with the empirical results, our model predicts that the time-series relation
3:101:6444:18:18:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between turnover and performance should be stronger than the cross-sectional relation. The
3:102:6534:18:15:85:540:101:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:1As of 2013, mutual funds worldwide have about $30 trillion of assets under management, half of which
3:103:6635:15:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:is managed by U.S. funds. About 52% of U.S. mutual fund assets are held in equity funds, and 81.6% of the
3:104:6740:12:0:72:467:74:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:equity funds’ total net assets are managed actively (Investment Company Institute, 2014).
4:105:6830:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:reason is that a given trade’s cost reduces current return, whereas its profit increases future
4:106:6925:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:return. Trading costs therefore do not dampen the time-series turnover-performance relation
4:107:7016:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as much as they dampen the cross-sectional relation, where the timing of profit and trading
4:108:7107:18:29:72:160:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost is irrelevant.
4:109:7126:29:18:89:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our model also predicts that funds trading less-liquid stocks should have a stronger time-
4:110:7216:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:series relation between turnover and performance. The turnover of such funds optimally
4:111:7302:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:responds less to profit opportunities, so a given change in turnover implies a greater change
4:112:7395:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in profit opportunities. Consistent with this prediction, we find that funds holding stocks
4:113:7486:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of small companies, or small-cap funds, have a significantly stronger turnover-performance
4:114:7576:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation than do large-cap funds. Similarly, we find a stronger relation for small funds than
4:115:7669:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:large funds, consistent with the ability of smaller funds to trade less-liquid stocks, given that
4:116:7766:18:29:72:308:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:smaller funds trade in smaller dollar amounts.
4:117:7812:29:18:89:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find a stronger turnover-performance relation as well for funds charging higher fees.
4:118:7900:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This result has a skill-based interpretation, under the plausible assumption that funds with
4:119:7992:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:greater skill charge higher fees. If a less-skilled fund trades on profit opportunities that are
4:120:8088:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not really there, then some of the fund’s turnover is unrelated to expected future return.
4:121:8178:18:28:72:459:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The turnover-performance relation is therefore weaker for less-skilled funds.
4:122:8255:28:18:89:540:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find strong evidence of commonality in fund turnover.  Turnover’s common com-
4:123:8335:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ponent appears to be related to mispricing in the stock market. Average turnover across
4:124:8422:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds—essentially the first principal component of turnover—is significantly related to three
4:125:8515:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:proxies for potential mispricing: investor sentiment, cross-sectional dispersion in individual
4:126:8609:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stock returns, and aggregate stock market liquidity. Funds trade more when sentiment or
4:127:8696:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:dispersion is high or liquidity is low, suggesting that stocks are more mispriced when funds
4:128:8788:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:collectively perceive greater profit opportunities. We also find that commonality in turnover
4:129:8881:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is especially high among funds sharing similar characteristics, suggesting more comovement
4:130:8971:18:29:72:293:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in profit opportunities across similar funds.
4:131:9016:29:17:89:539:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Average turnover positively predicts a fund’s future return, even when we control for the
4:132:9105:17:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s own turnover. This predictive relation is significant: a one-standard-deviation increase
4:133:9200:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in average turnover is associated with a 0.71% per year increase in fund performance. The
4:134:9289:18:29:72:514:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation is even stronger when average turnover is computed only across similar funds.
4:135:9375:29:18:89:539:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The predictive ability of average turnover is consistent with the presence of error in our
4:136:9465:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:empirical measure of an individual fund’s turnover. This measure aims to exclude trades aris-
4:137:9558:18:18:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ing from a fund’s inflows and outflows, thereby reflecting only trades arising from the fund’s
4:138:9652:18:0:72:540:77:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:decisions to replace some stocks with others, but this objective can be accomplished only
5:139:9742:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:imperfectly. The common component of individual fund turnover—average turnover—helps
5:140:9826:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:capture a fund’s true turnover and thus helps to predict the fund’s performance. Measure-
5:141:9915:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ment error can also explain our finding that a fund’s performance is predicted even more
5:142:10003:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:strongly by the average turnover of similar funds. Since commonality in turnover is greater
5:143:10094:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:among similar funds, average turnover of similar funds is particularly useful in capturing a
5:144:10186:18:28:72:372:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s true turnover in the presence of measurement error.
5:145:10244:28:18:89:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Average turnover should also predict returns if funds trade suboptimally in that only a
5:146:10331:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:portion of their trading exploits true profit opportunities. If those opportunities are cor-
5:147:10423:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:related across funds while funds’ trading mistakes are not, then higher average turnover
5:148:10511:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:indicates greater profit opportunities in general. Any opportunity identified by a given fund
5:149:10604:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is likely to be more profitable if there is generally more mispricing at that time, as indicated
5:150:10700:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by other funds’ heavy trading. Suboptimal trading can also explain the superior predictive
5:151:10790:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:power of similar funds’ average turnover, as that turnover reflects especially relevant profit
5:152:10884:18:29:72:305:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opportunities—those shared by similar funds.
5:153:10928:29:18:89:539:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The literature investigating the skill of active mutual funds is extensive. Average past
5:154:11016:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance delivers a seemingly negative verdict, since many studies show that active funds
5:155:11108:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:have underperformed passive benchmarks, net of fees.2Yet active funds can have skill.
5:156:11193:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Skilled funds might charge higher fees, and some funds might be more skilled than others.
5:157:11282:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Moreover, with fund-level or industry-level decreasing returns to scale, skill does not equate
5:158:11376:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to average performance, either gross or net of fees.3Our finding of a significant positive
5:159:11466:17:29:72:516:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time-series relation between turnover and performance provides novel evidence of skill.
5:160:11553:29:18:89:540:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While we find that funds perform better after increasing their trading activity, others
5:161:11640:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:have related fund activity to performance in different ways. Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng
5:162:11729:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2005) find that funds that are more active in the sense of having more concentrated port-
5:163:11819:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:folios perform better. Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008) find that a fund’s actions be-
5:164:11908:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tween portfolio disclosure dates, as summarized by the “return gap,” positively predict fund
5:165:12000:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance. Cremers and Petajisto (2009) find that funds that deviate more from their
5:166:12086:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:benchmarks, as measured by “active share,” perform better. Cremers, Ferreira, Matos, and
5:167:12174:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Starks (2016) find similar results. In the same spirit, Amihud and Goyenko (2013) find bet-
5:168:12265:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ter performance among funds having lower R-squareds from benchmark regressions. These
5:169:12350:18:17:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:studies are similar to ours in that they also find that more active funds perform better, but
5:170:12443:17:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:there are two important differences. First, all of these studies measure fund activity in ways
5:171:12537:18:16:85:540:117:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:2See, for example, Jensen (1968), Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (1993), Malkiel (1995), Gruber (1996),
5:172:12640:16:8:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Carhart (1997), Wermers (2000), P ́astor and Stambaugh (2002), and Fama and French (2010), among others.
5:173:12744:8:16:85:540:93:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:3See Berk and Green (2004), P ́astor and Stambaugh (2012), Stambaugh (2014), Berk and van Binsbergen
5:174:12844:16:0:72:296:77:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(2015), and P ́astor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015).
6:175:12896:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:different from ours. Second, all of them identify cross-sectional relations between activity
6:176:12988:18:29:72:385:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and performance, whereas we establish a time-series relation.
6:177:13049:29:18:89:540:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Given this time-series perspective, our study is also related to the literature on time
6:178:13136:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in mutual fund performance. Some authors, inspired by Ferson and Schadt (1996),
6:179:13225:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model performance as a linear function of conditioning variables (e.g., Avramov and Wer-
6:180:13313:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mers, 2006). Others relate fund performance to the business cycle (e.g., Moskowitz, 2000,
6:181:13402:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Glode, 2011, Kosowski, 2011, and Kacperczyk, van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp, 2016),
6:182:13485:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to aggregate market returns (Glode, Hollifield, Kacperczyk, and Kogan, 2012), and to time
6:183:13574:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in fund risk (e.g., Brown, Harlow, and Starks, 1996, and Huang, Sialm, and Zhang,
6:184:13665:18:29:72:435:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2011). None of these studies relate fund performance to fund turnover.
6:185:13735:29:18:89:539:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While we analyze funds’ ability to time their turnover, others have investigated the
6:186:13819:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:value of active fund management by examining different fund actions.  Chen, Jegadeesh,
6:187:13905:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Wermers (2000) find that stocks recently bought by funds in aggregate outperform
6:188:13989:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stocks recently sold, suggesting that funds have stock-picking skill. Baker et al. (2010) find
6:189:14083:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that much of this outperformance takes place around corporate earnings announcements,
6:190:14168:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:indicating one likely source of the funds’ skill. Cohen, Coval, and P ́astor (2005) find that
6:191:14261:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds whose portfolio decisions are similar to those of other funds with strong track records
6:192:14354:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:perform better. Alexander, Cici, and Gibson (2007) show that funds’ valuation-motivated
6:193:14441:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:buys (i.e., large stock buys concurrent with heavy fund outflows) outperform benchmarks
6:194:14528:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whereas liquidity-motivated buys do not. Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy (2008) find that fund
6:195:14618:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:managers perform better when they trade shares of firms they are connected to through
6:196:14703:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:their educational networks. Like us, all of these studies report that active management adds
6:197:14795:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:value, but they examine different dimensions of fund skill. Our finding that funds are able
6:198:14886:18:29:72:429:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to successfully time their trading activity seems new in the literature.
6:199:14958:29:18:89:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Lastly, our analysis of the common variation in fund turnover is related to the literature
6:200:15048:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on correlated trading behavior of mutual funds, or “herding.” Early studies include Nofsinger
6:201:15141:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Sias (1999) and Wermers (1999). More recently, Koch, Ruenzi, and Starks (2016) and
6:202:15227:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012) argue that such correlated trading gives rise to common-
6:203:15317:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ality in liquidity among stocks. Commonality in individual stock turnover is analyzed by Lo
6:204:15408:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Wang (2000), Cremers and Mei (2007), and others. None of these studies examine fund
6:205:15495:18:28:72:461:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover. Our analysis of the common component of fund turnover is novel.
6:206:15568:28:18:89:540:124:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model, which implies
6:207:15658:18:18:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a positive relation between a fund’s turnover and subsequent return.  Section 3 reports
6:208:15745:18:0:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:strong evidence of such a relation in our mutual fund sample and, in the context of our
7:209:15833:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model, contrasts the time-series relation with the weaker cross-sectional relation. Section
7:210:15924:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:4 explores differences in the strength of the time-series relation across categories of funds
7:211:16017:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:differentiated by size, fees, and investment styles. Section 5 analyzes the common component
7:212:16109:18:43:72:479:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of fund turnover and its predictive power for fund returns. Section 6 concludes.
7:213:16189:43:40:72:486:626:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:2.  Model of the Turnover-Performance Relation
7:214:16235:40:18:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this section we present a simple model of optimal fund turnover in the presence of
7:215:16320:18:18:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time-varying profit opportunities. A manager trades more when he identifies more alpha-
7:216:16407:18:18:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:producing opportunities, so a skilled manager should perform better after he trades more.
7:217:16496:18:18:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The model implies a positive turnover-performance relation: a time-series regression in which
7:218:16589:18:44:72:432:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a fund’s turnover is positively related to the fund’s subsequent return.
7:219:16661:44:37:72:389:470:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:2.1  Profit Opportunities and Trading Costs
7:220:16704:37:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Active mutual funds pursue alpha—profit in excess of their benchmarks. A fund perceives
7:221:16791:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opportunities for producing alpha and trades to exploit them. LetXtdenote a given level
7:222:16878:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of turnover that the fund can choose in periodt. LetP(Xt) denote the resulting expected
7:223:16965:18:18:72:539:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:benchmark-adjusted profit (alpha) in periodt+ 1, before fees and trading costs, if the fund
7:224:17056:18:17:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:makes optimal buy-sell decisions conditional on its turnover beingXt. The profit represented
7:225:17148:17:18:72:539:344:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:byP(Xt) reflects the fund’s ability to exploit opportunities in periodtfor which the payoff
7:226:17239:18:18:72:539:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:occurs in periodt+ 1. A prime example is a purchase of underpriced securities in periodt
7:227:17327:18:29:72:376:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:followed by the correction of the mispricing in periodt+ 1.
7:228:17386:29:18:89:540:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If the fund wishes to maintain a well diversified portfolio of stocks, the fund is likely to
7:229:17478:18:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:replace more of its stocks whenXtis high than whenXtis low. As the fund moves further
7:230:17563:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:down its list of potential stocks to buy, the alphas on the additional stocks are likely to be
7:231:17657:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower than those on stocks higher up the fund’s list. As a result,P(Xt) is likely to be concave
7:232:17752:18:23:72:331:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inXt. We represent this concave profit function as
7:233:17802:23:24:262:540:184:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:P(Xt) =πtX1−θt,(1)
7:234:17820:24:17:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:where 0< θ <1. Variation over time in the fund’s profit opportunities is summarized by
7:235:17906:17:29:72:503:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the parameterπt. The higher isπt, the more profitable are the fund’s opportunities.
7:236:17989:29:18:89:539:114:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:LetC(Xt) denote the trading cost in periodtincurred by the fund as a result of turning
7:237:18075:18:24:72:406:96:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:overXtin that period. We represent the trading cost function as

8:240:18243:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost of trading a given stock is convex in the amount of that stock traded (e.g., Kyle and

8:242:18421:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more of any given stock, we would expect some convexity inC(Xt). On the other hand, if a

8:244:18598:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as opposed to trading a greater amount of any given stock, thenC(Xt) should be close to

8:246:18771:18:45:72:465:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:consistent with our empirical evidence on the turnover-performance relation.

8:248:18868:36:18:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The fund’s chosen level of turnover maximizes expected next-period profit net of the current
8:249:18960:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trading cost incurred to produce that profit. We assume that the fund maximizes this after-
8:250:19051:18:18:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost profit before subtracting fees charged to investors.4Recall thatP(Xt) in equation (1)
8:251:19141:18:29:72:501:462:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is profit before both fees and trading costs. The fund’s choice ofXttherefore solves

8:264:19432:33:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We see that the fund trades more when its profit opportunities are better (i.e., whenπtis
8:265:19521:18:28:72:502:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher). Also, higher trading costs (c) imply less trading. Both results are intuitive.
8:266:19608:28:18:89:540:232:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When the fund decides how much to trade, it conditions on equilibrium prices. We do
8:267:19691:18:18:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not model the formation of equilibrium prices, which reflect the joint effects of all funds’
8:268:19783:18:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trading. Instead, we rely on a simple point: Whatever the price formation process, if equi-
8:269:19874:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:librium prices do not offer the fund a higher net profit at the fund’s chosen level of turnover
8:270:19969:18:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than at any other level of turnover, then the fund is not optimizing. When specifying the
8:271:20058:18:18:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s optimization problem in equation (3), we assume there are many funds and that any
8:272:20146:18:18:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:individual fund takes equilibrium prices—and thus its own after-cost profit opportunities—
8:273:20236:18:18:72:539:106:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as given when deciding how much to trade. In other words,C(Xt) does not represent price
8:274:20323:18:16:85:540:88:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:4One justification for this assumption is that a higher profit before fees essentially provides the fund with
8:275:20432:16:0:72:515:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:a higher fee, if fund flows result in zero net alpha provided to investors, as in Berk and Green (2004).

10:358:24156:18:30:72:539:156:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower than the slope of the time-series relation,b. Specifically, from equations (13) and (15),
10:359:24251:30:30:261:540:126:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:b−h=c(1−ρ),(16)
10:360:24266:30:18:72:540:96:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which is positive.  The time-series slope is greater because trading costs associated with
10:361:24356:18:0:72:540:78:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover do not subtract from the fund’s return in the same period as the profit resulting
11:362:24447:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from that turnover. In contrast, the timing of profit and trading cost is irrelevant for the
11:363:24539:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cross-sectional relation. Trading costs therefore weaken the time-series turnover-performance
11:364:24632:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation by less than they weaken the cross-sectional relation. The empirical results in the
11:365:24724:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:next section are consistent with the model’s implied difference between the time-series and
11:366:24815:18:43:72:302:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cross-sectional slopes, given in equation (16).
11:367:24862:43:37:72:503:608:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:3.  Estimating the Turnover-Performance Relation
11:368:24910:37:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Following equation (11), we specify the time-series turnover-performance relation for a given
11:369:25003:18:30:72:223:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fundias the linear regression

11:371:25058:30:18:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whereRi,tis the fund’s benchmark-adjusted return in periodt, andXi,t−1is the fund’s
11:372:25141:18:18:72:539:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover in periodt−1. As implied by our model, a positivebireflects the fund’s skill to
11:373:25229:18:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:identify and trade on opportunities in periodt−1 for which a significant portion of the payoff
11:374:25323:18:18:72:539:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:occurs in periodt. One can imagine other forms of skill, outside of the model, that we would
11:375:25415:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:not detect. For example, a fund could have skill to identify short-horizon opportunities,
11:376:25504:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:such as liquidity provision, that deliver all of their profits in periodt−1.7Or a fund could
11:377:25596:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:identify only long-horizon opportunities that bear fruit after periodt. Moreover, detecting
11:378:25687:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:skill using the turnover-performance relation requires time variation in the extent to which
11:379:25779:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:profit opportunities arise, i.e., variation inπtin equation (1). Although the regression in
11:380:25870:18:17:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equation (17) cannot detect all forms of skill, it nevertheless provides novel insights into the
11:381:25966:17:29:72:443:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ability of funds to identify and exploit time-varying profit opportunities.
11:382:26041:29:18:89:539:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We explore the turnover-performance relation using the dataset constructed by P ́astor,
11:383:26128:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015), who combine CRSP and Morningstar data to obtain a sample
11:384:26214:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of 3,126 actively managed U.S. domestic equity mutual funds covering the 1979–2011 period.
11:385:26304:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To measure the dependent variableRi,t, we follow the above study in usingGrossRi,t, the
11:386:26391:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s net return minus the return on the benchmark index designated by Morningstar, plus
11:387:26480:18:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the fund’s monthly expense ratio taken from CRSP. Following our model, we use gross return,
11:388:26571:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:i.e., the return before fees charged to investors. We estimate all regressions at a monthly
11:389:26662:18:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:frequency, but a fund’s turnover is reported only as the total for its fiscal year. Thus, we
11:390:26754:18:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure turnover,Xi,t−1, by the variableF undT urni,t−1, which is the fund’s turnover for
11:391:26843:18:16:85:540:123:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:7In the presence of skill, a higherXi,t−1can contribute positively to bothRi,t−1andRi,t. Thus, one might
11:392:26947:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:also look for a positive contemporaneous relation between turnover and return. Such a relation, however,
11:393:27051:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:could simply reflect a manager’s trading in reaction to return, thereby confounding an inference about skill.
11:394:27160:12:0:72:440:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:We therefore focus on the predictive turnover-performance relation in equation (17).

12:401:27481:18:18:72:540:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fiscal year that ends before montht, and the denominator is the fund’s average total net
12:402:27569:18:18:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:asset value over the same 12-month period. We have no discretion over this definition; this
12:403:27660:18:17:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the measure of turnover that funds are required to report to the SEC, and it is also the
12:404:27751:17:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure provided by CRSP. We discuss some properties of this measure later in Section
12:405:27836:18:29:72:416:575:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:3.2.1. We winsorizeF undT urni,t−1at the 1st and 99th percentiles.
12:406:27902:29:18:89:540:546:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To increase the power of our inferences in equation (17), we estimate a panel regression
12:407:27990:18:18:72:214:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that imposes the restriction

12:409:28035:23:18:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Initially we pool across all funds, and then later we pool within various fund categories when

12:412:28312:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund fixed effects correspond to theai’s in equation (17) when the restriction in (19) is im-
12:413:28405:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:posed across all funds. The regression specification combining equations (17) and (19), which
12:414:28498:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:isolates the time-series relation between turnover and performance, is our main specification.
12:415:28592:18:45:72:447:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For comparison, we also consider other specifications, as we explain next.

12:417:28716:36:18:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 1 reports the estimated slope coefficient on turnover, or̂b,for various specifications of
12:418:28811:18:18:72:539:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:the panel regression capturing the turnover-performance relation. The top left cell reportŝb
12:419:28904:18:27:72:427:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from our main specification, which combines equations (17) and (19):

12:421:28997:26:18:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This specification includes fund fixed effects, so the OLS estimatêbreflects only time-series
12:422:29091:18:18:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variation in turnover and performance. This statement emerges clearly from the fact that,
12:423:29180:18:18:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with fund fixed effects,̂bis a weighted average across funds of the slope estimates from
12:424:29268:18:18:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund-by-fund time-series regressions.  The weighting scheme places larger weights on the
12:425:29356:18:18:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:time-series slopes of funds with more observations as well as funds whose turnover fluctuates
12:426:29449:18:29:72:307:119:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more over time. See the Appendix for details.
12:427:29494:29:18:89:539:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The estimatêbin the top left cell of Table 1 is positive and highly significant, with a
12:428:29582:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:t-statistic of 6.63. This finding of a positive turnover-performance relation in the time series
13:429:29680:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is the main empirical result of the paper. The relation is significant not only statistically but
13:430:29777:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:also economically. The average within-fund standard deviation ofXi,t−1is 0.438. Therefore,
13:431:29867:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the estimated slope of 0.00123 implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in a fund’s
13:432:29956:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f11:turnover translates to an increase in annualized expected return of 0.65% (= 0.00123×
13:433:30041:18:18:72:539:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:0.438×1200). This number is substantial, in that it is comparable in magnitude to funds’
13:434:30129:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:overall average annualizedRi,t, equal to 0.60%. In other words, conditioning fund returns
13:435:30218:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on turnover implies fluctuations in the conditional expected return that are of first-order
13:436:30309:18:28:72:452:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economic importance, often as large as the unconditional expected return.
13:437:30382:28:18:89:539:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The top right cell of Table 1 reportŝbfrom a panel regression that includes both fund
13:438:30468:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and month fixed effects. The resulting estimate, 0.00106, is only slightly smaller than its
13:439:30559:18:18:72:539:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:counterpart in the top left cell, and it is similarly significant (t= 6.77). The only differ-
13:440:30652:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ence from the top left cell is the addition of month fixed effects. This addition controls for
13:441:30746:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:any unobserved variables that change over time but not across funds, such as macroeco-
13:442:30832:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nomic variables, regulatory changes, and aggregate trading activity. Since the results with
13:443:30923:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and without month fixed effects are so similar, such aggregate variables cannot explain the
13:444:31014:18:29:72:340:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive relation between turnover and performance.
13:445:31065:29:18:89:539:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The bottom left cell reportŝbwhen no fixed effects are included in the panel regression.
13:446:31154:18:24:72:398:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:This specification imposes not only the restriction (19) but also

13:448:31236:24:18:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:By removing fund fixed effects from our main specification, this additional restriction brings
13:449:31330:18:18:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cross-sectional variation into play when estimatingb.  The estimatêbin the bottom left
13:450:31417:18:18:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cell of Table 1 thus reflects both cross-sectional and time-series variation. This estimate is
13:451:31511:18:29:72:454:294:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive, 0.00040, but only marginally significant, with at-statistic of 1.92.

13:456:31854:18:18:72:539:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:turnover and performance.  To see this, note that including month fixed effects makeŝb
13:457:31941:18:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:equal to a weighted average across periods of the slope estimates from period-by-period
13:458:32028:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cross-sectional regressions of performance on turnover. The weighting scheme places larger
13:459:32118:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:weights on periods with more observations and periods in which the independent variable ex-
13:460:32209:18:18:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:hibits more cross-sectional variance. If each period receives the same weight, then this panel
13:461:32303:18:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:regression produces the same slope coefficient as the well known Fama-Macbeth (1973) esti-
13:462:32393:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mator. (See the Appendix.) The estimate ofbfrom equation (22), 0.00030, is positive but the
14:463:32486:0:18:72:539:723:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:t-statistic is only 1.61. The point estimate is smaller than in the bottom left cell, which shows
14:464:32583:18:29:72:532:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that isolating cross-sectional variation further weakens the turnover-performance relation.
14:465:32674:29:18:89:540:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 1 clearly shows that the turnover-performance relation is stronger in the time
14:466:32758:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:series than in the cross section. Recall from our model that we expect such a result, with
14:467:32848:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the difference between the time-series and cross-sectional slopes given by equation (16). In
14:468:32940:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fact, the difference between these slopes in Table 1 is roughly in line with equation (16),
14:469:33031:17:18:72:539:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:given estimates ofρandc. Forρ, we take the average autocorrelation ofF undT urni,t−1,
14:470:33116:18:18:72:539:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which is equal to 0.507. Forc, we turn to Edelen, Evans, and Kadlec (2013), who report
14:471:33202:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that, on average, the equity mutual funds in their sample have annual turnover of 82.4%
14:472:33289:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and incur 1.44% of fund value annually in trading costs.  The implied value ofcis then
14:473:33375:18:18:72:539:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:0.0144/0.824 = 0.0175.  From equation (16), the difference between the time-series and
14:474:33461:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:cross-sectional slopes is then equal toc(1−ρ) = 0.0175(1−0.507) = 0.0086. Given thatρ
14:475:33546:18:18:72:539:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:andcare annual quantities, this value is the implied difference in slopes when annual return
14:476:33638:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is regressed on annual turnover. Table 1 instead reports slopes for monthly return regressed
14:477:33730:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on 12-month turnover. Multiplying the latter slopes by 12 puts them roughly on a 12-month
14:478:33819:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:basis. Subtracting the cross-sectional slope in the lower-right cell of Table 1 from the time-
14:479:33913:18:18:72:539:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:series slope in the upper-left cell, multiplying by 12, gives 12(0.00123−0.00030) = 0.0112,
14:480:34004:18:29:72:430:407:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:which rounds to 0.01, just like the above implied difference of 0.0086.8
14:481:34076:29:18:89:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In sum, consistent with our model in which fund managers identify and exploit time-
14:482:34159:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:varying profit opportunities, a fund’s performance exhibits a highly significant positive rela-
14:483:34254:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion to its lagged turnover. As our model also predicts, this time-series relation is stronger
14:484:34348:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than the weakly positive cross-sectional relation between turnover and performance. More-
14:485:34437:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:over, the magnitude of the difference between the time-series and cross-sectional slopes con-
14:486:34530:18:46:72:197:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:forms well to our model.
14:487:34554:46:36:72:189:243:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:3.2.  Robustness
14:488:34570:36:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The positive turnover-performance relation documented above, which is our main result, is
14:489:34659:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:robust to a variety of specification changes. We summarize the robustness results here and
14:490:34749:18:29:72:482:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:report them in detail in the online appendix, which is available on our websites.
14:491:34830:29:18:89:539:142:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We have already shown that the turnover-performance relation obtains whether or not
14:492:34913:18:17:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:month fixed effects are included in the panel regression, which rules out all aggregate variables
14:493:35010:17:16:85:540:107:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:8The time-series and cross-sectional slopes when 12-month return is regressed on 12-month turnover equal
14:494:35114:16:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:0.0200 and 0.0107, as reported in the online appendix. The difference in these slopes, 0.0093, is also quite
14:495:35222:12:0:72:276:79:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:close to the above implied difference of 0.0086.
15:496:35272:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as the source of this relation. Furthermore, the relation obtains when we include benchmark-
15:497:35364:18:18:72:539:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:month fixed effects, ruling out any variables measured at the benchmark-month level.9An
15:498:35451:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:example of such a variable is benchmark turnover, which can be reflected in a fund’s turnover
15:499:35544:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to the extent that some of the fund’s trading passively responds to reconstitutions of the
15:500:35634:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s benchmark index. Adding benchmark-month fixed effects has a tiny effect on the
15:501:35719:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimated turnover-performance relation, strengthening our interpretation of this relation as
15:502:35812:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:being driven by skilled active trading. The relation also obtains, and is equally strong, when
15:503:35906:18:28:72:311:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gross fund returns are replaced by net returns.
15:504:35953:28:18:89:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Importantly, the positive turnover-performance relation doesnotobtain in a placebo test
15:505:36040:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in which we replace active funds by passive index funds, as identified by Morningstar. When
15:506:36131:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we produce the counterpart of Table 1 for the universe of passive funds, we find no slope
15:507:36220:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient significantly different from zero. In fact, the estimated slope coefficients in the
15:508:36315:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:specifications with fund fixed effects are not even positive (the correspondingt-statistics in
15:509:36409:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the top row of Table 1 are -0.51 and -1.07). This result is comforting because passive funds
15:510:36501:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should not exhibit any skill in identifying time-varying profit opportunities. The fact that
15:511:36593:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the turnover-performance relation emerges for active funds but not passive funds supports
15:512:36682:18:29:72:303:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our skill-based interpretation of this relation.
15:513:36730:29:18:89:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If a fund’s turnover is negatively correlated with the fund’s contemporaneous or lagged
15:514:36817:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:return, then a finite sample tends to produce a positive sample correlation between return
15:515:36907:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and lagged turnover even if this correlation’s true value is zero. This bias, essentially the same
15:516:37005:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as analyzed by Stambaugh (1999), arises because the sample’s relatively high (low) turnover
15:517:37096:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:values tend to be accompanied by the sample’s low (high) current and past returns. Those
15:518:37184:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:high (low) turnover values thus tend to precede the sample’s relatively high (low) returns,
15:519:37275:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thereby producing an apparent positive relation between return and lagged turnover. We
15:520:37361:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:find that the correlations between turnover and both contemporaneous and lagged return
15:521:37447:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are negative but statistically insignificant. We nevertheless conduct a simulation analysis to
15:522:37541:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gauge the potential magnitude of the bias as well as the effectiveness of a simple remedy in
15:523:37633:18:18:72:539:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our setting—addingRi,t−1andRi,t−2as independent variables to the regression in equation
15:524:37720:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(20). The simulation reveals that the finite-sample bias is very small and that adding the
15:525:37810:18:18:72:539:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lagged returns is nevertheless effective in eliminating it. When we addRi,t−1andRi,t−2to
15:526:37898:18:28:72:539:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the regression in (20), the resulting slope onXi,t−1and itst-statistic are virtually unchanged.
15:527:37993:28:18:89:539:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We estimate the turnover-performance relation at the monthly frequency. Even though
15:528:38076:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds report their turnover only annually, most of the variables used in our subsequent
15:529:38163:18:16:85:540:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:9Gormley and Matsa (2014), among others, advocate the use of a fixed-effects estimator as a way of
15:530:38261:16:0:72:379:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:controlling for unobserved group heterogeneity in finance applications.
16:531:38334:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:analysis, such as fund returns, fund size, industry size, sentiment, volatility, liquidity, and
16:532:38429:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:business-cycle indicators, are available on a monthly basis. Therefore, we choose the monthly
16:533:38522:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:frequency in an effort to utilize all available information. Nonetheless, when we reestimate
16:534:38614:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the turnover-performance relation by using annual fund returns, we find a positive and highly
16:535:38707:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significant time-series relation, just like in Table 1. In addition, we consider a specification
16:536:38803:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that allows the slope coefficient from the monthly turnover-performance regression to depend
16:537:38895:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:on the number of months between the end of the 12-month period over whichF undT urn
16:538:38978:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is measured and the month in which the fund return is computed. Specifically, we add a
16:539:39064:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:term to the right-hand side of the regression that interacts the above number of months with
16:540:39156:18:17:72:539:561:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:F undT urn. We find that the interaction term does not enter significantly, suggesting that
16:541:39247:17:29:72:310:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our constant-slope specification is appropriate.
16:542:39295:29:18:89:539:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To judge the statistical significance of the turnover-performance slope estimates in the
16:543:39383:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:presence of fund fixed effects, we compute standard errors clustered by sector times month,
16:544:39474:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:where sector denotes a Morningstar style category. We choose this approach because there is
16:545:39565:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mild correlation between benchmark-adjusted fund returns within the same sector but very
16:546:39653:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:little across sectors. For robustness, we also consider stricter clustering schemes, namely, by
16:547:39748:18:29:72:449:425:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:month, and by fund and month, and continue to find significant results.10
16:548:39821:29:18:89:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our turnover-performance relation captures the predictive power ofF undT urnin a given
16:549:39907:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fiscal year for fund performance in the following fiscal year (e.g., turnover in 2014 predicts
16:550:40001:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:returns in 2015). In principle, some fund trades could take longer to play out (e.g., a trade in
16:551:40097:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2014 could lead to profits in 2016).11To test for such long-horizon effects, we add two more
16:552:40189:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lags ofF undT urnto the right-hand side of regression (20). We find that neither of those
16:553:40278:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:additional lags has any predictive power for returns after controlling for the most recent
16:554:40368:18:18:72:539:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:value ofF undT urn, which retains its positive and significant coefficient. Therefore, we use
16:555:40461:18:29:72:375:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:only the most recentF undT urnin the rest of our analysis.
16:556:40519:29:18:89:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our results are not driven by manager changes. When we replace fund fixed effects by
16:557:40603:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund-manager fixed effects, the results are very similar. The turnover-performance relation
16:558:40694:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thus holds not only at the fund level but also at the manager level. One implication is that
16:559:40786:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our results are not driven by portfolio turnover during manager transitions. In addition, our
16:560:40879:18:17:72:497:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results easily survive the addition of controls for manager age and manager tenure.
16:561:40962:17:16:81:540:153:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:10In turnover-performance regressions that exclude fund fixed effects, we cluster not only by sector times
16:562:41068:16:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:month but also by fund, to account for potential residual correlation induced by the exclusion of fund fixed
16:563:41176:12:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:effects.  In subsequent regressions withF undT urnas the dependent variable, we cluster by fund, since
16:564:41278:12:8:72:489:113:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f7:F undT urnis highly persistent, and by year, to allow cross-sectional dependence inF undT urn.
16:565:41372:8:16:81:540:105:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:11The relations between fund performance and funds’ investment horizons are analyzed by Yan and Zhang
16:566:41473:16:0:72:468:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(2009), Cremers and Pareek (2016), and Lan, Moneta, and Wermers (2015), among others.
17:567:41560:0:18:89:539:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We run a linear turnover-performance regression.  Besides its natural simplicity, the
17:568:41645:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:linear specification is motivated by our model. Recall that if the trading cost function is
17:569:41736:18:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:approximately linear (γ≈0), so is the turnover-performance relation (see equation (11)).
17:570:41824:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In principle, the relation could also be convex (ifγ  >0), but we find no such evidence.
17:571:41912:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We estimate a nonparametric regression ofRi,tonXi,t−1, both demeaned at the fund level.
17:572:41999:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find that the fitted values from that regression are remarkably close to linear, providing
17:573:42092:18:28:72:360:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:support for our regression specification in equation (20).
17:574:42150:28:18:89:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The positive turnover-performance relation emerges not only from the panel regression
17:575:42235:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in Table 1, which imposes the restriction (19), but also from fund-by-fund regressions. For
17:576:42326:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:each fundi, we estimate the slopebifrom the time-series regression in equation (17) in the
17:577:42416:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:full sample. We find that 61% of the OLS slope estimateŝbiare positive. Moreover, 9% (4%)
17:578:42506:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of thêbi’s are significantly positive at the 5% (1%) confidence level. A weighted average of
17:579:42599:18:18:72:539:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thesêbi’s appears in the top left cell of Table 1, as shown in equation (37).12Apart from
17:580:42689:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this brief summary, we do not analyze thêbiestimates because their precision is generally
17:581:42779:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:low given the funds’ relatively short track records. Instead, we focus on the panel-regression
17:582:42873:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimate ofbwhose precision is higher thanks to information-pooling across funds. The panel-
17:583:42965:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:regression slope characterizes the typical fund-month observation, rather than the typical
17:584:43055:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund. Therefore, we do not find that the typical fund exhibits a positive turnover-performance
17:585:43149:18:18:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation. Rather, we find that the typical fund-month exhibits a positive relation, which
17:586:43238:18:28:72:445:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:implies that there must exist some funds that exhibit a positive relation.
17:587:43312:28:18:89:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Mutual funds sometimes benefit from receiving allocations of shares in initial public
17:588:43397:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:offerings (IPOs) at below-market prices. Lead underwriters tend to allocate more IPO shares
17:589:43488:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to fund families from which they receive larger brokerage commissions (e.g., Reuter, 2006).
17:590:43579:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To the extent that higher commissions are associated with higher turnover, this practice
17:591:43667:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:could potentially contribute to a positive turnover-performance relation. This contribution
17:592:43758:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is unlikely to be substantial, though. Fund families tend to distribute IPO shares across
17:593:43847:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds based on criteria such as past returns and fees rather than turnover (Gaspar, Massa,
17:594:43937:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Matos, 2006). In addition, the high commissions that help families earn IPO allocations
17:595:44028:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:often reflect an elevated commission rate rather than high family turnover, and they are often
17:596:44122:18:18:72:539:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:paid around the time of the IPO rather than over the previous fiscal year.13Moreover, the
17:597:44211:18:18:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contribution of IPO allocations to fund performance seems modest. For each year between
17:598:44298:18:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:1980 and 2013, we calculate the ratio of total money left on the table across all IPOs, obtained
17:599:44394:18:19:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from Jay Ritter’s website, to total assets of active domestic equity mutual funds, obtained
17:600:44485:19:15:81:540:108:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:12The cross-sectional correlation between̂biand the length of fundi’s track record is insignificant at 0.02,
17:601:44593:15:9:72:449:93:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:indicating that the turnover-performance relation is no stronger for longer-lived funds.
17:602:44681:9:0:81:528:84:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:13See, for example, Nimalendran, Ritter, and Zhang (2007) and Goldstein, Irvine, and Puckett (2011).
18:603:44783:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from the Investment Company Institute.  This ratio, whose mean is 0.30%, exceeds the
18:604:44867:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contribution of IPO allocations to fund performance because mutual funds receive only about
18:605:44958:18:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:25% to 41% of IPO allocations, on average.14IPOs thus boost average fund performance
18:606:45042:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by only about 7.5 to 12 basis points per year. Furthermore, the IPO market has cooled
18:607:45127:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significantly since year 2000. Money left on the table has decreased to only 0.10% of fund
18:608:45217:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assets on average, so that IPOs have boosted average fund performance by only 2.5 to 4
18:609:45303:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:basis points per year since January 2001. Yet the turnover-performance relation remains
18:610:45390:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:strong during this cold-IPO-market subperiod: the slope estimates in the top row of Table
18:611:45479:18:28:72:409:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:1 remain positive and significant, witht-statistics in excess of 3.2.
18:612:45548:28:18:89:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:If we were to redefine our dependent variable from fund returns to dollar value added
18:613:45633:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(Berk and van Binsbergen, 2015), the results would be very similar, by the following logic.
18:614:45724:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When the dependent variable is dollar value added, the independent variable should be
18:615:45809:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover in dollars. Making these changes amounts to multiplying both sides of our cur-
18:616:45896:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rent regression by fund size. The new regression suffers from a heteroskedasticity problem,
18:617:45987:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:because larger funds have more-volatile (dollar) residuals. Adjusting for this heteroskedas-
18:618:46079:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ticity requires down-weighting larger funds, for example, by dividing both sides of the new
18:619:46170:18:29:72:489:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:regression by fund size. After this division, we are back to our current regression.
18:620:46254:29:18:89:539:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We report all of our results based on the full sample period of 1979–2011. In addition, we
18:621:46344:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:verify the robustness of our results in the 2000–2011 subperiod, motivated by two potential
18:622:46435:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:structural changes in the data. The first change relates to the way CRSP reports turnover.
18:623:46525:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Prior to September 1998, all funds’ fiscal years are reported as January–December, raising
18:624:46615:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the possibility of inaccuracy, since after 1998 the timing of funds’ fiscal years varies across
18:625:46710:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds.15The second change, identified by P ́astor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015), relates to
18:626:46801:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the reporting of fund size and expense ratios before 1993. Using the 2000–2011 subperiod
18:627:46889:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:provides a robustness check that is conservative in avoiding both potential structural changes.
18:628:46984:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find that all of our main conclusions are robust to using the 2000–2011 subperiod.
18:629:47069:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For example, the time-series turnover-performance relation in Table 1 remains positive and
18:630:47159:18:18:72:539:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significant, witht-statistics of 4.37 and 3.74 in the top row.  In the online appendix, we
18:631:47249:18:18:72:490:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:report the counterparts of all of our tables estimated in the 2000–2011 subperiod.
18:632:47331:18:12:81:508:181:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:14These estimates are from Reuter (2006), Ritter and Zhang (2007), and Field and Lowry (2009).
18:633:47425:12:15:81:540:169:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:15In private communication, CRSP explained that this change in reporting is related to the change in its
18:634:47529:15:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:fund data provider from S&P to Lipper on August 31, 1998. CRSP has also explained the timing convention
18:635:47632:12:12:72:539:142:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:for turnover, which is the variableturnratioin CRSP’sfundfeesfile. If the variablefiscalyearendis present
18:636:47737:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:in the file, turnover is measured over the 12-month period ending on thefiscalyearenddate; otherwise
18:637:47837:12:0:72:493:118:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:turnover is measured over the 12-month period ending on the date marked by the variablebegdt.
19:638:47932:0:37:72:232:723:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.2.1.  Measuring Turnover
19:639:47958:37:18:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We measure fund turnover by its official SEC definition from equation (18). One advantage
19:640:48047:18:17:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of this measure is that, by taking the minimum of purchases and sales, it largely excludes
19:641:48137:17:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover arising from persistent inflows and outflows to and from the fund. For example,
19:642:48225:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if a fund experiences inflows throughout the year, it will probably use those inflows to buy
19:643:48317:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stocks, but the SEC turnover will pick up the fund’s sales, which are not driven by flows.
19:644:48407:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Similarly, if a fund experiences persistent outflows, there will be flow-driven selling, but our
19:645:48503:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover measure will pick up the fund’s purchases. Since fund flows are well known to be
19:646:48592:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:persistent, our turnover measure is largely immune to flows. Instead, it reflects mostly the
19:647:48684:18:29:72:428:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund’s active portfolio decisions to replace some holdings with others.
19:648:48755:29:18:89:539:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our turnover measure is not completely immune to fund flows, though. If flows are non-
19:649:48841:18:18:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:persistent then some of our turnover is flow-driven. Flow-driven trading is fairly mechanical
19:650:48934:18:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in that its timing is determined mostly by the fund’s investors rather than the fund’s man-
19:651:49025:18:17:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ager. Therefore, flow-driven turnover should exhibit a weaker relation to fund performance
19:652:49115:17:18:72:539:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:than our turnover measure,F undT urn.  To test this hypothesis, we construct two mea-
19:653:49200:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sures of flow-driven fund turnover. Both measures rely on monthly dollar flows, which we
19:654:49288:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:back out from the monthly series of fund size and fund returns, and both cover the same
19:655:49375:18:18:72:539:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:12-month period asF undT urn. The first measure is the sum of the absolute values of the
19:656:49463:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:12 monthly dollar flows, divided by the average fund size during the 12-month period. The
19:657:49552:18:18:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:second measure is the smaller of two sums, one of all positive dollar flows and one of all neg-
19:658:49647:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ative flows during the 12-month period, divided by average fund size. Consistent with our
19:659:49736:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:hypothesis, we find that neither measure of flow-driven turnover has any predictive power for
19:660:49829:18:18:72:539:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund returns, whether or not we includeF undT urnas a control. Moreover, the inclusion of
19:661:49918:18:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:flow-driven turnover does not affect the significant predictive power ofF undT urn. Finally,
19:662:50010:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when we adjust our turnover measure for flows by subtracting flow-driven turnover from
19:663:50096:18:18:72:539:245:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:F undT urn, we find that the difference strongly predicts fund performance. All these results
19:664:50189:18:29:72:524:227:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:provide additional support for our interpretation of the turnover-performance relation.16
19:665:50278:29:17:89:540:198:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In our final test related to fund flows, we calculate their time-series volatility, which could
19:666:50373:17:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in principle be related to the time variation in fund turnover. We compute flow volatility
19:667:50463:18:18:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for each fund as the standard deviation of the fund’s 12 monthly net flows during the same
19:668:50553:18:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:period over whichF undT urnis measured. When we add flow volatility as a control in our
19:669:50640:18:18:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover-performance regression, the control does not enter significantly and the slope on
19:670:50730:18:18:72:353:109:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:F undT urnremains very similar and highly significant.
19:671:50784:18:15:81:540:91:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:16Our results are also broadly consistent with those of Alexander, Cici, and Gibson (2007) who find that
19:672:50888:15:0:72:461:76:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:future returns of funds’ discretionary trades are higher than those of flow-induced trades.
20:673:50981:0:18:89:539:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In addition to fund flows, some portion of turnover could be driven by other non-
20:674:51062:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:discretionary forces such as manager transitions, benchmark index reconstitutions, portfolio
20:675:51154:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rebalancing, etc. Turnover driven by manager transitions cannot explain our results because
20:676:51245:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:those hold up when we replace fund fixed effects by manager fixed effects, as noted earlier.
20:677:51337:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Benchmark index reconstitutions cannot explain our results either because those survive the
20:678:51428:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inclusion of benchmark-month fixed effects, as explained earlier. Another way to account
20:679:51516:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for benchmark index turnover is to estimate it from the turnover of index funds tracking
20:680:51604:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the fund’s benchmark. For each active fund, we calculate benchmark-adjusted turnover as
20:681:51691:18:18:72:539:579:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:F undT urnminus the median turnover of all index funds in the same Morningstar cate-
20:682:51775:18:17:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gory, measured over the same period asF undT urn. When we replaceF undT urnby its
20:683:51856:17:18:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:benchmark-adjusted version, we continue to find a positive and highly significant turnover-
20:684:51947:18:29:72:181:526:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance relation.
20:685:51968:29:18:89:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Regardless of its source, any trading unrelated to profit motive widens the gap between
20:686:52055:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a fund’s turnover and its optimal turnover in the context of our model.  Therefore, any
20:687:52142:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:such trading should make it more difficult for us to find a positive turnover-performance
20:688:52231:18:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation.  Yet we do find a strong relation, even without adjusting reported turnover for
20:689:52320:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:non-discretionary trading. It is possible that some adjustment could enhance the predictive
20:690:52411:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:power of SEC turnover, but it is not our goal to find the best predictor of fund returns. For
20:691:52504:18:29:72:459:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:simplicity, we use the SEC turnover measure throughout our main analysis.
20:692:52577:29:17:89:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For robustness, we consider one more modification of our turnover measure. The denom-
20:693:52662:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:inator of our measure is average fund size over the previous fiscal year. To see whether this
20:694:52755:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:averaging somehow influences our results, we rescale our turnover measure by the ratio of
20:695:52844:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the same average fund size to fund size at the beginning of the previous fiscal year. The
20:696:52933:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:denominator of the turnover measure thus changes from average size to fund size at the
20:697:53019:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:beginning of the previous fiscal year. We find that this rescaled turnover measure predicts
20:698:53110:18:29:72:409:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance even more strongly than our standard SEC measure.
20:699:53171:29:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Even though we analyze equity mutual funds, some of the funds’ turnover could be due
20:700:53255:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to non-equity assets.  To see whether non-equity turnover matters, we obtain data from
20:701:53341:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Morningstar on the percentage of each fund’s assets invested in stock. When we add this
20:702:53428:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:percentage as a control in our turnover-performance regression, it enters with a small positive
20:703:53523:18:0:72:460:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficient, but the explanatory power ofF undT urnis virtually unchanged.
21:704:53599:0:37:72:298:723:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.2.2.  Alternative Benchmark Models
21:705:53635:37:18:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We benchmark each fund’s performance against the index selected for the fund’s category
21:706:53722:18:17:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by Morningstar. For example, for small-cap value funds, the benchmark is the Russell 2000
21:707:53811:17:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Value Index; for large-cap growth funds, it is Russell 1000 Growth.  Morningstar assigns
21:708:53899:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds to categories by relying heavily on the funds’ reported portfolio holdings. Since these
21:709:53992:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assignments are made by Morningstar rather than by funds themselves, there is no room
21:710:54077:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for benchmark manipulation of the kind documented by Sensoy (2009).  The benchmark
21:711:54159:18:29:72:479:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assigned by Morningstar can differ from that reported in the fund’s prospectus.
21:712:54238:29:18:89:539:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our index-based approach is likely to adjust for fund style and risk more precisely than
21:713:54326:18:18:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the commonly used loadings on the three Fama-French factors. The Fama-French factors
21:714:54410:18:18:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are popular in mutual fund studies because their returns are freely available, unlike the
21:715:54499:18:18:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Morningstar benchmark index data. Yet the Fama-French factors are not obvious benchmark
21:716:54586:18:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:choices because they are long-short portfolios whose returns cannot be costlessly achieved by
21:717:54679:18:17:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mutual fund managers. Moreover, Cremers, Petajisto, and Zitzewitz (2013) argue that the
21:718:54766:17:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Fama-French model produces biased assessments of fund performance, and they recommend
21:719:54851:18:18:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:using index-based benchmarks instead. We follow this advice. But we find similar results
21:720:54939:18:18:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:when we adjust fund returns by using the three Fama-French factors: the slope coefficients in
21:721:55032:18:18:72:539:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the top row of Table 1 continue to be highly significant, witht-statistics of 7.09 and 8.27, while
21:722:55130:18:18:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the slopes in the bottom row remain insignificant. We also find similar results when using
21:723:55220:18:18:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:three additional alternative benchmark models: the four-factor model that includes the three
21:724:55312:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Fama-French factors and momentum, the five-factor model of Fama and French (2014), and
21:725:55398:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the modified Fama-French three-factor model of Cremers, Petajisto, and Zitzewitz (2013).
21:726:55486:18:18:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In all three cases, our main slope coefficients in the top row of Table 1 continue to be highly
21:727:55581:18:18:72:539:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significant, witht-statistics ranging from 5.93 to 9.34. The slope coefficients in the bottom
21:728:55674:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:row remain insignificant, except when we use the Fama-French five factors or Cremers-
21:729:55759:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Petajisto-Zitzewitz factors, for which thet-statistics range from 2.05 to 3.71. That is, under
21:730:55853:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:those two benchmark models, the positive turnover-performance relation emerges also from
21:731:55941:18:28:72:465:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the cross-section, but in general, the relation appears only in the time series.
21:732:56021:28:18:89:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We assess fund performance by subtracting Morningstar’s designated benchmark return
21:733:56104:18:18:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from the fund’s return, effectively assuming that the fund’s benchmark beta is equal to
21:734:56191:18:18:72:540:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:one. This simple approach is popular in investment practice, and it circumvents the need to
21:735:56282:18:18:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimate the funds’ betas. When we estimate those betas using OLS, we find very similar
21:736:56369:18:18:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results. To avoid using imprecise beta estimates for short-lived funds, we replace OLS betas
21:737:56461:18:18:72:540:91:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of funds having track records shorter than 24 months by the average beta of funds in the same
21:738:56554:18:0:72:540:73:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Morningstar category. Just as in Table 1, we find that the slope estimates in the bottom
22:739:56644:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:row are insignificant while the slopes in the top row are highly significant, witht-statistics
22:740:56738:18:29:72:137:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of about 7.6.
22:741:56751:29:18:89:539:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The tests described above assume that funds’ betas are time-invariant. In separate tests,
22:742:56840:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we allow funds’ betas on benchmarks or factors to vary over time in order to assess the
22:743:56927:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:extent to which turnover-related performance might reflect variation in systematic risk. If
22:744:57018:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:high turnover were associated with more systematic risk, then the higher returns following
22:745:57108:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:high turnover could represent risk compensation or simply factor timing—identifying factor-
22:746:57199:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:related mispricing. While it is not clear a priori why higher turnover should be followed
22:747:57288:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by more as opposed to less systematic risk, we nevertheless allow time variation in funds’
22:748:57378:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:betas on their Morningstar benchmarks and the factors in the four alternative factor models
22:749:57469:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:described above. In those results, the turnover-performance relation weakens only modestly,
22:750:57560:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:suggesting that relation might include some risk compensation or factor timing. In all cases,
22:751:57653:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:however, thet-statistic for the slope on turnover exceeds five. In general, turnover can reflect
22:752:57749:18:50:72:528:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:various sources of profitable trading—stock picking, industry rotation, factor timing, etc.
22:753:57840:50:41:72:315:429:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:4.  Differences Across Funds
22:754:57868:41:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our evidence so far reveals that the typical fund performs better after it trades more. Next,
22:755:57961:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we ask whether this time-series relation differs across funds.  We distinguish funds along
22:756:58051:18:18:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:four characteristics: fund size, expense ratio (or “fee,” for short), and two common style
22:757:58141:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:classifications—small-cap versus large-cap and value versus growth. For each of these four
22:758:58231:18:18:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:characteristics, we assign a fund to one of three categories. For fund size and fee, in each
22:759:58323:18:17:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:monthtwe compute the terciles ofF undSizei,t−1andExpenseRatioi,t−1, the most recent
22:760:58406:17:18:72:539:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:values of fundi’s assets under management and fees available from CRSP prior to montht.
22:761:58493:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For the two style classifications, we use the 3×3 “style-box” assignments of Morningstar,
22:762:58582:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which uses a fund’s holdings to classify the fund as (i) small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap and
22:763:58675:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(ii) value, blend, or growth. In our sample, these two style classifications are held constant
22:764:58769:18:29:72:179:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:over a fund’s history.
22:765:58791:29:18:89:540:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Panels A through D of Table 2 report the estimated slope coefficients on turnover for each
22:766:58881:18:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the four characteristics used to classify funds. Each panel reports two sets of regressions.
22:767:58976:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In the first set (indicated by “Controls” as “No”), the simple regression in equation (20)
22:768:59066:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is run without additional control variables. The second set of regressions (with “Controls”
22:769:59157:18:18:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as “Yes”) controls for the other three fund characteristics by including category dummies
22:770:59246:18:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interacted with lagged turnover. For the latter regressions, the slopes reported in each panel
22:771:59340:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:should be interpreted as applying to a fund falling in the given category of that panel’s
23:772:59431:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:characteristic and having middle-category values of the characteristics in the other three
23:773:59521:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:panels. For example, the slopes in Panel A correspond to a blend fund with medium size
23:774:59607:18:29:72:211:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and medium expense ratio.
23:775:59632:29:18:89:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 2 reveals a significantly positive turnover-performance relation in eight of the nine
23:776:59723:18:18:72:539:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:no-controls regressions. The only exception is large funds, having at-statistic of 1.46 (Panel
23:777:59817:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C, third column). In other words, a positive turnover-performance relation is quite pervasive
23:778:59910:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across the various subsets of funds produced by the four classifications.  The relation is
23:779:60000:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significant for small-cap funds, small funds, and high-fee funds even when we include controls,
23:780:60095:18:29:72:530:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thereby characterizing funds whose other three characteristics are in the middle category.
23:781:60185:29:18:89:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We also see in Table 2 that turnover-performance slopes are significantly larger for small-
23:782:60276:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cap funds as compared to large-cap funds (Panel A), small funds as compared to large funds
23:783:60366:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(Panel C), and high-fee funds as compared to low-fee funds (Panel D). These significant
23:784:60453:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:differences occur in both the no-controls and with-controls results, and they are rather dra-
23:785:60546:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:matic. For example, in the with-control results, small-cap funds have a slope of 0.00205
23:786:60634:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(t= 3.53), nearly seven times the large-cap slope of 0.00030 (t= 0.81). The differences
23:787:60721:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:associated with fund size and fees are similarly large. In contrast, growth and value funds
23:788:60812:18:28:72:428:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:do not exhibit a significant difference in turnover-performance slopes.
23:789:60883:28:18:89:539:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our model helps explain the differences across funds’ turnover-performance slopes. Con-
23:790:60970:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sider Panel A of Table 2, which shows a larger slope for small-cap funds than for large-cap
23:791:61061:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds. From equation (13), the turnover-performance slope is increasing in the trading cost
23:792:61152:18:18:72:539:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:per unit of turnover,c, and decreasing in the autocorrelation of turnover,ρ. If a fund has
23:793:61242:18:18:72:539:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher trading costs (higherc), then it optimally adjusts its turnover less when profit op-
23:794:61333:18:18:72:539:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:portunitiesπtchange (equation (5)). Therefore, any observed change in turnover must be
23:795:61419:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:associated with a larger change in profit opportunities and hence performance. Small-cap
23:796:61507:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stocks are generally understood to be less liquid than large-cap stocks, socis likely to be
23:797:61598:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:greater for small-cap funds. If a fund’s turnover is less persistent (lowerρ), then the profits
23:798:61693:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from last period’s high turnover are less likely to be offset by trading costs from high turnover
23:799:61790:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this period. Table 3 shows that the turnover of small-cap funds has significantly lower au-
23:800:61881:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tocorrelation than that of large-cap funds. According to our model, having both a higher
23:801:61969:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:cand a lowerρmakes small-cap funds more likely to have a higher turnover-performance
23:802:62053:18:28:72:516:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:slope. We see from Table 2 that small-cap funds indeed have a higher estimated slope.
23:803:62138:28:18:89:540:124:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A similar interpretation applies to the results in Panel C of Table 2, which reports a
23:804:62224:18:18:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significantly larger turnover-performance slope for small funds than for large funds. Small
23:805:62315:18:0:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds, by virtue of their trading smaller dollar amounts, are better suited for trading less-
24:806:62410:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:liquid stocks than are large funds. As stock size is surely an imperfect liquidity measure,
24:807:62501:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:it seems reasonable that fund size also helps proxy for the liquidity of the fund’s holdings.
24:808:62594:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:That is, thecfor small funds is likely to be greater than for large funds, even controlling for
24:809:62689:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stock size. In addition, we see from Table 3 that small-fund turnover has a significantly lower
24:810:62784:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:autocorrelation than does large-fund turnover. Therefore, as with small-cap funds, having a
24:811:62875:18:18:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:highercand a lowerρmakes small funds more likely to have a higher turnover-performance
24:812:62961:18:28:72:281:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:slope, also consistent with our estimates.
24:813:63003:28:18:89:549:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Recall from Panel B of Table 2 that there is no significant difference in turnover-performance
24:814:63097:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:slopes for value versus growth funds.  Even this result is somewhat in keeping with our
24:815:63184:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model, in that Edelen, Evans, and Kadlec (2013) report fairly similar trading costs (per unit
24:816:63277:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of turnover) for value and growth funds, consistent withcbeing similar for both categories.
24:817:63368:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, we do see in Table 3 that turnover for growth funds has a significantly
24:818:63458:18:29:72:365:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher autocorrelation than does turnover of value funds.
24:819:63515:29:18:89:539:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The differences in turnover-performance slopes related to expense ratio, reported in Panel
24:820:63605:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:D of Table 2, must be interpreted outside our model, in which expense ratio does not appear.
24:821:63697:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Expense ratio, closely related to the management fee rate, may proxy for skill. One would
24:822:63786:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:expect managers with more skill to receive more fee revenue (e.g., Berk and Green (2004)),
24:823:63876:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and fee revenue is proportional to the fee rate, conditional on a given fund size. The fee
24:824:63966:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rate is not necessarily positively correlated with skill unconditionally, as that correlation
24:825:64059:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:depends on how size covaries with fees and skill in the cross-section, but it seems reasonable
24:826:64153:17:18:72:539:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for managers with greater skill to charge higher fee rates.17Also, we find a higher slope
24:827:64242:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for high-fee funds regardless of whether we condition on fund size by including controls
24:828:64330:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in Panel D. Less-skilled (and thus lower-fee) funds are likely to have a lower turnover-
24:829:64418:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance slope, because they tend to make two mistakes. First, they sometimes trade
24:830:64504:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:too much, perceiving profit opportunities that do not really exist. Consistent with this idea,
24:831:64598:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Christoffersen and Sarkissian (2011) argue that overconfidence sometimes leads mutual funds
24:832:64689:18:18:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to trade too much.18Second, less-skilled funds sometimes trade too little, failing to perceive
24:833:64783:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:profit opportunities that truly exist. Because of these mistakes, some of the time variation
24:834:64875:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in a less-skilled fund’s turnover is unrelated to time variation in true profit opportunities,
24:835:64969:18:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:producing a weaker turnover-performance relation. If a fund is so unskilled that its turnover
24:836:65062:18:15:81:540:163:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:17Consistent with this idea, Kacperczyk, van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp (2014) report that funds with
24:837:65163:15:9:72:373:148:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:superior stock-picking skill charge significantly higher expense ratios.
24:838:65235:9:15:81:540:139:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:18Christoffersen and Sarkissian (2011) find that excessive trading is more prevalent among fund managers
24:839:65339:15:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:working in major financial centers. They also find that excess turnover declines with experience, consistent
24:840:65447:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:with overconfident managers gradually learning their true ability. While the authors’ focus is on demographic
24:841:65556:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:determinants of turnover, they also report a mixed relation between turnover and performance based on panel
24:842:65663:12:0:72:320:88:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:regressions similar to ours but without fund fixed effects.
25:843:65724:0:29:72:343:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is pure noise, the turnover-performance slope is zero.
25:844:65778:29:18:89:540:694:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Besides fees, we consider two additional proxies for fund skill. First, we take a fund’s
25:845:65866:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gross alpha over the fund’s lifetime. Second, we compute gross alpha adjusted for both fund-
25:846:65958:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:level and industry-level returns to scale, following P ́astor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015).
25:847:66050:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:For both proxies, we find that high-skill funds exhibit a significantly stronger turnover-
25:848:66140:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance relation than low-skill funds. These results, which are consistent with those in
25:849:66232:17:29:72:326:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table 2 based on fees, are in the online appendix.
25:850:66282:29:18:89:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The appendix also shows the results from an exercise that takes a different perspective
25:851:66369:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on skill. Del Guercio and Reuter (2014) argue that broker-sold mutual funds face a weaker
25:852:66458:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:incentive to generate alpha than funds sold directly to retail investors. Motivated by their
25:853:66550:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:evidence, we compare the strength of the turnover-performance relation across these market
25:854:66640:18:18:72:539:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:segments.19We find that the relation is somewhat stronger in direct-sold funds than in
25:855:66726:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:broker-sold funds. The turnover-performance slope is 40% larger in magnitude for direct-
25:856:66814:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sold funds, but the slope difference is not statistically significant (thep-value is 15%). While
25:857:66910:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this evidence is inconclusive, it points in the direction of direct-sold funds having a stronger
25:858:67006:18:29:72:426:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:incentive to perform, consistent with Del Guercio and Reuter (2014).
25:859:67074:29:17:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, the average gross fund returns reported in Table 3 are also consistent with the
25:860:67162:17:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model, in two ways.  In each of the four panels of Table 3, the average gross return of
25:861:67249:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the top category is significantly greater than the bottom category.  The same is true for
25:862:67338:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:two other quantities that our model predicts to be related to expected gross return: average
25:863:67430:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover (Table 3) and the turnover-performance slope (Table 2). The observed link between
25:864:67520:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the average gross return and average turnover is consistent with the model’s prediction of
25:865:67610:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:a positive cross-sectional turnover-performance relation (cf. equations (14) and (15)), and
25:866:67701:18:18:72:539:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:also with the positive cross-sectional slope estimate in Table 1.20The observed link to the
25:867:67792:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover-performance slope is consistent with equations (13) through (15).  According to
25:868:67880:18:18:72:539:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f8:equation (13), the slope should be larger for funds with higher values ofcandθ, holdingρ
25:869:67968:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:constant. According to equations (14) and (15), funds with highercandθshould also have
25:870:68054:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher expected gross returns, holding average turnover constant. Interestingly, the only top-
25:871:68148:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:minus-bottom difference for which the slope in Table 2 is insignificant, growth minus value,
25:872:68240:18:17:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is also the only difference for which the average gross return in Table 3 is only marginally
25:873:68332:17:16:81:540:153:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:19To classify fund share classes by distribution channel, we use the approximation method of Sun (2014).
25:874:68436:16:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:We treat a share class as broker-sold if it has a non-zero front load, non-zero back load, or 12b-1 fee exceeding
25:875:68549:12:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:25 bps; otherwise, we treat it as direct-sold. Following Del Guercio and Reuter (2014), we classify a fund as
25:876:68658:12:8:72:518:113:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:broker-sold (direct-sold) if at least 75% of its assets are broker-sold (direct-sold) on average over time.
25:877:68765:8:16:81:540:105:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:20This evidence is also consistent with the result of Kacperczyk, van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp (2014)
25:878:68868:16:0:72:447:89:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:that funds with superior stock-picking skill have significantly higher average turnover.
26:879:68958:0:51:72:297:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:significant, which jibes well with the model.
26:880:69003:51:40:72:478:672:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:5.  The Common Component of Fund Turnover
26:881:69044:40:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Given our focus on the time variation in fund turnover, it seems natural to examine the
26:882:69131:18:18:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:extent to which this variation is common across funds. In this section, we aggregate turnover
26:883:69224:18:18:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across funds and explore its time variation. In Section 5.1, we analyze comovement in fund
26:884:69314:18:18:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover.  In Section 5.2, we investigate the determinants of the common component of
26:885:69399:18:18:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover. Finally, in Section 5.3, we study the predictive power of the common component
26:886:69487:18:45:72:183:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for fund performance.
26:887:69508:45:37:72:292:497:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:5.1.  Commonality in Turnover
26:888:69537:37:18:72:539:460:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In our model, time variation in fund turnover is driven by variation in the fund’s profit
26:889:69626:18:18:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opportunities. Those opportunities are likely to be positively correlated across funds. Any
26:890:69717:18:18:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mispriced stock presents a profit opportunity to many different funds that can potentially
26:891:69807:18:18:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trade this stock. Moreover, if mispricing has market-wide causes such as liquidity disruptions
26:892:69901:18:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or investor sentiment, many stocks can be mispriced at the same time. If profit opportunities
26:893:69994:18:28:72:506:370:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are indeed correlated across funds, the model predicts comovement in fund turnover.
26:894:70077:28:18:89:539:342:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To see whether such comovement exists, we first compute category-level averages of
26:895:70159:18:18:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:individual fund turnover. We consider the same fund categories as before: three stock-size
26:896:70249:18:18:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:categories, three value-growth categories, three fund-size categories, and three expense-ratio
26:897:70343:18:18:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:categories.  For each category, we compute the average turnover across all funds in that
26:898:70431:18:18:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:category. Specifically, average turnover in monthtis the equal-weighted average turnover

26:900:70592:29:18:89:539:223:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Figure 1 plots the time series of the category-level average turnover over the 1979-2011
26:901:70680:18:18:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:period.  The figure shows strong comovement in turnover.  The times series of average
26:902:70765:18:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover are highly correlated both within and across the four panels.  For example, the
26:903:70853:18:18:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlation between the average turnovers of small-cap and large-cap funds, both of which
26:904:70942:18:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are plotted in Panel A, is 59%. We observe similar correlations, ranging from 52% to 61%,
26:905:71031:18:17:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between the average turnovers of value and growth funds (Panel B), small and large funds
26:906:71119:17:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(Panel C), and high-fee and low-fee funds (Panel D). All pairwise correlations within each
26:907:71209:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:panel are reported in Table 4. In the context of our model, this evidence of comovement
26:908:71296:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in turnover indicates that profit opportunities are positively correlated across funds—even
27:909:71389:0:29:72:287:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across funds with different characteristics.
27:910:71433:29:18:89:540:694:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Panel B of Figure 1 provides more evidence on the result from Table 3 that growth funds
27:911:71520:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turn over more than value funds. Interestingly, the turnover of growth funds exceeds that of
27:912:71612:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:value funds not only on average but also in every single year, and by a wide margin. Value
27:913:71702:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds appear to be more patient than growth funds in exploiting their profit opportunities.
27:914:71793:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We also see in Panel D that more expensive funds tend to turn over more than cheaper
27:915:71877:17:29:72:424:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:funds. The patterns in Panels A and C are less consistent over time.
27:916:71945:29:18:89:539:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In addition to computing average turnover at the category level, we compute it at the
27:917:72030:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:aggregate level. We letAvgT urndenote the average of individual fund turnover computed
27:918:72116:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across all funds. Analogous to the category-level variable,AvgT urntis the average turnover
27:919:72207:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across funds’ 12-month fiscal periods that contain montht.AvgT urnt, plotted in Panel A
27:920:72294:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of Figure 2, fluctuates between 59% and 102% per year from 1979 to 2011.21It has a 95%
27:921:72380:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlation with the first principal component of individual fund turnover. Therefore, we
27:922:72469:18:29:72:481:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:viewAvgT urntas the simplest measure of the common component of turnover.
27:923:72542:29:18:89:540:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To shed more light on commonality in turnover, we regress individual fund turnover in
27:924:72627:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:monthton its common component,AvgT urnt.22To isolate time-series variation in turnover,
27:925:72714:18:17:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:we run a panel regression with fund fixed effects. We report the results in the first column
27:926:72806:17:18:72:539:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of Table 5.  The slope coefficient from the regression ofF undT urnonAvgT urnis 0.65
27:927:72890:18:29:72:409:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(t= 8.65), indicating strong evidence of commonality in turnover.
27:928:72955:29:18:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The evidence of commonality strengthens further when we add category-level average
27:929:73037:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover to the right-hand side of the above regression.  For each fundi, we calculate
27:930:73123:18:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:AvgT urnStockSizeas the average turnover across funds in the same stock-size category
27:931:73208:18:18:72:539:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:as fundi. In the regression ofF undT urnon bothAvgT urnandAvgT urnStockSize, the
27:932:73288:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:category-level average is highly significant (t= 5.27), the sum of the slopes on the two aver-
27:933:73382:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ages is again 0.65, and theR2increases by almost half. We also calculate average turnover
27:934:73471:18:18:72:539:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across funds in the same value-growth category (AvgT urnStockV G), same fund-size cate-
27:935:73558:18:17:72:542:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gory (AvgT urnF undSize), and same expense-ratio category (AvgT urnF undExp). While
27:936:73641:17:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the value-growth average is insignificant when added to the above regression, the other
27:937:73728:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:two averages produce results very similar to those obtained for the stock-size average: the
27:938:73819:18:16:81:540:160:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:21CRSP turnover data are missing in 1991 for unknown reasons. We therefore treatAvgT urnas missing
27:939:73917:16:12:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:in 1991 in our regressions. In Figure 2, though, we fill in average turnover in 1991 by using Morningstar data,
27:940:74028:12:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:for aesthetic purposes. We rely on CRSP turnover data in our analysis because Morningstar is ambiguous
27:941:74130:12:8:72:240:120:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:about the timing of funds’ fiscal years.
27:942:74170:8:16:81:539:112:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:22For the purpose of this regression, we recalculateAvgT urntcorresponding to each fundias the average
27:943:74272:16:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:turnover across all fundsj6=i. By excluding fundifrom the calculation of average turnover, we exclude
27:944:74373:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:any mechanical correlation that could create a spurious perception of commonality. Analogously, we exclude
27:945:74479:12:0:72:456:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:fundifrom all other measures of average turnover discussed in the following paragraph.
28:946:74567:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:category-level average is highly significant, the sum of the slopes on the two averages is a bit
28:947:74663:18:18:72:539:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:larger than 0.65, and theR2increases by almost half. Finally, we calculate average turnover
28:948:74754:18:18:72:539:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:across “similar” funds,AvgT urnSim, by averaging across funds in the same stock-size,
28:949:74839:18:18:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund-size, and expense-ratio categories. (We exclude value-growth due to its insignificance
28:950:74930:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:observed earlier.) When added to the above regression, this variable comes in highly sig-
28:951:75019:18:18:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:nificant (t= 7.35), the sum of the slopes onAvgT urnandAvgT urnSimis 0.68, and the
28:952:75101:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:R2almost doubles. This evidence, which is reported in Table 5, shows that commonality in
28:953:75189:18:45:72:430:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover is especially strong among funds with similar characteristics.
28:954:75260:45:36:72:275:552:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:5.2.  Mispricing and Trading
28:955:75288:36:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:When do funds trade more than usual? In our model, funds trade more when their profit
28:956:75373:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opportunities are better. If such opportunities arise from mispricing, then funds should trade
28:957:75467:18:18:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more in periods with more mispricing. We thus ask whether fund turnover is higher when
28:958:75553:18:18:72:539:462:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mispricing is more likely. We use three proxies for the likelihood of mispricing:Sentimentt,
28:959:75645:18:29:72:460:444:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:V olatilityt, andLiquidityt. We plot the three series in Panel B of Figure 2.
28:960:75722:29:18:89:540:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The first mispricing proxy,Sentimentt, is the value in monthtof Baker and Wurgler’s

28:962:75896:18:18:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ily in the stock market during high-sentiment periods, the mispricing such investors create
28:963:75987:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is more likely to occur during those periods (e.g., Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan, 2012). We
28:964:76073:18:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thus expect funds exploiting such mispricing to trade more when sentiment is high. Con-

28:972:76786:18:29:72:365:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fraction of the time variation in aggregate fund turnover.
28:973:76844:29:18:89:540:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The second mispricing proxy,V olatilityt, is the cross-sectional standard deviation in

28:975:77018:18:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher volatility corresponds to greater uncertainty about future values and thus greater
28:976:77107:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:potential for investors to err in assessing those values. As a result, periods of high volatility
28:977:77204:18:18:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:admit greater potential mispricing, and we expect funds exploiting such mispricing to trade

29:981:77525:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:respectively), as shown in columns 2 and 6 of Table 6. TheR2in the latter regression, which
29:982:77616:18:29:72:489:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:again includes a time trend, exceeds theR2in the trend-only regression by 0.188.
29:983:77696:29:18:89:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The third proxy,Liquidityt, is the value in monthtof the stock-market liquidity measure
29:984:77783:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of P ́astor and Stambaugh (2003). Empirical evidence suggests that higher liquidity is accom-
29:985:77876:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:panied by greater market efficiency (e.g., Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam, 2008, 2011).
29:986:77964:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In other words, periods of lower liquidity are more susceptible to mispricing. Therefore, we
29:987:78056:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:might expect funds to trade more when liquidity is lower. On the other hand, lower liquid-
29:988:78146:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ity also implies higher transaction costs, which could discourage funds from trading. Our

29:1001:79306:18:29:72:386:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:make sense: funds trade more when there is more mispricing.

30:1016:80697:29:18:89:540:694:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, we consider the role of stock market turnover in explainingAvgT urnt.  We
30:1017:80779:18:18:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure market turnover as total dollar volume over the previous 12 months divided by
30:1018:80864:18:18:72:540:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:total market capitalization of ordinary common shares in CRSP. Market turnover reflects
30:1019:80951:18:18:72:539:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trading by all entities, including mutual funds, so it could potentially be related toAvgT urnt.
30:1020:81047:18:17:72:539:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:It could also be related toSentimentt, which is constructed as the first principal component
30:1021:81139:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of six variables that include NYSE turnover. However, when we add market turnover to
30:1022:81223:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the all-inclusive specification in column 8 of Table 6, it does not enter significantly, whereas
30:1023:81319:18:18:72:539:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the slope onSentimenttremains positive and significant. The other two mispricing proxies
30:1024:81407:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:also retain their signs and significance, and the remaining variables remain insignificant. In
30:1025:81501:18:45:72:439:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:short, adding market turnover does not affect our inferences in Table 6.
30:1026:81573:45:37:72:318:488:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:5.3.  Predicting Fund Performance
30:1027:81606:37:18:72:539:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Given its significant link to the mispricing proxies, it is natural to ask whether the common
30:1028:81699:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:component of fund turnover helps predict fund performance.  In fact, a positive relation
30:1029:81787:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between the common component and future performance can be motivated directly within
30:1030:81871:18:18:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our model. In the model, optimal fund turnover,X∗tfrom equation (5), results solely from
30:1031:81959:18:18:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the fund’s decision to change the composition of its portfolio. In the data, however, inflows
30:1032:82052:18:17:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and outflows of investors’ capital also give rise to trading by the fund. The reported turnover
30:1033:82147:17:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure that we observe empirically, ̃Xt, abstracts from flow effects, but only imperfectly,
30:1034:82239:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:so it is not precisely equal toX∗t. There could also be other reasons why a fund’s observed
30:1035:82330:18:25:72:514:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover could differ from its true, optimally chosen value. In other words, we observe
30:1036:82417:25:30:271:540:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4: ̃Xt=X∗t+ut,(23)
30:1037:82433:30:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:whereutdenotes the measurement error.  We assume thatuthas mean zero and is un-
30:1038:82512:18:18:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correlated withX∗t. With many funds in the market, an additional explanatory variable
30:1039:82597:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:useful in addressing this error-in-variable problem is the cross-sectional average turnover,
30:1040:82689:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:which we denote byXt. Intuitively, since turnover comoves across funds, average turnover
30:1041:82777:18:18:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:contains additional information about a fund’s true turnover beyond the information in our
30:1042:82867:18:18:72:539:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:imperfectF undT urnmeasure. We assume that there are sufficiently many funds that the
30:1043:82952:18:27:72:441:145:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measurement errors in turnover diversify away when computingXt. Let
30:1044:83019:27:28:259:540:118:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:X∗t=βXXt+φt,(24)
30:1045:83035:28:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and assume thatφtis uncorrelated withXtand that the residualsφt,ut, and-t+1are mutually
30:1046:83122:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:uncorrelated. Letσ2uandσ2φdenote the variances ofutandφt, respectively. Consider the
31:1047:83208:0:26:72:526:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:linear regression of the fund’s returnRt+1on fund turnover ̃Xtand average turnoverXt:

31:1063:83524:18:17:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:positive, which is consistent with the data (see Tables 1 and 5). Moreover, the coefficient on
31:1064:83618:17:18:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average turnover (θ2) is large when the measurement error in turnover is large (i.e.,σ2ularge)
31:1065:83712:18:18:72:539:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and when the commonality in turnover is large (i.e.,σ2φsmall). Given our strong evidence of
31:1066:83803:18:29:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:commonality, our model suggests a role for average turnover in predicting fund performance.
31:1067:83894:29:18:89:540:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We find such a role in the data.  We run a panel regression of the gross benchmark-
31:1068:83977:18:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:adjusted fund return (GrossRi,t) on average lagged turnover, with fund fixed effects. We de-
31:1069:84069:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:note average lagged turnover, or the average ofF undT urnj,t−1acrossj6=i, byAvgT urnt−1.25
31:1070:84159:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:Column 1 of Table 7 reports the slope from the regression ofGrossRi,tonAvgT urnt−1.26
31:1071:84244:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The slope is positive and significant (t= 2.25), indicating that the common component of
31:1072:84332:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund trading helps predict individual fund performance. The magnitude of the estimate,
31:1073:84418:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:0.00784, implies substantial economic significance. Given the time-series standard deviation
31:1074:84510:18:18:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ofAvgT urnt−1, 0.076, a one-standard-deviation increase in the variable translates to an
31:1075:84598:18:28:72:450:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:increase in expected return of 0.71% per year (= 0.00784×0.076×1200).
31:1076:84667:28:18:89:540:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The information inAvgT urnt−1about a fund’s subsequent performance is undiminished
31:1077:84749:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:by conditioning on the fund’s own turnover. Column 4 of Table 7 shows that the coeffi-
31:1078:84835:18:18:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cient andt-statistic forAvgT urnt−1are little changed by controlling forF undT urni,t−1.
31:1079:84923:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Similarly, the significance of the slope onF undT urni,t−1is little changed by controlling for
31:1080:85017:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:AvgT urnt−1. The fund’s performance is predictable by both average turnover and the fund’s
31:1081:85107:18:17:72:516:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:own turnover. In the context of our model, we findˆθ1>0 andˆθ2>0 in equation (25).
31:1082:85189:17:16:81:540:196:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:25We omit theisubscript fromAvgT urni,t−1because excluding fundifrom the average makes very little
31:1083:85287:16:12:72:540:180:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:difference. Note thatAvgT urnt−1uses only information available before monthtbecause it is the average of
31:1084:85392:12:12:72:539:168:10:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f6:turnovers computed over 12-month periods that end before montht. It is thus reasonable to useAvgT urnt−1
31:1085:85496:12:12:72:539:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:to predict performance in montht. Also note that the notation for time subscripts is complicated by the fact
31:1086:85604:12:12:72:539:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:that funds report turnover only annually. In Section 5.1, we use the notationAvgT urntto denote average
31:1087:85707:12:12:72:539:132:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:turnover across funds’ 12-month fiscal periods that contain montht. That notation is slightly inconsistent
31:1088:85813:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:with the notation in this section because given our definition ofF undT urni,t, the contemporaneous average
31:1089:85920:12:12:72:539:108:10:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f18:turnover in Section 5.1 is the average ofF undT urni,t+11acrossi. We prefer to use the notationAvgT urnt
31:1090:86024:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:(instead ofAvgT urnt+11) in Section 5.1 to emphasize the contemporaneous nature of the analysis in that
31:1091:86127:12:8:72:376:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:section. We hope the reader will pardon this slight abuse of notation.
31:1092:86197:8:0:81:518:76:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:26The regressions in Table 7 exclude a time trend, but the results are very similar if we include one.
32:1093:86301:0:18:89:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The above discussion suggests the predictive power of average turnover is due to common-
32:1094:86389:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ality in turnover. Since this commonality is stronger among funds with similar characteristics
32:1095:86483:18:18:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(recall Table 5), the predictive power of average turnover might improve if the average is
32:1096:86573:18:18:72:539:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:computed across only similar funds. To examine this hypothesis, we regressGrossRi,ton
32:1097:86658:18:18:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:AvgT urnSimt−1.27Column 2 of Table 7 shows that the slope onAvgT urnSimt−1is posi-
32:1098:86740:18:18:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tive and significant (t= 3.69), and column 5 shows that it remains so when controlling for
32:1099:86830:18:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f4:F undT urni,t−1. In column 6, we consider the regression in which both average turnovers are
32:1100:86922:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:included, along withF undT urni,t−1. In this horserace,AvgT urnSimt−1remains positive
32:1101:87007:18:18:72:539:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and significant whereasAvgT urnt−1turns insignificant. The variable that better captures
32:1102:87095:18:28:72:487:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:commonality in turnover is thus more important in predicting fund performance.
32:1103:87173:28:18:89:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We have shown that a fund’s performance is predictable not only by the fund’s own
32:1104:87254:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover but also by the average turnover of other funds, especially similar funds. We have
32:1105:87345:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:motivated this result in the context of our model, based on the commonality in turnover
32:1106:87432:18:18:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and measurement error. The turnover of other funds can also predict performance for other
32:1107:87521:18:18:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:reasons that are outside the model. For example, in the model, funds always trade optimally,
32:1108:87613:18:29:72:539:443:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but suboptimal trading can also create a predictive role forAvgT urnt−1, as we explain next.
32:1109:87705:29:18:89:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Suppose that funds trade suboptimally, so that only a fraction of a typical fund’s turnover
32:1110:87796:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:involves exploiting true profit opportunities. Also suppose that funds’ profit opportunities
32:1111:87888:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are positively correlated. This setting can arise, for example, if some stocks are mispriced
32:1112:87980:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:while others are not, funds trade both types of stocks (the latter erroneously), and the
32:1113:88068:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:degree of mispricing in the former stocks varies over time in a way that many funds can

32:1115:88244:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:mately uncorrelated, heavier trading by other funds indicates more mispricing. Therefore,

32:1117:88416:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher—and fundi’s subsequent performance is better—when fundi’s own manager identifies
32:1118:88503:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more profit opportunities. When many managers identify such opportunities,AvgT urnt−1is
32:1119:88590:18:18:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher, and there is more mispricing in general. Even when a fund’s own manager does not
32:1120:88678:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:identify unusually many opportunities in a given period, the opportunities he does identify
32:1121:88769:18:29:72:497:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are likely to be more profitable if there is generally more mispricing in that period.
32:1122:88855:29:18:89:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The same story can also explain whyAvgT urnSimt−1drives outAvgT urnt−1in column
32:1123:88934:18:17:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:6 of Table 7.  If trading by other funds signals the presence of greater mispricing, then
32:1124:89023:17:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:heavier trading by funds similar to one’s own could signal greater mispricing that is especially
32:1125:89119:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relevant. In other words, heavier trading by less-similar funds could be less relevant to one’s
32:1126:89214:18:18:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:own fund. This possibility is consistent with our evidence that the turnover of one’s own

33:1128:89389:0:51:72:399:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fund typically comoves more with the turnover of similar funds.
33:1129:89452:51:40:72:203:672:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:6.  Conclusions
33:1130:89467:40:18:72:540:632:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We develop a model of fund trading in the presence of time-varying profit opportunities. The
33:1131:89559:18:18:72:540:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:model’s key implication is a positive time-series relation between an active fund’s turnover
33:1132:89651:18:18:72:541:596:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and its subsequent benchmark-adjusted return. We find strong support for this implication
33:1133:89740:18:18:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in a comprehensive sample of equity mutual funds. Funds exhibit an ability to identify time-
33:1134:89832:18:18:72:541:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:varying profit opportunities and adjust their trading activity accordingly. This time-series
33:1135:89924:18:18:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:relation between turnover and performance is stronger than the cross-sectional relation, as
33:1136:90015:18:18:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:our model predicts. The model also predicts a stronger time-series relation for funds trading
33:1137:90108:18:17:72:540:506:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:less-liquid stocks. Indeed, we find a stronger relation for small-stock funds and small funds.
33:1138:90202:17:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We also find a stronger relation for funds with higher fees, consistent with such funds having
33:1139:90296:18:29:72:379:471:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:greater skill in identifying time-varying profit opportunities.
33:1140:90359:29:18:89:540:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:We provide strong evidence of commonality in mutual fund turnover. Turnover’s common
33:1141:90443:18:18:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:component, average turnover, is positively correlated with mispricing proxies. Funds trade
33:1142:90533:18:18:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:more when investor sentiment is high, when cross-sectional stock volatility is high, and when
33:1143:90626:18:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:stock market liquidity is low, consistent with funds identifying more profit opportunities
33:1144:90716:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in periods when mispricing is more likely. The common component of turnover positively
33:1145:90802:18:18:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:predicts fund returns, even controlling for the fund’s own turnover. This predictive ability of
33:1146:90897:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:average turnover is consistent with an individual fund’s observed turnover being a noisy proxy
33:1147:90991:18:18:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for the fund’s true turnover. Turnover’s common component helps capture a fund’s true
33:1148:91076:18:17:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover and thereby helps predict the fund’s performance. Average turnover’s predictive
33:1149:91164:17:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ability is also consistent with suboptimal trading by funds, where only some trades exploit
33:1150:91255:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:true profit opportunities.  Whatever true opportunities a fund does identify are likely to
33:1151:91345:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be more profitable when turnover’s common component is high. Commonality in turnover
33:1152:91429:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is especially high among funds sharing similar characteristics, and a fund’s performance is
33:1153:91520:18:29:72:433:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:predicted even more strongly by the average turnover of similar funds.
33:1154:91590:29:18:89:540:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Heavier trading by funds when mispricing is more likely underscores the role of active
33:1155:91676:18:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:management in the price discovery process. While the active management industry may not
33:1156:91763:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:provide superior net returns to its investors (consistent with both theory and evidence), it
33:1157:91855:18:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:creates a valuable externality. The combined trading of many funds helps correct prices and
33:1158:91946:18:18:72:540:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thereby enables more efficient capital allocation. French (2008) characterizes his estimated
33:1159:92038:18:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cost of active management as a societal cost of price discovery. Stambaugh’s (2014) calibra-
33:1160:92130:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion of a general equilibrium model implies that active management corrects a large portion
34:1161:92223:0:18:72:540:723:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the mispricing that would otherwise exist in the presence of noise traders. Our results
34:1162:92313:18:18:72:540:705:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:support this view of active management’s societal value, given our evidence that funds have
34:1163:92404:18:29:72:483:687:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:skill and that they more actively apply that skill when mispricing is more likely.
34:1164:92486:29:18:89:539:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Our study could be extended in several directions. For example, while we relate funds’
34:1165:92572:18:18:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:turnover to their future performance, it could also be interesting to relate turnover to fund
34:1166:92665:18:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:flows. Such analysis would reveal whether fund investors are aware of turnover’s ability to
34:1167:92756:17:18:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:predict returns. In the Berk and Green (2004) model, investors respond to fund returns,
34:1168:92843:18:18:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but our results suggest that they might also benefit from responding to turnover. Another
34:1169:92932:18:18:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:promising direction is to go beyond turnover and analyze the funds’ trading activity in more
34:1170:93024:18:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:detail. For example, one could analyze changes in fund holdings or adjust turnover for non-
34:1171:93115:18:18:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:discretionary trading. Such analysis could potentially produce even more powerful predictors
34:1172:93207:18:18:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of future fund performance.  Finally, finding exogenous variation in profit opportunities
34:1173:93296:18:18:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and funds’ ability to exploit them would help identify any causal relations between fund
34:1174:93384:18:0:72:485:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:performance, trading, and mispricing. We leave these challenges for future work.
