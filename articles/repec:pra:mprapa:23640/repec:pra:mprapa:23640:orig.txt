2:19:318:21:16:90:525:529:144:Times:144:Times:While most studies looking at the consequences of tenurial insecurity on land markets in 
2:20:407:16:16:90:525:513:144:Times:144:Times:developing  countries  focus  on  the effects  of  tenurial  insecurity  on  the  investment 
2:21:499:16:15:90:526:497:144:Times:144:Times:behavior  of  landowners,  this  paper studies  the  hitherto  unexplored relationship  between  
2:22:596:15:16:90:524:482:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity and contract choice in land tenancy. Based on a distinct feature of the 
2:23:688:16:16:90:525:466:144:Times:144:Times:interaction between formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments 
2:24:775:16:16:90:525:450:144:Times:144:Times:the  canonical  model  of  share  tenancy  by  making  the  strength  of  the  landlord’s  property  
2:25:876:16:16:90:524:434:144:Times:144:Times:right   increasing   in   the   amount   of   risk   she   chooses   to   bear   within   the   contract. 
2:26:982:16:16:90:522:418:144:Times:144:Times:Sharecropping  may  thus emerge  as  the optimal  contract even when  the  tenant  is  risk-
2:27:1074:16:16:90:526:402:144:Times:144:Times:neutral.  Using  data  on  landlords’  subjective  perceptions  of  tenurial  insecurity  in  a  rural  
2:28:1178:16:15:90:525:386:144:Times:144:Times:area of Madagascar, empirical tests strongly support the hypothesis that insecure property 
2:29:1269:15:16:89:528:371:144:Times:144:Times:rights  drive  contract  choice while  offering  little  support  in  favor  of  the  canonical  
2:30:1366:16:16:89:403:355:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis that risk sharing considerations drive contract choice.

3:48:2764:0:27:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:1. Introduction 
3:49:2779:27:27:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:What are the impacts of tenurial insecurity on the behavior of individuals and households in 
3:50:2872:27:28:72:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:developing countries? Do weak property rights push landowners to underinvest in improving 
3:51:2962:28:28:72:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:their plots of land? Does tenurial insecurity make landowners who no longer can or want to 
3:52:3053:28:27:72:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:exploit their land think twice about leasing out their plots of land and becoming landlords? Do 
3:53:3149:27:28:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:weak property rights force landlords to discriminate between potential tenants? More generally, 
3:54:3245:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:what actions, if any, are taken by landowners in developing countries to hedge against the risk of 
3:55:3344:28:27:72:225:515:144:Times:144:Times:losing their claim to their land? 
3:56:3377:27:28:72:75:488:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:57:3377:28:27:72:495:460:144:Times:144:Times:Although there exists an important literature on the impacts of tenurial insecurity on the 
3:58:3468:27:28:72:527:433:144:Times:144:Times:investment behavior of landowners (see Jacoby et al. 2002; Carter and Olinto 2003; Deininger 
3:59:3561:28:28:72:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:and Jin 2003 and 2006; Field 2005; and Goldstein and Udry 2008 for recent studies), the impacts 
3:60:3657:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:of tenurial insecurity on other aspects of the land market (i.e., land sales, land tenancy, etc.) are 
3:61:3759:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:relatively less well-known. Conning and Robinson (2007) develop a general equilibrium model 
3:62:3850:28:27:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:in which landowners adopt inefficient measures in an effort to curb tenurial insecurity and find 
3:63:3947:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:support for their model when testing it using data from India. Similarly, Deininger et al. (2009) 
3:64:4045:28:28:72:499:267:144:Times:144:Times:report evidence that suggests that tenurial insecurity prevents the land lease market from 
3:65:4136:28:27:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:functioning efficiently in Ethiopia, a finding echoed by Lunduka et al. (2009), who find that 
3:66:4230:27:28:72:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity also constrains the functioning of the land market in Malawi. Finally, Macours 
3:67:4329:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:et al. (2010) find that tenurial insecurity adversely affects the matching of landlords and tenants 
3:68:4429:27:28:72:493:157:144:Times:144:Times:in Nicaragua, as it forces landlords to contract with socio-economically similar tenants.

4:70:4521:0:28:72:536:709:144:Times:144:Times:This paper studies the impact of tenurial insecurity on the tenancy contracts landlords offer their 
4:71:4621:28:27:72:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:tenants. Based on field observations as well as conversations with rural landowners in 
4:72:4708:27:28:72:509:654:144:Times:144:Times:Madagascar, this paper first develops a transaction cost-based alternative hypothesis to the 
4:73:4801:28:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:canonical risk sharing explanation. Indeed, since the seminal contribution of Stiglitz (1974), the 
4:74:4900:28:27:71:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:canonical explanation for the existence of sharecropping has been that it balances out risk 
4:75:4992:27:28:71:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:sharing and incentives. So when the landlord is risk-neutral or risk-averse and the tenant is risk-
4:76:5091:28:28:71:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:averse, a sharecropping contract dominates a fixed rent contract because it partially insures the 
4:77:5189:28:27:71:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:tenant against production risk while still tying pay to performance. When the tenant is risk-
4:78:5282:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:neutral, however, there is no longer a need to insure the tenant against production risk, so that a 
4:79:5382:28:27:71:250:460:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent contract becomes optimal. 
4:80:5418:27:28:71:74:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:81:5418:28:28:71:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:Because sharecropping has been observed in both high- and low-risk environments, however, 
4:82:5508:28:27:71:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:another school of thought – the transaction costs school of thought – posits that sharecropping 
4:83:5604:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:emerges because the presence of one or more transaction costs which make sharecropping more 
4:84:5696:28:27:71:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:attractive relative to fixed rent (Cheung 1968; Allen and Lueck 2002).  It could be the case, for 
4:85:5794:27:28:71:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:example, that the tenant is risk-neutral but that a fixed rent contract would push him to deplete 
4:86:5892:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:soil fertility by virtue of providing him with stronger incentives given that he gets to keep the 
4:87:5990:28:27:71:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:entire crop. In this case, the landlord could choose a sharecropping contract in order to preserve 
4:88:6089:27:28:71:486:212:144:Times:144:Times:soil fertility, a hypothesis for which Dubois (2002) has found empirical support in the 
4:89:6177:28:27:71:132:184:144:Times:144:Times:Philippines. 
4:90:6190:27:28:71:74:157:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:91:6190:28:28:71:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:The theoretical framework developed in this paper explains sharecropping as a result of an 
4:92:6281:28:0:71:505:101:144:Times:144:Times:important transaction cost, viz. tenurial insecurity. That is, if the strength of the landlord's 
5:93:6380:0:28:72:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:property right is an increasing function of the production risk she chooses to bear (e.g., as she 
5:94:6478:28:27:72:490:681:144:Times:144:Times:would in a fixed rent contract relative to a sharecropping contract), she might choose a 
5:95:6567:27:28:72:531:654:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping contract even when the tenant is risk-neutral, even though such a contract leaves 
5:96:6663:28:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:her exposed to a sub-optimal amount of production risk and leads to moral hazard, at least in 
5:97:6757:28:27:72:122:598:144:Times:65:Times:principle.1

5:100:6770:55:27:72:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:The hypothesis developed in this paper is rooted in the interaction between the formal legal 
5:101:6863:27:28:72:540:516:144:Times:144:Times:system and customary rights in Madagascar. Indeed, both the law and customs hold that property 
5:102:6958:28:28:72:492:488:144:Times:144:Times:is a reward that varies in proportion with the effort one puts in cultivating the land, and 
5:103:7050:28:27:72:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:economists have long recognized the disincentive effects of sharecropping relative to rental 
5:104:7143:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:contracts when it comes to agricultural productivity. Moreover, the administration of lands is 
5:105:7238:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:often left to village elders in Madagascar, and there seems to be a collective distaste for landlords 
5:106:7340:28:27:72:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:who do not bear enough of the risk inherent in cultivating own plots, as in the case of a 
5:107:7430:27:28:72:338:350:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping contract relative to a fixed rent contract. 
5:108:7487:28:27:72:75:322:144:Times:144:Times: 
5:109:7487:27:28:72:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:After incorporating tenurial insecurity in the canonical model, this paper then uses on the 
5:110:7579:28:28:72:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:landlords’ subjective perceptions of tenurial insecurity to test whether these drive contract 
5:111:7673:28:27:72:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:choice. Using plot-level data from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar’s most premier rice-growing region, 
5:112:7768:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:contract choice equations are estimated that control for both the matching process and the match 
5:113:7865:28:29:72:519:184:144:Times:144:Times:between the landlord and the tenant. The data ultimately strongly support the hypothesis that 
5:114:7959:29:7:72:219:155:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:115:8007:7:17:72:542:148:42:Times:99:Times:1 See Shaban (1987), Arcand et al. (2007), and Jacoby and Mansuri (2009) for evidence in favor of moral hazard in 
5:116:8121:17:11:71:542:131:99:Times:99:Times:India and Pakistan, respectively. Sadoulet et al. (1997), however, find that contracts between kin eliminate the moral 
5:117:8240:11:12:71:542:120:99:Times:99:Times:hazard  problem  in  the  Philippines.  Likewise,  Kassie  and  Holden  (2007)  find  that  the  threat  of  eviction  eliminates  
5:118:8371:12:11:71:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:moral  hazard  in  Ethiopia,  but  that  this  effect  disappears  in  contracts  between  kin.  Lastly,  Braido  (2008)  finds  no  
5:119:8504:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:evidence  of  moral  hazard  due  to  sharecropping  in  India,  finding  instead  that  the  efficiency  loss  arises  because  
5:120:8633:11:12:71:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:sharecropping  typically  occurs  on  lower-quality  land  than  fixed  rent.  Given  data  limitations,  it  is  not  possible  to  
5:121:8766:12:0:71:357:74:99:Times:99:Times:conduct a cleanly identified test of moral hazard in the present context. 
6:122:8841:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity drives contract choice but offer little to no support in favor of the canonical 
6:123:8941:28:27:72:492:681:144:Times:144:Times:risk sharing hypothesis. In short, for a one-percent increase in the landlord’s subjective 
6:124:9032:27:28:71:509:654:144:Times:144:Times:perception of the degree of tenurial insecurity, the likelihood of observing a sharecropping 
6:125:9125:28:28:71:292:626:144:Times:144:Times:contract increases by two percent on average.

6:127:9171:27:28:71:534:571:144:Times:144:Times:This paper therefore offers a threefold contribution to the literature. First and foremost, whereas 
6:128:9271:28:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:the majority of studies looking at tenurial insecurity focus on investment, this paper studies the

6:132:9480:27:28:71:481:433:144:Times:144:Times:Second, this paper contributes to the growing literature on subjective expectations in

6:142:10214:28:27:72:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:tenancy,” i.e., land tenancy in which the landlord is poorer than the tenant, which is very 
6:143:10306:27:25:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:frequent in Madagascar (Minten and Razafindraibe, 2003) and which has also been observed in

6:145:10446:7:17:72:542:125:42:Times:99:Times:2  Given  that  data  collection  focused  on  the  contracts  themselves  and  not  on  land  redistribution  mechanisms  or 
6:146:10571:17:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:village-level institutions, this paper  takes tenurial  insecurity  as  given.  Although  it would be of interest to open the 
6:147:10697:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:“black  box”  of  tenurial  insecurity  and  land  redistribution,  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper  to  do  so.  Bellemare  
6:148:10834:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:(2009) studies the determinants of the subjective expectations used in this paper and finds that few, if any, variables 
6:149:10954:12:0:71:290:74:99:Times:99:Times:explain how these subjective expectations are formed. 
7:150:11009:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:places as diverse as Bangladesh (Pearce 1983), Eritrea (Tikabo 2003), Ethiopia (Bezabih 2007), 
7:151:11104:28:27:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:India (Singh 1989), Lesotho (Lawry 1993), Malaysia (Pearce 1983), the Philippines (Roumasset 
7:152:11196:27:28:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:2002), and South Africa (Lyne and Thomson 1995). In such cases, however, if tenants are risk-
7:153:11289:28:28:72:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:neutral (or act as if risk-neutral because they have better opportunities for diversifying risk or 
7:154:11388:28:27:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:better access to insurance by virtue of being wealthier), the canonical model is inconsistent with 
7:155:11487:27:28:71:508:571:144:Times:144:Times:the existence of reverse share tenancy, and it needs to be modified to account for whatever 
7:156:11579:28:28:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:makes the existence of reverse share tenancy possible. This paper modifies the canonical model 
7:157:11674:28:27:71:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:so as to accommodate the existence of reverse share tenancy if tenants can indeed be assumed to 
7:158:11770:27:83:71:149:488:144:Times:65:Times:be risk-neutral.3
7:159:11787:83:0:72:75:405:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:160:11787:0:28:149:503:488:144:Times:144:Times: Moreover, if the tenurial insecurity hypothesis developed in this paper is 
7:161:11863:28:27:72:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:supported by the data, it may be useful to know whether tenurial insecurity plays a more 
7:162:11952:27:55:72:513:433:144:Times:144:Times:important role for landlords who are poorer than their tenants than for the average landlord. 
7:163:12045:55:28:72:513:378:144:Times:144:Times:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, some background on land 
7:164:12136:28:28:72:488:350:144:Times:144:Times:tenancy and the contractual environment in Madagascar is given with emphasis on the 
7:165:12220:28:27:72:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:interaction between formal and informal institutions that combine to give rise to tenurial 
7:166:12311:27:28:72:480:295:144:Times:144:Times:insecurity. Section 3 extends the canonical principal-agent model of land tenancy by 
7:167:12396:28:28:72:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:endogenizing the strength of the landlord’s property right to make it a  function of the contract 
7:168:12494:28:27:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:terms, thereby introducing a potentially important transaction cost. In section 4, the empirical 
7:169:12591:27:28:71:532:212:144:Times:144:Times:framework used to test the tenurial insecurity hypothesis developed in this paper along with the 
7:170:12688:28:27:71:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:usual risk sharing hypothesis is presented, giving special attention to identification and testing 
7:171:12787:27:28:71:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:strategies. Section 5 presents the data and some descriptive statistics. In section 6, the estimation 
7:172:12889:28:31:71:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:results are presented,  and hypothesis tests are conducted which offer strong support for the 
7:173:12983:31:8:72:219:98:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:174:13031:8:16:72:543:90:42:Times:99:Times:3 Indeed, if no one could be assumed risk-neutral or to act as if risk-neutral because of better opportunities for risk 
7:175:13151:16:0:71:502:74:99:Times:99:Times:diversification or better access to insurance, one would never observe fixed rent contracts in the real world. 
8:176:13263:0:28:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity hypothesis but only limited support for the risk sharing hypothesis. Section 7

8:180:13413:28:27:72:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:The tenurial insecurity hypothesis put forth in this paper may seem prima facie surprising. 
8:181:13504:27:28:71:480:571:144:Times:144:Times:Although the impacts of eviction threats on tenant behavior have been explored both 
8:182:13588:28:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:theoretically (Banerjee and Ghatak 2004) and empirically (Kassie and Holden 2007 and 2009), 
8:183:13680:28:27:71:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:the hypothesis that the strength of a landlord’s claim to her plot of land could be a function of 
8:184:13778:27:28:71:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:how much risk she chooses to bear when leasing her plot out is unheard of under more familiar 
8:185:13872:28:27:71:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e., Western) legal systems. Yet this was the reason invoked by several landowners for 
8:186:13961:27:28:71:541:433:144:Times:144:Times:choosing sharecropping over fixed rent during preliminary visits to Madagascar, where landlords 
8:187:14057:28:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:who choose not to bear any production risk are often perceived as uninterested in their land and 
8:188:14154:28:27:71:312:377:144:Times:144:Times:are thus discussed with contempt by third parties. 
8:189:14204:27:28:71:74:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
8:190:14204:28:27:71:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, in his chapter on tenure security in Madagascar, Teyssier (1998) notes how the Lac 
8:191:14295:27:28:71:501:295:144:Times:144:Times:Alaotra region, where the data used in this paper have been collected, has been attracting 
8:192:14386:28:27:71:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:migrants since the 19th century. For the Sihanaka (i.e., the dominant ethnic group in Lac 
8:193:14476:27:28:71:533:240:144:Times:144:Times:Alaotra), the land belongs to the individuals who were born on it. The land where one was born 
8:194:14571:28:28:71:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:is therefore not perceived only as simply production input: in a country where the cult of the 
8:195:14666:28:27:71:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:ancestors regiments one’s existence, it also serves as a link between one and one’s ancestors. 
8:196:14761:27:28:71:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:Teyssier (1998, 586) writes that for other ethnic groups, who have composed the bulk of the 
8:197:14853:28:27:71:253:129:144:Times:144:Times:immigration to Lac Alaotra, however 
8:198:14888:27:0:71:74:102:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:199:14890:0:16:72:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:“[t] he land belongs to the individual who cultivates it. This conception is also that of the 
9:200:14984:16:16:72:503:693:144:Times:144:Times:central government, for whom the titling of a portion of the private national domain in an 
9:201:15075:16:16:72:518:677:144:Times:144:Times:individual’s name is necessarily associated with previous cultivation by the same individual. 
9:202:15169:16:16:72:494:661:144:Times:144:Times:Property is thus conceived of as a ‘reward’ that varies in proportion to the effort put in 
9:203:15260:16:16:72:268:645:144:Times:144:Times:cultivating the land.” [ Emphasis added.] 
9:204:15301:16:27:71:74:629:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:205:15301:27:28:71:532:602:144:Times:144:Times:Recall that in the canonical principal-agent model of land tenancy (Stiglitz 1974), the provision 
9:206:15399:28:27:71:529:574:144:Times:144:Times:of effort by the tenant is curbed by the weaker incentives provided by a sharecropping contract 
9:207:15495:27:28:71:522:547:144:Times:144:Times:relative to a fixed rent contract.  It is likely that this is directly taken into account by landlords 
9:208:15598:28:28:71:538:519:144:Times:144:Times:when contemplating whether to offer their tenants a sharecropping or a fixed rent contract. In his 
9:209:15697:28:27:71:508:491:144:Times:144:Times:descriptive study of sharecropping in Lac Alaotra, Charmes (1975) notes how landlords in 
9:210:15785:27:28:71:536:464:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping contracts are almost always involved in some aspect of production (e.g., plowing, 
9:211:15881:28:27:71:535:436:144:Times:144:Times:pricking out, harvesting, threshing, husking, and milling), whereas the involvement of landlords 
9:212:15978:27:28:71:523:409:144:Times:144:Times:in fixed rent contracts is only consists in providing the plot of land on which production takes 
9:213:16075:28:28:71:106:381:144:Times:144:Times:place.  
9:214:16083:28:27:71:74:353:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:215:16083:27:28:71:517:326:144:Times:144:Times:Likewise, in his case study of the informal economy of lower Antananarivo, Turcotte (2006, 
9:216:16174:28:27:71:489:298:144:Times:144:Times:330) hints at the fact that tenurial insecurity drives contract choice when he writes that 
9:217:16264:27:28:71:74:271:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:218:16264:28:16:71:481:243:144:Times:144:Times:“[a]ccess to rice is related to the property rights which some individuals still have on 
9:219:16353:16:16:71:514:227:144:Times:144:Times:inherited plots (...). Although it occurs that rice plots owned in the countryside (or in town) 
9:220:16449:16:16:71:503:211:144:Times:144:Times:are not exploited or are exploited by and for someone else, one is more likely to lease out 
9:221:16541:16:16:71:506:195:144:Times:144:Times:such plots under a sharecropping agreement to one’s kin or to someone whom one trusts.”

9:224:16652:28:28:71:538:136:144:Times:144:Times:What conditions lead to the emergence of a land rights system in which the terms of the contract 
9:225:16749:28:27:71:522:108:144:Times:144:Times:chosen by the landlord affect her likelihood of retaining her claim to the land? As is often the 
9:226:16846:27:0:71:517:81:144:Times:144:Times:case in Sub-Saharan Africa (Platteau 2000), formal legal institutions coexist with customary 
10:227:16941:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:rights in Madagascar. According to Karsenty and Le Roy (1996), land is conceived of as the land 
10:228:17037:28:27:72:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:of the ancestors in Madagascar, and in rural areas, the activities of the living largely focus on 
10:229:17135:27:28:72:538:654:144:Times:144:Times:preserving the land of the ancestors. Consequently, land can only become private property if it is 
10:230:17234:28:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:titled, the process leading to which is not only extremely slow and costly in terms of both time 
10:231:17331:28:27:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:and money, but also perceived as useless by 25 percent of Minten and Razafindraibe’s (2003) 
10:232:17423:27:28:72:526:571:144:Times:144:Times:respondents. In many communities the administration of plots is left to the village elders, who 
10:233:17519:28:28:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:allocate plots to members of the clan. Further, Malagasy tradition holds that (i) taking possession 
10:234:17619:28:27:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:of the fruits of the land; and (ii) bearing agricultural risk both ensure continued access to the 
10:235:17717:27:28:72:471:488:144:Times:144:Times:land, much as direct cultivation does under more familiar property rights regimes.  
10:236:17800:28:27:72:75:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:237:17800:27:28:72:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:Formal institutions which may have been put in place so as to make informal institutions official 
10:238:17898:28:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:also contribute to the landlords’ perceptions of tenurial insecurity in Madagascar. First, under 
10:239:17995:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:Western property rights regimes, one often encounters the legal doctrine of adverse possession, 
10:240:18091:27:28:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:which holds that an individual may take possession of a plot of land belonging to another by 
10:241:18184:28:27:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:occupying or exploiting it for a certain amount of time (Posner 2007). In Madagascar, Keck et al. 
10:242:18281:27:28:72:173:295:144:Times:144:Times:(1994, 47) write that

10:246:18486:16:16:72:507:208:144:Times:144:Times:prerogatives defined by the greater public good. Thus, property took on a more prominent 
10:247:18575:16:16:72:521:192:144:Times:144:Times:social function; individuals unable to use the land had no right to keep it, and the land was to 
10:248:18672:16:16:72:308:176:144:Times:144:Times:be transferred to a more productive owner/user.”

10:250:18720:27:28:71:524:133:144:Times:144:Times:It is thus possible for a tenant to obtain his landlord’s plot legally through adverse possession, 
10:251:18819:28:28:71:504:105:144:Times:144:Times:which is often dependent on the general attitude towards rights to future use, about which 
10:252:18910:28:0:71:510:77:144:Times:144:Times:Posner (2007, 49) writes that it is itself “related to the age-old hostility to speculation – the 
11:253:19010:0:28:72:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:purchase of a good not to use but to hold in the hope that it will appreciate in value.” Even

11:264:19749:28:28:72:505:452:144:Times:144:Times:according to the formal legal system in Madagascar, if a landlord wishes to maximize her 
11:265:19838:28:27:72:533:424:144:Times:144:Times:chances of keeping her claim to her plot of land, she may be better off bearing some production 
11:266:19934:27:28:72:527:397:144:Times:144:Times:risk by offering her tenant a sharecropping rather than a fixed rent contract. In the data used in 
11:267:20033:28:27:72:523:369:144:Times:144:Times:the application below, 48 percent of fixed rent tenants versus 40 percent of sharecroppers had 
11:268:20128:27:28:72:224:342:144:Times:144:Times:invested in improving the land.

11:270:20159:28:27:72:505:286:144:Times:144:Times:Lastly, the land sales market is exceptionally thin in Madagascar, where only 3 percent of

11:272:20344:28:27:72:533:231:144:Times:144:Times:reported having sold land in the last five years and only 13 percent of the plots in the nationally 
11:273:20444:27:28:72:522:204:144:Times:144:Times:representative data set used by Minten and Razafindraibe (2003) had been purchased by their 
11:274:20536:28:28:72:536:176:144:Times:144:Times:owners. The land rental market is comparatively more active with almost 8 percent of cultivated 
11:275:20632:28:27:72:510:148:144:Times:144:Times:land under some form of tenancy. According to Randrianarisoa and Minten, the land rental 
11:276:20721:27:28:72:518:121:144:Times:144:Times:market mostly allows households from the middle of the income distribution to lease in land 
11:277:20813:28:0:72:288:93:144:Times:144:Times:from both poorer and wealthier households.

12:284:21343:28:28:72:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:plots are under reverse share tenancy, i.e., sharecropping in which the landlord is poorer than the

12:288:21474:27:28:72:526:433:144:Times:144:Times:This section develops a dynamic principal-agent model in which sharecropping can emerge as 
12:289:21564:28:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:the optimal contract even when the tenant is risk-neutral. This result hinges upon the presence of 
12:290:21663:28:27:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity, in a way such that the more (less) production risk is borne by the landlord, the 
12:291:21765:27:28:72:324:350:144:Times:144:Times:stronger (weaker) her subsequent claim to the land.

12:293:21818:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:The model developed in this section thus nests both the canonical principal-agent model of share 
12:294:21915:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:tenancy as well as the transaction cost-based explanation developed in this paper. As such, it is 
12:295:22013:28:27:72:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:closely related to that of Dubois (2002), but with one important difference: whereas in Dubois’ 
12:296:22109:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:model, the terms of the contract influence future production possibilities via tenant effort, in this 
12:297:22211:28:27:72:431:184:144:Times:144:Times:paper, the terms of the contract affect the landlord’s (expected) plot value.

16:383:25687:28:32:72:534:365:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity, the landlord offers the tenant a sequence of fixed rent contracts, i.e.,

16:385:25876:33:27:72:530:300:144:Times:144:Times:land, the more likely she is to offer the tenant a fixed rent contract. Conversely, the weaker her

17:396:26617:28:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:insecurity has no effect on the probability of observing a sharecropping contract relative to the

17:402:26944:28:27:71:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:The core specification of the contract choice equation to be estimated in this paper is such that 
17:403:27041:27:28:71:74:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:404:27041:28:28:290:491:405:144:Times:144:Times:,     (11) 
17:405:27047:28:28:72:75:377:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:406:27047:28:28:72:474:349:144:Times:144:Times:where i denotes the plot;  if plot i is under fixed rent and  if it is under 
17:407:27124:28:28:72:521:321:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping; , , and  are vectors of plot-, landlord household- and tenant household-
17:408:27211:28:28:72:532:293:144:Times:144:Times:specific characteristics;  is the variable of interest, a discussion of which can be found below; 
17:409:27309:28:28:72:535:265:144:Times:144:Times:and  is an error term with mean zero. Equation 11 is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) 
17:410:27404:28:28:72:534:237:144:Times:144:Times:with robust standard errors, and thus constitutes a reduced form linear probability model (LPM) 
17:411:27500:28:27:72:166:209:144:Times:144:Times:of contract choice.  
17:412:27520:27:28:72:75:182:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:413:27520:28:28:72:541:154:144:Times:144:Times:One could estimate a probit or a logit instead of an LPM, but the latter is chosen so as to simplify 
17:414:27621:28:27:72:498:126:144:Times:144:Times:the interpretation of the estimated coefficients. In the LPM defined by equation 11, each 
17:415:27711:27:0:72:540:99:144:Times:144:Times:estimated coefficient can be interpreted as the percentage change in the likelihood of observing a 
18:416:27813:0:28:72:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent contract rather than a sharecropping contract resulting from a unit change in the 
18:417:27906:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:explanatory variable it is attached to. In addition, while it is common to estimate equation 11 by 
18:418:28005:27:28:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:estimating a probit or a logit because (i) the predictions of the LPM can in principle lie outside 
18:419:28104:28:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:the  interval; and (ii) its error variance is not constant, i.e., its error term is heteroskedastic, 
18:420:28205:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:the goal of this paper is not to forecast contract choice but to study the structural relationships 
18:421:28305:28:28:72:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:between contract choice and a few key explanatory variables; and all equations are estimated 
18:422:28398:28:27:72:532:542:144:Times:144:Times:with robust standard errors. The following sections discuss in turn the identification and testing 
18:423:28497:27:28:72:243:515:144:Times:144:Times:strategies relied upon in this paper.

18:425:28534:27:28:72:200:460:144:Times:144:Times:4.1 Identification Strategy 
18:426:28561:28:28:72:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:Estimating equation 11 would pose no particular problem if  were orthogonal to , , , 
18:427:28646:28:28:72:504:404:144:Times:144:Times:and . In practice, however, endogeneity problems plague the cross-sectional analysis of 
18:428:28734:28:28:71:121:376:144:Times:144:Times:contracts. 
18:429:28744:28:27:72:75:348:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:430:28744:27:28:72:529:321:144:Times:144:Times:A well-known problem is the endogenous matching between landlords and tenants (Ackerberg 
18:431:28833:28:28:72:542:293:144:Times:144:Times:and Botticini 2002). In this context, an endogenous matching problem could arise because wealth 
18:432:28929:28:28:72:531:265:144:Times:144:Times:is used as a proxy for risk aversion. Let  and  denote the wealth levels of the landlord and 
18:433:29022:28:28:72:540:237:144:Times:144:Times:the tenant, which are used here as proxies for risk preferences. In other words, , and 
18:434:29109:28:28:138:508:209:144:Times:144:Times:, where  and  are the landlord and the tenant’s coefficients of absolute or 
18:435:29185:28:28:72:528:181:144:Times:144:Times:relative risk aversion and  and  are error terms included in  when relying on wealth as a 
18:436:29275:28:28:72:542:153:144:Times:144:Times:proxy for risk aversion. But then, if the landlord and the tenant match along risk preferences (i.e., 
18:437:29377:28:28:72:535:125:144:Times:144:Times:if  is correlated with  or  is correlated with ,), the estimated coefficients for the wealth 
18:438:29470:28:0:72:157:97:144:Times:144:Times:levels are biased. 
19:439:29491:0:28:72:75:709:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:440:29491:28:27:72:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:In order to control for the possibility that there is endogenous matching in the data, two types of 
19:441:29591:27:28:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:controls are included. The first is a set of dummy variables that control for how the landlord and 
19:442:29690:28:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:the tenant came to know each other. The second is a set of dummy variables that control for why 
19:443:29786:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:the landlord chose this particular tenant. These two sets of dummy variables are discussed further 
19:444:29885:27:28:72:232:571:144:Times:144:Times:below, when describing the data. 
19:445:29917:28:28:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:446:29917:28:27:72:532:515:144:Times:144:Times:For some, another potentially important endogeneity problem could result from the selection of 
19:447:30012:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:landowners into landlord status. Indeed, Dubois (2002) estimates a two-stage empirical model in 
19:448:30108:28:27:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:which the first-stage equation accounts for the landowner’s selection into landlord status (i.e., the 
19:449:30210:27:28:72:538:433:144:Times:144:Times:decision to lease the plot out) and in which the second-stage equation accounts for the landlord’s 
19:450:30309:28:28:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:choice of contract. This paper does not model the decision to lease out and focuses instead on 
19:451:30404:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:contract choice conditional on the fact that the landowner has chosen to become a landlord.  
19:452:30496:27:28:72:75:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:453:30496:28:27:72:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, it is important for the econometrician to control for selection in a context where one 
19:454:30591:27:28:72:534:295:144:Times:144:Times:wishes to generalize his findings to an entire population. For example, when one wants to know 
19:455:30686:28:28:71:538:267:144:Times:144:Times:whether the vitamin C absorbed from consuming orange juice has positive effects on health, one 
19:456:30781:28:27:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:needs to estimate those impacts for everyone in the population, and not just on the subset of the 
19:457:30879:27:28:71:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:population who already consumes orange juice, who may be consuming orange juice because 
19:458:30967:28:27:71:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:they are a priori more health-conscious individuals. In this context, however, it makes little 
19:459:31061:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:sense to want to generalize the findings of the contract choice equation to everybody, since not 
19:460:31158:28:0:72:539:129:144:Times:144:Times:every landowner is a potential landlord. Consequently, because no attempt is made at controlling 
20:461:31258:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:for the selection of landowners into landlord status, it stands to reason that the findings in section 
20:462:31361:28:27:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:5 below are only valid for the subset of the landowner population that selects into landlord status. 
20:463:31462:27:28:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:464:31462:28:28:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:Ultimately, clean identification is difficult if not impossible to obtain when conducting applied 
20:465:31560:28:27:72:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:work on contracts using cross-sectional data. To generalize to an entire population of landlords, 
20:466:31658:27:28:72:535:571:144:Times:144:Times:the ideal observational data set would include (i) experimentally-derived (rather than estimated) 
20:467:31756:28:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:measures of risk aversion for each landlord and each tenant (Lybbert and Just 2007); and (ii) 
20:468:31850:28:27:72:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:multiple observations for each landlord, each tenant, and each landlord-tenant match so as to 
20:469:31944:27:28:71:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:allow controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity between landlords, tenants, and matches via 
20:470:32039:28:27:71:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:landlord, tenant, and match fixed effects. Such an ideal data set, however, would be extremely 
20:471:32134:27:28:71:503:433:144:Times:144:Times:costly and time-consuming to collect, and nothing guarantees that there would be enough 
20:472:32222:28:28:71:510:405:144:Times:144:Times:variation in the contracts entered by each party or in the landlord-tenant matches observed. 
20:473:32315:28:27:71:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:People tend to contract with the same partners, and they tend to enter to the same contracts over 
20:474:32413:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:and over. As a consequence, in most cases, the best one can do is to include a rich enough set of 
20:475:32511:28:27:71:116:322:144:Times:144:Times:controls. 
20:476:32521:27:28:71:74:295:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:477:32521:28:28:71:171:267:144:Times:144:Times:4.2 Testing Strategy 
20:478:32541:28:27:71:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:This section discusses how the tenurial insecurity hypothesis developed above is tested along 
20:479:32634:27:28:72:408:212:144:Times:144:Times:with the canonical risk sharing hypothesis concurrently in this paper.  
20:480:32705:28:27:72:75:184:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:481:32705:27:28:72:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:To test the risk sharing hypothesis, the landlord's choice of contract is regressed on proxies for 
20:482:32804:28:28:72:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:the landlord and the tenant's risk preferences, as in Laffont and Matoussi (1995), Ackerberg and 
20:483:32901:28:0:72:530:101:144:Times:144:Times:Botticini (2002), Dubois (2002), and Fukunaga and Huffman (2009). Following Bellemare and 
21:484:32994:0:28:72:537:709:144:Times:144:Times:Brown (2010), however, when using wealth or income as a proxy for risk aversion, one can only 
21:485:33088:28:28:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:test that (i) the landlord is risk-neutral or her preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion 
21:486:33190:28:224:72:278:653:144:Times:65:Times:(CARA); and (ii) the agent is risk-neutral.5
21:487:33234:224:0:72:75:429:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:488:33234:0:29:278:540:653:144:Times:144:Times: Letting  and  denote the coefficients attached 
21:489:33282:29:28:72:515:624:144:Times:144:Times:to the landlord and the tenant's wealth levels, one can therefore only test the null hypothesis 
21:490:33378:28:29:201:524:596:144:Times:144:Times: versus the alternative hypothesis . This 
21:491:33420:29:28:72:541:567:144:Times:144:Times:means that a rejection of the null is not very informative in this context, as it only serves to reject 
21:492:33524:28:28:72:527:539:144:Times:144:Times:that the landlord is risk-neutral or her preferences exhibit CARA and the tenant is risk-neutral. 
21:493:33622:28:27:71:528:511:144:Times:144:Times:Moreover, we know from first principles that failing to reject the null is not informative, given 
21:494:33720:27:28:71:522:484:144:Times:144:Times:that it does not allow one to accept the null. At best, failing to reject the null suggests that the 
21:495:33821:28:55:71:365:456:144:Times:144:Times:conditions posed in the null hypothesis may hold in the data. 
21:496:33883:55:28:72:538:401:144:Times:144:Times:Turning to the tenurial insecurity hypothesis, given that the landlord's optimal choice of contract 
21:497:33983:28:28:72:528:373:144:Times:144:Times:in the tenurial insecurity model depends on  rather than on , the following identification 
21:498:34074:28:28:72:532:345:144:Times:144:Times:strategy is adopted. The landlords' subjective perceptions of tenurial insecurity (i.e., the inverse 
21:499:34175:28:27:72:409:317:144:Times:144:Times:of ; that is, ) were elicited as follows during the survey.  
21:500:34235:27:28:72:75:290:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:501:34235:28:28:72:533:262:144:Times:144:Times:Given the contract signed by the landlord with her tenant, the landlord was given 20 tokens and 
21:502:34331:28:27:72:534:234:144:Times:144:Times:asked to distribute them between two boxes, one labeled “0”, and one labeled “1”. The landlord 
21:503:34426:27:28:72:542:207:144:Times:144:Times:was told that the latter box represented a state of the world where she lost her claim to the land as 
21:504:34528:28:27:72:541:179:144:Times:144:Times:a result of the contract signed, whereas the former box represented a state of the world where she 
21:505:34627:27:66:72:526:152:144:Times:144:Times:kept her claim to the land. Data on the landlord's hypothetical perception of tenurial insecurity 
21:506:34725:66:7:72:219:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
21:507:34773:7:0:72:378:79:42:Times:99:Times:5 See section 4 for a precise definition of wealth in the context of this paper. 
22:508:34857:0:56:72:305:709:144:Times:65:Times:under the alternate contract were also collected.6
22:509:34907:56:0:72:75:653:144:Times:144:Times: 
22:510:34907:0:28:305:528:709:144:Times:144:Times: This allows computing the discrete change in 
22:511:34953:28:56:94:467:681:144:Times:144:Times: due to a (hypothetical) change of contracts from sharecropping to fixed rent. 
22:512:35031:56:28:72:530:625:144:Times:144:Times:To do so, let  and  respectively denote the perceived security of tenure of a landlord 
22:513:35118:28:28:72:527:597:144:Times:144:Times:entering a fixed rent or sharecropping contract, and  and  respectively denote the 
22:514:35201:28:84:72:515:569:144:Times:65:Times:hypothetical security of tenure of a landlord entering a fixed rent or sharecropping contract.7
22:515:35296:84:0:72:75:485:144:Times:144:Times: 
22:516:35296:0:28:515:540:569:144:Times:144:Times: The 
22:517:35301:28:28:72:537:541:144:Times:144:Times:variable of interest in testing the tenurial insecurity hypothesis (i.e., ) can then be computed as 
22:518:35400:28:64:72:114:513:144:Times:144:Times:follows: 
22:519:35408:64:32:325:497:449:144:Times:144:Times:,    (12)

22:522:35511:28:27:72:213:361:144:Times:144:Times:and equal to zero otherwise.  
22:523:35541:27:33:72:75:334:144:Times:144:Times: 
22:524:35541:33:31:72:530:301:144:Times:144:Times:Because a takes only two discrete values in the data,  has no curvature, i.e.,  is 
22:525:35624:31:28:72:542:270:144:Times:144:Times:undefined. This allows assuming that  is exogenous in the contract choice equation. Intuitively, 
22:526:35721:28:28:71:525:242:144:Times:144:Times:because there are only two possible values of contract choice, which contract is chosen has no 
22:527:35816:28:27:71:541:214:144:Times:144:Times:effect on the rate at which the likelihood of keeping the land changes as contract choice changes, 
22:528:35915:27:28:71:529:187:144:Times:144:Times:because such a rate is undefined. There are no second-order effects of y on s, so that the rate of 
22:529:36014:28:28:71:518:159:144:Times:144:Times:change in the landlord’s perceived likelihood of keeping her plot due to a change of contract 
22:530:36108:28:22:71:266:131:144:Times:144:Times:choice is exogenous to contract choice.

22:532:36196:7:16:72:542:102:42:Times:99:Times:6  This  is  the  perception  of  tenurial  insecurity  under  the  alternative  contract.  The  two  tenurial  insecurity  questions 
22:533:36330:16:7:71:460:86:99:Times:99:Times:were asked four months apart to eliminate the risk of anchoring (Tversky and Kahneman, 1982). 
22:534:36424:7:0:72:283:79:42:Times:99:Times:7 For all sharecropping contracts in the data, a = 0.5.

23:536:36482:28:28:72:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:In other words, the landlord’s perception of tenure security does not depend on the chosen 
23:537:36573:28:28:72:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:contract but is driven by social norms. The exogeneity of  is further justified by the fact that 
23:538:36670:28:27:72:508:625:144:Times:144:Times:almost 80 percent of landlords have been involved in land tenancy in the past, and so their 
23:539:36762:27:28:72:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:subjective expectations of tenure security were already formed prior to signing the current 
23:540:36854:28:27:72:116:570:144:Times:144:Times:contract. 
23:541:36863:27:32:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
23:542:36863:32:33:72:539:511:144:Times:144:Times:For  then, the null hypothesis is thus  versus the alternative hypothesis , 
23:543:36939:33:27:71:510:478:144:Times:144:Times:i.e., a test of whether the change in perceived security of tenure due to a change in contract 
23:544:37034:27:32:71:533:451:144:Times:144:Times:decreases the likelihood of observing a sharecropping contract. Consequently, rejecting the null 
23:545:37131:32:37:71:538:419:144:Times:144:Times:in favor of  will provide support in favor of the tenurial insecurity hypothesis. Lastly, 
23:546:37221:37:33:108:540:382:144:Times:144:Times: can be interpreted below as the change in the likelihood of observing sharecropping over 
23:547:37311:33:28:72:510:349:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent due to a 100 percent increase in , so  gives the percentage change in the 
23:548:37396:28:28:72:491:321:144:Times:144:Times:likelihood of observing sharecropping over fixed rent due to a 1 percent increase in .

23:550:37483:28:27:72:243:265:144:Times:144:Times:5. Data and Descriptive Statistics 
23:551:37517:27:28:72:525:238:144:Times:144:Times:The data used in this paper were collected by the author in Lac Alaotra, Madagascar, between 
23:552:37610:28:27:72:537:210:144:Times:144:Times:March and August 2004. Lac Alaotra, which lies about 300 km to the northeast Antananarivo, is 
23:553:37704:27:28:71:535:183:144:Times:144:Times:the country's premier region for rice cultivation. Since sharecropping is mostly observed on rice 
23:554:37802:28:0:72:510:155:144:Times:144:Times:plots in Madagascar (Karsenty and Le Roy 1996), that rice is the Malagasy staple, and that 
24:555:37896:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:previous studies of sharecropping in Madagascar focused on Lac Alaotra, it is natural to focus on 
24:556:37994:28:27:72:455:681:144:Times:65:Times:that region for the first formal empirical study of share tenancy in Madagascar.8
24:557:38075:27:0:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
24:558:38075:0:55:455:458:681:144:Times:144:Times: 
24:559:38075:55:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:The survey methodology was as follows. First, the six communes with the highest density of 
24:560:38166:28:27:72:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping around Lac Alaotra were selected from the 2001 commune census conducted by 
24:561:38255:27:28:72:512:571:144:Times:144:Times:Cornell University in collaboration with Madagascar's Institut national de la statistique and 
24:562:38349:28:27:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:Centre national de la recherche appliquée au développement (Minten and Razafindraibe 2003).9 
24:563:38441:27:28:72:533:516:144:Times:144:Times:Then, the two villages with the highest density of sharecropping were chosen in each commune 
24:564:38534:28:28:72:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:after determining the density of sharecropping in each village by going through communal 
24:565:38623:28:27:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:records. In an effort to oversample sharecropping so as to increase precision, five households 
24:566:38718:27:28:72:537:433:144:Times:144:Times:known not to lease in or lease out land were selected, five households known to lease in or lease 
24:567:38816:28:28:72:529:405:144:Times:144:Times:out under a fixed rent contract were selected, and 15 households known to lease in or lease out 
24:568:38912:28:27:72:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:under a sharecropping contract were selected in each village. All households were within the 
24:569:39005:27:28:72:525:350:144:Times:65:Times:sampling frame in each village, and so the end result is a sample of 300 selected households.10

24:574:39288:27:28:72:522:240:144:Times:144:Times:household-level and contract-level data for the landlords of the 300 selected households were 
24:575:39382:28:68:72:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:then collected. The data covered a total of 1,029 plots, 387 of which were under land tenancy. 
24:576:39477:68:8:72:219:144:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
24:577:39525:8:11:72:496:136:42:Times:99:Times:8 See the descriptive studies of sharecropping in Lac Alaotra by Charmes (1975) and Jarosz (1990, 1991). 
24:578:39629:11:12:72:362:125:42:Times:99:Times:9 A commune is roughly the equivalent of a district in the United States. 
24:579:39703:12:16:72:546:113:42:Times:99:Times:10   All descriptive   statistics   and   estimation   results   control   for   the   oversampling   of   households   that   enter   
24:580:39838:16:11:72:542:97:99:Times:99:Times:sharecropping agreements by using sampling weights. Ideally, one should also control for the choice-based nature of 
24:581:39954:11:12:72:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:the sample (Manski and Lerman, 1977). Unfortunately, population proportions at the contract-level have never been 
24:582:40068:12:0:71:461:74:99:Times:99:Times:collected in Madagascar, making the choice-based sampling correction impossible to implement. 
25:583:40164:0:28:72:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:Because of missing data, the empirical application below retains a sample of 353 land tenancy 
25:584:40258:28:27:72:414:681:144:Times:144:Times:contracts. T able 1 defines some of the variables used in the estimation.

25:587:40427:28:27:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:Almost 70 percent of the plots are sharecropped, with the remaining 30 percent leased out under 
25:588:40523:27:28:72:540:571:144:Times:144:Times:a fixed rent contract. T he average plot covers a little over one hectare, is worth about US$650 to

25:591:40685:0:27:355:537:543:144:Times:144:Times: Almost 87 percent of the plots in the 
25:592:40724:27:28:72:541:516:144:Times:144:Times:data are rice plots with the remainder split two to one between lowland and hillside plots, and the 
25:593:40824:28:55:72:403:488:144:Times:144:Times:average plot is 33 walking minutes away from the landlord’s house.  
25:594:40891:55:28:72:531:433:144:Times:144:Times:The average landlord household is composed of 5.5 individuals, a little under half of whom are 
25:595:40986:28:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:dependents ( i.e., under the age of 15 or over the age of 64). About fifteen percent of landlords are 
25:596:41088:28:27:72:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:female, and the average landlord is 53 years old and has five years of formal education. In terms 
25:597:41186:27:28:72:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:of resources, the average landlord household has US$107 worth of assets per capita, and an 
25:598:41277:28:82:72:253:322:144:Times:65:Times:annual income per capita of US$53.13

25:600:41313:0:27:253:512:322:144:Times:144:Times: Lastly, 25 percent of landlords report being liquidity-
25:601:41369:27:28:71:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:constrained, proxied here by whether the landlord or his wife requested a formal or an informal 
25:602:41465:28:78:71:284:267:144:Times:144:Times:loan in the 12 months preceding the survey. 
25:603:41508:78:7:72:219:189:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
25:604:41556:7:11:72:167:182:42:Times:99:Times:11 US$1 ≈ 2000 Ariary. 
25:605:41578:11:16:72:542:171:42:Times:99:Times:12 Due to an error in survey design, both the plot value and the formal title dummy variables had to be imputed. See 
25:606:41695:16:12:72:544:155:99:Times:99:Times:appendix  table  A1  for  the  imputations.  Robustness  checks  were  conducted  that  omitted  these  imputed  variables,  
25:607:41820:12:7:72:284:143:99:Times:99:Times:which did not change the core findings of this paper. 
25:608:41873:7:16:72:543:136:42:Times:99:Times:13  The  value  of  landholdings  is  omitted  from  wealth  calculations  given  that  land  markets  are  extremely  thin  in  
25:609:42002:16:12:72:546:120:99:Times:99:Times:Madagascar.  Minten  and  Razafindraibe  (2003)  report  that  only  13  percent  of  the  plots  in  their  nationally  
25:610:42123:12:11:72:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:representative sample had been purchased by their owners, and that 73 percent of plots had been inherited. While it 
25:611:42239:11:11:72:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:is easy to recover land value in the former case, it is near impossible in the latter case, and although a household’s 
25:612:42358:11:12:72:543:86:99:Times:99:Times:landholdings  are  an  important  factor  in  determining  its  wealth,  its  livestock  holdings,  which  are  included  in  this  
25:613:42490:12:0:72:508:74:99:Times:99:Times:paper’s measure of assets, are often a better indicator of household wealth (Minten and Razafindraibe 2003). 
26:614:42601:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:Turning to tenants, the average tenant household is composed of 5.7 individuals, a little under 
26:615:42697:28:27:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:half of whom are dependents. The average tenant is 39 years old and has six years of formal 
26:616:42789:27:28:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:education. In terms of resources, the average tenant household has US$150 worth of assets per 
26:617:42883:28:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:capita and an annual income per capita of US$54. Lastly, 37 percent of tenants report being 
26:618:42975:28:27:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:liquidity-constrained, also proxied here by whether the tenant or his wife requested a formal or 
26:619:43072:27:28:72:343:571:144:Times:144:Times:an informal loan in the 12 months preceding the survey. 
26:620:43127:28:28:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
26:621:43127:28:27:72:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:Comparing landlords and tenants, household characteristics are mostly similar between parties to 
26:622:43224:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:the contract, but while the levels of income per capita of landlord and tenant households are 
26:623:43318:28:27:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:similar, tenants are on average 41 percent than landlords, given their respective levels of assets 
26:624:43417:27:28:72:530:433:144:Times:144:Times:per capita. Although tenants are on average wealthier than landlords, tenants are more likely to 
26:625:43514:28:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:be liquidity-constrained. This is not inconsistent with the fact that landlords are poorer than their 
26:626:43616:28:27:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:tenants in these data. Indeed, the liquidity constraint dummies measure whether household heads 
26:627:43712:27:28:72:527:350:144:Times:144:Times:or their wives have requested a formal or an informal loan during the 12 months preceding the 
26:628:43806:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:survey. As such, landlords were simply less likely to request loans than their tenants, so that the 
26:629:43906:27:28:72:332:295:144:Times:144:Times:liquidity constraint dummies are really lower bounds. 
26:630:43960:28:28:72:75:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
26:631:43960:28:27:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:As regards the match and the matching process between the average landlord and the average 
26:632:44051:27:28:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:tenant, sixty-five percent of land tenancy agreements in the data are signed between kin, with the 
26:633:44150:28:27:72:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:remainder signed between the landlord and a friend (27 percent) or a stranger introduced by kin 
26:634:44246:27:28:72:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:(5 percent) or someone else (3 percent). The high proportion of kin contracts is consistent with 
26:635:44343:28:0:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:the theoretical hypothesis of tenurial insecurity. Indeed, with tenurial insecurity, contracting with 
27:636:44448:0:28:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:kin might offer partial insurance against adverse possession. Of course, this is merely suggestive, 
27:637:44548:28:27:72:297:681:144:Times:144:Times:as it does not control for confounding factors.

27:639:44596:28:28:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:In cases where the landlord was considering more than one potential tenant, she chose the current 
27:640:44694:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:tenant for his honesty in 14 percent of cases, for his wealth in 8 percent of cases, for his ability to 
27:641:44798:27:28:72:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:bear risk in less than 1 percent of cases, to return a favor in less than 1 percent of cases, and for 
27:642:44900:28:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:other reasons in the remainder of cases. The average landlord spent 1.2 days looking for a tenant 
27:643:44998:28:27:72:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:and considered 1.5 other potential tenants, and the average landlord-tenant match has lasted for

27:647:45205:28:28:72:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e., by whether an observation is a sharecropping or a fixed rent contract) and by type of 
27:648:45298:28:27:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:tenancy (i.e., by whether an observation constitutes a case of “regular” tenancy, in which the 
27:649:45393:27:28:72:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:landlord is wealthier than the tenant, or a case of reverse tenancy, in which the landlord is poorer 
27:650:45494:28:27:72:155:322:144:Times:144:Times:than the tenant).

27:652:45512:28:28:72:506:267:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 indicates that hillside plots are more likely to be leased out under a sharecropping 
27:653:45605:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:contract. If the tenurial insecurity hypothesis developed in this paper turns out to be supported by 
27:654:45706:27:28:72:508:212:144:Times:144:Times:the data, this would be consistent with Teyssier’s (1998) observation that hillside plots are 
27:655:45800:28:27:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:among the most contested ones in Lac Alaotra. Irrigated plots are more likely to be leased out 
27:656:45895:27:28:72:525:157:144:Times:144:Times:under a fixed rent contract. Although landlord individual and household characteristics do not 
27:657:45990:28:28:72:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:differ significantly between sharecropping and fixed rent contracts, sharecroppers tend to be less 
27:658:46089:28:0:72:527:101:144:Times:144:Times:educated and their households tend to have higher dependency ratios than tenants in fixed rent 
28:659:46187:0:28:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:contracts. Sharecroppers also have lower incomes per capita than tenants in fixed rent contracts, 
28:660:46285:28:27:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:suggesting that as his income increases, a tenant becomes more likely to accept bearing more 
28:661:46378:27:28:72:535:654:144:Times:144:Times:risk. This presupposes, however, that risk aversion is decreasing in income, and that income is a 
28:662:46476:28:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:valid proxy for risk aversion. Lastly, when the landlord chooses her tenant in order to return a 
28:663:46573:28:27:72:363:598:144:Times:144:Times:favor, she is more likely to choose a sharecropping contract. 
28:664:46634:27:28:72:75:571:144:Times:144:Times: 
28:665:46634:28:28:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, table 4 indicates that plots under reverse tenancy agreements are more likely to be 
28:666:46729:28:27:72:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:titled than plots under regular tenancy and that plots under reverse tenancy agreements are on 
28:667:46824:27:28:71:533:488:144:Times:144:Times:average further away from the landlord’s house than plots under regular tenancy. Leaving aside 
28:668:46919:28:27:71:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:the wealth difference between landlord and tenants (along which the concepts of regular and 
28:669:47011:27:28:71:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:reverse tenancy are defined in this paper, so that the wealth ordering observed in table 4 is true 
28:670:47110:28:28:71:500:405:144:Times:144:Times:by construction), landlords in reverse tenancy agreements are significantly older and less 
28:671:47201:28:27:71:487:377:144:Times:144:Times:educated, and they have substantially lower incomes than landlords in regular tenancy 
28:672:47287:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:agreements. Although landlords in reverse tenancy agreements are less likely to report being 
28:673:47380:28:27:72:533:322:144:Times:144:Times:liquidity-constrained than landlords in regular tenancy agreements, recall that this variable only 
28:674:47479:27:28:72:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:measures whether the landlord has requested a formal or an informal loan which was then denied 
28:675:47574:28:28:72:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:during the 12 months preceding the survey. Consequently, the sign of the difference likely 
28:676:47665:28:27:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:reflects the landlord selection into requesting loans. Tenants in reverse tenancy agreements have 
28:677:47763:27:28:72:491:212:144:Times:144:Times:significantly smaller households and are more educated than tenants in regular tenancy 
28:678:47850:28:27:72:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:agreements, and they also have substantially higher incomes than tenants in regular tenancy 
28:679:47942:27:28:72:532:157:144:Times:144:Times:agreements. Surprisingly, landlords in sharecropping agreements (table 3) or in reverse tenancy 
28:680:48038:28:28:72:528:129:144:Times:144:Times:(table 4) are neither more likely to be female nor more likely to be elderly, two findings which 
28:681:48135:28:0:72:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:contradict the conventional wisdom about land tenancy in Madagascar (Jarosz 1990 and 1991) 
29:682:48229:0:28:72:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:and about reverse tenancy elsewhere (Bezabih 2007), which often talks of landlords in reverse 
29:683:48323:28:27:72:431:681:144:Times:144:Times:share tenancy agreements being disproportionately single, elderly women.

29:685:48395:28:28:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:Looking at the differences between the landlord-tenant match and the matching process between 
29:686:48489:28:27:72:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:the landlord and the tenant between the regular and reverse tenancy sub-samples, the landlord 
29:687:48583:27:28:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:and the tenant are slightly more likely to be kin under regular than under reverse tenancy, but 
29:688:48679:28:28:72:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:while this difference is statistically significant, it barely registers as economically significant. 
29:689:48780:28:27:72:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:Lastly, tenants in regular tenancy agreements are more likely to have been chosen for their 
29:690:48872:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:honesty or because the landlord owe them a favor than tenants in reverse tenancy agreements.

29:692:48964:27:28:72:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, turning to the variable of interest in this paper, i.e., the subjective expectations of the 
29:693:49065:28:28:72:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:landlord, table 5 reports the average landlord’s perceptions of tenurial security, i.e., her 
29:694:49158:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:subjective perception of the likelihood that she will retain her claim to the land. Table 5 is split 
29:695:49259:27:28:72:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:into three panels. The upper panel of table 5 reports subjective expectations for the full sample of 
29:696:49360:28:27:72:543:322:144:Times:144:Times:all land tenancy contracts in the data. Then, because there is a large proportion of reverse tenancy 
29:697:49461:27:28:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e., contracts in which the landlord is poorer than the tenant) in the data, the middle and bottom 
29:698:49562:28:28:72:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:panels of table 5 respectively report subjective expectations for the “regular” tenancy (i.e., 
29:699:49657:28:27:72:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:contracts in which the landlord is wealthier than the tenant) and reverse tenancy sub-samples. 
29:700:49751:27:28:71:74:212:144:Times:144:Times: 
29:701:49751:28:28:72:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:In all three panels, landlords are highly confident that they will retain their plot of land whether 
29:702:49852:28:28:72:514:156:144:Times:144:Times:one considers actual (i.e., under the contract signed) tenure security ; hypothetical (i.e., 
29:703:49944:28:28:72:541:128:144:Times:144:Times:under the alternative contract) tenure security ; tenure security under sharecropping ; 
29:704:50032:28:0:72:270:100:144:Times:144:Times:or tenure security under fixed rent .  
30:705:50074:0:28:72:75:709:144:Times:144:Times: 
30:706:50074:28:27:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, in all cases, landlords report subjective perceptions of tenure security above 98 percent. 
30:707:50173:27:28:72:498:654:144:Times:144:Times:Such high percentages are not inconsistent with the theoretical model of section 2, since 
30:708:50263:28:28:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:individuals commonly overweight small-probability events (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). 
30:709:50349:28:27:71:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:Nagin et al. (2002), for example, conducted a field experiment in which even a likelihood as low 
30:710:50446:27:28:71:509:571:144:Times:144:Times:as 3 percent of being monitored managed to induce optimal effort on the part of call center 
30:711:50538:28:28:71:496:543:144:Times:144:Times:employees, and recent field experiments in China have shown that farmers significantly 
30:712:50625:28:27:71:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:overweight small-probability events (Liu 2008). In this case, if the tenurial insecurity hypothesis 
30:713:50725:27:28:71:489:488:144:Times:144:Times:for the emergence of share tenancy developed in section 2 is true, landlords seemingly 
30:714:50812:28:27:71:302:460:144:Times:144:Times:overweight the probability of losing their plots. 
30:715:50861:27:28:71:74:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
30:716:50861:28:28:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:More telling is the change in  associated with a move from sharecropping to fixed rent. In all 
30:717:50955:28:32:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:three panels of table 5, a positive change in  is associated with a move from sharecropping to 
30:718:51050:32:33:72:514:345:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent. Using the notation of section 4, this suggests that , which is the empirical 
30:719:51139:33:27:72:497:312:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent of proposition 2 above. Of course, this merely suggests that the hypothesized 
30:720:51228:27:28:72:537:285:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between tenurial insecurity and land tenancy holds in these data given that it fails to 
30:721:51329:28:28:72:530:257:144:Times:144:Times:control for confounding factors. The next section investigates the relationship between tenurial 
30:722:51426:28:27:72:289:229:144:Times:144:Times:insecurity and land tenancy more rigorously. 
30:723:51471:27:28:72:75:202:144:Times:144:Times:

30:725:51491:27:28:72:540:147:144:Times:144:Times:Table 6 presents estimation results for the contract choice equation presented in equation 11. The 
30:726:51590:28:28:72:536:119:144:Times:144:Times:first column reports estimation results for a naïve specification that fails to control for the match 
30:727:51692:28:0:71:522:91:144:Times:144:Times:and the matching process between the landlord and the tenant, and the second column reports 
31:728:51787:0:28:72:503:709:144:Times:144:Times:estimation results for a specification that controls for the match and the matching process 
31:729:51879:28:27:71:249:681:144:Times:144:Times:between the landlord and the tenant. 
31:730:51915:27:28:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
31:731:51915:28:28:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:In the naïve specification in column 1, irrigated plots are more than 20 percent more likely to be 
31:732:52014:28:27:71:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:leased out under fixed rent than non-irrigated plots, perhaps because production is irrigated plots 
31:733:52114:27:28:72:530:571:144:Times:144:Times:than it is on rain-fed plots. On the landlord’s side, every additional year of age increases by 0.5 
31:734:52214:28:28:72:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:percent the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract, and every additional year of education 
31:735:52312:28:27:72:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:increases it by 2 percent. This last finding could mean that better educated landlords have a 
31:736:52406:27:28:72:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:better knowledge of the law and are thus in a better position to face adverse possession claims by 
31:737:52505:28:27:72:140:460:144:Times:144:Times:their tenants.  
31:738:52520:27:28:72:75:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
31:739:52520:28:28:72:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:On the tenant’s side, a 10 percent increase in the dependency ratio, which roughly measure labor 
31:740:52617:28:27:72:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:quality within the household, implies a 3.1 percent decrease in the likelihood of observing a 
31:741:52711:27:28:72:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent contract, and for every additional $50 of income, the likelihood of observing a fixed 
31:742:52808:28:27:72:250:322:144:Times:144:Times:rent contract increases by 5 percent.  
31:743:52846:27:28:72:75:295:144:Times:144:Times: 
31:744:52846:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:This last finding offers some support for the risk sharing hypothesis as it suggests that as tenants 
31:745:52947:28:27:72:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:get wealthier, they are more likely to bear more production risk. It is important to note, however, 
31:746:53047:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:that expected utility is defined in theory over final wealth rather than on income (Bellemare and 
31:747:53145:28:27:72:531:184:144:Times:144:Times:Brown 2010), so this is merely suggestive. Perhaps more importantly, this interpretation would 
31:748:53240:27:28:72:542:157:144:Times:144:Times:implicitly assume that the preferences of the tenant exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion. The 
31:749:53340:28:28:72:491:129:144:Times:144:Times:wealth levels of the landlord and the tenant, however, are neither jointly nor separately 
31:750:53429:28:0:72:530:101:144:Times:144:Times:significant in this naïve specification, so that if one considers wealth, it is not possible to reject 
32:751:53535:0:28:72:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:that the landlord is risk-neutral or her preferences exhibit CARA and that the tenant is risk-
32:752:53629:28:27:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:neutral. If one considers income, however, the income levels of the landlord and the tenant are 
32:753:53725:27:28:72:276:654:144:Times:144:Times:barely significant at the ten percent level.  
32:754:53770:28:28:72:75:626:144:Times:144:Times: 
32:755:53770:28:27:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:More importantly, the tenurial insecurity hypothesis is supported by the data in this specification. 
32:756:53871:27:29:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:Specifically, a one-percent increase in the landlord’s subjective perception of tenurial security 
32:757:53969:29:31:72:510:542:144:Times:144:Times:(i.e., as) increases the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 1.9 percent, and this 
32:758:54065:31:27:72:280:511:144:Times:144:Times:finding is significant at the 1 percent level. 
32:759:54111:27:28:72:75:484:144:Times:144:Times: 
32:760:54111:28:28:72:535:456:144:Times:144:Times:Few things change in the specification controlling for the characteristics of the match and of the 
32:761:54210:28:27:72:536:428:144:Times:144:Times:matching process between the landlord and the tenant in column 2. At the plot level, larger plots 
32:762:54308:27:28:72:488:401:144:Times:144:Times:are less likely to be leased out under a fixed rent contract, but while this is statistically 
32:763:54402:28:27:72:541:373:144:Times:144:Times:significant, it is only marginally economically significant: for every additional 100 square meters 
32:764:54502:27:28:72:540:346:144:Times:144:Times:of plot size, the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract decreases by 0.1 percent. Moreover, 
32:765:54602:28:28:72:531:318:144:Times:144:Times:whereas the presence of irrigation on the plot entailed a 20 percent increase in the likelihood of 
32:766:54701:28:27:72:525:290:144:Times:144:Times:observing a fixed rent contract in the previous specification, this is no longer significant when 
32:767:54799:27:28:72:542:263:144:Times:144:Times:controlling for the characteristics of the match and the matching process. Likewise, the age of the 
32:768:54899:28:27:72:520:235:144:Times:144:Times:landlord is no longer significant once the match and the matching process are accounted for.  
32:769:54992:27:28:72:75:208:144:Times:144:Times: 
32:770:54992:28:28:72:534:180:144:Times:144:Times:As regards the landlord-tenant match, for every additional year the landlord and the tenant have 
32:771:55089:28:27:71:532:152:144:Times:144:Times:been contracting together, the likelihood of observing a sharecropping contract increases by 2.4 
32:772:55186:27:28:71:538:125:144:Times:144:Times:percent. Laffont and Matoussi (1995) report a similar finding, with their interpretation being that 
32:773:55286:28:0:71:533:97:144:Times:144:Times:successful repeated interactions lead to landlords trusting tenants a little bit more not to shirk in 
33:774:55391:0:28:72:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:the face of the weaker incentives provided by a sharecropping relative to fixed rent. As for the 
33:775:55488:28:27:72:528:681:144:Times:144:Times:matching process between the landlord and the tenant, for every additional potential tenant the 
33:776:55584:27:28:72:525:654:144:Times:144:Times:landlord has considered before settling on her current tenant, the likelihood that she chooses a 
33:777:55681:28:28:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:fixed rent contract decreases by 2 percent. This suggests that the more potential tenants there are, 
33:778:55782:28:27:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:the more valuable a plot is perceived to be, and so the broader the scope for adverse possession, 
33:779:55880:27:28:72:149:571:144:Times:144:Times:ceteris paribus. 
33:780:55897:28:28:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
33:781:55897:28:28:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:More importantly, the tenurial insecurity hypothesis is once again supported by the data: a 1 
33:782:55991:28:31:72:541:487:144:Times:144:Times:percent increase in as increases the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 2.2 percent, a 
33:783:56092:31:27:72:515:456:144:Times:144:Times:finding that is significant at the 1 percent level. As for the risk sharing hypothesis, it is once 
33:784:56191:27:28:72:537:429:144:Times:144:Times:again the case that for every additional $50 of tenant income, the likelihood of observing a fixed 
33:785:56290:28:28:72:534:401:144:Times:144:Times:rent contract increases by 5 percent, which again offers some partial support for the risk sharing 
33:786:56388:28:27:72:516:373:144:Times:144:Times:hypothesis. In this specification, however, one fails to reject the null hypothesis that the risk 
33:787:56486:27:28:72:509:346:144:Times:144:Times:preferences of the landlord and the tenant jointly determine contract choice both when risk 
33:788:56578:28:28:72:458:318:144:Times:144:Times:preferences are proxied for by wealth and when they are proxied for by income.

33:790:56657:27:28:72:536:263:144:Times:144:Times:Table 7 is almost identical to table 6 except that it presents estimation results for the sub-sample 
33:791:56758:28:27:72:534:235:144:Times:144:Times:of reverse tenancy, i.e., for the sub-sample of cases where the landlord is poorer than the tenant, 
33:792:56858:27:28:72:495:208:144:Times:144:Times:which is a defining feature of land tenancy in Madagascar. In the interest of brevity, the 
33:793:56949:28:28:72:523:180:144:Times:144:Times:remainder of this section focuses on the variables of interest, i.e., the change in the landlord’s 
33:794:57048:28:27:72:534:152:144:Times:144:Times:perception of tenurial security and the proxies for the risk preferences of the landlord and of the 
33:795:57148:27:28:72:107:125:144:Times:144:Times:tenant. 
33:796:57155:28:0:72:75:97:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:797:57158:0:28:72:488:709:144:Times:144:Times:Once again, the tenurial insecurity hypothesis is supported by the data at the 1 percent 
34:798:57247:28:27:72:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:significance level in the reverse tenancy sub-sample. The important difference between tables 5 
34:799:57343:27:28:72:531:654:144:Times:144:Times:and 7 is that tenurial insecurity has a stronger impact than in the reverse tenancy sample than it 
34:800:57442:28:29:72:494:626:144:Times:144:Times:does in the full sample. Whereas in the naïve specification which fails to control for the 
34:801:57533:29:30:72:519:597:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics of the landlord-tenant match and matching process, a 1 percent increase in as 
34:802:57626:30:29:72:530:567:144:Times:144:Times:increased the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 1.9 percent in the full sample, a 1 
34:803:57725:29:31:72:530:538:144:Times:144:Times:percent increase in as increases the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 2.4 percent 
34:804:57823:31:29:72:515:507:144:Times:144:Times:in the reverse tenancy sample. Likewise, whereas in the specification which controls for the 
34:805:57916:29:30:72:519:478:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics of the landlord-tenant match and matching process, a 1 percent increase in as 
34:806:58009:30:29:72:530:448:144:Times:144:Times:increased the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 2.2 percent in the full sample, a 1 
34:807:58108:29:31:72:530:419:144:Times:144:Times:percent increase in as increases the likelihood of observing a fixed rent contract by 3.9 percent 
34:808:58206:31:27:72:222:388:144:Times:144:Times:in the reverse tenancy sample.  
34:809:58238:27:28:72:75:361:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:810:58238:28:28:72:510:333:144:Times:144:Times:This strengthening of this paper’s core result when considering the reverse tenancy sample 
34:811:58329:28:27:72:542:305:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that landlords whose tenants are wealthier than they are perceive that their claim to their 
34:812:58430:27:28:72:507:278:144:Times:144:Times:own plot of land is weaker than it is for the average landlord, i.e., that landlords in reverse 
34:813:58526:28:27:72:492:250:144:Times:144:Times:tenancy agreements believe they have less bargaining power than the average landlord. 
34:814:58611:27:28:72:75:223:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:815:58611:28:28:72:535:195:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, as regards the risk sharing hypothesis in the reverse tenancy sample, it is once again the 
34:816:58711:28:27:72:512:167:144:Times:144:Times:case that for every additional $50 of tenant income, the likelihood of observing a fixed rent 
34:817:58805:27:28:72:524:140:144:Times:144:Times:contract increases significantly. The magnitude of this impact, however, is decreased slightly, 
34:818:58901:28:27:72:527:112:144:Times:144:Times:from 5 percent in table 6 to 4 percent in table 7. While this once again offers partial support in 
34:819:59000:27:0:72:523:85:144:Times:144:Times:favor of the risk sharing hypothesis, in neither specification can one reject the null hypothesis 
35:820:59101:0:28:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:that the risk preferences of the landlord and the tenant jointly determine contract choice in table 
35:821:59201:28:27:72:418:681:144:Times:144:Times:7, both when one uses wealth or income as proxies for risk preferences. 
35:822:59272:27:28:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
35:823:59272:28:29:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:The results in tables 6 and 7 thus offer strong support for the hypothesis that tenurial insecurity 
35:824:59372:29:30:72:517:597:144:Times:144:Times:drives the emergence of sharecropping in these data, especially since (i) as has the expected 
35:825:59466:30:28:72:530:567:144:Times:144:Times:effect; and (ii) one cannot reject the hypothesis that the risk preferences of the landlord and the 
35:826:59566:28:28:72:301:539:144:Times:144:Times:tenant do not jointly determine contract choice. 
35:827:59615:28:27:71:74:511:144:Times:144:Times: 
35:828:59615:27:28:71:504:484:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, following Bellemare and Brown (2010),  and allowing for the possibility that risk 
35:829:59705:28:28:71:525:456:144:Times:144:Times:preferences are defined over income rather than over final wealth, the results in tables 6 and 7 
35:830:59802:28:27:71:485:428:144:Times:144:Times:lead one to (i) fail to reject the null that the average landlord is risk-neutral or that her 
35:831:59895:27:28:71:513:401:144:Times:144:Times:preferences exhibit CARA; and (ii) reject the null that the average tenant is risk-neutral. To 
35:832:59990:28:27:71:525:373:144:Times:144:Times:conclude that this is empirical support for the canonical risk sharing hypothesis, however, one 
35:833:60086:27:28:72:502:346:144:Times:144:Times:would need to make the additional assumption that tenant preferences exhibit decreasing 
35:834:60174:28:28:72:523:318:144:Times:144:Times:absolute risk aversion (DARA). But then, there is no reason to believe that tenant preferences 
35:835:60269:28:27:72:505:290:144:Times:144:Times:exhibit DARA, especially since failure to reject the hypothesis that the average landlord’s 
35:836:60361:27:28:72:287:263:144:Times:144:Times:preferences exhibit CARA in tables 6 and 7. 
35:837:60404:28:27:72:75:235:144:Times:144:Times: 
35:838:60404:27:28:72:525:208:144:Times:144:Times:The results in tables 6 and 7 are thus especially favorable to the theoretical model of section 3 
35:839:60502:28:28:72:513:180:144:Times:144:Times:given that one rejects the null hypothesis that tenurial insecurity plays no role in explaining 
35:840:60598:28:27:72:521:152:144:Times:144:Times:contract choice while finding little support for the canonical risk sharing hypothesis. So even 
35:841:60694:27:28:72:493:125:144:Times:144:Times:though Jacoby and Minten (2007) find that land titles would have little to no impact on 
35:842:60782:28:0:72:527:97:144:Times:144:Times:agricultural investment and productivity or on the value of plots in Lac Alaotra, it appears that 
36:843:60883:0:28:72:496:709:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity does shape some aspects of economic behavior in the region. Indeed, 
36:844:60971:28:27:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:Bellemare (2010) shows that while de facto land rights – land titles – indeed have no impact on 
36:845:61067:27:28:71:539:654:144:Times:144:Times:agricultural productivity in Madagascar, landowners’ subjective perceptions of their de jure land 
36:846:61165:28:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:rights – what they can or cannot do with their plots – do affect productivity. The findings in this 
36:847:61265:28:27:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:paper thus do not contradict those of Jacoby and Minten. Indeed, their conclusion that land titles 
36:848:61364:27:28:71:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:do not increase tenurial security does not mean that there is no tenurial insecurity, the effects of 
36:849:61465:28:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:which have been shown empirically in this paper to be considerable on the land tenancy market. 
36:850:61560:28:27:71:74:515:144:Times:144:Times: 
36:851:61560:27:28:71:144:488:144:Times:144:Times:7. Conclusion 
36:852:61573:28:27:71:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:This paper has developed a theoretical explanation for the emergence of sharecropping in Lac 
36:853:61666:27:28:71:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:Alaotra, Madagascar’s most important rice-growing region. In this setting, conversations with 
36:854:61760:28:28:71:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:landowners during preliminary visits to the field have shown that some landlords perceive more 
36:855:61855:28:27:71:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:tenurial insecurity when leasing out under a fixed rent contract than when leasing out under a 
36:856:61950:27:28:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:sharecropping contract. The theoretical framework developed in this paper thus dynamicizes the 
36:857:62045:28:27:71:479:322:144:Times:144:Times:canonical principal-agent model of sharecropping (Stiglitz 1974) and augments it by 
36:858:62129:27:28:71:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:incorporating an important transaction cost, viz. the risk that the landlord will lose her plot as a 
36:859:62230:28:28:71:347:267:144:Times:144:Times:result of the contract she chooses to sign with her tenant. 
36:860:62289:28:27:71:74:239:144:Times:144:Times: 
36:861:62289:27:28:71:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:Then, using data on the landlords’ subjective perceptions of tenurial insecurity and incorporating 
36:862:62388:28:27:71:492:184:144:Times:144:Times:recent advances in applied contract theory (Bellemare and Brown 2010), this paper has 
36:863:62474:27:28:71:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:concurrently tested the hypotheses that (i) contract-dependent tenurial insecurity drives contract 
36:864:62573:28:28:71:496:129:144:Times:144:Times:choice; (ii) risk preferences drive contract choice. The data strongly support the tenurial 
36:865:62665:28:0:71:509:101:144:Times:144:Times:insecurity hypothesis developed in this paper at the expense of the risk sharing hypothesis, 
37:866:62761:0:28:72:525:709:144:Times:144:Times:showing that a 1 percent increase in the landlords’ subjective perception of tenurial insecurity 
37:867:62858:28:27:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:increases the likelihood of observing a sharecropping contract by about 2 percent. This finding is 
37:868:62957:27:28:72:507:654:144:Times:144:Times:robust to whether one considers the full sample of land tenancy or the restricted sample of 
37:869:63049:28:28:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:reverse tenancy (i.e., land tenancy contracts in which the landlord is poorer than the tenant). This 
37:870:63150:28:27:72:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:finding is also strengthened by for the characteristics of the landlord-tenant match and of the 
37:871:63246:27:28:72:489:571:144:Times:144:Times:matching process between the landlord and the tenant (Ackerberg and Botticini 2002). 
37:872:63331:28:28:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
37:873:63331:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:One shortcoming of the empirical analysis in this paper is that it is impossible to fully control for 
37:874:63433:27:28:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:the unobserved heterogeneity between landlords, tenants, and landlord-tenant matches using the 
37:875:63528:28:27:72:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:data at hand. To be fair, however, this is common to almost all empirical investigations of 
37:876:63620:27:28:72:529:433:144:Times:144:Times:contract theory. An exception to this would be Karlan and Zinman’s (2009) recent randomized 
37:877:63712:28:28:72:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:study of the credit market in South Africa, which allows them to disentangle the effects of 
37:878:63804:28:27:72:246:377:144:Times:144:Times:adverse selection and moral hazard. 
37:879:63839:27:28:72:75:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
37:880:63839:28:27:72:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:Another, perhaps more important shortcoming of the empirical analysis of this paper is that it 
37:881:63934:27:28:72:491:295:144:Times:144:Times:could not investigate the precise reason why tenurial insecurity affects contract choice. 
37:882:64024:28:28:72:504:267:144:Times:144:Times:Institutions – both formal and informal – are conducive to contract choice affecting one’s 
37:883:64115:28:27:72:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:subjective perception of tenurial insecurity in Madagascar, but it is impossible to identify the 
37:884:64212:27:28:72:530:212:144:Times:144:Times:exact mechanism through which this happens. Addressing this concern would require a careful 
37:885:64304:28:28:72:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:investigation of the way individuals form their expectations regarding tenurial insecurity.
