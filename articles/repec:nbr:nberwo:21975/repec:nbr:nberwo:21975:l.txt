2:37:2298:28:28:306:339:616:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:38:2306:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:The dramatic rise in CEO compensation during the 1990s and early 2000s is a longstanding puzzle.
2:39:2402:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:In this paper, we show that much of the rise can be explained by a tendency of firms to grant the same
2:40:2504:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:number of options each year. Number-rigidity implies that the grant-date value of option awards will
2:41:2604:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:grow with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. Further, other
2:42:2703:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:forms of CEO compensation did not adjust to offset the dramatic growth in the value of option pay.
2:43:2801:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:Number-rigidity in options can also explain the increased dispersion in pay, the difference in growth
2:44:2902:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:between the US and other countries, and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity
2:45:3004:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:returns. We present evidence that number-rigidity arose from a lack of sophistication about option
2:46:3102:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:valuation that is akin to money illusion. We show that regulatory changes requiring transparent expensing
2:47:3207:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:of the grant-date value of options led to a decline in number-rigidity and helps explain why executive
2:48:3309:14:42:72:463:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:pay increased less with equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.

3:75:4070:35:24:72:540:314:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:The dramatic rise in compensation awarded to CEOs in the United States during the 1990s and
3:76:4161:24:24:72:540:290:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:early 2000s is a longstanding puzzle. Median compensation in 2011 dollars for S&P 500 CEOs grew
3:77:4256:24:25:72:539:266:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f6:B:more than threefold from $2.9M in 1992 to $9.3M in 2001. After the mid-2000s, growth leveled off
3:78:4352:25:24:72:540:241:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:considerably, with the median CEO earning $9M in 2011 (Murphy, 2013). Compensation for US
3:79:4441:24:24:72:540:217:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs was also relatively flat in the decades leading up to the 1990s (Frydman and Saks, 2010).
3:80:4535:24:24:72:540:193:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Thus, the compensation growth during the 1990s and early 2000s was a sharp break from both
3:81:4625:24:25:72:540:169:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the trend established in preceding years and that which prevailed in subsequent years.  Adding
3:82:4719:25:24:72:539:144:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to the puzzle, the growth in CEO pay was also considerably off-trend relative to growth in other
3:83:4815:24:24:72:386:120:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:high-income occupations (Kaplan and Rauh, 2010; Kaplan, 2012).
3:84:4877:24:24:88:539:96:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:A number of explanations have been proposed for the rise in CEO pay, including weak corpo-
3:85:4967:24:0:72:540:72:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rate governance (Bebchuk and Fried, 2004; Kuhnen and Zwiebel, 2009), an increase in managers’
4:86:5061:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:marginal product due to technological advancement (Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006; Hubbard
4:87:5154:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and Palia, 1995; Cuñat and Guadalupe, 2009a,b; Dow and Raposo, 2005), greater competition for
4:88:5247:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs with general skills (Murphy and Zábojník, 2004; Frydman, 2007), and increases in firm size
4:89:5342:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:combined with a multiplicative managerial production function (Gabaix and Landier, 2008; Tervio,
4:90:5438:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2008). While all these theories are likely to be important contributors to growth in executive com-
4:91:5537:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pensation, each also has shortcomings in explaining some of the stylized facts (Frydman and Jenter,
4:92:5636:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2010), particularly the off-trend growth of CEO pay during the 1990s and early 2000s, hereafter
4:93:5731:24:24:72:210:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:referred to as the tech boom.
4:94:5760:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In this paper, we explore an alternative and complementary explanation for the surge in executive
4:95:5857:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation. It is well known that the bulk of the growth in CEO pay arrived in the form of new
4:96:5953:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:at-the-money option grants. While much of the existing research focuses on the rising grant-date
4:97:6049:24:24:72:539:442:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f5:B:valueof these options, we instead start by examining thenumberof options awarded to executives.
4:98:6144:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We show that there is a high degree of rigidity in the number of options awarded. That is, firms
4:99:6240:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:often grant executives the exact same number of options as in the previous year. In addition, other
4:100:6339:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:round multiples of the previous year’s number are common. These patterns suggest a tendency to
4:101:6433:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:think of option compensation in number rather than dollar terms. Such a tendency is also consistent
4:102:6532:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:with the fact that many firms use multi-year option plans, which pre-specify that the same number
4:103:6629:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options be granted in consecutive years (Hall, 1999; Shue and Townsend, 2014). Pre-planned or
4:104:6725:24:24:72:440:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:not, rigidity in number can have major implications for the level of CEO pay.
4:105:6802:24:25:88:539:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In particular, if a firm grants its CEO the same number of new at-the-money options as in the
4:106:6895:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:previous year, and if the firm’s stock price is X% higher than in the previous year, the grant-date
4:107:6994:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of the option award will also be X% higher than in the previous year. This fact follows directly
4:108:7096:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:from the Black–Scholes formula. Thus, in an environment like the tech boom with rapid growth in
4:109:7191:24:25:72:494:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:stock prices, number-rigidity leads to rapid growth in the grant-date value of option pay.
4:110:7281:25:24:88:539:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Our analysis builds on insights from two comprehensive review articles on executive compensa-
4:111:7374:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:tion by Murphy (1999; 2013). Murphy shows a near-perfect historical correlation between average
4:112:7469:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:executive pay and the S&P 500 index in the 1990s and early 2000s. He notes that such a pattern
5:113:7564:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:would be consistent with compensation committees focusing on the number of options granted rather
5:114:7661:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than the value of options granted. In this paper, we extend Murphy’s insights by first providing
5:115:7757:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:direct evidence that option grants over our sample period are indeed strongly rigid in number. As
5:116:7854:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:shown in Fig. 1, we find that nearly 20% of new grants contain the same number of options as
5:117:7946:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the previous year’s grant. More broadly, the number change distribution suggests that executives
5:118:8042:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and/or firms think about options in number rather than dollar terms.  Even after adjusting for
5:119:8136:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:splits, there are also pronounced spikes at round multiples of the previous year’s number, such as
5:120:8234:24:24:72:468:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:double or half. Number increases of exactly 10%, 20%, and so on are also common.
5:121:8314:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we show that number-rigidity leads to outsized growth in option pay when a firm’s stock
5:122:8407:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns are high.  Specifically, we compare pay growth for similarly performing executives with
5:123:8502:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and without number-rigid option pay. Consistent with the above discussion of the Black–Scholes
5:124:8596:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:formula, we find that the slope of the relation between changes in the grant-date value of option
5:125:8693:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:awards and a firm’s stock return is approximately one when grants are number-rigid. This relation
5:126:8790:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is significantly less steep for executives with non-number-rigid (henceforth, non-rigid) option pay.
5:127:8890:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Thus, CEOs with number-rigid grants gain more than CEOs with non-rigid grants when firm returns
5:128:8985:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:are high. Given that the tech boom was a period of extremely high stock returns, number-rigidity
5:129:9081:25:24:72:369:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:contributed to the concurrent high growth in CEO option pay.
5:130:9141:24:24:88:539:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Even if number-rigidity leads to growth in the value of options granted, it remains possible that
5:131:9238:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:other forms of compensation decrease when returns are high in order to keep total compensation
5:132:9332:24:25:72:539:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in line. However, we find no evidence of cash or other forms of compensation offsetting any of the
5:133:9430:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increase in option compensation caused by number-rigidity. If anything, other forms of compensation
5:134:9529:24:24:72:369:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:actually appear to reinforce the outsized growth in option pay.
5:135:9592:24:24:88:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:It it also important to recognize that CEOs receiving non-rigid option pay may still experience
5:136:9687:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:higher pay growth than they would have absent number-rigidity among their peers. This is because
5:137:9783:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:competition for CEO talent among firms should lead to spillovers in compensation. To investigate
5:138:9879:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:whether such spillovers operate in our context, we examine whether executives with non-rigid option
5:139:9978:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay tend to have higher compensation growth when more of their peers are number-rigid and have
6:140:10073:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:experienced recent high returns. We find that this is indeed the case, consistent with compensation
6:141:10172:25:24:72:320:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:spillovers from number-rigid to non-rigid executives.
6:142:10225:24:24:88:539:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Given the above findings that 1) number-rigidity is prevalent, 2) it leads to outsized option
6:143:10318:24:24:72:539:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay growth when returns are high, 3) other forms of compensation do not decrease to offset this
6:144:10413:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option pay growth, and 4) there are spillovers onto non-rigid executives, it seems quite plausible
6:145:10511:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that number-rigidity could account for a significant portion of overall growth in CEO pay during
6:146:10607:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the 1990s and early 2000s. To give a sense of potential magnitudes, we calibrate an equilibrium
6:147:10702:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:model of CEO pay.  Our calibrations show that, under a wide range of parameter assumptions,
6:148:10793:24:25:72:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid option compensation can explain more than half of the off-trend growth in CEO pay
6:149:10887:25:24:72:178:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:during the tech boom.
6:150:10908:24:24:88:539:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:A number-rigidity-based explanation for the rise in CEO pay also matches three other stylized
6:151:11001:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:facts. First, not only did the level of CEO pay increase during the 1990s and early 2000s, but so did
6:152:11102:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the cross-sectional dispersion of CEO pay (Frydman and Jenter, 2010). This increase in dispersion
6:153:11199:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is a natural consequence of number-rigidity, which increases the sensitivity of compensation to the
6:154:11298:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:highly idiosyncratic returns of individual firms. Second, non-US CEOs experienced significantly
6:155:11393:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:slower compensation growth during the tech boom, controlling for country-level growth and firm
6:156:11487:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:characteristics (Abowd and Bognanno, 1999; Abowd and Kaplan, 1999; Murphy, 1999; Thomas,
6:157:11575:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2009; Fernandes et al., 2013). Equity-based compensation is also less common for non-US CEOs,
6:158:11668:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:often for regulatory reasons. For example, option plans were illegal in Germany until 1996. As a
6:159:11764:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:result, non-US executives are less likely to have a number-rigid component of their pay. Finally, our
6:160:11865:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:explanation is consistent with the empirical fact that compensation became very correlated with
6:161:11960:24:24:72:258:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firm-specific stock returns in the 1990s.
6:162:12001:24:24:88:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In the remainder of the paper, we explore the question of why there is number-rigidity in option
6:163:12097:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay. In particular, we attempt to distinguish empirically between two broad classes of theories. The
6:164:12197:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:first class consists of theories in which all parties involved understand how to value options and
6:165:12295:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:choose to hold the number granted fixed because number-rigidity implements an optimal incentive
6:166:12390:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:scheme. For example, firms may grant number-rigid options to manage executive ownership or to
7:167:12484:0:25:72:280:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:award steep pay-for-performance incentives.
7:168:12527:25:24:88:539:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:The second broad class of theories includes explanations in which at least one party in the
7:169:12618:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation-setting process is somewhat unsophisticated about how to value options. Given that
7:170:12713:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options are typically granted at-the-money, it is not immediately obvious that granting the same
7:171:12809:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number of new options after a stock price increase would coincide with a pay increase.  Fully
7:172:12902:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:understanding this notion requires knowledge of option pricing formulas that economists only derived
7:173:13002:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:relatively recently (Black and Scholes, 1973). There is ample anecdotal evidence that when option
7:174:13099:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation first came into widespread use, many did not understand or trust these formulas.
7:175:13192:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Instead, number may have been used as a proxy for value. This heuristic is similar to thinking
7:176:13286:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:about money in nominal rather than real terms, i.e., money illusion (Kahneman et al., 1986; Shafir
7:177:13384:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:et al., 1997). Further, prior to 2006, government regulations concerning the reporting of options
7:178:13481:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:focused on number rather than value. These regulations likely reflect, but also may have influenced,
7:179:13581:24:25:72:359:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the way that option compensation was commonly measured.
7:180:13636:25:24:88:539:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:We find a number of results pointing toward the second class of theories. We begin by testing
7:181:13729:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:whether firms become less likely to grant number-rigid options when they are required to disclose
7:182:13826:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or expense the grant-date dollar value of those options on their proxy and income statements,
7:183:13919:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:respectively. If number-rigidity implements an optimal contract, the contract should remain optimal
7:184:14018:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:regardless of the way option compensation is reported to shareholders. However, if number-rigidity
7:185:14116:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:arises from naïveté on someone’s part, changes in reporting requirements may reduce that naïveté.
7:186:14213:24:25:88:539:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To examine these issues, we exploit two separate reforms by FASB and the SEC that went into
7:187:14304:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:effect in 2006. The FASB reform required firms to expense on their income statements the total
7:188:14398:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to employees. The SEC reform required firms to
7:189:14492:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:disclose the Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to each top executives on their proxy
7:190:14590:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:statements. We find that, following these two reforms, the prevalence of option number-rigidity
7:191:14685:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(conditional on granting options) declines significantly. To control for concurrent time trends, we
7:192:14784:24:24:72:539:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:use a differences-in-differences framework with stock compensation as a control group. Stock com-
7:193:14881:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pensation also has a number and value associated with it, but its value had to be expensed and
8:194:14976:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:disclosed throughout our sample period. We find no change in number-rigidity for stock compensa-
8:195:15072:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:tion and a large decline in number-rigidity for option compensation. Moreover, we find that prior
8:196:15169:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to the reforms, the prevalence of number-rigidity was much higher for option compensation than
8:197:15263:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:stock compensation. The latter finding is consistent with the idea that converting number to value
8:198:15361:24:25:72:471:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is harder for options than for stock, leading to greater money-illusion type thinking.
8:199:15447:25:24:88:539:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:The above analysis of regulatory changes suggests that some combination of expensing and
8:200:15535:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:disclosure reduces number-rigidity in option pay. An important remaining question is whether it is
8:201:15633:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:primarily expensing or disclosure that is responsible for the reduction. Given that the FASB and
8:202:15729:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:SEC reforms so closely coincided, it is difficult to distinguish the two empirically. We instead exploit
8:203:15833:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the fact that, prior to the reforms, some firms voluntarily chose to expense and/or disclose. Using
8:204:15932:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:hand collected data from 10-K filings, we find that firms that voluntarily expensed the Black–Scholes
8:205:16033:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of their option compensation were significantly less likely to use number-rigid option awards
8:206:16132:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(both within and between firms). In contrast, firms that voluntarily disclosed the Black–Scholes
8:207:16228:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of their option compensation were no less likely to use number-rigid option awards. These
8:208:16323:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:findings suggest that subtracting the total value of option compensation from reported earnings (i.e.,
8:209:16425:24:25:72:539:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:expensing) has a greater effect on how the cost of option awards is viewed than merely reporting
8:210:16521:25:24:72:431:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the value of option awards paid to high-ranking executives (i.e., disclosure).
8:211:16599:24:24:88:539:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In addition, it is plausible that firms with more independent or sophisticated boards are more
8:212:16693:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:likely to choose optimal compensation structures or to be aware of option valuation methods. We
8:213:16788:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:find that boards with a greater percentage of independent directors, directors that joined before the
8:214:16889:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:current CEO, or directors with an MBA degree are significantly less likely to grant number-rigid
8:215:16985:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options. These findings cut against the first class of theories, in which number-rigidity arises from
8:216:17086:24:24:72:168:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:optimal contracting.
8:217:17106:24:25:88:539:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Given that transparent reporting requirements and board independence/sophistication reduce
8:218:17196:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity, one may wonder whether sophisticated CEOs consciously use number-rigidity to
8:219:17289:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:conceal high compensation growth from less sophisticated boards or shareholders. Here, we find
8:220:17383:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:mixed evidence. On the one hand, we find that the probability of receiving number-rigid grants
9:221:17478:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is asymmetric with respect to firm returns. The probability of a CEO receiving number-rigid pay
9:222:17573:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:following extreme positive returns (when they benefit the most from rigidity) is considerably higher
9:223:17673:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than the probability following extreme negative returns (when they suffer the most from rigidity).
9:224:17771:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:This asymmetry suggests that at least some CEOs recognize that the value of the same number of
9:225:17865:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:new options varies with their firm’s stock price. However, we also find results suggesting that some
9:226:17965:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs think about option compensation in units of number, or at least endure large losses in value
9:227:18062:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:due to number-rigidity. In particular, we find that following a positive stock split, many CEOs
9:228:18157:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:continue to receive the same, non-split-adjusted number of options as in the previous year. Rigidity
9:229:18257:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of this type represents a large decline in CEO pay. In contrast, following a split, very few executives
9:230:18360:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:receive the same, non-split-adjusted number of shares of stock as they did in the previous year. This
9:231:18461:24:24:72:501:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is again likely because it is much easier to convert number to value for stock than options.
9:232:18553:24:24:88:539:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Overall, we show that number-rigidity helps explain many of the striking stylized facts relating
9:233:18649:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to CEO pay during the tech boom period.  Our analysis also offers a potential explanation for
9:234:18742:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:why CEO pay growth tapered considerably after the tech boom, despite high stock market returns
9:235:18836:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:during the housing boom of the mid-2000s. We show that firms shifted their focus from number to
9:236:18931:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value during this period, partly due to regulatory changes requiring the expensing of the grant-date
9:237:19031:25:48:72:181:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of option awards.

9:239:19095:38:32:72:277:234:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:2.1.Growth in Executive Compensation
9:240:19131:32:24:72:540:202:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Before exploring the effects of rigidity on compensation growth, we first review recent trends in
9:241:19228:24:24:72:540:178:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:executive compensation. Fig. 2 shows how CEO compensation evolved from 1992 to 2010, estimated
9:242:19322:24:24:72:540:154:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:following the method used by Murphy (2013). We restrict the sample to CEOs of firms that were
9:243:19415:24:25:72:540:130:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:ever a part of the S&P 500 during the sample period. There are 947 such firms. The level of each
9:244:19511:25:24:72:540:105:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:bar represents the median level of total compensation in each year in 2011 dollars. Each bar is
9:245:19606:24:0:72:540:81:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:decomposed based upon the mean proportion of each component of compensation in each year. As
10:246:19699:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:has been previously documented, total compensation more than tripled from 1992 to 2001, before
10:247:19793:25:24:72:539:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:subsequently leveling off. As can also be seen, the vast majority of this growth was in the form of
10:248:19892:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option compensation, which came to represent the largest component of CEO pay. Most of the other
10:249:19988:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:components remained relatively flat during this time period. In later years, option compensation
10:250:20084:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:appears to have been partly replaced by stock compensation. The decline in option compensation
10:251:20178:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:most likely occurred because firms were required to begin expensing the grant-date fair value of
10:252:20274:24:24:72:474:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options in the mid-2000s, which reduced the accounting advantages of option grants.
10:253:20357:24:24:88:539:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Note that compensation in Fig. 2 is reported in terms of grant-date value instead of realized
10:254:20450:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value at exercise.  Therefore, the growth in compensation cannot be attributed to the fact that
10:255:20545:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:previously granted options and restricted stock are worth more at exercise following strong equity
10:256:20643:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns. Instead, the figure shows that the grant-date value of new option awards each year grew
10:257:20739:24:24:72:273:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.
10:258:20781:24:25:88:539:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Fig. 3 shows the time series of median option compensation, non-option compensation, and total
10:259:20875:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation for the same sample as Fig. 2. Income for the top 1% and 0.1% of US earners from
10:260:20968:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Piketty and Saez (2003) are also shown for comparison. All values are adjusted for inflation and
10:261:21064:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:normalized to equal one in 1992. This figure shows that CEO option compensation grew much faster
10:262:21160:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than other forms of CEO pay from 1992 to 2001. Option compensation grew more than sixfold over
10:263:21254:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:this period, while non-option compensation remained relatively flat, growing at a rate similar to
10:264:21351:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:income for the top 1% and 0.1% of earners. Thus, most of the growth in total CEO compensation
10:265:21444:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in excess of other high earners during this period came in the form of options. Also consistent with
10:266:21544:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Fig. 2, total compensation leveled offconsiderably after 2001, while option compensation decreased,
10:267:21643:24:24:72:263:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and non-option compensation increased.
10:268:21681:24:24:88:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, growth rates of CEO and top executive compensation in the US greatly outpaced growth
10:269:21774:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rates in other countries during the tech boom. This abnormal growth remains after controlling for
10:270:21871:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:country-level economic growth and firm characteristics (Abowd and Bognanno, 1999; Abowd and
10:271:21962:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Kaplan, 1999; Murphy, 1999; Thomas, 2009; Fernandes et al., 2013). In addition, Frydman and
10:272:22053:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Jenter (2010) note that the cross-sectional dispersion in CEO pay rose dramatically during the tech
11:273:22153:0:40:72:493:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:boom, a finding that we corroborate using our data in Fig. A1 in the Online Appendix .

11:275:22284:31:25:72:540:638:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:In this paper, we show that rigidity in the number of options granted, combined with rapidly
11:276:22376:25:24:72:539:613:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increasing equity prices and lack of offsetting changes in other forms of compensation, can help
11:277:22472:24:24:72:540:589:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:explain the patterns just described.  We acknowledge that this is somewhat of a partial theory
11:278:22566:24:24:72:540:565:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in that it does not explain why option compensation came into use in the first place.  Murphy
11:279:22659:24:25:72:540:541:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(2013) argues that the sudden rise in the use of options as a form of compensation for executives
11:280:22756:25:24:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in the 1990s was driven by a “perfect storm” of increased shareholder pressure for equity-based pay
11:281:22855:24:24:72:401:492:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:combined with various regulatory changes that happened to coincide.
11:282:22922:24:24:88:539:468:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:For example, in 1991, the SEC changed its holding period rules so that stock acquired from
11:283:23012:24:25:72:540:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:exercising options could be sold immediately, as long as the exercise date was more than six months
11:284:23111:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:after the grant date. Prior to the rule change, executives had to hold stock acquired from exercising
11:285:23212:24:24:72:540:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options for at least six months.  This requirement meant that executives exercising options had
11:286:23307:24:24:72:540:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to deal with cash-flow issues (from paying the exercise price) and risk (from the possibility that
11:287:23405:24:25:72:540:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the stock price might decline between the time the options were exercised and the shares obtained
11:288:23502:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:were sold). In 1992, the SEC set pay disclosure rules such that only the number of options paid
11:289:23597:24:24:72:540:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to executives needed to be disclosed and not the value of those options. In 1993, the Clinton $1M
11:290:23694:24:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:deductibility cap was passed. This cap made compensation in excess of $1M non-deductible for
11:291:23786:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:tax purposes. However, the cap did not apply to performance-based pay, including at-the-money
11:292:23879:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options. In addition, prior to 2006, options did not need to be recognized as an expense on a firm’s
11:293:23979:24:24:72:429:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:income statement, making them attractive from an accounting perspective.
11:294:24051:24:24:88:539:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Again, we do not attempt to explain why firms began using options. The above factors all likely
11:295:24146:24:25:72:540:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:contributed. Our goal is to show that, conditional on using option compensation, a focus on the
11:296:24241:25:0:72:478:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number of options awarded led to high growth in the grant-date value of new awards.
12:297:24325:0:32:72:214:703:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:2.3.Existing Explanations
12:298:24350:32:24:72:540:671:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:A number of theories have been proposed for the growth in US CEO compensation in recent decades.
12:299:24446:24:24:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:One view is that CEOs were able to raise their own pay due to weak corporate governance (Bebchuk
12:300:24542:24:25:72:540:623:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and Fried, 2004; Kuhnen and Zwiebel, 2009).  However, there is little evidence that corporate
12:301:24635:25:24:72:540:598:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:governance has become weaker over time or in the 1990s in particular. If anything, it appears that
12:302:24733:24:24:72:540:574:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:governance has been on an upward trend (Holmstrom and Kaplan, 2001; Hermalin, 2005; Kaplan,
12:303:24824:24:24:72:539:550:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2008). More in the spirit of this paper, it has also been argued that options may have been difficult
12:304:24925:24:25:72:540:526:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:for boards or shareholders to understand (Hall and Murphy, 2003; Jensen et al., 2004), and thus
12:305:25020:25:24:72:540:501:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:were an easier form of compensation for executives to “skim.” In later analysis, we show that lack of
12:306:25121:24:24:72:540:477:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:sophistication with respect to option valuation may have contributed to number-rigidity and that
12:307:25217:24:24:72:526:453:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms with more independent or sophisticated boards were less likely to grant number-rigid pay.
12:308:25312:24:25:88:539:429:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:A second view is that the growth in CEO pay is primarily due to increases in firm size. According
12:309:25409:25:24:72:540:404:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to this view, managerial talent has a multiplicative effect on firm output, so matching with a slightly
12:310:25512:24:24:72:540:380:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:more talented manager can lead to large increases in firm value (Gabaix and Landier, 2008; Tervio,
12:311:25610:24:24:72:540:356:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2008). Gabaix and Landier show that, under certain conditions, CEO pay should move one-for-one
12:312:25704:24:25:72:540:332:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:with changes in the size of the typical firm. Thus, the sixfold increase in CEO pay between 1980
12:313:25800:25:24:72:540:307:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and 2003 can be explained by the sixfold increase in average market capitalization over that period.
12:314:25900:24:24:72:540:283:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:However, Frydman and Saks (2010) show that there is virtually no correlation between firm size
12:315:25994:24:24:72:540:259:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and CEO pay prior to 1970. In a similar vein, Nagel (2010) shows that the relation following 1970
12:316:26091:24:25:72:540:235:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is sensitive to sample-selection. More generally, we believe Gabaix and Landier’s model highlights
12:317:26189:25:24:72:540:210:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:a very important channel for the growth in executive compensation. However, for the growth in
12:318:26282:24:24:72:540:186:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firm size to explainallof the rise in CEO compensation in recent decades, one must make strong
12:319:26376:24:24:72:539:162:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:parameter assumptions. We show that number-rigidity can help explain the off-trend growth in
12:320:26468:24:25:72:511:138:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEO compensation during the tech boom while allowing for more conservative assumptions.
12:321:26555:25:24:88:539:113:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:A third view is that CEO compensation has risen due to changes in the nature of the job.
12:322:26643:24:0:72:540:89:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:For example, managers’ marginal product may have increased due to improved communications
13:323:26734:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:technology (Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006), increased competition (Hubbard and Palia, 1995;
13:324:26829:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Cuñat and Guadalupe, 2009a,b), or higher volatility of the business environment (Dow and Raposo,
13:325:26925:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2005; Campbell et al., 2001). Hermalin (2005) suggests that CEOs must be compensated for the
13:326:27017:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increased risk of being fired due to improved corporate governance. Frydman (2007) and Murphy
13:327:27110:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and Zabojnik (2010) show that CEO jobs have increasingly placed a greater emphasis on general
13:328:27203:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rather than firm-specific skills; this shift may have allowed managers to capture a greater portion
13:329:27302:24:24:72:129:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of the rents.
13:330:27315:24:24:88:539:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:While all these theories are likely to be important contributors to the growth in executive
13:331:27406:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation over the past several decades, they also do not fully capture the unique trends during
13:332:27505:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the tech boom (Frydman and Jenter, 2010).  None of these theories are tied directly to option
13:333:27598:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation, and they do not account for the increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of CEO
13:334:27693:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay. In addition, the effect of the various factors suggested may not be large or rapid enough to
13:335:27790:24:25:72:495:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:explain the dramatic off-trend growth in compensation during the 1990s and early 2000s.
13:336:27877:25:24:88:539:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Related to this paper, Murphy (2002) argues that misperceptions regarding the cost of option
13:337:27969:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation may have contributed to compensation growth. He argues that many boards and
13:338:28057:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:practitioners viewed the cost of granting options as far below the true economic cost because options
13:339:28158:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:could be granted with no cash outlay, without incurring an accounting charge, and upon exercise led
13:340:28257:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to no change in accounting income as well as a reduction in taxable income. The number-rigidity
13:341:28352:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:phenomenon highlighted in this paper may be symptomatic of a related form of misperceived costs
13:342:28447:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in which number is taken as a proxy for value. Consistent with the idea that firms misperceive costs
13:343:28547:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:if they are not accompanied by changes to recognized accounting income, we show in Section 5.2 that
13:344:28646:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms were less likely to focus on the number of options granted if they expensed the Black–Scholes
13:345:28745:24:0:72:268:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of options when reporting earnings.

14:348:28805:32:24:72:540:627:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We use executive compensation data from Execucomp, which covers firms in the S&P 1500. Our
14:349:28895:24:24:72:540:603:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:sample period runs from 1992 to 2010. The data are derived from firms’ annual proxy statements
14:350:28989:24:24:72:540:579:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and contain information regarding the compensation paid to the top executives in a firm (usually
14:351:29085:24:25:72:540:555:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:five per firm) in various forms (e.g., salary, bonus, stock, options, etc.) during the fiscal year. For
14:352:29188:25:24:72:540:530:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options, Execucomp contains detailed grant-level data on the date, number, and value of each option
14:353:29287:24:24:72:540:506:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant. In 20% of cases, executives receive more than one option grant during a fiscal year. Often,
14:354:29385:24:24:72:540:482:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:one grant is specific to the executive, while another is part of a long-term incentive plan that is
14:355:29484:24:25:72:540:458:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:common among all executives in the firm. In these cases, we focus on the largest option grant (as
14:356:29581:25:24:72:540:433:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:measured by the number of options) within each fiscal year, to better identify number-rigid grants.
14:357:29680:24:24:88:539:409:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:For observations after 2006, we use the exact date of the option grant to precisely measure firm
14:358:29776:24:24:72:540:385:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns between consecutive grants. Prior to 2006, firms were only required to report the expiration
14:359:29876:24:25:72:540:361:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:date of the option grant. Following the literature (e.g., Aboody and Kasznik, 2000; Lie, 2005), we
14:360:29974:25:24:72:540:336:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:infer the grant date from the expiration date under the assumption that expiration dates occur on
14:361:30071:24:24:72:540:312:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant date annual anniversaries. However, we note that this may introduce error into our estimates
14:362:30169:24:24:72:540:288:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of firm returns between consecutive grants as some firms set expiration dates to the end of quarters
14:363:30269:24:25:72:540:264:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or years.  In order to properly split-adjust the grant-level data, we assume that, following SEC
14:364:30365:25:24:72:540:239:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:requirements, firms do not report the number of options originally in a grant, but the number of
14:365:30461:24:24:72:540:215:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options in a grant as of the proxy date (SRCDATE in Execucomp).  Thus, if an executive was
14:366:30551:24:24:72:540:191:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:granted 100 options, but there was a 2-for-1 stock split prior to the proxy date, the firm would
14:367:30647:24:25:72:540:167:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:report that the executive was granted 200 options on its proxy statement.  We verify that our
14:368:30740:25:24:72:540:142:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:results are not driven by reporting errors around splits, as discussed in Section C in the Online
14:369:30837:24:24:72:540:118:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Appendix . Finally, firms were required to begin reporting the fair value of option compensation
14:370:30933:24:0:72:540:94:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in 2006. Following the literature, we use the Black–Scholes value computed by Execucomp prior to
15:371:31031:0:25:72:97:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2006.
15:372:31036:25:24:88:539:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Execucomp offers grant-level option award data throughout our sample period.  However, it
15:373:31125:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:only has grant-level stock award data after 2006. Therefore, we instead use grant-level stock award
15:374:31224:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:data from the Form 4 filings that the SEC requires of CEOs and other insiders. These filings must
15:375:31321:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:report details of changes in ownership—including from stock grants. Thomson-Reuters collects this
15:376:31418:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:information in their TNF Insider Filings dataset.1We merge these data based on CEO names, hand

15:382:31904:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:analysis, unless otherwise noted, we restrict the sample to CEOs of S&P 500 firms. Because firms
15:383:32000:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:may enter and exit the S&P 500 during our sample period, we include all 947 firms that were ever
15:384:32096:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:part of the S&P 500 during the sample period. This assures that the trends we document do not
15:385:32189:24:24:72:332:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:merely reflect changes in the composition of the index.
15:386:32244:24:25:88:539:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Our baseline analysis focuses on S&P 500 CEOs because they experienced the most dramatic
15:387:32332:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and publicly scrutinized increases in pay. However, other top executives also experienced strong
15:388:32428:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay growth during our sample period. In supplementary results shown in Fig. A2 in the Online
15:389:32520:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Appendix, we also find strong number-rigidity in extended samples using all top executives in a firm
15:390:32620:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and/or all firms in the S&P 1500. This suggests that number-rigidity can account for increases in
15:391:32717:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:executive compensation more broadly. To increase estimation power, we use these extended samples
15:392:32813:24:102:72:166:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in some regressions.

16:397:33115:32:24:72:540:671:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We categorize option grants each year as number-rigid if the split-adjusted number of options in the
16:398:33215:24:24:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant is the same as in the previous year. More broadly, we categorize grants as number-reference
16:399:33312:24:25:72:540:623:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(inclusive of number-rigid) if the ratio of the number of options granted in the current year relative
16:400:33414:25:24:72:539:598:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to the previous year equals1±a multiple of 1/2, 1/4, ... , 1/10. Number-reference grants may award
16:401:33512:24:24:72:540:574:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:exactly double or half the number of options awarded in the previous year, or they may award other
16:402:33610:24:24:72:540:550:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:exact fractional increases/decreases. These number-reference grants could reflect a focus on number
16:403:33709:24:25:72:540:526:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in the compensation-setting process, however, in some cases they may be an artifact of rounding
16:404:33804:25:24:72:540:501:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to the nearest round lot in number.  Observations in which the executive received zero options
16:405:33898:24:24:72:540:477:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in either the current or previous year are never categorized as number-rigid or number-reference
16:406:33994:24:24:72:540:453:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(e.g., receiving zero options in two consecutive years is not considered number-rigid). We also only
16:407:34094:24:25:72:540:429:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compare the number of options in consecutive years (e.g., a CEO who receives 100,000 options in
16:408:34189:25:24:72:540:404:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1996, none in 1997, and 100,000 in 1998 would not be considered number-rigid in either 1997 or
16:409:34283:24:24:72:101:380:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1998).
16:410:34289:24:24:88:539:356:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In later parts of this paper, we also refer to “number-rigid firms.” By number-rigid firms, we
16:411:34383:24:25:72:540:332:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:mean firms that granted number-rigid options to their CEO in the current year. A firm does not
16:412:34477:25:24:72:540:307:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:necessarily grant the same number of options to its CEO for the full length of his or her tenure.
16:413:34574:24:24:72:540:283:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:However, we find that when a formerly number-rigid firm does adjust the number of options granted,
16:414:34672:24:24:72:540:259:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the CEO usually receives an increase in option compensation (both in terms of number and value),
16:415:34768:24:40:72:297:235:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:as shown in Table A2 in the Online Appendix .

16:417:34835:31:24:72:539:164:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Next, we explore the extent to which firms with number-rigid CEO option compensation differ from
16:418:34931:24:25:72:540:140:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:other firms in terms of their observable characteristics. Because there are likely to be time trends
16:419:35031:25:24:72:540:115:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in these variables and the prevalence of number-rigidity has changed over time, we examine three
16:420:35127:24:0:72:540:91:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:cross-sections of the data from 1995, 2000, and 2005 rather than pool all years together. Table 1
17:421:35226:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compares firm characteristics for number-rigid, number-reference, and other option paying firms.
17:422:35322:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Number-rigid and number-reference firms appear to be fairly similar to other option payers in terms
17:423:35421:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of size, market to book, investment, leverage, and profitability. We also find that number-rigidity
17:424:35520:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:occurs across many industries and that the overall industry distribution is fairly similar for the three
17:425:35624:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:types of firms (see the Online Appendix for details). However, our analysis does not assume that
17:426:35720:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms choose to grant number-rigid compensation randomly. Indeed, firms that do so may choose
17:427:35813:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to report information in a less transparent manner or have worse proxies for governance, as shown
17:428:35910:24:49:72:169:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in our later analysis.

17:431:35979:31:25:72:540:421:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We begin by exploring the extent of rigidity in various units of executive option and stock grants
17:432:36077:25:24:72:540:396:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:over our sample period. By rigidity, we refer specifically to cases in which the compensation growth
17:433:36177:24:24:72:540:372:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:distribution appears lumpy, with extra mass at zero (no change relative to the previous year). First,
17:434:36278:24:24:72:540:348:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:we compute the percent change in the (split-adjusted) number of options granted to a CEO in the
17:435:36373:24:25:72:540:324:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:current year relative to the previous year. Panel A of Fig. 1 shows a histogram representing the
17:436:36469:25:24:72:540:299:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:distribution of growth in the number of options awarded to a CEO. The sample consists of CEOs
17:437:36562:24:24:72:540:275:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that received options in the current and previous year. The most striking feature of this figure is
17:438:36661:24:24:72:540:251:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the large spike at zero. By far, the modal outcome is for a CEO to be paid the exact same number
17:439:36757:24:25:72:540:227:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options in the current year as in the previous year.  This is the case for nearly 20% of CEO
17:440:36852:25:24:72:540:202:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option grants. Interestingly, there are also spikes at round changes such as -50% and 100%, even
17:441:36948:24:24:72:540:178:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:after adjusting for splits. In addition, we find that many other changes occur in round units—for
17:442:37045:24:24:72:540:154:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:example, an exact 10% increase in the number of options awarded relative to the previous year.
17:443:37139:24:25:72:540:130:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:These patterns would seem to suggest that someone in the compensation-setting process thinks of
17:444:37234:25:24:72:309:105:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option grants in number rather than dollar terms.
17:445:37283:24:0:88:539:81:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:We focus on number-rigid grants in this paper because they represent a common and easily
18:446:37373:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:identifiable compensation policy in the data. However, some firms may also have focused on number
18:447:37470:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in other ways. For example, they may have rewarded CEOs for high firm returns with (potentially
18:448:37565:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:non-round) increases in the number of options.  It is difficult to necessarily categorize number
18:449:37661:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increases coupled with high returns as representing number-focus, but such behavior would only
18:450:37755:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increase compensation growth. For reasons that will become clear in the next section, a number
18:451:37849:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increase following high returns would lead to a particularly large increase in the value of option
18:452:37947:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay. In Fig. A3 in the Online Appendix we show that, conditional on returns over 25%, there were
18:453:38043:24:24:72:509:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:indeed many firms during the tech boom that still increased the number of options granted.
18:454:38133:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To further explore the extent to which option grants reflect a focus on number or value, we also
18:455:38229:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:examine the distribution of growth in the grant-date Black–Scholes value of options awarded to a
18:456:38325:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEO. Panel A of Fig. 4 shows this distribution. We find weaker evidence of rigidity in terms of
18:457:38420:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Black-Scholes value: less than 6% of CEOs receive the same value of options as in the previous
18:458:38514:24:25:72:98:418:119:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:B:year.2
18:459:38520:25:24:88:539:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Next, we examine stock compensation. In Fig. 4, we plot the growth distribution for the number
18:460:38614:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and value for shares awarded to a CEO. The value of a stock grant may be easier to conceptualize
18:461:38710:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than the value of an option grant. Therefore, one might expect executives and boards to be more
18:462:38805:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:likely to think about stock compensation in dollar terms, leading to less number-rigidity. This is
18:463:38903:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:exactly what we find. Stock grants are somewhat rigid in number, but to a significantly lesser extent
18:464:39004:24:40:72:135:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than options.
18:465:39017:40:31:72:342:232:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:4.2.Option Number-Rigidity and Option Pay Growth
18:466:39065:31:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Next, we explore the implications of number-rigidity for option pay growth when stock returns are
18:467:39162:24:36:72:540:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:high. As mentioned earlier, if a firm grants its CEO the same number of new at-the-money options
18:468:39258:36:15:87:539:141:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:2We also find evidence that other firms focused on value by granting constant value as a multiple of salary
18:469:39365:15:11:72:540:126:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:or constant face value (defined as the grant date price of the underlying multiplied by the number of options) in
18:470:39478:11:11:72:540:115:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:consecutive years, with large value increases awarded every several years. We argue that all firms, even if they were
18:471:39595:11:11:72:539:104:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:value-focused, experienced competitive spillover effects from number-focused firms in terms of growth in compensation
18:472:39712:11:11:72:540:93:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:during the tech boom. In addition, prior to 2006, firms were not required to disclose the Black–Scholes value of options
18:473:39832:11:10:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:paid to top executives. Therefore, we use the Black–Scholes value computed by Execucomp for the earlier years of the
18:474:39948:10:0:72:533:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:sample. We do not find major differences in value-rigidity when value is self-reported or computed by Execucomp.
19:475:40062:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:as in the previous year, and the firm’s stock price is X% higher than in the previous year, the
19:476:40157:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant-date value of the option award will also be X% higher than in the previous year. This follows
19:477:40256:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:directly from the Black–Scholes formula. In particular, for an at-the-money option with astrike
19:478:40351:24:44:72:507:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:priceXthat is equal to the grant-date stock priceS, the Black–Scholes formula reduces to:
19:479:40440:44:44:213:398:592:119:g_d0_f14:119:g_d0_f14:C:S⇤[e-dTN(Z)-e-rTN(Z--T(1/2))],
19:480:40470:44:24:88:540:548:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:whereZ=[T(r-d+-2)]/-T(1/2). From the formula, it is clear that doublingSwill double the
19:481:40557:24:24:72:540:524:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:value of the option. To gain further intuition, consider what occurs in a reverse stock split, where
19:482:40657:24:25:72:540:500:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:two shares become one share and the stock price doubles. In this case, two options also become
19:483:40751:25:24:72:540:475:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:one. Thus, two at-the-money options on the old stock must be worth the same as one at-the-money
19:484:40846:24:24:72:540:451:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option on the new stock. In other words, when the stock price doubles in the split, the value of an
19:485:40945:24:24:72:269:427:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:at-the-money option must double as well.
19:486:40985:24:25:88:539:403:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In light of the discussion above, we compare the relation between option compensation growth
19:487:41077:25:24:72:540:378:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and firm returns for the number-rigid and non-rigid samples. For this exercise, we exclude number-
19:488:41175:24:24:72:540:354:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:reference grants from the non-rigid sample. This is done because it is unclear whether number-
19:489:41269:24:24:72:540:330:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:reference grants reflect a focus on number, and we want to form a counterfactual based on grants
19:490:41365:24:25:72:540:306:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that are less likely to be number-focused.3Fig. 5 plots changes in the log Black–Scholes value of
19:491:41462:25:24:72:540:281:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options granted against the log firm return between two consecutive grants. The sample consists
19:492:41557:24:24:72:540:257:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of CEOs that received options in the current and previous year. We fit a local linear regression
19:493:41653:24:24:72:540:233:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:using the Epanichnikov kernel with the rule-of-thumb bandwidth. Absent any changes in volatility
19:494:41749:24:25:72:540:209:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or other parameters in the Black–Scholes formula, we expect the relation within the number-rigid
19:495:41845:25:24:72:540:184:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:sample to fall along the 45 degree line. Because these parameters do not change substantially year
19:496:41943:24:24:72:540:160:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to year within our sample, we indeed find that the empirical relation falls very close to the 45 degree
19:497:42046:24:39:72:540:136:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:line. However, for non-rigid grants, we find that the relation between option value growth and firm
19:498:42145:39:15:87:539:97:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:3Nonetheless, our results change little if number-reference grants are included in the non-rigid sample. Likewise,
19:499:42259:15:10:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:we find similar results if we exclude firms that granted number-rigid options in the previous year (but not in current
19:500:42377:10:0:72:203:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:year) from the non-rigid sample.
20:501:42411:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns is substantially flatter. The two curves cross just to the right of zero. Thus, CEOs with
20:502:42508:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid grants gain more than others when firm returns are positive. Consequently, during
20:503:42602:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:boom periods when firm returns are high on average, CEOs with number-rigid grants experience
20:504:42694:24:40:72:376:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:higher option pay growth than others with similar performance.
20:505:42756:40:31:72:343:596:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:4.3.Lack of Offsets in Other Forms of Compensation
20:506:42806:31:24:72:539:565:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Next, we explore the extent to which changes in cash and other non-option compensation offset
20:507:42899:24:25:72:540:541:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:changes in the value of option grants for number-rigid CEOs. In times when option pay growth for
20:508:42995:25:24:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid CEOs is very high due to high firm returns, boards could presumably counteract the
20:509:43090:24:24:72:540:492:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:change in option pay by adjusting cash compensation in the opposite direction. This would allow
20:510:43185:24:24:72:540:468:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms to follow a number-rigid policy while simultaneously moderating changes in total pay when
20:511:43280:24:25:72:540:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns are extreme. However, Fig. 2 suggests that there was not a broad reduction in other forms
20:512:43377:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of pay as options exploded during the tech boom. Indeed, for many firms, there are not enough
20:513:43470:24:24:72:497:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:dollars in these other forms of pay to offset the large increase in grant-date option values.
20:514:43563:24:24:88:539:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To more formally examine the question of whether other forms of compensation decline to
20:515:43650:24:25:72:539:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:offset increases in option pay induced by number-rigidity, we reproduce Fig.  5 with the y-axis
20:516:43745:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:now representing cash compensation (salary plus bonus). The results are shown in Panel A of Fig.
20:517:43841:24:24:72:539:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:6. If cash compensation offsets rigidity-driven changes in option pay, we would expect to find a
20:518:43937:24:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:negatively sloped line. As can be seen, cash compensation does not decline for number-rigid CEOs
20:519:44033:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:as firm returns become increasingly positive; rather, it increases.  Moreover, cash compensation
20:520:44129:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increases similarly with firm returns for number-rigid CEOs and non-rigid CEOs.  If anything,
20:521:44222:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the slope is slightly steeper for number-rigid CEOs. In Panel B, we also examine all non-option
20:522:44317:24:24:72:540:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation, including the grant-date value of stock awards.  Again we find no evidence that
20:523:44410:24:25:72:463:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:non-option compensation decreases for number-rigid CEOs when returns are high.
20:524:44488:25:24:88:539:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Of course, risk-averse CEOs may value an additional dollar of risky option compensation less
20:525:44580:24:24:72:540:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than a dollar of certain cash compensation. Thus, we would not necessarily expect cash or other
20:526:44675:24:0:72:540:80:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:non-option compensation to decline one-for-one with rigidity-induced increases in option pay. How-
21:527:44775:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:ever, our findings suggest that non-option compensation does not decline at all.  If anything, it
21:528:44872:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:appears that non-option compensation reinforces rather than offsets increases in option pay driven
21:529:44970:24:39:72:163:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:by number-rigidity.

21:531:45003:32:24:72:540:589:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:It it also important to recognize that CEOs whose option compensation is not number-rigid may
21:532:45096:24:24:72:540:565:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:still experience higher pay growth than they would have absent number-rigidity among their peers.
21:533:45193:24:25:72:540:541:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:This is because competition for CEO talent among firms should lead to spillovers in compensation.
21:534:45290:25:24:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Before presenting direct tests of spillovers, we first present three pieces of motivating evidence that
21:535:45393:24:24:72:540:492:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:spillovers between number-rigid and non-rigid firms are likely to occur.  For brevity, we reserve
21:536:45490:24:24:72:492:468:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:detailed analysis for Table A2 in the Online Appendix and summarize the results below.
21:537:45576:24:25:88:539:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:First, we find that firms that awarded number-rigid options to the previous CEO tend to award
21:538:45669:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the same high compensation to new incoming CEOs. This suggests that the compensation levels at
21:539:45763:24:24:72:540:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid firms will add competitive pressures to the market for CEO talent. Similarly, we find
21:540:45861:24:24:72:540:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that number-rigid firms do not undo the gains in compensation experienced during number-rigid
21:541:45954:24:25:72:540:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:years when they do adjust the number of options granted. In fact, number-rigid firms actually tend
21:542:46052:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to increase the value of compensation granted during flexible years as compared to a control sample
21:543:46151:24:24:72:540:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of firms that did not grant number-rigid options in the previous year. Thus, number-rigid firms do
21:544:46249:24:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:not follow an “Ss-style model” in which they allow compensation to drift up with returns during
21:545:46344:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigid years and then implement a large adjustment downwards in value or number during flexible
21:546:46438:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:years. If firms followed an Ss-style model, number-rigidity might not exert upward pressure on the
21:547:46536:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation of non-rigid peers, as gains from number-rigidity would be temporary. Finally, we
21:548:46630:24:24:72:540:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:find that executives at number-rigid and non-rigid firms appear to work in integrated rather than
21:549:46727:24:25:72:540:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:segmented labor markets.  That is, executives working at number-rigid firms are no more likely
21:550:46821:25:24:72:540:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:than others to transition to another number-rigid firm. These results suggest that number-rigid and
21:551:46920:24:24:72:372:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:non-rigid firms compete for a common pool of executive talent.
21:552:46982:24:0:88:539:80:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:While we have shown that conditions are conducive to spillovers in pay from number-rigid to non-
22:553:47080:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigid firms, one may question whether such spillovers in value will occur. If firms and/or executives
22:554:47181:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:misperceive the value of options using number, then increases in the value of option pay at number-
22:555:47280:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigid firms would not necessarily apply upward pressure on non-rigid peers. However, in setting pay
22:556:47379:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:levels, most S&P 500 companies rely on private surveys from compensation consultants providing
22:557:47473:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:information on executive pay in similar firms in terms of size and industry. By the beginning of
22:558:47569:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:our sample period, most of these compensation consultants were using Black–Scholes to measure
22:559:47662:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant-date values. Thus, the surveys informing compensation committees about competitive pay
22:560:47754:24:24:72:517:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:levels were based on Black–Scholes and did not distinguish firms making number-rigid grants.
22:561:47846:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To directly investigate whether there are spillovers from number-rigid firms to non-rigid firms,
22:562:47942:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:we examine whether executives without number-rigid option pay tend to have higher compensation
22:563:48036:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:growth when more of their peers are number-rigid and have experienced high recent returns. Specif-
22:564:48134:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:ically, we match each CEO in our sample to CEOs of peer firms. Following Faulkender and Yang
22:565:48226:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(2010), we define peer firms as firms in the same industry (2-digit SIC code) with sales between
22:566:48322:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:50% and 200% of the CEO’s firm. We set the CEO’s compensation date as the date of the largest
22:567:48415:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option grant from the fiscal year. For symmetry, when a CEO does not have an option grant in a
22:568:48509:24:25:72:532:345:119:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:B:fiscal year, we assign an artificial compensation date 270 days prior to the firm’s fiscal year end.4
22:569:48610:25:24:88:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:For each CEO, we then definePercent Peers RigidandPercent Peers Referenceas the percent of
22:570:48700:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:peer CEOs (with compensation dates within the past 365 days) that had number-rigid or number-
22:571:48793:24:24:72:539:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:reference option grants, respectively. We also definePeer Returnsas the average firm return of peer
22:572:48892:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms in the year leading up to each peer’s compensation date. If there are spillovers among peers,
22:573:48991:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:we should see that compensation growth for non-rigid CEOs is higher when more of their peers have
22:574:49088:24:24:72:525:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid (or number-reference) grants and experience high returns leading up to the grant.
22:575:49182:24:24:88:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:The results of this spillovers analysis are shown in Table 2. The dependent variable is the log
22:576:49277:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:change in total compensation. In Columns (1)–(3), the sample consists of all S&P 500 CEOs without
22:577:49374:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:a number-rigid option grant. In Columns (4)–(6), the sample consists of CEOs without a number-
22:578:49468:24:16:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:reference option grant.  As can be seen, we find a significant positive interaction between peer
22:579:49564:16:14:87:539:86:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:4For executives receiving options, 270 days is the median time between the date of their largest option grant and
22:580:49677:14:0:72:174:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:the end of the fiscal year.
23:581:49706:0:25:72:539:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns and peer number focus across all samples and specifications, including with firm fixed effects
23:582:49808:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in Columns (3) and (6). Thus, CEOs with non-rigid option pay experience stronger compensation
23:583:49901:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:growth when their peer group has more number-rigid option pay and higher returns. These results
23:584:49996:24:40:72:466:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:are consistent with spillovers, most likely operating through compensation surveys.

23:586:50103:31:24:72:540:565:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Given the above findings that 1) number-rigidity is prevalent, 2) it leads to outsized option pay
23:587:50200:24:25:72:540:541:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:growth when returns are high, 3) other forms of compensation do not decrease to offset this option
23:588:50298:25:24:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay growth, and 4) there are spillovers onto non-rigid executives, it seems quite plausible that
23:589:50394:24:24:72:540:492:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity could account for a significant portion of overall growth in CEO pay during our
23:590:50489:24:24:72:141:468:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:sample period.
23:591:50503:24:25:88:539:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To give a sense of potential magnitudes, we calibrate a model of equilibrium compensation from
23:592:50597:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Gabaix and Landier (2008) (henceforth, GL). It may appear counterintuitive to use the GL model
23:593:50691:24:24:72:539:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to calibrate equilibrium effects of number-rigidity, as under certain parameter assumptions, the
23:594:50787:24:24:72:540:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:GL model can already explain the growth in compensation during the tech boom without option
23:595:50878:24:25:72:539:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity. However, for the growth in firm size to explainallof the rise in CEO compensation,
23:596:50977:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:one must assume that a key model parameter,-, equals one. The parameter-represents the impact
23:597:51070:24:24:72:539:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f18:B:of CEO skill on firm earnings. When-equals one, this implies constant returns to scale. When-
23:598:51163:24:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is less than one, this implies decreasing returns to scale. GL show evidence that the assumption of
23:599:51262:24:25:72:539:250:119:g_d0_f18:119:g_d0_f5:B:-being equal to one holds from 1992–2004. However, Frydman and Saks (2010) suggest that-is
23:600:51352:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:much closer to zero prior to 1970. In a similar vein, Nagel (2010) shows that the relation following
23:601:51452:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1970 is sensitive to sample-selection. In our own untabulated results, we estimate-equal to 0.48
23:602:51548:24:24:72:183:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in the years 2004–2013.
23:603:51571:24:25:88:539:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:We stress that it is not the goal of this paper to claim that-is less than one or that-did not
23:604:51665:25:24:72:540:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increase during the tech boom. However, we hope to offer a complementary explanation for the rise
23:605:51762:24:24:72:540:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in compensation that is tied to an easily observable empirical pattern (number-rigidity in option
23:606:51859:24:0:72:539:80:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f18:B:compensation that arose only during the tech boom) and does not require assumptions about-
24:607:51951:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:being close to one. In what follows, we show that-=0.5plus number-rigidity can explain the
24:608:52041:25:24:72:366:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:off-trend growth in CEO compensation during the tech boom.
24:609:52099:24:24:88:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:GL’s model implies that, if a fractionfof firms wish to pay their CEO-as much as similarly

24:627:52855:24:25:72:540:403:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:due to differences in the grant date-value of option pay and lack of offsets in non-option pay). We

24:633:53416:24:24:72:540:257:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:can be attributed to number-rigid option grants including spillovers, assuming that growth absent
24:634:53513:24:24:72:540:233:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity would have been zero. We find that number-rigidity can explain more than half of

25:643:54305:25:24:72:332:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of the growth in compensation over the sample period.
25:644:54358:24:24:88:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Our estimates are meant to provide a rough guide for the potential magnitude of the effect of
25:645:54451:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity.  In Table A3 in the Online Appendix , we estimate the effect using a range of
25:646:54545:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:alternative parameter values. While the estimates vary with parameter assumptions, we find that
25:647:54640:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the effect of number-rigidity is likely to be substantial in most cases. We also stress that we calibrate
25:648:54745:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the GL spillovers model because it is tractable and commonly cited in the literature. The GL model
25:649:54843:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:assumes an important role for firm size and that all large firms compete for CEO talent in a fully
25:650:54941:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:integrated labor market (in reality, spillovers may be stronger within compensation peer groups).
25:651:55038:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:However, spillover effects are likely to operate in any competitive environment, even if the exact

25:655:55235:31:24:72:540:348:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Thus far, we have shown that number-rigidity in option pay can account for a substantial portion
25:656:55331:24:25:72:540:324:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of the rise in executive compensation during the tech boom.  Had executives with number-rigid
25:657:55424:25:24:72:540:299:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay been compensated like similarly performing executives without number-rigid pay, aggregate
25:658:55517:24:24:72:540:275:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation growth would have been considerably lower. Next, it is natural to ask why executives
25:659:55614:24:24:72:540:251:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:received number-rigid option pay in the first place. In the remainder of the paper, we examine this
25:660:55713:24:40:72:540:227:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:question. In particular, we attempt to distinguish empirically between two broad classes of theories.
25:661:55814:40:31:72:217:187:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:5.1.1.Optimal Contracting
25:662:55839:31:25:72:540:156:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:The first class of theories are ones in which all parties involved in the compensation-setting process
25:663:55941:25:24:72:540:131:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:understand how to value options but choose to grant the same number of options each year because
25:664:56037:24:35:72:540:107:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:this implements an optimal incentive scheme. For example, firms may grant number-rigid options
25:665:56131:35:0:72:308:72:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:the variable definitions in Gabaix and Landier (2008).
26:666:56187:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to award very steep pay-for-performance incentives. As shown earlier in Fig. 5, number-rigidity
26:667:56282:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:leads to a steeper pay vs. firm return relation than that in a typical non-rigid compensation scheme.
26:668:56383:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:However, in theory, firms could target grant-date value in a flexible manner to implement any desired
26:669:56484:24:24:72:410:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay-for-performance relation without necessarily keeping number fixed.
26:670:56554:24:25:88:539:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Firms may also grant number-rigid options to manage executive ownership. In a classic principal-
26:671:56650:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:agent setting (e.g., Holmstrom, 1979; Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987), optimal CEO ownership is a
26:672:56744:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:function of the cost of managerial effort, the degree of managerial risk aversion, and the randomness
26:673:56845:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of output. To the extent that these factors remain constant over time, a firm may wish to keep CEO
26:674:56943:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:ownership constant as well. Number-rigidity may be one way of achieving that objective. However,
26:675:57039:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in untabulated results, we find that executives with number-rigid pay still experience significant
26:676:57137:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:changes in their fractional ownership as measured by the Jensen–Murphy statistic (Jensen and
26:677:57229:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Murphy, 1990).6This is because options vest over time and executives choose to exercise their vested
26:678:57329:24:25:72:539:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options at different points. In addition, even if number-rigidity did keep CEO ownership fixed, the
26:679:57428:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:above models imply that large stock price increases should lead to at least partial cash compensation
26:680:57529:24:24:72:539:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:offsets in order to prevent slackness in the participation constraint. As we show in the previous
26:681:57626:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:section, there is no evidence of such offsetting declines in cash compensation. Finally, Edmans et al.
26:682:57728:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(2009) show theoretically that with multiplicative managerial production functions/preferences, it
26:683:57826:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is not optimal for a CEO’s fractional ownership to remain constant. Since managerial effort has a
26:684:57923:24:24:72:539:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:larger dollar effect in larger firms, CEOs will work even when having a relatively small equity stake.
26:685:58025:24:25:72:524:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Thus, fractional ownership should decrease when firm size increases due to high equity returns.
26:686:58120:25:24:88:539:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:It is also worth noting that number-rigidity is not implied by other multiplicative compensation
26:687:58216:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:models such as Gabaix and Landier (2008).  According to Gabaix and Landier (2008), holding
26:688:58306:24:24:72:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the firm-CEO match fixed, CEO pay should increase withmarketreturns rather than firm-specific
26:689:58399:24:25:72:470:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns because market returns are a better proxy for an executive’s outside option.
26:690:58483:25:18:88:539:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:A final variation of the first class of theories are ones in which contracting frictions play an
26:691:58579:18:15:87:539:108:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:6The Jensen–Murphy statistic is the dollar change in executive wealth for a $1000 change in firm value and is
26:692:58688:15:11:72:540:93:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:calculated as the executive’s fractional equity ownership [(number of shares held + number of options held * average
26:693:58804:11:10:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:option delta)/(number of shares outstanding)] multiplied by $1000. Option deltas and holdings are computed using
26:694:58916:10:0:72:408:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:the Core and Guay (2002) approximation as implemented by Edmans et al. (2009).
27:695:58996:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:important role. In these theories, number-rigidity may not be optimal in a frictionless world, but
27:696:59094:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:it may be optimal once frictions are taken into account. Moreover, deviations from the first-best
27:697:59191:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:may be minor.  For example, it may be costly to seek shareholder approval for a change in the
27:698:59284:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number of options awarded to a CEO. Such menu costs might lead firms to adopt multi-year fixed
27:699:59378:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number plans (Hall, 1999; Shue and Townsend, 2014). However, when firms do adjust the number
27:700:59470:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options granted, they should undo deviations from the first-best, as in an Ss-style model. As
27:701:59566:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:discussed earlier, however, this does not seem to be the case.  Number-rigid grants followed by
27:702:59661:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:non-rigid grants are usually associated with increases rather than decreases in option pay, both in
27:703:59760:24:40:72:203:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:terms of number and value.
27:704:59786:40:31:72:224:475:119:g_d0_f7:119:g_d0_f7:C:5.1.2.Lack of Sophistication
27:705:59814:31:25:72:540:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:The second broad class of theories we explore include explanations in which at least one party in
27:706:59911:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the compensation-setting process is somewhat unsophisticated about how to value options. Given
27:707:60005:24:24:72:540:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that options are typically granted at-the-money, it is not immediately obvious that granting the
27:708:60101:24:24:72:540:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:same number of new options after a stock price increase would coincide with a pay increase. Fully
27:709:60198:24:25:72:540:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:understanding this notion requires knowledge of option pricing formulas that economists only derived
27:710:60298:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:relatively recently (Black and Scholes, 1973). There is ample anecdotal evidence that when option
27:711:60395:24:24:72:470:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation first came into use, many did not understand or trust these formulas.
27:712:60477:24:24:88:539:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Instead of using option valuation formulas, people may have used the number of options awarded
27:713:60571:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:as a rough proxy for the value of the grant. This heuristic is similar to the well-known phenomenon of
27:714:60673:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:money illusion, or the tendency to think about money in nominal rather than real terms (Kahneman
27:715:60769:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:et al., 1986; Shafir et al., 1997). Given that it is considerably harder to translate number to value
27:716:60870:24:24:72:540:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:for options than it is to translate nominal to real for money, it seems plausible that a similar bias
27:717:60971:24:25:72:540:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:may operate in our context. Along these lines, in Section B in the Online Appendix, we summarize
27:718:61067:25:24:72:539:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:a survey conducted by a large compensation consulting firm.7The survey suggests that executives
27:719:61162:24:18:72:540:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:viewed a decline in the number of options awarded following good performance as unfair, even if

28:722:61368:0:25:72:347:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the decline in number coincided with an increase in value.
28:723:61426:25:24:88:539:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In addition, there were a variety of regulations that emphasized the number rather than value
28:724:61519:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options granted to executives. For example, up until 2006, the SEC only required the number
28:725:61613:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options granted to top executives to be reported in the compensation summary table of proxy
28:726:61707:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:statements. Similarly, FASB did not require the value of at-the-money option grants to be expensed
28:727:61805:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in income statements until 2006. Finally, NYSE and NASD listing requirements also mandated
28:728:61895:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:shareholder approval for only the number of options granted. These regulations likely reflect, but
28:729:61993:24:24:72:450:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:also may have influenced, the way that compensation was commonly measured.
28:730:62067:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Importantly, lack of sophistication in the second class of theories may be on the part of the CEO
28:731:62164:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or other stakeholders such as the board, shareholders, regulators, and/or lower-level employees. For
28:732:62264:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:example, shareholders may impose an outrage constraint that limits executive compensation. How-
28:733:62359:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:ever, if shareholders do not fully understand that the value of compensation granted is rising even
28:734:62458:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:as number of options remains fixed, this outrage constraint may fail to bind. Similarly, if lower-level
28:735:62561:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:employees do not fully understand options, they may demand number-rigid option compensation.
28:736:62653:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Number-rigid compensation may then percolate upwards toward the executive suite as a way to

28:739:62853:31:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We conduct a number of tests to help distinguish between the two classes of theories described
28:740:62947:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:above. In what follows, we present results pointing toward the second class of theories, suggesting
28:741:63046:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that number-rigidity arises primarily from imperfect understanding of option valuation. However,
28:742:63142:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:we cannot rule out the possibility that, for a subset of firms, number-rigidity arises from optimal

28:745:63349:25:24:72:540:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:required to expense or disclose the grant-date dollar value of those options on their income and proxy
28:746:63451:24:24:72:540:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:statements, respectively. If number-rigidity implements an optimal contract, the contract should
28:747:63547:24:0:72:540:80:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:remain optimal regardless of the way option compensation is reported to shareholders. However,
29:748:63643:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:if number-rigidity arises from naïveté on someone’s part, changes in reporting requirements may
29:749:63738:25:24:72:167:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:reduce that naïveté.
29:750:63758:24:24:88:539:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To examine sensitivity to reporting requirements, we exploit two separate reforms by FASB and
29:751:63851:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the SEC that went into effect in 2006. The FASB reform (effective for fiscal years ending after June
29:752:63951:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:15, 2006) required firms to subtract the total Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to all
29:753:64052:25:24:72:539:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:employees from reported earnings. For brevity we will refer to this practice as “required expensing.”
29:754:64153:24:24:72:539:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:The SEC reform (effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006) required firms to disclose
29:755:64254:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to each proxy-named executive on the firm’s
29:756:64349:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:proxy statements. We will refer to this practice as “required disclosure.” We exploit these reforms
29:757:64448:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to test whether number-rigidity declines when option pay is expensed or disclosed transparently
29:758:64543:24:24:72:539:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:in dollar terms to shareholders.  To control for concurrent time trends, we use a differences-in-
29:759:64640:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:differences framework with stock compensation as a control group. Stock compensation also has a
29:760:64735:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number and value associated with it, but its value had to be disclosed and expensed throughout
29:761:64829:25:24:72:539:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:our sample period. Because the two reforms coincide so closely, it is difficult to distinguish their
29:762:64929:24:24:72:539:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:effects empirically. We begin by estimating the combined effect of the two reforms. In particular,
29:763:65027:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:we exclude observations with fiscal years ending between June 15, 2006 and December 15, 2006,
29:764:65120:25:24:72:539:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:because in these fiscal years only the FASB reform was in effect. In subsequent analysis, we attempt
29:765:65220:24:24:72:360:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to separately estimate the effect of expensing and disclosure.
29:766:65282:24:24:88:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Table 3 explores the effects of these reforms. Observations are at the executive by year by grant
29:767:65379:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:type level, where grant type represents option grants or stock grants. The sample is restricted to
29:768:65477:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:S&P 500 CEOs who received the relevant grant type in the current year and in the previous year.
29:769:65572:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Thus, a CEO receiving both stock and options compensation would have two observations per year.
29:770:65667:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Our dependent variable is a number-rigid (number-reference) indicator variable equal to one if the
29:771:65765:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:stock or option grant under observation is number-rigid (number-reference) relative to the grant of
29:772:65864:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the same type in the previous year. We define number-rigid (number-reference) grants for stock
29:773:65958:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:analogously to options (see Section 3.2). The primary independent variables are an indicator equal
29:774:66056:24:0:72:539:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to one if the grant was awarded after the reforms went into effect, an indicator equal to one if the
30:775:66158:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant was in the form of options (rather than stock), and the interaction between the two. The
30:776:66252:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:regressions show that, throughout our sample period, option grants are significantly more likely
30:777:66348:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to be number-rigid than stock grants.  This is consistent with the idea that converting number
30:778:66442:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to value is harder for options than for stock, leading to greater money-illusion type thinking. If
30:779:66540:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option compensation were number-rigid for incentive reasons, for example, to keep CEOs’ ownership
30:780:66637:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:stake at a certain level, one would expect a similar level of number-rigidity for stock compensation.
30:781:66738:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Likewise, one would expect a similar level of number-rigidity for stock compensation if number-
30:782:66833:24:24:72:514:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigidity were primarily designed to ensure that compensation grows one-for-one with returns.
30:783:66925:24:25:88:539:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:We also find that the rule changes had no effect on number-rigidity for stock grants, consistent
30:784:67021:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f7:B:with the fact that the changes only targeted options. In particular, the coefficient onPost-Reforms
30:785:67120:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:is insignificant except for in Column 3, where we do not include controls. Finally, and most impor-
30:786:67219:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:tantly, we estimate a significant negative coefficient on the interaction term. This shows that the
30:787:67318:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:probability of number-rigidity declined more for options than for stock following the rule changes
30:788:67416:25:24:72:506:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:(the difference between number-rigidity in stocks and options is approximately cut in half).
30:789:67508:24:24:88:539:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Note that these results are not driven by a general decline in the use of options following the
30:790:67603:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rule changes.  The use of option compensation did decline after 2006; however, Table 3 shows
30:791:67695:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that, conditional on granting options, the probability that the options were number-rigid declined
30:792:67793:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:significantly. Similarly, our results are not driven by option-granting firms simply reducing option
30:793:67893:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation in the year of the reforms, which would lead to lower number-rigidity that year.
30:794:67986:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:We actually find stronger results if we exclude a larger window around the reforms. Overall, our
30:795:68082:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:findings are consistent with the idea that number-rigidity at least partly results from inattention
30:796:68181:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to value.  However, it remains possible that a subset of firms use number-rigidity to implement
30:797:68276:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:an optimal (or near-optimal) contract along the lines outlined in Section 5.1.1. In particular, the
30:798:68375:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:few firms that continue to use number-rigid option pay after the disclosure and expensing reforms
30:799:68472:25:24:72:540:126:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:may have done so because number-rigidity implements their optimal incentive scheme. Similarly,
30:800:68566:24:24:72:540:102:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:optimal contracting may help explain why, to a lesser extent, number-rigidity also exists for stock
30:801:68665:24:0:72:540:78:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation as shown earlier in Fig. 4 (even though the value of stock compensation is relatively
31:802:68765:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:easy to calculate and had to be expensed and disclosed throughout our sample period). For this
31:803:68859:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:subset of firms, number-rigid stock compensation may again implement an optimal or near-optimal
31:804:68954:24:24:72:177:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation scheme.
31:805:68974:24:24:88:539:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:The above results suggest that some combination of expensing and disclosure reduces number-
31:806:69065:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigidity in option pay. An important remaining question is whether it is primarily expensing or
31:807:69160:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:disclosure that is responsible for the reduction. One approach would be to examine whether number-
31:808:69258:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigidity declined in fiscal years ending between June 15, 2006 and December 15, 2006, when required
31:809:69357:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:expensing was in effect but not required disclosure. Given the shortness of the time window, such
31:810:69454:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:a test has limited statistical power. However, we show in Table A4 in the Online Appendix that
31:811:69548:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:there is indeed a significant decline in number-reference grants during those months, suggesting that
31:812:69649:24:24:72:304:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:expensing without disclosure does have an effect.
31:813:69698:24:24:88:539:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To shed further light on this question, we exploit the fact that, prior to the reforms, some
31:814:69790:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms voluntarily chose to expense and/or disclose. In particular, with the passage of FAS123 in
31:815:69886:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1995, FASB gave firms the option of (1) expensing the Black–Scholes value of option awards or (2)
31:816:69983:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:expensing the intrinsic value, which is zero when options are granted at-the-money, as is typically
31:817:70082:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the case.8Virtually all firms chose to expense the (zero) intrinsic value of option grants until a few
31:818:70184:25:24:72:419:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:years preceding the passage of FAS123r, when some switched voluntarily.
31:819:70255:24:24:88:539:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Similarly, prior to the SEC rule change in 2006, all non-option components of executive pay
31:820:70346:24:24:72:540:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:were stated in dollar terms in the compensation summary table of a proxy statement, while option
31:821:70442:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay was stated in number terms. In the detailed option table, firms had the choice of reporting
31:822:70537:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Black–Scholes value or potential realizable value, which stated what the future intrinsic value of
31:823:70635:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the options would be under 5% and 10% stock price appreciation scenarios. Again, the majority
31:824:70728:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of firms elected not to disclose Black–Scholes value, although some did do so voluntarily (Murphy,
31:825:70826:24:21:72:104:151:119:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:B:1996).9
31:826:70833:21:15:87:539:130:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:8When options were expensed at intrinsic value, a footnote was required stating what earnings would have been
31:827:70942:15:11:72:540:115:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:if firms had instead expensed the total Black–Scholes value of all employee stock options. However this footnote may
31:828:71058:11:11:72:539:104:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:not have been very salient as it did not affect the main reported earnings numbers. In addition many firms prefaced
31:829:71173:11:7:72:423:93:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:the footnote by stating their belief that Black–Scholes was not a sensible methodology.
31:830:71260:7:14:87:540:86:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:9Because potential realizable value also increases proportionally with the stock price, one may argue that even
31:831:71371:14:0:72:540:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:reporting this number should reduce naïveté. However, this information did not appear in the compensation summary
32:832:71486:0:25:88:539:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To test how voluntary expensing and disclosure relate to number-rigidity, we hand collect data
32:833:71580:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:on voluntary expensing from firm 10-K filings. In particular, for each firm that was ever a part of
32:834:71679:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the S&P 500 in our data, we go through its 10-K filings following the passage of FAS123 in October
32:835:71777:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1995. We record the date (if any) that the firm first expensed the Black–Scholes value of option
32:836:71873:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation through 1) the voluntary adoption of the fair value provisions of FAS123 or 2) the
32:837:71968:25:24:72:539:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f7:B:voluntary early adoption of FAS123r.10Based on these dates, we create aVoluntary Expensing
32:838:72058:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:indicator variable equal to one if the firm voluntarily expensed option compensation in a given year.
32:839:72159:24:24:72:540:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Similarly, we create aVoluntary Disclosureindicator variable based on the PCDVALUE variable in
32:840:72253:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Execucomp. For fiscal years ending between December 15, 1996 and June 15, 2006, all firms could
32:841:72348:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:choose to expense or disclose. Therefore, for this sample period, we regress number-rigidity on both
32:842:72448:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the voluntary expensing and voluntary disclosure indicators. The results are shown in Table 4. To
32:843:72545:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increase power, we expand our sample to include all top executives (rather than only CEOs) at
32:844:72638:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:firms that were ever a part of the S&P 500 during our sample period. We find that grants become
32:845:72733:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:significantly less likely to be number-rigid and number-reference when firms voluntarily expense, but
32:846:72834:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:voluntary disclosure has a statistically insignificant effect. The results remain relatively unchanged
32:847:72936:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:with the inclusion of firm fixed effects in Columns (2) and (4). Thus, it does not appear that the
32:848:73034:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:results are driven by time-invariant unobservable differences between the types of firms that choose
32:849:73134:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to expense or disclose and those that choose not to. Overall, these results show that expensing the
32:850:73233:24:24:72:539:272:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant-date value of options (which leads to lower reported earnings) has a greater effect on how the
32:851:73333:24:25:72:540:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:cost of option awards is viewed than merely disclosing the value. One reason may be that proxy
32:852:73427:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:disclosures do not reflect the views of the CEO or board but are merely made by accountants and
32:853:73522:24:24:72:194:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:lawyers hired by the firm.
32:854:73548:24:24:88:539:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Finally, in Table 5, we test how various board characteristics relate to number-rigidity.  To
32:855:73641:24:25:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:further increase power, we expand our sample to include all top executives at firms that were ever
32:856:73739:25:11:72:540:126:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:table and thus may have been less salient. Moreover, potential realizable value represents a scenario analysis and
32:857:73853:11:11:72:540:115:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:thus is less likely to be viewed as a measure of the grant’scurrentvalue. In fact, because potential realizable value
32:858:73970:11:11:72:540:104:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:is tied to the intrinsic value of the options, this measure may still encourage the idea that the current value is zero
32:859:74089:11:7:72:174:93:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:for at-the-money options.
32:860:74114:7:14:83:539:86:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:10FAS123r was issued in December 2004. After its issuance, firms did not have to adopt it until their first fiscal
32:861:74228:14:0:72:457:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:year starting after June 15, 2006. However, some firms adopted it before they were required to.
33:862:74325:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:a part of the S&P 1500 during our sample period. It is plausible that firms with more independent
33:863:74422:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or sophisticated boards are more likely to choose optimal compensation structures or to be aware
33:864:74518:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of option valuation methods. We find that boards with a greater percentage of directors that are
33:865:74614:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:independent, a greater percentage of independent directors that joined before the current CEO, or a
33:866:74713:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:greater percentage of independent directors with an MBA degree are significantly less likely to grant
33:867:74814:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigid options. This again cuts against the first class of theories, in which number-rigidity
33:868:74913:24:24:72:540:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:arises from optimal contracting, as it seems that number-rigidity is correlated with proxies for worse
33:869:75015:24:40:72:127:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:governance.

33:871:75044:31:24:72:540:468:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Given that transparency and governance reduce number-rigidity, one may wonder whether CEOs
33:872:75134:24:25:72:540:444:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and/or boards always understood the value-implications of number-rigidity.  To investigate the
33:873:75228:25:24:72:540:419:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:degree of CEO/board sophistication, we examine whether the probability of CEOs receiving number-
33:874:75324:24:24:72:540:395:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigid grants is asymmetric with respect to firm returns. If CEOs or boards are sophisticated about
33:875:75422:24:24:72:540:371:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:option valuation and want to reward good performance and also to bound losses following poor
33:876:75514:24:25:72:540:347:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:performance, they would implement number-rigid pay when their firm had positive returns but
33:877:75605:25:24:72:540:322:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:not when their firm had negative returns. Panel A of Figure 8 shows a local linear regression in
33:878:75701:24:24:72:540:298:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:which the number-rigid indicator is regressed on firm returns in the year prior to the option grant
33:879:75800:24:24:72:540:274:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:date. We limit the sample to CEOs of firms that were ever a part of the S&P 500 over our sample
33:880:75895:24:25:72:540:250:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:period and use the Epanichnikov kernel with the rule-of-thumb bandwidth. We find that, indeed,
33:881:75989:25:24:72:540:225:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the probability of a CEO receiving number-rigid pay following very positive returns (when rigidity
33:882:76087:24:24:72:540:201:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:would lead to large pay increases) is considerably higher than the probability following very negative
33:883:76189:24:24:72:540:177:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:returns (when rigidity would lead to large pay declines). This asymmetry is consistent with at least
33:884:76289:24:25:72:540:153:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:some CEOs or boards recognizing that the value of the same number of new options varies with
33:885:76381:25:24:72:540:128:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:their firm’s stock price. Panel B shows that the asymmetry is weaker among the sample of all S&P
33:886:76477:24:24:72:148:104:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:1500 executives.
33:887:76493:24:0:88:539:80:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In contrast to the previous result, we also find evidence suggesting that some CEOs do endure
34:888:76588:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:large losses in value due to number-rigidity. Specifically, we examine whether executives continue to
34:889:76689:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:receive the same (non-split adjusted) number of options as in the previous year following a positive
34:890:76789:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:stock split. The compensation survey cited earlier suggests this may be the case. The survey finds
34:891:76887:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that, following a split, roughly half of number-rigid firms hold their (non-split adjusted) number
34:892:76985:24:25:72:539:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:of options fixed.  The report concludes that: “Stock splits also offer an opportunity to readjust
34:893:77082:25:24:72:540:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant levels, moving back toward more competitive levels, without jolting employees’ perceptions
34:894:77178:24:24:72:244:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:or expectations quite so drastically.”
34:895:77216:24:24:88:539:539:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:To more formally test whether there is evidence of such behavior, we limit our sample to firms
34:896:77310:24:25:72:540:515:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:that engaged in a positive stock split between the time of the previous option grant and the current
34:897:77410:25:24:72:540:490:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:grant. Panel A of Fig. 9 shows the distribution of growth in the (non-split-adjusted) number of
34:898:77505:24:24:72:540:466:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options granted in the current year relative to the previous year. For both the sample of S&P 500
34:899:77602:24:24:72:540:442:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:CEOs and S&P 1500 Top Executives, following a stock split, the modal percentage change in the
34:900:77695:24:25:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number of options granted is 100%; this corresponds to split-adjusted number-rigidity following a
34:901:77792:25:24:72:540:393:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:2-for-1 split. However, the second most common occurrence is for the number of options granted to
34:902:77889:24:24:72:540:369:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:remain the same as in the previous year, despite the split. This is in contrast to stock compensation,
34:903:77991:24:25:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:where, following a split, very few executives receive the same number of shares as they did in the
34:904:78089:25:24:72:540:320:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:previous year.  Overall, these results are consistent with naïveté regarding options.  Following
34:905:78185:24:24:72:540:296:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:positive stock splits, CEOs who continue to receive the same number of options typically experience
34:906:78284:24:24:72:415:272:119:g_d0_f5:64:g_d0_f8:B:a 50% decline in the value of their option compensation, all else equal.11
34:907:78358:24:25:88:539:248:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:In Panel B of Fig.  9, we explore whether the decline in option compensation from lack of
34:908:78447:25:24:72:540:223:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:split-adjustments is offset by an increase in non-option compensation. The sample is limited to the
34:909:78546:24:24:72:540:199:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:set of observations in which the (non-split-adjusted) number of options awarded remains constant
34:910:78642:24:24:72:540:175:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:following a positive stock split. The figure plots the change in non-option compensation against
34:911:78738:24:21:72:540:151:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the loss in value due to the lack of split adjustment in the number of options granted. The dotted
34:912:78836:21:15:83:540:130:36:g_d0_f9:80:g_d0_f10:F:11One important concern is that the above results may be driven by reporting errors. In our analysis, we assume
34:913:78947:15:11:72:540:115:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:that, as required by the SEC, firms report their compensation for the previous fiscal year in terms of the correct
34:914:79061:11:11:72:540:104:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:units as of the proxy date. It is possible that some firms violate these requirements. However, the most obvious type
34:915:79178:11:11:72:540:93:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:of potential reporting errors would actually lead us to find a smaller spike at zero in Panel A of Fig. 9 than exists
34:916:79295:11:10:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:in reality. Moreover, we confirm that our results are very similar using only observations that are unlikely to have
34:917:79411:10:0:72:506:72:80:g_d0_f10:80:g_d0_f10:F:reporting errors as well as using alternative data sources. See Section C of the Online Appendix for details.
35:918:79522:0:25:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:line shows the change in other compensation necessary to fully offset these losses. The solid line
35:919:79620:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:represents the relation between the actual change in non-option compensation and the losses due
35:920:79715:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to the lack of the split adjustment, as estimated using a local linear regression. As can be seen,
35:921:79813:24:24:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:the smoothed regression line is relatively flat. Moreover, the difference between the two lines is also
35:922:79916:24:25:72:540:612:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:statistically significant in a linear regression. Thus, non-option compensation does not change to
35:923:80014:25:24:72:539:587:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:offset the loss of option compensation due to the lack of split adjustment. Again, these findings seem
35:924:80116:24:49:72:529:563:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:to run counter to optimal contracting theories, in which all parties understand option valuation.
35:925:80213:49:35:72:175:514:206:g_d0_f4:206:g_d0_f4:C:6.Conclusion
35:926:80225:35:24:72:540:479:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Several theories have been proposed to explain the dramatic rise in CEO pay during the 1990s
35:927:80317:24:24:72:540:455:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and early 2000s. In this paper, we explore an alternative and complementary explanation, based
35:928:80411:24:24:72:540:431:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:on the observation that there is a high degree of rigidity in the number of options CEOs receive.
35:929:80508:24:25:72:540:407:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:Number-rigidity in option compensation implies that the grant-date value of option pay will grow
35:930:80604:25:24:72:540:382:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:with firm equity returns, which were very high on average during the tech boom. We also show that
35:931:80701:24:24:72:539:358:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:salary, bonus, and other non-option compensation did not adjust downward to offset the rigidity-
35:932:80797:24:24:72:540:334:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:induced increases in option pay. Moreover, there are compensation spillovers from executives that
35:933:80894:24:25:72:540:310:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:receive number-rigid option pay to those that do not. Finally, we present evidence that number-
35:934:80989:25:24:72:540:285:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:rigidity arises from a lack of sophistication about option valuation that is akin to money illusion.
35:935:81089:24:24:72:540:261:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:In particular, we show that number-rigidity is more prevalent for option compensation than stock
35:936:81185:24:24:72:539:237:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:compensation, which is easier to value. Moreover, option number-rigiditydeclinesrelative to stock
35:937:81282:24:25:72:540:213:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity when firms (voluntarily or involuntarily) begin to disclose and expense the grant-
35:938:81380:25:24:72:540:188:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:date value of their option pay. In particular, firms are significantly less likely grant number-rigid
35:939:81481:24:24:72:540:164:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:options if they expense the grant-date value of options on their income statements. Finally, improved
35:940:81582:24:24:72:390:140:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:governance also corresponds to reduced number-rigidity in options.
35:941:81648:24:25:88:539:116:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:A:Overall, we conclude that number-rigidity in options can explain a substantial portion of the
35:942:81741:25:0:72:539:91:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:off-trend growth in CEO compensation during the tech boom. Number-rigidity can also explain the
36:943:81838:0:25:72:539:709:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:increased dispersion in CEO pay, the difference in pay growth between the US and other countries,
36:944:81935:25:24:72:540:684:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:and the increased correlation between pay and firm-specific equity returns. Finally, the decline in
36:945:82034:24:24:72:540:660:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:number-rigidity, resulting from changes in reporting requirements, helps to explain why executive
36:946:82131:24:0:72:502:636:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f5:B:pay increased less with the high equity returns during the housing boom in the mid-2000s.

37:950:82364:12:12:72:540:677:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:that were ever a part of the S&P 500 from 1992 to 2010. The height of each bar represents the median level of
37:951:82473:12:12:72:540:665:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:total compensation each year in 2011 dollars. In addition, each bar is decomposed into the mean proportion
37:952:82579:12:12:72:540:653:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:represented by each component of compensation in each year. The bonus component includes compensation
37:953:82680:12:12:72:540:641:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:included in non-equity incentive plans and long-term incentive plans. All components of compensation are
37:954:82784:12:189:72:384:629:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:calculated using grant-date values instead of realized values at exercise.

40:1027:84802:10:12:72:540:690:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:This figure plots changes in the log grant date value of new options against the log firm return over the

42:1039:85555:11:12:72:540:689:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:In this figure we calibrate an equilibrium model CEO pay from Gabaix and Landier (2008) to estimate the

42:1043:85967:12:12:72:539:641:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:(an assumption that is approximately true within our sample). The parameter-is equal to the average

47:1090:94796:10:12:72:540:690:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:This table shows how the prevalence of number-rigid and number-reference option grants change relative to
47:1091:94901:12:12:72:539:678:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:stock grants after the FASB and SEC reforms in 2006. The FASB reform (effective for fiscal years ending
47:1092:95004:12:12:72:540:666:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:after June 15, 2006) required firms to subtract the total Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to
47:1093:95112:12:12:72:540:654:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:employees from earnings. The SEC reform (effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006) required
47:1094:95220:12:12:72:540:642:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:firms to disclose the Black–Scholes value of option compensation paid to each top executives on their proxy
47:1095:95327:12:12:72:540:630:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:statements. Stock compensation also has a number and value associated with it, but its value had to be
47:1096:95429:12:12:72:540:618:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:disclosed and expensed throughout our sample period. Observations with fiscal years ending between June

47:1098:95641:12:12:72:540:594:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:Observations are at the executive by year by grant type level, where grant type represents option grants or
47:1099:95748:12:12:72:540:582:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:stock grants. The sample is restricted to S&P 500 CEOs who received the relevant grant type in the current
47:1100:95854:12:12:72:540:570:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:year and in the previous year. Thus, a CEO receiving both stock and options compensation would have two
47:1101:95957:12:12:72:540:558:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:observations for that year. Our dependent variable is a number-rigid (number-reference) indicator variable
47:1102:96063:12:12:72:540:546:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:equal to one if the stock or option grant under observation is number-rigid (number-reference) relative to
47:1103:96169:12:12:72:540:534:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:the grant of the same type in the previous year. We define number-rigid (number-reference) grants for stock

47:1105:96382:12:12:72:539:510:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:granted following the two reforms (fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006). The variableOptionsis an
