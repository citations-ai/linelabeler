2:37:2054:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  recast  the  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett  model  of  income  and  wealth  distribution  in  continuous 
2:38:2157:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:time. This workhorse model – as well as heterogeneous agent models more generally – then boils 
2:39:2251:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:down to a system of partial differential equations, a fact we take advantage of to make two types 
2:40:2348:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:of contributions. First, a number of new theoretical results: (i) an analytic characterization of the 
2:41:2449:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:consumption  and  saving behavior  of  the  poor,  particularly  their  marginal  propensities  to 
2:42:2547:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:consume; (ii) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income 
2:43:2645:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:types;  (iii)  a  proof  that  there  is  a  unique stationary  equilibrium  if  the  intertemporal  elasticity  of 
2:44:2760:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:substitution  is  weakly  greater  than  one;  (iv) characterization  of  “soft”  borrowing  constraints. 
2:45:2865:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:Second,  we  develop  a  simple,  efficient  and  portable algorithm  for  numerically  solving  for 
2:46:2965:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:equilibria  in  a  wide  class  of  heterogeneous  agent  models,  including – but  not  limited  to  –  the 
2:47:3072:14:28:72:233:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.

3:80:3755:0:31:72:179:720:17:g_d0_f5:17:g_d0_f5:C:Introduction
3:81:3767:31:17:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:One of the key developments in macroeconomics research over the last three decades has been
3:82:3858:17:17:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the incorporation of explicit heterogeneity into models of the macroeconomy.  Fueled by the
3:83:3949:17:17:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:increasing availability of high-quality micro data,  the advent of more powerful computing
3:84:4039:17:16:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:methods as well as rising inequality in many advanced economies, such heterogeneous agent
3:85:4128:16:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:models  have  proliferated  and  are  now  ubiquitous.   This  is  a  welcome  development  for  a
3:86:4226:17:17:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:number of reasons.  First, it opens up the door to bringing micro data to the table in order
3:87:4318:17:17:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to empirically discipline macro theories.  Second, macroeconomists often want to analyze the
3:88:4410:17:16:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:welfare implications of particular shocks or policies.  This is impossible without asking “who
3:89:4504:16:17:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:gains and who loses?”, that is, distributional considerations often cannot be ignored.  Third,
3:90:4598:17:17:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:models with heterogeneity often deliver strikingly different aggregate implications than do
3:91:4689:17:20:72:515:521:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:representative agent models, for example with respect to monetary and fiscal policies.1
3:92:4776:20:17:89:539:501:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Despite the continuously increasing popularity of macroeconomic models with rich het-
3:93:4861:17:16:71:539:484:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:erogeneity,  the  literature  has  suffered  from  a  dearth  of  theoretical  and  analytical  results.
3:94:4965:16:17:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Little is known about the properties of consumption and saving behavior in the presence of
3:95:5055:17:17:71:539:451:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:borrowing constraints, those of the resulting wealth distribution, and equilibrium uniqueness
3:96:5148:17:17:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(or lack thereof).  Instead, most studies rely on purely numerical analyses to characterize the
3:97:5243:17:16:71:539:417:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:implications of such theories.  But even such computational approaches are often difficult
3:98:5333:16:17:71:539:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and costly, particularly if the question at hand requires solving for the economy’s transition
3:99:5427:17:20:71:454:384:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:dynamics or if the model features non-differentiabilities or non-convexities.
3:100:5504:20:17:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In this paper we make some progress on these issues by recasting the standard incomplete
3:101:5592:17:16:71:539:347:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market model ofAiyagari(1994),Bewley(1986) andHuggett(1993) in continuous time. Our
3:102:5675:16:17:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:main contributions are twofold.  First, we prove a number of new theoretical results about
3:103:5765:17:17:72:539:314:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:this workhorse model.2Second,  we develop a simple,  efficient and portable algorithm for
3:104:5854:17:17:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:numerically  solving  both  stationary  equilibria  and  transition  dynamics  of  a  wide  class  of
3:105:5955:17:17:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:heterogeneous agent models, including – but not limited to – the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett
3:106:6043:17:19:72:106:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:model.
3:107:6049:19:17:89:539:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Both types of contributions make use of an important property: when recast in continuous
3:108:6137:17:17:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time, heterogeneous agent models boil down to systems of two coupled partial differential
3:109:6226:17:17:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equations.  The first of these is a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the optimal
3:110:6316:17:16:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:choices of a single atomistic individual who takes the evolution of the distribution and hence
3:111:6410:16:19:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:prices  as  given.   And  the  second  is  a  Kolmogorov  Forward  (KF)  equation  characterizing
3:112:6507:19:15:85:539:158:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:1Deaton  (2016)  succinctly  summarizes  the  second  and  third  reasons:  “While  we  often  must  focus  on
3:113:6617:15:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:aggregates for macroeconomic policy, it is impossible to think coherently about national well-being while ig-
3:114:6726:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:noring inequality and poverty, neither of which is visible in aggregate data.  Indeed, and except in exceptional
3:115:6838:12:9:72:376:119:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:cases, macroeconomic aggregates themselves depend on distribution.”
3:116:6905:9:15:85:539:110:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:2Of course and as is well-known, the unadorned Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model is not sufficiently rich to
3:117:7009:15:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:be an empirically realistic theory of income and wealth distribution.  Understanding its theoretical properties
3:118:7120:12:0:72:514:83:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:is nevertheless important, simply because it forms the backbone of much of modern macroeconomics.
4:119:7218:0:16:72:539:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  evolution  of  the  distribution,  given  optimal  choices  of  individuals.3In  the  context  of
4:120:7320:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett  model,  the  HJB  equation  characterizes  individuals’  optimal
4:121:7414:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consumption and saving behavior given a stochastic process for income; and the KF equation
4:122:7504:17:17:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:characterizes the evolution of the joint distribution of income and wealth.  The two equations
4:123:7598:17:17:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are coupled because optimal consumption and saving depend on the interest rate which is
4:124:7685:17:16:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:determined in equilibrium and hence depends on the wealth distribution.  We start with a
4:125:7773:16:17:72:539:620:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:particularly  parsimonious  case:  aHuggett(1993)  economy  in  which  idiosyncratic  income
4:126:7865:17:17:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:risk takes the form of exogenous endowment shocks that follow a two-state Poisson process
4:127:7954:17:17:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and in which individuals save in unproductive bonds that are in fixed supply.  Later in the
4:128:8045:17:16:72:539:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:paper, we extend many of our results to more general stochastic processes and to anAiyagari
4:129:8136:16:17:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(1994) economy in which individuals save in productive capital and income takes the form
4:130:8224:17:20:72:155:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of labor income.
4:131:8240:20:17:89:539:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We prove four new theoretical results about the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.First,
4:132:8324:17:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we provide an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behavior of the poor.
4:133:8415:17:16:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We show that, under natural assumptions,4an individual’s saving policy function behaves
4:134:8502:16:0:72:102:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f11:B:like−

4:137:8588:17:17:72:539:449:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from this constraint andνis a constant that depends on parameters.  Equivalently, her con-
4:138:8678:17:0:72:347:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sumption function behaves like her total income plus

4:140:8731:10:17:361:540:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:2νa.  This characterization implies
4:141:8766:17:16:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that: (i) individuals necessarily hit the borrowing constraint in finite time after a long enough
4:142:8863:16:17:72:539:399:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sequence of low income shocks, (ii) we have an intuitive characterization of the speedνat
4:143:8952:17:17:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which an individual does so as well as hermarginal propensity to consume(MPC) out of a
4:144:9038:17:17:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:windfall income gain.  This MPC is higher the lower is the interest rate relative to the rate of
4:145:9134:17:16:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time preference, the more willing to intertemporally substitute individuals are, or the higher
4:146:9228:16:17:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is the likelihood of getting a high income draw; it is non-monotone in the income received
4:147:9318:17:17:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in low-income states (e.g.  unemployment benefits).  Understanding the theoretical determi-
4:148:9409:17:17:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:nants of MPCs is, of course, important for a large body of applied work.5Second, we derive
4:149:9499:17:17:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:an analytic solution for the wealth distribution for a special case with two income types. This
4:150:9594:17:16:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:analytic solution provides a clean characterization of various properties of the wealth distri-
4:151:9689:16:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:bution, particularly the behavior of its left and right tails.  For example, a direct corollary
4:152:9784:18:16:85:539:230:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:3Lasry and Lions(2007) have termed such systems “Mean Field Games” in analogy to the continuum
4:153:9878:16:12:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:limit often taken in statistical mechanics and physics, e.g.  when solving the Ising model.  We build on their
4:154:9988:12:12:72:539:202:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:earlier work.  Also seeGu ́eant,  Lasry,  and Lions(2011) andCardialaguet(2013) and the references cited
4:155:10092:12:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:therein.  The “Kolmogorov Forward equation” is also often called “Fokker-Planck equation.” Because the
4:156:10194:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:term “Kolmogorov Forward equation” seems to be somewhat more widely used in economics, we will use
4:157:10292:12:8:72:518:166:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:this convention throughout the paper.  But these are really two different names for the same equation.
4:158:10394:8:15:85:539:158:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:4Namely  that  either  the  borrowing  constraint  is  tighter  than  the  natural  borrowing  constraint  or  the
4:159:10508:15:9:72:464:143:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:coefficient of absolute risk aversion is bounded as consumption approaches zero (or both).
4:160:10598:9:15:85:539:134:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:5The  distribution  of  MPCs  determines,  for  example,  the  efficacy  of  fiscal  stimulus  (e.g.Kaplan  and
4:161:10709:15:12:72:539:119:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Violante,2014;Hagedorn, Manovski, and Mitman,2017), the transition mechanism of monetary policy (e.g.
4:162:10810:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Auclert,2017;Kaplan, Moll, and Violante,2016), the effect of a credit crunch or house price movements on
4:163:10914:12:12:72:539:95:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:consumer spending (e.g.Guerrieri and Lorenzoni,2017;Berger, Guerrieri, Lorenzoni, and Vavra,2015) and
4:164:11015:12:0:72:488:83:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the extent to which inequality affects aggregate demand (e.g.Auclert and Rognlie,2016,2017).
5:165:11108:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of individuals hitting the borrowing constraint in finite time is that the wealth distribution
5:166:11202:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:features a Dirac point mass at this constraint.Third, we prove existence and uniqueness of a
5:167:11294:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:stationary equilibrium for general utility functions and income processes under the intuitive
5:168:11387:17:17:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:condition that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES)−u′(c)/(u′′(c)c) is weakly
5:169:11478:17:17:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:greater than one for all consumption levelsc.6Without a uniqueness result the economy
5:170:11563:17:16:72:539:636:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:could, in principle, be subject to poverty traps and history dependence.7Fourth, we con-
5:171:11651:16:17:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sider “soft borrowing constraints”,  i.e.  a wedge between borrowing and saving rates,  and
5:172:11742:17:17:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:characterize their implication for saving behavior and the wealth distribution.  This form of
5:173:11835:17:17:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:constraint can explain the empirical observation that wealth distributions typically have a
5:174:11926:17:19:72:437:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:spike at zero net worth and mass both to the left and the right of zero.
5:175:11998:19:17:89:539:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In  addition  to  these  results,  which  are  new  also  relative  to  the  existing  discrete-time
5:176:12098:17:17:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:literature, we extend some useful existing discrete-time results and concepts to continuous
5:177:12189:17:17:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time.   First,  we  adapt  a  number  of  results  fromAiyagari(1994),  e.g.   that  the  wealth
5:178:12285:17:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:distribution has a finite upper bound and that a stationary equilibrium exists.  Second, we
5:179:12376:17:16:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:characterize the saving behavior of the wealthy and show that, with constant relative risk
5:180:12466:16:17:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:aversion (CRRA) utility,  consumption and saving policy functions become linear for high
5:181:12554:17:17:72:539:449:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealth (Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu,2015;Benhabib and Bisin,2016).  Third, we show how
5:182:12637:17:17:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to define in continuous time marginal propensities to consume and save over discrete time
5:183:12726:17:16:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:intervals.  This is not obvious and, at the same time, important for bringing the model to the
5:184:12820:16:17:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:data. Finally, a methodological contribution of our paper is to show how to handle borrowing
5:185:12912:17:17:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:constraints  in  continuous  time:  conveniently,  the  borrowing  constraint  never  binds  in  the
5:186:13012:17:17:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:interior of the state space and only shows up in a boundary condition.8The consumption
5:187:13098:17:16:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:first-order condition always holds with equality, thereby sidestepping any complications due
5:188:13190:16:20:72:454:332:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to “occasionally binding constraints.” Many of our proofs exploit this fact.
5:189:13266:20:17:89:539:312:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As  already  mentioned,  our  second  main  contribution  is  the  development  of  a  simple,
5:190:13360:17:17:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:efficient and portable numerical algorithm for computing a wide class of heterogeneous agent
5:191:13452:17:17:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:models.  The algorithm is based on a finite difference method and applies to the computation
5:192:13544:17:16:72:539:261:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of both stationary and time-varying equilibria.9We explain this algorithm in the context
5:193:13632:16:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of  the  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett  model.   But  the  algorithm  is,  in  fact,  considerably  more
5:194:13730:18:15:85:539:227:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:6In addition we assume for the uniqueness result that individuals cannot borrow.  A key step in our proof
5:195:13835:15:12:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:is an important result by Olivi (2017).  Contemporaneous work by Light (2017) derives a uniqueness result
5:196:13940:12:12:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:under more restrictive assumptions in a discrete-time setting:  he proves uniqueness for an Aiyagari economy
5:197:14048:12:12:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:with CRRA utility and Cobb-Douglas production (as well as no borrowing) under the assumption that the
5:198:14149:12:8:72:216:176:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:constant IES is greater than one.
5:199:14182:8:16:85:539:168:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:7For the same reasons, one of the first result that every graduate student learns is that the neoclassical
5:200:14288:16:8:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:growth model – the representative-agent counterpart to the Aiyagari model – features a unique steady state.
5:201:14395:8:16:85:539:144:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:8This is in contrast to discrete-time formulations where there is typically a critical level of wealth, strictly
5:202:14507:16:8:72:498:128:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:bigger than the borrowing constraint, such that the constraint binds for all lower levels of wealth.
5:203:14607:8:16:85:540:120:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:9Our numerical method is based on Achdou and Capuzzo-Dolcetta(2010) andAchdou(2013) but modified
5:204:14703:16:12:72:539:104:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:to handle the particular features of heterogeneous agent models, in particular borrowing constraints.Candler
5:205:14811:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:(1999) has previously used a finite difference method to solve HJB equations arising in economics and we
5:206:14915:12:0:72:272:80:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:discuss the relation to his work in Section3.7.
6:207:14963:0:16:72:539:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:general and applies toanyheterogeneous agent model with a continuum of atomistic agents
6:208:15050:16:17:71:539:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(and without aggregate shocks).  In Section 4 we demonstrate the algorithm’s generality by
6:209:15140:17:17:71:539:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:applying it to other theories that feature non-convexities, a fat-tailed wealth distribution and
6:210:15236:17:17:71:539:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:multiple assets.  Codes for these applications (and many more) are available fromhttp://
6:211:15324:17:20:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:www.princeton.edu/∼moll/HACTproject.htmin Matlab as well as Python, Julia and C++.
6:212:15406:20:16:89:539:633:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The  first  step  of  the  algorithm  is  to  solve  the  HJB  equation  for  a  given  time  path  of
6:213:15508:16:17:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:prices.  The second step is to solve the KF equation for the evolution of the joint distribution
6:214:15604:17:17:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of income and wealth.  Conveniently, after having solved the HJB equation, one obtains the
6:215:15694:17:17:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time path of the distribution essentially “for free,” i.e.  with very few lines of code.  This is
6:216:15791:17:16:71:539:566:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:because the KF equation is the “transpose problem” of the HJB equation.10The third step
6:217:15878:16:17:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is to iterate and repeat the first two steps until an equilibrium fixed point for the time path
6:218:15973:17:17:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of prices is found.  For the first step, we make use of the theory of “viscosity solutions” to
6:219:16067:17:17:72:539:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:HJB equations (Crandall and Lions,1983), and the corresponding theory for their numerical

6:221:16247:17:16:72:539:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be read without knowledge of the theory of viscosity solutions, Online AppendixC.1provides
6:222:16337:16:20:72:534:466:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:an “economist-friendly” introduction and lists a number of relatively accessible references.
6:223:16429:20:17:89:539:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Continuous time imparts a number of computational advantages relative to discrete time.
6:224:16516:17:17:72:539:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:As explained in more detail in Section3.1, these relate to the handling of borrowing con-
6:225:16605:17:16:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:straints, the numerical solution of first-order conditions and the fact that continuous-time
6:226:16697:16:17:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:problems with discretized state space are, by construction, very “sparse.” These computa-
6:227:16786:17:17:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tional advantages are reflected in the algorithm’s efficiency.  Just to give a flavor, computing

6:229:16973:17:16:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the wealth dimension using Matlab takes around a quarter second on a Macbook Pro lap-
6:230:17061:16:17:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:top computer.  At the same time,  the algorithm is simple.  Implementing it requires only
6:231:17150:17:17:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:some  basic  knowledge  of  matrix  algebra  and  access  to  a  software  package  that  can  solve
6:232:17250:17:17:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sparse  linear  systems  (e.g.   Matlab).   Finally,  the  algorithm  is  portable.   For  example,  it

6:234:17445:17:16:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:These are difficult to handle with standard discrete-time methods.11In contrast, viscosity

6:236:17623:17:17:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:convex problems.  To illustrate this, we use the same algorithm to compute equilibria of an
6:237:17714:17:17:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:economy in which the interplay of indivisible housing and mortgages with a down-payment

7:257:19531:17:17:71:539:519:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in economies with a large number of individual state variables (four or more) by marrying
7:258:19620:17:17:71:539:502:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:our finite difference method with a sparse grid approach (Bungartz and Griebel,2004;Ger-

7:262:19899:17:17:71:539:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:neous households are subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks.  SeeHeathcote, Storeslet-

7:265:20162:17:20:71:338:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Sargent(2004).  All of these are set in discrete time.
7:266:20216:20:17:89:539:362:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Much fewer papers have studied equilibrium models with heterogeneous households in
7:267:20298:17:16:71:539:345:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:continuous time.12All of these papers make “just the right assumptions” about the envi-
7:268:20385:16:17:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ronment being studied so that equilibria can be solved explicitly (or at least characterized
7:269:20477:17:17:71:539:312:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tightly).13In contrast, our aim is to develop tools for solving and analyzing models that do
7:270:20569:17:17:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not permit closed-form solutions.  Our methods apply as long as the model under consid-
7:271:20656:17:17:71:539:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:eration can be boiled down to an HJB equation and a KF equation, a feature shared by a
7:272:20742:17:16:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wide class of heterogeneous agent models.  These two approaches are clearly complimentary:
7:273:20832:16:17:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on the one hand, having explicit solutions is often extremely valuable for gaining intuition;
7:274:20925:17:17:71:539:228:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on the other hand, restricting attention to environments for which these can be found may
7:275:21014:17:18:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:represent a sort of “analytic straitjacket” for some applications and the availability of more

7:279:21392:12:12:71:539:154:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:andBenhabib, Perla, and Tonetti(2017) analyze theories with heterogeneous producers.  These papers, like
7:280:21496:12:12:71:539:142:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:ours, all study economies with a continuum of heterogeneous agents giving rise to a system of coupled HJB
7:281:21601:12:12:71:539:130:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and  KF  equations.   In  contrast,  other  papers  study  environments  with  a  finite  number  of  heterogeneous
7:282:21716:12:12:71:539:118:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:agents (typically equal to two).  For example, seeScheinkman and Weiss(1986) and applications of their
7:283:21818:12:8:71:472:106:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:framework byConze, Lasry, and Scheinkman(1993) andLippi, Ragni, and Trachter(2013).
7:284:21901:8:16:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:13Similarly, there are also several discrete-time approaches for retaining tractability in environments with
7:285:22009:16:0:71:533:82:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:heterogeneous households (e.g.B ́enabou,2002;Krebs,2003;Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante,2014).
8:286:22110:0:19:72:336:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:general methods may prove useful in such contexts.
8:287:22160:19:17:89:540:701:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:One other paper by Bayer and W ̈alde(2010) also studies a continuous-time version of
8:288:22244:17:17:71:539:684:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:an  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett  model.   The  main  differences  between  their  paper  and  ours
8:289:22338:17:17:71:539:667:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are:  (i) they analyze a partial equilibrium framework whereas we consider a general equi-
8:290:22428:17:17:71:539:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:librium framework,  and (ii) we develop a numerical algorithm for solving both stationary
8:291:22517:17:16:71:539:633:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and  time-varying  equilibria,  thereby  actually  “operationalizing”  the  analysis  of  this  class
8:292:22618:16:17:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of models.14,15Also closely related,Rocheteau, Weill, and Wong(2015) propose an elegant
8:293:22705:17:17:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:alternative general equilibrium model with incomplete markets in continuous time.  Market
8:294:22794:17:17:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:incompleteness in their framework stems from lumpy consumption expenditure shocks (e.g.
8:295:22881:17:16:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:health events) rather than idiosyncratic income risk.  As a result their model features only
8:296:22973:16:17:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one individual state variable and many results can be derived in closed form.  The tradeoff
8:297:23064:17:17:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is that their theory is further from the standard Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model that forms
8:298:23154:17:20:72:338:516:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:the backbone of much of modern macroeconomics.16
8:299:23202:20:16:89:540:496:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Section1 lays out our continuous-time version of the workhorse macroeconomic model
8:300:23284:16:17:72:539:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of income and wealth distribution in the parsimonious form due toHuggett(1993).  Section
8:301:23372:17:17:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2 contains our new theoretical results.  Section3 describes our computational algorithm for
8:302:23463:17:17:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:both stationary and time-varying equilibria and discusses computational advantages relative
8:303:23554:17:17:72:539:429:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to  existing  discrete-time  methods.   Section4  demonstrates  the  algorithm’s  generality  by
8:304:23650:17:46:72:404:412:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:applying it to a number of other economies.  Section5 concludes.

8:307:23791:32:17:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:To  explain  the  logic  of  our  approach  in  the  simplest  possible  fashion,  we  present  it  in  a
8:308:23896:17:17:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:context that should be very familiar to many economists:  a general equilibrium model with
8:309:23986:17:16:72:539:275:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:incomplete  markets  and  uninsured  idiosyncratic  labor  income  risk  as  inAiyagari(1994),
8:310:24080:16:17:72:539:259:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Bewley(1986) andHuggett(1993).  We first do this in the context of an economy in which
8:311:24166:17:19:72:539:242:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:individuals save in unproductive bonds that are in fixed supply as inHuggett(1993).  We
8:312:24253:19:15:81:539:223:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:14Additionally, Bayer and W ̈alde study a version of the model with the “natural borrowing constraint”
8:313:24355:15:12:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:implying that  individuals never  actually hit  that  constraint.  Another difference  is that  they characterize
8:314:24468:12:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:individuals’  saving  behavior  in  terms  of  a  differential  equation  for  its  consumption  policy  function.   In
8:315:24587:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:contrast,  we  do  this  in  terms  of  the  HJB  equation  for  the  value  function,  thereby  allowing  us  to  take
8:316:24706:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:advantage of the theory of viscosity solutions.  Of course the two approaches are related and their equation
8:317:24814:12:8:72:429:160:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:for consumption can be derived from the envelope condition of the HJB equation.
8:318:24893:8:12:81:510:152:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:?:15Also Lise (2013) studies heterogeneous households in continuous time but in partial equilibrium.
8:319:24991:12:16:81:539:140:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:16Wang (2007) proposes an elegant continuous-time Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model that can be solved
8:320:25089:16:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:analytically but at the cost of making two non-standard assumptions on preferences:  that individuals have
8:321:25195:12:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:CARA  utility  and  that  current  discount  rates  are  increasing  in  past  consumption  (in  the  absence  of  the
8:322:25313:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:second assumption, CARA utility implies exploding wealth inequality and no stationary wealth distribution
8:323:25418:12:0:72:103:88:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:exists).

9:345:26523:16:17:72:539:335:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:chosen for simplicity and Section 4shows how the setup can be extended to more general

11:417:29907:20:17:89:539:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The reader may wonder why the borrowing constraint (3) does not feature in the HJB
11:418:29989:17:16:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equation (7).  The reason is that,  in our continuous-time formulation,  the borrowing con-
11:419:30080:16:17:72:539:449:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:straint  never  binds  in  the  interior  of  the  state  space,  i.e.   fora >aand  as  a  result  an
11:420:30182:17:17:72:539:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:undistorted  first-order  conditionu′(cj(a))  =v′j(a)  holds  everywhere.21Intuitively,  since
11:421:30276:17:17:72:539:415:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealthais a continuously moving state variable, if it is strictly above the borrowing con-
11:422:30366:17:17:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:straint today, it will still be strictly above the constraint an infinitesimal time interval later.
11:423:30465:17:30:72:510:381:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:Instead, the borrowing constraint gives rise to astate constraint boundary condition22
11:424:30551:30:31:228:539:351:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:A:v′j(a)≥u′(yj+ra),  j= 1,2.(10)
11:425:30581:31:17:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:To see why this is the appropriate boundary condition, note that the first-order condition
11:426:30671:17:16:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:u′(cj(a)) =v′j(a) still holds ata=a.  The boundary condition (10) therefore impliessj(a) =
11:427:30761:16:19:72:539:287:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:yj+ra−cj(a)≥0, i.e.  it ensures that the borrowing constraint is never violated.  Online
11:428:30849:19:16:81:539:268:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:20A more compact way of writing this is to define theHamiltonianH(p) = maxcu(c)−pcand to write
11:429:30943:16:12:72:539:252:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the saving policy function assj(a) =yj+ra+H′(v′j(a)).  The HJB and KF equations (7) and (8) can then
11:430:31043:12:12:72:539:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:be expressed as two non-linear partial differential equations invjandgjonly, that do not involve a max

11:437:31257:35:15:81:539:150:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:21This is in contrast to discrete-time formulations where there is a set [a,a∗) witha∗>asuch that type
11:438:31359:15:9:72:489:135:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:1’s borrowing constraint binds for alla∈[a,a∗) and hence the first-order condition is distorted.
11:439:31455:9:15:81:539:126:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:22Note that this inequality has very little to do with the inequality in discrete-time first-order conditions
11:440:31564:15:12:71:539:111:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:due to occasionally binding borrowing constraints – see e.g.  equation (47) later in the paper.  In fact, the two
11:441:31677:12:12:71:539:99:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:inequalities go in opposite directions.  Even though both inequalities result from the presence of borrowing
11:442:31785:12:0:71:322:87:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:constraints, the logic behind them is completely different.

13:493:34780:16:17:71:539:450:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of our economy.  This “Mean Field Game” has two properties that are worth emphasizing.
13:494:34866:17:17:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:First, the two equations (12) and (13) are coupled: on one hand, an individual’s consumption-
13:495:34959:17:17:71:539:416:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:saving decision depends on the evolution of the interest rate which is in turn determined by
13:496:35051:17:17:71:539:399:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the evolution of the distribution; on the other hand, the evolution of the distribution depends
13:497:35146:17:16:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on  individuals’  saving  decisions.   Second,  the  two  equations  run  in  opposite  directions  in
13:498:35248:16:17:71:540:366:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f10:B:time:  the Kolmogorov Forward equationruns forward(as indicated by its name) andlooks

13:502:35597:16:17:71:539:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the question “given an individual’s valuation of income and wealth tomorrow, how much will

13:505:35816:28:16:71:539:214:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:A classical solution to a PDE or ODE is a solution that is differentiable as many times as
13:506:35906:16:17:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:needed to satisfy the corresponding equation.  In particular, classical solutions to the first-
13:507:36001:17:17:71:539:181:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:order HJB and KF equations (12) and (13) would need to be once differentiable.  Similarly,
13:508:36091:17:17:71:539:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:classical solutions to second-order equations that arise for example ifyfollows a diffusion
13:509:36182:17:16:71:539:147:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:process as in Section4.1would need to be twice differentiable.  In general, we do not expect
13:510:36274:16:17:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to  find  such  classical  solutions  to  either  HJB  or  KF  equations.   For  instance,  the  value
13:511:36376:17:17:71:540:114:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:functionvjmay have kinks and the distributiongjmay feature Dirac point masses.  Instead,
13:512:36464:17:17:71:539:97:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we generally look for certainweak  solutionsof these equations, that is solutions that may
13:513:36554:17:0:71:539:80:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not be continuously differentiable or even continuous but still satisfy these equations in some
14:514:36651:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sense.  As we explain in more detail in Online AppendixC, the correct notion for a weak

15:554:39301:17:17:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from  that  of  rich  individuals.   Whether  this  is  the  case  depends  crucially  on  two  factors:
15:555:39405:17:16:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the tightness of the borrowing constrainta, and the properties of the utility function at low

15:564:39755:37:17:72:539:431:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:For any utility function, a sufficient condition for Assumption1 is that the borrowing con-
15:565:39846:17:17:72:539:414:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:straint is tighter than the “natural borrowing constraint”a >−y1/r.  For example,  with
15:566:39933:17:17:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:CRRA utility (5) we haveR=γ/(y1+ra) which is finite whenevera >−y1/r.  However,
15:567:40012:17:17:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Assumption 1 is considerably weaker than this.  In particular, it is also satisfied if the bor-
15:568:40107:17:16:72:539:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rowing  constraint  equals  the  natural  borrowing  constrainta=−y1/rand  the  coefficient

15:570:40289:17:17:72:539:330:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:example the case with exponential utility (6) in which caseR=θ <∞regardless of the
15:571:40371:17:17:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tightness of the borrowing constraint.  The only case in which Assumption 1 is not satisfied
15:572:40463:17:16:72:539:296:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is ifboth(i) the borrowing constraint equals the natural borrowing constraintand(ii) risk

19:720:46817:17:17:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealth decline.  If both consumption and wealth declined at the same speed, then consump-
19:721:46906:17:17:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tion would be a linear function of wealth.  But this is not the case:  instead, wealth declines
19:722:47001:17:16:72:539:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:more rapidly than consumption – quadratically rather than linearly – see Figures2(a) and
19:723:47089:16:17:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(c).  Therefore, consumption is a strictly concave function of wealth.  Given this logic, it is
19:724:47184:17:17:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:then also clear that the consumption policy function must be more concave the higher is the

20:801:50936:16:17:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:policy functions are asymptotically linear for large wealth.  The proof makes use of a simple
20:802:51029:17:17:72:539:171:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:homogeneity  property:  it  shows  that,  for  allξ >0,  the  value  functionvexpressed  as  a

20:804:51210:17:16:71:540:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealtha, besides scaling everything by a factor 21−γ, effectively halves incomey.  Therefore,
20:805:51303:16:17:71:539:121:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as wealth becomes large, it is as if the individual had no labor income.  And it is well-known
20:806:51397:17:17:71:539:104:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that the consumption-saving problem with CRRA and without labor income has an analytic

21:809:51625:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:without income risk.  Assume that individuals have CRRA utility, (5) a deterministic stream

22:911:54992:17:17:72:539:353:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:propensity to consume (35) is strictly decreasing in wealtha;  that is, consumption over a

22:914:55272:17:17:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:intuition for the last two properties is the same as that discussed in Section2.2:  because
22:915:55363:17:17:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealth declines toward the borrowing constraint faster than consumption, the mapping from

25:1058:62001:16:17:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:getting stuck at the constraint is less likely).  Similarly, MPCs tend to be higher the higher

25:1064:62508:17:16:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:number of insights about properties of the stationary wealth distribution, particularly at the

25:1067:62735:17:17:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:fore present it in the main text.  Summing the KF equation (8) for the two income types,

28:1248:68624:17:17:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:exactly at the borrowing constrainta, the wealth distribution is smooth for alla >a.  This is
28:1249:68717:17:17:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:true even though income follows a process with discrete states (a two-state Poisson process).
28:1250:68810:17:16:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In  contrast,  the  wealth  distribution  in  discrete-time  versions  of  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett
28:1251:68908:16:17:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:models with discrete-state income processes, tends to feature “spikes” on the interior of the
28:1252:69001:17:20:72:472:312:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:state space.  See for example Figure 17.7.1 inLjungqvist and Sargent(2004).32
28:1253:69078:20:17:89:539:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Part  4  characterizes  the  wealth  distribution  for  intermediate  wealth  levels.   It  shows
28:1254:69175:17:17:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that  the  shapes  ofg1andg2in  Figure6  are  not  simply  due  to  a  particular  numerical
28:1255:69267:17:16:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:example.   Instead  both  density  functions  are  simple  ratios  of  well-understood  functions
28:1256:69364:16:17:71:540:242:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:gj(a) =κjf(a)/sj(a) wherefis defined in the Proposition and hump-shaped.  For instance
28:1257:69450:17:17:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:considerg1asaincreases: as in Figure6,g1tends to be first decreasing, then increasing again
28:1258:69541:17:17:71:539:208:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and finally decreasing.  Similarly, considerg2asaincreases:  it tends to be first increasing
28:1259:69633:17:18:71:377:191:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and then decreasing (hump-shaped), again as in the Figure.
28:1260:69691:18:16:81:539:173:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:32To see why this must happen in discrete time, consider a discrete-time Huggett economy with two income
28:1261:69795:16:12:72:539:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:states.  All individuals with wealtha=awho get the high income draw choose the same wealth levela′>a.
28:1262:69896:12:12:72:538:145:10:g_d0_f9:7:g_d0_f19:F:So if there is a Dirac mass ata, there must also be a Dirac mass ata′.  But all individuals with wealtha′
28:1263:70001:12:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:who get the high income draw, also choose the same wealth levela′′.  So there must also be a Dirac mass
28:1264:70104:12:11:72:539:121:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:ata′′> a′.   And  so  on.   Through  this  mechanism  the  Dirac  mass  at  the  borrowing  constraint  “spreads
28:1265:70216:11:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:into  the  rest  of  the  state  space.”  In  continuous  time  this  does  not  happen  because  individuals  leave  the
28:1266:70337:12:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:borrowing constraint in a smooth fashion (here according to a Poisson process, i.e.  a process with a random
28:1267:70445:12:0:72:258:86:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and continuously distributed arrival time).
29:1268:70490:0:16:89:539:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Part 5 characterizes the joint distribution of income and wealth.  The fraction of high
29:1269:70577:16:17:72:539:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:income types conditional on wealth Pr(y2|a) depends only on the saving ratess1ands2but,
29:1270:70664:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:perhaps surprisingly and in contrast to the fraction of high income types in the population
29:1271:70755:17:36:72:440:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Pr(y2) =λ1λ1+λ2, it does not depend directly on the intensitiesλ1andλ2.
29:1272:70826:36:17:72:539:634:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:B:Our Two Special Cases Again.We now briefly return to part 1 of Proposition3 and

29:1324:72259:17:17:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:seen clearly in their derivations,  the difference between (43) and (44) is solely due to the
29:1325:72352:17:17:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:saving behavior (linearity versus unbounded derivative ata= 0) which determines whether

29:1331:72841:12:0:71:373:80:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:types above, it is instead more convenient to work with the densities.

30:1359:74655:17:16:72:539:341:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the right.  Aggregate savingS(r) as a function of the interest ratertypically looks like in

30:1363:75032:17:16:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equilibrium can be proved with a graphical argument due toAiyagari(1994) that is also the
30:1364:75121:16:30:72:491:258:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foundation for a number of existence results in the literature (e.g.Acikgoz,2016).

30:1368:75451:29:17:72:539:165:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The logic behind the proof is simple.  One can show that the functionS(r) defined in (11)
30:1369:75540:17:19:72:540:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is continuous.  To guarantee that there is at least onersuch thatS(r) =B, it then suffices
30:1370:75630:19:15:81:539:129:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:35An increase inλhas two offsetting effects:  on one hand, individuals approach the borrowing constraint
30:1371:75734:15:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:faster (ν), thereby increasingm; on the other hand, individuals are more likely to die before they reach the

33:1471:79457:17:17:72:539:650:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:B:without solving them.  Since this method may be useful in other applications, we explain it
33:1472:79548:17:16:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:briefly in the context of the simple example without income uncertainty (41).  The key idea
33:1473:79639:16:17:72:539:617:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is to derive an equation forf(a) :=∂G(a)∂rand to prove thatf(a)<0 for alla∈(0,amax).
33:1474:79723:17:17:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Differentiating  (41)  with  respect  torwe  have  0  =−∂s(a)∂rg(a)−s(a)f′(a)−λf(a)  with
33:1475:79812:17:17:72:539:583:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:f(amax) = 0.  Next and to obtain a contradiction, suppose thatf(a)≥0 for somea.  Since
33:1476:79898:17:16:72:539:566:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:f(amax)  =  0  and  iff(0)  =  0,37fhas  to  attain  a  maximum  at  some  interiora∗at  which
33:1477:79992:16:0:72:351:550:12:g_d0_f12:8:g_d0_f14:C:f(a∗)≥0 andf′(a∗)  = 0.  Thereforeλf(a∗)  =−∂s(a
33:1478:80040:0:13:351:359:558:6:g_d0_f55:8:g_d0_f7:A:∗)
33:1479:80042:13:0:342:377:545:8:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f12:A:∂rg(a
33:1480:80047:0:21:377:539:554:8:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f6:A:∗)<0 but this contradicts the
33:1481:80076:21:17:72:539:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:assumption thatf(a∗)≥0 and hence proves the result.  Again, the method is considerably
33:1482:80162:17:20:72:141:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:more general.
33:1483:80175:20:16:89:539:496:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Finally, first-order stochastic dominance of the wealth distribution immediately implies
33:1484:80263:16:17:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that aggregate asset supply is increasing in the interest rate and hence uniqueness of the

33:1487:80442:27:17:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Empirical wealth distributions typically have the following properties:  there are individuals
33:1488:80536:17:17:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with both positive and negative net worth but there is a spike at close to zero net worth.
33:1489:80626:17:17:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This  empirical  observation  does  not  square  well  with the  Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model
33:1490:80720:17:16:72:539:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we have considered thus far.  If we set the borrowing constraint toa= 0, we get the spike
33:1491:80809:16:17:72:539:328:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:at zero but there are no individuals with negative net worth; if we seta <0, we get a spike
33:1492:80900:17:17:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:at a strictly negative wealth level.  Both are counterfactual.  A simple way of generating the
33:1493:80994:17:17:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:empirical observation just mentioned is to model a “soft” borrowing constraint as opposed
33:1494:81083:17:16:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to  the  “hard”  constraint  (3),  that  is,  a  wedge  between  borrowing  and  saving  rates.   This
33:1495:81185:16:17:72:539:261:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:form of constraint is used in a number of recent papers includingAlonso(2016) andKaplan,
33:1496:81273:17:17:72:539:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Moll, and Violante(2016).  In this section, we provide the first theoretical characterization
33:1497:81366:17:20:72:249:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of such soft borrowing constraints.
33:1498:81401:20:17:89:539:207:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Consider  the  Huggett  model  from  Section1  with  one  modification:  there  is  a  wedge
33:1499:81493:17:42:72:516:190:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between borrowing and lending rates.  That is, we replace the budget constraint (2) by

33:1509:81744:8:12:89:539:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Acikgoz (2016) provides a numerical example of multiple steady states in an Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett

34:1511:81948:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We show below that, in order to obtain a stationary wealth distribution with a spike at zero

34:1513:82130:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:types.  In particular, the simplest extension of the model that yields the desired result is to
34:1514:82225:17:20:72:393:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:have three income types i.e.yt∈{y0,y1,y2}withy0< y1< y2.

34:1516:82369:17:16:72:540:633:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:To avoid the somewhat cluttered notation resulting from considering three income types, it

35:1582:84693:34:17:89:539:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Of course with only one income type, the stationary wealth distribution will only be a

35:1584:84867:16:17:72:539:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with some mass either to the left (a <0) or to the right (a >0)but not both.  Therefore to

35:1586:85050:17:17:72:539:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the right of zero it is necessary to introduce (at least) another income type.  Figure9(a) plots
35:1587:85146:17:16:72:539:384:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the saving policy functions in such a version with three income typesy0< y1< y2.  Figure
35:1588:85234:16:17:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:9(b) plots the resulting wealth densitiesg0,g1andg2.  The unconditional wealth distribution
35:1589:85325:17:17:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is the sum of these three densities.  As expected, it has a spike at zero and mass both to the
35:1590:85419:17:46:72:163:334:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:left and the right.
35:1591:85438:46:32:72:213:288:17:g_d0_f5:17:g_d0_f5:C:3    Computation
35:1592:85454:32:17:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We now describe our algorithm for numerically computing equilibria of continuous-time het-
35:1593:85544:17:17:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:erogeneous agent models.  We use a finite difference method based on work byAchdou and
35:1594:85630:17:16:72:539:222:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Capuzzo-Dolcetta(2010) andAchdou(2013) which is simple, efficient and easily extended
35:1595:85715:16:17:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to other environments.  We explain our method in the context of the baseline heterogeneous
35:1596:85805:17:17:72:539:189:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:agent  model  of  Section1.   But  the  algorithm  is,  in  fact,  considerably  more  general  and
35:1597:85904:17:17:72:539:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:applies toanyheterogeneous agent model with a continuum of atomistic agents (and with-
35:1598:85990:17:16:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:out aggregate shocks).  It is particularly well-suited for computing transition dynamics and
35:1599:86082:16:17:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:solving problems with non-convexities, a fact we illustrate in Section4 by computing equi-
35:1600:86172:17:17:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:libria of such economies.  Codes for these applications (and many more) are available from

36:1604:86409:27:17:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Before explaining our algorithm, we provide a brief overview of some of its computational
36:1605:86498:17:17:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:advantages relative to traditional discrete-time methods.  We here list four computational
36:1606:86588:17:17:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:advantages that we consider crucial and that contribute notably to the efficiency gains over
36:1607:86680:17:16:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:traditional methods.  The first of these advantages is special to the solution of problems with
36:1608:86775:16:17:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:borrowing constraints.  The second to fourth advantages concern the solution of heteroge-
36:1609:86864:17:20:72:450:609:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:neous agent models more broadly (e.g.  models with heterogeneous firms).
36:1610:86936:20:17:89:541:589:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:To appreciate the first two advantages, contrast the first-order condition of the continuous-
36:1611:87029:17:16:72:540:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time income fluctuation problem (7) with that in the analogous discrete-time problem.  For
36:1612:87119:16:31:72:449:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:concreteness also assume CRRA utility (5) so that the two conditions are

36:1618:87288:39:17:72:539:456:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in discrete time,  where 0< β <1 is a discount factor andπjk= Pr(y′=yk|y=yj) are
36:1619:87368:17:17:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the entries of the Markov transition matrix for the analogous discrete-time income process.
36:1620:87459:17:17:72:539:422:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The first advantage of our continuous-time approach is that, as explained in Section1.2, the
36:1621:87551:17:17:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:borrowing constraint (3) only shows up in the boundary condition (10) and therefore the
36:1622:87638:17:16:72:539:388:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:first-order condition (46) holdswith  equalityeverywhere in the interior of the state space.
36:1623:87730:16:17:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In contrast, the discrete-time first-order condition (47) holds with complementary slackness
36:1624:87822:17:17:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and therefore is aninequality.  This is because the borrowing constraint may bind one time
36:1625:87912:17:17:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:period  ahead.   Continuous  time  allows  us  to  completely  sidestep  any  technical  difficulties
36:1626:88013:17:19:72:339:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:arising due to such occasionally binding constraints.
36:1627:88066:19:17:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Second and related, the first-order condition in (46) is “static” in the sense that it only
36:1628:88157:17:17:72:539:285:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:involves  contemporaneous  variables.   Given  (a  guess  for)  the  value  functionvj(a)  it  can
36:1629:88255:17:17:72:539:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be  solved  by  hand:cj(a)  =  (v′j(a))−1/γ,j=  1,2.   In  contrast,  the  discrete-time  condition
36:1630:88354:17:16:72:539:251:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(47) defines the optimal choiceonly  implicitly.  Typical solution methods therefore employ
36:1631:88445:16:17:72:538:235:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:costly root-finding operations. Our continuous-time approach again sidesteps this difficulty.40
36:1632:88540:17:17:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Intuitively, discrete time distinguishes between “today” and “tomorrow” but in continuous
36:1633:88629:17:20:72:230:201:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:time, “tomorrow”is“today.”41
36:1634:88657:20:17:89:539:181:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The third advantage of continuous time is a form of “sparsity.” To solve the HJB and
36:1635:88741:17:18:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:KF equations (7) and (8), we discretize these so that their solution boils down to solving
36:1636:88831:18:16:81:539:146:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:40In this regard,  it shares some similarities with the “endogenous grid method” ofCarroll(2006).  The
36:1637:88933:16:8:72:404:130:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:difference is that in continuous time this also works with “exogenous grids.”
36:1638:89010:8:16:81:539:122:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:41Related, (46) also does not involve an expectation operator as in (47) that makes it necessary to calculate
36:1639:89119:16:11:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:a summation over future income states or a costly numerical integral (in the context of more general income
36:1640:89226:11:12:72:539:95:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:processes).   Instead  the  HJB  equation  (7)  captures  the  evolution  of  the  stochastic  process  forytwith  an
36:1641:89343:12:0:72:417:83:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:additive termsλj(v−j(a)−vj(a)) that does not affect the first-order condition.
37:1642:89423:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:systems of linear equations.  The resulting matrices are typically extremely sparse, namely
37:1643:89514:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“tridiagonal” or at least “block-tridiagonal.” This sparsity generates considerable efficiency
37:1644:89608:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:gains  because  there  are  well-developed  routines  for  solving  sparse  linear  systems,  either
37:1645:89708:17:17:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:implemented as part of commercial software packages like Matlab or open-source libraries
37:1646:89796:17:17:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:like SuiteSparse.  The reason that tridiagonal matrices arise is that a discretized continuous-
37:1647:89891:17:16:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time process either stays at the current grid point, takes one step to the left or one step to
37:1648:89985:16:20:72:233:620:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:the right.  But it never jumps.42
37:1649:90018:20:17:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Fourth, in all heterogeneous agent models, there is a tight link between solving the HJB
37:1650:90106:17:17:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and  KF  equations.   One  can  typically  “kill  two  birds  with  one  stone”  in  the  sense  that,
37:1651:90208:17:16:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:having computed the solution to the HJB equation one gets the solution to the KF equation
37:1652:90297:16:17:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“for free”:  the matrix in the discretized version of the latter is the transpose of the matrix
37:1653:90392:17:17:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in that of the former.  The underlying mathematical reason is that the KF equation is the
37:1654:90481:17:17:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“transpose problem” of the HJB equation or, more precisely, that the differential operator
37:1655:90571:17:40:72:442:499:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:in the KF equation is the adjoint of the operator in the HJB equation.43

37:1657:90704:27:17:72:539:432:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f12:B:Our  aim  is  to  calculate  stationary  equilibria  –  functionsv1,v2andg1,g2and  a  scalarr
37:1658:90797:17:17:72:539:415:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:satisfying  (7),  (8)  and  (11)  –  given  a  specified  functionu,  and  values  for  the  parameters

37:1660:90988:16:17:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:algorithm in detail, we provide a bird’s eye view of the algorithm’s general structure.  We
37:1661:91079:17:17:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:focus on two distinct challenges.  First, the HJB and KF equations describing a stationary
37:1662:91169:17:17:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equilibrium are coupled and one therefore has to iterate on them somehow.  Second, solving
37:1663:91259:17:35:72:517:331:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:these differential equations requires approximating the value function and distribution.
37:1664:91347:35:17:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:B:Iterating on the Equilibrium SystemFrom a bird’s eye perspective our algorithm for
37:1665:91429:17:17:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:solving the stationary equilibrium shares many similarities with algorithms typically used
37:1666:91519:17:17:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to solve discrete-time heterogeneous agent models.  In the context of our Huggett economy,
37:1667:91609:17:17:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we use a bisection algorithm on the stationary interest rate.  We begin an iteration with an
37:1668:91701:17:25:72:318:228:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:initial guessr0.  Then for`= 0,1,2,...we follow
37:1669:91748:25:17:86:540:203:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:1.  Givenr`, solve the HJB equation (7) using a finite difference method.  Calculate the
37:1670:91836:17:18:101:246:186:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:saving policy functions`j(a).
37:1671:91865:18:16:81:539:168:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:42Except of course if the process is a Poisson process, i.e.  if jumps are “built in.” That being said, the
37:1672:91972:16:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:sparsity property survives as long as there is at least one continuously moving state variable (like wealth),
37:1673:92081:12:8:72:402:140:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:i.e.  not all individual state variables follow discrete-state Poisson processes.
37:1674:92162:8:16:81:539:132:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:43In principle, one can use an analogous approach in discrete time: form the endogenous Markov transition
37:1675:92267:16:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:matrix between states and use it both to iterate backward over value functions (or Euler equations) and to
37:1676:92373:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:iterate forward over distributions.  This method does not appear to be very popular and researchers typically
37:1677:92482:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:use Monte-Carlo simulation to solve for the distribution.  A possible reason is that transition matrices are
37:1678:92590:12:0:72:343:80:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:not (or less) sparse resulting in a less dramatic efficiency gain.

38:1695:93492:17:17:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We  explain  our  approach  –  a  finite  difference  method  –  in  more  detail  in  the  next  two
38:1696:93593:17:17:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:subsections.  But a brief sketch is as follows.  In a nutshell, the key idea is that this finite
38:1697:93689:17:16:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:difference  method  transforms  our  system  of  differential  equations  into  a  system  of  sparse
38:1698:93790:16:17:72:539:460:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matrix equations.  With this goal in mind, we approximate bothv1,v2andg1,g2atIdiscrete

38:1703:94231:17:31:72:348:376:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:will then be the following system of matrix equations:

38:1707:94334:31:17:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The first equation is the discretized HJB equation (7), the second equation is the discretized

38:1713:94878:17:16:72:539:174:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:HJB equation.  As already noted, (48) to (50) is simply a system of sparse matrix equations
38:1714:94969:16:17:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that can be easily solved on a computer by following (the analogues of) Steps 1 to 3 described

39:1720:95374:17:17:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we explain our approach we should note that there is a well-developed theory concerning
39:1721:95461:17:17:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the numerical solution of HJB equations using finite difference schemes in the same way as
39:1722:95551:17:17:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:there is a well-developed theory concerning the numerical solution of discrete-time Bellman
39:1723:95642:17:16:72:539:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equations.   The  key  result  is  due  to  Barles  and  Souganidis(1991)  who  have  proven  that,
39:1724:95741:16:17:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:under certain conditions, the solution to a finite difference scheme converges to the (unique

39:1727:96016:17:16:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:short, for their result to hold, the finite difference scheme needs to satisfy three conditions: (i)
39:1728:96116:16:17:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“monotonicity”, (ii) “stability” and (iii) “consistency.” These are spelled out in the Online
39:1729:96209:17:17:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Appendix.   Here  it  suffices  to  note  that  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  typically  easy  to  satisfy  and,  in
39:1730:96318:17:17:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:practice, the main difficulty for the numerical solution of HJB equations is to design a finite
39:1731:96413:17:36:72:401:438:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:difference scheme that satisfies (iii), the monotonicity condition.
39:1732:96480:36:17:72:539:402:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:B:Finite Difference MethodWe here explain the finite difference method for solving the
39:1733:96564:17:17:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:stationary HJB equation for a special case we have already examined earlier in the paper,
39:1734:96653:17:17:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:namely the one with no income uncertaintyy1=y2=y.  The generalization to income risk
39:1735:96737:17:30:72:377:351:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is straightforward.  The HJB equation in this special case is
39:1736:96798:30:7:208:273:321:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:A:ρv(a) = max

39:1739:96834:31:17:72:539:290:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:As already mentioned, the finite difference method approximates the functionvatIdiscrete

39:1741:97008:16:17:72:539:257:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:distance between grid points, and use the short-hand notationvi:=v(ai).  The derivative

40:1754:97542:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:approximations is used and where in the state space is extremely important.  The reason
40:1755:97629:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is  that  this  choice  determines  whether  Barles  and  Souganidis’  monotonicity  condition  is
40:1756:97727:17:36:72:116:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:satisfied.
40:1757:97737:36:17:72:539:634:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:B:UpwindingAs just mentioned, it is important whether and when a forward or a backward
40:1758:97821:17:17:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:difference  approximation is  used.  The ideal solution  to this problem  is to use  a so-called
40:1759:97917:17:17:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“upwind scheme.” The rough idea is to use a forward difference approximation whenever the
40:1760:98006:17:16:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:drift of the state variable (here, savingsi=y+rai−ci) is positive and to use a backward
40:1761:98093:16:17:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:difference whenever it is negative.  This is intuitive:  if saving is positive,  what matters is
40:1762:98189:17:17:71:539:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:how the value function changes when wealth increases by a small amount;  and vice versa
40:1763:98276:17:17:71:539:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:when saving is negative.  The right thing to do is therefore to approximate the derivative in
40:1764:98369:17:16:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the direction of the movement of the state.  To this end use the notations+i= max{si,0},
40:1765:98457:16:17:71:539:500:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:i.e.s+iis “the positive part ofsi” and analogouslys−i= min{si,0}.  The upwind version of
40:1766:98545:17:19:71:130:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(52) is then

40:1776:98793:17:17:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:issues.  First, that the HJB equation (51) is highly non-linear due to the presence of the max
40:1777:98887:17:17:71:539:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:operator, and therefore so is its finite difference approximation (53).  It therefore has to be
40:1778:98982:17:16:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:solved using an iterative scheme and one faces a choice between using so-called “explicit”
40:1779:99072:16:17:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f14:B:and  “implicit”  schemes.   Related,  from  the  first-order  conditionci=  (u′)−1(v′i),  savingsi
40:1780:99170:17:17:72:539:337:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and consumptioncithemselves depend on whether the forward or backward approximation
40:1781:99253:17:17:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is used so (53) has a circular element to it.  The solution to both these issues is described in
40:1782:99349:17:19:72:229:303:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:detail in the Online Appendix.
40:1783:99379:19:17:89:539:284:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The upwind finite difference scheme for the HJB equation (53) can be conveniently written
40:1784:99468:17:17:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in matrix notation.  Denoting byv= (v1,...,vI)Tthe vector collecting the value function at

40:1803:100417:17:17:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the properties that a Poisson transition matrix needs to satisfy.  For these reasons we will
40:1804:100509:17:0:72:539:80:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sometimes refer toA(v;r) as “Poisson transition matrix” or “intensity matrix.” All this will
41:1805:100603:0:36:72:411:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be useful in Section3.4below when we solve the KF equation (8).

41:1808:100835:17:17:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:has an additional great advantage:  the handling of boundary conditions.  First, consider the
41:1809:100928:17:16:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:upper end of the state spaceaI.  If this upper end is large enough, saving will be negative
41:1810:101019:16:17:72:539:617:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:B:sI<0 so thats+I= 0.45It can then be seen from (53) that the forward difference is never
41:1811:101106:17:17:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:used at the upper end of the state space.  As a result no boundary condition needs to be
41:1812:101194:17:17:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:imposed.  Next, consider the lower end of the state space and in particular the question how
41:1813:101286:17:16:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to impose the state constraint boundary condition (10) which holds with equality only when
41:1814:101376:16:17:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  constraint  binds.   To  impose  this,  we  can  exploit  the  special  structure  of  the  upwind
41:1815:101479:17:31:72:255:533:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:scheme:  set the boundary condition

41:1820:101794:17:17:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ary condition is only imposed if it would be the case thats1<0; but it is not used ifs1>0.
41:1821:101884:17:40:72:383:404:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This ensures that the borrowing constraint is never violated.

41:1823:102000:28:16:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:For step 2, consider the stationary Kolmogorov Forward equation (8).  We again discretize

41:1826:102292:17:17:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be  solved  in  one  iteration.   There  are  a  number  of  potentially  admissible  finite  difference
41:1827:102396:17:16:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:schemes,  but  one  of  these  is  particularly  convenient  and  deeply  rooted  in  mathematical
41:1828:102494:16:17:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:theory:  the discretization (49) which involves thetransposeofA(v,r), the transition matrix

41:1830:102639:20:17:89:539:216:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The  deep  underlying  reason  for  this  choice  of  discretization  is  that  the  KF  equation

41:1834:103019:19:15:81:539:147:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:45In fact, in the special case without uncertainty analyzed in the present section and under the assumption
41:1835:103126:15:12:72:539:132:10:g_d0_f17:10:g_d0_f9:F:r < ρ,  saving is negative everywhere in the state space.  The condition thataIneeds to be large enough
41:1836:103229:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:really only matters for the case with uncertainty.  That the case without uncertainty is special also applies
41:1837:103338:12:9:72:520:108:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:to the subsequent discussion:  without uncertainty the state constraint (10) always holds with equality.
41:1838:103442:9:15:81:539:99:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:46The “infinitesimal generator” is the continuous-time analogue of a discrete-time transition matrix, and
41:1839:103547:15:0:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the adjoint of an operator is the infinite-dimensional analogue of a matrix transpose.  In our context, the

42:1841:103745:16:20:72:500:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:equation, the solution of the Kolmogorov Forward equation is essentially “for free.”
42:1842:103829:20:17:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The same numerical method – building the matrixAand then working with its transpose
42:1843:103912:17:17:72:539:667:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:– can also be used when solving problems that involveonlythe KF equation, e.g.  because
42:1844:103999:17:17:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the  optimal  decision  rules  can  be  solved  for  analytically.   This  approach  is,  for  example,

42:1848:104348:17:17:71:539:580:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:show in AppendixDthat this is not the case.  First,  we show theoretically that the only
42:1849:104436:17:16:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:implication of the Dirac mass is that some care is required wheninterpretingthe output of

42:1853:104792:17:40:72:482:496:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that it performs extremely well in practice unless the wealth grid is very coarse.

43:1915:107345:28:16:72:539:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:All of Figures1,6 and8 for the Huggett economy in Section1 earlier in the paper were

44:1931:108741:21:27:108:200:699:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:C:ence Method
44:1932:108752:27:17:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Candler (1999) has previously used a finite difference method to solve HJB equations arising
44:1933:108844:17:17:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in economics (with the neoclassical growth model as his prime example) and also discusses
44:1934:108933:17:16:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:upwinding. Our numerical method adds to his in three dimensions. First and most obviously,
44:1935:109023:16:17:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we consider coupled HJB and KF equations rather than just the HJB equation in isolation:
44:1936:109111:17:17:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the system (7), (8) and (11) rather than just (7).  We show that there is a tight mapping
44:1937:109200:17:17:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between the KF equation and the HJB equation and that this mapping can be conveniently
44:1938:109286:17:16:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:exploited in finite difference schemes (the adjoint/transpose property discussed in Section
44:1939:109377:16:17:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:3.4).  Candler, in contrast, does not discuss Kolmogorov Forward equations.  Second, even
44:1940:109466:17:17:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:when considered in isolation, our HJB equation differs from Candler’s and this is reflected
44:1941:109557:17:17:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in  the  solution  method.   In  particular,  we  show  how  to  handle  borrowing  constraints  by
44:1942:109656:17:16:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mathematically casting them as state constraints (a step that requires using the notion of
44:1943:109746:16:17:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:viscosity solution) and designing an upwind method that respects these constraints.  Borrow-
44:1944:109838:17:17:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ing constraints are, of course, a ubiquitous feature of heterogeneous agent models.  Third,
44:1945:109929:17:17:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we show that our solution method has well-developed theoretical underpinnings by making
44:1946:110016:17:20:72:438:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the connection to theBarles and Souganidis(1991) convergence theory.
44:1947:110084:20:16:89:539:417:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Besides  the  finite  difference  method,  there  are  many  alternative  methods  for  solving
44:1948:110179:16:17:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partial differential  equations  in general  and  HJB  and  KF equations in particular.   Exam-
44:1949:110274:17:17:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ples include finite-element,  finite-volume,  semi-Lagrangean,  and Markov-chain approxima-
44:1950:110365:17:17:72:539:367:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tion methods as well as approximation via orthogonal (e.g.  Chebyshev) polynomials.49In
44:1951:110452:17:16:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:principle, these other methods can also be used to solve heterogeneous agent models of the
44:1952:110542:16:17:72:539:334:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:type discussed here; in particular by following the same Steps 1 to 3 laid out in Section3.2
44:1953:110634:17:20:72:434:317:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:but simply exchanging the solution method usedwithinSteps 1 and 2.
44:1954:110700:20:17:89:539:297:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:There  is  no  sense  in  which  the  finite  difference  method  laid  out  here  dominates  these
44:1955:110799:17:17:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other methods.  In fact, some of these other methods may even be more accurate for coarse
44:1956:110888:17:16:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:discretizations of the value function and distribution.  We nevertheless prefer it over other
44:1957:110981:16:17:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:methods  for  two  reasons.   First,  the  finite  difference  method  is  transparent  and  easy  to
44:1958:111082:17:17:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:implement.  In case the algorithm spits out junk, it is usually easy to track down the prob-
44:1959:111174:17:17:72:539:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:lem.  Second, and as explained in Section3.4, the finite difference method delivers a useful
44:1960:111266:17:16:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:symmetry in the solution methods for the HJB and KF equations (that the matrix in the
44:1961:111351:16:17:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:latter  is  the  transpose  of  that  in  the  former).   Other  methods  typically  do  not  have  this
44:1962:111455:17:18:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:property.  Finally, because the finite difference method is fast, choosing fine grids is usually
44:1963:111551:18:16:81:539:145:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:49Some of these methods have also been used in economics.  For example,Golosov and Lucas(2007) and
44:1964:111649:16:11:72:539:129:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Barczyk and Kredler(2014) use the Markov Chain approximation method ofKushner and Dupuis(2013).
44:1965:111744:11:12:71:539:118:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Because some of our paper’s readers have wondered about this in the past, we should emphasize that a finite
44:1966:111851:12:12:71:539:106:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:difference method is different from the Kushner-Dupuis method:  their approach essentially transforms the
44:1967:111956:12:0:71:520:94:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:continuous-time problem into a discrete-time problem and then solves it using value function iteration.
45:1968:112061:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not  costly  and  hence  it  is  not  a  concern  that  other  methods  may  be  more  accurate  with
45:1969:112162:16:47:72:183:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:coarse discretizations.

45:1973:112415:17:41:72:294:592:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:portability of our computational algorithm.

45:1975:112494:27:17:72:539:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Our baseline model assumed that incomeyttakes one of two values, high and low.  We now
45:1976:112580:17:17:72:539:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:extend many of our results to an environment with a continuum of productivity types.50In
45:1977:112668:17:16:72:539:490:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:particular, the computational algorithm laid out in Section3 carries over without change.
45:1978:112757:16:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This is true even though the system of equations describing an equilibrium will be a system
45:1979:112848:17:20:72:277:457:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of PDEs rather than a system of ODEs.
45:1980:112885:20:17:89:539:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As  in  Section1.1,  there  is  a  continuum  of  individuals  that  are  heterogeneous  in  their

45:1983:113155:17:17:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with a continuous diffusion process.  Individual income evolves stochastically over time on a

45:1998:114477:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:be easily analyzed.  Instead the motivation for this assumption is purely practical:  we ultimately solve the
45:1999:114586:12:9:72:503:112:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:problem numerically and any computations necessarily require income to lie in a bounded interval.

48:2117:120053:28:17:71:540:437:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:An important class of economic theories involves non-convexities as inSkiba(1978). Another

48:2121:120424:17:17:71:539:370:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:– hence the price in the constraint – and housing is indivisible – hence the non-convexity.

50:2213:126100:17:16:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the presence of kinks and therefore our computational algorithm can be applied without

52:2238:126785:0:16:72:540:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealth distributions.  Figures 11 (e) and (f) confirm this possibility:  they plot two possible
52:2239:126880:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:stationary wealth distributions.  In fact there is a continuum of stationary wealth distribu-
52:2240:126973:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tions.  In results not shown here due to space constraints, we have also computed the model’s
52:2241:127066:17:17:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transition dynamics.  Not surprisingly given the discussion thus far,  the economy features
52:2242:127157:17:17:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:history dependence in the sense that initial conditions determine where the economy ends
52:2243:127245:17:16:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:up in the long run.  As already noted, the point of this subsection is not to argue quantita-
52:2244:127338:16:17:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tively that the presence of indivisible housing and down-payment constraints creates history
52:2245:127430:17:41:72:513:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:dependence.  Rather it is to showcase the possibilities of our computational algorithm.
52:2246:127517:41:27:72:170:562:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:C:4.4    Fat Tails
52:2247:127533:27:17:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:As shown in Proposition3, the stationary wealth distribution in the Huggett economy with a
52:2248:127623:17:17:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:bounded income process is bounded above.  More generally, any income process with a thin-
52:2249:127712:17:16:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tailed  stationary  distribution  results  in  a  thin-tailed  wealth  distribution.55This  property
52:2250:127812:16:17:72:540:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of the model is,  of course,  problematic vis-`a-vis wealth distributions observed in the data
52:2251:127906:17:17:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which are typically heavily skewed and feature fat upper tails.  In Online AppendixE.2we
52:2252:127994:17:17:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:show how to extend the Huggett model of Section1 to feature a fat-tailed stationary wealth
52:2253:128084:17:17:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:distribution.  We do this by introducing a risky asset in addition to the riskless bond.  The
52:2254:128177:17:16:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:insight that the introduction of “investment risk” into a Bewley model generates a Pareto
52:2255:128266:16:17:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:tail for the wealth distribution is due toBenhabib, Bisin, and Zhu(2015) and our argument
52:2256:128355:17:41:72:499:384:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:mimics several of their steps.  Also seeJones(2015) andDe Nardi and Fella(2017).

52:2258:128479:27:17:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The  models  discussed  in  Sections4.3and4.4featured  two  assets:  bonds  and  housing  in
52:2259:128571:17:17:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the former;  bonds and a risky asset in the latter.  But in both cases portfolio adjustment
52:2260:128662:17:16:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between  the  two  assets  was  costless  and  we  could  therefore  collapse  the  two  assets  into
52:2261:128763:16:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one  state  variable,  net  worth.   Costless  portfolio  adjustment  may  be  a  bad  assumption
52:2262:128860:17:17:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in  many  applications.   For  instance,  buying  a  house  may  entail  both  fixed  and  variable
52:2263:128959:17:17:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transaction  costs.   The  same  is  true  for  illiquid  assets  more  generally.   For  example,  an
52:2264:129061:17:16:72:539:215:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:individual withdrawing funds from her retirement account typically incurs a penalty.Kaplan,
52:2265:129152:16:17:72:539:199:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Moll, and Violante(2016) show how to extend the computational algorithm developed here
52:2266:129238:17:17:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to  handle  multiple  assets  with  kinked  (but  convex)  adjustment  costs  and  argue  that  the
52:2267:129337:17:18:72:535:165:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:two-asset structure is important for understanding the monetary transmission mechanism.
52:2268:129424:18:15:81:539:147:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:55As discussed byBenhabib and Bisin(2016) the only exception to this is if income itself has a stationary
52:2269:129529:15:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:distribution with a fat (Pareto) tail.  However, this assumption would generate the counterfactual prediction
52:2270:129638:12:12:72:540:120:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:that the tail of the wealth distribution is equally fat as that of the income distribution.  In the data, instead,
52:2271:129752:12:0:72:432:108:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the wealth distribution has a considerably fatter tail than the income distribution.

53:2273:129867:27:17:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:In models with multiple assets like the one discussed above, one may want to allow for non-
53:2274:129958:17:17:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:convex adjustment costs, e.g. fixed costs. In work in progress we show how our algorithm also
53:2275:130051:17:17:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:generalizes to solve such problems.  Non-convex adjustment costs result in the individual’s
53:2276:130142:17:16:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:problem becoming a stopping time problem rather than a standard dynamic optimization
53:2277:130226:16:17:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:problem (Stokey, 2009).  The value function then no longer solves an HJB equation; instead
53:2278:130316:17:17:72:539:609:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:it solves a so-called “HJB Variational Inequality” (Øksendal,1995;Tourin,2013).56Nev-
53:2279:130401:17:17:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ertheless,  the  algorithm  developed  here  can  be  generalized  in  a  relatively  straightforward
53:2280:130502:17:16:71:540:575:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:manner  to  solve  these  type  of  stopping  time  problems.57The  computational  method  for
53:2281:130596:16:17:71:539:559:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:solving stopping time problems also promises to be useful in other applications, e.g.  prob-
53:2282:130688:17:17:71:540:542:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:lems  involving  default  by  individuals  (see  e.g.Livshits,  MacGee,  and  Tertilt,2007)  or  by
53:2283:130787:17:17:71:539:525:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sovereign states (see e.g.Aguiar, Amador, Farhi, and Gopinath,2013, for a continuous-time

53:2286:130904:32:17:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This  paper  makes  two  types  of  contributions.   First,  we  prove  a  number  of  new  theoreti-

53:2288:131092:16:17:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wealth distribution in macroeconomics:  (i) an analytic characterization of the consumption
53:2289:131183:17:17:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and saving behavior of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (ii) a
53:2290:131275:17:17:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (iii)
53:2291:131370:17:16:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of sub-
53:2292:131463:16:17:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:stitution is weakly greater than one; (iv) a characterization of “soft” borrowing constraints.
53:2293:131557:17:17:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Second, we develop a simple, efficient and portable algorithm for numerically solving both
53:2294:131647:17:17:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:stationary equilibria and transition dynamics of a wide class of heterogeneous agent models,
53:2295:131739:17:16:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:including – but not limited to – this model.  Both types of contributions were made possible
53:2296:131831:16:17:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by recasting the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model in continuous time, thereby transforming
53:2297:131918:17:18:72:361:246:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the model into a system of partial differential equations.
53:2298:131976:18:16:81:539:228:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:56Economists typically tackle these types of problems by splitting the state space into an inaction region
53:2299:132082:16:12:72:540:212:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and an adjustment region,  postulate that the value function satisfies an HJB equation in the adjustment
53:2300:132186:12:12:72:540:200:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:region and a “smooth pasting” condition on the boundary.  This approach is restrictive:  in one dimension,
53:2301:132292:12:11:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the boundary of the inaction region is just a threshold; but as soon as there is more than one state variable, it
53:2302:132405:11:12:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:becomes exceedingly hard to find the boundaries of the adjustment region.  The approach is even somewhat
53:2303:132509:12:12:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:misleading:   using  the  HJB  Variational  Inequality  formulation  the  smooth  pasting  condition  is  a  result
53:2304:132624:12:12:72:539:153:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:rather than an exogenously imposed axiom (Øksendal,1995).  Solving stopping time problems in multiple
53:2305:132725:12:9:71:423:141:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:dimensions then poses no conceptual problem over solving one-dimensional ones.

54:2310:133215:0:16:89:539:720:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:It  is  our  hope  that  the  methods  developed  in  this  paper,  particularly  the  numerical
54:2311:133311:16:17:72:540:704:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:algorithm, will also prove useful in other applications.  One potential application is to spatial
54:2312:133408:17:17:72:540:687:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:theories  of  trade  and  development  as  in  Rossi-Hansberg  (2005)  andAllen  and  Arkolakis
54:2313:133503:17:17:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(2014). These theories typically feature a continuum of producers and households distributed
54:2314:133595:17:17:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:over a continuum of locations.  In dynamic versions,  space would simply be an additional

54:2316:133772:16:17:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:prices which are typically functions of space rather than a small number of (potentially time-
54:2317:133866:17:17:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:varying) scalars.  Related, a second avenue for future research is to explore richer interactions
54:2318:133963:17:17:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between individuals.  In the class of theories we have considered here, individuals interact
54:2319:134055:17:16:72:540:569:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:only through prices. But for many questions of interest, richer interactions may be important:
54:2320:134149:16:17:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for instance there may be more “local” interactions in the form of knowledge spillovers or
54:2321:134239:17:17:72:539:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:diffusion (see e.g.Perla and Tonetti,2014;Lucas and Moll,2014;Burger, Lorz, and Wolfram,

54:2324:134502:17:42:72:287:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to encompass richer models such as these.
