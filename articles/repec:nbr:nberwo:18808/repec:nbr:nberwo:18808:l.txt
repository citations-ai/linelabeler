2:31:1710:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:The paper introduces a framework for studying the hierarchy of growth factors, from deep to more
2:32:1806:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:immediate. The specific setting we examine is 18th and 19th century Germany, when institutional
2:33:1901:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:changes introduced by reforms and transportation improvements converged to create city growth. We
2:34:1998:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:assess the impact of institutions on growth by allowing two ways for institutions to affect growth.
2:35:2097:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:Institutions can directly affect growth, or it can impact on trade, which in turn affects growth. Once
2:36:2199:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:we separately quantify the link from institutions to trade, and trade to growth, the independent effect
2:37:2302:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of institutions on growth is small. This suggests that part of what is often understood as trade’s effect
2:38:2407:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:on growth can be attributed to institutional change. It is straightforward to apply this framework to
2:39:2508:14:42:72:139:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:other settings.

3:58:2888:0:33:72:208:713:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:59:2903:33:22:72:553:680:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Re cent research on growth has begun to examine the deeper, fundamental causes of growth.
3:60:2992:22:22:72:554:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This has proved very productive because relative to proximate factors, the greater distance
3:61:3083:22:21:72:554:636:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between fundamental factors and economic growth allows for a more powerful causal analysis.
3:62:3174:21:22:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:At the same time, the relationship between the more proximate causes of growth and the deeper
3:63:3267:22:22:72:554:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:causes remains a bit of a puzzle. Do fundamental changes such as institutional reform a¤ect
3:64:3358:22:21:72:554:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the incentives to accumulate capital, to engage in trade, to adopt new technologies, or all of
3:65:3452:21:22:72:554:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:these things? To date we know little on how fundamentals exert their e¤ect on the causes, or
3:66:3544:22:27:72:236:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other manifestations, of growth.
3:67:3576:27:22:89:553:501:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As a result of the French Revolution, institutional changes were imposed upon certain ar-
3:68:3665:22:21:72:554:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:eas in Europe and in particular, a number of German areas experienced drastic improvements
3:69:3755:21:22:72:554:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in their economic institutions. Later, in the 19th century, parts of Germany saw major im-
3:70:3845:22:22:72:554:436:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:provements in interregional connections due to steam railways. A priori, deeper institutional
3:71:3938:22:21:72:554:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:changes and transportation improvements could have had independent e¤ects on city growth.
3:72:4027:21:22:72:554:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Alternatively, these e¤ects could be interdependent, in which case it would be important to be
3:73:4121:22:27:72:537:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:able to separately quantify the channels through which institutions impact on city growth.
3:74:4211:27:21:89:553:344:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We begin by showing that both institutions, as well as railways, a¤ect the proximate factor
3:75:4302:21:22:71:554:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that we focus on in this paper, namely, trade:T rade=T rade(Inst; Rail). Our measure of
3:76:4389:22:22:71:553:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade is based on spatial price gaps.  Since many factors have transactions cost aspects to
3:77:4480:22:21:71:553:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:them, price gaps reect the strength of integration between markets. We then link institutions
3:78:4574:21:22:71:554:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:via trade to growth:Growth=\f1T rade(Inst; Rail) +u.Central to the paper is that we
3:79:4657:22:22:72:554:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:separate the growth impact of institutions through trade from non-trade channels by including
3:80:4750:22:22:72:554:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:an independent institutions e¤ect:Growth=\f1T rade(Inst; Rail) +\f2Inst+u. The separate
3:81:4837:22:21:72:553:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:identication of\f1and\f2is possible because trade is not only a¤ected by institutions but
3:82:4927:21:22:72:553:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also by other transactions-cost reducing developments of the 19th century, in particular steam
3:83:5021:22:22:72:554:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railways. A key nding of the paper is that institutions a¤ect growth to a substantial degree
3:84:5114:22:26:72:219:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:through trade in this period.
3:85:5143:26:22:89:553:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Recent work has shown that institutions have a strong e¤ect on growth (Helpman 2004,
3:86:5227:22:0:72:554:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005a, La Porta et al.  2008 provide reviews).  We also
4:87:5315:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:know that institutions a¤ect trade (Greif 1993, Nunn 2007; review by Nunn and Treer 2013).
4:88:5406:21:22:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In addition, a few papers have established a signicant relationship between trade and growth
4:89:5499:22:22:72:554:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(Frankel and Romer 1999), in particular by showing that comparative advantage and the degree
4:90:5591:22:21:72:554:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of competition a¤ect growth (Young 1991, and Bloom, Draca, van Reenen 2011 respectively).
4:91:5680:21:22:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This paper provides a unifying framework by linking institutions, trade, and growth.  Our
4:92:5769:22:22:72:554:608:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:result says that in the setXofInst=> X=> Growth, trade is important. Arguably, this
4:93:5852:22:21:72:554:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:goes beyond a simple change of labels. Both to understand growth and to assess the early
4:94:5940:21:22:72:554:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¤ectiveness of policy, it is necessary to know the chain of events that institutional change sets
4:95:6038:22:28:72:125:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in motion.
4:96:6048:28:21:89:553:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:To the extent that trade gives rise to gains in welfare and income, one can view trade as
4:97:6137:21:22:71:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:operating at a level similar to other proximate factors, such as physical or human capital.1A
4:98:6230:22:22:71:553:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cou nter-perspective might be that trade is not so much a proximate cause of growth as an aspect
4:99:6326:22:21:72:554:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of institutions. In fact, much of the initial work on institutions was interested in capturing the
4:100:6424:21:22:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:impact of a broad cluster of institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001), whereas
4:101:6513:22:22:72:554:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:later work aimed at pinpointing a crucial subset of institutions (Djankov et al. 2003, Acemoglu
4:102:6608:22:21:72:554:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and Johnson 2005). If one thinks of trade as an aspect of institutions, then this paper can be
4:103:6702:21:28:72:426:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:viewed as a contribution to the literature on unbundling institutions.
4:104:6772:28:22:89:553:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As the placement of railways may have occurred non-randomly, we employ a measure of
4:105:6855:22:21:72:554:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railway costs, which varies with geographic features at the sub-state level, as an instrumental
4:106:6950:21:22:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variable.2Of course, geography can have direct e¤ects on trade and on growt h(Krugman and
4:107:7039:22:22:72:554:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Venables 1995), in which case it would not be a valid instrumental variable. Our relatively
4:108:7130:22:21:72:554:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:disaggregated data allows for richer identication strategies than can be applied with country-
4:109:7225:21:22:72:554:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:level data (Nunn 2009).3In addition, we can employ placebo checks since steam locomotives
4:110:7314:22:22:72:554:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:were not available in Germany for part of the sample period. The strategy will be successful
4:111:7406:22:27:72:554:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:if conditional on covariates railway costs a¤ected railway building during the later part of the

4:113:7607:15:9:71:470:142:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:have considered trade as a proximate factor (Rodrik, Subramaniam, and Trebbi 2004, 132).
4:114:7695:9:12:85:475:133:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:2Duo and Pande (2007) and Nunn and Puga (2012) also employ terrain in their studies.
4:115:7780:12:15:85:553:121:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:3Moreover, city size, our outcome variable, exhibits the same broad patterns as per capita GDP at the

4:117:7989:12:0:71:213:94:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:the macro level is not a concern.
5:118:8023:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:19th century. If, however, there is something correlated with railway costs that also switches
5:119:8117:22:21:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on  in the late 19th century, then identication fails. We perform a number of di¤erent analyses
5:120:8213:21:28:72:194:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to defend the approach.
5:121:8236:28:22:89:553:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Similarly, the challenge in estimating the impact of institutions on growth is that both may
5:122:8328:22:21:71:553:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:be driven by a third factor, or there is reverse causation. It is indeed rare that one can treat
5:123:8424:21:22:71:553:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions as exogenous. The shock of French rule to German institutions around 1800 was
5:124:8514:22:22:71:553:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:unusual in that it was plausibly exogenous, and similar to Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and
5:125:8604:22:21:71:553:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Robinson (2011; ACJR for short) we use it as our second instrumental variable. The Germans
5:126:8694:21:22:71:553:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:did not choose French institutions; rather, those institutions were imposed upon them. We rst
5:127:8788:22:22:71:553:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:use French rule and railway costs as instrumental variables to establish that institutions and
5:128:8882:22:21:71:553:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railways impact trade. In the next step we use French rule and railway costs as instrumental
5:129:8974:21:22:71:553:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables for showing that institutions a¤ect growth primarily through trade. Sections 4 and 5
5:130:9068:22:28:71:429:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:give a more detailed exposition that provide support for this strategy.
5:131:9139:28:21:89:553:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We are not the rst to distinguish fundamentals from proximate growth factors, and neither
5:132:9229:21:22:71:553:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are we the rst to examine the hierarchy of growth causes.4There is evidence, for example,
5:133:9319:22:22:72:554:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tha tProtestantism in 19th century Prussia raised income mostly because it led to human
5:134:9406:22:21:72:554:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:capital accumulation (Becker and Woessmann 2009). Also, Dell (2012) proposes ine¢cient land
5:135:9497:21:22:72:554:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reform as the mechanism why conict in early 20th century Mexico had negative economic
5:136:9583:22:22:72:554:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:consequences.  Identication is a central challenge in any study of the hierarchy of growth
5:137:9674:22:21:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:factors. Nineteenth century Germany provides a setting in which a causal growth analysis of
5:138:9765:21:28:72:341:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:fundamentals and proximate factors can be pursued.
5:139:9815:28:22:89:553:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The nding of a signicant role for railways in 19th century Germany ts well with recent
5:140:9904:22:21:72:554:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:studies on the impact of infrastructure projects (Michaels 2008, Duranton and Turner 2012),
5:141:9995:21:22:72:554:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:especially railways in history (Donaldson 2012, Donaldson and Hornbeck 2012, Hornung 2012).
5:142:10086:22:22:72:554:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The main di¤erence between our analysis and other infrastructure papers is that we include the
5:143:10180:22:21:72:554:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutional conditions that were behind railway building as the central element of the analysis.
5:144:10278:21:27:72:554:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We do this by applying the well-known two-sample instrumental variables approach developed
5:145:10368:27:16:85:553:109:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:4An i   nuential example is Rodrik, Subramaniam, and Trebbi (2004). Often the so-called mechanisms ques-
5:146:10473:16:12:72:554:93:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:tion concerns also the hierarchy of growth causes. In an earlier paper, we have studied a hierarchy of market
5:147:10582:12:0:72:227:81:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:size e¤ects (Keller and Shiue 2008).
6:148:10619:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:by Angrist and Krueger (1992). It allows us to employ rich bilateral data on prices and railway
6:149:10714:21:22:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:li nes by combining this information at the city-pair level with information on population size
6:150:10809:22:28:72:240:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and institutions at the city-level.
6:151:10844:28:21:89:553:645:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:It is likely that during this period, there were not only other fundamentals apart from the one
6:152:10939:21:22:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we investigateincluding geography (Diamond 1997, Sachs 2001), cultural environment (Clark
6:153:11029:22:22:72:554:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1987), or religion (Weber 1930)but other proximate factors as well besides trade. Although we
6:154:11123:22:21:72:554:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:do consider a broad range of alternative explanations in order to ensure that our fundamental
6:155:11216:21:22:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and proximate factors are both important to growth, our motive in this paper is not to rank the
6:156:11311:22:22:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:relative importance of one fundamental versus another, or one proximate factor versus another.
6:157:11405:22:21:72:554:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Rather, the contribution is to formulate and test a set of empirical implications on the role of
6:158:11501:21:28:72:269:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions for economic performance.
6:159:11539:28:22:89:553:466:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The paper is structured as follows. The following section gives the background necessary for
6:160:11631:22:21:72:554:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interpreting the results. Section 3 introduces the sample and discusses the main variables, with
6:161:11727:21:22:72:554:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:additional information given in Appendix A. In section 4 we estimate the impact of institutions
6:162:11822:22:22:72:554:401:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and railways on price gaps. Section 5 turns to the impact of institutions on growth, showing
6:163:11914:22:21:72:554:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that trade can be separated from other channels through which institutions may work. This
6:164:12003:21:22:72:554:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:section also introduces the two-sample approach of mapping city-pair to city observations,
6:165:12093:22:22:72:554:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and concludes with a discussion of the main ndings. More information on our two-sample
6:166:12180:22:21:72:554:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variables approach is found in Appendix B. A number of nal issues are raised in

6:170:12344:34:21:72:554:175:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Over much of the 19th century, a central feature of the region known as Germany today was
6:171:12433:21:22:72:554:154:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that despite centuries of shared language and culture, there were numerous independent states
6:172:12526:22:22:72:554:132:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that chose their own policies and institutions.  The 1848 borders of these states are shown
6:173:12617:22:21:72:554:110:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in Figure 1. Politically, the German states had shifting alliances, at times ghting wars on
6:174:12709:21:0:72:554:89:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:opposing sides. Economically, their institutions and policies di¤ered. Larger states such as
7:175:12802:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Prussia or Bavaria were geographically disjoint and cities in di¤erent parts of the same state
7:176:12896:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we re subject to di¤erent policies. This motivates why our analysis is at the sub-state level of
7:177:12992:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the city, rather than at the state level. The location of the sample cities is shown in Figure 2,
7:178:13089:22:28:72:374:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and their characteristics are discussed in section 3.2 below.
7:179:13150:28:21:89:553:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:This era a¤ords us with a mixture of common and idiosyncratic shocks that a¤ected German
7:180:13238:21:22:72:554:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economic development during the 19th century. Two of these stand out and are at the center of
7:181:13331:22:22:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:our analysis. First, there was change in the economic institutions governing these areas which
7:182:13425:22:21:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:was parallel to broader waves of political changes. The French Revolution in 1789 was the major
7:183:13520:21:22:72:554:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:source of new ideas that swept throughout Europe. In Germany it led to deep institutional
7:184:13609:22:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:change that varied across regions according to how strongly a particular region was a¤ected by
7:185:13703:22:21:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French rule. Although to some extent reversed during a period of restoration after 1815, the
7:186:13795:21:22:72:554:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French Revolution had a profound impact on German regional development throughout the
7:187:13880:22:22:72:554:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:19th century, which may have only been superseded by the political unication of Germany in
7:188:13971:22:21:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the year 1871. Our sample period ends soon after (in 1880), and it begins in the year 1820
7:189:14061:21:28:72:458:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:after the disruptive consequences of the Napoleonic armies had faded away.
7:190:14135:28:22:89:554:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, Germany experienced a transport revolution during the 19th century in the form
7:191:14221:22:21:72:554:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the rapid building of steam railways.  The introduction of railways was accompanied by
7:192:14310:21:22:72:554:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:widespread economic change in many countries (Fogel 1964, Donaldson 2012), and in Germany
7:193:14399:22:22:72:554:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:it has been argued that the associated reduction in the costs of trade a¤ected not only the
7:194:14490:22:21:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:patterns of specialization but also the pace of structural change (Fremdling 1975, Gutlerbet
7:195:14582:21:22:72:554:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:2012).  Unlike in the politically unied France, railway building in Germany was a highly
7:196:14671:22:22:72:554:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:decentralized decision, where local governments and business groups mattered (see the histories
7:197:14766:22:27:72:423:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of individual railway lines in Fremdling, Federspiel, and Kunz 1995).
7:198:14835:27:22:89:553:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:These two features taken together make for a unique, almost laboratory-style setting in
7:199:14922:22:22:72:554:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which to study the relationship between institutional change, trade, and growth. The next
7:200:15011:22:21:72:554:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:section provides additional information on railways in Germany, followed by a synopsis of
7:201:15100:21:0:72:346:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutional changes as a consequence of French rule.

8:203:15198:29:22:72:554:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Th einvention of steam locomotives in England in the early 1800sfueled widespread railway
8:204:15287:22:21:72:554:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:line construction, and it was arguably the most important of a series of transport innovations
8:205:15381:21:22:72:554:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(paved roads, improvements in waterways) that accompanied 19th century economic growth.
8:206:15468:22:22:72:554:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The rst German railway track was a 4-mile line from Nurnberg to Fürth opened in December
8:207:15557:22:21:72:554:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1835. The rst longer track was opened between Dresden and Leipzig in the year 1841 (70
8:208:15644:21:22:72:554:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:miles). Thereafter, additional miles of rail were laid down swiftly, and between 1840 and 1877
8:209:15738:22:22:72:554:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the length of German railway lines grew 60-fold. The pace of railway line building in Germany
8:210:15831:22:21:72:554:534:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:during this time was faster than either in England or in France (Putzger 2003). Figure 3 shows
8:211:15925:21:28:72:404:513:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the German railway system by 1880, the last year of our sample.
8:212:15988:28:22:89:553:485:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:How did this system emerge? One person who saw the potential of steam railways early on
8:213:16075:22:21:72:554:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:was the German-born economist Friedrich List, who proposed a national plan for Germanys
8:214:16163:21:22:72:554:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railway system in the year 1833; it is shown in Figure 4. Lists plan was in fact never imple-
8:215:16257:22:22:72:554:420:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mented. What List had planned was to connect the larger German points of trade with each
8:216:16345:22:21:72:554:398:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other. The reality, however, was quite di¤erent (see Fremdling, Federspiel, and Kunz 1995). In
8:217:16439:21:22:72:554:377:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the year 1850, for example, the major Southern cities of München (Bavaria), Stuttgart (Wurt-
8:218:16531:22:22:72:554:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:temberg), and Karlsruhe (Baden) were still not connected (see Figure 5). Also, the train line
8:219:16624:22:21:72:554:333:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from the Holstein city of Kiel heading south ended for a long time in the city of Altona (also
8:220:16718:21:22:72:554:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Holstein), just short of the major port of Hamburg. The reason for these omissions was that
8:221:16811:22:22:72:554:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the development of train lines often focused on the states own territories, without much con-
8:222:16905:22:21:72:554:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sideration given to national railway interests. Therefore it is unlikely that the train system as

8:224:17085:28:22:89:553:219:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The immediate impact of steam trains was that transport costs between two cities were
8:225:17170:22:21:71:553:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reduced (Fremdling 1995). In 19th century Germany, average freight rates on roads are esti-
8:226:17261:21:22:71:553:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mated at around 40 Pfennige per tonkilometer. Early railways cut these rates to about 11, and
8:227:17354:22:22:71:553:154:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rail improvements brought this down to less than 4 Pfennige by the end of the sample (Gut-
8:228:17444:22:21:71:553:132:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:lerbet 2012, Table 2). We study the impact of railways by comparing the speed with which
8:229:17532:21:22:71:553:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prices converged between cities served by railways versus between cities not served by railways.
8:230:17628:22:0:71:553:89:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Generally, railways were important for the transport of many low value-to-weight ratio goods,
9:231:17722:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:including grain (OBrien 1983, 1-2). While we do not have comprehensive information on wheat
9:232:17814:21:22:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tr aded via railroads, the great majority of all Bavarian grain exports to the south in the early
9:233:17911:22:22:72:554:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1850s was transported on railways (Seu¤ert 1857, Chapters 5, 6). Even though there is evi-
9:234:18001:22:21:72:554:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dence that railways mattered, the importance of railways for transporting grain varied greatly
9:235:18095:21:22:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:because transporting grain by ship was cheaper yet. In the late 19th century, for example,
9:236:18185:22:22:72:554:608:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sending grain from Posen (in East Prussia) to Cologne by railway was at least three times as
9:237:18277:22:27:72:546:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:expensive as transporting it by ship via Rotterdam and the Rhine River (Köttgen 1890, 64).
9:238:18367:27:22:89:553:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Some evidence on price gaps before and after the introduction of railways is shown in Figure
9:239:18459:22:22:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:6. The average wheat price gap in the years before steam rail transport is around 0.15, and
9:240:18550:22:21:72:554:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:it falls to about half that after a railway line is opened. While the placement of steam trains
9:241:18645:21:22:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is taken as exogenously given and alternative explanations are not accounted for, this gure
9:242:18737:22:22:72:554:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is consistent with railways bringing down price gaps. There is also evidence for heterogeneous
9:243:18831:22:43:72:490:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¤ects, with a decline of 0.20 for initially high price gaps (at the 95th percentile).

9:245:18958:30:21:72:554:377:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The main driver of institutional change in Germany during this t ime was arguably the inuence
9:246:19052:21:22:72:554:356:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from France.5The ideas of the French Revolution of 1789, including separationof powers,
9:247:19139:22:22:71:553:334:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:democracy, and human rights, found many followers in German areas, even though after the
9:248:19227:22:21:71:553:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:defeat of Napoleon in 1815 conservative forces were able to regain their hold on political power.
9:249:19324:21:22:71:553:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Revolutionary ideas from France swept through the German lands again in the year 1830 and
9:250:19413:22:28:71:206:269:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more signicantly in 1848.
9:251:19439:28:21:89:553:241:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Not all the new political ideas were implemented, but the ones that were had a strong impact
9:252:19531:21:22:71:553:220:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on economic institutions. When political rights imply economic rights, this follows naturally.
9:253:19625:22:22:71:553:198:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:For example, a constitution stating that everybody, including the king, is equal before the law
9:254:19720:22:21:71:553:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also stipulates that there is equality before the law for disputes in commercial transactions.
9:255:19814:21:22:71:553:155:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Other changes in economic institutions were related to the idea of freedom. For example, many
9:256:19907:22:22:71:553:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:German cities saw the abolishment of the requirement that skilled workers had to be members
9:257:19998:22:27:71:193:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the local crafts guild.
9:258:20024:27:0:85:446:84:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:5This section draws on Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2011; ACJR).
10:259:20102:0:22:89:553:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:There were a number of ways through which economic institutions were changed. First,
10:260:20186:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:th einstitutional changes were implemented as the direct consequence of French rule during the
10:261:20280:21:22:71:553:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:time of the French Revolutionary Wars. Between 1792 and 1795, for example, the seigneurial
10:262:20370:22:22:71:553:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:regime and the guilds were abolished in the Rhineland. The institutional changes did not end
10:263:20462:22:21:71:553:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with the rise of Napoleon to power, however, because he continued to implement the reforms
10:264:20552:21:26:71:152:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:initiated before.
10:265:20569:26:22:89:553:583:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, even after Napoleons defeat several German areas either kept or put in place
10:266:20654:22:22:71:553:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French-inspired institutional reforms. This may be interpreted as a recognition of the need to
10:267:20748:22:21:71:553:539:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:modernize on the part of German elites. Given Frances military victories, it was apparent
10:268:20838:21:22:71:553:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that German military, administration, and ultimately her economy was inferior to the French.
10:269:20930:22:22:71:553:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:While some of the institutional change in the German cities was defensive in nature, ACJR
10:270:21019:22:21:71:553:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:show that the decisive push was externally triggered by French rule during Revolutionary and
10:271:21111:21:26:71:162:453:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Napoleonic times.
10:272:21128:26:22:89:553:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Turning to some preliminary evidence on the relationship between institutional change and
10:273:21217:22:22:71:553:405:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city population growth, Figure 7 contrasts population size for the group of cities that imple-
10:274:21311:22:21:71:553:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mented institutional change relatively early with the group of cities that did so relatively late.
10:275:21409:21:22:71:553:362:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We see that cities implementing institutional change early were larger in the 1820s. The typical
10:276:21505:22:22:71:553:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city in either subsample grew by about one percent per year through the 1840s, before the size
10:277:21599:22:21:71:553:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of cities among the early adopters starts to grow much more rapidly. This gure is consistent
10:278:21692:21:22:71:553:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with a positive impact of institutional change on city growth. At the same time, this interpre-
10:279:21787:22:22:71:553:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tation of Figure 7 takes the timing of institutional change as exogenously given, an assumption
10:280:21882:22:50:71:221:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that we evaluate in section 5.
10:281:21912:50:33:71:141:203:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:3  Data
10:282:21919:33:22:71:554:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The paper focuses on forty German cities during the period 1820to1880. The sample period
10:283:22007:22:22:72:554:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:starts in 1820 because the rst years of the 19th century were tumultuous years of war and
10:284:22097:22:25:72:389:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:changing alliances that di¤er greatly from the following years.
10:285:22160:25:22:89:553:101:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The list of the forty cities is given in Table 1A. Economic growth is measured in terms of
10:286:22250:22:0:72:554:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the cities change in population size, a standard way of studying growth at the city level. Our
11:287:22346:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sample is largely determined by the availability of wheat price data, as well as by the available
11:288:22443:22:21:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in formation on the individual sample cities (statistical coverage was only fully harmonized after
11:289:22541:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the German Reich had been founded in 1871). We use data every ve years to reduce the e¤ect
11:290:22632:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of serial correlation in annual data. Although the sample is moderate in size, it covers the
11:291:22724:22:21:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:major German areas, and it has broad geographic coverage (see Figure 2), which is important
11:292:22815:21:22:72:553:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for any analysis of trade in a historical context.6While trade here is international in the sense
11:293:22912:22:22:72:553:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of b etween cities in independent polities, the ethnic and cultural proximity of the population
11:294:23007:22:21:72:554:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:suggests elements of domestic trade as well. We will return to this issue in section 6. As this
11:295:23102:21:22:72:554:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is an unbalanced panel, sample composition might be of concern. Therefore, we emphasize
11:296:23189:22:22:72:554:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:results from a sample where each city has more than sixty percent of all possible observations
11:297:23283:22:21:72:554:500:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(shown as the Base Sample in Table 1A). Cities from two polities, Bavaria and Mecklenburg,
11:298:23373:21:22:72:554:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are strongly represented in the sample; as our analysis will show, this does not drive the results
11:299:23471:22:28:72:141:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(see Table 5).
11:300:23485:28:21:89:553:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The sample covers many of the largest cities, such as Berlin, Hamburg, and München, but
11:301:23572:21:22:72:554:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also relatively small towns such as Boizenburg. The distribution of city size in the sample is
11:302:23666:22:22:72:554:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:approximately log-normal, see Figure 8. Specically, the inclusion of the smaller cities means
11:303:23760:22:21:72:554:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that the left tail is covered relatively well; whereas focusing on population sizes of 5,000 and
11:304:23856:21:22:72:554:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:above, a common data restriction, would mean the left tail is largely absent. There is no com-
11:305:23950:22:22:72:554:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prehensive information on migration for these cities. Migration movements however often led
11:306:24041:22:21:72:554:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to redistricting. Hence, we can gauge the importance of migration by employing an alternative
11:307:24134:21:22:72:554:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:population series that incorporates redistricting. The main sources of population data are the

12:320:25243:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:wheat was primarily a¤ected by random weather uctuations determining local harvests, and

12:322:25419:22:21:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:had  acomparative advantage, including the Black Sea area, Eastern Prussia, and the United
12:323:25509:21:22:72:554:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:States of America, wheat was produced in the vicinity of most sample cities, with the identity
12:324:25603:22:22:72:554:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of exporters and importers changing over time. While some producers were big, there was a

12:327:25871:28:21:89:553:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Generally, both price and quantity measures have been extensively used to study trade (e.g.,

12:331:26243:21:22:71:553:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tions costs cannot have been larger than the price gap (because that would be inconsistent with
12:332:26338:22:22:71:553:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:arbitrage), and not the precise level of transactions costs. At the same time, declining trans-
12:333:26433:22:21:71:553:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:port costs due to steam railways, improved contract enforcement, or increased trust between
12:334:26524:21:22:71:553:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:traders, among other things, are all plausibly reected in lower price gaps. Moreover, because
12:335:26618:22:22:71:553:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of its of central importance, wheat has been studied more than any other commodity in pre-
12:336:26708:22:21:71:553:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and early-industrial Europe (e.g., Persson 1999, Jacks 2006, and Federico 2007). For lack of
12:337:26800:21:22:71:553:300:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:direct evidence, we have to assume that wheat is representative for inferring transaction costs
12:338:26895:22:22:71:553:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for other goods. One advantage of wheat relative to most other goods is that it is rather ho-
12:339:26988:22:21:71:553:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mogeneous so that there is little reason to believe that the quality shipped varied substantially
12:340:27085:21:22:71:553:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with distance (Alchian-Allen conjecture). In the empirical sections 4.3 and 4.4, we will exam-
12:341:27179:22:22:71:553:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ine the importance of not directly observing trade by separating out major coastal and inland
12:342:27272:22:21:71:553:191:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:waterway ports. Due to the low cost of ship transport, it is plausible to assume that trade took
12:343:27368:21:22:71:553:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:place in these cities more frequently than in other cities, and price di¤erences involving these
12:344:27464:22:27:71:526:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:port cities would then be equal to, as opposed to the upper bound of, transactions costs.
12:345:27553:27:27:89:553:121:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The information on institutional change is developed along the lines of ACJR. For every city
12:346:27645:27:15:85:553:94:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:8Weabstract from storage, which we believe was not of rst-order importance for the analysis. For treatments
12:347:27753:15:0:71:347:79:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:of trade-cum-storage, see Shiue (2002) and Steinwender (2014).
13:348:27817:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and year in the sample, we code 0/1 variables for (1) the abolition of guilds, (2) a guarantee
13:349:27911:21:22:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  equality before the law, and (3) the possibility to redeem feudal lands. Any of these three
13:350:28006:22:22:72:554:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:conditions are indicative of good institutions in the sense that they are conducive to economic
13:351:28101:22:21:72:554:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¢ciency. Perhaps most controversial is the abolition of guilds. In late 18th century Germany,
13:352:28195:21:22:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:guilds tended to control entry to all major occupations and also at times restricted the adoption
13:353:28292:22:22:72:554:608:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of new technologies (Ogilvie 2004). While guilds in Europe and other countries have not always
13:354:28386:22:21:72:554:586:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:been in the way of economic e¢ciency (Epstein 1998, Shiue and Keller 2007), on balance we
13:355:28475:21:22:72:554:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesize that the abolition of guilds is a sign of improvement of economic institutions. The
13:356:28570:22:28:72:377:543:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:empirical results below are consistent with this hypothesis.9
13:357:28631:28:21:89:553:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Note that these three indicators capture aspects of regulation  for di¤erent economic sec-
13:358:28721:21:22:71:553:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tors. Moreover, each of these variables is a proxy for regulations a¤ecting a whole range of
13:359:28813:22:22:71:553:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:activities. For example, the regulation of crafts that abolished the requirement of guild mem-
13:360:28907:22:21:71:553:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bership (Gewerbefreiheit) often coincided with equivalent concessions permitting the setting
13:361:28999:21:22:71:553:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:up of manufacturing activities. Similarly, the year in which equality before the law was guar-
13:362:29093:22:22:71:553:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:anteed through a written civil code was correlated with the presence of a written commercial
13:363:29185:22:21:71:553:385:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:code. In general, these indicators could be interpreted as a general sign of an e¢ciency-oriented
13:364:29282:21:28:71:480:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economy, rather than astheinstitutions that matter for economic performance.
13:365:29358:28:22:89:554:336:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We dene the institutions in a particular citykand yeart,Instktas the average of these
13:366:29444:22:21:71:554:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:0/1  indicators. We refer to this at times as the institutional quality of a city. Further, when
13:367:29540:21:22:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the unit of analysis is the city pair we form the average of the institutional qualities of the
13:368:29635:22:22:72:554:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:two cities in that pair. As will become clear from the analysis below, the main results are not
13:369:29730:22:27:72:371:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:specic to particular ways of dening institutional quality.
13:370:29790:27:22:89:553:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our measure of railways is based on the development of the railway network over time.
13:371:29875:22:22:72:554:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We employ digital maps showing the location of train lines in every year of the 19th century

13:375:30249:16:8:71:361:114:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:variable as well, nding that it does not add much to our analysis.
13:376:30316:8:16:81:553:106:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:10Freight rates, on which we do not have comprehensive information, presumably increased with distance.
13:377:30419:16:0:71:553:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:Because our 0/1 railway variable does not capture that, we include bilateral distance directly in the regression.
14:378:30534:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:price gaps in that it covers rich bilateral variation. Note that the bilateral rail connections are
14:379:30633:22:21:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:no tindependentthe rail connection between München and Bamberg went over Nurnberg, for
14:380:30720:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:example (see Figure 3)and consequently, if railways did a¤ect the strength of arbitrage this
14:381:30813:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¤ect would not be identical for all city pairs. The importance of this e¤ect varies with bilateral
14:382:30912:22:26:72:373:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:distance, which will be included in all specications below.
14:383:30972:26:22:89:553:604:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Table 1A reports the earliest bilateral train connection for each city in the sample. For
14:384:31061:22:21:72:554:582:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:example, the rst train connection in the sample was in the year 1841, for both Dresden and
14:385:31152:21:22:72:554:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Leipzig, because in this year the direct line between these two cities was opened. Alternatively
14:386:31248:22:22:72:554:539:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:one could conceivably dene a city-level variable that is equal to one when a city gets its rst
14:387:31344:22:21:72:554:517:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railway station, or a variable that counts the number of railway connections to other sample
14:388:31436:21:22:72:554:496:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cities.  This could be misleading in the German context, however, because numerous local
14:389:31524:22:22:72:554:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railroad networks were started simultaneously but actual connections between them occurred
14:390:31614:22:26:72:163:452:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:only much later.11
14:391:31632:26:21:89:553:426:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The instrumental variable for institutional change is the leng th of French rule during the
14:392:31723:21:22:72:554:405:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:period 1793 to 1815. The fact that French rule was externally imposed is an attractive feature,
14:393:31818:22:22:72:554:383:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from the point of view of this approach. In addition, the primary French motives were not
14:394:31907:22:21:72:554:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economic but defensive (bu¤er zone versus Austria and Prussia) and ideological (exporting the
14:395:32000:21:22:72:554:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ideas of the French revolution) in nature. Our variable is dened as e¤ective French rulethat
14:396:32094:22:22:72:554:318:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is, rule through France or through a French-controlled satellite state, excluding purely military
14:397:32191:22:21:72:554:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:occupations in the area in which a particular city is located.12The length of French rule ranges
14:398:32288:21:22:71:553:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:fro m0 to 19 years in our sample, with higher values mostly in Germanys west and northwest,
14:399:32380:22:26:71:140:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:see Table 1B.
14:400:32393:26:22:89:553:227:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We employ the costs of operating a particular railway as instrumental variable. A major
14:401:32480:22:22:71:553:205:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:determinant of whether a particular route would be built in the rst place has to do with
14:402:32569:22:21:71:553:183:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the feasibility and costs of operating a track. Railway costs are derived from Nicolls (1878)
14:403:32662:21:22:71:553:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:who presents information on how much freight capacity had to be given up when operating on
14:404:32752:22:22:71:553:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:steeper versus atter terrain. According to this source, if a locomotive has 1,200 tons pulling
14:405:32847:22:24:71:553:118:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:capacity on at land, this goes down to 1,150 tons with a gradient of 5 feet to the mile, down
14:406:32941:24:12:81:526:94:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:11Also,weinclude city xed e¤ects which account for di¤erences in when cities had their rst railway.
14:407:33042:12:0:81:517:82:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:12In addition to moving to a city-level analysis, we have extended ACJRs dataset, see Appendix A.
15:408:33142:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to 939 tons if the gradient is 10 feet to the mile, and so on (see Appendix A for details). Using
15:409:33239:21:22:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:th is information to t a smooth cost function, we apply the ArcGIS least-cost distance module

15:411:33430:22:21:72:553:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:B:in the sample. Because these railway costs necessarily increase with distance between citiesj

15:415:33713:27:22:89:553:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to this data we employ a range of other variables in the analysis. They include
15:416:33804:22:22:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information on coal deposits (Gutlerbet 2012), religion, secondary schooling (Keyser 1939), ship

15:418:33993:21:22:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their distance from Paris, and other variables. Summary statistics are shown in Table 1B, and

15:421:34181:34:21:72:554:387:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In order to examine the impact of institutions and railways ontr ade, we use French rule and
15:422:34273:21:22:72:554:366:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railway costs as instrumental variables. The terrain surrounding the location of cities is well-
15:423:34369:22:22:72:554:344:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:known to a¤ect the costs of railways (Nicolls 1878), although this hypothesis has not been
15:424:34459:22:21:72:554:322:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tested in this context. Institutional change in German cities during the 19th century is related
15:425:34555:21:22:72:554:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to the length of French rule around the turn of the century, building on the work by ACJR. In
15:426:34648:22:22:72:554:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this section, we present the identication strategy, followed by the reduced form relationship
15:427:34742:22:21:72:554:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between trade, railway cost and French rule. We then turn to our estimates of the impact of
15:428:34833:21:44:72:273:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railways and institutions on price gaps.

15:430:34900:29:22:72:553:163:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Our approach requires that the instrumental variables, railwa ycosts and French rule, a¤ect

18:525:38722:26:21:89:553:669:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The OLS coe¢cients for railway cost are both positive, indicating that higher railway costs
18:526:38813:21:22:72:554:648:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:lead to higher price gaps (Table 2, column 1).14This is in line with expectations: high railway

18:528:39006:22:21:72:554:604:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:price gaps, consistent with French rule leading to institutional improvements that beneted

18:530:39173:42:22:89:553:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:Robustness ChecksWe rst consider the importance of sampling for our results. In the
18:531:39257:22:21:72:554:519:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:present case, the inuence of changes in sample composition appear to be limited because we
18:532:39348:21:22:72:554:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nd the results with the sample of all 40 cities to be similar as those for the base sample (see
18:533:39444:22:22:72:554:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:column 2, versus column 1, respectively). Second, we see that the mere existence of French
18:534:39534:22:21:72:554:454:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rule, a 0/1 indicator, is less strongly correlated with price gaps than the length of French rule
18:535:39631:21:22:72:554:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in years; this provides support to the instrumental variables strategy (column 3). Third, we
18:536:39723:22:22:72:554:411:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:turn to specication issues. The dependent variable,P_gapis bounded from below by zero
18:537:39809:22:21:72:554:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in contrast to OLS which assumes support from-1to+1:OLS is also relatively prone to
18:538:39892:21:22:72:554:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:outliers. To see whether boundedness and outliers unduly bias our ndings we apply other
18:539:39980:22:22:72:554:346:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:estimation methods. Using median regression gives broadly similar results to OLS (Table 2,
18:540:40070:22:21:72:554:324:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:column 4). Moving closer to the lower bound, column 5 shows that at the 25th percentile the
18:541:40161:21:22:72:554:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:impact of French rule and railway costs is qualitatively the same as according to OLS. These
18:542:40253:22:22:72:553:281:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:results suggest that the boundedness ofP_gapdoes not greatly a¤ect the OLS results. We also

19:553:41168:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:could change price gaps. If the other potential correlates did not change much over time, such
19:554:41262:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as foot tra¢c over the mountain range, then this will be captured by the city pair xed e¤ects.
19:555:41357:22:27:72:489:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Some factors may have changed however, and here we address a number of them.
19:556:41433:27:22:89:553:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our approach is to estimate the augmented reduced form regression (5) and to see whether
19:557:41521:22:22:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the reduced form coe¢cients on French rule and railway costs are a¤ected in the presence of
19:558:41612:22:21:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:alternative explanations, which are introduced one at a time. Results are shown in Table 3.
19:559:41703:21:22:72:554:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Column 1 gives the reduced-form results of Table 2, column 6 again. Column 2 presents the rst
19:560:41797:22:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:alternative, which is an indicator of whether the two cities were connected by railway according
19:561:41893:22:21:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to Lists 1833 railway plan. If the List plan anticipated early railway building, the inclusion of
19:562:41991:21:22:72:554:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this variable may weaken the railway cost coe¢cients, and it may also detect whether price gap
19:563:42085:22:22:72:554:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reductions are just a sign of a generally promising region. To allow for possibly time-varying
19:564:42179:22:21:72:553:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¤ects we include the List plan variable interacted with a xed e¤ect for each decade;16these
19:565:42272:21:22:72:554:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:coe ¢cients are shown in the lower part of Table 3. We see from the results that the List variable
19:566:42370:22:22:72:554:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:has no major e¤ect on price gaps, and the reduced form railway and French rule coe¢cients
19:567:42459:22:27:72:187:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are largely unchanged.
19:568:42481:27:22:89:553:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, railways were particularly important for coal-producing areas because they allowed
19:569:42571:22:22:72:554:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for cost e¤ective trade in coal. Further, coal producing areas experienced relatively high growth
19:570:42668:22:21:72:553:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:during the 19th century, and this growth may have reduced price gaps.17While coal was
19:571:42753:21:22:72:553:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:imp  ortant in Germanys 19th century industrialization, there is little evidence to suggest that
19:572:42850:22:28:72:404:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:coal has a major e¤ect on our identication strategy (column 3).
19:573:42914:28:21:89:553:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Third, geography and climate of an economy may be an important fundamental cause of
19:574:42997:21:22:72:554:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economic growth (Diamond 1997, Sachs 2001), and we know that geography helps to explain
19:575:43084:22:22:72:554:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the extent of trade (Tinbergen 1962, Nunn and Puga 2012). While climatic di¤erences in the
19:576:43174:22:21:72:554:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sample are relatively small, di¤erences in elevation are more pronounced. Northern areas in
19:577:43265:21:27:72:554:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Germany tend to be level whereas signicant elevations are seen in the South. We look for the
19:578:43358:27:12:81:399:109:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:16The exception to this are the nal years of the sample period, 1865-80.
19:579:43431:12:16:81:553:97:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:17Gutlerbet (2012) has emphasized the role of coal for regional development in 19th century Germany recently.
19:580:43540:16:0:72:472:81:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:The promise of future growth in German coal areas may also be one reason for French rule.
20:581:43631:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:e¤ects of geography in terms of latitude and longitude. Latitude tends to enter with a negative
20:582:43726:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:co e¢cient (column 4), perhaps reecting the greater availability of cheap waterway transport
20:583:43819:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the North of Germany.18At the same time, conditional on covariates there is no evidence
20:584:43909:22:22:72:553:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that latitude or longitude are highly correlated with price gapsandthe proposed instrumental
20:585:44001:22:27:72:120:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables.
20:586:44011:27:22:89:553:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Fourth, there may also be cultural di¤erences that explain why price gaps came down at
20:587:44097:22:22:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:di¤erent speeds. For example, Max Weber (1930) famously argued that the Protestant work
20:588:44184:22:21:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ethic is conducive to economic e¢ciency. In line with Webers thesis, we nd that price gaps
20:589:44276:21:22:72:554:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tend to be lower among predominantly Protestant cities, though this e¤ect is more or less
20:590:44365:22:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:orthogonal to our instrumental variables (column 6).  Becker and Woessmann (2009) have
20:591:44451:22:21:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:recently emphasized that Protestantism is highly correlated with human capital accumulation
20:592:44542:21:22:72:554:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in 19th century Prussia. To examine these issues, we include an indicator for whether a city
20:593:44634:22:22:72:553:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:had formal secondary schooling (Gymnasiums) early on, which is seen as a general measure of
20:594:44725:22:21:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the local emphasis on human capital. Our results are in line with Becker and Woessmanns
20:595:44813:21:22:72:554:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ndings in the sense that the patterns of coe¢cients for Protestantism and human capital are
20:596:44905:22:22:72:554:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:quite similar (columns 6 and 7). At the same time, the French rule and railway cost coe¢cients
20:597:44999:22:27:72:214:364:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:remain largely unchanged.19
20:598:45026:27:22:89:554:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Fifth, another consideration is that the probability of French rule may have been negatively
20:599:45118:22:22:72:554:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:correlated with the distance from Paris, not least because a short distance kept military and
20:600:45211:22:21:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:occupation costs relatively low.  As we are interested in the impact of French rule on the
20:601:45301:21:22:72:554:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions of German cities, and not the mere fact that a city was ruled by France, we present
20:602:45397:22:22:72:554:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a specication with the distance from Paris on the right hand side. If the inclusion of distance
20:603:45493:22:21:72:554:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from Paris wipes out the French rule coe¢cients we cannot identify the institutions e¤ect on
20:604:45585:21:22:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:price gaps. However, the relative ease of occupation as captured by distance from Paris does
20:605:45677:22:28:72:359:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not account for the entire French rule e¤ect (column 8).
20:606:45733:28:27:89:553:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As the sixth factor, we consider the inuence of water transport and international trade.
20:607:45822:27:15:81:554:130:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:18We   measure latitude in column 4 as the average latitude of the two cities, recognizing that when the two
20:608:45930:15:12:72:554:115:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:cities latitudes are quite di¤erent the average will not be close to either citys latitude. We have explored this
20:609:46045:12:12:72:554:103:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:issue by redening the variable, nding that it has only a limited e¤ect in our analysis. A number of results are
20:610:46158:12:9:72:259:91:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:shown in Table A, columns (4A) and (5A).
20:611:46198:9:0:81:478:82:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:19Similar results are obtained using the actual year of opening of a citys rstGymnasium.
21:612:46290:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Rail transport competed with waterway transport, and transport costs by water fell over time
21:613:46382:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as  well.20While adding an indicator of waterway location shows that citieswith access to
21:614:46471:21:22:71:553:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:water transport experienced more rapidly declining price gaps, the railway cost coe¢cients
21:615:46561:22:22:71:553:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:do not change by much (column 9).  Further, the nature of wheat trade in central Europe
21:616:46648:22:21:71:553:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:changed during the 19th century due to increasing imports from the United States of America.
21:617:46740:21:22:71:553:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:If important, it should a¤ect coastal cities more than other sample areas, especially at times
21:618:46834:22:22:71:553:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of low grain prices in the United States. Including an indicator for this into the reduced form
21:619:46929:22:21:71:553:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we see quite similar patterns as before, making it unlikely that such e¤ects greatly a¤ect our
21:620:47023:21:28:71:307:544:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variables strategy (column 10).21
21:621:47069:28:22:89:553:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The waterway indicators are also useful to assess the importanc ethat in general the price
21:622:47159:22:21:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:gaps give only the upper bound as opposed to the exact level of bilateral transactions costs.
21:623:47252:21:22:72:554:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Port cities had access to the low-cost mode of transportation during this time (Gutlerbet 2012,
21:624:47347:22:22:72:554:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Table 2), making it likely that wheat was traded at these cities in virtually every period (even
21:625:47443:22:21:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:when a port city would not export its own wheat production or import for its own consumption,
21:626:47536:21:22:72:554:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:there could be entrepôt trade). This allows us to examine how important it is for our results
21:627:47629:22:22:72:554:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that it is unobserved whether trade actually took place in a given year between two particular
21:628:47723:22:21:72:554:364:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cities. The reduced-form results in Table 3 are not very di¤erent when we control for ship
21:629:47813:21:22:72:554:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:transport or not (column 1 versus columns 9 and 10), which suggests that the fact that price
21:630:47905:22:22:72:554:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:gaps are only equal to transactions costs whenever there is actual trade plays a limited role in
21:631:48001:22:27:72:476:299:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:our analysis. This result is in line with recent ndings in Steinwender (2014).22
21:632:48082:27:22:89:553:272:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:These results may be summarized as follows. While there are some  changes in the reduced-
21:633:48171:22:22:72:554:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:form coe¢cients through the inclusion of other variables, the signs on the proposed instrumental
21:634:48267:22:21:72:554:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables never change, and the highest p-value of the test of joint signicance for the instru-
21:635:48363:21:22:72:554:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mental variables is 0.8%, compared to 0.2% in the baseline estimation. Overall, the results of
21:636:48457:22:27:72:411:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Table 3 provide support that the trade exclusion restrictions hold.
21:637:48524:27:12:81:222:158:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:A:20See   Gutlerbet (2012), Table 2.
21:638:48558:12:16:81:553:146:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:21We have also considered communications improvements such as the telegraph, however, city-level informa-
21:639:48663:16:8:72:195:130:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:tion was not available to us.
21:640:48692:8:16:81:553:122:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:22There, whether one focuses on periods in which there is trade or not, the evidence that the introduction
21:641:48798:16:11:72:554:106:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:of the telegraph lowered the New York-Liverpool price gap for cotton is equally strong in a statistical sense

22:643:48937:0:29:72:464:715:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:4.4  The Impact of Institutions and Railways on Trade
22:644:48990:29:22:72:553:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, the rst stage relationships between instrumental variables and the endogenous
22:645:49085:22:21:72:554:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables, institutions and railways, are analyzed. We also explore whether these relationships
22:646:49180:21:45:72:498:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:di¤er across various subgroups in the sample to see how local the relationships are.
22:647:49264:45:22:89:554:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:First-stage RelationshipsWe begin with the rst-stage relationship between the instru-
22:648:49350:22:21:72:554:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mental variables and institutional change, see Table 4, column 1. A longer French rule leads
22:649:49442:21:22:72:554:555:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to a higher institutional quality. This is consistent with French rule triggering institutional
22:650:49537:22:22:72:554:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:improvements, in line with ACJRs ndings at the level of polities. The rst-stage F-statistic
22:651:49631:22:21:72:554:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is 4.30. Even though it is lower than the rule of thumb of 10 proposed by Staiger and Stock
22:652:49722:21:22:72:554:490:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(1997), French rule is not a weak instrument. The F-statistic is robust and the city-pair level
22:653:49817:22:22:72:554:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:clustering allows for an arbitrary variance-covariance matrix capturing potential serial correla-

22:658:50292:21:28:71:499:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city-pair analysis. We will return to the institutions rst stage in section 5.4 below.
22:659:50379:28:22:89:553:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We estimate negative coe¢cients on railway costs (signicant in 1840-60), indicating that
22:660:50468:22:21:72:554:310:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:higher railway costs reduced the probability of a railway connection between two cities, relative
22:661:50565:21:22:72:554:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to the placebo period of 1820-35 during which steam locomotives were not yet available in
22:662:50654:22:22:72:554:267:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Germany (Table 4, column 2).  The rst-stage F-statistic is around 25 and the p-value is
22:663:50742:22:21:72:554:245:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:virtually 0. French rule tends to lower the chance that railways exist. As noted above, France
22:664:50836:21:22:72:554:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:was slower than Germany in building railway lines so this is consistent with the impact of
22:665:50926:22:27:72:211:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French rule on institutions.
22:666:50954:27:22:89:553:175:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The instrumental variables approach will estimate the impact of railways on price gaps for
22:667:51044:22:22:71:553:153:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:those city-pairs that were induced by relatively low railway costs to establish railways.  To
22:668:51137:22:27:71:553:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:see which types of cities were a¤ected by railway costs, we estimate the railway rst stage for

23:670:51343:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:various subsamples of our data. This also shows whether the instrumental variables estimates
23:671:51435:22:27:72:517:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ar every localthat is, whether railway costs matter only for a few observationsor not.
23:672:51523:27:22:89:553:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We rst distinguish cities that are relatively far from each other from others that are more
23:673:51615:22:22:72:554:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nearby. The coe¢cients on railway cost tend to be negative and quite similar (columns 3 and
23:674:51706:22:21:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:4). Distinguishing cities that are relatively far from Paris from those that are closer to Paris
23:675:51802:21:22:72:554:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:shows that high railway costs deterred railway building in both subsamples (columns 5 and 6).
23:676:51895:22:22:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Further, while railway connections were generally more prevalent in Protestant than in Catholic
23:677:51990:22:21:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:areas, high railway costs reduced railway building in both sets of cities (columns 7 and 8). There
23:678:52088:21:22:72:554:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is also evidence that high railway costs deterred railway building for cities with access to water
23:679:52186:22:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:transport (column 9).24The reason for this may be that most navigable rivers in Germany   ow

23:681:52373:21:22:72:554:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:including by rail. Overall these results indicate that the rst-stage relationship for railways
23:682:52468:22:22:72:554:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:holds in a number of subsamples, and our instrumental variable estimates are not identied
23:683:52558:22:27:72:300:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from a small number of special observations.
23:684:52602:27:40:89:446:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now estimate the e¤ect of railways and institutions on price gaps:

23:688:52720:40:21:89:553:322:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The  railway instrumental variables coe¢cient is about -0.1 and the institutions coe¢cient
23:689:52810:21:22:72:554:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is about -0.4 (Table 5, column 1).25Both the introduction of railways and better institutions
23:690:52903:22:22:72:554:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:imp  roved trade in the sense of bringing down price gaps. The instrumental variables coe¢cients
23:691:52999:22:21:72:554:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are larger (in absolute value) than the OLS which are also shown. There could be a number of
23:692:53091:21:22:72:554:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reasons for this, including measurement error in the railways and institutions variables, or that
23:693:53188:22:22:72:554:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:OLS su¤ers from omitted variables bias. Another potential reason is that instrumental variable
23:694:53282:22:27:72:554:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:estimation for railways measures the local average treatment e¤ect on city pairs induced to have
23:695:53378:27:12:81:553:165:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:24The subsample of waterway city pairs is relatively small, and no overly strong conclusions should be drawn.
23:696:53487:12:15:81:553:153:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:25The Kleibergen-Paap (2006) F statistic here is 21.65, well above Stock and Yogos (2005) critical value for
23:697:53596:15:12:72:554:138:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:10% maximal bias and iid errors of 4.72 (LIML), providing more evidence on the power of the instruments.
23:698:53700:12:12:72:554:126:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:Results from overidentication tests are not reported because it can be expected that the second-stage results
23:699:53810:12:12:72:554:114:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:depend on which subset of instruments is employed, given that we have two endogenous variables. The rst
23:700:53914:12:12:72:554:102:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:stage regressions of Table 5, column 1 are shown in Table 4, columns 1 and 2. Full detail on the rst stages of
23:701:54025:12:0:72:478:90:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:Table 5 are not reported for space reasons; they are available upon request from the authors.
24:702:54120:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:railways (whereas OLS measures the correlation across the full sample), or the instrumental
24:703:54211:21:22:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:va riables violate the exclusion restrictions. These possibilities cannot be fully evaluated because
24:704:54311:22:27:72:345:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:they depend on characteristics that are not observed.
24:705:54364:27:22:89:553:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:However, it is unlikely that violating the exclusion restrictions is the main reason why the
24:706:54456:22:22:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variable estimates are larger (in absolute value) than the OLS because above
24:707:54545:22:21:72:554:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we have seen little evidence that the instrumental variables are, conditional on covariates,
24:708:54637:21:22:72:554:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:correlated with other determinants of price gaps (Table 3). Additionally, the impact of the
24:709:54728:22:22:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variables was not systematically di¤erent depending on the strength of the rst
24:710:54820:22:21:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stage (Table 4). In contrast, omitted variables bias is likely, given the many factors that could
24:711:54917:21:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:inuence railway building and institutional change, and because both railway and institutions
24:712:55010:22:22:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables vary only between 0 and 1, measurement error is likely as well. Moreover, to the
24:713:55100:22:21:72:554:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:extent that the introduction of steam ships improved trade for waterway cities, the substitution
24:714:55196:21:22:72:554:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between railways and steam ships would mean OLS is upwardly biased, consistent with our
24:715:55283:22:27:72:503:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:nding that the OLS estimates are larger than the instrumental variables estimates.
24:716:55366:27:22:89:553:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The institutions e¤ect is quantitatively larger than that of railways, with standardized beta
24:717:55459:22:21:71:553:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:coe¢cients of -0.76 and -0.20, respectively. Some readers may nd this result surprising at rst.
24:718:55556:21:22:71:553:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:However, it has become increasingly clear that institutions a¤ect trade in a range of markets
24:719:55649:22:22:71:553:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(product, nancial, and labor). Also, not only formal institutions dening the contracting and
24:720:55743:22:21:71:553:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:property rights environment matter but informal institutions sustained by repeated interaction,
24:721:55838:21:44:71:294:294:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:networks, or cultural beliefs do so as well.26
24:722:55884:44:21:89:554:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:Robustness checksWe  rst examine the inuence of the city pair structure of the data
24:723:55969:21:22:71:553:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on our inferences. A disturbance to the price in citykwill a¤ect all observations involving
24:724:56060:22:22:71:554:207:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cityk;and to address this issue we cluster by city (not city-pair); as seen from column 1A,
24:725:56151:22:21:71:553:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:our inferences are unchanged. Second, we explore the role of our railway cost variable. The
24:726:56242:21:22:71:553:164:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bilateral railway cost proxy is derived from an U.S. railway building manual using a specic
24:727:56334:22:22:71:553:142:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cost function (see Appendix A for details), for example. However, if instead we abstract from
24:728:56427:22:26:71:553:120:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the specic values and map our railway cost measures into ten bins with values from 1 to 10,
24:729:56519:26:15:81:554:94:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:26SeeNunn and Treer (2013). These authors examine the relationship between domestic institutions and
24:730:56620:15:0:72:537:79:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:comparative advantage, but similar arguments apply to trade that is not based on comparative advantage.
25:731:56725:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the results are similar (Table 5, column 2). This suggests that the specic values of our railway
25:732:56822:21:28:72:244:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:co st estimates play a limited role.
25:733:56858:28:22:89:553:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We then gauge the inuence of changing sample composition by comparing the restricted
25:734:56943:22:21:72:554:645:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with the full-sample results, nding no qualitative di¤erence. The representativeness of our
25:735:57035:21:22:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sample cities for Germany as a whole is explored in the city- and state-weighted regressions.
25:736:57128:22:22:72:554:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The nding that both railways and institutional change reduce price gaps holds also when we
25:737:57219:22:21:72:554:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reduce the number of Bavarian and Mecklenburg cities in the sample (see Table 5, columns 3
25:738:57309:21:28:72:100:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to 7).
25:739:57315:28:22:89:553:531:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We examine whether alternative denitions of institutions and French rule change the re-
25:740:57403:22:21:72:554:509:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sults. There is a smaller impact of institutions if redeemability of feudal lands is incorporated
25:741:57500:21:22:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the denition of institutions, although it still remains larger than the railways e¤ect (for
25:742:57595:22:22:72:554:466:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this and the following, see Table 6). Results are similar if we adopt a 0/1 measure of French
25:743:57688:22:21:72:554:444:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rule, or code French rule in the Hanse cities (Hamburg, Bremen, and Luebeck) the same as
25:744:57776:21:22:72:553:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:everywhere else even though the nature of French rule there was di¤erent.27The 19th century is
25:745:57870:22:22:71:554:401:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:als oa period of broad political change, and we explore the impact of wars, the 1848 revolution,
25:746:57966:22:21:72:554:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and the formation of the Zollverein, nding that the inuence of these events on the results is
25:747:58061:21:28:72:111:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:limited.
25:748:58069:28:22:89:554:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Two other issues are rst, the denition ofP_gap;our measure of trade, and second,
25:749:58151:22:21:72:554:308:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:potential spillover e¤ects. To the extent that waterway observations are more informative on
25:750:58243:21:22:72:554:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:transactions costs than non-waterway observations because water transport was low-cost and
25:751:58333:22:22:72:554:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:hence there was more frequently trade, separating out waterway observations is a way to see
25:752:58424:22:21:72:554:243:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whether more informative observations give substantially di¤erent results. We nd that this is
25:753:58518:21:28:72:422:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not the case (compare column 9 of Table 6 with column 1, Table 5).
25:754:58584:28:22:89:554:194:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, there could be spillovers from a rail connection between citiesjandkfor other
25:755:58669:22:21:72:554:172:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cities, and these may either be positive or negative. This is a well-known challenge in research
25:756:58765:21:22:72:554:151:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on place-based infrastructure projects that we cannot fully resolve in this paper. It is possible
25:757:58862:22:27:72:554:129:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to shed some light on this issue in our historical setting, however, because early railways were
25:758:58958:27:16:81:554:102:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:27The overriding goal of French rule in the Hanse cities was to enforce the continental blockade towards
25:759:59062:16:0:72:334:86:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:England, which by its very nature was detrimental to trade.
26:760:59123:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:generally built on a state-by-state basis and centered on the state capital. This created a hub-
26:761:59219:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:an d-spoke system, and a new rail connection between two state capitals often led to connections

26:763:59416:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:one would expect them to result from rail connections between state capitals. Excluding state
26:764:59509:22:21:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:capitals from the sample, however, leads to qualitatively similar results as before (Table 6,
26:765:59602:21:28:72:510:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:column 10). This suggests that spillovers of this type do not a¤ect the main ndings.

26:772:59936:31:22:72:553:485:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:For  example, we ask whether adding an indicator variable for being on Lists railway plan from

26:774:60124:22:21:72:554:441:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Appendix; this table also addresses the issue that variables such as latitude have no natural

26:780:60669:28:51:89:463:305:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to the relationship between institutions, trade, and growth.

26:782:60775:33:22:72:553:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, we are interested in the institutions impact o ngrowth through trade.28Using
26:783:60869:22:39:72:498:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the result from the previous section that institutional change a¤ects trade, we have

26:785:60993:29:15:81:553:131:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:28For  simplicity here we focus on trade, not also railways, and writeT rade(Inst; X)in the following. The
26:786:61099:15:0:72:477:116:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:railway impact should be picked up by trade because railway costs is one of our instruments.
27:787:61193:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and the question is how much of institutions e¤ect on city growth goes through trade (\f1)
27:788:61283:21:40:71:227:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ver  sus not through trade (\f2):

27:790:61366:40:21:72:553:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Since institutions may be endogenous (and trade surely is) we employ French rule and railway
27:791:61458:21:22:72:554:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:costs as instrumental variables. Note that institutions and city size vary at the level of the
27:792:61552:22:22:72:553:572:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city while our measure of trade (the price gap between citiesjandk) is a city-pair variable.
27:793:61644:22:21:72:554:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:To implement equations (7) and (8) we map city-pair analysis to a regression at the level of
27:794:61736:21:22:72:554:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the city. We adopt the two-sample instrumental variables approach introduced by Angrist and
27:795:61827:22:22:72:554:507:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Krueger (1992).29In the current context, this amounts to constructing city-leve laverages of
27:796:61919:22:27:72:389:485:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city-pair variables. The approach is described in Appendix B.
27:797:61980:27:22:89:553:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In the following, we focus on the reduced-form relationship between city size and the pro-
27:798:62070:22:22:72:554:436:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:posed instrumental variables. We then estimate the impact of trade on city size (equation 7),
27:799:62163:22:21:72:554:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:before turning to the role of trade in the overall impact of institutions on growth (equation 8).
27:800:62260:21:44:72:356:393:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The section concludes with a discussion of our ndings.

28:827:63699:21:22:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:they reduced railway building, we expect negative coe¢cients on railway costs after 1835 (once
28:828:63793:22:22:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:steam locomotives had become available). The estimation results for equation (9) are shown in
28:829:63886:22:21:72:554:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Table 7, column 1. While not all coe¢cients are statistically signicant, the results are in line
28:830:63983:21:22:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with the proposed instrumental variables e¤ects. The institutions result also conrms ACJRs
28:831:64075:22:22:72:554:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:analysis at the city level. Similar results are obtained for the full sample of forty cities (column
28:832:64175:22:21:72:554:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:2). We also present results that downweigh inuential observations. While this raises slightly
28:833:64269:21:22:72:554:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the French rule e¤ects and lowers those of railway cost, the results are broadly similar (column
28:834:64365:22:44:72:427:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:3). Overall, these results support the instrumental variables strategy.
28:835:64436:44:29:72:368:363:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5.2  The City Size Exclusion Restrictions
28:836:64477:29:22:72:553:334:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Are the instrumental variables valid in the city size regressio n? In addition to being quasi-
28:837:64571:22:21:72:554:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:randomly assigned, the instrumental variables can neither directly impact city size nor be
28:838:64661:21:22:72:554:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:strongly correlated with a determinant of city size. We have seen above that railway costs do
28:839:64754:22:22:72:554:269:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not have a large impact on institutional change (Table 4). The previous section has shown that
28:840:64848:22:22:72:554:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French rule a¤ects trade, so if trade impacts city size clearly there is room for French rule to
28:841:64944:22:21:72:554:225:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a¤ect city size through another channel, namely trade. Does this invalidate the instrumental
28:842:65036:21:22:72:554:204:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables strategy? No, because a better trade environment is in part caused by institutional
28:843:65129:22:22:72:554:182:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:change, which is the link that we are interested in. Identication requires independence con-
28:844:65222:22:21:72:554:160:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ditional on the included covariates, and the question is whether French rule is correlated with
28:845:65317:21:22:72:554:139:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade or other determinants of city size that are not controlled for. To see how likely this is we
28:846:65415:22:22:72:554:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:estimate the city size reduced form equation (9) augmented with other plausible determinants
28:847:65507:22:0:72:554:95:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of city size; our main interest is whether the reduced-form estimates on railway cost and French
29:848:65605:0:28:72:229:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rule are substantially changed.
29:849:65636:28:21:89:553:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Re sults are shown in Table 8. Each of the columns 2 to 9 reports results from introducing,
29:850:65727:21:22:72:554:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:exibly with decade xed e¤ects, one possible determinant of city size on the right hand side of
29:851:65823:22:22:72:554:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equation (9). For example, in column 2 the added variable is coal production. While city size
29:852:65916:22:21:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is higher in coal areas in the early sample years, the coe¢cients for the proposed instrumental
29:853:66011:21:22:72:554:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variables do not change much compared to the baseline in column 1. This provides support for
29:854:66103:22:28:72:206:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the identication strategy.
29:855:66130:28:21:89:553:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:While the determinants of city size need not be the same as those of trade, many are
29:856:66214:21:22:72:554:532:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:plausibly the same and we analyze largely the same group as discussed earlier in Table 3.
29:857:66303:22:22:72:554:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Geography in terms of latitude tends to amplify the coe¢cients on French rule and railway cost
29:858:66397:22:21:72:554:488:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and does not pose a threat to identication. Cities further east tend to be smaller as the results
29:859:66495:21:22:72:554:467:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for longitude show (column 4). The French rule coe¢cients shrink somewhat upon inclusion
29:860:66583:22:22:72:554:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of longitude, which is not surprising given that French rule was less prevalent further east;
29:861:66676:22:21:72:554:423:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:importantly, the coe¢cients on French rule are positive even after controlling for longitude.
29:862:66769:21:22:72:554:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Adding Protestantism yields results similar to those for latitude, probably because Protestants
29:863:66864:22:28:72:495:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tended to live in the north while Catholics lived in the south of the German areas.
29:864:66947:28:21:89:553:352:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Looking at human capital as a determinant of city size, there is no evidence that relatively

29:866:67127:22:22:71:553:309:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Including distance to Paris would reduce the French rule coe¢cients if the French successfully
29:867:67221:22:21:71:553:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:targeted to rule areas with a high growth potential. We nd, if anything, the opposite (column
29:868:67315:21:22:71:553:266:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:7). Turning to the ease of trade, rst we see that the location of a city on a waterway does
29:869:67407:22:22:71:553:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not consistently a¤ect city population (column 8). In contrast, cities that were relatively more
29:870:67503:22:21:71:553:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:likely to engage in international trade because they were on the coast tend to be relatively

29:873:67784:22:27:71:439:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:location amplies the negative impact of high railway costs on city size.
29:874:67857:27:22:89:553:130:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Taken together, railway costs and institutions have reduced-form city size e¤ects in line
29:875:67946:22:22:71:553:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with expectations, a result that is robust to the inclusion of other potential determinants of
29:876:68040:22:0:71:426:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city size. This supports the proposed instrumental variables strategy.
30:877:68112:0:44:89:467:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In the following section, we turn to the instrumental variables estimation.

30:879:68244:29:40:72:535:644:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In this section we estimate the e¤ect of trade on city size using the following specication:

30:881:68382:39:22:72:553:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French rule and railway costs are employed as instrumental variables for trade. The rst stage

30:892:68576:43:21:72:553:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Applying the two-sample instrumental variables approach, we construct a city-level measure of

30:894:68761:22:40:72:343:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:B:is in turn inserted into equation (10) to estimate\f1:

30:897:68956:22:21:71:554:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:impact of institutional change. We obtain an estimate of-4:75;signicant at a 5% level (Table
30:898:69049:21:22:72:554:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:9, column 1).30This provides evidence that institutions increase growth byre ducing price gaps
30:899:69143:22:22:72:554:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in our sample. We can use median regression instead of least squares in the rst stage to address
30:900:69240:22:21:72:554:249:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the boundedness of price gaps; it leads to a similar estimate (though the rst stage is weaker;
30:901:69335:21:22:72:554:228:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:see column 2). The question we turn to in the next section is the extent to which institutions
30:902:69429:22:27:72:298:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:exert their impact on growth through trade.
30:903:69472:27:16:81:553:179:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:30Following Bjorklund and Jantti (1997), for valid inferences we bootstrap over the two-sample instrumental
30:904:69579:16:0:72:159:163:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:variables procedure.
31:905:69601:0:29:72:529:715:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5.4  Institutions and Growth: Trade versus non-Trade Channels
31:906:69662:29:22:72:553:686:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:To  determine the importance of trade for the impact of institutions on growth, ideally we would
31:907:69758:22:21:72:554:664:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:like to put institutions and trade in the city size equation. If adding institutions turns the e¤ect
31:908:69858:21:22:72:554:643:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of trade to zero, then trade is not an important proximate factor for institutions. Trade plays
31:909:69953:22:22:72:554:621:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a role only if it remains signicant after institutions in included. We have just estimated the
31:910:70048:22:21:72:554:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:impact of trade on growth, see equation (12). One can recast our question by asking whether
31:911:70139:21:22:72:554:578:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:B:Instis an important omitted variable in this equation. Adding institutions to equation (12)
31:912:70230:22:22:72:101:556:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:yields
31:913:70236:22:31:167:554:534:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:A:City_Sizekt= - +\f1\T r  ade(Inst; X)kt+\f2Instkt+ukt:(13)
31:914:70294:31:22:72:554:503:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Given that institutions may be endogenous, we use the length of French rule as an instrumental
31:915:70388:22:22:72:554:481:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variable. Because French rule is used to predict the trade variable, an important question is
31:916:70481:22:21:72:553:459:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whether the instrument has still enough power to estimate\f2separately from\f1:To nd out,
31:917:70571:21:22:71:553:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we examine the rst stage relationship between institutions and French rule conditional on
31:918:70661:22:28:71:101:416:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade.
31:919:70667:28:21:89:553:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The institutional quality of a city is increasing in the length of French rule (Table B, column
31:920:70762:21:22:71:553:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1), with a p-value of the F-test for inclusion that is virtually zero. In contrast, the trade variable
31:921:70864:22:22:71:553:345:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is far from being signicant at standard levels. This is evidence that the impact of French rule
31:922:70960:22:21:71:553:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on institutions is in part orthogonal to trade. The results also indicate that trade does not a¤ect
31:923:71059:21:22:71:553:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions. The latter is not always the case; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005b), for
31:924:71152:22:22:71:553:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:example show that the rise of Atlantic trade did a¤ect institutions in a number of European
31:925:71243:22:21:71:553:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:countries. We do not know at this point whether this is a true di¤erence relative to their result,
31:926:71341:21:28:71:401:237:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:or driven by the specics of our context, data, or specication.31
31:927:71407:28:22:89:553:209:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Using French rule as the instrumental variable, we turn to estim ating the impact of insti-
31:928:71498:22:21:72:554:187:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tutions through trade and non-trade channels, equation (13). The institutions coe¢cient is
31:929:71588:21:27:72:554:166:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:positivecity size is increasing in institutional qualitythough the coe¢cient is not precisely
31:930:71683:27:16:81:554:139:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:31Also ofinterest to us is to learn about the characteristics of cities that were induced by French rule to
31:931:71790:16:12:72:554:123:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:improve their institutions (columns 2 to 12, Table B). We see that with the exception of cities far from Paris
31:932:71900:12:12:72:554:111:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:and in Germanys east, French rule is a signicant determinant of institutions. Moreover, trade does usually not
31:933:72012:12:12:72:554:99:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:have an impact on institutions. Overall, these subsample results provide additional support that an institutions
31:934:72124:12:0:72:269:87:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:e¤ect independent of trade can be estimated.
32:935:72170:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:estimated and is insignicant at standard levels (column 3, Table 9). In contrast, trade has a
32:936:72264:21:22:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:co e¢cient of about-4:2, not very di¤erent from column 1 (although less precisely estimated).
32:937:72357:22:22:72:554:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Alternatively, using median regression for the trade rst stage yields similar conclusions (column
32:938:72455:22:27:72:93:651:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:4).32
32:939:72460:27:22:89:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:It is worth emphasizing that the results do not mean that institu tions have no causal e¤ect
32:940:72552:22:22:72:554:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on growth.  Institutions do have a positive impact on long-run growth.  This can be seen
32:941:72640:22:21:72:554:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:perhaps most easily by dropping the trade variable and estimating the impact of institutions
32:942:72732:21:22:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:B:(instrumented with French rule) on growth; the coe¢cient is positive and signicant at about0:5
32:943:72827:22:22:72:554:537:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(Table 9, column 5). Rather, our results indicate that trade is important as a channel through
32:944:72921:22:21:72:554:515:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which institutions a¤ect growth in our context. As we have shown in section 4, institutional
32:945:73013:21:22:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:change led to changes in trade. It is useful to think about this in terms of timing, as this helps
32:946:73111:22:22:72:554:472:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to establish the causal channels (see also Angrist and Pischke 2009, 68). The trade coe¢cient
32:947:73204:22:38:72:356:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:picks up an e¤ect that is ultimately due to institutions.
32:948:73261:38:22:89:554:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:Robustness ChecksWe rst examine the role of the railway cost instrumental variable.
32:949:73345:22:22:71:553:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Using a step function as opposed to the actual railroad cost estimates leads to similar results
32:950:73440:22:21:71:553:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(column 6). One might also be concerned that our nding that institutions work through trade
32:951:73532:21:22:71:553:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is obtained because our indicators of institutions are relatively close to trade. Equality before
32:952:73629:22:22:71:553:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the law, e.g., might matter directly for trade disputes. To explore this issue, we replace equality
32:953:73728:22:21:71:553:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:before the law with redeemability of feudal lands, an indicator of the power of landowners versus
32:954:73825:21:22:71:553:282:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their tenants. Now the trade coe¢cient is around-4:5, while institutions remains insignicant
32:955:73918:22:22:71:553:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(column 7).  Employing a broad denition of institutions based on all three indicators, the
32:956:74009:22:21:71:553:238:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade coe¢cient is similar in size (column 8). This suggests that our results are not sensitive
32:957:74104:21:28:71:298:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to particular aspects of institutional quality.
32:958:74151:28:22:89:553:189:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We have also explored the role of sample composition for the results. First, consider di¤erent
32:959:74245:22:21:71:554:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:numbers of observations. In the full sample of 40 cities, the trade coe¢cient is about-3:1while
32:960:74340:21:22:71:553:146:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the institutions coe¢cient is slightly larger and close to signicance (p-value of 0.139; column
32:961:74436:22:28:71:553:124:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1, Table 10). Full sample results for the broad institutions measure are similar (column 2).
32:962:74528:28:0:81:554:96:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:32The completerst-stage results of the specications in Table 9 are available upon request from the authors.
33:963:74639:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The results are not driven by the low-population states because we nd similar results with
33:964:74730:22:21:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:st ate-population weighting (column 3). There is more evidence that city size matters: the trade
33:965:74826:21:22:72:553:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:coe¢cient changes to about-1:7when the regression is weighted by city size, suggesting that
33:966:74917:22:28:71:418:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the impact was relatively larger for the smaller cities in the sample.
33:967:74987:28:21:89:553:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Next, we turn to the creation of the Zollverein customs union. It might not only explain
33:968:75075:21:22:71:553:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:part of the gains from trade, but, as a tool of Prussia to rule other German areas, the Zollverein
33:969:75173:22:22:71:553:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:might be correlated with the growth e¤ects of Germanys political unication. To see whether
33:970:75265:22:21:71:553:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this might be important we include the geography-based predictor of Zollverein membership of
33:971:75357:21:22:71:553:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Keller and Shiue (2013). As it turns out, the Zollverein predictor does not strongly a¤ect the
33:972:75451:22:22:71:553:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade nor the institutions coe¢cient (Table 10, column 5). The same holds when we include
33:973:75540:22:21:71:553:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:controls for revolutionary activity around the year 1848 and the wars during the sample period
33:974:75634:21:28:71:167:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(columns 6 and 7).
33:975:75652:28:22:89:553:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:How strong is the evidence for spillover e¤ects in the sense that improvements in one citys

33:977:75839:21:22:71:553:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that the trade coe¢cient is considerably smaller than before (column 8, Table 10, compared to
33:978:75932:22:22:71:553:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:column 3, Table 9). Apparently, a given improvement in trade a¤ects growth in state capitals
33:979:76024:22:21:71:553:358:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more strongly than in other cities. In contrast, the treatment status of the Hanse cities, in
33:980:76117:21:22:71:553:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which French rule took a special form because it was mainly concerned with enforcing the
33:981:76205:22:28:71:425:315:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:continental blockade, does not a¤ect the results by much (column 9).
33:982:76273:28:21:89:554:287:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We conclude this analysis by exploring measurement issues in the left hand side variable. A
33:983:76364:21:22:71:553:266:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:potential concern is that city size may not be fully comparable across cities and over time due
33:984:76459:22:22:71:553:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to migration between cities. Migration is not fully observed. However, migration often leads to
33:985:76554:22:21:71:553:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:redistricting of city boundaries, and we have data on an alternative city size series that includes
33:986:76653:21:22:71:553:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:redistricting. According to column 10, employing the alternative city population series that
33:987:76745:22:22:71:553:179:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:includes redistricting leads to similar results as in the baseline (Table 9, column 3). While this
33:988:76843:22:21:71:553:157:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:analysis cannot be taken as denitive, it suggests that migration does not play a rst-order role
33:989:76940:21:28:71:146:136:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for our results.
33:990:76956:28:22:89:553:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:To summarize, while the trade coe¢cient is not always precisely estimated, it is usually
33:991:77044:22:0:71:553:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:signicant and there is a clear pattern: more trade in the sense of lower price gaps is conducive
34:992:77143:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to city growth.  There is less evidence for an independent institutions e¤ect capturing the

34:994:77268:27:44:89:325:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to a discussion of these ndings.

34:1002:77810:27:22:89:554:459:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Wend that predicting city growth with institutions and trade accounts for more than half of
34:1003:77902:22:22:71:553:437:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the variation of city growth, see Figure 9. We can also explain the level of city growth at the low
34:1004:78001:22:21:71:553:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:end of the distribution, while the model tends to underestimate high rates of city growth. How
34:1005:78095:21:22:71:553:394:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:about the economic importance of institutions through non-trade channels? Taking the point
34:1006:78185:22:19:71:553:372:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimates of column 3, Table 9, and computing predicted city growth as^\f1-\T r  ade(Inst)kt+
34:1007:78278:19:24:72:554:353:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:B:^\f2-Instkt, we can account for about 57 percent of the variation in city size growth, up from
34:1008:78372:24:22:72:554:329:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:54 percent. Based on these results, trade is an economically signicant proximate factor in
34:1009:78463:22:22:72:554:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:explaining city growth, and the fundamental behind trade is mostly institutional change, as we
34:1010:78557:22:21:72:554:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:have seen in section 4. Moreover, trade appears to account for a large part of the total impact
34:1011:78652:21:45:72:202:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of institutions on growth.
34:1012:78678:45:21:89:553:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:Other Forms of InstitutionsIt is possible that trade may be only important as a
34:1013:78757:21:22:71:553:198:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:proximate cause for institutions impact on growth for the specic set of institutions that we
34:1014:78851:22:22:71:553:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:consider, but not for all institutions.  Perhaps trade is the proximate factor through which
34:1015:78943:22:21:71:553:154:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the abolition of trade guilds a¤ects growth, leaving open the possibility that other forms of
34:1016:79036:21:28:71:382:133:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions have growth e¤ects that are orthogonal to trade.
34:1017:79097:28:22:89:553:105:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:It is worth keeping in mind that our indicators of institutional change cover a range of
34:1018:79185:22:0:71:553:83:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sectors, legal aspects of di¤erent specicity, and they emphasize the situation on the ground (not
35:1019:79285:0:21:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:onlyde jurebut whether rules are enforced). Moreover, our indicators are correlated with other
35:1020:79379:21:22:72:554:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:elements of institutions (civil code went often hand in hand with commercial code, for example).
35:1021:79475:22:22:72:554:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:From this perspective it is reasonable to expect that our indicators are broad correlates of
35:1022:79567:22:21:72:554:651:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutional change. Delineating the precise set of institutions that works through trade is an
35:1023:79663:21:22:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:important question, but one that would likely require di¤erent identication strategies, and we
35:1024:79758:22:39:72:190:608:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:leave it to future work.
35:1025:79782:39:21:89:553:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:Proximate growth causes correlated with tradeAnother issue is whether we have
35:1026:79859:21:22:72:554:548:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:unduly biased the analysis by focusing on trade as the proximate factor through which insti-
35:1027:79951:22:22:72:554:526:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tutions operate. There may be other factors that are correlated with trade whose impact on
35:1028:80041:22:21:72:554:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:growth we might attribute to trade. With numerous other possible growth factors, of which
35:1029:80130:21:22:72:554:483:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:there is only a small subset with consistent city-level information for the early 19th century,
35:1030:80225:22:22:72:554:461:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:there is no denitive answer to this question. The focus on trade amounts to a type of exclusion
35:1031:80321:22:27:72:284:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:restriction that cannot directly be tested.
35:1032:80364:27:22:89:553:412:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The evidence we can bring to bear on this question comes mainly from including other
35:1033:80448:22:22:72:554:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:factors into the empirical analysis. Earlier we have shown that the reduced-form impact of
35:1034:80538:22:21:72:554:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:French rule and railway cost on city size does not vanish when we control for the location of
35:1035:80631:21:28:72:550:347:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:coal deposits, the propensity to international trade, or religious beliefs, among other things.33
35:1036:80728:28:22:89:553:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now extend this analysis by including the same factorsZdir ectly into the instrumental

35:1040:81001:21:22:72:554:197:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not have a particular reason to believe, for example, that latitude should a¤ect city growth con-

35:1042:81191:22:27:72:554:153:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:variable approach for a range of factors, we nd virtually no factor having a signicant e¤ects

35:1044:81399:15:12:72:554:111:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:measure does, though by introducing decade xed e¤ects we allow for time-varying e¤ects, which should help
35:1045:81505:12:0:72:205:99:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:F:make the analysis comparable.
36:1046:81536:0:22:72:554:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on city size once trade and institutions are included (see Table C).34This provides additional
36:1047:81630:22:22:72:554:694:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:evidence in support of trade being an important proximate factor through which institutions

36:1049:81734:44:22:89:553:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:A:How does trade lead to growth?Much of what we know about the impact of insti-
36:1050:81811:22:21:72:554:606:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tutions on trade concerns comparative advantage (see Nunn and Treer 2013), which governs
36:1051:81900:21:22:72:554:585:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:which products a country specializes in. In addition, trade can also a¤ect the degree of com-
36:1052:81993:22:22:72:554:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:petition and mark-ups (Levinsohn 1993, Melitz and Ottaviano 2008). One idea of how trade
36:1053:82081:22:21:72:554:541:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:leads to dynamic e¤ects is that it leads to the di¤usion of technological knowledge, which af-
36:1054:82175:21:22:72:554:520:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:fects the rate of innovation (Keller 2002). There are studies relating the extent of so-called
36:1055:82269:22:22:72:554:498:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:R&D spillovers from international trade to domestic institutions (Acharya and Keller 2008,

36:1057:82447:21:22:72:554:455:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of steam railways, which is taken as given, has a¤ected regional patenting in 19th century

36:1059:82563:28:21:89:553:405:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Along these lines we ask whether there is a relation between trade and innovation in

36:1062:82836:25:21:72:554:340:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade? We do not have information on city-level patenting, however data on patenting at the
36:1063:82927:21:22:72:554:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:regional level is available starting in the late 19th century (Baten, Streb, and Yin 2006). Us-
36:1064:83022:22:22:72:554:297:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ing this data, we nd that cities with greater institutional change not only had improvements
36:1065:83115:22:21:72:554:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in trade during the 19th century but also exhibited systematically higher levels of per-capita
36:1066:83209:21:22:72:554:254:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:patenting in the following decades (Figure 10). Moreover, the correlation is, with almost fty
36:1067:83303:22:22:72:554:232:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:percent, quite strong. This is consistent with the hypothesis that one mechanism through which
36:1068:83397:22:27:72:408:210:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade led to growth in our context was higher rates of innovation.

37:1073:83804:33:22:72:553:680:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In the setting of 19th century central Europe, we have examined the link between institutional
37:1074:83898:22:22:72:554:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:change as a fundamental cause of growth, and the more proximate factors, trade and railways.
37:1075:83990:22:21:72:554:636:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Our results conrm that institutions have a strong impact on long-run growth. What is new is
37:1076:84082:21:22:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that we nd trade to be important as a proximate factor in this. In this section we discuss a
37:1077:84175:22:27:72:207:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:number of open questions.
37:1078:84200:27:22:89:553:566:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:First, to what extent are our results driven by the setting of 19th century Germany? In
37:1079:84287:22:21:72:554:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:particular, should we always expect trade to be conducive to growth? Some of our estimates
37:1080:84377:21:22:72:554:523:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:point to heterogeneous e¤ects, although it is di¢cult to tell whether they could be strong enough
37:1081:84474:22:22:72:554:501:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to lead to a core-periphery pattern (requiring positive growth in some, negative growth in other
37:1082:84570:22:21:72:554:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cities). Also, in our context we did not see much evidence that trade a¤ects institutions, but we
37:1083:84667:21:22:72:554:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:know that trade can lead not only to inclusive changes but also to exclusive changes that lower

37:1085:84850:22:26:72:329:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to learn more about the generality of the ndings.
37:1086:84900:26:22:89:553:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We have analyzed trade that, while not quite domestic, is less international than in much of
37:1087:84992:22:22:72:554:366:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the literature. As a general matter, domestic trade may be more important than international
37:1088:85084:22:21:72:554:344:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade for gravity reasons: it happens more frequently. Productive coexistence almost surely
37:1089:85175:21:22:72:554:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:requires the division of labor on a limited geographic space, and therefore domestic trade may be
37:1090:85272:22:22:72:554:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a crucial aspect of that. Trade not only depends on but may also generate another feedback to
37:1091:85365:22:21:72:554:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions through increased trust, networks, the absence of war, and greater cultural identity.
37:1092:85463:21:22:72:554:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:To the extent that this is good for growth, it will be picked up as a strengthening of integration,
37:1093:85562:22:22:72:554:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:explaining in part why we nd trade to be so important as a proximate factor for institutions.
37:1094:85656:22:22:72:554:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:At the same time, there are also strong commonalities between domestic and international
37:1095:85744:22:21:72:554:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trade: for example, both are subject to gravity and so-called border e¤ects (Hillberry and
37:1096:85834:21:22:72:554:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Hummels 2003, Shiue 2005), and the di¤erence between domestic and international trade may
37:1097:85923:22:22:72:554:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:well be more gradual than the domestic versus international distinction suggests. A treatment
37:1098:86016:22:21:72:554:127:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of institutions and culture when trade is possible over various distances, broadly dened, can
37:1099:86110:21:27:72:485:106:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:be found in Tabellini (2008), and further work along these lines would be useful.
37:1100:86191:27:0:89:553:79:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Taking our result that institutions a¤ect growth via trade as given, there is still much to
38:1101:86284:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:learn about the mechanisms. Was it the more credible enforcement of private contracts? A
38:1102:86372:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:gr eater tendency to establish interregional agreements? That private business interests were
38:1103:86465:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:given more room, including in the operation of railways? While we have arguably peeled o¤
38:1104:86554:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:one layer in the understanding of growth, more detailed analysis is needed combined with a
38:1105:86644:22:21:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:suitable framework for quantication to make further progress. Our analysis was limited to
38:1106:86734:21:22:72:554:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:one fundamental, institutions, and one proximate factor, trade.  While we have considered
38:1107:86823:22:22:72:554:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:alternatives, a full-blown study of multiple proximate growth factors would be interesting, even
38:1108:86919:22:21:72:554:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:though estimating causal e¤ects would be without doubt challenging. This paper has tried to
38:1109:87010:21:22:72:554:544:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:suggest a way to include additional steps and testable implications that we hope will prove
38:1110:87101:22:0:72:245:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:useful in future studies of growth.

47:1300:100125:0:33:72:310:713:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:A  Details on Data Sources
47:1301:100151:33:22:72:554:680:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Ci ty populationWe employ two measures of city population size. The rst is based on data
47:1302:100240:22:22:72:554:658:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in the German Historical GIS Kompendium (Kunz 2013a), which gives the population at the
47:1303:100327:22:21:72:554:636:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f4:B:Regierungsbezirklevel (roughly, county level) for all sample areas. For example, in the case of
47:1304:100422:21:22:72:554:615:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Prussian cities of Madgeburg and Aachen, our estimates are based on the o¢cial population
47:1305:100511:22:22:72:553:593:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:gures for theRegierungsbezirkeof Madgeburg and Aachen that were collected every three
47:1306:100597:22:21:72:554:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:years (in 1822, 1825, etc.). Because in each county the main city is the major inuence of
47:1307:100687:21:22:72:554:550:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:population changes, population changes derived from these gures give an accurate estimate of
47:1308:100780:22:28:72:196:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:city population changes.
47:1309:100804:28:21:89:553:500:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:These population trends are combined with information on population levels for the bench-
47:1310:100893:21:22:72:554:479:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mark years of 1800 and 1850, which come from Bairoch, Batou, and Chevre (1988), de Vries
47:1311:100981:22:22:72:554:457:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(1984), and Mitchell (1980) for the larger cities, and from the local population histories and
47:1312:101075:22:21:72:554:435:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other sources for the smaller cities. The city population data for non-benchmark years for some
47:1313:101170:21:22:72:554:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the smallest towns in the sample are our own estimates. Also the city population gures for
47:1314:101264:22:22:72:554:392:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the year 1800 come from these sources, while the population of each state in the year 1816 is
47:1315:101357:22:27:72:214:370:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:taken from Viebahn (1858).
47:1316:101383:27:22:89:553:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:An alternative source of population data is the Städtebuch data from Keyser (1939), various
47:1317:101474:22:22:71:553:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:volumes (employed in specication (10) of Table 10).  Its primary advantage is it provides
47:1318:101564:22:21:71:553:299:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information on the population of cities, as opposed to the counties in which the cities are
47:1319:101655:21:22:71:553:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:located, while its disadvantage is that population gures are given less frequently so more
47:1320:101746:22:22:71:553:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interpolation is necessary. The Städtebuch gures also di¤er in that they generally include any
47:1321:101841:22:21:71:553:234:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:increase in city size due to redistricting. The two city population series are quite similar, with
47:1322:101939:21:22:71:553:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a correlation above 0.99, and we are condent that both series capture the main population
47:1323:102029:22:38:71:240:191:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:developments in the sample well.
47:1324:102061:38:22:71:553:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Wheat PricesThe annual price of wheat in each city is computed from government records
47:1325:102147:22:22:71:553:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of market prices that were typically recorded every month, and in some cases every week. The
47:1326:102239:22:21:71:553:109:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information on cities in Bavaria and Mecklenburg are taken from Shiue and Keller (2007), while
47:1327:102333:21:0:71:553:88:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Seu¤ert (1857) also covers cities in Baden, Brunswick, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-
48:1328:102427:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Nassau, Saxony, and Wurttemberg. The wheat prices for Prussian markets were provided by
48:1329:102514:22:21:72:553:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Mi  chael Kopsidis, see Kopsidis (2002). In a temporal dimension, the extent of wheat price
48:1330:102605:21:22:72:554:674:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information varies by city. We have expanded the coverage of the wheat price data using the
48:1331:102696:22:22:72:554:652:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:additional sources, in particular Fremdling and Hohorst (1979), Gerhard and Kaufhold (1990),
48:1332:102788:22:21:72:554:630:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and Vierteljahrshefte (1935). While our sample covers virtually all German areas, Bavaria and
48:1333:102881:21:22:72:554:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Mecklenburg are particularly well represented (see Figure 2). In Table 5 we show that reducing
48:1334:102975:22:22:72:554:587:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the inuence from cities of these polities does not critically inuence our results.  General
48:1335:103068:22:27:72:550:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics of the grain prices during this period are discussed in Shiue and Keller (2007).
48:1336:103164:27:22:89:553:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The price gap sample consists of all city pairs for which we have wheat price information
48:1337:103253:22:22:71:553:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for both cities. Since neither quantity nor monetary units were standardized in the German
48:1338:103343:22:21:71:553:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:states during the 19th century, conversion rates are required for our analysis of absolute price
48:1339:103439:21:22:71:553:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:di¤erences, and all prices are converted into BavarianGuldenper BavarianSchä¤el.  The
48:1340:103524:22:22:71:553:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:conversion factors are taken from the original sources (see Shiue and Keller 2007 for references)
48:1341:103621:22:62:71:480:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as well as from Seu¤ert (1857). Specically, from the latter we have (page 351):

49:1367:104407:21:22:72:554:614:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:existed but it was highly circuitous.  At other times, a train connection from a city in the

49:1369:104591:22:21:72:554:570:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:back south (and analogously for east-west railway lines). In these cases there is considerable
49:1370:104685:21:22:72:554:549:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:doubt that the route was indeed the least-cost route, and we assume in these cases that train

49:1392:105747:22:22:72:554:105:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is assumed that the freight capacity of locomotives varied for downhill trips (due to strains on

50:1399:106372:21:22:71:553:609:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this cost function in hand we use a 90 meter x 90 meter GIS map of the relevant area in central

50:1408:107132:44:22:72:553:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Institutional Change and French RuleThe data on institutional change in the forty
50:1409:107213:22:21:72:554:369:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:German cities is based on Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (ACJR; 2011).  To
50:1410:107297:21:22:72:554:348:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the extent that our analysis covers areas that are not included in their sample, we use the
50:1411:107388:22:22:72:554:326:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sources given in ACJR, especially Dipper (1980). We dene institutions at the city level as the
50:1412:107483:22:21:72:554:304:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutions that prevailed in the geographic area of the city. Note that while for the most part
50:1413:107580:21:22:72:554:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the measures of institutional changeabolition of guilds and equality before the lawvary at the
50:1414:107676:22:22:72:554:261:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:state level, for some of the larger states such as Prussia and Bavaria there is also variation at
50:1415:107773:22:27:72:173:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the level of the city.
50:1416:107795:27:22:89:553:212:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:There are some di¤erences in the way we employ this data. First, we employ three indicators
50:1417:107886:22:22:72:554:190:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of institutions: (1) abolition of guilds, (2) equality before the law, and (3) the redeemability of
50:1418:107985:22:21:72:553:168:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:feudal lands, while ACJR employ a fourth, thede jureabolition of serfdom. This indicator does
50:1419:108078:21:22:72:554:147:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not play a big role here. Further, in our analysis we compute the average of the 0/1 indicators
50:1420:108173:22:22:72:554:125:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that indicate the presence or absence of this aspect of the institutions, which varies over time
50:1421:108269:22:21:72:554:103:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to the extent that the indicators vary over time. In ACJR the authors dene their institutional
50:1422:108364:21:0:72:554:82:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:indicator as the number of years that the institutional indicators were in place by a given year
51:1423:108462:0:22:72:554:717:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f4:B:t. As a consequence, we capture primarily the contemporaneous e¤ect while ACJR model a
51:1424:108548:22:27:72:191:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mo  re cumulative e¤ect.
51:1425:108572:27:22:89:553:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our data on the length of French rule follows ACJR closely. The criterion for this variable
51:1426:108663:22:22:72:554:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is e¤ective French rule, which is more than purely military occupation. A special case in this
51:1427:108757:22:21:72:554:624:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:respect are the former Hanse cities: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck. In the main results, we
51:1428:108846:21:22:72:554:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:code these cities as not French-ruled, even though they actually were Frenchdepartementsfrom

51:1430:109027:22:21:72:554:559:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the continental blockade versus England, which was not only by its nature detrimental to trade
51:1431:109121:21:22:72:554:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:but also just di¤erent from French rule in other parts of the sample. Second, French rule in the
51:1432:109217:22:22:72:554:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Hanse cities was more tenuous than in other areas; during part of the year 1812, for example,
51:1433:109310:22:21:72:554:494:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Hamburg was ruled by the Russians. We also show in Table 10 that the main results do not
51:1434:109398:21:28:72:371:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:depend on our treatment of the Hanse cities (column (9)).
