2:27:1169:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Public pension funding has recently become a front-burner policy issue in the wake of the financial
2:28:1268:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:crisis and given the pending retirement of large numbers of baby boomers. This paper examines the
2:29:1365:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:current funding of state and local pensions using a sample of 126 plans, estimating an aggregate funded
2:30:1468:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:ratio in 2009 of 78 percent. Projections for 2010-2013 suggest that some continued deterioration is
2:31:1567:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:likely. Funded status can vary significantly among plans, so the paper explores the influence of four
2:32:1668:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:types of factors: funding discipline, plan governance, plan characteristics, and the fiscal situation of
2:33:1772:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:the state. Judging the adequacy of funding requires more than just a snapshot of assets and liabilities,
2:34:1876:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:so the paper examines how well plans are meeting their Annual Required Contribution and what factors
2:35:1976:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:influence whether they make them. The paper also addresses the controversy over what discount rate
2:36:2074:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:to use for valuing liabilities, concluding that using a riskless rate of return could help improve funding
2:37:2180:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:discipline but would need to be implemented in a manageable way. Finally, the paper assesses whether
2:38:2280:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:plans face a near-term liquidity crisis and finds that most have assets on hand to cover benefits over
2:39:2382:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:the next 15-20 years. The bottom line is that, like private investors, public plans have been hit hard
2:40:2484:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:by the financial crisis and their full recovery is dependent on the rebound of the economy and the stock
2:41:2588:14:42:72:108:392:12:Times:12:Times:market.

3:56:2893:0:13:72:143:708:144:Times:144:Times:Introduction  
3:57:2907:13:14:72:75:695:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:58:2907:14:14:72:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:It is generally agreed that each generation of taxpayers should pay the full cost of the public 
3:59:3003:14:13:72:529:667:144:Times:144:Times:services it receives.  If a worker’s compensation includes a defined benefit pension, the cost of 
3:60:3101:13:14:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:the benefit earned in that year should be recognized, and funded, at the time the worker performs 
3:61:3199:14:14:72:539:640:144:Times:144:Times:that service, not when the pension is paid in retirement.  The discipline of making state and local 
3:62:3299:14:14:72:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:governments pay the annual costs also discourages governments from awarding excessively 
3:63:3387:14:55:72:284:612:144:Times:65:Times:generous pensions in lieu of current wages.1
3:64:3431:55:0:72:75:557:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:65:3431:0:14:284:542:612:144:Times:144:Times:  Many states and localities also have some unfunded 
3:66:3484:14:13:72:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:pension obligations from the past, either because they did not put away money at the time the 
3:67:3578:13:14:72:530:585:144:Times:144:Times:benefits were earned or because they provided benefits retroactively to some participants.  The 
3:68:3674:14:28:72:500:571:144:Times:144:Times:cost of these unfunded liabilities also needs to be distributed in some equitable fashion.   
3:69:3767:28:14:72:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:The question of funding has gained increased urgency for two reasons.  First, the collapse of the 
3:70:3865:14:13:72:514:529:144:Times:144:Times:stock market reduced the value of equities held by state and local plans by about $1 trillion, 
3:71:3960:13:14:72:529:516:144:Times:144:Times:substantially undermining the funded status of virtually all state and local plans.  Second, baby 
3:72:4058:14:14:72:519:502:144:Times:144:Times:boomers are about to begin retiring in large numbers, which means that benefits are slated to 
3:73:4152:14:14:72:183:488:144:Times:144:Times:increase sharply.          
3:74:4179:14:14:72:75:474:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:75:4179:14:13:72:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:This paper examines the current funding of state and local pension plans.  Section 1 begins by 
3:76:4274:13:14:72:542:447:144:Times:144:Times:describing the regulatory environment under which the plans operate, and Section 2 describes the 
3:77:4371:14:14:72:527:433:144:Times:144:Times:actuarial cost methods employed.  Section 3 then reports the funding status of the 126 plans in 
3:78:4467:14:14:72:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:our sample as of 2009 – the first year for which the full impact of the financial meltdown is felt, 
3:79:4567:14:14:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:and Section 4 reports on factors affecting the variability in funded ratios.  Judging the adequacy 
3:80:4666:14:13:72:529:391:144:Times:144:Times:of funding, however, requires more than a snapshot of the ratio of assets to liabilities; t  he key 
3:81:4766:13:14:71:534:378:144:Times:144:Times:issue is whether the sponsor has a funding plan and is sticking to it.  So Section 5 reports on the 
3:82:4866:14:14:72:524:364:144:Times:144:Times:extent to which plan sponsors are making their Annual Required Contribution (ARC), tries to 
3:83:4958:14:14:72:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:identify the factors that lead sponsors to make their ARC payment, and speculates about the 
3:84:5050:14:14:72:534:336:144:Times:144:Times:future of ARC payments.  Section 6 looks at how the funding picture would change if liabilities 
3:85:5146:14:13:72:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:were valued using the riskless rate rather than the return on assets.  Finally, Section 7 addresses 
3:86:5246:13:14:71:194:309:144:Times:65:Times:the question of liquidity.2
3:87:5273:14:0:72:75:295:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:88:5273:0:28:194:206:309:144:Times:144:Times:    
3:89:5277:28:14:72:537:281:144:Times:144:Times:The conclusion that emerges is that, despite not having a federal mandate, in the aggregate, state 
3:90:5376:14:14:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:and local plans were making solid progress toward funding until they were thrown severely off 
3:91:5470:14:14:72:515:253:144:Times:144:Times:course by the bursting of the dot.com bubble and the collapse of asset prices in 2008.  Their 
3:92:5564:14:13:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:funded status looks much worse, of course, if assets are valued using the riskless rate.  They are 
3:93:5663:13:14:72:529:226:144:Times:144:Times:not, however, facing a liquidity crisis; on average, plans have enough assets to pay benefits for 
3:94:5761:14:14:72:489:212:144:Times:144:Times:the next 15-20 years.  Most states have responded to the crisis by increasing employee 
3:95:5848:14:14:72:502:198:144:Times:144:Times:contributions and reducing benefits for new employees.  But the picture will not improve 
3:96:5937:14:14:72:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:significantly until the economy and the stock market recover and states and localities resume 
3:97:6031:14:26:72:189:170:144:Times:144:Times:paying their full ARC.

3:99:6114:8:16:72:541:136:42:Times:99:Times:1 Johnson (1997) found that the relative generosity of pensions among state and local government workers is directly 
3:100:6231:16:7:72:260:120:99:Times:99:Times:related to the ability to underfund their plans.   
3:101:6281:7:16:72:537:113:42:Times:99:Times:2 This paper is based on a body of research conducted by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and

4:106:6664:13:14:72:238:695:144:Times:144:Times:1. The Regulatory Environment

4:108:6694:14:13:72:524:667:144:Times:144:Times:Funding is a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector.  Public plans were not in very 
4:109:6789:13:14:72:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:good shape as recently as the late 1970s.  State and local government employment had roughly 
4:110:6882:14:14:72:541:640:144:Times:144:Times:doubled between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, resulting in an enormous growth in workers 
4:111:6976:14:14:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:participating in state and local pensions.  Nevertheless, primarily for constitutional reasons, 
4:112:7072:14:41:72:506:612:144:Times:65:Times:public plans were not covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.3

4:115:7161:14:13:72:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:ERISA did mandate a study of these plans, and the conclusions of the 1978 Pension Task Force 
4:116:7254:13:28:72:407:585:144:Times:144:Times:Report on Public Employee Retirement Systems were not flattering:    
4:117:7323:28:14:72:529:557:144:Times:144:Times: “In the vast majority of public employee pension systems, plan participants, plan sponsors, 
4:118:7415:14:14:90:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:and the general public are kept in the dark with regard to a realistic assessment of true 
4:119:7505:14:13:90:510:529:144:Times:144:Times:pension costs.  The high degree of pension cost blindness is due to the lack of actuarial 
4:120:7595:13:14:90:532:516:144:Times:144:Times:valuations, the use of unrealistic actuarial assumptions, and the general absence of actuarial 
4:121:7690:14:14:90:146:502:144:Times:144:Times:standards.” 
4:122:7701:14:14:71:74:488:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:123:7701:14:14:71:531:474:144:Times:144:Times:Perhaps at least partly in response to the report, states and localities became increasingly aware 
4:124:7800:14:13:71:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:of the importance of sound funding and began to undertake a variety of approaches to achieve 
4:125:7893:13:14:71:535:447:144:Times:144:Times:that goal.  These funding efforts and a strong stock market produced a marked increase in assets 
4:126:7990:14:13:71:204:433:144:Times:99:g_d0_f3:per worker (see Figure 1).

4:128:8018:13:14:72:512:407:144:Times:144:Times:The accounting organizations also played a role.  The Governmental Accounting Standards 
4:129:8106:14:14:72:528:393:144:Times:144:Times:Board (GASB), which came into being in the early 1980s, provided guidance for disclosure of 
4:130:8198:14:109:72:320:379:144:Times:65:Times:pension information with Statement No. 5 in 1986.4
4:131:8248:109:0:72:74:270:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3: 
4:132:8248:0:14:320:517:379:144:Times:144:Times:  One important requirement was that all 
4:133:8289:14:13:72:522:365:144:Times:144:Times:plans report their benefit obligations and pension fund assets using uniform methods to allow 
4:134:8383:13:14:72:530:352:144:Times:144:Times:observers to make comparisons across plans.  In most cases, this required two sets of books, as 
4:135:8479:14:14:72:519:338:144:Times:144:Times:the GASB method was very different from the approach most plan actuaries had adopted for 
4:136:8568:14:14:72:534:324:144:Times:144:Times:establishing funding contributions.  What’s more, actuaries did not apply it retroactively, which 
4:137:8666:14:14:72:522:310:144:Times:144:Times:made historical comparisons impossible.  As a result, when users needed information about a 
4:138:8758:14:13:72:524:296:144:Times:144:Times:plan’s funded status and funding progress, they generally looked to numbers generated by the 
4:139:8851:13:26:72:202:283:144:Times:99:g_d0_f3:plan’s own methodology.   
4:140:8876:26:14:72:517:257:144:Times:144:Times:GASB Statements No. 25 and 275, issued in 1994, contained a key innovation: they allowed 
4:141:8965:14:14:72:518:243:144:Times:144:Times:sponsors that satisfy certain “parameters” to use the numbers that emerge from the actuary’s 
4:142:9058:14:14:72:268:229:144:Times:65:Times:funding exercise for reporting purposes.6

4:145:9273:17:12:72:508:189:99:Times:99:Times:establish legal claims to benefits, and funding and fiduciary standards to make sure that the money would be 
4:146:9382:12:11:72:541:177:99:Times:99:Times:available to pay the legal benefit claims.  To further protect participants against the possibility that some plans might 
4:147:9504:11:11:72:522:166:99:Times:99:Times:terminate with inadequate assets, typically due to the failure of the sponsor, ERISA also established the Pension

4:155:10151:7:16:72:531:90:42:Times:99:Times:6This arrangement is very different from what occurs in the private sector, where the actuary is required to make a 
4:156:10267:16:0:72:505:74:99:Times:99:Times:number of valuations for different purposes.  In the private sector, the actuary must produce: 1) a traditional 
5:157:10381:0:14:72:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:amortization period, which was originally up to 40 years and reduced to 30 years in 2006, and an 
5:158:10478:14:14:72:524:695:144:Times:144:Times:Annual Required Contribution (ARC), which would cover the cost of benefits accruing in the 
5:159:10569:14:14:72:450:681:144:Times:65:Times:current year and a payment to amortize the plan’s unfunded actuarial liability.7

5:162:10651:33:14:72:536:654:144:Times:144:Times:For measuring the funded status of a plan, GASB uses the projected benefit obligation (PBO) as 
5:163:10746:14:14:72:517:640:144:Times:144:Times:the liability concept.  The PBO includes pension benefits paid to retired employees, benefits 
5:164:10840:14:14:72:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:earned to date by active employees based on their current salaries and years of service, and the 
5:165:10937:14:14:72:535:612:144:Times:144:Times:effect of future salary increases on the value of pension rights already earned by active workers. 
5:166:11036:14:13:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:With regard to the discount rate, GASB 25 states that it should be based on “an estimated long-
5:167:11131:13:14:72:523:585:144:Times:144:Times:term yield for the plan, with consideration given to the nature and mix of current and planned 
5:168:11226:14:14:72:153:571:144:Times:144:Times:investments ...”

5:170:11243:14:14:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:GASB provides the parameters, but plans are not required to follow them.  GASB, like its private 
5:171:11340:14:13:72:524:529:144:Times:144:Times:sector counterpart, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, is an independent organization 
5:172:11433:13:14:72:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:and has no authority to enforce its recommendations.  Many state laws, however, require that 
5:173:11526:14:14:72:501:502:144:Times:144:Times:public plans comply with GASB standards, and auditors generally require state and local 
5:174:11614:14:14:72:529:488:144:Times:144:Times:governments to comply with the standards to receive a “clean” audit opinion.  And bond raters 
5:175:11708:14:27:72:506:474:144:Times:65:Times:generally consider whether GASB standards are followed when assessing credit standing.8

5:177:11795:0:14:506:542:474:144:Times:144:Times:  Thus, 
5:178:11803:14:28:72:430:460:144:Times:144:Times:financial reporting requirements probably have had considerable impact.

5:181:11926:14:14:72:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:The precise amount of money that state and local plans put aside each year depends on how the 
5:182:12020:14:13:72:512:391:144:Times:144:Times:actuaries allocate costs to a particular year – that is, it depends on the actuarial cost method 
5:183:12117:13:14:72:514:378:144:Times:144:Times:adopted.  In contrast to the private sector, the public sector relies primarily on the entry-age 
5:184:12214:14:25:72:396:364:144:Times:65:Times:normal approach for funding and reporting purposes (see Table 1).9

5:186:12466:12:12:72:531:327:99:Times:99:Times:actuarial valuation to determine funding, which presents the actuary’s best estimate of the plan’s liabilities, assets, 
5:187:12586:12:11:72:529:315:99:Times:99:Times:the annual contribution required to cover benefits accrued that year (the normal cost), and the amortization of any 
5:188:12702:11:11:72:538:304:99:Times:99:Times:unfunded obligations, all assuming the plan will continue indefinitely; 2) a valuation as stipulated by the accounting 
5:189:12821:11:12:72:538:293:99:Times:99:Times:profession for reporting purposes that again determines assets, liabilities, and the sponsor’s annual pension expense, 
5:190:12940:12:12:72:537:281:99:Times:99:Times:to be reported on the financial statements of the sponsor and the plan; and 3) a determination of the plan’s “current” 
5:191:13059:12:11:72:524:269:99:Times:99:Times:funding status for compliance purposes to determine minimum and maximum contributions and Pension Benefit 
5:192:13165:11:12:72:531:258:99:Times:99:Times:Guaranty Corporation insurance premiums.   While actuaries attempt to keep assumptions as consistent as possible 
5:193:13278:12:11:72:541:246:99:Times:99:Times:across these valuations, the discount rates used to value future obligations, a critical variable, can differ considerably

5:197:13557:16:7:72:382:212:99:Times:99:Times:created by benefit increases attributed to “past service” or experience losses.

5:199:13686:11:17:72:525:194:42:Times:99:Times:9 Both public and private sector employers had traditionally used the entry-age normal actuarial costing method.  
5:200:13800:17:11:71:525:177:99:Times:99:Times:The reason for the shift in the private sector is that, in 1985, FASB issued rules requiring sponsors to account for 
5:201:13917:11:11:71:507:166:99:Times:99:Times:accruing pension liabilities by a uniform method, which was the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.  
5:202:14027:11:12:71:539:155:99:Times:99:Times:Technically, FASB mandated the projected unit credit method only for reporting purposes, and firms could continue 
5:203:14141:12:12:71:524:143:99:Times:99:Times:to use any of the six actuarial methods authorized under ERISA for funding.  Sponsors, however, appear to have 
5:204:14252:12:11:71:534:131:99:Times:99:Times:either interpreted the FASB standard as an endorsement of the projected unit credit for funding as well as reporting 
5:205:14369:11:12:71:521:120:99:Times:99:Times:or simply found it more convenient to use the same method for funding and reporting.  As a result, a major shift 
5:206:14482:12:11:71:523:108:99:Times:99:Times:occurred from entry-age normal to projected unit credit for funding purposes (see Table at bottom of next page).

6:210:14597:0:14:72:514:709:144:Times:144:Times:projected unit credit and 16 percent the aggregate cost or other method.  The aggregate cost 
6:211:14690:14:14:72:531:695:144:Times:144:Times:method allocates unfunded liabilities as future normal costs, so a plan using this method shows 
6:212:14786:14:14:72:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:no current unfunded liabilities and a 100-percent funded ratio.  GASB now requires plans using 
6:213:14881:14:13:71:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate cost to also report their funding using entry-age normal and, using this method, the 
6:214:14976:13:14:71:419:654:144:Times:144:Times:aggregate cost plans turn out to be about average in terms of funding.     
6:215:15051:14:14:71:77:640:144:Times:144:Times:  
6:216:15053:14:14:71:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:Both the entry-age normal and projected unit credit generate conventional funded ratios.  A 
6:217:15145:14:14:71:528:612:144:Times:144:Times:numerical example may help clarify a key difference between the costing methods.  Suppose a 
6:218:15237:14:13:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:plan sponsor needs to contribute $15,000 for a particular employee who will retire in five years, 
6:219:15335:13:14:71:538:585:144:Times:144:Times:and that the sponsor fully funds the cost specified by either method.  Under projected unit credit, 
6:220:15435:14:14:71:538:571:144:Times:144:Times:the sponsor recognizes and funds, say, $1,000 in the first year, $2,000 in the second year, $3,000 
6:221:15534:14:14:71:540:557:144:Times:144:Times:in the third year, $4,000 in the fourth year, and $5,000 in the fifth year.  Under entry-age normal, 
6:222:15635:14:14:71:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:the actuary would level the contributions over the five-year period so that the sponsor would 
6:223:15729:14:13:71:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:recognize and pay a normal cost of $3,000 per year.  Had the sponsor used entry-age normal, 
6:224:15821:13:14:71:531:516:144:Times:144:Times:after three years, the plan would have an actuarial accumulated liability of $9,000 and assets of 
6:225:15919:14:14:71:500:502:144:Times:144:Times:$9,000 (see Figure 2).  Had the sponsor used projected unit credit, the plan would have a 
6:226:16009:14:14:71:326:488:144:Times:144:Times:cumulative liability of $6,000 and assets of $6,000.   
6:227:16064:14:14:71:74:474:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:228:16064:14:13:71:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:In other words, up to the point of retirement, the entry-age method recognizes a larger 
6:229:16152:13:14:71:534:447:144:Times:144:Times:accumulated pension obligation for active employees and requires a larger contribution than the 
6:230:16248:14:14:71:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:projected unit credit.  Thus, given comparable funded ratios, plans using the entry-age normal 
6:231:16343:14:14:71:508:419:144:Times:144:Times:method have recognized more liabilities and accumulated more assets than those using the 
6:232:16432:14:14:71:467:405:144:Times:65:Times:projected unit credit, which is the dominant costing method in the private sector.10

6:237:16556:13:14:72:531:350:144:Times:144:Times:GASB requires plan sponsors to report the funded status of their plans at least every two years; 
6:238:16653:14:14:72:538:336:144:Times:144:Times:most do so annually.  These reported numbers for our sample of 126 plans over the period 1994- 
6:239:16748:14:13:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:2008 and our estimates for 2009 are presented in Figure 3.  From the mid-1990s to 2000, funding 
6:240:16844:13:14:72:530:309:144:Times:144:Times:improved markedly in response to GASB guidelines and a rising stock market.  In 2000, assets 
6:241:16937:14:14:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:amounted to 104 percent of liabilities.  With the bursting of the high-tech bubble at the turn of 
6:242:17035:14:30:72:536:281:144:Times:144:Times:the century, funding levels dropped as years of low asset values replaced the higher values from

6:254:17779:18:11:71:513:131:99:Times:99:Times:during the 1980s and 1990s when the baby boom generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) were young 
6:255:17882:11:12:71:521:120:99:Times:99:Times:workers (age 20 to 50) and shifted pension expense (and contributions) for this very large cohort to later in their 
6:256:17998:12:11:71:518:108:99:Times:99:Times:careers.  Now that the baby boomers are approaching retirement, funding requirements will be higher than they 
6:257:18108:11:11:71:540:97:99:Times:99:Times:would have been under the entry-age normal cost method.  The public sector, in contrast, faces a steady contribution

7:261:18330:14:14:71:470:695:144:Times:144:Times:the collapse of asset values in 2008 has once again led to declining funded ratios.

7:263:18416:14:13:71:535:667:144:Times:144:Times:The magnitude of that decline depends on the accuracy of our 2009 estimates.  Of the 126 plans 
7:264:18511:13:14:72:514:654:144:Times:144:Times:in our sample, 72 had reported their 2009 funding levels by mid-July 2010.  For those plans 
7:265:18603:14:14:72:503:640:144:Times:144:Times:without valuations, we projected assets on a plan-by-plan basis using the detailed process 
7:266:18694:14:14:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:described in the valuations.11  Applying our methodology retrospectively produced numbers for 
7:267:18788:14:14:71:536:612:144:Times:144:Times:previous years that perfectly match published asset values in half the cases and that came within 
7:268:18886:14:13:71:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:1 percent in the other half.12  We projected liabilities based on the average rate of growth over 
7:269:18984:13:14:72:532:585:144:Times:144:Times:the past four years.  We then sent our proposed projections to the plan administrators and made 
7:270:19080:14:42:72:204:571:144:Times:65:Times:any suggested alterations.13

7:272:19110:0:14:204:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:  This process resulted in a complete set of plan funded ratios for 
7:273:19178:14:14:72:530:557:144:Times:144:Times:fiscal year 2009.  Based on those numbers, the aggregate funded ratio dropped from 84 percent 
7:274:19272:14:27:72:225:543:144:Times:144:Times:in 2008 to 78 percent in 2009.   
7:275:19305:27:15:72:202:516:144:Times:144:Times:Projections for 2010-2013 
7:276:19331:15:13:72:75:501:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:277:19331:13:14:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:While funded ratios for 2009 were the lowest they have been in 15 years, reported numbers are 
7:278:19425:14:14:71:532:474:144:Times:144:Times:likely to decline further over 2010-2013 as gains in the years leading up to 2007 are phased out 
7:279:19522:14:14:71:502:460:144:Times:144:Times:and losses from the market collapse phased in.  The precise pattern of future funding will 
7:280:19613:14:13:72:487:446:144:Times:144:Times:depend, of course, on what happens to the stock market.  To address such uncertainty, 
7:281:19699:13:14:72:528:433:144:Times:144:Times:projections were made using three sets of assumptions for the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index 
7:282:19791:14:14:72:494:419:144:Times:144:Times:between now and 2013 (see Figure 4).  All projections assume 3-percent inflation.  The 
7:283:19878:14:14:72:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:pessimistic projection assumes negligible economic growth, rising unemployment, profits 
7:284:19966:14:14:72:539:391:144:Times:144:Times:growing at only 3 percent annually, falling price-earnings ratios, and the stock market remaining 
7:285:20064:14:13:72:493:377:144:Times:144:Times:at its current level of roughly 12,000.  The most likely projection assumes an economic 
7:286:20152:13:14:72:540:364:144:Times:144:Times:expansion sufficient to reduce unemployment slightly, profits growing at 7 percent annually, and 
7:287:20249:14:14:72:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:stock prices rising about 6 percent annually to produce a Wilshire 5000 of 15,000 by 2013.  The 
7:288:20345:14:14:72:505:336:144:Times:144:Times:optimistic projection assumes a stronger economic expansion that reduces unemployment 
7:289:20431:14:14:72:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:significantly and allows profits and stock prices to grow nearly 11 percent annually, so the 
7:290:20524:14:13:72:514:308:144:Times:144:Times:Wilshire 5000 reaches 18,000 by 2013.  The optimistic projection is designed to exceed the 
7:291:20615:13:14:72:441:295:144:Times:144:Times:central projection to the same extent that the central exceeds the pessimistic.

7:297:20991:7:17:72:509:217:42:Times:99:Times:11 For those plans without published 2009 actuarial valuations, we took the percent change in actuarial assets 
7:298:21102:17:11:71:506:200:99:Times:99:Times:between 2008 and 2009, calculated according to the plan’s own methodology, and applied that change to its

7:300:21254:0:58:298:523:240:144:Times:144:Times:   Because, historically, contribution payments 
7:301:21302:58:16:72:535:182:42:Times:99:Times:12 We are less proud of our calculations for the following six plans: Louisiana SERS and TRS, Tennessee State and 
7:302:21416:16:11:71:541:166:99:Times:99:Times:Teachers, Tennessee Political Subdivisions, Minneapolis ERF, and Denver Employees.  In these cases, our estimates 
7:303:21530:11:12:71:532:155:99:Times:99:Times:fall within a 10-percent confidence interval.  However, these are relatively small plans and have a negligible effect 
7:304:21648:12:7:71:187:143:99:Times:99:Times:on aggregate funding levels. 
7:305:21676:7:16:72:534:136:42:Times:99:Times:13 A few plans declined to comment for various reasons.  Connecticut SERS’ valuation schedule does not include a 
7:306:21789:16:12:72:531:120:99:Times:99:Times:2009 report, and CalPERS and Colorado PERA do not yet have 2009 numbers.  Connecticut Teachers, which also 
7:307:21896:12:11:72:78:108:99:Times:42:Times:did not have 2009 numbers, emphasized that it did not want our numbers interpreted as official in any way.   14

8:313:22341:14:14:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:2007).  Benefit payments, which also show little variation over time, are estimated in the same 
8:314:22437:14:13:72:199:667:144:Times:144:Times:manner as contributions.

8:316:22464:14:14:72:539:640:144:Times:144:Times:The results are shown in Figure 5.  Certainly, the more distant the year, the more uncertain is the 
8:317:22564:14:14:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:projection.  In all likelihood, assuming any changes to benefits or contributions would have no 
8:318:22660:14:13:72:521:612:144:Times:144:Times:material effect, 2010 actuarial reports will show assets equal to about 77 percent of promised 
8:319:22755:13:14:72:530:599:144:Times:144:Times:benefits.  What happens thereafter depends increasingly on the future performance of the stock 
8:320:22850:14:14:72:526:585:144:Times:144:Times:market.  Under the most likely scenario, the funded ratio will continue to decline as the strong 
8:321:22947:14:14:71:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:stock market experienced in 2005, 2006, 2007, and much of 2008 is slowly phased out of the 
8:322:23038:14:14:71:508:557:144:Times:144:Times:calculation.  By 2013, the ratio of assets to liabilities is projected to equal 73 percent.  The 
8:323:23135:14:13:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:comparable 2013 ratio for the optimistic scenario is 76 percent and for the pessimistic scenario

8:334:23505:13:14:72:536:394:144:Times:144:Times:In 2009, as in earlier years, funding levels vary substantially.  Figure 7 shows the distribution of 
8:335:23606:14:14:72:535:380:144:Times:144:Times:funding for our sample of plans.  Fifty-seven percent of plans had funding below the 80-percent 
8:336:23702:14:14:72:530:366:144:Times:144:Times:level.  Although many of the poorly funded plans are relatively small, several large plans, such 
8:337:23799:14:14:72:521:352:144:Times:144:Times:as those in Illinois (SERS, Teachers, and Universities) and Connecticut (SERS), had funding 
8:338:23891:14:13:72:198:338:144:Times:144:Times:levels below 60 percent.

8:342:23958:14:14:72:538:283:144:Times:144:Times:In order to ascertain why some governments have fairly well-funded plans and others do not, we 
8:343:24053:14:13:72:544:269:144:Times:144:Times:estimate a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that includes   four categories of factors 
8:344:24154:13:14:72:488:256:144:Times:144:Times:that could affect the funding status: funding discipline, the governance of the plan, the 
8:345:24244:14:14:72:364:242:144:Times:65:Times:characteristics of the plan, and the fiscal health of the state.15

8:348:24313:28:13:72:503:214:144:Times:144:Times:Funding discipline: The funded status of pension plans depends on how much money the 
8:349:24398:13:14:72:531:201:144:Times:144:Times:government and its employees are required to contribute and whether the government has been 
8:350:24490:14:14:72:274:187:144:Times:144:Times:making its annual required contribution.

8:352:24533:15:14:90:534:158:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:• Actuarial cost method. The choice of actuarial cost method may be related to the funded 
8:353:24621:14:13:108:525:144:144:Times:144:Times:status of the plan.  As noted earlier, up to the point of retirement, the entry-age normal 
8:354:24712:13:14:108:535:131:144:Times:144:Times:(EAN) method recognizes a larger accumulated pension obligation for active employees 
8:355:24797:14:19:108:517:117:144:Times:144:Times:than the projected unit credit (PUC) method.  Given comparable funded ratios, plans 
8:356:24881:19:8:72:218:98:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:                                                           
8:357:24939:8:16:72:504:90:42:Times:99:Times:15 One might think that asset allocation might be important, but the variable “percent in equities” was never 
8:358:25049:16:0:71:365:74:99:Times:99:Times:statistically significant in any of the equations estimated for our analysis. 
9:359:25128:0:14:108:527:709:144:Times:144:Times:using the EAN method would have accumulated more assets than those using the PUC 
9:360:25209:14:14:108:535:695:144:Times:144:Times:method.  Therefore, the EAN method is a more stringent funding program.  Of course, if 
9:361:25296:14:14:108:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:plans start with no initial unfunded liability and are following their funding schedules, the 
9:362:25390:14:13:108:533:667:144:Times:144:Times:choice of cost method should not matter – both would have a ratio of assets to liabilities 
9:363:25481:13:14:108:529:654:144:Times:144:Times:of 100 percent.  But our hypothesis is that sponsors that opted for the currently cheaper 
9:364:25571:14:14:108:526:640:144:Times:144:Times:funding regime – namely, the projected unit credit – may be less committed to funding 
9:365:25657:14:14:108:424:626:144:Times:144:Times:their plans and therefore will have lower reported funded ratios.

9:367:25725:15:13:90:502:597:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:• Making contributions. The other consideration, regardless of the actuarial method 
9:368:25808:13:14:108:531:584:144:Times:144:Times:selected, is whether sponsors are actually making the required contributions.  GASB 27 
9:369:25895:14:14:108:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:defines the ARC as the employer’s share of the normal cost (the portion not covered by 
9:370:25982:14:14:108:522:556:144:Times:144:Times:employee contributions) and any payment required to amortize an unfunded liability.  
9:371:26067:14:41:108:406:542:144:Times:65:Times:Sponsors are required to report the percent of the ARC paid.16
9:372:26129:41:0:72:75:501:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:373:26129:0:14:406:526:542:144:Times:144:Times:  Sponsors that make the 
9:374:26154:14:13:108:530:528:144:Times:144:Times:annual required contribution should have plans that are better funded than those that do 
9:375:26243:13:28:108:138:515:144:Times:144:Times:not.    
9:376:26251:28:14:72:518:487:144:Times:144:Times:Governance. Several studies have explored the effect of governance on the funding status of 
9:377:26343:14:41:72:182:473:144:Times:65:Times:public pension plans.17
9:378:26366:41:0:72:75:432:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:379:26366:0:14:182:540:473:144:Times:144:Times:  Based on this earlier research, two variables that might have an effect on 
9:380:26443:14:13:72:525:459:144:Times:144:Times:the funding status of pension plans are the presence of employees and/or retirees on the board 
9:381:26538:13:29:72:385:446:144:Times:144:Times:that governs the plan and the existence of an investment council. 
9:382:26604:29:14:92:542:417:144:g_d0_f5:144:Times:• Employees/retirees on the board.  Pension boards can influence a plan’s actuarial method 
9:383:26694:14:13:110:526:403:144:Times:144:Times:and its investment policy.  If a lot of current workers and retirees are on the board and 
9:384:26784:13:14:110:530:390:144:Times:144:Times:they are more interested in benefit expansion or greater cost-of-living adjustments than 
9:385:26873:14:14:110:541:376:144:Times:144:Times:in funding benefit promises, the plan is likely to have accumulated fewer assets.  Also, to 
9:386:26965:14:14:110:525:362:144:Times:144:Times:the extent that plan beneficiaries are not financial experts, plan assets may not be well 
9:387:27055:14:14:110:530:348:144:Times:144:Times:invested.  In the following analysis, board composition is represented by the percent of 
9:388:27144:14:13:110:525:334:144:Times:144:Times:board seats occupied by retirees and employees.  Although earlier studies have shown 
9:389:27229:13:14:110:514:321:144:Times:144:Times:mixed results, we expected the effect of the number of retirees and employees to be 
9:390:27313:14:14:110:162:307:144:Times:65:Times:negative.18

9:394:27414:13:14:110:504:265:144:Times:144:Times:opposite.  If a plan has a dedicated investment board or hires financial advisors in 
9:395:27499:14:14:110:533:251:144:Times:144:Times:making its investment decision, the plan should have greater returns, more assets, and a 
9:396:27588:14:28:110:213:237:144:Times:65:Times:higher funded ratio.19

10:412:28523:14:14:108:540:680:144:Times:144:Times:time without putting aside funds to cover the promises, thereby creating a large unfunded 
10:413:28613:14:13:108:481:666:144:Times:144:Times:liability.  Therefore, the older the plan, the higher the expected funded ratio.

10:416:28791:14:14:108:519:624:144:Times:144:Times:Possible reasons for this pattern may be more sophisticated asset management, better 
10:417:28876:14:13:108:542:610:144:Times:144:Times:discipline because not funding could have a huge impact on taxpayers in the future, or the 
10:418:28967:13:14:108:535:597:144:Times:144:Times:effect of being more in the political spotlight than smaller plans.  In any event, a dummy 
10:419:29058:14:14:108:540:583:144:Times:144:Times:variable is included for plans in the top third in terms of assets, and its impact is expected 
10:420:29153:14:14:107:184:569:144:Times:144:Times:to be positive.

10:423:29257:13:14:107:495:527:144:Times:144:Times:level of benefits and funded ratios.20  Teachers have longer tenures than general 
10:424:29339:14:14:107:526:513:144:Times:144:Times:government employees and higher earnings (due to higher education levels), and these 
10:425:29423:14:41:108:336:499:144:Times:65:Times:factors translate into larger pension liabilities.21

10:427:29475:0:14:336:536:499:144:Times:144:Times:  Thus, the equation includes information 
10:428:29517:14:13:108:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:on whether or not teachers are included in a plan, and the coefficient is expected to have a 
10:429:29610:13:28:108:243:472:144:Times:144:Times:negative effect on funding.  
10:430:29639:28:14:72:537:444:144:Times:144:Times:Fiscal situation: The final factor that may influence funding is the fiscal health of the state.  The 
10:431:29741:14:14:72:489:430:144:Times:144:Times:notion here is that if a state is having fiscal problems, it may meet current non-pension 
10:432:29831:14:13:72:523:416:144:Times:144:Times:obligations by not making the annual contribution to the pension plan.22  Thus, plans in states 
10:433:29927:13:14:72:510:403:144:Times:144:Times:facing fiscal distress are less likely to be well funded.  The measure of fiscal distress in the 
10:434:30024:14:14:72:456:389:144:Times:65:Times:following analysis is the ratio of a state’s debt to its gross state product (GSP).23

11:474:32930:14:14:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:with high levels of debt to GSP are less well funded than those with lower levels.  As discussed 
11:475:33027:14:13:72:536:529:144:Times:144:Times:above, this fiscal ratio varies substantially (from 1.6 to 17.5 percent), and the results show that a 
11:476:33129:13:14:72:539:516:144:Times:144:Times:10-percentage-point change in the ratio reduces funding levels by about 6.5 percentage points.

11:479:33253:13:13:72:75:477:122:Times:122:Times: 
11:480:33253:13:14:72:500:464:144:Times:144:Times:As noted in the introduction, an assessment of the funding situation requires more than a 
11:481:33343:14:14:72:511:450:144:Times:144:Times:snapshot.  The real question is whether sponsors have a plan and stick to it.  One important 
11:482:33436:14:14:72:501:436:144:Times:144:Times:component of any plan is making the ARC.  Figure 8 shows that, in 2008, state and local 
11:483:33524:14:13:72:506:422:144:Times:144:Times:governments paid 100 percent of the ARC for only 60 percent of the plans in our sample.  
11:484:33613:13:14:72:523:409:144:Times:144:Times:Employers that contribute less than the full ARC could still be setting aside enough money to 
11:485:33707:14:14:72:520:395:144:Times:144:Times:cover currently accruing benefits.  They could even be reducing the plan’s unfunded liability 
11:486:33801:14:14:72:521:381:144:Times:144:Times:from previous years, albeit at a slower pace than the actuary would like.  Not making the full 
11:487:33896:14:14:72:533:367:144:Times:144:Times:ARC payment, nevertheless, indicates a failure to follow GASB’s suggested funding plan.  The 
11:488:33989:14:13:72:490:353:144:Times:144:Times:question is why such a large percentage of plan sponsors are not making the full ARC. 
11:489:34074:13:14:72:75:340:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:490:34074:14:14:72:541:326:144:Times:144:Times:Experts we spoke with suggested that a major reason that some sponsors do not pay the full ARC 
11:491:34169:14:14:72:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:is that they face legal limitations on how much they can contribute.  Indeed, a careful review of 
11:492:34267:14:14:72:507:298:144:Times:144:Times:the annual reports found that 50 percent of the 40 percent of sponsors that did not pay 100 
11:493:34359:14:13:72:367:284:144:Times:65:Times:percent of the ARC were legally constrained (see Figure 9).25

11:496:34423:27:14:72:535:257:144:Times:144:Times:For example, Oklahoma PERS made only 75 percent of its ARC in 2009.  The reason is that the 
11:497:34515:14:14:72:538:243:144:Times:144:Times:employer contribution rate is determined by statute and is smaller than the rate recommended by 
11:498:34611:14:14:72:536:229:144:Times:144:Times:the plan’s actuaries.  In the case of Oklahoma, the state legislature is aware of the inadequacy of 
11:499:34711:14:13:72:540:215:144:Times:144:Times:the statutory contribution rate and has been steadily increasing the legislated rate in an attempt to 
11:500:34813:13:42:72:338:202:144:Times:65:Times:catch up to the actuarially required contribution level.26

11:502:34871:0:14:338:521:202:144:Times:144:Times:  In fact, most states where funding is 
11:503:34911:14:14:72:529:188:144:Times:144:Times:legally constrained appear aware of this problem and are in the process of gradually increasing 
11:504:35007:14:28:72:193:174:144:Times:144:Times:their contribution rates.   
11:505:35035:28:13:72:508:146:144:Times:144:Times:The question is why the unconstrained plan sponsors failed to make the full contribution.

12:515:35471:13:14:72:542:654:144:Times:144:Times:full ARC payment: the discipline of the sponsor; the priorities of those involved in governance of

12:520:35740:14:13:72:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:that sponsors are less committed to funding their plans and therefore less likely to make the full

12:524:35965:14:14:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:may be important.  One view is that boards with a lot of workers and retirees could be more 
12:525:36057:14:13:72:512:529:144:Times:144:Times:interested in benefit expansion or greater cost-of-living adjustments than in funding benefit 
12:526:36151:13:14:71:513:516:144:Times:144:Times:promises, which could lead to lower contributions.  An alternative view is that workers and 
12:527:36243:14:14:71:524:502:144:Times:144:Times:retirees have more of a stake in the plan’s success than outside board members and, therefore, 
12:528:36338:14:14:71:507:488:144:Times:144:Times:their presence on a board would tend to have a positive impact on a plan’s funding status.

12:540:37094:14:14:108:502:335:144:Times:144:Times:would increase the likelihood that a sponsor would pay 100 percent of the ARC.

13:564:38867:13:14:72:533:654:144:Times:144:Times:employees/retirees decreases the probability of paying the ARC by 11-12 percentage points.  In

13:570:39165:14:14:72:529:569:144:Times:144:Times:The previous analysis suggests, albeit mildly, that the probability of making 100 percent of the 
13:571:39262:14:14:72:491:555:144:Times:144:Times:ARC payment is inversely related to the magnitude of the ARC.  If this cross-sectional 
13:572:39349:14:13:72:522:541:144:Times:144:Times:relationship holds over time, then the upward trend in the ARC as a percent of payroll for the 
13:573:39444:13:14:72:530:528:144:Times:144:Times:126 plans in our sample suggests that fewer and fewer plans will make the full ARC payment.  
13:574:39537:14:14:72:532:514:144:Times:144:Times:As shown in Figure 10, the ARC increased from 6.3 percent of payrolls in 2001 to 12.1 percent 
13:575:39631:14:14:72:538:500:144:Times:144:Times:in 2009.  The increase was driven at least in part from the collapse of the dot-com bubble, which 
13:576:39729:14:14:72:542:486:144:Times:144:Times:reduced asset values and increased the unfunded liabilities of the plans.  The ARC as a percent of 
13:577:39828:14:13:72:534:472:144:Times:144:Times:payroll increased steadily after 2002 as years of low equity values replaced earlier years of high 
13:578:39927:13:14:72:531:459:144:Times:144:Times:equity values in the smoothing process.  The ARC had more or less stabilized in 2008 and may 
13:579:40020:14:14:72:532:445:144:Times:144:Times:well have started to decline if the funds had not been hit by another market meltdown.  Instead, 
13:580:40117:14:14:72:542:431:144:Times:144:Times:the ARC as a percent of payroll was higher in 2009 than 2008, and is likely to grow over the next

13:590:40596:14:14:72:509:293:144:Times:144:Times:The entire discussion of funded status and ARC payments has been based on the liabilities 
13:591:40686:14:14:72:496:279:144:Times:144:Times:reported in the plans’ Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs) and Actuarial 
13:592:40770:14:13:72:529:265:144:Times:144:Times:Valuations.  To calculate these liabilities, GASB recommends discounting the stream of future 
13:593:40864:13:14:72:516:252:144:Times:144:Times:benefits by a rate based on the estimated long-term yield of plan assets – roughly 8 percent.  
13:594:40957:14:14:72:535:238:144:Times:144:Times:Most economists contend, however, that the discount rate should reflect the risk associated with 
13:595:41054:14:14:72:510:224:144:Times:144:Times:the liabilities and, given that benefits are guaranteed under most state laws, the appropriate 
13:596:41149:14:14:72:229:210:144:Times:144:Times:discount factor is a riskless rate.

13:602:41402:0:14:218:532:169:144:Times:144:Times:  The rate should reflect as little risk as the liabilities themselves, 
13:603:41474:14:14:72:539:155:144:Times:144:Times:be based on fully taxable securities (because pension fund returns are not subject to tax), and not 
13:604:41574:14:0:72:518:141:144:Times:144:Times:have a premium for liquidity (because most pension fund liabilities are long term and do not 
14:605:41670:0:14:72:517:709:144:Times:144:Times:require liquidity).30  Among the interest rates quoted in financial markets, those on Treasury 
14:606:41765:14:14:72:538:695:144:Times:144:Times:securities come the closest to reflecting the yield that investors require for getting a specific sum 
14:607:41867:14:14:72:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:of money in the future free of risk.  Currently, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, about 4 
14:608:41961:14:13:72:528:667:144:Times:144:Times:percent, is likely less than the riskless rate due to the valuable liquidity they offer investors.31   
14:609:42064:13:14:72:536:654:144:Times:144:Times:Therefore, we would suggest increasing the current rate by about 1 percentage point and using a 
14:610:42160:14:14:72:254:640:144:Times:65:Times:number of about 5 percent for 2009.32

14:613:42201:28:14:72:532:612:144:Times:144:Times:Some debate also surrounds the appropriate liability concept to use.  The use of the PBO seems 
14:614:42296:14:13:72:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate for pension plans in the public sector.  Benefits promised under a public plan are 
14:615:42391:13:14:72:534:585:144:Times:144:Times:accorded a higher degree of protection than those under a private sector plan, because under the 
14:616:42488:14:14:72:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:laws of most states, the sponsor cannot close down the plan for current participants.33  That is, 
14:617:42586:14:14:72:529:557:144:Times:144:Times:whereas ERISA protects benefits earned to date, employees hired under a public plan have the 
14:618:42679:14:14:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:right to earn benefits as long as their employment continues.34  Since public plan sponsors cannot 
14:619:42778:14:13:72:531:529:144:Times:144:Times:halt accruals under most state laws as can private sector sponsors, the PBO, which includes the 
14:620:42874:13:14:72:536:516:144:Times:144:Times:effect of future salary increases on the value of pension rights already earned by active workers, 
14:621:42973:14:13:71:284:502:144:Times:65:Times:seems like the correct measure of liability.35

14:627:43301:14:14:71:531:434:144:Times:144:Times:discount rate of 8 percent.  Assets in 2009 for these sample plans were $2.7 trillion, yielding an 
14:628:43400:14:13:71:537:420:144:Times:144:Times:unfunded liability of $0.7 trillion.  Using a riskless discount rate of 5 percent raises public sector 
14:629:43503:13:14:71:469:407:144:Times:65:Times:PBO liabilities to $5.4 trillion, which yields an unfunded liability of $2.7 trillion.36

14:633:43683:14:13:72:469:365:144:Times:144:Times:localities are not in any position to double or triple their contributions.  Therefore,

14:639:44204:16:12:71:528:258:99:Times:99:Times:municipal bond curve.  Their rationale is that states are equally likely to default on their pension obligations as on 
14:640:44323:12:11:71:78:246:99:Times:42:Times:their other debt.    31

14:643:44471:7:17:72:540:217:42:Times:99:Times:32 A 5-  percent rate is also consistent, for example, with a riskless real rate of 2.5 percent and an inflation rate of 2.5

14:647:44742:16:11:72:504:166:99:Times:99:Times:overstates the riskless nature of public liabilities, since some states and localities can alter the cost-of-living 
14:648:44858:11:12:71:536:155:99:Times:99:Times:adjustment (COLA) that they grant beneficiaries from year to year.  However, a survey of the 126 plans in the CRR 
14:649:44972:12:12:71:492:143:99:Times:99:Times:PPD shows that plans offering ad hoc COLAs account for only 20 percent of aggregate accrued liability. 
14:650:45075:12:11:71:509:131:99:Times:99:Times:Discounting ad hoc COLAs at 8 percent, rather than the risk-free rate, does not significantly alter the percent

15:660:45730:14:27:72:341:681:144:Times:144:Times:annual amortization payments for states and localities.   
15:661:45787:27:14:72:538:654:144:Times:144:Times:One change that probably could not wait pertains to the normal cost.  Reducing the discount rate 
15:662:45884:14:14:72:512:640:144:Times:144:Times:from about 8 percent to 5 percent would raise the present value of benefits and increase the 
15:663:45977:14:14:72:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:employer’s normal cost from about 7 to about 15 percent of payroll (assuming the employer paid

15:666:46095:0:14:175:533:612:144:Times:144:Times:  Since payrolls account for about 28 percent of state and local budgets, in 
15:667:46172:14:13:72:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:ordinary times, the increase would be significant but manageable.  Higher normal cost payments 
15:668:46267:13:28:72:407:585:144:Times:144:Times:will ensure that adequate reserves are put aside for today’s workers.

15:670:46366:14:14:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
15:671:46366:14:13:72:540:529:144:Times:144:Times:One of the attractive features of defined benefit plans is that they can pool investment risk across 
15:672:46467:13:14:72:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:individuals and spread risk over time.  Two financial crises within a ten-year period seriously 
15:673:46563:14:14:72:527:502:144:Times:144:Times:stress any defined benefit system, however, so an important question is for how long state and 
15:674:46658:14:14:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:local plans will be able to meet their commitments.  In other words, are the plans going to run 
15:675:46754:14:14:72:243:474:144:Times:144:Times:out of money?  And, if so, when?    
15:676:46790:14:13:72:75:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
15:677:46790:13:14:72:543:447:144:Times:144:Times:The simplest place to start is the ratio of plan assets to benefits, which shows for how many years 
15:678:46890:14:14:72:528:433:144:Times:144:Times:plans could – with no further investment returns, no additional contributions, and no growth in 
15:679:46986:14:14:72:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:benefits – continue to pay benefits.  Figure 13 reveals that, in 2001, assets were 23 times annual 
15:680:47085:14:14:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:benefit payments, suggesting that with money on hand state and local plans in the aggregate 
15:681:47177:14:13:72:529:391:144:Times:144:Times:could continue to pay benefits for 23 years.  In the wake of the bursting of the dot.com bubble, 
15:682:47274:13:14:72:535:378:144:Times:144:Times:this ratio dropped for the next four years to 19, and was headed back up until the financial crisis 
15:683:47374:14:14:72:530:364:144:Times:144:Times:of 2008.  The ratio now stands at 13.  Moreover, plans are distributed around that average ratio 
15:684:47471:14:14:72:518:350:144:Times:144:Times:(see Figure 14).  One plan – Kentucky ERS – has a ratio of 5, and 33 plans – including large 
15:685:47564:14:14:72:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:plans such as Illinois SERS, New Jersey PERS, and New York City ERS – have ratios between 6 
15:686:47656:14:13:72:116:322:144:Times:144:Times:and 10.   
15:687:47666:13:14:72:75:309:144:Times:144:Times: 
15:688:47666:14:14:72:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:While the simple ratio is useful for describing trends over time, in fact plan sponsors will 
15:689:47759:14:14:72:517:281:144:Times:144:Times:continue to make contributions, hopefully plans will earn returns on their assets, and benefit 
15:690:47854:14:14:72:540:267:144:Times:144:Times:payments will grow as the baby boom retires.  Given realistic assumptions then, how long before 
15:691:47950:14:13:72:195:253:144:Times:144:Times:plans run out of money?  
15:692:47975:13:14:72:75:240:144:Times:144:Times: 
15:693:47975:14:14:72:522:226:144:Times:144:Times:The answer to this question depends on how the exercise is structured.  Rauh (2009) adopts a 
15:694:48068:14:14:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:termination approach, essentially putting benefits earned to date into one plan with the existing 
15:695:48166:14:14:72:517:198:144:Times:144:Times:assets and creating a new plan where all accruing benefits are covered by future normal cost 
15:696:48259:14:14:72:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:contributions.  The question is then for how many years can the existing assets cover benefits 
15:697:48354:14:14:72:515:170:144:Times:144:Times:promised to date.   Since these plans are underfunded, without additional contributions they 
15:698:48447:14:7:72:218:156:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:                                                           
15:699:48505:7:16:72:534:149:42:Times:99:Times:37 Increasing the amortization period raises its own set of issues.  For example, payments made roughly 40 years or 
15:700:48621:16:12:71:535:133:99:Times:99:Times:more in the future add little to the present value of the payment stream.  Moreover, such a long amortization period 
15:701:48738:12:7:71:421:121:99:Times:122:Times:might not be viewed as a credible funding strategy by bond rating agencies and others. 
15:702:48824:7:17:72:518:114:48:Times:99:Times:38 As discussed above, actuaries use a number of actuarial cost methods to allocate the portion of future benefit 
15:703:48937:17:11:71:529:97:99:Times:99:Times:payments to each year for funding purposes, but this exercise simply calculates the present value of the additional 
15:704:49053:11:12:71:385:86:99:Times:122:Times:lifetime benefit accrued to the current workforce by one more year of service. 
15:705:49131:12:0:72:74:74:99:Times:99:Times: 
16:706:49134:0:14:72:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:ultimately run out of money.  The exhaustion date depends on the investment returns.  We have 
16:707:49228:14:14:72:526:695:144:Times:144:Times:replicated Rauh’s exercise (using a combination of Rauh’s and our actuarial assumptions) and 
16:708:49321:14:14:72:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:find that the exhaustion dates for current assets are 2022 with returns of 6 percent; 2025 with 
16:709:49417:14:13:72:424:667:144:Times:144:Times:returns of 8 percent; and 2029 with returns of 10 percent (see Table 4).    
16:710:49493:13:14:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:711:49493:14:14:72:508:640:144:Times:144:Times:The alternative approach is to treat the plans as ongoing entities.  This approach requires a 
16:712:49587:14:14:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:projection of actual benefit payments for current and future employees and the assumption that 
16:713:49682:14:14:72:521:612:144:Times:144:Times:plan sponsors can use future normal cost contributions to cover benefit payments.  Under the 
16:714:49775:14:13:72:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:ongoing scenario, the exhaustion dates are 2025 with returns of 6 percent; 2029 with returns of 8 
16:715:49873:13:14:72:523:585:144:Times:144:Times:percent, and 2035 with returns of 10 percent.  Of course, using normal costs to cover benefits 
16:716:49968:14:14:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:rather than accumulating payments in anticipation of future payments will worsen the funded 
16:717:50060:14:14:72:534:557:144:Times:144:Times:status of plans.  But if the issue is strictly one of plans running out of money, then using normal 
16:718:50160:14:14:72:318:543:144:Times:144:Times:costs to cover future benefits must be considered.   
16:719:50213:14:13:72:75:529:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:720:50213:13:14:72:536:516:144:Times:144:Times:Under either the termination approach or the ongoing approach, plans are distributed around the 
16:721:50309:14:14:72:519:502:144:Times:144:Times:average exhaustion dates.  Assuming the 8-percent return, we estimated exhaustion dates for 
16:722:50401:14:14:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:each of the 126 plans in our sample, and the results are shown in Figure 15.  As expected, the 
16:723:50496:14:14:72:533:474:144:Times:144:Times:ongoing scenario shows far fewer plans exhausting their assets in the next ten years, suggesting 
16:724:50593:14:13:72:445:460:144:Times:144:Times:that plans have more breathing room than the termination approach suggests. 
16:725:50669:13:15:72:75:447:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:726:50669:15:13:72:132:432:144:Times:144:Times:Conclusion 
16:727:50680:13:14:72:75:419:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:728:50680:14:14:72:543:405:144:Times:144:Times:Public pension funding has recently become a front-burner policy issue in the wake of the second 
16:729:50777:14:13:72:505:391:144:Times:144:Times:financial crisis in a decade.  Notably, before the 2008 crisis hit, state and local plans were 
16:730:50872:13:14:72:534:378:144:Times:144:Times:generally on a path toward full funding.  However, the collapse of the stock market has reduced 
16:731:50968:14:14:72:523:364:144:Times:144:Times:the aggregate funded ratio below 80 percent with some continued decline likely over the next 
16:732:51061:14:14:72:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:few years.  And the funded ratio looks much worse if liabilities are valued using the riskless rate 
16:733:51161:14:14:72:532:336:144:Times:144:Times:of return instead of the expected return on plan assets.  Not surprisingly, the individual plans in 
16:734:51261:14:13:72:497:322:144:Times:144:Times:the worst shape tend to be less disciplined in their funding approach, have less access to 
16:735:51352:13:14:72:519:309:144:Times:144:Times:investment professionals and economies of scale, provide higher benefit levels, and/or are in 
16:736:51446:14:14:72:263:295:144:Times:144:Times:states with relatively poor fiscal health. 
16:737:51488:14:14:71:74:281:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:738:51488:14:14:71:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:Yet the picture is not as bleak as it first appears.  First, most plans have made great strides in 
16:739:51587:14:13:72:536:253:144:Times:144:Times:improving their funding discipline and management in recent decades, meaning that they have a 
16:740:51681:13:14:72:532:240:144:Times:144:Times:solid foundation in place.  Second, even after the worst market crash in decades, state and local 
16:741:51779:14:14:72:540:226:144:Times:144:Times:plans do not face an immediate liquidity crisis; most plans will be able to cover benefit payments 
16:742:51878:14:14:72:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:for the next 15-20 years.  Third, states have already begun responding to their shortfalls by 
16:743:51972:14:14:72:541:198:144:Times:144:Times:increasing employee contributions and reducing benefits for new employees.  Finally, once plans 
16:744:52068:14:13:72:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:have regained their footing, any change in the measurement of liabilities could be handled so that 
16:745:52167:13:14:72:513:171:144:Times:144:Times:increased pension contributions are manageable.  Just as with private investors, though, the 
16:746:52260:14:14:72:522:157:144:Times:144:Times:future outlook of public pensions is closely tied to the recovery of the economy and the stock 
16:747:52355:14:14:72:114:143:144:Times:144:Times:market.

33:1348:67377:14:14:71:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:liability and to change the discount rate assumption.  A plan’s current pension obligation is the 
33:1349:67475:14:14:71:533:557:144:Times:144:Times:flow of expected future benefit payments to currently active employees and retirees, discounted

33:1351:67666:14:13:71:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:future benefits.  The PBO recognizes accruals due to future salary growth, but does not allow
