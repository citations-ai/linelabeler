3:29:606:18:29:149:466:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

3:31:656:35:31:72:144:591:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:ABSTRACT 
3:32:664:31:22:72:516:560:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The rulings of Mua‟malat in today‟s Islamic Economics, and Finance can be 
3:33:736:22:21:72:542:538:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:adapted through the process of Ijtihad. While the basic principles or doctrines of 
3:34:819:21:21:72:518:517:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the Mua‟malat are given in Shari‟ah, the interpretation of these principles to 
3:35:898:21:21:72:541:496:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:suit circumstances in different times and places constitutes the Fiqh Mua‟malat. 
3:36:979:21:21:72:516:475:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:New rulings can be reached by understanding the effective cause (Illah) and 
3:37:1054:21:21:72:534:454:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:rationale (hikmah) of the original ruling and the importance of Maslaha (benefit) 
3:38:1136:21:21:72:534:433:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:under the changed circumstances (Usul Fiqh); which is normally evaluated by 
3:39:1212:21:21:72:530:412:12:g_d0_f9:12:Helvetica:B:the Shari‟ah Board members of the concerned entity. Fatwa issuing via Ijtihad 
3:40:1290:21:22:72:508:391:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:is used to derive laws from the basic principles of Shari‟ah to address the 
3:41:1366:22:21:72:519:369:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:needs of people in different places and times. The important aspect of these 
3:42:1443:21:21:72:495:348:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:new rules is that they may at times change depending on the context of 
3:43:1514:21:21:72:530:327:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:application. Islamic Finance contemporary practices of Ijtihad through various 
3:44:1593:21:21:72:537:306:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:bodies like Islamic Fiqh Academy, have resolved the practice of taqlid (limitation). 
3:45:1678:21:21:72:499:285:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The doctrine of maqasid al-Shari‟ah establishes Maslahah as an essential 
3:46:1751:21:21:72:543:264:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:element of the ends of law, so that it becomes an important goal in framing new 
3:47:1831:21:22:72:507:243:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:rules (Shari‟ah parameters and guidelines) through Ijtihad. Thus, both the 
3:48:1906:22:21:72:537:221:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:principles set by Shari‟ah and use of Ijtihad to frame new rules has Maslahah or 
3:49:1987:21:21:72:370:200:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:benefit of people as the underlying basis and goal. 
3:50:2038:21:21:72:522:179:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:On the other hand; the standardization of Shari‟ah may become against the 
3:51:2112:21:21:72:539:158:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:fundamental premise of Ijtihad which has existed for centuries and especially in 
3:52:2193:21:21:72:528:137:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:today‟s finance. If rules become standards, and imposed by legal authorities, 
3:53:2271:21:21:72:509:116:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:then Ijtihad cannot be applied towards a critical and dynamic industry like 
3:54:2347:21:0:72:538:95:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic Finance today. This will eventually damage the very reason that we are 
4:55:2520:0:21:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:able to apply Shari‟ah in all times and places, that is, Ijtihad is the main reason 
4:56:2604:21:21:72:530:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:why Shari‟ah is dynamic and is able to be applied in different circumstances. 
4:57:2682:21:21:72:528:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:In addition; to standardize Shari‟ah rulings may mean the precedence of one 
4:58:2758:21:21:72:481:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic school of thought over the other, which cannot be universally 
4:59:2827:21:21:72:531:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:acceptable. There is no doubt that the synchronization of these two views has 
4:60:2905:21:22:72:538:574:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to be done through mutual understanding and collaboration between Shari‟ah 
4:61:2980:22:21:72:499:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:scholars and various Shari‟ah key board members, market leaders, and 
4:62:3049:21:21:72:518:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:regulators. To be very clear and accurate, the question of whether Shari‟ah 
4:63:3125:21:21:72:538:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:standards can be harmonized is a matter to be dealt with by Shari‟ah scholars 
4:64:3203:21:21:72:501:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and not market professionals or regulators. The simple reason for this is 
4:65:3277:21:21:72:524:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:because Shari‟ah scholars are specialized in their field and whether a Fatwa 
4:66:3354:21:21:72:517:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:can be standardized or not is a matter of religious reasoning and should be 
4:67:3430:21:34:72:394:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:taken from Shari‟ah own instructions and judgments.

4:76:3840:15:11:72:517:212:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:from the root word al-juhd, which means “exertion, effort, trouble or pain.” Al-juhd denotes

4:82:4381:11:12:72:506:138:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:political, social, commercial or economic. The whole corpus of Fiqh is based primarily on

5:90:4850:21:21:72:535:627:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic laws and rules are known as Shari‟ah and the study of them is Islamic 
5:91:4928:21:21:72:531:606:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:jurisprudence. Shari‟ah governs all aspects of Islamic matters including faith, 
5:92:5007:21:22:72:525:585:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:worship, economic, social, political, and cultural aspects of Islamic societies. 
5:93:5086:22:30:72:534:563:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The rules and laws are derived from three important sources, namely the Holy 
5:94:5162:30:28:72:521:533:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:Qur‟an, Sunna (the practice and tradition of the Prophet Muhammad) and 
5:95:5233:28:21:72:474:505:12:g_d0_f21:12:g_d0_f9:B:Ijtihad (the reasoning of qualified scholars). Further elaboration and 
5:96:5302:21:21:72:537:484:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:interpretation of the rules dictated by the Holy Qur‟an and Sunna are provided 
5:97:5380:21:21:72:510:463:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:by qualified scholars in Islamic jurisprudence via Ijtihad, an interpretative 
5:98:5457:21:21:72:523:442:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:process which is carried out within the framework of the Qur‟an and Sunna. 
5:99:5531:21:21:72:497:421:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Modern Islamic financial products and services are developed using two 
5:100:5602:21:21:72:535:400:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:different approaches. The first approach is by identifying existing conventional 
5:101:5682:21:21:72:519:379:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products and services that are generally acceptable to Islam, and modifying 
5:102:5757:21:22:72:508:358:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:them as well as removing any prohibited elements so that they are able to 
5:103:5830:22:21:72:535:336:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:comply with Shari‟ah principles. The second approach involves the application 
5:104:5906:21:21:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of various Shari‟ah principles to facilitate the origination and innovation of new 
5:105:5987:21:21:72:294:294:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products and services (Warde, 2000).

5:108:6057:23:21:72:493:227:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:The basis of Islamic commercial law is predicated on Fiqh al-Mua‟malat 
5:109:6126:21:21:72:519:206:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:(literally the Fiqh of human interrelations) which advocates the principles of

5:111:6286:21:21:72:539:164:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:transparency and accountability in all financial matters. In Shari‟ah, the moral 
5:112:6366:21:21:72:504:143:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:dictum that governs financial transactions and agreements is that all are 
5:113:6439:21:22:72:515:122:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:permissible, provided that they do not include a prohibited gain, activity or 
5:114:6516:22:21:72:495:100:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:commodity, such as Riba, Gharar, Maysir (gambling), specific foods and 
5:115:6586:21:0:72:534:79:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:beverages and indecent activities. By integrating religious doctrine and ethical

6:122:6936:21:21:72:516:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:While there may only be a handful of differences between conventional and 
6:123:7010:21:21:72:523:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic financial products, the distinctions are fundamental to the structure 
6:124:7087:21:21:72:534:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and the risk/return profile of these instruments. For example, Islamic finance 
6:125:7165:21:21:72:500:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:promotes risk sharing through partnerships and eschews interest-based 
6:126:7234:21:21:72:480:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:charges. This fundamental difference distances Islamic banking from 
6:127:7301:21:21:72:532:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:conventional finance (Wilson, 1997). For a long time, equity financing was the 
6:128:7379:21:22:72:529:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:dominant financial product being offered to depositors and investors (Siddiqi, 
6:129:7457:22:21:72:527:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:2000; Anwar, 2003). These are based on the concepts of profit-sharing in the 
6:130:7533:21:21:72:512:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:form of Mudarabah and profit-and-loss sharing Musharakah (Ayub, 2002). 
6:131:7602:21:21:72:474:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Flanking these were Murabahah contracts that have constituted the 
6:132:7666:21:21:72:500:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:cornerstone for working capital and short-term financing (AAOIFI, 2003; 
6:133:7737:21:21:72:364:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic Financial Services Board, 2005a, 2005b). 
6:134:7785:21:21:72:528:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:As the market evolved, Shari‟ah rules were introduced to chart the designs of 
6:135:7862:21:22:72:477:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:debt financing. Here the challenge was particularly onerous because 
6:136:7929:22:21:72:499:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:conventional debt is not necessarily asset-specific, whereas the Shari‟ah 
6:137:8001:21:21:72:535:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:requires the existence of an underlying asset or assets to back the transaction 
6:138:8080:21:21:72:459:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:(DeLorenzo, 1997; Khan, 2000; Bahrain Monetary Agency, 2002).

6:140:8140:23:23:72:386:170:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:C:Imam Shatibi’s Social Theory (d. 1388AD) 
6:141:8180:23:21:72:489:147:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The social theory contract was expounded by Imam Shatibi, who was a 
6:142:8248:21:21:72:504:126:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:contemporary of Imam Ibn Taimiyyah. The two developed and applied the 
6:143:8317:21:21:72:526:105:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:dynamic tenets of the Shari‟ah to practical social, economic and institutional 
6:144:8395:21:0:72:267:84:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:issues and problems of the time. 
7:145:8521:0:21:72:541:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Imam Shatibi was an original thinker on the development of the Shari‟ah in the 
7:146:8600:21:21:72:532:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:light of individual preference and social preference and their relationship with 
7:147:8680:21:21:72:507:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the institutional tenets of public purpose. Imam Shatibi thus brought the 
7:148:8753:21:21:72:517:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic discursive process (shura and rule making) to the centre of the very 
7:149:8829:21:22:72:531:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:important issue of development of the Shari‟ah through discourse, Ijtihad and 
7:150:8905:22:21:72:519:573:12:g_d0_f21:12:g_d0_f19:C:ijma (Shatibi, trans. Abdullah Darraz, 1390 Higri Calendar). Imam Shatibi‟s 
7:151:8979:21:21:72:494:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:preference theory, called Al-Maslaha Wa-Istihsan, is a forerunner of the 
7:152:9052:21:21:72:528:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:profound concept of social wellbeing in most recent times (SEN, 1990). In the 
7:153:9129:21:21:72:530:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:perspective of this concept, Imam Shatibi took up his principles on which the 
7:154:9206:21:21:72:320:489:12:g_d0_f24:12:g_d0_f9:B:Shari‟ah can be developed (Masud, 1994). 
7:155:9243:21:21:72:515:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:These principles are (1) universal intelligibility; (2) linking the possibility of 
7:156:9324:21:22:72:534:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:action to the degree of physical efforts rendered; (3) adaptation of the Shari‟ah 
7:157:9403:22:21:72:493:425:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to the natural and regional differentiation of customs and practices. By 
7:158:9475:21:21:72:526:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:combining these attributes in the development of the Shari‟ah, Imam Shatibi 
7:159:9550:21:21:72:503:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:was able to deliver a comprehensive theory of social wellbeing. The social 
7:160:9624:21:21:72:534:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:wellbeing criterion explained the aggregate view of preference in society within 
7:161:9704:21:21:72:227:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the tenets of the Shari‟ah. 
7:162:9731:21:21:72:533:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:By combining the above principles, Imam Shatibi examined both the core and 
7:163:9806:21:22:72:529:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f19:B:the instrumental aspects of the Shari‟ah. According to his „theory of meaning‟ 
7:164:9884:22:21:72:501:277:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of the core of the Shari‟ah (Usul al-Shari‟ah), Imam Shatibi dismisses the 
7:165:9957:21:21:72:516:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:existence of conflict, contradiction and difference in the divine law, arguing 
7:166:10035:21:21:72:490:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:that at the fundamental level there is unity. Variety and disagreement, 
7:167:10106:21:21:72:509:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f19:B:apparent at the second level are not the intention and objective of the law‟ 
7:168:10182:21:21:72:509:193:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:(Masud, 1994). This aspect of Shatibi‟s perspective on the Shari‟ah adds a 
7:169:10255:21:21:72:525:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:dynamic spirit to the moral law. Through such universality and the dynamic 
7:170:10330:21:21:72:509:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:nature of the moral law, Imam Shatibi was aiming at a universal theory of 
7:171:10403:21:22:72:171:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:social wellbeing. 
7:172:10420:22:21:72:479:108:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Using the integrative perspective of social preference made out of the 
7:173:10490:21:0:72:513:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:interactive preferences of members of society, Imam Shatibi thought of the 
8:174:10658:0:21:72:508:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:necessities of life as fundamental life-fulfilling goods. To incorporate basic 
8:175:10736:21:21:72:503:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:needs into dynamic evolution of life-sustaining regimes, he subsequently 
8:176:10808:21:21:72:365:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:introduced basic-needs regimes into his analysis. 
8:177:10857:21:21:72:487:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:These were the social needs for comfort and refinements of life. All the 
8:178:10930:21:22:72:495:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:components, namely basic needs, comfort and refinement, were for life- 
8:179:10999:22:21:72:518:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:fulfillment at the advancing levels of a basic-needs regime of socioeconomic 
8:180:11074:21:21:72:541:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:development. On the basis of the dynamic basic-needs regime of socioeconomic 
8:181:11150:21:21:72:510:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:development, Imam Shatibi constructed his social wellbeing criterion, and 
8:182:11223:21:21:72:501:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:thereby, his theory of preference and the public purpose, Al-Maslaha Wa-
8:183:11294:21:21:72:511:489:12:g_d0_f21:12:g_d0_f9:B:Istihsan. These ideas proved to be far in advance of their time in the social 
8:184:11371:21:21:72:263:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:meaning and preferences of life. 
8:185:11403:21:21:72:76:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B: 
8:186:11403:21:22:72:518:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Standardization tends to be an unsavory word in the Islamic finance space. 
8:187:11477:22:21:72:538:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Although it has been pointed out time and time again that financial innovation 
8:188:11554:21:21:72:501:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:is hampered by the lack of harmonized financial regulation, the different 
8:189:11625:21:21:72:535:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:jurisdictions are more than happy to march to the beat of their own particular 
8:190:11702:21:21:72:518:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:drummers, with a few contrarians pushing for the creation of a more global 
8:191:11775:21:21:72:166:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:infrastructure.  
8:192:11790:21:21:72:504:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:After all, they say, look at where Islamic finance is today, with over US$1 
8:193:11864:21:22:72:532:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:trillion in assets, having quadrupled over the last three years. This too, with a 
8:194:11944:22:21:72:542:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:weak systemic liquidity infrastructure, a lack of tradable Islamic Money market 
8:195:12021:21:21:72:535:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products, and a poor secondary market for Sukuk. Think of where it could be, 
8:196:12096:21:21:72:190:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:if we standardized.  
8:197:12114:21:21:72:494:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Those not in favor would cite the creativity in coming up with their own 
8:198:12186:21:21:72:538:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f19:B:contracts. Standardize? Why not charge interest? Why not invest in liquor? It‟s 
8:199:12264:21:21:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:a slippery slope that leads to conventional finance and securitizing five times 
8:200:12341:21:0:72:477:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:over to create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  
9:201:12502:0:21:72:527:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:While turning Islamic finance into a McDonald‟s of sorts (would you like fries 
9:202:12580:21:21:72:491:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:with that?) would be far from the ideal solution, there is room for some 
9:203:12651:21:21:72:520:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:standardization; in the language employed in Shari‟ah rulings, for instance. 
9:204:12725:21:21:72:512:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Standardizing the rulings would make it easier for companies to figure out 
9:205:12799:21:22:72:532:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:what these fatawa mean and for the rulings to transcend borders more easily. 
9:206:12874:22:21:72:488:573:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:Which is why the introduction of “Shari‟ah Parameters”, mentioned by 
9:207:12941:21:21:72:522:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Malaysian central bank chief Zeti Akhtar Aziz two months ago, may be more 
9:208:13013:21:21:72:501:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:momentous than the initial reaction, or underwhelming response, would 
9:209:13082:21:21:72:535:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:suggest. The trouble with Shari‟ah rulings, Bank Negara Malaysia observed, is 
9:210:13156:21:21:72:503:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:that nobody is quite sure what they mean or how to operationalize them. 
9:211:13226:21:21:72:544:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Even the bankers are not quite familiar with Islamic finance concepts and there 
9:212:13305:21:21:72:539:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:is a lack of publicly available documents on fatawa and Shari‟ah resolutions as 
9:213:13381:21:22:72:196:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:sources of reference. 
9:214:13402:22:21:72:526:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:It has also been pointed out that the considerable heterogeneity of scholastic 
9:215:13479:21:21:72:512:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:opinion about Shari‟ah compliance makes it difficult to create a consistent 
9:216:13552:21:21:72:422:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:regulatory framework and corporate governance principles. 
9:217:13607:21:21:72:538:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Bank Negara went on to say that the Shari‟ah Parameters are aimed at, among 
9:218:13682:21:21:72:488:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:other things, clarifying concepts, principles and conditions of Shari‟ah 
9:219:13752:21:21:72:527:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:contracts, providing the basis for decisions on matters relating to conditions, 
9:220:13830:21:22:72:503:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:mechanisms and implementation of Shari‟ah contracts, to say nothing of 
9:221:13900:22:21:72:516:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:facilitating Islamic finance professionals and practitioners in designing and 
9:222:13976:21:21:72:298:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:developing Islamic financial products. 
9:223:14013:21:21:72:536:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:It added that the Shari‟ah Parameters as standard guidance documents would 
9:224:14086:21:21:72:518:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:provide a more comprehensive understanding of the principles and basis of 
9:225:14157:21:21:72:513:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:adopting Shari‟ah contracts for Islamic finance products thus enabling the 
9:226:14230:21:21:72:332:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:harmonization of Islamic finance practices.  
9:227:14272:21:21:72:525:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:What this would mean is that a Shari‟ah board could write a decision in Abu 
9:228:14346:21:22:72:534:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Dhabi or Bahrain, for instance, and it would translate beautifully in Malaysia. 
9:229:14424:22:0:72:508:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:No ambiguity. No fuss. And funnily enough, a standardization in Shari‟ah 
10:230:14589:0:21:72:543:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:rulings would not stifle the development of new products; it will in fact, act as a 
10:231:14670:21:21:72:516:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:stimulus. While standardization should not be the be-all and end-all in the 
10:232:14744:21:21:72:517:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:development of Islamic finance, some boundaries just make for well-tended 
10:233:14816:21:21:72:130:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:gardens.

10:238:14890:14:21:72:76:517:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B: 
10:239:14890:21:21:72:531:496:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The Shari‟ah supervisory board is part of the internal governance structure of 
10:240:14967:21:21:72:536:475:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:an IFI and appointed by shareholders of the institution. Its main function is to 
10:241:15047:21:21:72:529:454:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:review and ensure that all transactions, contracts, products and applications

10:243:15198:22:21:72:495:411:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:specific fatwa, rulings and guidelines that have been issued. In order to 
10:244:15270:21:21:72:517:390:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:establish a good corporate governance framework, the Shari‟ah supervisory 
10:245:15342:21:21:72:517:369:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:board may have to extend its jurisdiction to cover governance issues of this

10:247:15425:21:21:72:519:327:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:According to the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), there is no “single 
10:248:15501:21:21:72:543:306:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:model” of corporate governance that will work in every country; each country or 
10:249:15580:21:21:72:400:285:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:even each organization needs to develop its own model. 
10:250:15634:21:22:72:510:264:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:From the standpoint of Islam, deeds are more significant than rhetoric, as 
10:251:15708:22:21:72:529:242:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:highlighted in one verse of the Quran: “Why do you say that which you do not 
10:252:15784:21:21:72:508:221:12:g_d0_f24:12:g_d0_f9:B:do?” Corporate governance should be practiced in the form of deeds. Only 
10:253:15855:21:21:72:520:200:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:when actions speak louder than words can a good corporate culture emerge

11:281:17502:21:21:72:537:214:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:Principles‟. The responsibility of the SSB is „to form an independent opinion on 
11:282:17582:21:21:72:198:193:12:g_d0_f24:12:g_d0_f9:B:Shari‟ah compliance. 
11:283:17601:21:21:72:534:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:It should be noted that the AAOIFI standard does not contain any information 
11:284:17678:21:21:72:542:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:about the duration of a SSB membership or on the possibilities and procedures 
11:285:17755:21:22:72:511:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of dismissal and reappointment. Despite the AAOIFI standard, the specific 
11:286:17828:22:21:72:480:108:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:rules and criteria for the selection and appointment of SSB members 
11:287:17894:21:0:72:525:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:(regarding, for example, the relevance and the relative weight of their Islamic

12:292:18380:21:22:72:543:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of their financial and non-financial rewards are not well documented in sources 
12:293:18459:22:21:72:534:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:open to the general public. Empirical research on the selection process of SSB 
12:294:18537:21:21:72:478:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:members and their professional careers (before, during and after the 
12:295:18605:21:21:72:511:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:membership) is still lacking. There are also no case studies on causes and 
12:296:18679:21:21:72:543:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:consequences of multiple memberships of individual scholars in different SSBs. 
12:297:18757:21:21:72:488:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Following the guidelines of AAOIFI, the board of directors suggests the 
12:298:18828:21:21:72:510:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:candidates for the SSB and determines their remuneration. Very often the 
12:299:18901:21:21:72:510:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:management has a strong influence on decisions of the board of directors. 
12:300:18974:21:22:72:499:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Therefore it is plausible to assume that top executives will have a strong 
12:301:19048:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:influence on the composition of the SSB and on the financial and non-financial 
12:302:19126:21:21:72:531:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:rewards for SSB members. As an independent body, the SSB is not subject to 
12:303:19200:21:21:72:523:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:instructions by the management, the board of directors or the shareholders. 
12:304:19275:21:21:72:504:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:SSB members are free to express their opinion and to sanction or decline 
12:305:19347:21:21:72:499:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:banking practices, techniques, contracts, dealings and transactions.[12] 
12:306:19419:21:21:72:517:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:This, however, does not mean that they are totally untouched by economic, 
12:307:19493:21:22:72:538:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:social, political and intellectual trends and developments. In addition, it has to 
12:308:19575:22:21:72:527:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:be borne in mind that SSB members had an initial motivation to accept their 
12:309:19650:21:21:72:534:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:appointment (whatever that motivation was, whether scholarly reputation, the 
12:310:19726:21:21:72:537:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:sake of Islam, financial reward or public visibility). If the membership of a SSB 
12:311:19807:21:21:72:535:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:does promote the achievement of individual goals, it is a plausible assumption 
12:312:19885:21:21:72:533:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:that the SSB members are interested in a continuing membership respondent 
12:313:19957:21:21:72:543:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:in a reappointment. This creates a factual dependence on the board of directors 
12:314:20036:21:21:72:539:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:which nominates SSB members and on the shareholders who appoint them. In 
12:315:20108:21:22:72:530:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:addition, if the interests of the management are well represented in the board 
12:316:20186:22:0:72:542:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of directors, the SSB members have to take these into consideration. As long as 
13:317:20360:0:21:72:531:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the management is supported by the board of directors and the shareholders, 
13:318:20435:21:21:72:493:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:this boils down to the hypothesis that SSB members will not ignore the 
13:319:20505:21:21:72:526:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:interests of the management when they apply their interpretation of Shari‟ah 
13:320:20580:21:21:72:521:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:principles to the activities, contracts and transactions of their Islamic bank. 
13:321:20659:21:22:72:515:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:This does not mean that they will always find ways to accept whatever new 
13:322:20732:22:21:72:538:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:financial product or transaction is submitted by the management. It must be a 
13:323:20810:21:21:72:497:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:prime concern of the SSB that the Islamic character of the institution is 
13:324:20883:21:21:72:508:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:recognized by the general public. But the SSB must also bear in mind the 
13:325:20955:21:21:72:516:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:survival and commercial success of the institution. Given this simple set of 
13:326:21030:21:21:72:523:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:behavioral assumptions for SSB members, a changing external environment 
13:327:21100:21:21:72:484:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:can explain the obvious change of attitudes of SSBs towards financial 
13:328:21169:21:21:72:514:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:innovations which imply new governance issues. The attitude of SSBs has  
13:329:21240:21:22:72:534:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:indeed changed over the years, from being rather restrictive to becoming quite 
13:330:21318:22:21:72:142:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:permissive. 
13:331:21329:21:23:72:76:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:

13:333:21377:23:21:72:461:337:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The early years of Islamic finance – the 1970s and 1980s – can be 
13:334:21441:21:21:72:534:316:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:characterized as high expectations and little experience. When Islamic finance 
13:335:21519:21:21:72:521:295:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:was introduced, not only to Muslims but also to the rest of the world, it was 
13:336:21596:21:21:72:516:274:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:often heralded as a unique financial system based on Qur‟an and Sunna. It 
13:337:21669:21:21:72:521:253:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:claimed superiority over the conventional Riba based system with respect to 
13:338:21743:21:21:72:523:232:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:allocation, distribution and stability. This claim was put forward not only by 
13:339:21820:21:21:72:475:211:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Muslim economists but also by Islamic banking groups such as Dar 
13:340:21884:21:22:72:518:190:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:al-Maal al-Islami. During these initial years, most shari‟a scholars were not 
13:341:21962:22:21:72:149:168:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:very familiar 
13:342:21975:21:21:72:530:147:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:with techniques, contracts and procedures of modern (conventional) financial 
13:343:22052:21:21:72:143:126:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:institutions 
13:344:22064:21:21:72:524:105:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and markets, and they were trained neither in economics and finance nor in 
13:345:22139:21:0:72:157:84:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:contemporary 
14:346:22246:0:21:72:508:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:business law. The economic world of traditional Islamic law was based on 
14:347:22319:21:21:72:110:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:trade, 
14:348:22325:21:21:72:493:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:handicrafts and agriculture, but not on industrial production, resource

14:356:22694:21:21:72:142:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to the early 
14:357:22706:21:21:72:475:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic period and recommended old legal constructs without much

14:359:22791:22:21:72:504:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:early approach was retrospective and in many ways restrictive. It created 
14:360:22865:21:21:72:125:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:tensions 
14:361:22873:21:21:72:522:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:between shari‟a scholars (and ideological proponents of Islamic finance) and

14:363:22964:21:21:72:536:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of Islamic banks. Islamic bank managers had to struggle with too conservative 
14:364:23041:21:21:72:526:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:SSBs which did not sanction financial instruments deemed necessary by the 
14:365:23115:21:22:72:155:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:management. 
14:366:23126:22:21:72:537:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Executives designed products and techniques which were better adapted to an 
14:367:23201:21:21:72:528:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:economy which had become much more diversified than that of Arabia in the

14:370:23362:21:21:72:132:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the needs

14:372:23450:21:21:72:119:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of more 
14:373:23457:21:22:72:516:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:appropriate financing instruments that disputable commodity transactions 
14:374:23530:22:0:72:136:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:were quite 
15:375:23635:0:21:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:common in this period. In the early years of Islamic finance it was a formidable 
15:376:23716:21:21:72:131:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:challenge 
15:377:23725:21:21:72:511:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to adapt the commercial law of past centuries to the needs of complex and

15:380:23827:22:21:72:509:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:After a decade Islamic banks had firmly established themselves in market 
15:381:23900:21:21:72:149:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:niches. They 
15:382:23912:21:21:72:493:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:heavily relied on trade-related modes of finance. Profit and loss sharing

15:384:23998:21:21:72:512:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:were extremely rare because of high transaction and monitoring costs, the 
15:385:24072:21:21:72:130:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:danger of 
15:386:24081:21:21:72:527:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:adverse selection (attracting projects with above-average probabilities of loss) 
15:387:24162:21:22:72:98:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and 
15:388:24165:22:21:72:508:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:insufficient demand from the entrepreneurial customers. The discrepancy 
15:389:24237:21:21:72:197:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:between the ideology 
15:390:24257:21:21:72:450:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and the practice of Islamic banking became increasingly visible. 
15:391:24321:21:21:72:513:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:With the passing of time it had become apparent that traditional contracts 
15:392:24396:21:21:72:131:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:could not 
15:393:24405:21:21:72:537:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:be applied directly but had to be modified considerably (as with musharaka for

15:398:24658:21:21:72:106:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:while 
15:399:24663:21:21:72:541:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:new instruments had to be designed for new and more complex financing tasks 
15:400:24738:21:21:72:142:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:which were 
15:401:24748:21:22:72:529:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:unknown to the traditional Islamic law (for example, project or infrastructure

16:403:24932:0:21:72:536:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:financing of working capital, consumer finance). Furthermore, instruments for

16:407:25103:21:22:72:248:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:markets were in urgent need. 
16:408:25131:22:21:72:538:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:During the 1980s, shari‟a scholars had accumulated more practical knowledge 
16:409:25207:21:21:72:124:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and had 
16:410:25214:21:21:72:504:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to recognize (together with Muslim economists) that the banking practice 
16:411:25287:21:21:72:165:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:deviated widely 
16:412:25302:21:21:72:516:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:from the ideological ideal. SSBs were confronted with requests – growing in 
16:413:25377:21:21:72:148:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:number and 
16:414:25387:21:21:72:521:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:urgency – of Islamic bank executives to sanction modifications of traditional

18:471:27989:21:21:72:475:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:towards financial engineering and product innovations which is less

18:473:28074:22:21:72:357:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:restrictive but more prospective and permissive. 
18:474:28122:21:21:72:534:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Innovations create new business opportunities, as long as the innovator has a 
18:475:28200:21:21:72:142:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:competitive 
18:476:28211:21:21:72:506:341:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f19:C:edge. When imitation sets in, temporary „monopoly profits‟ (or „innovation 
18:477:28286:21:21:72:136:320:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:rents‟) will 
18:478:28298:21:21:72:532:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:dwindle away. Therefore neither the management nor the SSB has an interest 
18:479:28373:21:22:72:146:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:in too much 
18:480:28384:22:21:72:530:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:disclosure of the Islamic qualities of financial innovations as this could speed 
18:481:28465:21:21:72:148:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:up imitation 
18:482:28477:21:21:72:537:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:by other banks. Islamic banking is by its character more complicated (because 
18:483:28555:21:21:72:109:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:it has 
18:484:28561:21:21:72:533:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to meet the requirements of the secular and the Islamic legal system) and less 
18:485:28640:21:21:72:145:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:transparent 
18:486:28651:21:21:72:534:130:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f19:C:than conventional banking. The need to keep „Islamic business secrets‟ makes 
18:487:28728:21:0:72:114:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:it even 
19:488:28830:0:21:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:more opaque than riba-based banking. Credibility of the Islamic qualities of the 
19:489:28910:21:21:72:128:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products 
19:490:28918:21:21:72:511:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and transactions is achieved, not by disclosure, but by the reputation and 
19:491:28993:21:21:72:112:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:public 
19:492:28999:21:22:72:305:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:recognition of the members of the SSB. 
19:493:29037:22:21:72:538:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The technical details of new transactions and innovative products can be quite 
19:494:29116:21:21:72:150:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:complicated. 
19:495:29128:21:21:72:500:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:A well-founded shari‟a analysis and assessment requires much financial 
19:496:29199:21:21:72:128:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:expertise 
19:497:29208:21:21:72:526:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:by the shari‟a experts. Distinguished and well-known shari‟a scholars with a 
19:498:29285:21:21:72:129:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:profound 
19:499:29293:21:22:72:527:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:understanding of financial techniques are in short supply. This explains why

19:501:29382:21:21:72:515:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:some outstanding shari‟a scholars are found in the SSBs of several Islamic 
19:502:29457:21:21:72:202:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:financial institutions, 
19:503:29480:21:21:72:536:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and in addition in advisory boards or committees of regulatory authorities and

19:507:29676:21:22:72:541:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:issues at the macro or policy level. For example, if prominent members of SSBs 
19:508:29755:22:21:72:134:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:determine 
19:509:29764:21:21:72:538:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the Islamic framework of Islamic banks, set the tone of public opinion and give 
19:510:29844:21:21:72:127:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:advice to 
19:511:29853:21:21:72:504:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:regulatory agencies, how will the independence of regulators be assured? 
19:512:29925:21:21:72:508:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:It seems that SSBs no longer impede the progress of financial technology. 
19:513:29999:21:21:72:134:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Instead, a 
19:514:30009:21:22:72:515:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:legalistic view has become dominant which deconstructs complex financial 
19:515:30082:22:0:72:143:108:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:techniques, 
20:516:30188:0:21:72:496:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products and contracts into a number of more basic components which 
20:517:30256:21:21:72:170:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:resemble (or are 
20:518:30272:21:21:72:505:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:identical with) legal figures of the traditional Islamic commercial law. The 
20:519:30349:21:21:72:160:616:12:g_d0_f24:12:g_d0_f9:B:shari‟a quality 
20:520:30364:21:22:72:514:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of these components is then assessed for each component separately. If no 
20:521:30438:22:21:72:157:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:objections are 
20:522:30452:21:21:72:506:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:raised against a component, the total product is sanctioned. This method 
20:523:30524:21:21:72:190:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:seemingly supports 
20:524:30542:21:21:72:514:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:financial engineering and product innovation in the Islamic segment of the

20:526:30626:21:21:72:517:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:market, but it has one very serious weakness: elements which are perfectly 
20:527:30701:21:21:72:133:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:legitimate 
20:528:30711:21:22:72:536:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:separately may interact in such a way that the result comes into contradiction 
20:529:30789:22:21:72:165:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of fundamental 
20:530:30803:21:21:72:531:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:principles of Islamic law. The dispute over the legitimacy of banking practices 
20:531:30883:21:21:72:87:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:in 
20:532:30885:21:21:72:521:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Pakistan is a well documented historical case, and questionable public debt 
20:533:30961:21:21:72:150:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:issues in the 
20:534:30974:21:21:72:321:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:form of sukuks are more recent examples. 
20:535:31014:21:22:72:539:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Besides the structural (external) factors for the change from a rather restrictive 
20:536:31097:22:21:72:126:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to a very 
20:537:31106:21:21:72:518:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:permissive attitude of SSBs, some personal (internal) factors may also be of 
20:538:31183:21:21:72:134:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:relevance. 
20:539:31193:21:21:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:First, if membership of an SSB is desirable for a shari‟a expert, he will avoid as 
20:540:31276:21:21:72:160:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:far as possible 
20:541:31291:21:21:72:537:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:whatever may endanger his reappointment. The attraction of SSB membership 
20:542:31365:21:22:72:97:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:can 
20:543:31368:22:21:72:520:108:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:have various reasons, ranging from idealistic objectives (participating in the 
20:544:31447:21:0:72:136:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:shaping of 
21:545:31552:0:21:72:520:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the Islamic finance system) to material considerations (substantial financial 
21:546:31630:21:21:72:157:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:compensation 
21:547:31642:21:21:72:185:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:for SSB members). 
21:548:31659:21:21:72:520:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Second, it seems that a sufficiently large number of clients of Islamic banks 
21:549:31737:21:22:72:138:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and public 
21:550:31747:22:21:72:507:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:opinion leaders do not require a very strict adherence to instruments and 
21:551:31821:21:21:72:154:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:techniques of 
21:552:31834:21:21:72:530:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the traditional Islamic business law. They are satisfied with the observance of 
21:553:31914:21:21:72:102:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:legal 
21:554:31919:21:21:72:538:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:minimum requirements. The ideological impetus of the early years has become 
21:555:31995:21:21:72:136:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:a minority 
21:556:32005:21:21:72:525:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:position. If this is a correct picture of the public and political environment in 
21:557:32087:21:22:72:108:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:many 
21:558:32091:22:21:72:536:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Muslim countries, then a too restrictive stance of SSB members could provoke 
21:559:32168:21:21:72:109:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:much 
21:560:32172:21:21:72:542:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:public criticism which would endanger the reputation of SSB members and put 
21:561:32248:21:21:72:121:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:them in 
21:562:32255:21:21:72:505:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:a defensive position. This is a serious problem particularly if other (more) 
21:563:32332:21:21:72:167:299:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f21:B:eminent shari‟a 
21:564:32347:21:22:72:495:278:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:scholars outside the given SSB approve similar techniques or products. 
21:565:32416:22:21:72:505:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:External and internal factors can explain why SSBs have adopted a more 
21:566:32487:21:21:72:138:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:permissive 
21:567:32497:21:21:72:497:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:attitude towards financial innovations. This seems to be the best way to 
21:568:32570:21:21:72:151:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:maintain the 
21:569:32582:21:21:72:500:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:importance of the SSB and its individual members. If the bulk of Islamic 
21:570:32655:21:21:72:194:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:financial techniques 
21:571:32675:21:21:72:516:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and products become standardized, an SSB is relevant only with respect to 
21:572:32749:21:22:72:151:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:nonstandard 
21:573:32760:22:0:72:500:87:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products and procedures, and these are usually financial innovations. A 
22:574:32926:0:21:72:541:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f19:B:restrictive stance against innovations which are proposed by the Islamic bank‟s 
22:575:33006:21:21:72:151:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:management 
22:576:33016:21:21:72:522:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:could cause a conflict with the management, the board of directors and also 
22:577:33092:21:21:72:101:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:with 
22:578:33096:21:22:72:538:595:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f19:C:shareholders who want a „progressive‟ or innovative bank or see a threat to the 
22:579:33176:22:21:72:143:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:profitability 
22:580:33189:21:21:72:520:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of the bank.Without innovative products, the bank may suffer a competitive 
22:581:33264:21:21:72:124:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:setback, 
22:582:33272:21:21:72:541:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and the relevant question becomes what the SSB is good for. It is welcome only 
22:583:33351:21:21:72:125:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:if it does 
22:584:33361:21:21:72:298:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:not block, but facilitates, innovations. 
22:585:33401:21:21:72:512:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:The SSB is a unique element in the governance structure of Islamic banks

22:594:33782:22:21:72:178:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:shareholders and 
22:595:33798:21:21:72:502:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Islamic depositors as well as among different „generations‟ of depositors). 
22:596:33873:21:21:72:510:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:b. The members of the SSBs, though formally independent, do have many 
22:597:33943:21:21:72:175:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:strong incentives 
22:598:33960:21:21:72:519:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to foster good relations with the management of the Islamic bank, at least if 
22:599:34038:21:21:72:101:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:they 
22:600:34042:21:21:72:523:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:are interested in continuing membership of the SSB. One implication is that 
22:601:34118:21:0:72:106:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:SSBs 
23:602:34217:0:21:72:477:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:nowadays have become definitely permissive with regard to financial 
23:603:34285:21:21:72:148:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:innovations. 
23:604:34297:21:21:72:498:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:c. The SSB issues statements and reports on the Islamic qualities of the 
23:605:34370:21:21:72:175:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:transactions and 
23:606:34386:21:22:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:products of its Islamic bank. But when it comes to the specifics of the financial 
23:607:34468:22:21:72:148:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:innovations, 
23:608:34480:21:21:72:441:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:the informational content of these publications is very limited. 
23:609:34544:21:21:72:515:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:d. It is not despite, but because of, the activities of SSBs that the economic 
23:610:34623:21:21:72:170:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:(and ideological) 
23:611:34640:21:21:72:380:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:distinctiveness of Islamic banking becomes blurred. 
23:612:34691:21:21:72:528:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Although the SSBs are unique elements in the governance structure, they do 
23:613:34766:21:21:72:159:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:not contribute 
23:614:34780:21:22:72:532:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:to the solution of old governance problems. Instead, they add new governance 
23:615:34856:22:21:72:300:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f6:B:issues at the macro and political level.

23:621:34961:31:22:72:76:228:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B: 
23:622:34961:22:21:72:534:206:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:When we have fundamental differences in fatawa issued around the world, we 
23:623:35034:21:21:72:499:185:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:are not really building a well-structured system. We invite much market 
23:624:35105:21:21:72:526:164:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:distortion manifesting itself in cross border arbitrage, market arbitrage, legal 
23:625:35185:21:21:72:542:143:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:arbitrage and, most dangerously, Shari‟ah arbitrage, which could at some point 
23:626:35263:21:21:72:533:122:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:lead to faith arbitrage. We have to always remember that this system is driven 
23:627:35341:21:21:72:478:101:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:by faith. It‟s not driven by transactions. It‟s driven by how we believe 
23:628:35412:21:0:72:332:80:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:transactions should be made and executed. 
24:629:35547:0:21:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:So when we have a system that is not consistent and has varied interpretations 
24:630:35625:21:21:72:541:658:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and pronouncements, we run the risk of imbalances and instability. This is not 
24:631:35703:21:21:72:484:637:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:a system that we would like to build. So we have to endeavor to reach 
24:632:35772:21:21:72:525:616:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:consensus and this is exactly what regulatory bodies like AAOIFI does. Their 
24:633:35846:21:22:72:536:595:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:Shari‟ahh board consists of all major sects in Islam. What we try to do is come 
24:634:35925:22:21:72:488:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:up with a structure that is acceptable to all those schools of thoughts. 
24:635:35996:21:21:72:76:552:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B: 
24:636:35996:21:21:72:536:531:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:It was also noted in AAOIFI standard that Shari‟ah Supervisory Boards should 
24:637:36070:21:21:72:519:510:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:not limit their role to the issuance of fatawa on the permissibility of (i.e. the 
24:638:36150:21:21:72:512:489:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:Sukuk structure, or any other Islamic financial product or instrument but 
24:639:36223:21:21:72:533:468:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:should continue to oversee the actual means of implementation at every stage 
24:640:36299:21:21:72:192:447:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:of the product‟s life. 
24:641:36321:21:22:72:494:426:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:We need to do screening of all the products available in the market and 
24:642:36392:22:21:72:514:404:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:evaluate the adherence of those products and the compatibility to Shari‟ah 
24:643:36465:21:21:72:527:383:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:principles and rules. We will identify those products that are in violation and 
24:644:36544:21:21:72:501:362:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:we will voice it out to the public. We will also try to talk to the concerned 
24:645:36621:21:21:72:515:341:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:parties about those products and perhaps provide some form of advice and 
24:646:36693:21:21:72:516:320:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:share with them ways to modify those products so that they are completely 
24:647:36766:21:21:72:191:299:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:Shari‟ah compliant. 
24:648:36784:21:22:72:532:278:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f9:B:It is not AAOIFI‟s role to be the watchdog of the industry. They are, after all, a 
24:649:36865:22:21:72:518:256:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:standard issuing body. However, I believe there is a huge gap in the market 
24:650:36940:21:21:72:533:235:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:regarding what is Shari‟ah compliant and what is not. And we thought we can 
24:651:37014:21:21:72:526:214:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:take advantage of our superior Shari‟ah board members to watch the market 
24:652:37087:21:21:72:499:193:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:and identify what is Shari‟ah compliant and what is not. We believe that 
24:653:37159:21:21:72:486:172:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f19:B:AAOIFI could take on that role temporarily; they‟re not going to be the 
24:654:37230:21:21:72:275:151:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:watchdog for the industry forever. 
24:655:37263:21:21:72:535:130:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:We live in a unique time of the Islamic Finance Industry. Although it is a huge 
24:656:37341:21:0:72:510:109:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:initiative that will no doubt be full of challenges, we think it is desperately 
25:657:37514:0:21:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:B:needed in the market, especially nowadays where we have a golden opportunity
