2:36:2045:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We document the loan provisions in 401(k) savings plans and how participants use 401(k) loans. Although
2:37:2148:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:only about 22% of savings plan participants who are allowed to borrow from their 401(k) have such
2:38:2245:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:a loan at any given point in time, almost half had used a 401(k) loan over a longer, seven-year horizon.
2:39:2349:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:The probability of having a loan follows a hump-shaped pattern with respect to age, job tenure, account
2:40:2452:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:balance, and salary, but conditional on having a loan, loan size as a fraction of 401(k) balances declines
2:41:2558:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:with respect to these variables. Participants are less likely to use loans in plans that charge a higher
2:42:2662:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:interest rate, and loans are smaller when plans allow fewer simultaneously outstanding loans, impose
2:43:2762:14:42:72:426:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:a shorter maximum possible loan duration, or charge a lower interest rate.

3:71:3330:0:20:108:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Borrowing from defined contribution savings plans, including 401(k) plans, has long 
3:72:3414:20:21:72:523:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:been permissible. Nevertheless, the impact of this borrowing on economic outcomes has only 
3:73:3505:21:21:72:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:recently begun to attract attention in the academic and policy worlds. The growth of 401(k) 
3:74:3597:21:20:71:541:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans, coupled with the introduction of the 401(k) debit card,1 motivated Senators Herb Kohl and 
3:75:3694:20:21:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Michael Enzi to propose legislation that would limit the number of outstanding 401(k) loans to 
3:76:3789:21:21:71:515:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:three per participant and ban 401(k) debit cards outright.2 The concern is that easy access to 
3:77:3884:21:20:72:518:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:one’s retirement nest egg will lead to excessive consumption in the present at the expense of 
3:78:3978:20:21:72:193:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:future financial security. 
3:79:4005:21:21:108:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:A: This paper is the first step in a research agenda on how the availability of 401(k) loans 
3:80:4095:21:21:72:505:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:affects retirement wealth accumulation. The aims of the current paper are descriptive. We 
3:81:4185:21:20:72:536:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:document both the widespread availability and utilization of 401(k) loans. About 90% of 401(k) 
3:82:4280:20:21:72:524:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants are in plans that offer a loan option. Within those plans, about one in five eligible 
3:83:4379:21:21:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants has a loan outstanding at a given point in time. Loan utilization rates follow hump-
3:84:4476:21:20:72:537:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:shaped patterns with respect to age, tenure, compensation, and plan balances, reaching peaks for 
3:85:4573:20:21:72:527:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants in their 40s, those with 10 to 20 years of tenure, those earning $40,000 to $60,000 
3:86:4670:21:21:72:533:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:per year, and those with $20,000 to $30,000 in plan balances. Conditional on having a loan, the 
3:87:4766:21:20:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan balance to 401(k) balance ratio is declining in age, tenure, compensation, and 401(k) plan 
3:88:4862:20:21:72:118:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:balance.  
3:89:4872:21:21:108:517:336:144:Times:144:Times:A: Despite the prevalence of 401(k) loans, they constitute only 2.5% of total plan assets 
3:90:4959:21:20:72:522:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:among plans with a loan option (Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, 2010).  For some 
3:91:5050:20:21:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals, however, 401(k) loans can be an important source of credit. Our empirical analysis 
3:92:5146:21:21:72:512:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:finds that 401(k) loan utilization is correlated with the types of loan rules adopted by firms. 
3:93:5242:21:21:72:541:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Loans are more likely to be used in plans that charge low interest rates, and conditional on taking 
3:94:5342:21:20:72:529:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:a loan, loan sizes are larger when multiple loans are allowed to be outstanding simultaneously, 
3:95:5438:20:21:72:449:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:the maximum loan duration allowed is long, and the loan interest rate is high.  
3:96:5518:21:21:108:504:191:144:Times:144:Times:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we describe the various 
3:97:5603:21:20:72:528:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:sources of data that we use. Section II discusses the availability of 401(k) loans. In Section III, 
3:98:5703:20:21:72:507:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:we explain how 401(k) loans work and describe the loan features that plan sponsors offer. 
3:99:5793:21:20:72:518:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section IV assesses how savings plan participants utilize 401(k) loans. Section V concludes.

4:105:6171:20:21:72:196:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:I. Data on 401(k) Loans 
4:106:6195:21:21:108:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:A: We exploit several different sources of data on 401(k) loans in this paper: published 
4:107:6281:21:20:72:537:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics, household survey data, firm-level 401(k) plan documents, and participant-level 401(k) 
4:108:6379:20:21:72:491:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:administrative data. We briefly describe each primary data source and its strengths and 
4:109:6467:21:21:72:134:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:weaknesses. 
4:110:6479:21:20:107:522:584:144:Times:144:Times:A: The first source of data is published statistics from a joint data collection effort by the 
4:111:6571:20:21:72:527:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) and the Investment Company Institute (ICI). The 
4:112:6662:21:21:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:EBRI/ICI database contains administrative data on 401(k) participants and their 401(k) plans 
4:113:6755:21:21:72:519:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:from thousands of firms that are affiliated with either EBRI or ICI. In 1996, the first year for 
4:114:6852:21:20:72:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:which such data were collected, the EBRI/ICI database included almost 28,000 401(k) plans with 
4:115:6947:20:21:72:501:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:over 6.5 million plan participants, representing 9% of all 401(k) plans, 18% of all 401(k) 
4:116:7038:21:21:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants, and 31% of all 401(k) assets (VanDerhei et al., 1999). Over time, the coverage of 
4:117:7134:21:20:72:510:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:the EBRI/ICI database has expanded: in 2009, it included almost 52,000 plans covering 21 
4:118:7223:20:21:72:537:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:million participants, representing 10% of all plans, 42% of all participants, and 44% of all assets 
4:119:7323:21:21:72:521:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Holden, VanDerhei, and Alonso, 2010). Although the EBRI/ICI database is not a random or 
4:120:7412:21:20:72:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:stratified random sample of either 401(k) plans or 401(k) participants, its distributions of total 
4:121:7511:20:21:72:519:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan assets and number of plan participants are very similar to those of the entire universe of 
4:122:7607:21:21:72:541:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) plans,3 making the data fairly representative at least on those dimensions. The 401(k) loan 
4:123:7706:21:20:72:539:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics published for the EBRI/ICI database include the fraction of firms offering 401(k) loans, 
4:124:7806:20:21:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the fraction of 401(k) participants utilizing such loans, and the average outstanding balance of 
4:125:7903:21:21:72:538:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) loans, all reported separately by plan size and by participant demographic characteristics. 
4:126:8002:21:21:72:526:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:The strengths of the EBRI/ICI statistics include their broad coverage of the 401(k) market and 
4:127:8097:21:20:72:541:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:their consistent reporting over the 1996 to 2009 time period. Their weakness is that the sample of 
4:128:8196:20:21:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms included in the calculations is neither constant nor completely representative over time, so 
4:129:8295:21:21:72:518:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:it is never clear whether differences over time and across plan and participant characteristics 
4:130:8391:21:20:72:399:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:represent true differences or just different selection into the sample. 
4:131:8463:20:21:108:532:150:144:Times:144:Times:A: The second source of data is published tabulations from the Employee Benefits Surveys 
4:132:8549:21:32:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:(EBS) conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These surveys, which have been conducted

4:134:8689:7:16:72:509:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 Holden, VanDerhei, and Alonso (2009) benchmark the representativeness of the EBRI/ICI database to data 
4:135:8794:16:0:72:356:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:published by Cerulli Associates on the entire universe of 401(k) plans. 
5:136:8867:0:20:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:periodically since the early 1980s, were designed to be nationally representative of certain types 
5:137:8966:20:21:72:527:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:of occupations in certain types of firms. The number of firms surveyed is substantially smaller 
5:138:9062:21:21:72:536:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the number of firms in the EBRI/ICI database (totaling in the low thousands rather than the 
5:139:9159:21:20:72:508:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:tens of thousands). The strength of these data is their representativeness for the population 
5:140:9253:20:21:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:covered by the survey design. The weaknesses of the EBS data are several: (1) the survey 
5:141:9342:21:21:72:539:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:population covered is somewhat limited,4 (2) there is a high non-response rate both for firms and 
5:142:9440:21:20:71:516:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the questions specific to retirement plans among the firms that did respond,5 (3) the only 
5:143:9535:20:21:72:519:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistic reported related to 401(k) loans is the fraction of 401(k) plan participants who are in 
5:144:9633:21:21:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:plans with a loan option,6 and (4) this statistic was only reported in the 1993, 1995, and 1997 
5:145:9729:21:21:72:146:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:surveys.   
5:146:9739:21:20:108:534:501:144:Times:144:Times:A: The third source of data is published statistics from the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of 
5:147:9830:20:21:72:533:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:America (PSCA). The PSCA data are derived from a survey of employers offering either profit-
5:148:9922:21:21:72:498:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:sharing or 401(k) plans and have two advantages over other data. First, they offer a long 
5:149:10012:21:20:72:531:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:historical perspective on loan availability, loan provisions, and loan utilization, with data going 
5:150:10112:20:21:72:531:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:back to 1990 for 401(k) loans.7 Second, the PSCA surveys collect extensive information on the 
5:151:10206:21:21:72:533:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan provisions at sampled firms. As with the EBRI/ICI data, the primary weakness of this data 
5:152:10301:21:20:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:source is that the sample of firms included is neither representative nor constant over time.  
5:153:10396:20:21:108:531:357:144:Times:144:Times:A: The fourth source of data we use is the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a triennial 
5:154:10483:21:21:72:535:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey of households. The primary advantages of these data are that the sampling is designed to 
5:155:10579:21:20:72:538:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:be nationally representative (when appropriately weighted), the data are publicly available at the 
5:156:10678:20:21:72:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual level (as opposed to available only at the aggregate level in the form of summary 
5:157:10771:21:21:71:535:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics, as is the case with the previous three data sources), the data include information about 
5:158:10872:21:18:71:538:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:portions of the household balance sheet other than the employer-sponsored savings plan, and the 
5:159:10968:18:7:216:219:235:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
5:160:11016:7:16:72:536:228:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 The survey population is limited to certain occupations in private, non-agricultural, non-household establishments 
5:161:11133:16:12:71:524:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:with 100 or more employees. The published numbers on savings plans with a loan option are limited to full-time 
5:162:11244:12:11:71:529:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (1998) reports that 33.4 million full-time workers fell within the scope of 
5:163:11360:11:7:71:504:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:the 1995 survey tabulations, which is much less than half of the full-time private sector labor force in 1995. 
5:164:11471:7:16:72:503:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (1998) reports that 60% of the establishments selected for the 1995 survey 
5:165:11579:16:12:72:529:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:responded. Among responding establishments, 30% of the retirement plan participants represented in the data had 
5:166:11691:12:7:72:321:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:their retirement plan provisions imputed due to missing data.  
5:167:11754:7:16:72:526:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 A handful of loan-related provisions for other categories of defined contribution savings plans (e.g. savings and 
5:168:11870:16:11:72:508:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:thrift plans, deferred profit sharing plans) are reported. These include whether loans are restricted to cases of 
5:169:11984:11:12:72:534:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:hardship, whether participants’ full account balances are available to be borrowed, and the length of the repayment 
5:170:12100:12:7:72:533:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:period. The vast majority of savings and thrift plans are also 401(k) plans, but the converse is less likely to be true. 
5:171:12221:7:16:72:534:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 The PSCA first began surveying firms offering profit-sharing plans in 1957. Over time, as regulatory changes led 
5:172:12336:16:11:72:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:many profit-sharing plans to incorporate a 401(k) component, the survey framework was adjusted to incorporate 
5:173:12446:11:0:72:252:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:401(k) plans as well as profit-sharing plans.  
6:174:12494:0:20:72:527:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:data include questions on savings plan loans going back to 1989. The primary disadvantage of 
6:175:12587:20:21:72:525:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the SCF is that the questions on savings plan loans are asked only of savings plan participants 
6:176:12683:21:21:72:518:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and not of those eligible to participate but not currently participating) and are fairly limited. 
6:177:12782:21:20:72:521:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:Nonetheless, it is the only source of information on the reasons why individuals borrow from 
6:178:12875:20:21:72:167:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:their savings plans. 
6:179:12896:21:21:108:508:605:144:Times:144:Times:A: Our final two sources of data come from Aon Hewitt, a firm that administers many 
6:180:12977:21:20:72:540:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) plans. The first consists of plan descriptions from years ranging from 2002 to 2004 for 87 
6:181:13075:20:21:72:528:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) plans that offer loans at 79 large companies. The primary advantage of these data is the 
6:182:13171:21:21:72:480:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:level of detail they give about the loan provisions in these 401(k) plans. The primary 
6:183:13258:21:21:72:501:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:disadvantages are the limited number of firms in the sample and the fact that they are not 
6:184:13349:21:20:72:523:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:representative of the universe of firms offering 401(k) loans, although they may be somewhat 
6:185:13442:20:21:72:323:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:representative of large firms that offer 401(k) loans. 
6:186:13497:21:21:108:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:A: Our second source of data from Aon Hewitt is a series of year-end cross-sections from 
6:187:13583:21:20:71:509:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002 to 2008. The cross-sections include individual-level data on all employees eligible to 
6:188:13675:20:21:71:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:participate in their companies’ 401(k) plans. They contain demographic information such as birth 
6:189:13772:21:21:71:529:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:date, hire date, gender, and compensation.8 They also contain information on each individual’s 
6:190:13867:21:20:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k), including participation status in the plan at year-end, date of first participation, monthly 
6:191:13968:20:21:71:535:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:contribution rates, asset allocation, plan balances, and 401(k) loans outstanding at the end of the 
6:192:14068:21:21:71:532:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:year. For participants with a loan, we know the date on which each loan was taken out, the loan 
6:193:14164:21:20:71:539:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms (interest rate, amount due per payment, scheduled payment frequency, and total number of 
6:194:14259:20:21:71:494:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments due), and whether the loan was delinquent or had been converted to a taxable 
6:195:14345:21:21:71:516:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:withdrawal due to non-payment. The primary advantage of this data source is the amount of 
6:196:14435:21:21:71:501:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on loans and other aspects of individuals’ 401(k) accounts. This allows us to 
6:197:14525:21:20:71:410:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine in greater detail how 401(k) participants utilize 401(k) loans.

6:199:14597:21:21:71:232:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:II. Availability of 401(k) Loans 
6:200:14630:21:20:108:509:170:144:Times:144:Times:A: The regulation of 401(k) loans is shared by the Department of the Treasury and the 
6:201:14713:20:21:71:542:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Department of Labor, the two agencies that jointly regulate tax-favored savings plans.9 Under the 
6:202:14811:21:32:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Internal Revenue Code, qualified retirement savings plans may (but are not required to) provide 
6:203:14907:32:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
6:204:14955:7:12:72:326:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 The data on compensation are not reported for all companies. 
6:205:15018:12:0:72:383:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 See U.S. GAO (2009) for a summary of the laws that regulate 401(k) loans. 
7:206:15095:0:20:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan participants with the option of obtaining one or more loans against their plan balances.10 If 
7:207:15194:20:21:71:526:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:plans do make loans available, they must be made available to all participants on a reasonably 
7:208:15289:21:21:71:157:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:equivalent basis.  
7:209:15308:21:20:108:513:646:144:Times:144:Times:A: There are two sources of data on the fraction of 401(k) plans with a loan option: the 
7:210:15394:20:21:71:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:EBRI/ICI database and the PSCA surveys. Using the EBRI/ICI database (which covers many 
7:211:15481:21:21:71:533:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:more firms than the PSCA surveys), Holden, VanDerhei, and Alonso (2010) calculate that 61% 
7:212:15572:21:20:71:521:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:of plans in 2009 include a loan provision. Loan availability is much higher in the PSCA data, 
7:213:15666:20:21:71:528:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:with 88% of plan respondents offering a loan option in 2009 (Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of 
7:214:15760:21:21:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:America, 2010). Both data sources indicate some increase in the availability of loans over time 
7:215:15856:21:21:71:528:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Figure 1). Large plans are more likely to offer a loan provision than small plans (Figure 2). In 
7:216:15954:21:20:71:498:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 2009 EBRI/ICI data, 94% of plans with more than 10,000 participants offered loans, 
7:217:16041:20:21:71:532:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to only 35% of plans with 10 or fewer participants (Holden, VanDerhei, and Alonso, 
7:218:16133:21:21:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010). The patterns in the PSCA surveys are similar, although the gradient with respect to plan 
7:219:16229:21:20:71:175:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:size is much smaller. 
7:220:16251:20:21:107:518:419:144:Times:144:Times:A: Because most individuals work in large companies and large plans are more likely to 
7:221:16335:21:21:71:527:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:offer loans, the fraction of 401(k) participants whose plan offers loans is much higher than the 
7:222:16432:21:20:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of 401(k) plans that offer loans. In the most current EBRI/ICI data year (2009), 89% of 
7:223:16529:20:21:71:541:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) participants belong to a plan offering loans, even though only 61% of the plans in the data 
7:224:16628:21:21:71:533:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:offer loans (Holden, VanDerhei, and Alonso, 2010). The fraction of plans with a loan provision 
7:225:16723:21:20:71:533:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:has increased only slightly in the past decade, but the EBRI/ICI data suggest that the fraction of 
7:226:16822:20:21:71:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants whose savings plan offers a loan option has increased substantially during that time, 
7:227:16921:21:21:71:517:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 70% in 1996 to 89% in 2009 (Figure 3). The EBS also collected data on the fraction of 
7:228:17012:21:21:71:534:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) participants with a loan option during the 1990s. Although the prevalence of loans in the 
7:229:17109:21:20:71:521:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:EBS is much lower than in the EBRI/ICI data, the EBS also shows an increase in loan access 
7:230:17200:20:21:71:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:from 43% of participants in 1993 to 51% in 1997 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1995, 1998 and 
7:231:17292:21:21:71:108:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999).  
7:232:17300:21:20:108:518:170:144:Times:144:Times:A: Note that in 1997, the one year when the two data sources overlap, there is a sizeable 
7:233:17387:20:21:71:540:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrepancy in the fraction of participants reported to belong to a plan with a loan option: 51% in 
7:234:17487:21:20:71:482:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the EBS data versus 79% in the EBRI/ICI data. It is not obvious how to interpret this 
7:235:17573:20:8:216:219:109:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
7:236:17621:8:16:72:541:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 Qualified plans are those that satisfy the requirements of I.R.C. 401(a), annuity plans that satisfy 403(a) or 403(b), 
7:237:17743:16:11:71:513:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:and governmental plans (Internal Revenue Service, 2011). Loans are not permitted from IRAs, SEPs, or other 
7:238:17850:11:0:71:127:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:similar plans. 
8:239:17866:0:20:72:501:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:discrepancy. Neither sample is completely representative of all 401(k) plans. The EBS is 
8:240:17955:20:21:72:527:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:designed to be representative of certain occupations in private establishments with at least 100 
8:241:18052:21:21:72:484:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:employees, so small employers (and thus small savings plans) and workers in several 
8:242:18136:21:20:72:494:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:occupations are necessarily excluded. The EBRI/ICI database, while not designed to be 
8:243:18222:20:21:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:representative, does include small plans and appears to be fairly representative of the 401(k) plan 
8:244:18322:21:21:72:531:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:universe on several dimensions; it also covers a sizeable share of the total market. The fact that 
8:245:18421:21:20:72:532:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:the EBRI/ICI number is higher than the EBS number is puzzling given the exclusion of smaller 
8:246:18514:20:21:72:530:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms from the EBS data, since loans are less likely to be offered in smaller plans than in larger 
8:247:18613:21:21:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:ones. If the EBS survey had included smaller firms, the gap between the EBS and EBRI/ICI 
8:248:18702:21:21:72:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of loan availability would have been even larger. Both data sources indicate that 401(k) 
8:249:18801:21:20:72:541:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan availability has grown over time, but what is less clear is exactly how many participants had

8:252:18957:21:20:72:214:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:III. 401(k) Loan Provisions 
8:253:18985:20:21:108:528:419:144:Times:144:Times:A: The terms of a 401(k) loan are set by individual savings plans within certain regulatory 
8:254:19074:21:21:72:518:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:bounds. When a loan is made to a 401(k) participant, the plan liquidates some of its assets to 
8:255:19169:21:20:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:make the loan disbursement. The participant is then responsible for the timely repayment of the 
8:256:19265:20:21:72:530:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan. Loan payments, which include both principal and interest, are made with after-tax dollars 
8:257:19361:21:21:72:520:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:and are credited to the participant’s account, transferring principal back into the participant’s 
8:258:19459:21:20:72:135:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments. 
8:259:19472:20:21:108:541:295:144:Times:144:Times:A: There are no regulatory restrictions on how the proceeds from a 401(k) loan may be used; 
8:260:19561:21:21:72:516:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:nor are borrowers required to demonstrate financial need.11 Plan sponsors have discretion to 
8:261:19654:21:21:72:505:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:impose such restrictions if desired, but most do not. The PSCA (1999) reports that among 
8:262:19743:21:20:72:503:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:savings plans with a loan option, 82% place no restrictions on how loan proceeds may be 
8:263:19831:20:21:72:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilized.12 Of the 18% of plans with restrictions, most allow loans for home purchases, education, 
8:264:19930:21:25:72:183:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:and medical expenses. 
8:265:19952:25:7:216:219:166:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
8:266:20000:7:16:72:541:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 In contrast, hardship withdrawals—which plans are allowed but not required to offer—are limited by regulation to 
8:267:20116:16:12:72:540:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:be used for “immediate and heavy” expenditures for which no other resources are available. Allowable expenditures 
8:268:20230:12:11:72:541:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:include medical expenses, educational expenses, burial or funeral expenses, expenditures related to the purchase of a 
8:269:20348:11:7:72:339:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:home, and payments necessary to forestall eviction or foreclosure. 
8:270:20415:7:16:72:539:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 Restrictions are more common in profit sharing plans (27%) than in 401(k) plans (16%), and are more common in 
8:271:20528:16:12:71:534:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:smaller plans than in larger ones (Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America). Similarly, data from the EBS suggest 
8:272:20643:12:11:71:542:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:that only 7% of savings and thrift plans place restrictions on how loan proceeds may be used (most savings and thrift 
8:273:20761:11:0:71:168:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:plans are 401(k) plans). 
9:274:20787:0:20:108:494:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: There are, however, regulations on the maximum size of 401(k) loans. The total 
9:275:20866:20:21:72:499:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding principal of all unpaid loans can be no larger than the minimum of 50% of a 
9:276:20954:21:21:72:533:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:participant’s vested account balance and $50,000 (employers can place additional size limits).13 
9:277:21050:21:20:71:534:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:The only information we have on the actual maximum limits that plan sponsors place on 401(k) 
9:278:21143:20:21:71:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan size comes from our sample of Aon Hewitt plan descriptions. In this sample, all plans 
9:279:21234:21:21:71:484:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:adhere to the statutory limits, although some do so with some minor modifications.14  
9:280:21320:21:20:108:520:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:Plans can also place restrictions on the minimum loan size. In the 2009 PSCA annual 
9:281:21404:20:21:72:537:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:survey, only 3% of plans report having no minimum loan limit. Twelve percent of plans report a 
9:282:21499:21:21:72:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive limit of $500 or less; 84% report a limit between $501 and $1,000; and the remaining 
9:283:21593:21:21:72:501:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:2% report some other limit. In our sample of Aon Hewitt plan descriptions (Table 1), the 
9:284:21682:21:20:72:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum loan amounts are roughly in line with those in the PSCA survey: 28% have a minimum 
9:285:21773:20:21:72:541:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan amount of $500 or less15; 69% have a minimum loan amount between $501 and $1,000; and 
9:286:21864:21:21:72:339:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:3% have a minimum loan amount greater than $1,000.  
9:287:21916:21:20:107:521:439:144:Times:144:Times:A: Plans are allowed to charge both an application fee and an annual service fee for each 
9:288:22003:20:21:72:534:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) loan. Survey data from the PSCA suggest that such fees are becoming more common. In 
9:289:22094:21:21:72:522:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:the 1990 PSCA survey, only 26% of plans reported having loan fees; in the 2009 survey, this 
9:290:22186:21:20:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:number had risen to 90%. The most common fee is a loan origination or application fee, which 
9:291:22279:20:21:72:528:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:85% of 2009 PSCA plans report having; among these plans, the median application fee is $75. 
9:292:22371:21:21:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Twenty-eight percent of plans report charging an annual maintenance fee, with a median amount 
9:293:22465:21:20:72:538:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:of $25. Ten percent of plans report charging some other sort of fee. In our sample of Aon Hewitt 
9:294:22562:20:21:72:540:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan descriptions, 43% either report having no fees or make no mention of any fees (Table 1). Of 
9:295:22659:21:21:72:530:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:the remaining plans, none report having any fees other than application fees, which range from 
9:296:22754:21:52:72:376:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:$25 to $100 for general purpose loans, with a median of $50.16 
9:297:22816:52:8:216:219:201:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
9:298:22864:8:16:72:537:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 The regulatory language also suggests that employers have discretion to allow loans of up to $10,000, even if this 
9:299:22982:16:11:71:527:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:exceeds the limit of 50% of a participant’s vested balance. Conversations with plan administrators suggest that in 
9:300:23097:11:12:71:515:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:practice this is rarely allowed because of concerns that doing so could violate regulatory provisions in ERISA. 
9:301:23209:12:11:71:527:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:Participants affected by the 2005 hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Wilma face a higher limit: the lesser of $100,000 or 
9:302:23325:11:7:71:247:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:100% of the participant’s account balance.  
9:303:23369:7:16:72:509:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 Other restrictions included additional limits on loan amounts for participants with assets allocated to a self-
9:304:23483:16:7:71:261:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:directed brokerage window or employer stock. 
9:305:23528:7:12:72:402:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 Only one firm in the Aon Hewitt sample has a loan minimum of less than $500. 
9:306:23608:12:16:72:539:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 Two of the plans in the Aon Hewitt sample have a higher fee for primary residence loans than for general purpose 
9:307:23724:16:11:71:532:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:loans. One company has a higher fee for loans requested through a benefits representative than for loans requested 
9:308:23839:11:0:71:319:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:on the benefits website, and we use the lower fee for Table 1. 
10:309:23903:0:20:107:467:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Employers may allow participants to have more than one loan outstanding 
10:310:23975:20:21:72:490:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:simultaneously, although the loans would in total be subject to the maximum loan size 
10:311:24061:21:21:72:538:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions noted previously. In the latest PSCA survey, about half of plans allow participants to 
10:312:24161:21:20:71:532:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:have more than one loan outstanding. Large plans are much more likely to allow multiple loans 
10:313:24255:20:21:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:than small plans: for example, 38% of plans with fewer than 50 participants allow multiple loans, 
10:314:24353:21:21:71:506:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:while 57% of plans with over 5,000 participants do. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the 
10:315:24444:21:20:71:516:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximum number of loans allowed in the 2009 PSCA survey.17 Most (52%) allow only one 
10:316:24529:20:21:72:513:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan, 37% allow two loans, and 8% allow three loans. Only 3% of plans allow four or more 
10:317:24618:21:21:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans. In our sample of Aon Hewitt plan descriptions, 33% restrict participants to only one loan, 
10:318:24716:21:21:72:513:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:56% allow participants to take out two loans, and 10% allow three or more loans (Table 1). 
10:319:24807:21:20:108:536:501:144:Times:144:Times:A: Employers have some discretion in establishing loan repayment procedures. Regulations 
10:320:24893:20:21:72:530:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:require that loan payments be made at least quarterly and pay down both principal and interest. 
10:321:24989:21:21:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:In practice, many companies use automatic payroll deduction for loan repayments, so loan 
10:322:25078:21:20:72:527:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments are made on a monthly or biweekly basis. The amortization period for a 401(k) loan 
10:323:25170:20:21:72:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:can typically be chosen by participants within a set of constraints established by the plan. These 
10:324:25269:21:21:72:535:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraints are dictated in part by regulatory requirements. One such requirement is that general 
10:325:25367:21:20:72:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:purpose loans must be repaid within five years, although employers can choose a shorter 
10:326:25455:20:21:72:514:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximum repayment horizon. Employers can establish a longer repayment period for loans 
10:327:25542:21:21:72:501:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:taken for investment in a primary residence. Early repayment of loans (potentially with a 
10:328:25632:21:20:72:262:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:prepayment penalty) is also allowed.18  
10:329:25672:20:21:108:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:A: Our source of information on the distribution of both minimum and maximum loan 
10:330:25751:21:21:72:520:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:amortization periods is the sample of Aon Hewitt plan descriptions (Table 1). In this sample, 
10:331:25845:21:21:72:538:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:about two-thirds of plans have a minimum duration of more than six months for general purpose 
10:332:25939:21:20:72:533:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans; the rest either do not specify a minimum repayment period or specify a shorter minimum 
10:333:26033:20:21:72:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:repayment period (usually one or six months). Almost three-quarters of plans have a maximum 
10:334:26125:21:21:72:537:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:repayment period of five years for general purpose loans, the statutory maximum; the remaining 
10:335:26220:21:20:72:507:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:quarter either do not specify a maximum repayment period or specify a shorter repayment 
10:336:26308:20:18:72:285:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:period, usually between four and five years. 
10:337:26353:18:8:216:219:132:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
10:338:26401:8:16:72:503:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 This figure includes both profit-sharing and 401(k) plans, as the PSCA does not report the distribution of 
10:339:26511:16:11:71:542:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:permissible loans separately by defined contribution plan type. The fraction of plans that allow more than one loan is 
10:340:26630:11:7:71:407:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:reported separately by plan type, and this fraction is similar for both types of plans. 
10:341:26718:7:16:72:537:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 Prepayment penalties appear to be rare. None of the plans in our Aon Hewitt sample of plan descriptions imposes 
10:342:26833:16:0:71:162:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:a prepayment penalty. 
11:343:26857:0:20:107:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Of the plans in the Aon Hewitt plan description sample, all offer general purpose loans, 
11:344:26946:20:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 74% allow both primary residence and general purpose loans (Table 1). The main distinction 
11:345:27041:21:21:71:496:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:between general purpose and primary residence loans is that the latter can have a longer 
11:346:27130:21:20:71:524:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:repayment period and the plan must verify that the loan is being used for a primary residence. 
11:347:27225:20:21:71:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Primary residence loans require both additional documentation from applicants and additional 
11:348:27318:21:21:71:525:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing by plan sponsors.19 As with general purpose loans, the modal minimum repayment 
11:349:27408:21:20:72:537:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:period for primary residence loans is twelve months, but plans often stipulate a longer minimum 
11:350:27504:20:21:72:520:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan duration. Forty-two percent of the Aon Hewitt plans have a minimum repayment period 
11:351:27593:21:21:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceeding twelve months for a primary residence loan, and a minimum repayment period of five 
11:352:27686:21:21:72:538:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:to six years is the most common within this subset of plans. The maximum repayment period for 
11:353:27780:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary residence loans varies widely across plans, ranging from 117 months to 360 months. The 
11:354:27875:20:21:72:400:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:modal maximum repayment duration is 180 months (fifteen years).  
11:355:27940:21:21:108:478:460:144:Times:144:Times:A: Loan repayments are made with after-tax dollars and are not counted as plan 
11:356:28016:21:20:72:530:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributions (and thus do not count against annual plan contribution limits), even though both 
11:357:28112:20:21:72:531:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:the principal and interest payments are credited to participants’ accounts. Interest payments are 
11:358:28210:21:21:72:534:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:not tax deductible, even if the purpose of the loan was for a primary residence, because the loan 
11:359:28308:21:20:72:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:is not secured by the residence as the IRS requires for mortgage interest tax deductibility.  
11:360:28402:20:21:108:508:357:144:Times:144:Times:A: Plans have discretion in determining the interest rate for 401(k) loans, although the 
11:361:28488:21:21:72:529:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest rate chosen must be reasonable, meaning that it must be similar to what other financial 
11:362:28585:21:20:72:517:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:institutions are charging for similar types of loans. In practice, most savings plans that allow 
11:363:28682:20:21:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans peg their interest rate to the prime rate. In the most recent PSCA survey that reports how 
11:364:28779:21:21:72:533:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:plans determine their 401(k) loan interest rate, 86% of plans report pegging their interest rate to 
11:365:28879:21:21:72:524:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:the prime rate. In our sample of Aon Hewitt plan descriptions, 91% of plans peg their interest 
11:366:28974:21:20:72:540:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate to the prime rate (Table 1). There is, however, variation in the spread between the prime rate 
11:367:29074:20:21:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the 401(k) loan rate. Twenty-five percent of Aon Hewitt plans set their interest rate equal to 
11:368:29173:21:21:72:522:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:the prime rate, 60% set it to the prime rate plus 0 to 1% (not including 0), and 6% set it to the 
11:369:29271:21:20:72:517:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:prime rate plus 1 to 2% (not including 1). There is also some variation in the frequency with 
11:370:29365:20:30:72:524:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:which 401(k) loan interest rates are updated. Most (54%) of the Aon Hewitt plans adjust their 
11:371:29459:30:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
11:372:29507:7:16:72:529:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 In plans that do not offer both general purpose and primary residence loans, participants can apply for a general 
11:373:29624:16:12:71:488:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:purpose loan and use the proceeds for their primary residence. Such a loan would not require additional 
11:374:29728:12:11:71:518:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:documentation regarding its purpose and would have to be repaid in five years (or less, if the plan has a shorter 
11:375:29842:11:0:71:175:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:maximum loan duration). 
12:376:29868:0:20:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest rate monthly, but 33% adjust only quarterly, 5% adjust daily, and the rest adjust at some 
12:377:29967:20:21:72:522:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:other frequency (including one plan that adjusts only once a year). This increases variation in 
12:378:30063:21:21:72:540:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) loan interest rates across plans during periods when the prime rate is changing frequently. 
12:379:30162:21:20:108:526:646:144:Times:144:Times:A: We can look at the participant-level data from our sample of Aon Hewitt plans to get a 
12:380:30249:20:21:72:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:sense for how 401(k) interest rates vary across firms and how they have evolved over time. We 
12:381:30343:21:21:72:540:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:use the set of 27 plans at 25 companies for which we have year-end data in every year from 2002 
12:382:30439:21:20:72:511:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 2008. For each company, we calculate the modal interest rate of loans originated in each 
12:383:30531:20:21:72:497:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:month.20 Because we have data not only on newly originated loans, but also on all loans 
12:384:30619:21:21:72:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding at year-end, we can examine interest rates prevailing before the initial 2002 cross-
12:385:30715:21:21:72:532:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:section to the extent that loans taken out before that time have not yet been fully repaid by year-
12:386:30814:21:20:72:519:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:end 2002. This gives us a long time series of interest rates. Figure 5A shows, across these 27 
12:387:30909:20:21:72:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:plans, the median, 25th, and 75th percentile of firm-level modal interest rates by loan origination 
12:388:31009:21:21:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:month. The difference between the 25th and 75th percentile interest rates across firms is almost 
12:389:31106:21:20:72:525:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:always 100 basis points. As expected, given how 401(k) loan interest rates are set, the median 
12:390:31201:20:21:72:446:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest rate tracks the prime interest rate fairly closely, as seen in Figure 5B.  
12:391:31285:21:21:108:542:398:144:Times:144:Times:A: If a participant defaults on his or her loan, the outstanding balance at the time of default is 
12:392:31381:21:20:71:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:treated as a taxable distribution from the plan and is subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty 
12:393:31480:20:21:71:503:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:for participants under the age of 59½.21 If a participant’s employment is terminated, most 
12:394:31571:21:21:71:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:companies stipulate that the loan must be repaid in full within a reasonable period of time, or the 
12:395:31671:21:20:72:516:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding loan balance is treated as a taxable distribution from the plan. Some companies, 
12:396:31764:20:21:72:537:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, may allow terminated employees to continue repaying their 401(k) loans over a longer 
12:397:31858:21:21:71:522:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:period of time. The Aon Hewitt plan descriptions show some heterogeneity across firms as to 
12:398:31950:21:21:71:539:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:when a loan is deemed to be in default and when it becomes a taxable distribution, but generally, 
12:399:32048:21:20:71:486:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:terminated participants have 60 to 90 days to repay a loan before it becomes a taxable 
12:400:32135:20:21:71:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution. Current employees of the company have a similar amount of time to become current 
12:401:32230:21:25:71:269:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:on a loan whose payments are in arrears. 
12:402:32271:25:7:216:219:166:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
12:403:32319:7:16:72:541:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 There tends to be little heterogeneity in interest rates among loans originated in a particular plan in a given month. 
12:404:32441:16:12:72:535:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:However, loan interest rates can vary within a plan for a given month due to within-month movements in the prime 
12:405:32554:12:11:72:537:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:rate, differential delays between loan application and disbursement, and participants of acquired firms who took out 
12:406:32671:11:12:72:528:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:loans under their former plans. This is why we use the modal interest rate, which is almost always identical to the 
12:407:32787:12:11:72:542:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:median interest rate (and often is also the 5th percentile and 95th percentile interest rate) among loans originated in a 
12:408:32909:11:7:72:164:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:particular plan-month. 
12:409:32932:7:16:72:526:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 Plans may suspend loan payments for employees on active military duty. They may also suspend payments for 
12:410:33041:16:0:72:282:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:employees on non-military leave for up to one year.

13:412:33095:20:21:72:214:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:IV. 401(k) Loan Utilization 
13:413:33123:21:21:108:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:A: We now turn to an assessment of how individuals use 401(k) loans. Figure 6 plots the 
13:414:33208:21:20:72:515:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of 401(k) participants in plans with a loan option who have at least one outstanding 
13:415:33302:20:21:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) loan, as reported by the PSCA, as reported by the Investment Company Institute (using 
13:416:33395:21:21:72:533:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the EBRI/ICI data), and from our own calculations using the Aon Hewitt participant-level data. 
13:417:33490:21:20:72:540:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the EBRI/ICI data, the fraction of participants with a loan has been relatively stable over time, 
13:418:33591:20:21:72:527:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:ranging between 16% and 21%. The fraction of participants with a loan is somewhat higher in 
13:419:33683:21:21:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the PSCA surveys, ranging from 19% to 33%, although it stabilized around 24% during the past 
13:420:33776:21:21:72:515:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:several years. In the Aon Hewitt data, a nearly constant 21% to 22% of participants have an 
13:421:33868:21:20:72:530:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding loan at year-end between 2002 and 2008.22 If we restrict the Aon Hewitt sample to 
13:422:33962:20:21:72:531:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants who remain employed at the same company for all seven years, an average of 31% 
13:423:34054:21:21:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:have a loan in any given year, but a much higher 44% have a loan at some point during the entire 
13:424:34151:21:20:72:530:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:seven-year period. Annual loan utilization figures are thus likely to substantially understate the 
13:425:34250:20:21:72:503:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of participants who could be affected by a change in plan loan policies or federal 
13:426:34342:21:21:72:208:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulations of 401(k) loans. 
13:427:34371:21:20:107:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:A: In the first two columns of Table 2, we report, separately by demographic characteristics, 
13:428:34462:20:21:72:541:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:the fraction of participants who have a 401(k) loan in 401(k) plans that allow loans. The numbers 
13:429:34560:21:21:72:540:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:in column 1 are from the EBRI/ICI data for calendar year 2008, and the numbers in column 2 are 
13:430:34655:21:20:72:523:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the Aon Hewitt participant-level data at year-end 2008. Loan utilization follows a hump 
13:431:34748:20:21:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern with respect to age, peaking in the 40s at 22% in the EBRI/ICI data and 26% in the Aon 
13:432:34843:21:21:72:500:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hewitt data. Employees in their 20s or 60s have substantially lower loan utilization rates 
13:433:34934:21:21:72:522:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(between 10% and 14%). Loan utilization also follows a hump pattern with respect to tenure, 
13:434:35026:21:20:72:533:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:peaking at 26% in the EBRI/ICI data and 33% in the Aon Hewitt data for employees with 10 to 
13:435:35118:20:21:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:20 years of tenure. Employees with two or fewer years of tenure have very low utilization rates, 
13:436:35215:21:21:72:521:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely reflecting the fact that employees must accumulate some balances in their savings plan 
13:437:35309:21:20:72:535:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:before they can take out a loan. Loan utilization rates are fairly flat around 25% (EBRI/ICI) and 
13:438:35407:20:21:72:517:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:30% (Aon Hewitt) across much of the distribution of plan assets, but show a marked decline 
13:439:35498:21:32:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:once plan balances exceed $200,000 or fall below $10,000. For low-balance participants, loan 
13:440:35591:32:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
13:441:35639:7:16:72:531:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 These numbers are very similar to the results of internal calculations by Aon Hewitt on the fraction of their plan 
13:442:35757:16:0:71:387:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:participants with a 401(k) loan over the same time period (Aon Hewitt, 2011). 
14:443:35837:0:20:72:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization is limited by institutional constraints. First, in most firms, taking out a loan is not 
14:444:35937:20:21:72:511:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:feasible until participants have reached a certain level of balances due to restrictions on the 
14:445:36033:21:21:72:535:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum loan size (see Table 1). Second, loans are restricted to be no more than 50% of vested 
14:446:36128:21:20:72:505:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances. This restriction, coupled with application fees, means that a 401(k) loan may be 
14:447:36219:20:21:72:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:economically unattractive for participants with low plan balances. Loan utilization rates are 
14:448:36313:21:21:72:533:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:highest for middle-income participants ($40,000 to $60,000 in annual compensation) and lower 
14:449:36406:21:20:72:338:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:for those with very low incomes or very high incomes. 
14:450:36460:20:21:108:532:564:144:Times:144:Times:A: Figure 7 plots the time series of average total outstanding loan balances divided by plan 
14:451:36550:21:21:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances among participants who have an outstanding 401(k) loan.23 In the EBRI/ICI data, loan 
14:452:36644:21:21:72:540:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances as a fraction of balances have varied between 12% and 16% over the 1996 to 2009 time 
14:453:36738:21:20:72:536:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:period but exhibit no clear trend. Our sample of Aon Hewitt participants shows a similar pattern 
14:454:36835:20:21:72:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:during the years it overlaps with the EBRI/ICI data, although the average loan-to-balance ratio is 
14:455:36934:21:21:71:242:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher, ranging from 19% to 23%.  
14:456:36968:21:20:107:528:439:144:Times:144:Times:A: As with loan utilization, there are significant differences in the size of outstanding loan 
14:457:37060:20:21:71:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances relative to 401(k) balances across different demographic groups. These are shown in the 
14:458:37157:21:21:71:530:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:third column of Table 2 using the EBRI/ICI data from 2008 and in the fourth column using the 
14:459:37250:21:20:71:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Aon Hewitt data at year-end 2008. In both data sets, loan balances relative to plan balances 
14:460:37343:20:21:71:325:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:decrease with age, tenure, plan balances, and salary. 
14:461:37397:21:21:107:532:336:144:Times:144:Times:A: Figure 8 shows the average nominal dollar value of outstanding 401(k) loan balances as 
14:462:37484:21:20:71:537:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported by the PSCA, reported by the Investment Company Institute (using the EBRI/ICI data), 
14:463:37578:20:21:71:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:and from our own calculations using the Aon Hewitt data. Average outstanding balances are very 
14:464:37673:21:21:71:532:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar across all three data sources and are about $7,500 in 2008. They have increased slightly 
14:465:37770:21:21:71:475:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:over time in the EBRI/ICI data and somewhat more substantially in the PSCA data. 
14:466:37851:21:20:107:522:232:144:Times:144:Times:A: Table 3 shows the distribution of the number of loans per participant in our 2008 Aon 
14:467:37937:20:21:71:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hewitt participant-level sample, separately by the maximum number of loans allowed by the 
14:468:38027:21:21:71:508:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan. There is no clear relationship between the number of loans allowed by a plan and the 
14:469:38118:21:20:71:541:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:fraction of participants with an outstanding loan; loan utilization is highest in the plans that allow 
14:470:38221:20:30:71:525:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:a maximum of two loans. The last two columns of Table 3 show the average total outstanding 
14:471:38312:30:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
14:472:38360:7:16:72:526:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 For participants with more than one 401(k) loan outstanding at a given time, the numerator sums loan balances 
14:473:38473:16:12:71:509:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:across all the participant’s outstanding loans. The denominator reflects total plan balances that do not net out 
14:474:38586:12:11:71:521:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:outstanding loan balances. Private correspondence with Jack VanDerhei indicates that the Investment Company 
14:475:38694:11:0:71:447:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Institute reports erroneously describe the EBRI/ICI denominator as netting out loan balances. 
15:476:38790:0:20:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan to balance ratio and the average total outstanding loan balance by the number of outstanding 
15:477:38888:20:21:72:530:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans held by participants. Both the loan to balance ratio and the total outstanding loan balance 
15:478:38986:21:21:72:525:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase with the number of loans outstanding. Among participants with only one outstanding 
15:479:39078:21:20:72:520:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan, loans represent 16% to 19% of total balances; among participants with two outstanding 
15:480:39170:20:21:72:492:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans, loans represent 24% to 27% of total balances; and among participants with three 
15:481:39257:21:21:72:518:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:outstanding loans, loans represent 29% of total balances. Average outstanding loan balances 
15:482:39349:21:20:72:495:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:range from $5,305 to $11,225 among participants with only one loan to $16,779 among 
15:483:39433:20:21:72:214:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants with three loans. 
15:484:39464:21:21:108:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:A: Because many of the demographic characteristics associated with loan utilization and the 
15:485:39553:21:21:72:493:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:size of loan balances are highly correlated with each other, Table 4 reports results from 
15:486:39643:21:20:72:525:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:regressions of loan utilization and loan balances as a fraction of total balances (conditional on 
15:487:39741:20:21:72:505:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:having a loan outstanding) on demographic and plan characteristics using the Aon Hewitt 
15:488:39829:21:21:72:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:participant-level data from the year-end closest to the date of the plan description that we have 
15:489:39927:21:20:72:494:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2002, 2003 or 2004).24 The sample in these regressions—participants in 87 plans at 79 
15:490:40014:20:21:72:515:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:companies that offer loans—is much larger than in our previous analysis because we do not 
15:491:40104:21:21:72:529:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:require continuous data coverage from 2002 to 2008. Columns 1 and 2 show linear probability 
15:492:40196:21:20:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression coefficients and standard errors where the dependent variable is a dummy for having a 
15:493:40293:20:21:72:505:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:401(k) loan outstanding and the only explanatory variables are dummies for demographic 
15:494:40380:21:21:72:521:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics. Columns 3 and 4 add a set of plan loan feature dummy variables: whether the 
15:495:40473:21:20:72:529:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan offers primary residence loans, the maximum number of loans permitted by the plan, how 
15:496:40565:20:21:72:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:the loan interest rate is set, whether there is an application fee, whether the minimum loan 
15:497:40658:21:21:72:537:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount for a general purpose loan is greater than $500, the minimum loan duration for a general 
15:498:40754:21:21:72:521:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:purpose loan, and whether the maximum loan duration for a general purpose loan is less than 
15:499:40846:21:20:72:512:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:five years. In columns 5 and 6, the dependent variable is loan balances as a fraction of total 
15:500:40941:20:21:72:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances, and the only explanatory variables are demographic variables; columns 7 and 8 add 
15:501:41033:21:21:72:177:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan feature controls. 
15:502:41056:21:20:108:519:170:144:Times:144:Times:A: Some of the coefficients on the demographic variables show patterns that differ from 
15:503:41141:20:30:72:515:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:those shown in Table 2. Instead of following a hump shape, the probability of having a loan 
15:504:41233:30:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
15:505:41281:7:16:72:530:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 Because plans change their provisions over time, restricting the data to the year-end extract that is closest to the 
15:506:41401:16:12:71:522:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:plan description date reduces measurement error in the plan variables. This means that the data in the regression 
15:507:41515:12:11:71:528:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:come from different years. The statistics on loan utilization in the Aon Hewitt and EBRI/ICI data are fairly stable 
15:508:41631:11:0:71:472:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:over time, so some mixing across the relatively short span of three years should not be problematic. 
16:509:41734:0:20:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:increases with tenure and decreases with compensation. The loan-to-total balance ratio is hump-
16:510:41829:20:21:72:529:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:shaped with respect to age and increasing with respect to compensation, rather than decreasing 
16:511:41924:21:21:72:509:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:with respect to these variables. Using administrative data from Vanguard, Mitchell and Lu 
16:512:42014:21:20:72:530:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2010) find similar relationships between demographic characteristics and loan utilization. The 
16:513:42110:20:21:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:patterns of the demographic coefficients do not change much when the plan feature controls are 
16:514:42205:21:21:72:107:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:added. 
16:515:42212:21:20:108:520:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:A few interesting patterns emerge from the coefficients on the 401(k) loan features in 
16:516:42299:20:21:72:510:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:columns 3 and 7 of Table 4. Conditional on demographic characteristics, the probability of 
16:517:42390:21:21:71:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:having a loan outstanding decreases with the loan interest rate; participants in plans that charge 
16:518:42489:21:21:71:525:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:more than prime plus one are 10 percentage points less likely to borrow against their balances 
16:519:42584:21:20:71:532:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:than participants in plans that charge only the prime rate. However, the size of loans that do get 
16:520:42683:20:21:71:537:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:taken out are slightly larger (4% of total balances) in plans that charge more than prime plus one 
16:521:42782:21:21:71:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:than in plans that charge the prime rate. Mitchell and Lu (2010) also find that a higher loan 
16:522:42876:21:20:71:523:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest rate is related to a lower probability of having a 401(k) loan but a higher loan balance 
16:523:42974:20:21:71:526:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditional on having a loan. Imposing a maximum general purpose loan duration of less than 
16:524:43066:21:21:71:529:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:five years is associated with a decrease in loan size of 2% of total balances, and allowing more 
16:525:43163:21:20:71:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans outstanding is associated with larger loan-to-balance ratios. Surprisingly, the probability of 
16:526:43264:20:21:71:540:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:having a loan is highest in plans that allow up to two loans outstanding as compared to plans that 
16:527:43363:21:21:72:509:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:allow either only one or more than two loans outstanding. It is difficult to think of a causal 
16:528:43458:21:20:72:523:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanism running from number of loans allowed to loan utilization that would generate this 
16:529:43550:20:21:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern. Similarly, the negative correlation between the probability of loan utilization and the 
16:530:43647:21:21:72:498:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:option to take out a primary residence loan seems unlikely to be caused by the loan rule. 
16:531:43737:21:21:108:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:A: Table 5 reports the distribution of characteristics for 401(k) loans originated from 2002 to 
16:532:43830:21:20:72:533:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008 in our Aon Hewitt participant-level data. The sample is again restricted to the 27 plans for 
16:533:43928:20:21:72:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:which we have continuous data coverage over the entire time span. The vast majority of loans—
16:534:44021:21:21:72:530:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:97%—are general purpose loans rather than primary residence loans.25 The administrative data 
16:535:44114:21:20:72:506:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:give no further insights into the purposes for which individuals take out 401(k) loans. The 
16:536:44206:20:21:71:530:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Survey of Consumer Finances, however, does collect more detailed information on the reasons 
16:537:44298:21:32:71:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:why individuals borrow from their retirement savings plans. These are presented in Table 6 for 
16:538:44393:32:7:216:219:97:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
16:539:44441:7:16:72:525:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:25 Utkus and Young (2010) and Lu and Mitchell (2010) report that a similarly high fraction of loans in Vanguard 
16:540:44553:16:0:71:285:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:administered savings plan are general purpose loans. 
17:541:44608:0:20:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1998, 2001, 2004 and 2007. Note that there is quite a bit of variability over time in the reasons 
17:542:44706:20:21:72:498:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:for taking out a 401(k) loan.26 Interestingly, in some years up to one third of 401(k) loan 
17:543:44798:21:21:72:537:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:recipients report using a 401(k) loan for either a home purchase or home improvement, uses that 
17:544:44894:21:20:72:537:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:would potentially qualify for a longer-term primary residence loan. This far exceeds the fraction 
17:545:44992:20:21:72:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of individuals in the Aon Hewitt administrative data who take out a primary residence loan. 
17:546:45084:21:21:72:540:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:These findings are not necessarily inconsistent. Individuals could take out a general purpose loan 
17:547:45183:21:20:71:529:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:and use the proceeds for a primary residence; in this case, they would simply have to repay the 
17:548:45279:20:21:71:525:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan within the five-year maximum legal time limit (or sooner, if their plan specifies a shorter 
17:549:45376:21:21:71:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximum repayment period). The advantage of doing this is that a general purpose loan requires 
17:550:45471:21:21:71:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:less documentation and, in some plans, also has a lower application fee. Other significant reasons 
17:551:45570:21:20:72:531:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:cited for obtaining a 401(k) loan include the purchase of a vehicle or other durable goods (10% 
17:552:45666:20:21:72:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 23%); education and medical expenses (5% to 16%); and occasional expenses like a wedding 
17:553:45758:21:21:72:194:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:or divorce (6% to 12%).  
17:554:45783:21:20:108:524:439:144:Times:144:Times:A:Utkus and Young (2010) analyze the use of loan proceeds in a 2008 survey of savings 
17:555:45867:20:21:72:497:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan participants and find broadly similar results. In contrast to the Survey of Consumer 
17:556:45957:21:21:72:520:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Finances, their survey allows respondents to specify multiple uses for the proceeds of a loan. 
17:557:46052:21:20:72:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:They find that 40% of respondents borrow from their savings plan for investment purposes 
17:558:46141:20:21:72:515:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:(including home purchases or improvements, vehicle purchases, and educational expenses), 
17:559:46230:21:21:72:528:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:while 39% report borrowing to consolidate bills or pay off other bills. Few report using 401(k) 
17:560:46326:21:20:72:539:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans purely for consumption reasons. Many of the loan expenditure categories in Table 6 and in 
17:561:46422:20:21:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Utkus and Young (2010) represent items frequently financed with loans, suggesting that 401(k) 
17:562:46516:21:21:72:461:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans may be substituting for other sources of credit at potentially better terms.27 
17:563:46600:21:21:107:519:253:144:Times:144:Times:A: As shown in Table 5, the median size of a newly originated loan in 2008 was $4,000, 
17:564:46684:21:20:72:532:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:with a 5th percentile amount of $1,050 and a 95th percentile amount of $26,000. Over the 2002 
17:565:46778:20:21:72:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 2008 time period covered by our data, less than 1% of loans were made for $50,000, the 
17:566:46868:21:21:72:540:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximum legal amount. More were surely made at the 50% of plan balances threshold, although 
17:567:46960:21:20:72:539:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:we cannot assess how binding that constraint is on loan size since we do not have balance data at 
17:568:47058:20:30:72:308:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:exactly the time each participant took out a loan. 
17:569:47109:30:7:216:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
17:570:47157:7:12:72:407:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 Li and Smith (2010) find similar variability in the reasons for 401(k) loan taking. 
17:571:47244:12:16:72:530:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 Li and Smith (2010) argue that households could be even more aggressive in substituting 401(k) loans for other 
17:572:47358:16:11:71:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:sources of credit. According to their estimates, such substitutions could save households with 401(k) loans available 
17:573:47476:11:0:71:243:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:to them $200 to $275 per year on average. 
18:574:47520:0:20:108:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:A: Despite the fact that most plans do allow participants to take out a general purpose loan 
18:575:47610:20:21:72:509:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the full legal maximum duration of five years, most participants choose a much shorter 
18:576:47701:21:21:72:523:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:repayment period. In 2008, 19% of loans were taken out with a repayment period of less than 
18:577:47793:21:20:72:489:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:two years; another 18% had a repayment period of two to three years. Only 26% had a 
18:578:47877:20:21:72:266:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:repayment period of five years or more. 
18:579:47917:21:21:108:535:605:144:Times:144:Times:A: The distribution of interest rates for new loans originated between 2002 and 2008 is also 
18:580:48007:21:20:72:539:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in Table 5.28 Over the entire 2002 to 2008 period, interest rates largely fall in the range of 
18:581:48108:20:21:72:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.00% to 9.25%. The median monthly repayment amount for new loans is $130 in 2008, but the 
18:582:48199:21:21:72:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:5th percentile repayment amount is just $31 per month, whereas the 95th percentile repayment 
18:583:48292:21:21:72:204:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount is $603 per month.

18:585:48320:20:21:72:147:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:V. Conclusion 
18:586:48334:21:21:108:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:A: This paper has documented the types of loan provisions in 401(k) savings plans and how 
18:587:48421:21:20:72:530:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants use 401(k) loans. While a minority of savings plan participants use 401(k) loans at 
18:588:48518:20:21:72:541:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:any given point in time—about 22% in our calculations based on participant-level data from Aon 
18:589:48613:21:21:72:521:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hewitt—a much higher fraction will use a 401(k) loan over a longer period of time—slightly 
18:590:48704:21:20:72:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:fewer than half of those whom we observe over a seven-year period from 2002 through 2008. 
18:591:48794:20:21:107:489:357:144:Times:144:Times:A: 401(k) loan utilization varies with demographic characteristics. The fraction of 
18:592:48875:21:21:71:518:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:participants with a loan at a point in time follows a hump-shaped pattern with respect to age, 
18:593:48970:21:20:71:529:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:tenure, salary, and plan balances, whereas the size of outstanding loan balances as a fraction of 
18:594:49068:20:21:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:plan balances (conditional on having a loan outstanding) is decreasing in these characteristics. 
18:595:49165:21:21:72:537:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:When these variables are controlled for simultaneously in a regression, the probability of having 
18:596:49263:21:21:72:521:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:a loan is still hump-shaped with respect to age and balances, but it is increasing in tenure and 
18:597:49360:21:20:72:539:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreasing in compensation; normalized loan size conditional on having a loan is still decreasing 
18:598:49458:20:21:72:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:with respect to tenure and balances, but hump-shaped with respect to age and increasing with 
18:599:49551:21:21:72:512:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:respect to compensation. Some plan characteristics are also correlated with loan utilization. 
18:600:49645:21:20:72:541:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:Participants are less likely to use a loan in plans that charge a higher interest rate, and conditional 
18:601:49749:20:21:72:536:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:on having a loan, total loan balances are smaller as a fraction of plan balances when fewer loans
