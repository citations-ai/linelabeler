2:22:965:35:23:108:539:575:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:This paper discusses the potential impacts of services trade liberalization on developing

2:24:1165:23:23:72:540:529:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:literature rather than to advocate specific policy changes. The picture emerging is one of valiant
2:25:1263:23:22:71:539:506:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:attempts to quantify in the presence of formidable analytical and data problems yielding only a

3:35:1576:15:15:107:110:691:195:g_d0_f3:195:g_d0_f3:C: 
3:36:1576:15:27:90:192:676:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:1.1  Background 
3:37:1591:27:28:117:487:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This paper assesses the present state of quantitative literature which seeks to 
3:38:1671:28:28:90:464:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evaluate the potential impacts which would follow from global services trade 
3:39:1748:28:27:90:520:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization as it relates to developing countries.  It is important to emphasize that what 
3:40:1842:27:28:90:507:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are frequently referred to as developing countries are themselves also a heterogeneous 
3:41:1929:28:27:90:495:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:group of countries.  They span rapidly growing economies in Asia, negative growth 
3:42:2011:27:28:90:516:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economies (in GDP/capita) in Africa, middle income and very poor countries, small and 
3:43:2097:28:28:90:511:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large, landlocked and ocean access; heavily regulated and recently liberalized.  I prefer 
3:44:2187:28:27:90:480:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the term poorer countries, and use this interchangeably with the term developing 
3:45:2268:27:28:90:524:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries in the text.  Much of the literature at issue is relatively recent, and is scattered in 
3:46:2366:28:27:90:502:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:working papers and other less accessible sources.  Policy makers clearly need help in 
3:47:2452:27:28:90:474:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unraveling this at times confusing and fragmentary picture of what the research 
3:48:2532:28:28:90:502:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:community has to offer to guide their deliberations.  This paper aims to do this rather 
3:49:2620:28:27:90:460:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than to advocate particular policy positions on global services liberalization. 
3:50:2700:27:28:117:120:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: 
3:51:2700:28:27:90:223:262:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:1.2 Nature of Services 
3:52:2722:27:28:126:500:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The paper begins by characterizing services as a majority of activity for most 
3:53:2801:28:27:90:514:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:OECD economies (as measured by employment, and by value added originating), and a 
3:54:2883:27:28:90:521:180:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:smaller but still large portion of activity for poorer developing countries.  It suggests that 
3:55:2978:28:28:90:478:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:so-called “core” services can best be thought of (see Melvin 1989) as relating to 
3:56:3060:28:27:90:498:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intermediation through time (banking, insurance) or space (telecoms, transportation, 
3:57:3145:27:0:90:515:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retailing, wholesaling), with a wide range of diverse additional service items making up 
4:58:3235:0:27:90:485:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the balance of what most people refer to as services (tourism, consulting services, 
4:59:3319:27:28:90:500:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:government services, utilities).  This diverse range of activities is typically treated in 
4:60:3410:28:27:90:499:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative studies as a single homogenous entity, frequently labeled as services for 
4:61:3497:27:28:90:513:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analytical convenience, when in fact its heterogeneity suggests a different treatment for 
4:62:3587:28:28:90:514:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:each.  This heterogeneity is, in my view, key to better understanding how services trade 
4:63:3676:28:27:90:301:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization could affect poorer countries.

4:65:3722:28:27:90:366:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:1.3 Impacts of Liberalization on Poorer Countries 
4:66:3771:27:28:89:503:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: There is a general presumption in the poorer countries that they will lose from 
4:67:3851:28:28:89:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:global services trade liberalization since their domestic service industries are inefficient 
4:68:3944:28:27:89:521:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and non-competitive.  This view is despite the arguments from economists as to the gains 
4:69:4033:27:28:89:498:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to domestic consumers from lower prices and the joint benefits which accrue to both 
4:70:4117:28:27:89:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exporting and importing countries from exploiting comparative advantage and improved 
4:71:4202:27:28:89:509:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market access opportunities abroad.  It is also despite the commonly held view that the 
4:72:4290:28:27:89:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:production of many services are labour intensive, which economists believe should be the 
4:73:4379:27:28:89:514:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:source of comparative advantage for poorer developing countries in services provision.  
4:74:4467:28:28:89:502:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There unfortunately appear to be few if no studies of the relative inefficiency of local 
4:75:4556:28:27:89:512:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:versus foreign service providers in developing country service markets which allow the 
4:76:4643:27:28:89:408:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strength of these arguments to be evaluated on empirical grounds. 
4:77:4709:28:27:89:515:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: This caution towards global services trade liberalization in the developing world 
4:78:4791:27:28:89:505:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seems to reflect two concerns.  One is the general assumption in the developing world 
4:79:4877:28:28:89:518:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that any future negotiated global liberalization of services trade will be largely one sided 
4:80:4970:28:0:89:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the results it will yield.  Their belief is that  if new WTO multilateral (or even regional) 
5:81:5067:0:27:90:519:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services liberalization is negotiated, developed country service providers will likely gain 
5:82:5159:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly improved access to developing country service markets, but the converse 
5:83:5245:28:27:90:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(significantly improved access for developing country service providers to developed 
5:84:5330:27:28:90:519:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:country service markets) will likely not happen.  Asymmetry in negotiating power is one 
5:85:5418:28:28:90:506:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reason cited for this possible outcome.  The presumption is that the present regulatory 
5:86:5506:28:27:90:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:structure for most service market segments will remain in place in OECD countries, and 
5:87:5593:27:28:90:501:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:few significant improvements in access to developed country markets for developing 
5:88:5676:28:27:90:508:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:country service providers will occur.  This outcome, for instance, is reflected in recent 
5:89:5766:27:28:90:382:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:US bilateral agreements, including the US-Chile agreement. 
5:90:5825:28:28:126:485:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In reality, through the process of ongoing regulatory reform in the OECD, 
5:91:5899:28:27:90:505:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:changes are in fact being made in market access arrangements for developing country 
5:92:5983:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service providers, though these are not necessarily reflected in scheduled commitments in 
5:93:6073:28:27:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:GATS in the WTO.  Another important and neglected dimension to this conclusion is 
5:94:6155:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:South-South trade, and the potential that developing countries have much to gain from 
5:95:6241:28:27:90:497:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization of markets in other developing countries.  The point is that in terms of 
5:96:6329:27:28:90:514:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model based (or quantitative) evaluations of the impacts of services trade liberalization, 
5:97:6420:28:28:90:518:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were genuine two sided liberalization to take place with their low wage rates developing 
5:98:6509:28:27:90:523:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:country providers could well benefit.  This is especially so if there are scale economies in 
5:99:6602:27:28:90:500:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service provision (as in banking, for instance).  Most of the available studies of what 
5:100:6690:28:27:89:500:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits might flow from services liberalization assume there will be full multilateral 
5:101:6778:27:28:89:495:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:opening of service markets, and results of studies must be interpreted in light of this 
5:102:6866:28:0:89:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presumption.  If one-sided liberalization is the expected outcome, developing countries 
6:103:6955:0:27:90:519:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may well remain opposed to liberalization on the grounds it is non-reciprocal despite the 
6:104:7045:27:28:90:177:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:results of studies. 
6:105:7065:28:27:90:521:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The second caution that developing countries express is the nature and size of the 
6:106:7148:27:28:90:488:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adjustments in domestic economies which services liberalization may imply.  One 
6:107:7228:28:28:90:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dimension of adjustment relates to potential foreign majority ownership and control of 
6:108:7315:28:27:90:515:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provision in key service sectors, and the related security and cultural concerns.  Foreign 
6:109:7406:27:28:90:494:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entities having access to and control over bank records and financial information of 
6:110:7491:28:27:90:492:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:domestic residents, for instance, is seen in some countries as unacceptable.  Also, a 
6:111:7577:27:28:90:486:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:vibrant and vital domestic broadcast or film industry may be viewed as integral to 
6:112:7660:28:28:90:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:national cultural identity.  Added to such concerns is the potential size of labour market 
6:113:7751:28:27:90:490:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:adjustments if domestic banks are displaced by foreign banks, domestic by foreign 
6:114:7833:27:28:90:503:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:airlines, and other large changes in the organization of labour intensive sectors which 
6:115:7921:28:27:90:250:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:might follow after liberalization.

6:118:7989:27:28:90:513:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Against this background, the paper identifies three central issues which existing 
6:119:8071:28:28:90:485:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature on the quantification of the potential benefits to developing countries of 
6:120:8157:28:27:90:513:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade liberalization raises.  For simplicity in the discussion of studies I assume, 
6:121:8250:27:28:90:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as in the literature, that this is in fact multilateral liberalization rather than the unilateral 
6:122:8348:28:27:90:424:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization developing countries presume it may well be in reality. 
6:123:8419:27:28:90:516:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The first is the representation of and measurement of barriers to services trade in 
6:124:8503:28:28:90:497:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individual countries, and the associated issue of measuring the size of services trade 
6:125:8590:28:0:90:497:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:itself.  Both the level and composition of global services trade is poorly measured at 
7:126:8678:0:27:90:520:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:present because there is no formal customs clearance for services trade.  Despite this, the 
7:127:8770:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature consensus is that services trade is large (the WTO put it at 30% of combined 
7:128:8858:28:27:90:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade in goods and services), and growing (at perhaps double the rate of goods trade). 
7:129:8945:27:28:90:512:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Current information on barriers to flows of services trade reflects a number of sources.  
7:130:9035:28:28:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:One measures the quantity impacts from various restrictions as estimated by economic 
7:131:9120:28:27:90:503:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:models.  Another uses estimates of price differentials for across domestic and foreign 
7:132:9207:27:28:90:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service providers across national markets.  Yet another is frequency data showing how 
7:133:9293:28:27:90:515:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:often regulatory measures are used in particular service segments in particular countries 
7:134:9383:27:28:90:498:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(see Hoekman (1995)).  Tax equivalents are used in some of the literature to capture 
7:135:9468:28:28:90:507:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associated barriers to FDI flows which might otherwise accompany freer service trade 
7:136:9553:28:27:90:272:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows (see Dee and Hanslow (2000)). 
7:137:9589:27:28:126:513:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the paper I suggest that these are major conceptual problems with all of these 
7:138:9671:28:27:90:522:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates of the size of barriers, while acknowledging that no other meaningful data exist 
7:139:9762:27:29:90:485:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which can be used and many problems inevitably arise with whatever approach is 
7:140:9841:29:28:90:495:321:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:followed.  By way of illustration, frequency data1 do not allow users to differentiate 
7:141:9928:28:28:89:501:293:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between those barriers which restrict trade (i.e. are binding constraints on trade), and 
7:142:10017:28:27:89:480:265:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those which do not restrict trade because they are redundant (i.e. are non binding 
7:143:10100:27:28:89:515:238:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constraints).  Neither do studies substantively enumerate and represent the various ways 
7:144:10189:28:28:89:493:210:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in which restrictions on services trade apply and how these affect the assessment of 
7:145:10274:28:27:89:515:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impact, nor do they assess the relative severity of barriers.  To an economist working on 
7:146:10364:27:28:89:514:155:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the impacts of distortions of trade, available barrier estimates from frequency data in no 
7:147:10455:28:29:89:519:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:way provide meaningful estimates of marginal barriers to trade.  Another example is that 
7:148:10544:29:8:89:237:98:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
7:149:10592:8:16:90:489:90:42:Symbol:100:g_d0_f3:F:1 The UNCTAD MAST (Measures Affecting Services Trade) dataset is one of the more recent and 
7:150:10684:16:0:90:269:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:comprehensive of these frequency data sets. 
8:151:10729:0:27:90:503:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:if data on costs of service provision in different markets are obtained, any differences 
8:152:10818:27:28:90:514:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across markets may merely reflect differences in domestic regulatory environments and 
8:153:10904:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not barriers to entry for foreign service providers.  Price differences across countries for 
8:154:10997:27:28:90:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services can also reflect quality differentials across countries rather than barriers.  Using 
8:155:11091:28:28:90:500:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model results to infer barriers to trade can yield outcomes that quantity impacts from 
8:156:11178:28:27:90:482:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers may be negative from model residuals even where it is clear that binding 
8:157:11260:27:28:90:212:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restraints on trade apply. 
8:158:11287:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: A second issue discussed is the interpretation of results from existing model based 
8:159:11371:27:28:90:522:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature seeking to quantify the impacts of trade liberalization in services (see Robinson 
8:160:11464:28:28:90:518:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:et al (1999), Dee and Hanslow (2000) and Brown, Deardorff and Stern (2002)).  Most of 
8:161:11550:28:27:90:523:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:what is available involves numerical simulation exercises using (typically global) general 
8:162:11641:27:28:90:508:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium models based on conventional models of trade liberalization in goods (see 
8:163:11727:28:27:90:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Whalley (1985)).  In these exercises, producer services are typically identified as an input 
8:164:11820:27:28:90:512:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:into intermediate production and barriers to service trade are represented in the form of 
8:165:11910:28:27:90:519:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:advalorem tariff like restrictions.  These can be in tax equivalent (for FDI flows) or tariff 
8:166:12004:27:28:90:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent (for service flows) form.  The size of initial barriers, how they change under 
8:167:12094:28:28:90:519:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization, elasticities, and the size of service trade flows, along with relative country 
8:168:12189:28:27:90:471:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:size and any differences in market structure then determines results much as in 
8:169:12269:27:28:90:267:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conventional goods models of trade. 
8:170:12305:28:27:90:489:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Several problems are encountered in interpreting the results from available 
8:171:12381:27:28:90:495:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies.  One is that even taken on their own merits results appear to be confusingly 
8:172:12467:28:28:90:512:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contradictory, and especially so for individual developing countries.  For example, Dee 
8:173:12555:28:0:90:485:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Hanslow (2000) produce results showing extremely large gains from services 
9:174:12635:0:27:90:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization in the Uruguay Round for certain developing countries (a 14.6% of GDP 
9:175:12720:27:28:90:514:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain for China, and 5.1% gain for Indonesia).  They also suggest globally, that over one 
9:176:12809:28:27:90:471:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:half the total gains from goods and services liberalization accrue from services 
9:177:12890:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization.  In contrast, Robinson et al (1999) using similar GTAP data put the gains 
9:178:12980:28:28:90:493:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to China at 0.34% of GDP, ASEAN and 1.29%, and South Asia at 1.13%.  Another 
9:179:13057:28:27:90:497:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example is that Verikios and Zhang (2000) suggest losses to Malaysia from telecom 
9:180:13139:27:28:90:500:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization, and losses to Indonesia from financial services liberalization using the 
9:181:13228:28:27:90:489:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same data as Dee and Hanslow.  They show only small gains for China.  There are 
9:182:13308:27:28:90:505:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:important differences in approach between these studies.  Dee and Hanslow explicitly 
9:183:13393:28:28:90:504:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incorporate GATS mode 3 restrictions while Robinson et al. use a modeling approach 
9:184:13476:28:27:90:512:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which does not differentiate between cross country factor flows and provision of goods 
9:185:13563:27:28:90:508:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and services.  Also, different estimates of barriers are incorporated in the two models.  
9:186:13653:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Brown, Deardorff and Stern suggest global gains from Doha Round liberalization of $574 
9:187:13740:27:28:90:494:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion per year with the large majority ($413 billion) arising from services, and the 
9:188:13827:28:27:90:516:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:largest absolute gains going to developed countries.  Fully explaining all the differences 
9:189:13918:27:28:90:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the magnitude of the results is difficult, and reconciling disparities in results is difficult 
9:190:14016:28:28:90:336:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when seemingly similar data sources are involved. 
9:191:14066:28:27:90:515:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Another problem is that there is analytical literature which purports to show that 
9:192:14149:27:28:90:496:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when intermediation services are explicitly represented in their true economic form, 
9:193:14234:28:27:90:483:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rather then being represented in advalorem equivalent form, the two fundamental 
9:194:14314:27:28:90:519:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:theorems of welfare economies need not hold.  Because of this property, welfare impacts 
9:195:14402:28:28:90:497:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from liberalization in services trade (even in small open economies) can be negative 
9:196:14487:28:0:90:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rather than positive as generally presumed in the goods like models used in the literature.  
10:197:14581:0:27:90:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Ryan (1990) was an early piece to point this out.  Chia and Whalley (1997) provide an 
10:198:14667:27:28:90:520:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example of welfare worsening liberalization in the case of trade liberalization in banking 
10:199:14758:28:27:90:482:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services.  Bhatterai and Whalley (1998) show how explicitly modelling telecoms 
10:200:14837:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization in a network structure can change perceptions as to the division of the gains 
10:201:14930:28:28:90:515:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from liberalization between small and large countries.  The implication seems to be that 
10:202:15019:28:27:90:473:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only limited confidence can be attached to results obtained from the advalorem 
10:203:15098:27:28:90:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent modelling used in numerical literature because the analytical structures used 
10:204:15187:28:27:90:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rule out alterative results.  This problem would arise even were the results of individual 
10:205:15278:27:28:90:299:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies not contradictory one with another. 
10:206:15322:28:28:90:93:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
10:207:15322:28:27:90:286:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:1.5 Key Features of Model Results 
10:208:15355:27:28:90:506:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Despite these problems, even though they are contradictory across countries, a 
10:209:15434:28:27:90:496:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:central broad feature of results taken as a whole is that in models where services are 
10:210:15521:27:28:90:516:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:treated as akin to goods and there is no factor mobility, effects are positive but small for 
10:211:15614:28:27:90:506:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:most countries.  However, where FDI flows enter (effectively capturing capital flows) 
10:212:15700:27:28:90:516:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects are much larger and more variable across countries.  This suggests that it may be 
10:213:15790:28:28:90:509:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the case that as surrogate liberalization of global factor markets, services liberalization 
10:214:15882:28:27:90:508:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:can have big effects and this could be the best way to view it in assessing the potential 
10:215:15972:27:28:90:506:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impacts on poorer developing countries.  Both some earlier and recent models capture 
10:216:16057:28:27:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:FDI effects (effectively GATS Mode 3 commercial presence and ownership restrictions) 
10:217:16142:27:28:90:503:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and more recent work captures labour mobility effects (GATS Mode 4 restrictions on 
10:218:16225:28:28:90:503:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mobility of service providers).  Existing literature estimates suggest very large global 
10:219:16314:28:0:90:487:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains from the removal of immigration restrictions to cross border flows of labour 
11:220:16399:0:27:90:492:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services, and seem to point to a conclusion that this could be the biggest part of the 
11:221:16486:27:28:90:471:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services liberalization nexus for developing countries.  It perhaps suggests that 
11:222:16568:28:27:90:518:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries should push for immigration and worker mobility restrictions to be 
11:223:16656:27:28:90:485:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:included in GATS negotiations in the WTO, even though developed countries are 
11:224:16734:28:28:90:210:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cautious about doing so. 
11:225:16759:28:27:90:463:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The paper also discusses recent econometric literature linking growth 
11:226:16829:27:28:90:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance to services trade liberalization (see Francois and Schuknecht (1999) and 
11:227:16914:28:27:90:499:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mattoo, Rathindran, and Subramanian (2001)).  Importantly, Mattoo et al, claim that 
11:228:16998:27:28:90:502:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth rates of up to 1.5 percentage points higher occur for economies that liberalize 
11:229:17085:28:28:90:520:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their telecoms and financial services sectors:  Francois and Schuknecht also claim strong 
11:230:17175:28:27:90:484:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth effects follow empirically from services liberalizations.  While seemingly 
11:231:17257:27:28:90:517:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:powerful in their policy thrust, there are problems once again in interpreting the results.  
11:232:17350:28:27:90:511:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:One is that excluded variables can be the larger source of higher growth.  For example, 
11:233:17438:27:28:90:490:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher growth rates may largely reflect higher savings and investment rates, which 
11:234:17521:28:27:90:517:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generate more intermediation and hence more service use.  So it could be that the higher 
11:235:17610:27:28:90:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment rates drive higher growth rates more so than larger use of services following 
11:236:17699:28:28:90:510:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:upon liberalization.  This work is also generally a theoretical and does not differentiate 
11:237:17790:28:27:90:517:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between once and for all level effects from liberalization and permanent growth effects.  
11:238:17880:27:28:90:482:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:It also needs to be borne in mind that endogenous growth literature also provides 
11:239:17962:28:27:90:497:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:arguments as to why protection can be welfare improving if there are uninternalized 
11:240:18046:27:28:90:514:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:externalities (as in so-called A-K models) (see Young (1996)) and these may also apply 
11:241:18133:28:0:90:241:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to services as well as to goods. 
12:242:18168:0:27:90:491:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The bottom line conclusions offered are that while services liberalization is 
12:243:18246:27:28:90:499:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indeed an important issue for developing countries, the dominant issues for them are 
12:244:18331:28:27:90:492:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to be how much access improvement will they experience in service markets 
12:245:18412:27:28:90:495:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:abroad (both in OECD and other developing country markets), and what will be the 
12:246:18493:28:28:90:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impacts for them if there are changes in labour mobility restrictions.  For now studies 
12:247:18581:28:27:90:514:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which address these issues remain informed by poor data, major conceptual difficulties, 
12:248:18669:27:28:90:512:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and in the modelling area are characterized by contradictory results.  On the other hand 
12:249:18758:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the limited econometric studies available point to strong growth effects.  The outcome is 
12:250:18848:27:28:90:503:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that their contribution to policy debate in the area may seem unclear and confusing to 
12:251:18935:28:28:90:501:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outsiders but this often is the state of academic research as it relates to current policy 
12:252:19026:28:27:90:519:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:debates.  The key themes of potentially viewing services trade liberalization as surrogate

13:258:19410:30:28:126:523:644:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Prior to reviewing existing literature relevant to the developing country interest in 
13:259:19496:28:27:90:519:616:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:global services trade liberalization, it may be helpful to first highlight a number of wider 
13:260:19589:27:28:90:305:589:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conceptual issues relevant to the discussion. 
13:261:19635:28:27:126:129:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: 
13:262:19635:27:28:90:479:534:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:2.1 The Developing Country Interest in Trade Liberalization in General 
13:263:19705:28:28:90:523:506:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The presumption behind most discussion of potential developing country interests 
13:264:19786:28:27:90:502:478:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in services trade liberalization is that countries gain from more open services trade in 
13:265:19875:27:28:90:485:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ways which are similar to trade liberalization in goods.  This reflects the idea that 
13:266:19961:28:27:90:496:423:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries have differing comparative advantage in the production of both goods and 
13:267:20044:27:28:90:482:396:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services, and more open trade will allow comparative advantage to be more fully 
13:268:20124:28:28:90:498:368:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exploited in all countries.  Put simply, the thinking is that propositions regarding the 
13:269:20213:28:27:90:501:340:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains from freer trade apply equally to both goods and services.  There are, however, 
13:270:20299:27:28:90:521:313:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many complications with this line of argument even though it is instinctively where most 
13:271:20388:28:27:90:324:285:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:academic economists finish up in their thinking. 
13:272:20437:27:28:90:508:258:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: First, accepting for now the proposition that trade in services and goods can be 
13:273:20518:28:28:90:514:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:treated as analytically similar in this way, the issue of how developing countries benefit 
13:274:20609:28:27:90:524:202:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from services trade liberalization is subject to all of the nuances set out in the literature on 
13:275:20706:27:28:90:486:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade policy.  While most academic economists instinctively believe that there are 
13:276:20789:28:27:90:524:147:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits for all countries from freer trade, over the years they have nevertheless devoted a 
13:277:20882:27:28:90:506:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerable portion of their intellectual energy to producing arguments as to why the 
13:278:20969:28:0:90:493:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contrary may be true.  These include arguments for an optimal tariff (terms of trade 
14:279:21056:0:27:90:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:improvement from protection), for infant industry protection, for tariffs which transfer 
14:280:21145:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rents (rent shifting), and tariffs that offset other domestic distortions.  These arguments 
14:281:21237:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presumably apply equally to trade in services and goods if they are analytically similar, 
14:282:21327:27:28:90:493:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and hence qualify the presumption that freer global trade in service is a good thing. 
14:283:21413:28:28:90:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Second, there are a series of arguments about protection of trade in goods that 
14:284:21493:28:27:90:520:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relate in one way or another primarily to developing countries and these presumably also 
14:285:21582:27:28:90:516:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:come into play in discussing trade in services.  Examples are that increased trade can be 
14:286:21672:28:27:90:498:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:immiserizing due to a terms of trade deterioration; in a Lewis model with traditional 
14:287:21758:27:28:90:515:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:practices in agricultural sectors (average rather than marginal product pricing of labour) 
14:288:21849:28:28:90:494:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:protection of traded goods sectors is called for to pull labour into import competing 
14:289:21935:28:27:90:514:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:modern sectors; in a Harris Todaro model with an urban sector specific downward rigid 
14:290:22021:27:28:90:414:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:real wage and unemployment, an import subsidy can be beneficial. 
14:291:22086:28:27:90:500:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In addition there are many broader issues identified in the literature about the 
14:292:22167:27:28:90:519:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:form global trade liberalization takes and hence its impacts on developing countries, and 
14:293:22257:28:27:90:522:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these would again apply equally to services and goods.  If, as is usually argued, countries 
14:294:22349:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain more from improved access to larger foreign markets (given the larger size of OECD 
14:295:22437:28:28:90:474:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:markets) than from their own liberalization, what they should seek is genuinely 
14:296:22517:28:27:90:506:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:multilateral liberalization rather than only participate in unilateral liberalization.  This 
14:297:22610:27:28:90:511:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:should include freer South-South trade in services, as well as OECD/non OECD trade.  
14:298:22695:28:27:90:523:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Being smaller economically, developing countries have less bargaining power than larger 
14:299:22783:27:28:90:514:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developed countries in trade negotiations, and this applies equally to trade in goods and 
14:300:22873:28:0:90:451:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services and hence globally negotiated outcomes may well be asymmetric. 
15:301:22947:0:27:126:486:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Developing countries also often argue that both trade liberalization and its 
15:302:23024:27:28:90:505:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impacts need to be evaluated in the context of its wider impacts on the developmental 
15:303:23110:28:27:90:519:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:process, including implications for growth and poverty, which are not typically centrally 
15:304:23200:27:28:90:492:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discussed in conventional trade literature.  These arguments also presumably apply 
15:305:23283:28:28:90:277:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equally to trade in goods and services. 
15:306:23323:28:27:126:518:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Hence while the presumption is that global liberalization of trade in services will 
15:307:23407:27:28:90:505:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:yield gains for both developed and poorer developing countries, and hence the central 
15:308:23493:28:27:90:509:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:issue is to evaluate the size of any resulting gains, it needs to be borne in mind that the 
15:309:23585:27:28:90:505:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:arguments even from conventional literature on trade in goods are more nuanced than 
15:310:23669:28:28:90:113:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this. 
15:311:23675:28:27:90:93:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
15:312:23675:27:28:90:416:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:2.2 Differences between trade in services and trade in goods 
15:313:23735:28:27:90:469:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Accepting for now that there is a general presumption that global trade 
15:314:23807:27:28:90:515:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization in either goods and services is broadly beneficial for developing countries 
15:315:23898:28:27:90:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(a contention some would challenge), the next issue is whether goods and services differ 
15:316:23987:27:28:90:498:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in some important way.  Do they need to be approached differently in evaluating the 
15:317:24071:28:28:90:241:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative impacts involved? 
15:318:24102:28:27:90:511:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: This is a key issue in discussing the impacts of services liberalization on poorer 
15:319:24185:27:28:90:516:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries, since much if not most of the existing quantitative literature treats 
15:320:24277:28:27:90:498:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services as analytically similar to goods.  The approach is to define a single product, 
15:321:24365:27:28:90:518:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:commonly called producer services, which is an input into production and against which 
15:322:24452:28:28:90:515:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade protection operates with a tariff like instrument.  Liberalization is then a reduction 
15:323:24545:28:0:90:522:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in or elimination of the tariff.  Not surprisingly numerical results from models are similar 
16:324:24640:0:27:90:518:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to those of trade liberalization in goods.  Small positive gains accrue to most countries if 
16:325:24733:27:28:90:471:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there are no factor mobility effects captured, as in goods liberalization models. 
16:326:24815:28:27:90:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In reality, however, the term services captures a heterogeneous group of activities 
16:327:24899:27:28:90:501:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spanning banking, insurance, transportation, telecoms, consulting services, retail and 
16:328:24986:28:28:90:484:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wholesale trade, and several others.  Much of this activity facilitates transactions, 
16:329:25072:28:27:90:522:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providing the economic function of intermediation either through time or space which, as 
16:330:25161:27:28:90:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pointed out by Melvin (1989), when explicitly modelled as such can produce different 
16:331:25246:28:27:90:266:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implications for trade liberalization. 
16:332:25285:27:28:90:517:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Ryan (1990, 1992), for instance, shows that when banking is explicitly modelled 
16:333:25365:28:28:90:498:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as intermediation services that themselves do not directly provide utility, but instead 
16:334:25453:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:facilitate intermediation between borrowers and lenders, liberalization of trade in banking 
16:335:25545:27:28:90:514:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services can reduce GDP, and even welfare.  Chia and Whalley (1997) have produced a 
16:336:25629:28:27:90:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:numerical example of welfare worsening trade liberalization in banking services based on 
16:337:25718:27:28:90:507:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this approach.  The results from such examples reflect the use of specific formulations 
16:338:25806:28:27:90:510:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and parameter values and functional forms and are hence not general results.  They do, 
16:339:25893:27:28:90:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:however, suggest a weakening in the general presumption that gains will be automatically 
16:340:25982:28:28:90:500:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shared between developed and poorer developing countries if global liberalization of 
16:341:26067:28:27:90:502:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade occurs.  Bhatterai and Whalley (1999) provide a related analysis of the 
16:342:26154:27:28:90:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implications of liberalization in network services (effectively telecoms) where the same 
16:343:26243:28:27:90:518:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:theme emerges that recognition of the special features of individual services changes the 
16:344:26333:27:28:90:327:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analysis of the impacts of services liberalization. 
16:345:26385:28:28:90:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Another difference is that to achieve meaningful trade liberalization in services 
16:346:26467:28:0:90:506:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may require modifications of factor mobility restrictions which may not be needed for 
17:347:26555:0:27:90:506:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:goods liberalization.  This is recognized in Modes 3 and 4 of GATS which effectively 
17:348:26640:27:28:90:522:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relate to capital (FDI) mobility and labour (service provider) mobility.  With restricted or 
17:349:26733:28:27:90:517:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:segmented global factor markets (and especially labour markets), large effects can come 
17:350:26821:27:28:90:500:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from services liberalization if such liberalization becomes an indirect mechanism for 
17:351:26907:28:28:90:491:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalizing global factor markets.  This is a central issue for the poorer developing 
17:352:26994:28:27:90:495:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries who have long pushed for liberalization of immigration controls in OECD 
17:353:27076:27:28:90:510:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries, since global services liberalization may be a vehicle for them to achieve this 
17:354:27166:28:27:90:113:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:end. 
17:355:27171:27:28:90:505:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Thus whether services are treated as being different from goods, whether their 
17:356:27250:28:28:90:521:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economic characteristics are explicitly modelled, and how factor flows are treated can all 
17:357:27341:28:27:90:506:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:make a large difference to the perceived effects of trade liberalization in services (and 
17:358:27431:27:28:90:231:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both to sign and magnitude).

17:360:27460:27:28:90:493:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:2.3 Types of services trade liberalization; deregulation/competition/barrier 
17:361:27536:28:27:126:178:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:A:reduction 
17:362:27545:27:28:90:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: A further key issue in discussing trade/liberalization in services and its impacts on 
17:363:27631:28:28:90:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poorer developing countries is that the types and forms of liberalization need to be fully 
17:364:27722:28:27:90:510:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and carefully specified.  As a result, these often have to be discussed in ways which do 
17:365:27811:27:28:90:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not arise with liberalization in goods trade.  Barriers to the flow of goods typically arise 
17:366:27904:28:27:90:507:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as customs and other physical restraints on trade are administered at national borders.  
17:367:27993:27:28:90:521:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, for goods trade, most discussion of liberalization focuses on tariffs (and less so) on 
17:368:28086:28:0:90:180:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other instruments. 
18:369:28107:0:27:90:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Within the services trade community and in the policy literature in general, there 
18:370:28190:27:28:90:508:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is an understanding that the outcomes of services liberalization will depend heavily on 
18:371:28278:28:27:90:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the regulatory environment and the need for liberalization to be underpinned by a sound 
18:372:28366:27:28:90:518:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regulatory framework.  Restraints on trade no longer apply in the same way as for goods 
18:373:28454:28:28:90:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at borders; a wider variety of restraints than those typically applicable to goods apply 
18:374:28543:28:27:90:513:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:beyond borders and hence within national markets.  Also, since services generally have 
18:375:28630:27:28:90:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:no tangible form and hence cannot be physically restrained at the border, but typically 
18:376:28718:28:27:90:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:foreign service providers need to have to have entry to the national market either for the 
18:377:28809:27:28:90:514:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service itself.  The entity that provides the service, or service providers themselves may 
18:378:28900:28:28:90:496:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be restricted in terms of their mobility, and it is here that restraints on services trade 
18:379:28991:28:27:90:186:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effectively operate. 
18:380:29012:27:28:90:515:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Barriers to service provision may operate through entry barriers to local markets 
18:381:29094:28:27:90:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(rights to establish, or to provide services), rules on conduct (regulation), on the number 
18:382:29186:27:28:90:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and size of competitors in a market (competition rules), and in other ways.  As a result 
18:383:29275:28:27:90:513:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many more barriers come into play with services than with goods trade.  They are more 
18:384:29361:27:28:90:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:complex, and their effects more numerous.  Market structure, conduct, and performance 
18:385:29447:28:28:90:508:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are all key and all need to be evaluated when discussing quantitative impacts of global 
18:386:29535:28:27:90:394:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization of services trade on poorer developing countries.

18:388:29600:28:27:90:491:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:2.4 How different are barriers across developed and developing countries? 
18:389:29673:27:28:90:522:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The actual numbers for barriers to service trade flows used in different studies for 
18:390:29758:28:28:90:521:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers to service trade flows are discussed in more detail below, but it is worth pointing 
18:391:29851:28:0:90:500:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:out at this stage that the general perception is both that services trade is considerably 
19:392:29943:0:27:90:522:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more heavily restricted than goods trade (and in manufactures in particular, rather than in 
19:393:30035:27:28:90:490:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:agriculture where high barriers still apply), and considerably more so in the poorer 
19:394:30120:28:27:90:476:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries than in developed countries.  As noted in the introduction, 
19:395:30201:27:28:90:511:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries in reality are an extremely heterogeneous group of countries with 
19:396:30288:28:28:90:516:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sharply differing characteristics and use of restrictions on service provision, but for now 
19:397:30380:28:27:90:521:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we will use this terminology in discussing barrier differences across broad country types. 
19:398:30471:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The precise extent of market segmentation across countries in services is not well 
19:399:30554:28:27:90:487:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:documented, but is often claimed to be large.  For example, despite claims of ever 
19:400:30637:27:28:90:482:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growing globalization, in most countries around the world branch banking is still 
19:401:30719:28:28:90:515:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provided by local banks, insurance policies are still written by local companies, internal 
19:402:30810:28:27:90:525:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:air transportation is by local carriers, as is road, rail, and maritime.  Retailing continues to 
19:403:30907:27:28:90:383:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be dominated by domestic retailers in most country markets. 
19:404:30967:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Among developed countries, there seems to be evidence of growing cross country 
19:405:31046:27:28:90:469:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service trade.  Some of this reflects cross country foreign direct investment, or 
19:406:31128:28:27:90:504:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:buyouts/mergers of local service providers by foreign entities.  Thus, growing market 
19:407:31214:27:28:90:505:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:integration in the services areas seems to be occurring in these countries, even though 
19:408:31302:28:28:90:520:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:domestic regulations often seem slow to change.  In the developing countries in contrast, 
19:409:31392:28:27:90:513:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less market integration and cross market penetration in services seems to have occurred 
19:410:31480:27:28:90:508:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:although the process would be poised to accelerate more rapidly than in the developed 
19:411:31566:28:27:90:466:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:world.  For now, local service providers remain as locally owned entities, and 
19:412:31645:27:28:90:490:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interdeveloping country service trade is small in part because of barriers to foreign 
19:413:31731:28:28:90:515:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service providers.  Service trade as a share of total trade is also correspondingly smaller 
19:414:31823:28:0:90:297:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in developed than in developing countries. 
20:415:31868:0:27:90:492:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The presumption in any quantification of impacts of global liberalization of 
20:416:31945:27:28:90:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade on poorer developing countries is that barriers to service trade are currently 
20:417:32039:28:27:90:511:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large in both developed and developing countries, and while relaxing a little, probably  
20:418:32128:27:28:90:510:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are more restrictive on average in developing than in developed country markets.  This 
20:419:32215:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presumption underlies arguments from the policy community for large potential effects to 
20:420:32304:28:0:90:449:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:follow from services trade liberalization as it relates to South-South trade. 
21:421:32384:0:32:90:495:706:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f4:C:3. The Representation and Measurement of Barriers to Services 
21:422:32445:32:30:90:165:674:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f3:C:          Trade 
21:423:32460:30:28:107:500:644:195:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: As noted earlier, both characterizing and measuring the size of barriers to the 
21:424:32540:28:27:90:518:616:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:international flow of services is considerably more complex and nuanced than is true for 
21:425:32629:27:28:90:512:589:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers faced by international trade in goods and the problems encountered in this area 
21:426:32718:28:27:90:510:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also affect any discussion of the quantitative impacts of services trade liberalization on 
21:427:32809:27:28:90:196:534:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries. 
21:428:32831:28:28:126:486:506:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Thinking on barriers facing international trade in goods in part reflects the 
21:429:32909:28:27:90:495:478:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:structure of the 1967 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade incorporated into the 
21:430:32992:27:28:90:518:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Charter of the WTO as GATT 1994.  The GATT structure tries to limit barriers to goods 
21:431:33078:28:27:90:459:423:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows to transparent and bound tariffs which can then be negotiated down to 
21:432:33154:27:28:90:222:396:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:progressively lower levels. 
21:433:33182:28:28:126:501:368:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The principle of National Treatment (no discrimination against foreign goods 
21:434:33259:28:27:90:521:340:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:within national economies) in the WTO Charter implies that all barriers apply only at the 
21:435:33349:27:28:90:487:313:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:border as goods enter national markets.  This is typically through a tariff or quota, 
21:436:33435:28:27:90:486:285:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:although quotas are formally banned under Article 11 of GATT 1994 in the WTO 
21:437:33512:27:28:90:487:258:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:charter.  For services the structure under the 1994 GATT is different.  No national 
21:438:33596:28:28:90:516:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:borders apply for services trade since there is no customs clearance.  Barriers to the free 
21:439:33688:28:27:90:516:202:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:international flow of services take many other forms in place of tariffs; regulation, entry 
21:440:33780:27:28:90:525:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers, restrictions on the mobility of service providers.  The structure of the GATS thus 
21:441:33873:28:27:90:515:147:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differs from the GATT; for instance, National Treatment does not stand as an automatic 
21:442:33960:27:28:90:488:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:right and must be bargained for.  This all makes discussion of and classification of 
21:443:34045:28:0:89:520:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers to service flows more difficult than for goods, since trade economists are usually 
22:444:34139:0:27:90:479:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:drawn back to analogies with restrictions on goods flows, and look for tariff like 
22:445:34222:27:28:90:476:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measures of barriers.  Many of analogies can be misleading and even ultimately 
22:446:34301:28:27:90:158:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:uniformative.

22:448:34315:28:28:90:482:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:3.1 Approaches to Classifying and Measuring Barriers to Services Trade 
22:449:34385:28:27:126:497:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There are basically two different approaches used in the literature to classify 
22:450:34465:27:28:90:512:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers to trade in service items for the purposes of both measurement of their size and 
22:451:34555:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wider liberalization discussion.  One is to separately examine the structure of regulation, 
22:452:34647:27:28:90:462:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entry barriers, and mobility restrictions for in each service market.  Different 
22:453:34728:28:28:90:505:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions/regulations apply, say, in banking from, say, road transport because of the 
22:454:34817:28:27:90:518:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differences in the characteristics of the service.  Under this approach, a restriction on the 
22:455:34911:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value of reserves of a foreign bank to be retained within a country is a different restriction 
22:456:35006:28:27:90:509:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to one which requires, say, that trucks at the border must enter with a full tank.  If they 
22:457:35098:27:28:90:483:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are converted into any comparable form in terms of economic impact, this can be 
22:458:35178:28:27:90:499:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attempted by examining their cost implications.  However, some restrictions imply a 
22:459:35262:27:28:90:495:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fixed cost for entering a market, others change marginal costs, others effectively set 
22:460:35349:28:28:90:476:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:upper bounds on the quantity of service provided, or establish minimum quality 
22:461:35428:28:27:90:511:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:standards.  Comparing barriers and evaluating their impacts is thus inherently difficult, 
22:462:35518:27:28:90:524:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and the heterogeneity among broad service types (banking, transportation, for instance) is 
22:463:35609:28:27:90:523:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a further complication, as is the heterogeneity within categories (types of services offered 
22:464:35702:27:28:90:214:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by financial institutions). 
22:465:35730:28:28:126:481:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The other approach is that which has been taken in most of the numerical 
22:466:35803:28:0:90:462:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:modelling literature on trade in services and is to treat all services as a single 
23:467:35888:0:27:90:485:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:homogeneous entity.  Unfortunately, this forced and artificial generality can yield 
23:468:35972:27:28:90:475:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:misleading results if used as the basis for policy debate on global services trade 
23:469:36055:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization and its impacts on developing countries.  In some more recent literature 
23:470:36143:27:28:90:509:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there are partial modifications to the approach, such as attempts to differentiate among 
23:471:36232:28:28:90:505:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the various ways that services can be supplied.  The typical treatment is to model FDI 
23:472:36319:28:27:90:496:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows as linked to services provision (along the lines of GATS Mode 3 (commercial 
23:473:36401:27:28:90:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presence)).  Labour mobility arrangements under GATS Mode 4 (temporary movement 
23:474:36481:28:27:90:492:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of service providers) has also been separately modelled.  But classifying functional 
23:475:36566:27:28:90:503:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers which may be service category specific as part of a general categorization by 
23:476:36653:28:28:90:392:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mode of supply remains as the central feature of the approach.

23:479:36744:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Because of the key role played by negotiation in the WTO in the services area, the 
23:480:36827:27:28:90:517:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approach to services taken in General Agreement of Trade in Services (GATS) becomes 
23:481:36911:28:27:90:495:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relevant to both the discussion of and quantification of the impacts of services trade 
23:482:36998:27:28:90:514:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization.  This is because it provides the broad framework within which the policy 
23:483:37087:28:28:90:495:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:community (as distinct from the research community) discuss trade liberalization in 
23:484:37171:28:27:90:513:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services.  Until relatively recently the different modes of supply for services have made 
23:485:37261:27:28:90:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively little difference to how economic modelers view services, and this has been one 
23:486:37352:28:27:90:479:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the central weaknesses of their work.  Markusen, Rutherford, and Tarr (2000) 
23:487:37432:27:28:90:512:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:represent one recent attempt to deal with Mode 3 restrictions; Winters (2002) discusses 
23:488:37520:28:0:90:415:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the modelling of Mode 4 restrictions.  These are discussed below.   
24:489:37590:0:27:117:503:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The GATS classifies services into 155 service types, and differentiates between 
24:490:37670:27:28:90:476:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:four modes of supply.  The modes provide a devise to facilitating the making of 
24:491:37750:28:27:90:321:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:commitments in negotiation.  These modes are: 
24:492:37796:27:28:90:495:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mode 1: Cross border supply.  This is where a service is supplied directly to a 
24:493:37876:28:28:161:507:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:consumer’s country of residence from a supplier’s country of residence 
24:494:37947:28:27:161:447:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:(eg. legal advice from abroad given by letter or telephone). 
24:495:38008:27:28:89:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mode 2:           Consumption           abroad.  This is where a service is supplied to a consumer 
24:496:38107:28:27:162:514:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:by the consumer physically moving to the suppliers country of residence 
24:497:38179:27:28:162:435:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:to receive the service (eg, a visit to a law office abroad). 
24:498:38240:28:28:90:519:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mode 3:           Commercial           presence.  This is where supply of a service by a commercial 
24:499:38340:28:27:161:517:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:organization involves moving to a consumer’s country of residence (FDI, 
24:500:38412:27:28:161:227:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:for instance). 
24:501:38427:28:27:89:507:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mode 4: Presence of Natural Persons.  This is where a service is supplied by the 
24:502:38508:27:28:162:516:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:(typically temporary) movement of a services provider to the consumer’s 
24:503:38580:28:27:162:480:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:country of residence (eg. labour mobility of the service provider). 
24:504:38648:27:28:90:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Thus under this approach barriers to trade in services are effectively categorized 
24:505:38731:28:28:90:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both by the type of service to which they apply and by mode of supply.  The idea is that 
24:506:38820:28:27:90:522:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in negotiation countries will schedule commitments on barriers to service trade using this 
24:507:38911:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:categorization.  Thus, by way of example, a country which commits to always allow five 
24:508:38998:28:27:90:491:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:star hotels to operate within their territory schedules a commitment under a type of 
24:509:39083:27:28:90:491:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service (tourism) and a mode of supply (commercial presence).  The aim is to have 
24:510:39165:28:28:90:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:negotiations occur through which countries can jointly agree to schedule commitments 
24:511:39250:28:0:90:512:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:under the structure of the GATS.  This involves a different procedure from the bilateral 
25:512:39341:0:27:90:494:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exchange of concessions on goods trade (extended via MFN) as practised in the old 
25:513:39423:27:28:90:128:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:GATT. 
25:514:39429:28:27:90:514:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: For the purposes of the discussion here, the key point is that while the GATS, in 
25:515:39511:27:28:90:467:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect, provides a vehicle for classifying and cataloging restrictions to the free 
25:516:39594:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:international flow of services; it does not provide an analytical framework for evaluation 
25:517:39685:28:27:90:405:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of their impacts.  It is description and classification, not analysis.

25:520:39832:27:28:126:172:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:A:Barriers 
25:521:39840:28:28:90:497:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: To evaluate the impacts of service trade restrictions on developing (or other) 
25:522:39919:28:27:90:514:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries, some method of grouping restrictions on service trade captured by the GATS 
25:523:40005:27:28:90:506:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classification scheme must be used which allows their impacts to be assessed within a 
25:524:40091:28:27:90:510:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:meaningful analytical structure.  One way to proceed is to assume that all service trade 
25:525:40180:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions have effects equivalent to those of a tariff as they apply to the flow of services 
25:526:40276:28:27:90:497:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across borders even though no customs clearance applies and tariffs do not formally 
25:527:40360:27:28:90:490:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:apply to services.  This is the treatment adopted in most quantitative literature (see 
25:528:40447:28:28:90:474:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:below) which uses advalorem equivalent treatment of barriers to services trade. 
25:529:40527:28:27:90:524:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In analytical literature, however, barriers to free international flows of services are 
25:530:40615:27:28:90:473:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerably more multifaceted than this, and so alternative formalizations and 
25:531:40695:28:27:90:510:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conceptualizations of the barriers at issue are involved.  Many are regulatory in nature, 
25:532:40785:27:28:90:505:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and perhaps fit more comfortably within the large literature on industrial organization 
25:533:40873:28:0:90:330:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more so than within conventional trade literature. 
26:534:40926:0:27:90:515:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Thus, by way of example, there may be barriers to entry to domestic markets for 
26:535:41006:27:28:90:511:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:foreign service providers.  These barriers may be classified under mode 3 of GATS but 
26:536:41092:28:27:90:488:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may include not only rights to establish, but also sector specific rules on entry and 
26:537:41178:27:28:90:508:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conduct.  Examples would be the scheduling of domestic banks in banking legislation; 
26:538:41263:28:28:90:511:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:domestic asset rules for insurance policy writers and other such arrangements.  Each of 
26:539:41351:28:27:90:459:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these rule regimes is typically sector specific and operates in different ways. 
26:540:41431:27:28:90:495:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: There may also be regulations which relate to performance requirements for 
26:541:41506:28:27:90:522:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants in domestic markets.  These may not necessarily discriminate against foreign 
26:542:41596:27:28:90:479:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms, but if domestic practices differ from those used abroad and there are scale 
26:543:41679:28:28:90:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economies the effect can again be to retard trade.  Further barriers may arise with limits 
26:544:41770:28:27:90:511:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the mobility of service providers (both forms and persons), perhaps requiring use of 
26:545:41858:27:28:90:493:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:local rather than foreign forms and or local labour in service provision.  Ownership 
26:546:41943:28:27:90:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers, such as in airlines and (in some cases) telecoms and insurance are one example 
26:547:42032:27:28:90:497:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of such barriers.  Immigration and visa arrangements yielding GATS mode 4 supply 
26:548:42113:28:27:90:509:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions are another.  The latter play a large and central role as far as the impacts of 
26:549:42206:27:28:90:427:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service trade flow restrictions on developing countries are concerned. 
26:550:42277:28:28:90:516:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Analytically, all these different barrier treatments will yield different predictions 
26:551:42363:28:27:90:505:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as to the effects on trade in service flows relative to modelling which uses ad valorem 
26:552:42451:27:28:90:521:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent tariff forms.  Relatively little is known numerically as to the differences in the 
26:553:42545:28:27:90:483:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:orders of magnitude involved, and/or the signs of the effects from explicit barrier 
26:554:42629:27:28:90:488:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:representation compared to ad valorem treatment.  In the goods area (especially in 
26:555:42712:28:28:90:519:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:agriculture) it is thought the differences between advalorem equivalent form and explicit 
26:556:42802:28:0:90:229:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:representation can be major.

27:559:42930:28:27:89:488:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: As noted above, the approach followed in most of the numerical modelling 
27:560:43003:27:28:89:500:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature on services is to treat barriers to services trade in advalorem form, as either 
27:561:43094:28:28:89:484:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tariff or non tariff equivalent instruments.  A widely used approach to gauge their 
27:562:43178:28:27:89:504:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative impact is to construct frequency measures showing the extent of usage of 
27:563:43264:27:28:89:502:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service trade restrictions, from which the severity of the impacts of such measures on 
27:564:43351:28:27:89:510:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade flows are loosely inferred.  To be fair to this work, no major claims are made that 
27:565:43441:27:28:89:506:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these measures tell one very much about the true quantitative impact of restrictions on 
27:566:43529:28:28:89:489:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade flows.  They appear to be both constructed and used as few alternatives seem 
27:567:43612:28:27:89:469:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:available and there is an understandable demand for some form of quantitative 
27:568:43690:27:28:89:148:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assessment. 
27:569:43702:28:27:125:510:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The key paper here, is by Hoekman (1995) who uses the GATS commitment of 
27:570:43775:27:28:89:491:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schedules of member countries to make a series of calculations.  He utilizes all 155 
27:571:43860:28:27:89:520:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service categories in GATS and the four modes of supply for each importing country and 
27:572:43947:27:28:89:519:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gives values of 1, 0.5, or 0 to each category/mode possibility for each country depending 
27:573:44037:28:28:89:523:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:upon frequency of use of measures.  If no restrictions apply for a given mode of supply in 
27:574:44128:28:27:89:518:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a given sector a value of 0 is assigned.  If restrictions operate for a given mode of supply 
27:575:44221:27:28:90:509:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in a given sector a value of 0.5 is assigned.  These scores are labeled openness/binding 
27:576:44310:28:27:90:524:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factors.  He then aggregates the resulting assigned values across modes and across service 
27:577:44401:27:60:90:151:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:categories.

27:579:44463:7:16:90:507:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2 This section draws on the discussion of the literature attempting to use these various approaches these 
27:580:44569:16:0:89:241:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:measures set out in Copeland (2002). 
28:581:44608:0:27:90:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Hoekman uses these assigned scores to calculate three ratios for each sector.  The 
28:582:44691:27:28:90:492:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first sums indices and divides them by 620 (155 × 4) for each country.  The second 
28:583:44774:28:27:90:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:calculates the sectors/modes listed with restrictions as a share of the maximum possible, 
28:584:44864:27:28:90:522:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:weighted by the openness/binding factors.  The third calculates the share of no restriction 
28:585:44956:28:28:90:519:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entries in either a member country’s total commitments or relative to the universe of 155 
28:586:45046:28:27:90:172:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible sectors. 
28:587:45064:27:28:90:501:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: A number of subsequent authors (particularly those associated with extensive 
28:588:45141:28:27:90:482:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work undertaken by the Australian Productivity Commission) have extended this 
28:589:45219:27:28:90:512:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approach and constructed more elaborate frequency measures which they label as trade 
28:590:45304:28:28:90:515:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictiveness indices.  The basic approach, however, remains the same and most of the 
28:591:45392:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:difficulties of interpretation which the Hoekman frequency measures encounter remain.  
28:592:45479:27:28:90:493:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Since Hoekman’s paper these measures have been calculated in a series of industry 
28:593:45561:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies; for telecoms by Warren (2001a and 2001b); for banking by McGuire and Schnele 
28:594:45647:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(2001a); for maritime transport by McGuire et al (2001b); for education by Kemp (2001); 
28:595:45735:28:27:90:490:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for distribution by Kalirajan (2000) and for professional services by Nguyen-Hong 
28:596:45817:27:28:90:522:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(2000).  Hardin and Holmes (1997) also use frequency indices to evaluate barriers to FDI 
28:597:45906:28:28:90:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across service industries.  The edited volume by Findlay and Warren (2001) contains an 
28:598:45993:28:27:90:365:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accessible and helpful compilation of some of this work. 
28:599:46050:27:28:90:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In calculating these extended frequency indices, information on actual restrictions 
28:600:46134:28:27:90:517:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on trade and investment in specific service industries is typically drawn on from a wider 
28:601:46224:27:28:90:507:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:range of sources than just the GATS schedules.  Restrictions receive subjective scores 
28:602:46311:28:28:90:494:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and are then grouped into categories, and each given a numerical weighting.  These 
28:603:46394:28:0:90:512:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:typically reflect some form of subjective assessment of the costs of these restrictions in 
29:604:46487:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:terms of economic inefficiency.  Several indices are typically calculated for each industry 
29:605:46579:27:28:90:372:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to yield measures for different notions of barriers to trade. 
29:606:46641:28:27:90:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: As an alternative to the frequency index approach to measuring barriers, price 
29:607:46720:27:28:90:481:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:based measures of barriers to service trade have been proposed, but thus far little 
29:608:46804:28:28:90:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:calculated.  Ideally they should reflect differences between domestic and foreign prices 
29:609:46893:28:27:90:516:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for key service categories across supplying and using countries.  Francois and Hoekman 
29:610:46980:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(1999) propose (but do not construct) a measure based on gross operating margins.  They 
29:611:47068:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggest these should be measured in ratio form as (total sales revenue minus total average 
29:612:47159:27:28:90:504:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs)/total average costs.  Alternatively, price based measures have been constructed 
29:613:47246:28:28:90:510:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:using econometric methods to construct cross country cost measures by Trewin (2001) 
29:614:47330:28:27:90:500:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for telecoms, Kalirajan et al (2001) for banking, Kang (2001) for maritime transport, 
29:615:47416:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Kalirajan (2000) for food distribution, and Nguyen-Hong (2000) for engineering services. 
29:616:47505:28:27:90:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Quantity based measures of the severity of service trade restrictions are typically 
29:617:47589:27:28:90:492:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:based on results of econometric models.  The idea is that these should in some way 
29:618:47672:28:27:90:512:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reflect the determinants of service trade and hence be able to predict what service trade 
29:619:47762:27:28:90:520:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows would be if there were no restrictions in place.  This work typically extends earlier 
29:620:47854:28:28:90:506:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work of this type used for goods trade to measure barriers to goods flows by residual.  
29:621:47942:28:27:90:521:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Francois and Hoekman (1999), for instance, fit a gravity model to bilateral trade flows in 
29:622:48033:27:28:90:481:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services between the United States and its trading partners.  Differences between 
29:623:48115:28:27:90:520:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predicted and actual trade are then taken to imply the effects of barriers to trade.  Warren 
29:624:48208:27:28:90:521:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(2001) uses an alternative econometric procedure to develop quantity based measures for 
29:625:48296:28:28:90:347:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers facing trade in telecommunications services.

30:628:48409:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: These measures of barriers to service trade flows, while clearly defensible on the 
30:629:48492:28:27:90:488:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grounds that this is all there is, nonetheless encounters numerous pitfalls and must 
30:630:48577:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:therefore be used with great care.  This makes any quantitative discussion of impacts of 
30:631:48666:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade liberalization on developing countries using them difficult to interpret with 
30:632:48759:28:27:90:149:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:confidence. 
30:633:48771:27:28:90:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: First there is the issue that with multiple restraints on trade it is not clear which 
30:634:48857:28:27:90:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions are binding and which are not.  While frequency data only evaluate whether 
30:635:48945:27:28:90:519:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions apply for each of 620 GATS cells for a given service type and across all four 
30:636:49036:28:28:90:486:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:modes of supply, it is not clear that all aggregated restrictions are, in fact, binding 
30:637:49124:28:27:90:509:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restraints on trade.  Some may restrict trade, some may not.  Some may compound one 
30:638:49208:27:28:90:509:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with another, others may offset each other.  In the literature on economic distortions in 
30:639:49298:28:27:90:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:general, such as tax policy, the extent to which curious legal instruments of intervention 
30:640:49389:27:28:90:517:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in practice compound or offset is a major theme of literature.  None of this appears to be 
30:641:49480:28:27:90:343:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:present in the literature on service trade restrictions. 
30:642:49537:27:28:90:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Second, just because restrictions are present their quantitative significance need 
30:643:49620:28:28:90:518:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not be the same across restrictions.  Their marginal effects on trade will typically differ.  
30:644:49714:28:27:90:489:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:And yet in frequency measures they are aggregated as if they are all in some sense 
30:645:49797:27:28:90:504:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equiproportional in impact.  There seems no logical reason why this need be the case. 
30:646:49883:28:27:90:471:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Other problems can also arise.  Frequency measures may mask country 
30:647:49951:27:28:90:489:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discrimination in the application of barriers, even though both de jure and de facto 
30:648:50036:28:28:90:523:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discrimination are considered breaches of national treatment under the GATS.  Offsetting 
30:649:50125:28:0:90:512:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy type and restrictive measures may apply and these offsets will need to be taken 
31:650:50215:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:into account.  Defacto application of regulation and dejure form can differ, just as applied 
31:651:50308:27:28:90:317:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and bound tariff rates differ for trade in goods. 
31:652:50358:28:27:90:521:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: As far as quantity based measures are concerned, measures are typically based on

31:654:50517:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predictions.  Not only is there much debate as to which is the most appropriate model for 
31:655:50607:28:27:90:521:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such purposes, barrier estimates obtained in this way can be negative even when no trade 
31:656:50696:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restricting interventions apply.  Also, quantity based measures can be positive even when 
31:657:50786:28:27:90:222:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:frequency indices are zero. 
31:658:50814:27:28:90:521:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Price based measures also have problems of interpretation.  Not only is price data 
31:659:50897:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on service types extremely hard to obtain, at a conceptual level differences in domestic 
31:660:50986:28:27:90:505:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regulation can imply differences in costs of service provision in different markets and 
31:661:51074:27:28:90:520:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hence prices across countries even if there are no formal barriers.  Thus price differences 
31:662:51166:28:27:90:482:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across countries for services need not be related to barriers, even if they could be 
31:663:51251:27:28:90:512:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measured.  Moreover, the price changes generated by a barrier depends on demand and 
31:664:51335:28:27:90:498:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:supply elasticities, and without elasticity estimates (which are not available) it is not 
31:665:51425:27:28:90:495:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible to move easily between observed price differences and ad valorem barriers 
31:666:51508:28:28:90:328:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which models implicitly assume generated them. 
31:667:51555:28:27:90:523:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Thus interpreting barrier measures for services trade faces many pitfalls.  One can 
31:668:51639:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:argue this is true in general for most observations of economic phenomena interpreted in 
31:669:51728:28:27:90:492:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some analytical model equivalent form, but at the end of the day the problems with 
31:670:51811:27:28:90:524:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barrier estimates for service trade seem especially severe.  They seem to be used solely as 
31:671:51903:28:28:90:503:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the best alternative given the policy prerogative of providing some form of numerical

32:674:52172:27:28:90:235:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only be described as wanting.

33:679:52386:28:27:90:501:616:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attempt to quantify the impacts which would follow if global liberalization involving 
33:680:52472:27:28:90:514:589:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lowering them were to occur.  Some of the results from these models explicitly relate to 
33:681:52561:28:27:90:508:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poorer developing countries.  These quantitative studies in the main involve the use of 
33:682:52649:27:28:90:525:534:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:numerical general equilibrium models.  They are used to make counterfactual equilibrium 
33:683:52737:28:28:90:518:506:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:calculations in which barriers to service trade flows are allowed to change and base case 
33:684:52827:28:27:90:519:478:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data and simulated equilibria compared.  This involves calibration to a base case data set 
33:685:52918:27:28:90:512:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and the use of various loosely specified and quasi literature based elasticities which are

33:691:53271:28:27:90:513:285:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: There are a range of model treatments used in the these models.  Key papers are 
33:692:53351:27:28:90:506:258:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Robinson, Wang, and Martin (1999), Dee and Hanslow (2000), and Brown, Deardorff 
33:693:53431:28:28:90:511:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Stern (2002).  Typically, services are treated in these models very much like goods 
33:694:53519:28:27:90:505:202:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with producer services modeled as an intermediate good, and some models also allow 
33:695:53602:27:28:90:476:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade to be generated by differences in factor endowments as well as by product 
33:696:53682:28:27:90:522:147:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differentiation as in more recent goods trade models.  As in the modelling of goods trade, 
33:697:53773:27:28:90:508:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some models (such as Markusen, Rutherford, and Tarr (1999)) allow for multinational 
33:698:53857:28:0:90:511:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:activity and endogenous choice by multinational forms of whether to export or set up a 
34:699:53946:0:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:branch plant.  Models typically do not explicitly represent the different modes of supply 
34:700:54036:27:28:90:513:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the GATS, although FDI flows (close to mode 3) and labour mobility restrictions are 
34:701:54123:28:27:90:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:captured in more recent models.  Winters (2002), and Winters, Walmsley, Wang, and

34:703:54293:28:28:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows.  It is not a feature of these models that they employ explicit characterizations of 
34:704:54384:28:27:90:479:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individual service elements (banking, insurance, etc.) and these are typically not 
34:705:54467:27:28:90:197:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explicitly recognized.

34:708:54520:28:28:90:506:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The results from these models typically show that multilateral liberalization of 
34:709:54601:28:27:90:488:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade will increase global income and welfare, but they also show that the 
34:710:54685:27:28:90:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of the resulting gains is sensitive to the model specification used.  This point 
34:711:54779:28:27:90:499:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is important in understanding what the model implications of global liberalization in 
34:712:54865:27:28:90:273:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services are for developing countries. 
34:713:54904:28:27:90:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Overall, there tend to be global gains from liberalization of service flows and they 
34:714:54989:27:28:90:521:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tend to accrue to all countries, but the effects are sometimes relatively small.  Reductions 
34:715:55082:28:28:90:524:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in barriers are typically much larger than occurs for goods, but the magnitudes of gain are 
34:716:55174:28:27:90:515:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of a similar order to those obtained from earlier simulations of the effects of freer goods 
34:717:55266:27:28:90:518:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade.  By way of example, Dee and Hanslow report results which they suggest show the 
34:718:55352:28:27:90:512:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:world would be better off by $260 billion if all post Uruguay Round barriers to trade in 
34:719:55441:27:28:90:499:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both goods (manufactures and agriculture) and services were eliminated.  About $50 
34:720:55524:28:28:90:469:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion of gains comes from agricultural liberalization, $80 billion comes from 
34:721:55604:28:0:90:523:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:manufactures liberalization, and around $130 billion form services liberalization.  Simply 
35:722:55697:0:27:90:520:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:put global gains from remaining goods liberalization (including agriculture) and services 
35:723:55787:27:28:90:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization are of a similar magnitude.  The $260 billion global gain compares to initial 
35:724:55880:28:27:90:514:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:GATT estimates of $500 billion/year form Uruguay Round liberalization (see Francois, 
35:725:55965:27:28:90:506:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:McDonald, and Nordstrom (1994)), and later ranges of $90-$300 billion (see Whalley 
35:726:56048:28:28:90:493:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(2000)).  The Uruguay Round estimates had no meaningful estimates of gains from 
35:727:56128:28:27:90:228:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade liberalization. 
35:728:56159:27:28:126:518:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A possible explanation of the seeming paradox of equal size effects across goods 
35:729:56240:28:27:90:488:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and services in Dee and Hanslow’s results is that larger barriers apply to a smaller 
35:730:56325:27:28:90:507:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of trade in the service area, and so gains relative to GDP are similar for goods 
35:731:56415:28:28:90:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and services (accepting the analytical structure and parameter values used).  An important 
35:732:56506:28:27:90:501:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristic of this set model results is that where as in Brown et al (1996), Chadha 
35:733:56594:27:28:90:475:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(2000), and Benjamin and Diao (2000) there is no endogeneity in foreign direct 
35:734:56673:28:27:90:505:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment, gains tend to be positive throughout the world.3  Where, however, studies 
35:735:56759:27:28:90:511:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explicitly incorporate foreign direct investment flows results are considerably different 
35:736:56849:28:27:90:487:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(as in Markusen et al (2000)), suggesting that liberalization involving commercial 
35:737:56932:27:28:90:472:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presence (mode 3 in GATS) could well be an important factor in services trade 
35:738:57010:28:28:90:160:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization.

35:740:57109:27:28:90:504:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:but instead focus on output and trade effects.  They show small output effects in most 
35:741:57196:28:27:90:514:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regions (I 2%) with perhaps surprisingly negatives in service industries and positives in 
35:742:57286:27:28:90:520:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturing and agriculture.  The largest positive effect is a +8.3% output increase for 
35:743:57377:28:32:90:517:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:trade and transportation in the Asian NICS; the largest negative is a 3.37% fall in output

35:745:57516:7:16:90:516:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:3 Copeland (2002) emphasizes this point, and the related point below concerning results from models that

36:747:57646:0:27:90:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of public housing in ASEAN.  They do, however, show very large export effects (over 
36:748:57730:27:28:90:510:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:50% increases in trade, transport, private and public services) in most countries.  Their 
36:749:57820:28:27:90:437:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model also captures induced effects on total factor productivity growth.

36:752:58056:28:27:90:474:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Doha Round.  They show a small welfare loss from liberalization in agriculture 
36:753:58135:27:28:90:496:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(seemingly due to the elimination of export subsidies), global welfare gains of $103 
36:754:58220:28:27:90:506:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion from reductions in manufactures tariffs, and a much larger gain of $413 billion 
36:755:58308:27:28:90:509:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from services liberalization.  The largest absolute gains go to the developed countries.

36:761:58673:28:27:90:500:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the many pitfalls that can.  They show that of the additional US $130 billion of gains 
36:762:58760:27:28:90:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:arising from services trade liberalization, about $100 billion would accrue in China alone.  
36:763:58853:28:28:90:505:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Global services trade liberalization in their model results seemingly imply that effects 
36:764:58942:28:27:90:512:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:involving access for foreigners to the Chinese market will dominate all other aspects of 
36:765:59031:27:28:90:228:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services trade liberalization. 
36:766:59062:28:27:126:520:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Dee and Hanslow seemingly offer no explanation for this result in their text other 
36:767:59145:27:28:90:521:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than to say large barriers are involved in the Chinese case.  The barriers are indeed large; 
36:768:59238:28:28:90:500:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a little over 250% as tax equivalent barriers to foreign affiliate capital in the Chinese 
36:769:59328:28:0:90:513:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market.  These seemingly come from a strong assumption that barriers to all services in 
37:770:59418:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:China can be represented as tax equivalents (mark ups of price over cost) for banking and 
37:771:59508:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:telecommunications.  They use a Kalirajan et al (2001) study which measures the effects 
37:772:59596:28:27:90:517:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of trade restrictions on the net interest margins of banks, a direct measure of banks mark 
37:773:59687:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:up of price over cost.  They also use Warren’s measures of the effects of trade restrictions 
37:774:59780:28:28:90:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the quantities of telecommunications services delivered, converting these to a price 
37:775:59868:28:27:90:515:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impacts using estimates of price elasticities of demand for telecommunication services.  
37:776:59957:27:28:90:478:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Dee and Hanslow’s results seemingly follow directly from the very large barrier 
37:777:60037:28:27:90:189:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates for China. 
37:778:60058:27:28:126:446:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Not only is it highly questionable whether barriers in banking and 
37:779:60125:28:28:90:520:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:telecommunications reflect barriers generally to service providers in the Chinese market, 
37:780:60215:28:27:90:500:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one can also query whether these barrier measures really make sense.  In China, four 
37:781:60300:27:28:90:521:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large state owned banks provide most of the financing to the large state owned enterprise 
37:782:60390:28:27:90:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sector and suffer from major non performing loans and make losses.  Rate spreads at the 
37:783:60478:27:28:90:494:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:margin are high, but foreign entrants to the market lending under similar conditions 
37:784:60563:28:27:90:515:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would also require large spreads.  Smaller private banks lending only to the commercial 
37:785:60651:27:28:90:510:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sector have much smaller spreads.  At the margin, a 250% barrier may make no sense.  
37:786:60736:28:28:90:516:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Also, in telecommunications converting quantity impacts to barrier estimates using only 
37:787:60824:28:27:90:495:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:demand elasticities (for which estimates are anyway unreliable) and not also supply 
37:788:60908:27:28:90:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities is hard to interpret.  Everything in the results seemingly follows from barrier 
37:789:61001:28:27:90:515:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates, but one is unsure one can believe them.  And sellers do not comment on their 
37:790:61089:27:28:90:292:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reliability when discussing model results. 
37:791:61132:28:28:126:506:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Dee and Hanslow (2000) also find that while service trade liberalization raises 
37:792:61212:28:0:90:525:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:overall world income the US and other developed countries can experience welfare losses 
38:793:61302:0:27:90:484:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with no explanation provided for this feature of model results.  In contrast certain 
38:794:61387:27:28:90:506:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries, and particularly China as noted above, experience large welfare 
38:795:61473:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains (14% of GDP for China) largely due to the large asymmetry in initial barrier sizes 
38:796:61562:27:28:90:356:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in services across developed and developing countries. 
38:797:61617:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Brown, Deardorff and Stern explicitly modify their earlier analyses to incorporate 
38:798:61700:28:27:90:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:foreign direct investment flows, and also obtain considerably larger welfare effects from 
38:799:61790:27:28:90:502:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services liberalization, showing that the world as a whole gains while some countries 
38:800:61876:28:27:90:503:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lose.  Economies such as Japan and Hong Kong show large gains; the US loses under 
38:801:61958:27:28:90:518:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some specifications gains under others; Canada loses.  The larger size of service barriers 
38:802:62049:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:then goods barriers and their relative size assumed countries seems to be key.  They do 
38:803:62137:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not seem to report the barrier estimates they use in their text, and neither do Robinson et 
38:804:62229:27:28:90:105:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:al.

38:807:62263:28:27:90:509:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Discounting the issue of the reliability of the barrier estimates, these modelling 
38:808:62346:27:28:90:493:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:results can be taken as suggesting that a removal of service trade restrictions which 
38:809:62432:28:28:90:493:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implies barriers towards foreign investment flows whose removal attracts capital to 
38:810:62516:28:27:90:509:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries that had earlier had large barriers towards inward investment flows can yield 
38:811:62604:27:28:90:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significant gains, as in China.  Barriers to entry for service providers in these markets can 
38:812:62698:28:27:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also in some cases generate rents part of which accrue to foreign investors; liberalization 
38:813:62790:27:28:90:524:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of services trade can erode these.  While there are also terms of trade effects generated by 
38:814:62883:28:28:90:489:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:induced FDI flows, as discussed in Brown et al (1996), these also arise in non FDI 
38:815:62966:28:0:90:523:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:models.  Hence the added feature of factor flow liberalization which mode 3 and 4 GATS 
39:816:63055:0:27:90:522:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization facilitates seem to be key to model results.  If developing countries are able 
39:817:63149:27:28:90:463:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to use service trade liberalization to attract inward capital flows this suggests 
39:818:63231:28:27:90:514:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerable gains to them.  At the same time unilateral changes in investment regimes, 
39:819:63319:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:independently of changes in trade barriers in services might achieve much the same result 
39:820:63409:28:28:90:480:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(such as relaxation of equity limits on foreign participation in key sectors).  This 
39:821:63494:28:27:90:519:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differentiation between services trade liberalization and unilateral changes in investment 
39:822:63585:27:28:90:521:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barriers may seem somewhat confusing given that most FDI is in the services sector; and 
39:823:63673:28:27:90:498:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that restrictions on FDI (eg screening, equity limits) need to be scheduled as mode 3 
39:824:63759:27:28:90:515:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions in the relevant GATS sector.  But mode 3 GATS liberalization in services is 
39:825:63848:28:28:90:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:all about changing the conditions for foreign capital to enter the relevant domestic sector.

39:828:63973:28:27:90:515:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: This also raises the issue of what might happen were significant liberalization of 
39:829:64056:27:28:90:520:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services under mode 4 supply to allow significant movement of service providers.  Some 
39:830:64143:28:27:90:517:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:years ago, Hamilton and Whalley (1984) produced a calculation of the potential impacts 
39:831:64230:27:28:90:520:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the global economy from the elimination of all restrictions on labour mobility.  While 
39:832:64320:28:28:90:498:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:clearly extreme as a liberalization scenario, they showed that under some conditions 
39:833:64405:28:27:90:492:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:worldwide income could more than double and there would be major distributional 
39:834:64485:27:28:90:462:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impacts across countries.  Thus, explicitly modelling mode 4 supply services 
39:835:64562:28:27:90:449:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization would seem to be the potential source of even larger effects. 
39:836:64639:27:28:90:502:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: This work on mode 4 is not without its difficulties, in particular because most 
39:837:64719:28:28:90:489:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries require foreign workers to be paid at the same rates as nationals (thereby 
39:838:64804:28:0:90:521:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undermining the cost advantage of DC suppliers).  This is a limitation on the quantitative 
40:839:64897:0:27:90:418:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies showing gains from greater labour mobility.  Labour market 
40:840:64964:27:28:90:475:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions/regulations are equally important (regulation of pay and conditions, 
40:841:65046:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recognition of qualifications, etc.).  Further mode 4 only covers temporary movement – 
40:842:65133:27:28:90:489:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permanent migration is explicitly excluded.  GATS technical definitions aside, the 
40:843:65216:28:28:90:482:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economic impact and policy questions are different for temporary and permanent 
40:844:65295:28:27:90:143:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:migration. 
40:845:65306:27:28:90:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Winters (2001) provides a later calculation which modifies the Hamilton-Whalley 
40:846:65386:28:27:90:502:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assumption of homogeneous labour across countries, by assuming that when workers 
40:847:65467:27:28:90:515:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:move from low to high income countries only one quarter of the productivity difference 
40:848:65554:28:28:90:502:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is returned as a higher wage.  Under this modified assumption gains fall to only $300 
40:849:65640:28:27:90:503:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion/year, but still more than the gains from global liberalization of both goods and 
40:850:65729:27:28:90:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factors reported by Dee and Hanslow (2000).  Similar sensitivity analyses in which global 
40:851:65819:28:27:90:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains from elimination of migration restrictions are reduced when efficiency differences 
40:852:65908:27:28:89:489:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in labour are assumed across countries were also reported in the original Hamilton-

40:854:66006:27:28:89:503:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Winters et al (2002) also indicate that large potential gains would follow from 
40:855:66086:28:28:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only a small increase in the movement of people between low and high income countries.  
40:856:66174:28:27:89:473:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:They suggest that increasing developed country quotas for incoming temporary 
40:857:66251:27:28:89:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:movement of natural persons (TMNP) by 3% of the existing labour will generate global 
40:858:66336:28:27:89:521:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income gains of $150 billion/year, emphasizing the large benefits that would follow from 
40:859:66425:27:28:89:505:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:even modest liberalization of mode 4 GATS restrictions of service provider mobility.  
40:860:66511:28:28:89:488:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Winters (2002) further discusses the economic implications of liberalizing mode 4 
40:861:66593:28:0:89:149:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restrictions. 
41:862:66609:0:27:90:518:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: At present lower developing country labour costs show up more in services trade 
41:863:66689:27:28:90:522:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:via mode 1 than mode 4, given that many countries require equal pay for mode 4 entrants 
41:864:66777:28:27:90:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compared to nationals.  In some sectors, in particular professional and computer services, 
41:865:66868:27:28:90:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:out-sourcing has been driven by the lower wages of professionals in DCs.  Out-sourcing

41:867:67043:28:27:90:518:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service supply via mode 1 and not mode 4 and hence even without mode 4 liberalization 
41:868:67129:27:28:90:511:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significant gains can occur.  Out-sourcing effective poorly captured in existing studies.

41:870:67219:27:28:90:178:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:4.6       Overview 
41:871:67237:28:28:89:505:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: So an overview of model themes might be that while all these studies focus on 
41:872:67315:28:27:89:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:multilateral liberalization of global trade in services rather than unilateral liberalization as 
41:873:67412:27:28:89:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discussed earlier, they all seem to point in the same direction in terms of general effects.  
41:874:67506:28:27:89:503:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:More precise effects by country differ considerably.  They suggest that if services are 
41:875:67594:27:28:89:522:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalized with no accompanying liberalization of factor markets, as in goods trade gains 
41:876:67685:28:27:89:498:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are small.  If, however, services liberalization becomes a mechanism through which  
41:877:67769:27:28:89:511:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:impediments to factor flows (FDI) are removed, then gains are large and uneven across 
41:878:67855:28:28:89:499:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries.  Importantly, it seems that the large effects in these model results need not 
41:879:67944:28:27:89:505:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:come from liberalization of service trade, per se, but from the assumed accompanying 
41:880:68029:27:28:89:470:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization of factor markets.  This is parallel to work on goods trade, where 
41:881:68111:28:27:89:510:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accompanying liberalization of factor markets internationally also produces sometimes 
41:882:68197:27:28:89:292:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large and uneven effects across countries. 
41:883:68240:28:28:89:500:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Thus a major role for service trade liberalization may be to serve as surrogate 
41:884:68320:28:0:89:522:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:global factor market liberalization by allowing for freer factor flows under modes 3 and 4 
42:885:68413:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of GATS schedules.  While such liberalization may be hard to achieve directly, achieving 
42:886:68502:27:28:90:503:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it indirectly under the name of service trade liberalization may be the source of major 
42:887:68590:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain and also country impact.  It may also be the major issue at stake for the developing 
42:888:68680:27:28:90:515:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries in services negotiations in the WTO.  Attracting more capital, and achieving a 
42:889:68769:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:labour outflow so as to reapportion factor ratios across broad blocs of countries, might be 
42:890:68861:28:27:90:518:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the source of largest global gain and distributional impact across countries from services

43:903:69498:27:28:126:503:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Though this work shows a significant and strong relationship between growth 
43:904:69574:28:27:90:500:423:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance and openness in key service sectors, discussion of these issues is in fact 
43:905:69661:27:28:90:517:396:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerably older.  Goldsmith (1969), in a seminal earlier piece, placed heavy stress on 
43:906:69751:28:28:90:493:368:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the role of financial services in allowing financial investments to flow to their most 
43:907:69838:28:27:90:524:340:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:productive uses, and hence in generating growth of output and income.  He suggested that 
43:908:69927:27:28:90:519:313:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the ratio of the value of financial intermediary assets to GNP was a variable that in some 
43:909:70018:28:27:90:525:285:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:way represented country performance of the financial sector.  He used it in a regression in 
43:910:70110:27:28:90:513:258:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which economic growth rates were the dependent variable, and found what he termed a 
43:911:70194:28:28:90:519:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:“rough parallelism” between growth performance and the level of financial development 
43:912:70280:28:27:90:518:202:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as represented by this variable.  This lead to later work all pointing in the same direction 
43:913:70373:27:28:90:521:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as recent work, namely that openness and degree of development of the service sectors is 
43:914:70462:28:61:90:313:147:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:associated with stronger growth performance.

43:916:70555:8:0:90:340:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 See again the discussion of these issues in Copeland (2002). 
44:917:70620:0:27:90:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: King and Levine (1993), in later work subsequently controlled for other factors 
44:918:70700:27:28:90:486:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:influencing long run growth performance.  They used further measures of country 
44:919:70780:28:27:90:505:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:development for the financial sector in their growth regressions, including the ratio of 
44:920:70869:27:28:90:496:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liabilities in the financial system to GDP and the ratio of gross claims on the private 
44:921:70957:28:28:90:523:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sector to GDP.    They found that these measures played an important role and implied an 
44:922:71046:28:27:90:500:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:econometrically significant relationship.  They assessed whether the level of country 
44:923:71132:27:28:90:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial sector development in 1960 as measured by one of their ratios predicted the rate 
44:924:71223:28:27:90:523:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of growth for the country over the 1960-1990 period, and found that the level of financial 
44:925:71314:27:28:90:517:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sector development in 1960 was a significant predictor of later period economic growth. 
44:926:71402:28:28:90:494:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In a later paper Levine (1997) further assessed the role that financial sectors 
44:927:71482:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:played in economic development.  He evaluated five functions performed by the financial 
44:928:71570:27:28:90:500:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services sector, including facilitating the trading of risk, allocating capital to its most 
44:929:71662:28:27:90:485:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:productive uses, monitoring managerial performance, mobilizing savings through 
44:930:71741:27:28:90:422:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial innovation, and easing the exchange of goods and services.

44:933:71837:27:28:90:502:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: It is only in more recent work, however, that the role of trade and openness in 
44:934:71917:28:27:90:498:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:service sectors and their influence on growth surfaces more explicitly.  Francois and 
44:935:72003:27:28:90:492:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Schuknecht (2000) regress growth rates of real per capita GDP on a measure of the 
44:936:72085:28:27:90:461:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:degree of openness in trade, key macroeconomic variables, and a measure of 
44:937:72160:27:28:90:502:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentration in the financial sector.  They find a strong relationship between growth 
44:938:72247:28:28:90:495:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rates and financial sector competition, this claim suggesting a positive link between 
44:939:72333:28:0:90:187:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:openness and trade. 
45:940:72355:0:27:90:519:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Mattoo, Rathindran, and Subramanian (2001) use policy rather than results based 
45:941:72435:27:28:90:468:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measures of openness of country services regimes (in contrast to Francois and 
45:942:72513:28:27:90:516:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Schuknecht).  They construct such openness measures for two key service sectors, basic 
45:943:72600:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:telecoms and financial services and use these in growth regressions.  Their econometric 
45:944:72688:28:28:90:525:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence shows that openness in service sectors influences long run growth performance.  
45:945:72777:28:27:90:495:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This link is relatively strong in the financial sector and less strong (but nevertheless 
45:946:72866:27:28:90:510:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant) in the telecommunications sector.  Their estimates suggest that 
45:947:72957:28:27:90:519:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with fully globally open telecom and financial service sectors, growth rates in individual 
45:948:73048:27:28:90:516:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economies may be up to 1.5 percentage points higher than for other countries with more

45:951:73151:27:28:90:249:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:5.3 Issues of Interpretation 
45:952:73179:28:27:90:503:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: At first sight this evidence seems striking, pointing to liberalization of service 
45:953:73262:27:28:90:466:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sectors as a route to faster growth and development, and suggesting that trade 
45:954:73341:28:27:90:502:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization in service sectors can also be key for developing countries in achieving 
45:955:73429:27:28:90:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enhanced growth performance.  There are, however, issues this work raises as with earlier 
45:956:73519:28:28:90:191:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work reviewed here. 
45:957:73539:28:27:90:480:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: One is that this work is generally a theoretical and does not provide solid 
45:958:73615:27:28:90:470:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analytical underpinnings for service trade liberalization and its links to growth 
45:959:73697:28:27:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance.  Although Francois and Schuknecht emphasize the role of scale economies 
45:960:73782:27:28:90:497:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and cost structures in financial services and the link to market structure, their theory 
45:961:73871:28:28:90:524:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:points (as in most theoretical work on trade liberalization) to once and for all level effects 
45:962:73966:28:0:90:518:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rather than permanent growth effects.  Thus whether elevated growth from liberalization 
46:963:74056:0:27:90:509:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is only a transitional effect, or a more permanent effect of longer standing is the issue.  
46:964:74148:27:28:90:512:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, there are parts of the endogenous growth literature (such as Young (1996)) that 
46:965:74236:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggest there are ways in which trade barriers which partly internalize an internalized 
46:966:74324:27:28:90:502:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:externalities can raise growth rates and protection can be welfare improving.  At first 
46:967:74412:28:28:90:486:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sight, such arguments might well also apply to services.  However, also following 
46:968:74494:28:27:90:484:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous growth literature, a key characteristic of services trade – the need for 
46:969:74578:27:28:90:490:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simultaneous production and consumption of the traded service – might imply that 
46:970:74659:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services liberalization moves resources from sectors that do not possess these attributes to 
46:971:74752:27:28:90:307:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those that do, and long run growth rates rise. 
46:972:74799:28:28:90:501:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Also, there are key issues with excluded variables in these analyses.  Thus, in 
46:973:74879:28:27:90:509:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discussing financial services liberalization, there is clear evidence that economies with 
46:974:74969:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher savings rates grow more quickly as investible funds are channelled into productive 
46:975:75059:28:27:90:520:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employment.  The links between financial structure and development are long discussed, 
46:976:75146:27:28:90:513:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in both McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973), for instance.  Financial intermediation will 
46:977:75232:28:27:90:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:thus correspondingly grow with savings as intermediation helps these savings flow from 
46:978:75319:27:28:90:523:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lenders to borrowers.  What drives the growth is primarily the higher level of savings and 
46:979:75410:28:28:90:518:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment, what facilitates the process is the intermediation.  Thus opening up financial 
46:980:75501:28:27:90:513:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services sectors to international competition where domestic savings rates are low need 
46:981:75589:27:28:90:500:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not facilitate higher growth, and to attribute higher growth rates to elevated financial 
46:982:75678:28:27:90:368:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intermediation alone can again potentially be misleading. 
46:983:75736:27:28:90:514:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: This econometric evidence, however, has been widely cited as showing a strong 
46:984:75814:28:0:90:519:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:link between financial services liberalization and growth performance; and if correct has 
47:985:75906:0:27:90:512:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:major implications for policy reform in developing countries.  The caveats noted above 
47:986:75993:27:0:90:359:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:should, however be kept in mind in interpreting results. 
48:987:76052:0:30:90:390:706:195:g_d0_f4:195:g_d0_f4:C:6. Sectoral Issues:  Health and Transportation 
48:988:76098:30:27:90:512:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Two key sectors which have attracted attention as possible areas for developing 
48:989:76178:27:28:90:527:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries to focus on in their services liberalization are health services and transportation.  
48:990:76274:28:28:90:500:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:These are briefly discussed here, even though model based analyses do not centre on 
48:991:76358:28:27:90:121:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these. 
48:992:76365:27:28:90:93:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
48:993:76365:28:27:90:208:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:6.1       Health       Services 
48:994:76396:27:28:90:525:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Here, it is often claimed that health services represent an area in which developing 
48:995:76481:28:27:90:492:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries have the potential to become major exporters; either by attracting foreign 
48:996:76566:27:28:90:498:456:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:patients to domestic hospitals and health care facilities or by sending health workers 
48:997:76653:28:28:90:503:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:abroad temporarily.  As Mattoo (1999) points out, Cuba provides an example of this.  
48:998:76738:28:27:90:487:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:There, government policy is to make Cuba into a world medical leader.  A trading 
48:999:76819:27:28:90:524:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company, SERVIMED, was created by the government to offer tourism/health packages.  
48:1000:76903:28:27:90:505:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In 1995/96, according to Mattoo, 25,000 patients and 1,500 students went to Cuba for 
48:1001:76988:27:28:90:518:318:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:treatment and training generating revenues for Cuba of US $25 million in the year.  Cost 
48:1002:77077:28:28:90:511:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:savings for both patients and insurers can be very significant.  Mattoo suggests that the 
48:1003:77167:28:27:90:519:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cost of coronary bypass surgery in India is about 5% of that in developed countries.  The 
48:1004:77257:27:28:90:517:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:UN and WHO (1998) estimate the cost of liver transplants in India to be about one tenth 
48:1005:77345:28:27:90:224:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of that in the United States. 
48:1006:77375:27:28:90:511:180:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: There are many barriers to international trade in health services, not the least of 
48:1007:77459:28:28:90:491:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which is portability of health insurance coverage.  For instance, US federal or state 
48:1008:77545:28:27:90:511:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:government employee coverage is limited to certified practitioners in the United States 
48:1009:77633:27:0:90:496:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(or a specified state.  The UN and WTO (1998)) estimate that 3% of the 100 elderly 
49:1010:77718:0:27:90:490:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:living in OECD countries retiring to developing countries would bring revenues of 
49:1011:77800:27:28:90:516:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perhaps US $10-15 billion a year in medical expenses to developing countries.  Another 
49:1012:77887:28:27:90:509:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:barrier is visa and house purchase/registration restrictions in the developing world that 
49:1013:77977:27:28:90:497:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:potential longer term patients face.  Prima facie, the potential benefits to developing 
49:1014:78065:28:28:90:511:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries in this area seem large, but there appears to be few or no quantitative studies. 
49:1015:78156:28:27:90:93:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
49:1016:78156:27:28:90:190:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:Transport Services 
49:1017:78174:28:27:90:495:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In the area of transport services, there is a general presumption that no other 
49:1018:78254:27:28:90:472:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services category has such a pronounced effect on both the level and pattern of 
49:1019:78334:28:28:90:492:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing county trade.  Internal transportation is costly and time consuming, and 
49:1020:78418:28:27:90:516:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presents barriers to trade in goods not only in terms of financial cost but also in terms of 
49:1021:78511:27:28:90:524:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spoilage and breakage.  In ocean shipping, negotiated bilateral freight rates between ports 
49:1022:78603:28:27:90:490:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of countries often imply large costs for transshipment between ports of developing 
49:1023:78686:27:28:90:522:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:countries.  Much inter developing country trade can take place via OECD ports (Lagos to 
49:1024:78774:28:27:90:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Accra via Rotterdam, for instance), and negotiated freight rates partially drive this.  (See 
49:1025:78867:27:28:90:222:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Zerby and Conlon (1983).) 
49:1026:78893:28:28:90:514:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In addition developing country suppliers of transportation services are restricted 
49:1027:78976:28:27:90:509:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in terms of access to developed country service markets.  The higher costs of domestic 
49:1028:79063:27:28:90:503:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providers can be very substantial, and so the benefits of developing country suppliers 
49:1029:79150:28:27:90:512:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gaining access to these markets could be very large.  Francois, Acre, Reinert and Flynn 
49:1030:79238:27:28:90:507:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(1996) in analyzing the Jones Act in the US which restricts coastal US shipping to US 
49:1031:79324:28:28:90:509:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:vessels suggests local US suppliers of shipping services are perhaps 300% more costly 
49:1032:79410:28:0:90:465:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than low cost foreign suppliers and compute large gains for the US from such 
50:1033:79489:0:27:90:499:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:liberalization.  It follows that large benefits would also accrue to developing country 
50:1034:79577:27:28:90:139:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suppliers. 
50:1035:79588:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Airline transportation represents another area where developing country gains 
50:1036:79666:27:28:90:503:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from improved access could be large due to their lower costs.  Exclusionary practices 
50:1037:79752:28:28:90:500:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such as cabotage and denied grant of fifth freedom rights exclude them from internal 
50:1038:79837:28:27:90:516:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developed country service markets.  These issues are discussed in Findlay (1997).  Thus 
50:1039:79925:27:28:90:509:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as in health services potentially significant gains would accrue to developing countries 
50:1040:80014:28:27:90:322:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from genuine multilateral service liberalization.

51:1043:80099:30:27:126:519:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This paper both discusses the potential impacts of services trade liberalization on 
51:1044:80183:27:28:90:507:649:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries and reviews existing quantitative studies.  Its purpose is to distill 
51:1045:80274:28:28:90:512:621:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:themes from studies rather than to advocate policy change.  The picture that emerges is 
51:1046:80362:28:27:90:524:593:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seemingly one of valiant attempts to quantify in the presence of formidable analytical and 
51:1047:80453:27:28:90:516:566:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data problems.  The basic intuition seems to be that with genuine two sided (OECD/non 
51:1048:80539:28:27:90:507:538:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:OECD) liberalization in services that are seemingly considerably labour intensive, the 
51:1049:80626:27:28:90:479:511:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:potential may be there for significant developing country gains.  This position is 
51:1050:80709:28:28:90:384:483:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seemingly not endorsed by studies, neither is it contradicted. 
51:1051:80772:28:27:126:515:455:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One difficulty with existing studies is that the conceptual underpinnings of trade 
51:1052:80855:27:28:90:512:428:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in services and how analytically this trade differs from trade in goods, if at all, needs to 
51:1053:80948:28:27:90:484:400:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be sorted out before impacts on developing countries are discussed.  Key here are 
51:1054:81030:27:28:90:483:373:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mobility issues for service providers (both firms and workers), and the functional 
51:1055:81113:28:28:90:485:345:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:treatment of individual service items (banking, insurance, telecoms, etc.).  Recent 
51:1056:81197:28:27:90:512:317:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analytical work suggests that liberalization in these service items need not always yield 
51:1057:81287:27:28:90:515:290:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains.  The discussion and measurement of barriers to service trade is also problematic.  
51:1058:81377:28:27:90:523:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:One is talking of domestic regulation, entry barriers, portability of providers, competition 
51:1059:81470:27:28:90:524:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policy regimes more so than barriers at national borders as with tariffs.  Both representing 
51:1060:81563:28:28:90:447:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and quantifying barriers raise major difficulties, and these are spelled out. 
51:1061:81641:28:27:126:498:179:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As a result, numerical modelling work on the effects of service trade barriers 
51:1062:81720:27:28:90:483:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which uses ad valorem equivalent modelling is not fully convincing.  In addition, 
51:1063:81802:28:27:90:523:124:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individual country results vary considerably across studies in ways it is hard for outsiders 
51:1064:81895:27:0:90:511:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to recognize.  Studies do, however, point towards a tentative conclusion that effects are 
52:1065:81987:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:small and positive for most countries if FDI flow changes are absent, but much larger and 
52:1066:82077:27:28:90:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more variable across countries if they are present.  This all perhaps suggests that mode 3 
52:1067:82168:28:27:90:496:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:GATS liberalization (roughly captured in some studies) could be very important for 
52:1068:82251:27:28:90:500:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing countries; Mode 4 GATS liberalization (not covered) is likely even more 
52:1069:82334:28:28:90:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:important given large barriers to labour flows across countries and recent initial studies 
52:1070:82425:28:27:90:235:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:clearly point in this direction. 
52:1071:82458:27:28:126:505:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:If service trade liberalization is a surrogate for improved functioning of global 
52:1072:82540:28:27:90:497:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factor markets in which more capital flows to developing countries and more labour 
52:1073:82623:27:28:90:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flows from then, developing countries could benefit in a major way.  The paper concludes
