2:17:332:20:21:100:103:533:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
2:18:332:21:21:100:517:512:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper develops a model of international trade based on the division of labor and 
2:19:418:21:20:100:518:491:144:Times:144:Times:A:comparative  advantage.  Labor  is  used  to  produce  traded  intermediate  inputs  which  
2:20:510:20:21:100:517:471:144:Times:144:Times:A:are used in the production of traded final goods. Large countries gain relatively more 
2:21:597:21:21:100:518:450:144:Times:144:Times:A:from  comparative  advantage  than  from  the  division  of  labor,  while  the  opposite  is  
2:22:692:21:20:100:518:429:144:Times:144:Times:A:true  for  small  countries. Large  countries  export  a  smaller  share  of  final  goods  and  a  
2:23:792:20:21:100:520:409:144:Times:144:Times:A:larger  share  of  intermediate  goods  than  small  countries.  These  predictions  find  
2:24:883:21:21:100:258:388:144:Times:144:Times:A:supportive evidence in the data.

3:32:1254:0:22:72:188:707:197:Times:197:Times:C:1  Introduction 
3:33:1269:22:21:72:75:685:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:34:1269:21:21:72:544:664:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  third  paragraph  of  the  first  chapter  of  Adam  Smith’s  The  Wealth  of  Nations  (Smith,  1776)  
3:35:1378:21:21:71:543:643:144:Times:144:Times:B:contains  the  famous  passage  in  which  he  describes  the  impact  of  the  division  of  labor  on 
3:36:1482:21:20:71:545:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity  in  a  pin  factory.  To  paraphrase  Smith,  one  worker,  working  on  his  own,  could  
3:37:1587:20:21:71:543:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:produce  at  most  20  pins  in  a  day.  Ten  workers,  dividing  up  the  tasks  of  producing  pins,  could  
3:38:1699:21:21:71:543:581:144:Times:144:Times:B:produce 48,000 pins in a day. Hence, the gain to this group of workers from the division of labor 
3:39:1796:21:20:71:546:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  this  example  is  24,000%. One  implication  of  this  is  that  international  trade,  by  enabling  
3:40:1903:20:21:71:397:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater levels of specialization, should result in productivity gains.  
3:41:1974:21:21:71:74:519:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:42:1974:21:20:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:B:This paper develops a model of international trade in which the gains from the division of labor 
3:43:2070:20:21:71:543:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:play a central role, as an additional reason for trade. As in Adam Smith’s example, the more the 
3:44:2167:21:21:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:production process can be divided into discrete stages, the larger will be the final output. That is, 
3:45:2269:21:21:71:544:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:we  explicitly  model the  division  of  labor,  going  beyond  previous  treatments  that  make  use  of  
3:46:2376:21:20:72:546:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:external  economies.  In  addition,  we  combine  the  division  of  labor  with  Ricardo’s  (1817)  
3:47:2477:20:21:72:547:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative  advantage,  and  show  how  the  interplay  between  these  two  economic  forces  
3:48:2573:21:21:72:543:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:determines the outcomes and the gains from trade. In the model, countries specialize in different 
3:49:2671:21:20:72:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsets of intermediate goods, then trade both intermediate and final goods. The gains from trade 
3:50:2769:20:21:72:543:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:arise  from  both increased  division  of  labor,  and specialization  in  accordance  with  comparative  
3:51:2875:21:21:71:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:advantage. Large  countries  gain  relatively  more  from  comparative  advantage  than  from  the  
3:52:2975:21:20:71:380:291:144:Times:144:Times:B:division of labor, while the opposite is true for small countries.  
3:53:3042:20:21:71:74:271:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:54:3042:21:21:71:543:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:A key testable prediction of the model is that country size is negatively associated with the share 
3:55:3142:21:20:71:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  consumption  goods  in  its  exports,  and  is  positively  associated  with  the  share  of  intermediate  
3:56:3254:20:21:71:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods  in  its  exports.  Using  data  from  the  UN  Comtrade  database,  we  find  evidence  which  
3:57:3356:21:21:71:544:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:supports  these  predictions  of  the  model.  This  work  is  broadly  related  to  the  empirical  literature  
3:58:3469:21:21:71:543:167:144:Times:144:Times:B:on  trade  in  intermediate  goods  and  services.  For  instance,  Miroudot  et  al  (2009)  and  Sturgeon  
3:59:3578:21:20:71:542:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Memedovic (2010) show that intermediate inputs represent over half of total goods trade, but 
3:60:3675:20:21:71:349:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:that this fraction has actually decreased since the 1960s.   
3:61:3736:21:0:71:74:105:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:62:3738:0:21:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:There has  been  a  recent  resurgence  of  interest  in  models  of  international  trade  based  on  the  
4:63:3846:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:division  of  labor.  A  large  portion  of  this  literature  revolves  around  models  based  on  external 
4:64:3955:21:20:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:scale  economies,  for  instance  Grossman  and  Rossi-Hansberg  (2010)  and  Ethier  and  Ruffin  
4:65:4054:20:21:72:545:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2009).  Choi  and  Yu  (2003)  survey  the  earlier  literature  on  international  trade  under  external  
4:66:4163:21:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:scale  economies,  while  Wong  (2001)  offers  an  alternative  treatment.  Relative  to  this  literature,  
4:67:4273:21:20:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  present  paper  develops  an  explicit  model  of  the  division  of  labor,  rather  than  basing  it  on  
4:68:4386:20:21:72:174:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:external economies.  
4:69:4406:21:21:72:75:564:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:70:4406:21:21:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:More  closely  related  to  the  present  paper  are  Swanson  (1999),  Zhou  (2004),  and  Chaney  and  
4:71:4511:21:20:72:547:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ossa  (2013).  Swanson  (1999)  develops  a  model  in  which  a  larger  market  size  leads  to  
4:72:4610:20:21:72:544:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity  gains,  because  workers  specialize  in  a  narrower  subset  of  activities.  Zhou  (2004)  
4:73:4718:21:21:71:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:develops a very different model which makes a similar point. Chaney and Ossa (2013) extend the 
4:74:4813:21:20:71:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:new trade model of Krugman (1979) to allow for multiple production stages. However, Swanson 
4:75:4905:20:21:71:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1999)  does  not  explicitly  consider  the  implications  of  international  trade;  the  structure  of  the  
4:76:5017:21:21:71:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:model  means  that  this  is  not  a  straightforward  analysis.  In  addition,  unlike  Zhou  (2004)  and  
4:77:5125:21:20:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chaney  and  Ossa  (2013),  our  model  is  based  on  perfect  competition,  so  presents  an  alternative  
4:78:5234:20:21:72:236:378:144:Times:122:g_d0_f8:B:approach to the division of labor.  
4:79:5269:21:21:72:75:357:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:80:5269:21:21:72:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Also closely related to  the  present  paper  are  Ethier  (1979,  1982).  The  nature  of  the  division  of  
4:81:5380:21:20:71:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor in this paper is similar to that in Ethier (1979, 1982). The main difference is that here, we 
4:82:5480:20:21:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:explicitly  model the  division  of  labor  as  in  Ethier  (1982),  but  the  production  of  intermediate  
4:83:5589:21:21:71:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:inputs is perfectly competitive. Indeed, where Ethier (1982) has two sources of scale economies 
4:84:5685:21:20:71:543:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(internal to the firm, and due to the division of labor) and one source of comparative advantage 
4:85:5782:20:21:72:542:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:(factor  endowment  differences  across  countries),  in  the  present  paper,  there  is  one  source  of 
4:86:5889:21:21:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative advantage (between final goods), and one source of scale economies (the division of 
4:87:5985:21:20:71:544:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:labor).    In addition, whilst in Ethier (1982) the market structure is monopolistically competitive, 
4:88:6087:20:21:71:300:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:here we adopt perfect competition throughout.  
4:89:6134:21:21:71:74:150:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:90:6134:21:21:71:545:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  next  section  presents  the  main  features  of  the  model.  Section  3  outlines  the  autarkic  
4:91:6239:21:0:71:542:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:equilibrium, while Section 4 considers the implications of international trade. Section 5 discusses 
5:92:6341:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:the trade  patterns  that  arise  in  the  model and  provides  some  supportive  empirical  evidence. 
5:93:6444:21:21:72:177:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 6 concludes.

5:95:6465:22:23:72:178:645:197:Times:197:Times:C:2 The model

5:97:6478:20:22:72:543:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:There are two countries, 푗=퐻,퐹 for Home and Foreign. Labor is the only factor of production, 
5:98:6571:22:22:72:543:580:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the  two  countries  have  labor  endowments 퐿푗.  All  markets  are  perfectly  competitive.  There 
5:99:6675:22:21:71:543:558:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  two  final  consumption  goods,  1  and  2.  Consumer  utility  is  identical  across  countries  and 
5:100:6781:21:21:71:217:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:takes a Cobb-Douglas form1:

5:102:6881:21:21:72:543:495:144:Times:144:Times:B:Where 퐶 denotes consumption of a good. Final goods are produced with intermediate inputs, and 
5:103:6975:21:21:72:547:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:assembly  of  final  goods  is  assumed  to  be  costless.  Each  country  produces  a  number  of  
5:104:7075:21:23:72:547:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  inputs 푛푗,  which  is  assumed  to  be  small  relative  to  the  number  of  possible  
5:105:7176:23:20:72:544:430:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  inputs.  Assume  that  the  intermediate  inputs  produced  in  one  country  are  different  
5:106:7284:20:21:72:542:410:144:Times:144:Times:B:from those produced in the other country. All intermediate inputs are used in fixed proportions in 
5:107:7383:21:21:72:544:389:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  production  of  final  goods.  Hence  let  the  production  functions  of the  final  goods  in  the  two  
5:108:7495:21:21:72:139:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries be:

5:113:7599:21:21:72:542:260:144:Times:144:Times:B:Output of each final good depends on the number of Home and Foreign produced inputs, 푛퐻 and

5:115:7785:21:21:72:547:218:144:Times:144:Times:B:technological  advantage  in  final good  1,  while  Foreign  has  a  comparative  technological  
5:116:7883:21:21:72:543:197:144:Times:144:Times:B:advantage in final good 2. It will be shown below that in free trade Home will specialize in good 
5:117:7981:21:21:72:544:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:1  and  Foreign  in  good  2. 훽>0 measures  the  payoff  from  the  division  of  labor.  The  larger  the  
5:118:8089:21:21:72:543:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of intermediate inputs 푛, the greater the division of labor, and the larger the output of the

5:120:8297:21:23:72:545:113:144:Times:144:Times:B:final  goods  exhibits  constant  returns  to  scale  with  respect  to  the  quantity  of  each  input,  and  
5:121:8408:23:16:72:542:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 The model can also be solved using CES preferences; the Cobb-Douglas form used here makes the solution much 
5:122:8518:16:0:72:332:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:simpler, and does not detract from the main results of the paper.  
5:123:8586:0:0:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f8:122:g_d0_f8:F:                                                           
6:124:8644:0:21:72:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing  returns  with  respect  to  the  number  of  different  inputs.  The  constant  returns  to  scale  
6:125:8756:21:21:72:545:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:feature  makes  the  production  function  compatible  with  perfect  competition:  a  larger  firm  does  
6:126:8863:21:20:72:326:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:not have a cost advantage relative to a smaller firm.  
6:127:8918:20:21:72:75:647:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:128:8918:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since all inputs are used in fixed proportions in the production of the final goods, output of each 
6:129:9018:21:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  good  must  also  be  the  same.  Each  country  has  the  ability  to  produce  a  subset  
6:130:9124:21:22:72:545:584:144:g_d0_f10:144:Times:B:푛푗=푟퐿푗 of  intermediate  goods,  푖=1, ...,푟퐿푗,  where  푟<1 is  a  constant,  and  the  intermediate  
6:131:9225:22:21:72:544:562:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods  produced  by  each  country  are  unique  to  that  country.  The  uniqueness  of  each  country’s  
6:132:9332:21:20:72:544:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  goods  may  be  caused  by  (unmodelled)  sector-specific  inputs  which  are  unique  to  
6:133:9437:20:21:72:544:521:144:Times:144:Times:B:each country, for instance natural resources. This strong assumption2 implies that the number of 
6:134:9534:21:21:72:545:500:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  goods  produced  by  each  country  (hence  the  extent  of  the  division  of  labor)  is  
6:135:9640:21:20:72:544:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:proportional to the size of the market, as in Adam Smith’s example. The assumption that larger 
6:136:9735:20:21:72:544:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries  produce  a  larger  variety  of  goods  has  empirical  support  from  Hummels  and  Klenow  
6:137:9839:21:21:72:542:438:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2005)  and  Hanson  (2012).  Let  the  production  technology  of  intermediate  inputs  be  identical 
6:138:9943:21:21:72:157:417:144:Times:144:Times:B:across countries:

6:140:9977:22:21:72:543:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:Production of intermediate inputs occurs under constant returns to scale. As a result of equation 
6:141:10075:21:20:72:544:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:(6), the price of each intermediate good is, under perfect competition, equal to the wage rate in 
6:142:10173:20:21:71:546:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:each  country.  Assume  that  wage  rates  are  equalised  across  countries,  and  hence  that  all  
6:143:10275:21:21:71:275:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate goods have the same price3.

6:147:10326:21:20:72:543:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consider first the case where the two countries do not trade with each other. Here we analyse the 
6:148:10424:20:34:72:543:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:Home country; the solution for the Foreign country is analogous. In this case, Foreign-produced 
6:149:10520:34:16:72:543:171:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 Note  that,  without  this  assumption,  if  each  country  can  produce  all  possible  varieties  of  intermediate  goods,  then  
6:150:10654:16:12:72:543:155:99:g_d0_f10:99:Times:F:푛=∞ yields  the  largest  possible  output  of  the  final  goods,  even  if  a  country  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  a  
6:151:10783:12:7:71:479:143:99:Times:99:Times:F:subset of intermediate goods. So this is a strong assumption made to overcome a technical difficulty.  
6:152:10885:7:16:72:543:136:42:Times:99:Times:F:3 This  assumption  means  that,  in  the  free  trade  equilibrium,  intermediate  goods  produced  in  the  two  countries  are  
6:153:11016:16:12:71:543:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:indistinguishable from each other. It can be seen that, without this assumption, it is possible that one country has a 
6:154:11135:12:11:71:543:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:higher  wage  rate  than  the  other  country  (possible  due  to  the  complementarity  of  intermediate  inputs),  leading  to  
6:155:11265:11:11:71:543:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:higher  prices  of  that  country’s  intermediate  goods,  and  hence  final  goods  producers  will  face  a  choice  between  
6:156:11393:11:12:71:542:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:incurring a higher cost of using both countries’ intermediate goods, or foregoing the benefits of increased division of

7:161:11776:21:20:71:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:each country will produce both final goods in autarky, and because production of each final good

7:173:12392:21:21:72:543:450:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since all intermediate inputs are produced using the same technology, and since all intermediate

8:232:15526:47:16:72:542:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:5 If trade in intermediate goods is defined to be intra-industry trade, while trade in final goods is inter-industry, then

9:247:16082:20:21:72:543:609:144:Times:144:Times:B:As might be expected, the gains from trade increase the smaller is the country, or the larger is the 
9:248:16183:21:21:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:B:trading partner. In fact, from equation (14), it can be seen that utility under free trade depends on

9:255:16741:21:21:72:547:442:144:Times:144:Times:B:It  is  possible  to  decompose  the  total  gains  from  trade  into  the  component  derived  from

9:269:17276:21:21:72:545:220:144:Times:144:Times:B:Note  from  equation  (17)  that  the  gain  from  comparative  advantage  is  independent  of  country  
9:270:17381:21:20:72:543:199:144:Times:144:Times:B:sizes, whereas from equation (18) the gain from the division of labor increases the smaller is the 
9:271:17480:20:21:72:546:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:country relative to its trading partner.  Hence the primary source of the gains from trade for small 
9:272:17581:21:21:72:543:158:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries is the division of labor, while for large countries it is comparative advantage. We have:

10:280:17938:21:21:72:543:643:144:Times:144:Times:B:As noted in Section 2 above, the two countries are symmetric in every way except one: their size. 
10:281:18036:21:20:72:544:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:Similarly, the two final goods and all intermediate goods are also symmetric in every way, and 
10:282:18131:20:21:72:546:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:assembly  of  final  goods  from  intermediate  goods  is  costless.  As  a  result,  the  total  value  of  
10:283:18240:21:21:72:545:581:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate  goods  output  is  equal  to  the  total  value  of  final  goods  output,  and  the  two  final  
10:284:18352:21:20:72:542:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods  are  produced  in  proportion  to  the  parameters  of  the  Cobb-Douglas  utility  function  and 
10:285:18457:20:21:71:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:have  equal  prices.  However,  with  homothetic  preferences,  the  larger  country  will  consume  a  
10:286:18561:21:21:71:542:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger fraction of each final good, in direct proportion to the country’s size. As a result, if trade is 
10:287:18666:21:20:71:545:498:144:Times:144:Times:B:balanced, the  share  of  the  final  good  in  a  country’s  exports  will  be  negatively  related  to  the  
10:288:18777:20:21:71:543:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:country’s  size,  while  the  share  of  intermediate  goods  will  be  positively  related  to  the  country’s

10:309:19762:21:21:72:543:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:since a larger country implies more intermediate goods and hence lower production cost through

11:346:21457:21:21:72:547:222:144:Times:144:Times:B:database,  using  data  for  2010.  We  make  use  of  the  Broad  Economic  Categories  (BEC)  
11:347:21553:21:20:72:543:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:classification  which  divides  industries  into  capital  goods,  intermediate  goods, consumption 
11:348:21653:20:21:72:544:181:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods,  and  “unclassified”  (see  United  Nations  (2002)  for  details  of  the  classification).  For  our  
11:349:21764:21:21:71:542:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis, we drop the “unclassified” category before calculating the share of each type of good in 
11:350:21863:21:20:71:543:139:144:Times:144:Times:B:total exports6. Our sample consists of 134 countries, and in the sample, the share of consumption 
11:351:21961:20:40:72:543:119:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods in total exports is 26.3%, while the share of intermediate goods is 65.6%, and the share of 
11:352:22059:40:0:72:422:79:42:Times:99:Times:F:6 Including the “unclassified” category leads to similar results to those reported below.

12:357:22518:20:21:72:539:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:clear  negative  relationship  between  the  two  variables,  as  predicted  by  Proposition  3 (corr  =  -

12:360:22658:20:21:72:543:585:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 1 reports the results of a regression analysis of the relationship between the consumption 
12:361:22755:21:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:share  of  exports  and  country  size.  Country  size  is  measured  using  one  of  the  three measures 
12:362:22861:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:above: GDP in real PPP and real US dollar terms, and population, all in natural logs. A series of 
12:363:22959:21:20:72:547:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:bivariate  regressions  is  reported  with  these  three measures  in  Panel  A  of  Table  1,  with  
12:364:23061:20:21:72:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:B:heteroskedastic-robust  standard  errors.  All  the  size  measures  are  negatively  and  significantly  
12:365:23167:21:21:72:288:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to the consumption share of exports.  
12:366:23213:21:20:72:75:460:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
12:367:23213:20:21:72:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:It is possible that the relationship between country size and the consumption share of exports is 
12:368:23311:21:21:72:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:different  for  different  groups  of  countries.  Panel  B  of  Table  1  reports  results  of  the  same  
12:369:23419:21:20:72:545:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:regressions,  this  time  including  a  dummy  for  the  OECD  and  an  interaction  term  between  this  
12:370:23525:20:21:72:543:378:144:Times:144:Times:B:dummy and the size measure. The OECD dummy and the interaction term are never significantly 
12:371:23617:21:21:72:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to the consumption share of exports, and inclusion of these variables does not change the 
12:372:23715:21:21:72:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative relationship between country size and the consumption share of exports. Finally, Panel 
12:373:23810:21:20:72:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:C  of  Table  1  reports  results  including  continent  dummies.  Once  again  this  does  not  change  the  
12:374:23920:20:21:72:468:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative relationship between country size and the consumption share of exports.

12:376:24001:21:20:72:545:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Of  course,  what  Table  1  shows  is  that  country  size  and  the  consumption  share  of  exports  are  
12:377:24110:20:21:72:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:B:negatively related; it does not imply that one causes the other, or indeed that the model proposed 
12:378:24209:21:21:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:in this paper is the “true” explanation for the observed patterns in the data. What it does suggest, 
12:379:24310:21:20:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, is that the model’s prediction with respect to the relationship between country size and 
12:380:24408:20:21:72:474:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:the consumption share of exports is  at least consistent with the empirical evidence.

13:386:24510:22:21:72:75:685:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
13:387:24510:21:21:72:543:664:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  paper  develops  a  model  of  international  trade  based  on  the  division  of  labor  and 
13:388:24610:21:21:72:543:643:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative  advantage,  going  beyond  the  usual  assumption  of  external  scale  economies  to 
13:389:24708:21:20:72:547:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:clarify the implications of the division of labor.  Unlike most of the prior literature, the model is 
13:390:24810:20:21:72:543:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:perfectly competitive throughout. The extent of the division of labor is determined by the size of 
13:391:24909:21:21:72:543:581:144:Times:144:Times:B:the market, whereas the gains from international trade arise from the division of the production 
13:392:25006:21:20:72:547:560:144:Times:144:Times:B:process into  increasing  numbers  of  stages  and  from  comparative  advantage  in  final  goods.  It  is  
13:393:25115:20:21:72:546:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown  that  large  countries  gain  relatively more  from  comparative  advantage  than  from  the  
13:394:25216:21:21:72:547:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:division   of   labor,   whereas   the   opposite   is   true   for   small   countries. Countries   exchange   
13:395:25328:21:20:72:544:498:144:Times:144:Times:B:intermediate inputs which are used in the production of final goods, which are then traded with 
13:396:25424:20:21:72:545:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:each  other.  In  addition,  the  model  predicts  that  larger  countries  will  have  a  smaller  share  of  
13:397:25535:21:21:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:consumption goods in their exports, and a larger share of intermediate goods. These predictions 
13:398:25631:21:21:72:358:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:find supportive evidence from the UN Comtrade database.  
13:399:25687:21:20:72:75:415:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
13:400:25687:20:21:72:544:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:The model developed in this paper relies quite heavily on several strong assumptions, especially 
13:401:25784:21:21:72:543:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:those regarding the production of intermediate inputs and their prices. As discussed in the paper, 
13:402:25883:21:20:72:542:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:these assumptions help sidestep some analytically difficult issues. Future work will address these 
13:403:25982:20:21:72:542:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:issues  directly,  as  well  as  developing  a  more  general  approach  that  would  be  amenable  to  the 
13:404:26090:21:21:72:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis  of  related  issues  such  as  trade  costs.  Nevertheless,  it  is  hoped  that  the  present  paper  
13:405:26203:21:20:72:544:291:144:Times:144:Times:B:helps  to  shed  some  light  on the  role  of  the  division  of  labor,  and the  relationship  between  the  
13:406:26315:20:21:72:400:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:division of labor and comparative advantage, in international trade.
