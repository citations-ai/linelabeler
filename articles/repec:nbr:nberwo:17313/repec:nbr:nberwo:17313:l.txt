2:24:986:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This paper documents the abnormally slow recovery in the labor market during the Great Recession,
2:25:1083:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and analyzes how mortgage modification policies contributed to delayed recovery. By making modifications
2:26:1187:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:means-tested by reducing mortgage payments based on a borrower's current income, these programs
2:27:1282:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:change the incentive for households to relocate from a relatively poor labor market to a better labor
2:28:1383:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:market. We find that modifications raise the unemployment rate by about 0.5 percentage points, and
2:29:1481:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:reduce output by about 1 percent, reflecting both lower employment and lower productivity, which
2:30:1577:14:42:72:436:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:is the result of individuals losing skills as unemployment duration is longer.

3:43:1871:0:34:72:208:703:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:44:1888:34:14:72:540:669:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The Great Recession differs considerably from most other significant U.S. economic declines,
3:45:1980:14:15:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the recovery, particularly recovery in the labor market, has been remarkably slow.  In fact,
3:46:2075:15:14:72:540:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the Great Recession and the Great Depression are the only severe U.S. downturns in which
3:47:2163:14:14:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:job loss persisted so long following respective business cycle troughs.  This paper documents
3:48:2256:14:15:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  very  weak  labor  market  recovery  during  the  Great  Recession  and  evaluates  mortgage
3:49:2353:15:14:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification policies as one channel for understanding why high unemployment has continued
3:50:2443:14:15:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for so long during the Great Recession.  We study mortgage modifications as some economists
3:51:2534:15:14:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have presented evidence linking housing market weakness to labor market weakness (Ohanian
3:52:2623:14:15:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Raffo, 2011), and because mortgage modification programs are means tested, and thus
3:53:2710:15:14:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change the incentives for home borrowers to relocate to labor markets with more favorable
3:54:2799:14:22:72:143:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:job prospects.
3:55:2813:22:14:89:539:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Means-tested mortgage modifications reduce the cost of staying in a home by reducing
3:56:2897:14:15:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mortgage payments, with the payment reduction based on the household’s current earnings.
3:57:2985:15:14:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This includes cases in which borrower income is limited to unemployment benefits and bor-
3:58:3074:14:15:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rower current debt to income ratio is well above standard levels, so that a modified mortgage
3:59:3167:15:14:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payment can be much lower than current payments.  Mulligan (2009 and 2010), among oth-
3:60:3253:14:14:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ers, has suggested that this policy may be significantly contributing to high unemployment
3:61:3343:14:15:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by distorting incentives.  In addition to concerns about incentives, modification programs are
3:62:3437:15:14:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controversial because redefault rates, which are the percentage of defaults on the modified
3:63:3528:14:22:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mortgage, are high, ranging between 30 percent and 50 percent within one year of modifying.
3:64:3619:22:14:89:539:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper evaluates the impact of mortgage modification programs on unemployment
3:65:3700:14:15:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and other macroeconomic variables by constructing a very simple model that integrates a
3:66:3787:15:14:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of search unemployment along the lines of Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998, 2002) with a
3:67:3877:14:15:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of home ownership, including mortgages, mortgage modifications, and location choice.
3:68:3967:15:14:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:By reducing mortgage payments based on current income, mortgage modification changes
3:69:4051:14:15:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the incentives to accept job offers and to relocate to labor markets with more favorable job
3:70:4143:15:21:72:123:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prospects.
3:71:4153:21:15:89:539:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the model, households are located in a particular local labor market (island), in which
3:72:4243:15:14:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they  receive  stochastic  job  offers  and  whose  skills  evolve  over  time,  as  in  Ljungqvist  and
3:73:4347:14:15:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Sargent (1998, 2002).  Households can accept the job offer and remain in their local labor
3:74:4437:15:14:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market,  reject  the  offer  and  receive  unemployment  benefits,  or  relocate  to  another  labor
3:75:4537:14:15:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market.  If the household has a mortgage, they choose whether to continue with an exist-
3:76:4625:15:14:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing mortgage, which preserves their current flow of housing services, whether to walk away
3:77:4715:14:14:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the mortgage and rent either in their current labor market or rent in an alternative
3:78:4804:14:15:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor market, or whether to seek a one-time modification of their mortgage which reduces
3:79:4892:15:14:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mortgage payments.  Relocating is costly, but offers a job finding probability that stochasti-
3:80:4986:14:15:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cally dominates the job finding probability on a household’s current island.  While employed,
3:81:5079:15:0:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households accumulate skill in expectation, and while unemployed, households decumulate
4:82:5167:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:skill in expectation.  By changing the cost to a borrower of maintaining an existing mortgage,
4:83:5261:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modifications increase the incentives for a household to remain in their current location and
4:84:5354:14:22:72:353:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forgo more favorable job prospects in another location.
4:85:5409:22:14:89:539:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our  model  of  the  modification  process  is  motivated  by  various  modification  programs
4:86:5503:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that have been in place since 2007, in which modifications reduce mortgage payments to a
4:87:5591:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:debt service-to-income ratio (DTI) that depends on current income.  Thus, households with
4:88:5680:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low income, including those whose income is limited to unemployment benefits, can receive
4:89:5769:14:15:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantial reductions in their payments that increase the opportunity cost of relocating in
4:90:5861:15:22:72:173:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model economy.
4:91:5879:22:14:89:539:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  first  analyze  the  implications  of  modifications  by  examining  steady  states  of  two
4:92:5975:14:14:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economies that are identical except one has modifications.  We next conduct an economic
4:93:6062:14:15:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turbulence experiment along the lines of Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) to assess how mod-
4:94:6151:15:14:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ifications  impact  the  economy  during  a  major  recession.   This  experiment  consists  of  two
4:95:6251:14:15:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks:  (i) the layoff rate in the model is doubled for one period, and (ii) for those who are
4:96:6346:15:14:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:laid off, their human capital stock is reduced by one level.  The main finding from this ex-
4:97:6438:14:15:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:periment is that the unemployment rate rises by about 0.5 percentage points, and real GDP
4:98:6527:15:14:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:declines by about 1 percent for several years after the modification policies are in place.  A
4:99:6621:14:15:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:number of empirical features in the model economy correspond to data, including the rate
4:100:6709:15:14:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of modifications, the redefault rate on modifications, and mobility.  We also estimate that a
4:101:6802:14:14:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:10% reduction in payments reduces the chance of a person walking away from a home by
4:102:6886:14:15:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:11.3% which is comparable to Haughwout,  Okah,  and Tracy (2009).  We are then able to
4:103:6972:15:14:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate that mortgagors who have a job at the date they request a modification are 48%
4:104:7059:14:22:72:209:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less likely to default again.
4:105:7088:22:14:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.   Section  2  compares  the  Great  Recession  to  other

4:114:7770:14:15:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of patterns that contrast sharply with those in other downturns.  Figure 1 shows employ-

5:121:8324:14:15:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment  change  in  all  post  World  War  II  recessions  36  months  after  the  start  of  the
5:122:8425:15:14:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recession.  There are only two postwar recessions that do not feature employment recovery
5:123:8514:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3 years after the start of a recession - the 2000-01 recession and the Great Recession.  Note,
5:124:8608:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however,  that the 2000-01 recession was relatively mild so that despite the slow recovery,
5:125:8699:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment was only about one percent lower three years after the start of that recession.
5:126:8789:14:15:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, employment during Great Recession is nearly 6 percent lower three years after
5:127:8879:15:14:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it started.  In terms of the most recent severe recessions, both the 1973 and 1981 recessions
5:128:8972:14:15:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feature rapid labor market recoveries, with employment rising three percent above previous

5:134:9237:15:14:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  other  recessions,  and  present  additional  evidence  that  the  recovery  from  the  Great
5:135:9335:14:15:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Depression has been very slow.  Table 1 shows the average recovery for detrended (2 percent
5:136:9426:15:14:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:annual growth) per capita output and its components and per capita employment through 6
5:137:9513:14:15:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quarters for all postwar recessions except the Great Recession.  In the average recovery from
5:138:9606:15:14:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  postwar  recession,  the  economy  is  quite  close  to  returning  to  trend.   Table  2  shows  the
5:139:9710:14:15:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same variables for the Great Recession, which shows virtually no recovery relative to trend
5:140:9801:15:14:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for any variable, with the exception of investment.  This pattern is qualitatively very similar
5:141:9896:14:22:72:237:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to that in the Great Depression.

5:145:10058:14:15:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cession in the U.S. The recovery from the 1981-82 recession is quite fast, with all variables,
5:146:10152:15:14:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:including employment, either very close to trend or even above trend.  This rapid recovery

5:148:10335:15:14:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicts that recoveries should be relatively fast following severe recessions, reflecting tran-
5:149:10431:14:15:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sition dynamics associated with diminishing marginal product of capital and low investment
5:150:10521:15:21:72:177:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during the recession.

5:152:10563:22:14:89:539:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This evidence indicates that the recovery from the Great Recession has been compara-
5:153:10647:14:15:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tively very slow, with the restoration of jobs and output proceeding much more slowly than
5:154:10737:15:21:72:190:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their postwar averages.
5:155:10760:21:0:89:539:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The only comparable episode in which a severe downturn was followed by such a slow
6:156:10843:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovery  is  the  Great  Depression.   Table  3  shows  the  severe  depth  and  duration  of  the
6:157:10942:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Depression, with relatively little recovery after its 1933 trough.  Specifically, relative to 1929,
6:158:11041:14:15:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per capita output is about 39 percent below trend, consumption is about 28 percent below
6:159:11129:15:14:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trend,  investment  is  about  75  percent  below  trend,  and  employment  is  about  25  percent
6:160:11227:14:14:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below trend.  And both the Great Depression and the Great Recession feature virtually no
6:161:11315:14:15:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recovery in consumption,  indicating that factors that are considered to be permanent are
6:162:11404:15:21:72:243:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contributing to the slow recovery.

6:164:11459:22:15:89:539:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:What  accounts  for  such  slow  recoveries,  particularly  in  the  labor  market  during  these
6:165:11556:15:14:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:episodes?   Ohanian  (2009),  and  Cole  and Ohanian  (2004)  present  theoretic  and  empirical
6:166:11652:14:14:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence that the severity of the Depression and the continuation of Depression significantly
6:167:11745:14:15:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reflect industrial and labor policies that increased industrial cartelization and increased labor
6:168:11842:15:14:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power which in turn substantially increased relative prices and real wages.  The
6:169:11933:14:15:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real manufacturing wages (relative to trend) rose approximately 17 percent from 1929 - 1939,
6:170:12025:15:14:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is abnormal from the perspective of the normal forces of supply and demand.  Specifi-
6:171:12116:14:15:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cally, low consumption and high unemployment during the decade should have reduced real
6:172:12203:15:14:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages and expanded employment relative to its low level.  Ohanian (2009) presents evidence
6:173:12293:14:15:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that high real wages during the early phases of the Depression were the result of Hoover’s
6:174:12383:15:14:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal wage maintenance program in which Hoover promised firms protection from labor
6:175:12468:14:14:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unions provided that industry maintain nominal wage levels and preserve jobs through work
6:176:12557:14:15:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sharing, while Cole and Ohanian (2004) present evidence that New Deal policies that pro-
6:177:12645:15:14:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:moted monopoly and union formation, including the National Industrial Recovery Act, and
6:178:12732:14:22:72:387:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the National Labor Relations Act, fostered higher real wages.
6:179:12793:22:14:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This interpretation of the Great Depression places economic policy, in particular, policies
6:180:12884:14:15:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that distorted competition and prevented some markets from clearing, at the center of the
6:181:12973:15:14:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Great Depression and its labor market dysfunction.  Some economists have also suggested
6:182:13060:14:15:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  economic  policies  are  contributing  to  the  persistence  of  high  unemployment  today.
6:183:13157:15:14:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, the federal minimum wage increased by about 24 percent, rising from $5.85 in
6:184:13247:14:15:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2007  to  $6.55  in  2008  and  then  to  $7.25  in  July,  2009,  which  may  have  priced  a  number
6:185:13349:15:14:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  lower  skill  workers  out  of  the  job  market.   Some  economists  also  point  to  a  number  of
6:186:13453:14:15:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:executive orders signed by President Obama designed to promote the use of union contractors
6:187:13544:15:21:72:294:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on large-scale federal construction projects.
6:188:13589:21:15:89:539:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper analyzes an alternative policy channel that can connect the coincidence be-
6:189:13675:15:14:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tween the severity of housing sector depression and the failure of the labor market to recover.
6:190:13770:14:15:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, Ohanian and Raffo (2011) document that the only OECD countries to expe-
6:191:13856:15:14:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rience severe labor market dysfunction during the Great Recession were also the countries
6:192:13945:14:14:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with  the  most  severe  housing  market  downturns:  Ireland,  Spain,  and  the  U.S.  The  other
6:193:14043:14:15:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:OECD countries had much less employment loss and much less housing sector contraction.
6:194:14129:15:14:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We therefore analyze the impact of mortgage modifications on persistently high levels of U.S.
6:195:14222:14:0:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment.  Mulligan (2009 and 2010) has suggested that these policies distort individ-
7:196:14313:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ual behavior by changing the incentives to take jobs.  We pursue this idea by considering the
7:197:14406:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact of mortgage modifications on location choice.  In particular, by reducing the cost of
7:198:14498:14:15:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:servicing a mortgage, modifications change the incentives to relocate to labor markets with
7:199:14589:15:47:72:198:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:better job opportunities.

7:201:14668:55:14:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This section summarizes mortgage modifications since 2007.  Table 5 provides a national per-
7:202:14760:14:15:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spective on mortgage accounts (90 million accounts by 2010), broad modifications as defined

7:205:15033:15:14:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest  rate,  principal,  or  the  term  of  the  mortgage,  or  more  broadly,  as  any  change  to
7:206:15136:14:15:72:540:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  mortgage  that  increases  or  decreases  the  present  value  of  the  loan  (many  modifications

7:208:15329:14:15:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payment).  This may include an immediate payment in exchange for forgiveness of principal,
7:209:15419:15:14:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as a short sale (a pre-foreclosure sale) and a deed-in-lieu, in which a mortgagor hands
7:210:15511:14:22:72:427:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over collateral property in exchange for a release from all obligations.
7:211:15583:22:14:89:539:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:HOPE NOW estimates that there have been about 14.2 million modifications that satisfy
7:212:15668:14:15:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one of these modification definitions.  Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009) find that roughly
7:213:15761:15:14:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three percent of borrowers 90 days or more in arrears in their sample of mortgages, which
7:214:15850:14:14:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covers roughly 60% of all mortgages through 2008:4, received a narrowly defined modification,
7:215:15943:14:22:72:378:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while eight percent received a broader form of modification.
7:216:16003:22:15:89:539:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Modifications fall into one of two categories, government modification programs developed
7:217:16092:15:14:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by, or associated with, either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal
7:218:16184:14:14:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), or the Home

7:220:16361:15:14:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modifications change the mortgagor’s current payment by changing the mortgage interest
7:221:16447:14:15:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate and/or the time profile of payments, and/or changing the term of the mortgage, and/or
7:222:16537:15:14:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deferring payment of principal or forbearance.  There have been about 1.9 million HAMP
7:223:16623:14:15:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modifications, which accounts for about 17 percent of all permanent modifications, including
7:224:16715:15:14:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the broad definition of modifications, and all other programs account for about 83 percent

7:229:17009:14:15:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment programs feature modifications that reduce payments to either 31 percent or 38 percent
7:230:17100:15:0:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of current income (DTI). This is accomplished by reducing the mortgage payment, subject
8:231:17188:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  a  minimum  interest  rate.   This  minimum  interest  rate  is  operative  for  a  fixed  period,
8:232:17290:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after which the interest rate rises over time.  If the initial interest rate adjustment does not
8:233:17386:14:15:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:satisfy the DTI requirement, then the term of the mortgage is increased, up to a maximum
8:234:17474:15:14:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 40 years.  If these modifications together do not generate the required DTI, then principal
8:235:17568:14:14:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  deferred  to  the  end  of  the  mortgage  as  a  balloon  payment  in  order  to  satisfy  the  DTI
8:236:17672:14:15:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:requirement of the program, and this deferred principal does not accumulate interest.  Some
8:237:17763:15:14:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:programs also provided benefits to borrowers by paying off principal, waiving late fees, and
8:238:17855:14:15:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:re-capitalizing arrears in principal, interest, and taxes.  The median DTI for those receiving
8:239:17949:15:14:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HAMP modifications is about 45 percent of current income when debt only includes mort-
8:240:18035:14:15:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gage  principal,  interest,  homeowners  insurance,  and  property  taxes  (front  end  DTI).  The
8:241:18133:15:14:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:median ”back end” DTI is nearly 80 percent for HAMP modifiers, as this broader measure
8:242:18219:14:15:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of debt includes other mandated payments, including credit card, auto, and other debt, and
8:243:18309:15:21:72:207:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spousal and child support.
8:244:18335:21:15:89:539:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We focus on HAMP modifications since they represent the most frequently used modifi-
8:245:18419:15:14:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cation among the government programs.  Other government programs and non-government
8:246:18502:14:15:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:programs are similar along several dimensions. The main exception is that some programs re-
8:247:18593:15:14:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duce DTI for eligible applicants to 38 percent, rather than HAMP’s 31 percent.  Descriptions

8:252:18976:15:14:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:March of 2009.  The program touted $75 billion for mortgage modifications.  However ac-
8:253:19063:14:14:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cording  to  the  Treasury’s  expense  report,  only  $1  billion  was  spent  through  2010.   There
8:254:19164:14:15:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were several changes to the program on June 1, 2010, but for the sake of space, we will only
8:255:19256:15:22:72:320:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:describe the Pre-June 1, 2010 version of HAMP:
8:256:19302:22:14:89:539:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:A:Eligibility:HAMP eligibility criteria are listed below (loosely quoted from the HAMP
8:257:19386:14:31:72:186:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Servicer Guide, 2009):
8:258:19408:31:23:86:540:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:1.  The mortgage loan is a first lien mortgage loan originated on or before January 1, 2009.
8:259:19500:23:24:86:467:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2.  The mortgage loan has not been previously modified under the HAMP.
8:260:19570:24:23:86:453:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:3.  The mortgage loan is delinquent or default is reasonably foreseeable.
8:261:19643:23:15:86:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:4.  The borrower documents a financial hardship by completing a Home Affordable Modi-
8:262:19728:15:14:101:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:fication Program Hardship Affidavit and provides the required income documentation.
8:263:19811:14:24:101:484:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The documentation supporting income may not be more than 90 days old.
8:264:19880:24:14:86:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:5.  The borrower has a monthly mortgage payment ratio of greater than 31 percent (mort-
8:265:19967:14:0:101:273:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:gage payment over gross income).
9:266:20000:0:15:86:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:6.  A borrower actively involved in a bankruptcy proceeding is eligible for HAMP at the
9:267:20087:15:24:101:204:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:servicer’s discretion.
9:268:20109:24:24:86:438:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:7.  The current unpaid principal balance is no greater than $729,750.
9:269:20178:24:15:86:540:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:8.  The loan must pass a standardized NPV test that compares the NPV result for a mod-
9:270:20264:15:14:101:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:ification to the NPV result for no modification.  If the NPV result for the modification
9:271:20352:14:15:101:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:scenario is greater than the NPV result for no modification, the servicer MUST offer
9:272:20436:15:14:101:540:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:the modification, otherwise the servicer has the option of performing the modification
9:273:20522:14:35:101:184:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:in its discretion.

9:275:20619:14:15:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benefits  count  as  qualified  income.   The  February  2010  report  includes  statistics  on  the
9:276:20719:15:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:main hardship reasons.  Roughly 57% of thepermanentmodifications were for people with
9:277:20804:14:22:72:366:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment problems, including outright unemployment.
9:278:20857:22:31:89:223:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Terms of Modification:
9:279:20879:31:15:86:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:1.  A borrower may be asked to complete a trial period.  The trial period typically lasts 3
9:280:20970:15:14:101:540:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:months.  During this period the bank verifies income and assesses whether the borrower
9:281:21056:14:25:101:249:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:can make the new payments.
9:282:21082:25:14:86:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2.  If a borrower has an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or interest-only mortgage, the
9:283:21168:14:25:101:505:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:existing interest rate will convert to a fixed interest rate, fully amortizing loan.
9:284:21252:25:14:86:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:3.  The following steps outline the process for determining the 31 percent monthly mort-
9:285:21340:14:27:101:203:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:gage payment ratio:
9:286:21359:27:15:106:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(a)  Capitalize accrued interest, out-of-pocket escrow advances to third parties, and
9:287:21444:15:19:127:438:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:any other third party fees that are reasonable and necessary.
9:288:21505:19:15:105:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(b)  Reduce the interest rate.  The interest rate floor in all cases is 2.0 percent.  The
9:289:21594:15:14:127:540:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:reduced rate will be in effect for the first five years followed by annual increases of
9:290:21681:14:15:127:540:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:one percent per year (or such lesser amount as may be needed) until the interest
9:291:21761:15:14:127:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:rate reaches the Interest Rate Cap, at which time it will be fixed for the remaining
9:292:21845:14:19:127:183:225:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:A:loan term.1
9:293:21856:19:15:106:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(c)  If  necessary,  extend  the  term  and  reamortize  the  mortgage  loan  by  up  to  480
9:294:21949:15:19:127:451:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:months to achieve the target monthly mortgage payment ratio.
9:295:22009:19:15:105:539:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(d)  If  necessary,  the  servicer  must  provide  for  principal  forbearance  to  achieve  the
9:296:22105:15:14:127:540:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:target  monthly  mortgage  payment  ratio.   The  principal  forbearance  amount  is
9:297:22189:14:18:127:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:non-interest bearing  and non-amortizing.  The amount  of principal  forbearance

10:300:22431:0:15:127:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:will result in a balloon payment fully due and payable upon the earliest of the

10:303:22636:31:15:89:545:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:A:Performance:By June 1, 2010 there were 398,021 permanent modifications and 1,300,526
10:304:22720:15:14:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trials had been started.  The January 2011 Making Home Affordable report claims that the

10:306:22900:15:14:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modifications started in 2009:4, 81.6% had payment reductions of 20% or more.2Figure 4
10:307:22986:14:14:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:illustrates the redefault rates (which means the loan is again at least 60+ days delinquent)
10:308:23078:14:15:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for a cohort of HAMP permanent modifications.  Annual redefault rates reach 30% even with
10:309:23167:15:14:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sizeable reductions.  Figure 4 also illustrates the redefault rates for government-guaranteed
10:310:23260:14:15:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loans (e.g.  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Insured),  government sponsored enter-

10:315:23609:22:14:89:540:455:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:A:Failed Trials and Rejections:Of those who had their trial period canceled, 44.2%
10:316:23689:14:15:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:received an alternative modification, 5.9% were somewhere in the foreclosure process, and
10:317:23778:15:14:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only 6% were current.3A person who fails a trial is no longer eligible for HAMP; however,
10:318:23867:14:15:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a rejected person may re-apply.  Pre-June 1, 2010, the lack of paperwork necessary led to
10:319:23956:15:42:72:245:397:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:many unsuccessful modifications.4

10:321:24021:29:14:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HOPE  NOW  reports  that  of  the  approximately  4.2  million  permanent  modifications,  3.6
10:322:24115:14:15:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:million were completed independently of HAMP guidelines.  Pre-March 4, 2009, there was
10:323:24201:15:14:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no HAMP criteria and the streamlined modifications were used scarcely.  The Pre-HAMP
10:324:24285:14:15:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification performance is relatively poor.  Very few loans are current (a mere 24%), and
10:325:24375:15:14:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even fewer have actually been foreclosed upon (11% completed, 16% in process).5Table 6

10:327:24547:15:14:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:35-40% and the alternative reductions are also considerably generous around 15-20%.  The
10:328:24635:14:14:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alternative  modifications  were  similar  in  several  respects  to  HAMP,  though  often  focused
10:329:24734:14:15:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on reducing payments to 38 percent DTI for eligible applicants, instead of 31 percent as in

11:337:25218:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:HAMP, and as we will see below, led to higher redefault rates.  Specifically, about 44 percent
11:338:25312:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of canceled HAMP trials obtain an alternative modification and about 30 percent of denied
11:339:25401:14:22:72:306:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applicants obtain an alternative modification.

11:341:25468:21:15:89:539:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  now  describe  the  performance  of  these  modifications  in  terms  of  redefault  rates,
11:342:25563:15:14:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which are defaults on modified mortgages.  Adelino,  Gerardi,  and Willen (2009) find that
11:343:25653:14:15:72:540:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  redefault  rate  for  Pre-HAMP  loans  lies  between  30%  and  50%.   Furthermore,  there
11:344:25748:15:14:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  a  large  fraction  of  loans  (30%)  that  have  a  larger  Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  after  the
11:345:25851:14:15:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification.  They also reported that ‘fewer than 5 % of all of our troubled [90+ days past
11:346:25943:15:21:72:273:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due] borrowers repaid their mortgages.’
11:347:25982:21:15:89:539:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In terms of reallocation, the government is allowing people to maintain their mismatch
11:348:26068:15:14:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the local labor market by providing loan modifications.  Clearly those who could not pay
11:349:26161:14:15:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their mortgages initially are redefaulting.  The process of modifying and then redefaulting is
11:350:26255:15:41:72:361:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:precisely the delay that we focus on in the model below.

11:352:26359:30:14:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  are  unaware  of  studies  that  quantify  the  impact  of  modification  programs  on  unem-
11:353:26456:14:15:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ployment within an optimizing model framework.  There are several related papers including
11:354:26546:15:14:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Mulligan (2010) who considers the implicit marginal tax rates generated by actual guidelines
11:355:26638:14:15:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for FDIC and HAMP modifications.  Mulligan (2009) also discusses the incentive effects of
11:356:26727:15:14:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mortgage modifications on employment, and suggests that modifications have significantly
11:357:26815:14:14:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased unemployment, but he does not provide a quantitative assessment.  Chatterjee and
11:358:26905:14:15:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Eyigungor (2009) consider the HAMP program in a single location DSGE model with en-
11:359:26988:15:14:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dogenous prices, but their model lacks an employment margin and therefore does not allow
11:360:27076:14:15:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for employment incentive effects or relocation.  Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009) argue
11:361:27166:15:14:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  there  are  few  modifications  because  lenders  expect  to  make  more  money  foreclosing
11:362:27264:14:15:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than modifying.  Their conclusion is that preventable foreclosures are rarer than most people
11:363:27357:15:14:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:believe.  The probability of redefault in their sample ranges between 30% and 50% depending
11:364:27448:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the quality of the mortgage and the type of modification.  If a modification uses resources,
11:365:27543:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it may be socially optimal to have few modifications.  Gerardi and Li (2010) provide a useful
11:366:27636:14:22:72:435:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:summary and timeline of the policies that were enacted to save homes.
11:367:27705:22:14:89:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In terms of the link between housing and unemployment,  Oswald (1996) hypothesized
11:368:27787:14:15:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  areas  with  high  homeownership  rates  have  higher  unemployment  rates.   Green  and
11:369:27881:15:14:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Hendershott (2001) use a 1988-1992 PSID panel to track 9000 US household outcomes over
11:370:27967:14:14:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  Among their findings, they present evidence that supports the Oswald hypothesis and
11:371:28057:14:15:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:found significant heterogeneity in the effect of homeownership on unemployment outcomes.
11:372:28145:15:14:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are also studies that have presented evidence against the Oswald Hypothesis.  These
11:373:28234:14:0:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies primarily are based on European data.  Vuuren (2009) studies panel data from the
12:374:28324:0:22:72:454:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Netherlands and rejects a number of predictions of the Oswald hypothesis.
12:375:28397:22:14:89:539:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:DiPasquale  and  Glaeser  (1998)  consider  homeownership  and  mobility  and  argue  that
12:376:28487:14:15:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:homeowners  are  less  mobile.   Studies  based  on  US  data  from  the  recent  recession  include
12:377:28587:15:14:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ferreira, Gyourko, and Tracy (2009), who use a panel from the American Housing Survey to
12:378:28675:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:document that negative equity (which is much more prevalent than modifications) greatly
12:379:28762:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces mobility.  Schulhofer-Wohl (2010) disputes these mobility claims, suggesting that the
12:380:28855:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:empirical methodology of Ferreira, Gyourko, and Tracy is flawed.  Winkler (2011) analyzes
12:381:28944:14:15:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:homeownership and homeowner mobility, and finds that homeownership reduces mobility by
12:382:29030:15:14:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:40 percent and that homeownership also negatively impacts income.6While Winkler does
12:383:29114:14:15:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not consider mortgage modifications, his economic environment is perhaps the closest to ours
12:384:29206:15:47:72:442:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in that he also uses an optimizing model that includes locational choice.

12:386:29297:33:15:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This section presents the model economy we use to assess the impact of mortgage modifica-
12:387:29386:15:14:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion programs on economic activity.  We blend a search model of unemployment with housing
12:388:29475:14:15:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and with the choice of relocating from one local labor market (island) to another island.  To
12:389:29568:15:14:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focus on the relocation effect and to keep the model tractable, we model only the consumer
12:390:29658:14:15:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:side of the economy and treat prices exogenously.  Herkenhoff and Ohanian (2011a) consider
12:391:29748:15:21:72:519:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the employment incentive effect along with the large eviction delays in a related paper.
12:392:29836:21:15:89:539:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Households face a constant probability of death (δ), and maximize the sum of expected
12:393:29921:15:15:72:539:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility  discounted  using  a  fixed  interest  rate  (rh).   With  a  one  month  period,  this  means
12:394:30024:15:8:71:408:347:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:households discount the future using a discount factorβ=(1−δ)

12:396:30094:0:20:417:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:.  They have preferences
12:397:30118:20:14:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over sequences of a nondurable consumption good (c) and a flow of housing services, which
12:398:30207:14:15:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is higher if a household owns a home (zm) rather than rents, (zr).  Mortgages are treated as a
12:399:30301:15:14:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perpetuity.  Thus owning a home requires making a fixed mortgage payment each period (  ̄m).
12:400:30393:14:15:72:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The mortgage payment is tax-deductible.  Renters pay a rental payment (r) each period, but
12:401:30483:15:21:72:252:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this payment is not tax-deductible.
12:402:30518:21:15:89:539:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Households are located on one of two symmetric islands, A or B. They are either employed
12:403:30606:15:14:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(W) or unemployed (U).  Each period, each household receives a wage offer drawn from a
12:404:30692:14:15:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stationary  Markov  chain.   Households  can  either  accept  the  offer  or  reject  the  offer  and
12:405:30793:15:14:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receive unemployment benefits.  The household can also choose to relocate to the alternative
12:406:30885:14:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:island which offers a job finding distribution that stochastically dominates the distribution
12:407:30978:18:16:85:539:172:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:6He  also  finds  that  after  a  labor  shock,  the  homeowner  subgroup  has  an  unemployment  rate  that  is
12:408:31090:16:12:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:6% higher one or more years after the shock as compared to before the shock.  However, renters show no
12:409:31192:12:11:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:significant difference in unemployment rates.  The estimated job offer equation implies that the probability of
12:410:31303:11:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:receiving a job offer from another location is increasing in education (skill in our model).  He also estimates
12:411:31414:12:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the  following  offer  rates:  16%  of  renters  receive  offers  per  period,  13%  of  homeowners  receive  offers  per
12:412:31535:12:0:72:102:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:period.
13:413:31544:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in their current island.  If they relocate, they exit from their home permanently and incur a
13:414:31637:15:21:72:216:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one time utility cost, (MC).
13:415:31665:21:15:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Mortgage modifications are challenging to model as these programs may include many
13:416:31747:15:14:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes  to  the  mortgage  contract,  several  of  which  are  difficult  to  represent  recursively.
13:417:31849:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because mortgages are a perpetuity, all modifications are a temporary reduction in payments
13:418:31940:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is exactly what HAMP and other modification programs do. This temporary reduction
13:419:32027:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can lower payments enough so that people who would otherwise move choose to remain in
13:420:32112:14:15:72:539:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their current location.  We call this change in incentives to relocate therelocation  effectof
13:421:32206:15:22:71:198:580:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:mortgage modifications.7
13:422:32230:22:14:89:539:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In our model, households may request a modification, but one time only, as is the case
13:423:32316:14:14:71:539:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with many modification programs.  A modification in the model works as follows.  As long
13:424:32404:14:15:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  an  agent  has  a  DTI  between  31%  and  75%  (in  the  model  notation  described  below,
13:425:32500:15:14:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:DTI > ̄mwπA> DTI), the agent is eligible for a temporary modification that reduces mortgage
13:426:32591:14:15:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payments as a fraction of their current gross income to 31%.  However, to keep the state space
13:427:32685:15:14:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tractable, the modification term ends with probabilityη.  Since the modification depends on
13:428:32776:14:15:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the mortgagor’s current income, this means-testing of modifications means that the incentives
13:429:32869:15:14:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to relocate in order to sample a better wage distribution are distorted, as the opportunity
13:430:32960:14:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of relocating is higher, reflecting the fact that relocating means losing the modification.
13:431:33056:22:14:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Each agent’s skills evolve over time, and skill evolution depends on employment status,
13:432:33143:14:15:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which is motivated by Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998,  2002).  Specifically,  while employed,
13:433:33234:15:14:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an agent’s skills can increase or decrease, and the probability of increasing their skill level
13:434:33329:14:15:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exceeds  the  probability  of  receiving  a  lower  skill.   For  unemployed  agents,  their  skills  on
13:435:33433:15:14:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average depreciate.  LetπAdenote the skill of an agent on islandA.  The skill transitions
13:436:33522:14:14:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  governed  by  a  Markov  chain  which  is  described  in  Section  4.3.   We  assume  that  the
13:437:33622:14:15:71:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of finding a job increases monotonically with skill.  To capture this,f(πA), which

14:462:35673:15:11:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are weakly monotone in the skill level with a 50% replacement rate and an benefit cap of

14:464:35858:18:14:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adopted because it allows us to formulate the problem recursively while maintaining compu-

21:840:50752:29:14:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  duration  of  unemployment  increases  in  the  modification  economy,  which  is  the  con-
21:841:50849:14:15:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sequence of the lower incentive to relocate.  Specifically, low skill workers and unemployed
21:842:50941:15:14:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mortgagors receive on average large mortgage payment discounts to reduce payments to 31%
21:843:51029:14:15:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of their currrent income.  The modification program thus subsidizes unemployment/low skills
21:844:51120:15:14:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by reducing the opportunity cost of staying in the local labor market.  In the no-modification
21:845:51214:14:15:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:world, there is no such subsidy and as a result the incentive to relocate to the labor market
21:846:51307:15:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with better job prospects is higher.  As a consequence, the modification policies generate 30
21:847:51400:14:15:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:basis points of higher unemployment.  Unemployment is about 50 basis points higher in the
21:848:51489:15:21:72:323:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turbulence experiment, which is described below.
21:849:51537:21:15:89:539:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to the 30 basis point steady state difference in unemployment, the average
21:850:51623:15:14:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duration of unemployment in the modification economy is about one week longer, which is
21:851:51710:14:14:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about a 10 percent increase.  Duration increases because there are more households staying
21:852:51800:14:15:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in local (poor job prospect) labor markets.  By moving, households expect to move up one
21:853:51888:15:14:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:skill level, and this is proportional to their chance of finding a job.  This implication of higher
21:854:51987:14:15:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment duration in the modification economy is consistent with a key fact reported
21:855:52075:15:14:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by Winkler (2011), which is that homeowners have a lower hazard rate out of unemployment
21:856:52163:14:22:72:219:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after an adverse labor shock.
21:857:52192:22:14:89:539:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Mobility falls in the modification economy to a migration rate of about 8 percent per
21:858:52277:14:15:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year, compared to a 10 percent migration rate in the economy without modifications.  This
21:859:52366:15:14:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on mobility is moderate compared to that estimated by Kennan and Walker (2011),
21:860:52452:14:15:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who find that a $10,000 subsidy for moving results in a two percentage point rise in mobility.
21:861:52546:15:14:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In our model, agents receive a 45% reduction in payments on average for 5 years.  Mapping
21:862:52635:14:15:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this  into  the  $6,000  median  annual  reduction  in  payments  observed  in  HAMP  data,  then
21:863:52732:15:14:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is an undiscounted subsidy to modifiers of about $30,000, which is about 1/3 as large
21:864:52823:14:22:72:287:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as that estimated by Kennan and Walker.
21:865:52862:22:14:89:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  also  find  that  the  quarterly  foreclosure  rate  is  about  20  basis  points  lower  in  the
21:866:52963:14:15:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification economy, and the fraction of renters is much lower. The foreclosure rate is higher
21:867:53058:15:14:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the no-modification economy for the same reason that unemployment is lower, which is
21:868:53145:14:14:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because more households leave the local labor market when modifications are unavailable.
21:869:53233:14:15:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While the difference in the foreclosure rates between the two economies is fairly small, there
21:870:53327:15:18:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are large differences in the number of renters.  Because modifications are always available,
21:871:53419:18:0:81:435:108:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:16Recall, there are 7 possible skill slots, so agents are not started in the extremes
22:872:53506:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this quarterly 20 basis point difference generates a much higher steady state mass of renters.
22:873:53600:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, about 48 percent are renters in the non-modification steady state, while about
22:874:53692:14:34:72:353:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:38 percent are renters in the modification steady state.
22:875:53748:34:26:89:532:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To compare our results to those in the literature, we estimated the following equation:

22:881:54217:21:15:89:539:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The estimated results,  which are in Table 10,  are very similar to the empirical results
22:882:54306:15:14:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presented in Haughwout, Okah,and Tracy (2009) who estimate a proportional hazard model
22:883:54392:14:15:72:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the formDt= exp(α(t)) exp(Xγ).  Since their coefficients are in a non-separable expo-
22:884:54480:15:14:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nential form, it is difficult to directly compare the results.  However, they report, that “the
22:885:54575:14:15:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data  indicate  that  a  10  percent  reduction  in  the  required  monthly  mortgage  payment  is
22:886:54673:15:14:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with around a 13 percent reduction in the re-default hazard.”  In our model, if
22:887:54763:14:15:72:539:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payments are reduced by 10% (i.e.κis reduced by .1), then the redefault probability falls by
22:888:54855:15:14:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:11.3% =.1×1.13×100.  This is roughly the same as their empirical results.  Haughwout et

22:890:55034:14:15:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this effect on redefault.  Our estimated equation predicts that a person who has a job at the
22:891:55127:15:14:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:date of requesting a modification is 48% less likely to default one year later as compared
22:892:55217:14:15:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to an unemployed person.  Likewise, an increase in skill, which is a proxy for income, also

22:896:55510:14:15:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:DTI, the reduction in the model would be much larger, as households would tend to wait
22:897:55596:15:14:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to take the modification until their income is very low.  Given that payments are reduced
22:898:55685:14:15:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 31% of current income and a modification can be taken one time only, there is an option
22:899:55775:15:21:72:194:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value to wait to modify.

23:902:55860:30:14:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998, 2002) analyze the impact of labor market policies by conduct-
23:903:55951:14:14:72:540:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing what they refer to as ‘turbulence experiments.’  Specifically, they analyze policies in an
23:904:56045:14:15:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy which has a one-time large, exogenous destruction of jobs, and in which the skill
23:905:56134:15:14:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of the unemployed declines.  We pursue a similar turbulence experiment to analyze the
23:906:56225:14:15:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of mortgage modifications in the model with a one-time, large job destruction
23:907:56315:15:21:72:352:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and a reduction in skills of those who are unemployed.
23:908:56369:21:15:89:539:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f13:A:Specifically,  our  turbulence  experiment  is  as  follows:  (i)  we  double  the  layoff  rate  (2·
23:909:56470:15:14:72:539:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1−pe)) for 1 period, and (ii) for those who are laid off, their skill level is cut by 1 notch
23:910:56564:14:15:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from their initial condition skill level.  The layoff shock and skill shock are unanticipated.  We
23:911:56662:15:14:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simulate a unit mass (approximated by 300,000 individuals) and follow them for 2 years after
23:912:56754:14:15:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the shock, and compare the following variables over time between the modification economy
23:913:56843:15:14:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the non-modification economy:  (a) the unemployment rate, (b) average skill level, (c)
23:914:56933:14:15:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification rate, (d) the redefault rate, and (e) the unemployment survival function.  Mod-
23:915:57025:15:14:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ifications are allowed one time only, and can be applied for from the initial date of the shock
23:916:57120:14:22:72:517:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:until the end of year 2.  The results of this experiment are illustrated in Figures 6 to 9.

23:922:57387:15:14:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economies,  are as follows:  35% begin as renters,  65% begin as mortgagors,  and the intial

23:927:57774:42:30:71:265:242:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:5.4    Turbulence Discussion
23:928:57802:30:14:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The main findings are that modifications raise unemployment, increase the duration of un-
23:929:57891:14:15:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment, reduce the average skill level, reduce worker mobility, and reduce foreclosures.
23:930:57983:15:14:71:539:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, the unemployment rate in the modification economy is about one half percentage
23:931:58075:14:14:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher than in the non-modification economy.  The 0.5 percent difference in unemployment
23:932:58163:14:15:71:539:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is reached after about 10 months, and continues at about that level for the 30 month horizon
23:933:58255:15:14:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we have examined.  While this program does not account for the bulk of the increase in
23:934:58346:14:18:71:539:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current unemployment, it does generate a persistent increase in unemployment, correspond-
23:935:58435:18:0:81:353:108:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:17There are 7 slots in total, and no one begins in the extremes
24:936:58500:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing to about 730,000 unemployed individuals, given the current size of the US labor force.
24:937:58590:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Unemployment duration in the modification economy is about 18.1 weeks, compared to 17.3
24:938:58677:14:22:72:302:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weeks in the economy without modifications.
24:939:58720:22:14:89:539:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The average skill level of the employed in the modification economy is about 0.5 percent
24:940:58808:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower than in the non-modification economy.  Figure 7 illustrates that this difference grows
24:941:58900:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time as the low skilled unemployed modifiers eventually reintegrate back into the work-
24:942:58992:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:force and drag down the average.  It is interesting to note that the modification rate in the
24:943:59085:14:15:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first  year  following  the  job  destruction  shock  is  about  four  percent,  which  is  close  to  the
24:944:59191:15:14:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peak rate of modifications of 4.5 percent in 2009.  The median modifier in this economy has
24:945:59282:14:22:72:459:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a back end DTI of 0.88 as compared to a back end DTI of 0.79 in the data.
24:946:59355:22:14:89:539:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Despite relatively generous modifications, there are a number of redefaults in the modi-
24:947:59443:14:15:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fication economy.  Many of those who lose their job in the turbulence experiment choose to
24:948:59533:15:14:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modify immediately.  Of those who modify, many redefault shortly afterwards.  Specifically,
24:949:59624:14:15:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:41 percent of modifiers redefault within one year,  which is very similar to the 48 percent
24:950:59715:15:14:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate reported by the Office of Thrift Supervision for overall mortgages (OTS 2010-IV, Table
24:951:59806:14:15:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3).   As  in  actual  experience,  many  modifications  are  unsuccessful  from  the  perspective  of
24:952:59907:15:14:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:keeping the mortgagor in their home.  Of those who successfully modify, it is precisely those
24:953:60000:14:15:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with low skill who pay their modified mortgages that create the difference between the two
24:954:60090:15:14:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economies.  These successful modifiers change the speed of recovery by delaying relocation
24:955:60180:14:14:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to better job markets.  Moreover, note that while the redefault rates settle down over time,
24:956:60272:14:15:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is still a persistent flow of new modifications even after the initial shock.  This means
24:957:60367:15:14:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that agents who do not lose their job in the initial period of job destruction do make use the
24:958:60461:14:22:72:196:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:modification afterwards.
24:959:60485:22:14:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These results also have implications for the recent change in the Beveridge curve.  Specif-
24:960:60576:14:15:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically, many economists, including Hall (2010 and 2011) note that the Beveridge curve has
24:961:60665:15:14:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shifted recently such that the efficiency of labor market matching is significantly lower today
24:962:60760:14:15:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than in the past.  While our model does not have a vacancy dimension, it is consistent with
24:963:60851:15:14:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less efficient matching as modified households choose to stay in relatively poor labor markets,
24:964:60946:14:47:72:378:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and thus may be consistent with a shifted Beveridge Curve.
24:965:61004:47:34:72:194:230:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
24:966:61019:34:14:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper has documented the slow recovery of the labor market from the Great Reces-
24:967:61104:14:15:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sion, and has analyzed the impact of mortgage modification programs on why recovery has
24:968:61191:15:14:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been delayed.  These modification programs are means-tested, as the extent that mortgage
24:969:61279:14:15:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payments  are  reduced  by  a  modification  depends  on  a  borrower’s  current  economic  cir-
24:970:61375:15:14:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cumstances, including circumstances in which income is limited to unemployment benefits.
24:971:61463:14:15:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Means-testing thus changes the incentives for workers to relocate from relatively poor labor
24:972:61555:15:0:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets to better labor markets.  Our findings indicate that these policies, as modeled in this
25:973:61652:0:15:72:540:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:version of the paper, can add about 0.5 percent to the unemployment rate, and reduce per
25:974:61740:15:14:72:540:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capita income by about 1 percent, which reflects both lower employment and lower worker
25:975:61827:14:22:72:247:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productivity through skill erosion.
25:976:61862:22:14:89:539:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In  terms  of  understanding  why  unemployment  remains  so  high,  it  appears  that  other
25:977:61955:14:15:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:factors in addition to modifications are impacting current labor markets.  Hall (2011) ana-
25:978:62046:15:14:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lyzes a model in which high real interest rates, combined with labor market rigidities, are
25:979:62137:14:14:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important.  It would be of interest to blend Hall’s world with the modifications presented
25:980:62227:14:15:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:here,  as  well  as  consider  sectoral  issues,  given  that  some  sectors  of  the  economy,  such  as
25:981:62332:15:47:72:296:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing, have been more severely impacted.
