2:22:848:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the economics of employment relationships through theoretical and empirical analysis of
2:23:944:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:an unusual set of firms, large law firms.  Our point of departure is the "property rights" approach that
2:24:1048:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:emphasizes the centrality of ownership's legal rights to control important, non-human assets of the
2:25:1147:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:enterprise.  From this perspective, large law firms are an interesting and potentially important object
2:26:1250:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:of study because the most valuable assets of these firms take the form of knowledge - particularly
2:27:1348:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:knowledge of the needs and interests of clients.  We argue that the two most distinctive organizational
2:28:1451:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:features of large law firms, the use of "up or out" promotion contests and the practice of having winners
2:29:1556:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:become residual claimants in the firm, emerge naturally in this setting.  In addition to explaining otherwise
2:30:1665:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:anomalous features of the up-or-out partnership system, this paper suggests a general framework for
2:31:1764:14:28:72:414:462:12:Times:12:Times:analyzing organizations where assets reside in the brains of employees.

3:45:2198:0:24:267:346:696:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:I. Introduction 
3:46:2214:24:24:107:532:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: In his seminal essay on the theory of the firm, Ronald Coase observed that employment 
3:47:2301:24:14:71:507:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships are difficult to reconcile with conventional notions of economic transactions: 
3:48:2394:14:14:100:103:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
3:49:2394:14:14:107:490:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In economic theory we find that the allocation of factors of production between 
3:50:2474:14:14:107:497:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:different uses is determined by the price mechanism...  Yet in the real world, we 
3:51:2556:14:15:107:510:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find that there are many areas where this does not apply.  If a workman moves from 
3:52:2639:15:14:107:482:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:department Y to department X, he does not go because of a change in relative 
3:53:2716:14:24:107:416:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prices, but because he is ordered to do so (Coase, 1937, p. 387). 
3:54:2782:24:24:107:519:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Coase’s contrast between command relationships and the price mechanism poses two 
3:55:2863:24:24:71:537:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interrelated questions for economic theory.  First, what empowers a firm to effectively command 
3:56:2959:24:24:71:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employees?  Second, does the “command” observed in employment relationships differ from that 
3:57:3052:24:24:71:518:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:found in other commercial transactions?  When an employer tells an employee what to do, is 
3:58:3143:24:24:71:533:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authority exercised in a manner any different than a consumer who tells a retailer what products 
3:59:3240:24:24:71:365:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:she wants the retailer to carry (Alchain and Demsetz, 1972)? 
3:60:3301:24:24:107:518:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Economic theorists from Karl Marx (1967) to Oliver Hart (1989) have suggested that 
3:61:3384:24:24:71:523:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workplace authority derives from a system of property rights that gives the owners of the firm 
3:62:3479:24:24:71:524:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control over the disposition of the non-human capital of the enterprise.  This “property rights” 
3:63:3576:24:24:71:536:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:position is stated most clearly in Sanford Grossman and Hart’s (1986) analysis of investments in 
3:64:3673:24:24:71:506:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“relationship specific assets” and in the subsequent work of Hart and John Moore (1990).  
3:65:3763:24:24:71:518:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Relationship specific assets are assets that achieve their greatest value when used by specific 
3:66:3859:24:24:71:536:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parties.  The important innovation of the Grossman and Hart and Hart and Moore analyses is the 
3:67:3954:24:24:71:527:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demonstration that in dynamic environments, in which enforceable contracts cannot be written 
3:68:4047:24:24:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:covering all contingencies, property rights over relationship-specific assets will affect the ex post 
3:69:4149:24:24:71:538:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution of the surplus, and that this, in turn, requires modifications to the ex ante agreements 
3:70:4251:24:24:71:281:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between parties in economic relationships.  
3:71:4295:24:24:107:511:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This property rights theory provides a simple way to fill the gap in economic theory 
3:72:4380:24:24:71:530:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:identified by Coase.  Employment relationships will appear whenever the expected net benefits 
3:73:4474:24:0:71:501:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:arising from control over physical assets in ex post bargaining exceeds the net benefits of 
4:74:4567:0:24:71:538:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contracting for labor services from a contractor (or consultant) who owns his or her own capital.  
4:75:4666:24:24:71:520:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The employment relationships that emerge in this framework will typically be those in which 
4:76:4758:24:24:71:514:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employers, by virtue of their property rights, exercise greater influence over employees than 
4:77:4852:24:24:71:515:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would otherwise be possible.  Thus employment relationships will be characterized by more 
4:78:4942:24:24:71:402:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“command” than would be observed in other economic transactions. 
4:79:5007:24:24:107:507:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This paper offers an examination of the property rights explanation of employment 
4:80:5089:24:24:71:518:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships and firm organization.  Our approach is to analyze employment relationships in 
4:81:5182:24:24:71:520:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms where ownership is not associated with clear rights to control the disposition of the key 
4:82:5278:24:24:71:533:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assets of the enterprise.  If, as the property rights perspective suggests, control over the assets of 
4:83:5381:24:24:71:507:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the enterprise is important for establishing authority within firms, then the owners of these 
4:84:5475:24:24:71:512:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unusual firms should find it difficult to sustain employment relations found in conventional 
4:85:5568:24:24:71:497:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.  Instead, we would anticipate the emergence within these firms of unconventional 
4:86:5656:24:24:71:541:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:personnel policies—policies the firms can use to sustain employment relationships in the absence 
4:87:5753:24:24:71:260:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clear property rights to key firm assets. 
4:88:5795:24:24:107:529:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The object of our investigation is the organizational structure of large law firms.  These 
4:89:5886:24:24:71:490:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms are typically structured as partnerships.  Attorneys become partners via up-or-out 
4:90:5975:24:24:71:496:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:promotion contests.  In these contests, employers hire attorneys as “associates” for a pre-
4:91:6066:24:24:71:527:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determined time period.  At the end of this time period, associates are either invited to become 
4:92:6163:24:24:71:516:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equity partners—firm owners—or are fired.  The practice of giving firm ownership to senior 
4:93:6254:24:24:71:526:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employees certainly differs from typical firms, and the policy of dismissing associates who are 
4:94:6350:24:24:71:524:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not invited to partnership would seem on the surface to be irrational.  After all, elite law firms 
4:95:6449:24:24:71:517:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:devote substantial resources to recruiting the best legal talent, and the firms’ partners readily 
4:96:6547:24:24:71:538:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:admit many of the associates they fire are talented and able.  Law firms that avoid the expense of 
4:97:6646:24:24:71:527:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firing experienced attorneys and replacing them with inexperienced new hires would appear to 
4:98:6739:24:24:71:276:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enjoy a significant competitive advantage. 
4:99:6782:24:24:107:524:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given its apparent inefficiencies, the survival of the up-or-out system over most of the 
4:100:6871:24:0:71:531:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:past century poses an anomaly for the economics of organizations.  We resolve this anomaly by 
5:101:6966:0:24:71:539:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:arguing that the up-or-out partnership system can be a solution to certain problems created by the 
5:102:7065:24:24:71:282:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:absence of property rights over key assets.   
5:103:7111:24:24:107:541:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our argument can be briefly summarized: Attorneys are “knowledge workers,” who differ 
5:104:7197:24:24:71:531:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from other employees because they essentially carry around key firm assets in their brains.  The 
5:105:7294:24:24:71:536:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:knowledge assets these lawyers control—an understanding of the needs and interests of clients—
5:106:7388:24:24:71:536:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are obviously of greatest value when used with specific clients.  This specificity gives individual 
5:107:7488:24:24:71:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorneys considerable leverage over their employers.  By threatening to “grab and leave” with an 
5:108:7586:24:24:71:527:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important client, attorneys can leverage an increased share of their firm’s revenues.  The up-or-
5:109:7683:24:24:71:542:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out partnership system found in large law firms has evolved over time as a workable resolution to 
5:110:7781:24:24:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this particular problem.  By forming partnerships and firing experienced attorneys who are not 
5:111:7876:24:24:71:526:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:promoted to partnership positions, law firms limit the opportunity for experienced attorneys to 
5:112:7972:24:24:71:535:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grab and leave with the firm’s valuable clients.  Grabbing and leaving is more important in legal 
5:113:8070:24:24:71:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnerships than in conventional firms because law firms cannot readily establish property rights 
5:114:8169:24:24:71:354:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over the knowledge essential for serving particular clients. 
5:115:8230:24:24:107:518:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Previous microeconomic analyses of large law firms focused on up-or-out promotion 
5:116:8312:24:24:71:527:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rules, but have not considered why, in law firms, the winners of the promotion contest become 
5:117:8406:24:24:71:542:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:partners, i.e., residual claimants to the surplus produced by the enterprise (Waldman, 1990; Kahn 
5:118:8504:24:24:71:529:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Humerman, 1988; O’Flagherty and Siou, 1992; Prendergast, 1993).  In our model, both up-
5:119:8595:24:24:71:492:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or-out rules and the partnership structure emerge as a natural solution to the problem of 
5:120:8685:24:24:71:451:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regulating the firm’s knowledge assets in the absence of clear property rights.   
5:121:8767:24:24:107:508:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our theoretical analysis of law firms is related to recent work by Levin and Tadelis 
5:122:8852:24:24:71:529:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2005), who study profit-sharing partnerships.  While the goal of their analysis is different than 
5:123:8951:24:0:71:498:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ours—they study the role of profit-sharing on the selection of heterogenous workers into 
6:124:9041:0:24:71:517:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnerships—their model, like ours, analyzes the impact of an organizational form in which 
6:125:9133:24:24:71:206:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relies on profit sharing.1      
6:126:9165:24:24:107:516:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our work is also related to a series of recent papers by Garicano and Hubbard (2005, 
6:127:9250:24:24:71:527:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forthcoming) that analyze the division of labor within law firms in terms of intra-firm referrals 
6:128:9348:24:24:71:528:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and specialization.  According to this view, specialized attorneys will in general be reluctant to 
6:129:9447:24:24:71:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:refer clients to other specialists who could fruitfully work on part of a client’s legal problem for 
6:130:9548:24:24:71:537:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fear of losing the client’s business entirely.  The sharing of revenues among attorneys within law 
6:131:9647:24:24:71:537:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms mitigates this problem because one specialist can refer the client to another within her own 
6:132:9746:24:24:71:385:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm and still reap benefits from the relationship with the client.   
6:133:9816:24:24:107:518:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis of “grabbing and leaving” is very much complementary to Garicano and 
6:134:9898:24:24:71:485:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hubbard’s in that we also focus on the problem of managing client relationships in an 
6:135:9984:24:24:71:538:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:environment where these relationships cannot be contractually assigned to any individual firm or 
6:136:10081:24:24:71:513:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorney.  Our model seeks to explain an important aspect of large law firms—the up-or-out 
6:137:10172:24:24:71:517:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnership system—from which Garicano and Hubbard abstract.  Conversely, Garicano and 
6:138:10259:24:24:71:542:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hubbard’s work offers a natural explanation for features of large law firms that we take as given.  
6:139:10359:24:24:71:515:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically, the fixed up-front cost of knowledge acquisition by specialists that is central in 
6:140:10456:24:24:71:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Garicano and Hubbard’s model produces precisely the sort of “increasing returns” that our model 
6:141:10552:24:24:71:335:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requires to generate an up-or-out partnership structure. 
6:142:10609:24:24:107:519:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although our focus is on law firms, our theoretical analysis is similar in spirit to such 
6:143:10699:24:24:71:534:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analyses as Stole and Zweibel (1996) and Holmstrom and Milgrom (1996), whose work focuses 
6:144:10789:24:24:71:527:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on intra-firm bargaining to provide perspectives on the internal workings of firms.  As in Stole 
6:145:10886:24:24:71:519:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Zweibel, control over assets determines the outcome of intra-firm bargaining and this, in 
6:146:10980:24:24:71:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:turn, determines organizational structure and pay.  As in Holmstrom and Milgrom, the law firm’s 
6:147:11076:24:45:71:515:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:personnel policies reflect an interconnected system of practices (up-or-out staffing rules and

6:149:11218:24:0:71:480:77:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1  As Levin and Tedelis (2004) note, this line of inquiry extends back to Ward (1958). 
7:150:11306:0:24:71:542:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compensation policies that make senior attorneys the residual claimants).2  Our theoretical results 
7:151:11406:24:24:71:532:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differ from these other studies because law firms rely on a class of assets, knowledge assets, for 
7:152:11505:24:24:71:293:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which it is difficult to enforce property rights. 
7:153:11555:24:24:107:532:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We present the theoretical and empirical arguments of the paper as follows. In section II 
7:154:11645:24:24:71:500:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we set up a simple model of a firm whose net worth is tied to the knowledge of its senior 
7:155:11735:24:24:71:538:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employees.  We demonstrate that an up-or-out partnership system serves as a sensible solution to 
7:156:11832:24:24:71:541:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the organizational dilemma posed by these assets.  In section III we review legal doctrine in order 
7:157:11932:24:24:71:518:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to evaluate the key assumption of the property rights model, namely that contracts regulating 
7:158:12026:24:24:71:527:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lawyer-client relationships are incomplete.  Section IV examines our model in light of relevant 
7:159:12122:24:24:71:531:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:historical evidence on the emergence of the up-or-out partnership system in large corporate law 
7:160:12218:24:24:71:519:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.   Section V provides empirical evidence concerning an implication of our model using 
7:161:12310:24:26:71:469:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:survey data on the time use of attorneys.  Section VI provides concluding remarks. 
7:162:12393:26:24:206:407:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:II. A Model of Law Firm Organization 
7:163:12430:24:24:107:529:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: To set the theoretical arguments we present our model in three stages.  We begin with a 
7:164:12518:24:24:71:533:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:baseline model of a firm with overlapping cohorts of workers who develop firm-specific human 
7:165:12611:24:24:71:509:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital.  In this simplest version of the model a capitalist controls the firm’s key asset (e.g., 
7:166:12709:24:24:71:515:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:physical capital) and can employ workers at a fixed wage; there is no hold-up problem.  The 
7:167:12801:24:24:71:523:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:second variant of our model is motivated by our observation that in a law firm the key asset is 
7:168:12897:24:24:71:531:264:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:knowledge, in the form of working relationships senior attorneys have established with clients.  
7:169:12994:24:24:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although such assets cannot be bought and sold like conventional capital, law firms can preserve 
7:170:13091:24:24:71:538:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the value of assets by organizing themselves as partnerships in which senior attorneys essentially 
7:171:13190:24:24:71:533:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hand off key assets to succeeding generations of junior attorneys.  Finally, in the third variant of 
7:172:13291:24:67:71:523:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our model we address the central issue of grabbing and leaving, and in so doing make our key

7:174:13432:24:0:71:484:77:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2  Rajan and Zingales’ (1998) work on the source of power within firms is also related. 
8:175:13521:0:24:71:532:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:theoretical point—that the professional partnerships formed by attorneys will tend to run “lean” 
8:176:13618:24:24:71:495:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the number of senior partners, and will find it optimal to adopt up-or-out promotions. 
8:177:13708:24:24:144:469:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A. A Conventional Firm with Overlapping Generations of Workers 
8:178:13771:24:24:107:537:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We begin by describing the operation of a conventional firm (not necessarily a law firm), 
8:179:13861:24:24:71:538:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in which an investor controls a durable asset.  The flow from this asset, K, can be combined with 
8:180:13959:24:24:71:516:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor to produce output.  There are two types of labor—experienced and inexperienced.  For 
8:181:14050:24:24:71:524:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clarity of exposition we assume that these two labor inputs are perfectly substitutable, but that 
8:182:14148:24:15:71:530:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experienced workers have higher marginal product than inexperienced workers.  In period t, let 
8:183:14243:15:9:82:87:515:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:0
8:184:14244:9:0:81:432:506:10:g_d0_f4:7:g_d0_f4:tA be labor hired in the current period (i.e., inexperienced workers) andAt
8:185:14319:0:33:430:537:515:7:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1 be labor hired in the 
8:186:14343:33:21:71:512:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:previous period and retained in the current period (i.e., experienced workers).  The value of 
8:187:14437:21:27:71:534:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output produced is),(10KAAFtta+, where a >1.  (As K is fixed we henceforth suppress it as an 
8:188:14530:27:24:71:149:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:argument in F.) 
8:189:14546:24:24:107:516:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Other than the distinction of being experienced or inexperienced, we suppose that all 
8:190:14632:24:24:71:536:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:workers are identical. We assume that the human capital accumulated by experienced workers is 
8:191:14726:24:24:71:528:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm-specific (e.g., it might be specific to a firm’s relationships with its clients).  Workers have

9:273:16603:34:24:107:529:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This outcome is intuitive.  The firm adjusts employment so that the present value of the 
9:274:16692:24:24:71:526:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal product of a worker equals the present value of the reservation wage.  Notice that for 
9:275:16788:24:24:71:506:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(5) to hold, the first expression in parentheses must be negative and the second expression 
9:276:16880:24:24:71:522:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positive.3  In the first period, the marginal product of a worker is below his or her reservation 
9:277:16978:24:24:71:537:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage while, in the second period, marginal product exceeds the reservation wage.  Thus the firm 
9:278:17074:24:24:71:529:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will have no interest in hiring inexperienced workers who would not be retained for the second 
9:279:17169:24:24:71:507:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period, because these workers necessarily cost more than their marginal contribution.  The 
9:280:17260:24:24:71:512:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:profitability of the enterprise indeed depends critically on realizing the surplus produced by 
9:281:17355:24:24:71:532:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experienced employees working together with the firm’s capital.  It is from this perspective that 
9:282:17453:24:40:71:305:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:up-or-out promotion rules appear so anomalous.

9:284:17548:25:16:71:522:90:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3  We know this because (aF1-w) > (F1-w) and these expressions must be opposite signed for 
9:285:17639:16:0:107:213:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equation (5) to equal 0. 
10:286:17665:0:24:107:529:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: To complete our discussion of the firm’s human resource system, we note that there are 
10:287:17752:24:24:71:538:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many values of the wage stream w0 and w1 that satisfy the participation constraint (3).  We might 
10:288:17850:24:24:71:540:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expect the firm to choose wage paths that give neither the firm nor the employee incentive to exit 
10:289:17949:24:24:71:514:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the relationship before the second period, i.e., a wage for which both the firm and employee 
10:290:18042:24:21:71:531:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:receive surplus if the relationship continues.  The result is an upward-sloping wage profile with 
10:291:18140:21:29:101:211:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:ww<0 and wwwa<<1.

10:293:18193:24:24:107:537:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We turn our attention now to law firms specifically.  A central issue with law firms is the 
10:294:18285:24:24:71:512:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control of its key asset—the valuable on-going relationships with clients.  This asset cannot 
10:295:18379:24:24:71:507:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:easily be held by a capitalist.  In particular, as we argue in Section III, when a client has an 
10:296:18476:24:24:71:532:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:established relationship with a particular attorney or group of attorneys, a law firm has no ready 
10:297:18575:24:24:71:519:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism to prevent such attorneys from leaving the firm, taking the client with them.  It is 
10:298:18670:24:24:71:533:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generally recognized that controlling “grabbing and leaving” among attorneys is fundamental to 
10:299:18765:24:24:71:524:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the viability of law firms.4  What has been less generally recognized is the profound effect the 
10:300:18862:24:24:71:523:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:problem of restraining grabbing and leaving can have on firm governance, promotion and pay 
10:301:18953:24:24:71:114:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policies. 
10:302:18963:24:24:107:530:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To examine these issues, consider a large client (say a large corporation) that has a flow 
10:303:19054:24:21:71:512:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of legal needs that require attention each year.  Imagine that this flow, when combined with 
10:304:19147:21:27:71:503:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inexperienced and experienced legal talent, produces value according to)(10ttAAFa+.  If 
10:305:19235:27:24:71:521:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assembling a team of attorneys, A1 and A0, to resolve the client’s legal needs is a value-added 
10:306:19331:24:24:71:527:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activity, an entrepreneur can in principle contract with the client to handle legal needs and hire 
10:307:19430:24:24:71:533:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorneys to provide agreed-upon levels of service.  However, as we just noted, the entrepreneur 
10:308:19527:24:24:71:524:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is vulnerable to a transparent play by its senior attorneys: these attorneys, having established a 
10:309:19626:24:43:71:539:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:valuable relationship with the client, could simply establish a new firm and “take” the client with 
10:310:19726:43:24:251:254:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
10:311:19774:24:0:71:441:77:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4  See, e.g., Gilson and Mnookin (1985), Hillman (1988), and Johnson, 1988. 
11:312:19851:0:24:71:521:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:them.  In this new “partnership” they would hire their own associates, and split the remaining 
11:313:19946:24:24:71:501:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:profit amongst themselves.  This profit would now equal their old wages plus the surplus 
11:314:20035:24:24:71:314:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:previously being generated for the entrepreneur!    
11:315:20087:24:24:107:529:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If the partners in this new enterprise choose to maximize firm profits, they can do so by 
11:316:20177:24:24:71:490:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:paying associates a below-market wage, but then promoting those associates to replace 
11:317:20263:24:24:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:themselves as surplus-generating partners.  The partners now maximize total payout to the senior

11:320:20396:27:24:71:527:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Such an organization is faced with two simultaneous hiring decisions.  The first decision is the 
11:321:20493:24:24:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of attorneys who will be promoted into the partnership in the next period.  The second 
11:322:20587:24:24:71:531:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decision is the number of associates (if any) to hire in excess of the number required to succeed 
11:323:20685:24:24:71:170:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outgoing partners.    
11:324:20707:24:21:107:524:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Attracting talent requires that the firm meet the participation constraint for associates.

11:406:21529:24:24:71:499:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conventional firm, in fact we have precisely the same first-order condition for hiring that 
11:407:21621:24:0:71:503:84:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emerged from the model of a conventional firm (see equation 5 above).  When the firm is 
12:408:21711:0:24:71:505:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:organized as an equity partnership, senior stakeholders essentially “sell” the firm to junior 
12:409:21805:24:24:71:518:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates; associates work at a below-market wage when they are young in exchange for the 
12:410:21896:24:24:71:512:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rights to extract surplus as partners when they are senior.  As in our baseline case, when the 
12:411:21991:24:24:71:536:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnership is profit-maximizing, it will never be profitable to hire associates over and above the 
12:412:22091:24:24:71:443:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number required to assure an adequate number of partners in the next period. 
12:413:22168:24:24:220:393:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C. So Why Up-or-Out Promotions? 
12:414:22200:24:24:107:511:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our key theoretical insight is that while an attorney partnership can be structured to 
12:415:22287:24:24:71:532:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maximize surplus—and in so doing replicate the hiring decisions that a capitalist would make—
12:416:22380:24:24:71:527:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the logic that drives the firm to devolve into a partnership will also induce the firm to adopt an 
12:417:22479:24:24:71:524:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:objective function that does not maximize surplus.  In particular, the problem of grabbing and 
12:418:22574:24:24:71:531:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leaving means that the attorney-owners of our firm must organize themselves so that no sub-set 
12:419:22669:24:24:71:533:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of partners will find it profitable to leave the partnership with the client.  In the absence of other 
12:420:22772:24:24:71:536:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:commitment mechanisms, the partnership can effectively eliminate defection of partners only by 
12:421:22867:24:24:71:534:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:making decisions that maximize surplus per partner rather than total surplus.5  The problem for 
12:422:22963:24:24:71:541:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the senior attorney owners of a partnership, then, is to choose the number of associates and senior

12:433:23823:13:13:107:519:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts controlling the disposition of client relationships.  As we demonstrate below, these 
12:434:23918:13:13:107:518:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts are infeasible to write and enforce.  (Even if such contracts were feasible, it would

13:442:24364:24:24:71:531:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:personnel decisions when the partnership has an “interior solution.”  From (12) we observe that 
13:443:24460:24:21:71:516:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when the organization maximizes per-partner surplus, the value of the marginal product of a

13:445:24653:27:24:71:533:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of partners can profitably form to exclude another partner, as the marginal partner’s value to the 
13:446:24752:24:24:71:508:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm is as large as her share of the firm’s current profits.  Figure 1 illustrates this point: per-
13:447:24851:24:24:71:533:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partner surplus is given by the slope of a ray from the origin through the corresponding point on 
13:448:24949:24:24:71:516:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the production function.  At a partnership size that maximizes per-partner surplus, this slope 
13:449:25044:24:21:71:525:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equals the value of the marginal partner’s product.  From (11) it is apparent that at the optimal

13:452:25329:24:24:107:539:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We have two observations about the partnership’s personnel practices.  First, our analysis 
13:453:25420:24:24:71:535:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicates that partnerships will run lean relative to a conventional profit-maximizing firm: recall 
13:454:25520:24:21:71:534:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that in a conventional baseline case we had total effective employment of attorneys that resulted

13:457:25801:27:24:71:538:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm structure might in some circumstances drive the firm to a “corner solution”—a single senior 
13:458:25898:24:24:71:521:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorney working with an apprentice who takes over the firm when the senior attorney retires. 
13:459:25992:24:24:107:532:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Second, when the nature of the legal services provided requires a team of attorneys (i.e., 
13:460:26083:24:32:71:534:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the scale of production results in an “interior” solution to the firm’s maximization problem), the

13:462:26230:24:16:71:515:90:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:6  The economic logic of our observation that the partnership runs lean is discussed in Ward’s

14:465:26473:21:27:71:517:677:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that in a stable partnership the marginal productivity of any senior attorney in the firm, ,1Fa 
14:466:26568:27:24:71:528:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exceeds that attorney’s earning capacity in the outside market, .w  However, if the partnership 
14:467:26664:24:24:71:541:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:retains “too many” senior partners, the firm will have a situation in which a sub-group of partners 
14:468:26764:24:24:71:533:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can profitably defect from the firm, taking clients with them.  In short, the firm will adopt an up-
14:469:26864:24:24:71:534:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or-out promotion strategy in which perfectly capable associates are not promoted to partnership. 
14:470:26961:24:24:107:517:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A numerical example serves to illustrate our point about the up-or-out organizational 
14:471:27047:24:24:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:structure.  Suppose a large corporate client requires a team of attorneys the value to provide legal

14:478:27601:24:24:71:495:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have argued that such a firm is not viable, though, because of the inability of a capitalist 
14:479:27694:24:24:71:478:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employer to limit grabbing and leaving.  Instead, a partnership utilizing an up-or-out 
14:480:27781:24:24:71:528:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:organizational structure would create legal services (as depicted in (11) and (12)) with 6 senior 
14:481:27879:24:24:71:486:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partners working with 15 junior attorneys, resulting in a steady state promotion rate to

14:488:28423:15:18:107:526:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:show that junior attorneys earn0w= 4/5, while attorneys promoted to partnership earn a profit 
14:489:28517:18:15:107:535:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share of 2 (while those who do not win promotion earn the opportunity wage1w= 1 elsewhere).  
14:490:28610:15:13:107:507:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The extraordinarily high partner compensation deters grabbing and leaving.  It is common 
14:491:28699:13:13:107:539:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:practice in large law firms to provide extra compensation to “rainmakers”—senior attorneys who 
14:492:28794:13:13:107:535:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are especially effective in bringing in new clients.  Our model abstracts from such heterogeneity 
14:493:28892:13:0:107:527:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in productivity.  But the logic of our model does suggest why such compensation is necessary: 
15:494:28988:0:24:107:498:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: We draw attention to one final feature of our model.  In a conventional setting an 
15:495:29071:24:24:71:521:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exogenous shift that increases the value of workers’ marginal product (e.g., an increase in the 
15:496:29167:24:24:71:517:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:output price) induces the firm to increase employment.  Matters are more complicated in our 
15:497:29259:24:19:71:531:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model.  Consider again the numerical example (13), but increaseq from 108 to 112.  Given the 
15:498:29352:19:31:71:496:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:first-order condition (11), we can we sure that indeed effective employment,,10AAa+  
15:499:29437:31:24:71:538:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases.  However, given the relationship between the marginal product of senior attorneys and 
15:500:29534:24:24:71:534:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the per-partner surplus (12), the increase in the firm’s profitability means that the viable number 
15:501:29634:24:24:71:506:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of partners decreases; in our example, in the optimal steady state there is a decrease in the 
15:502:29728:24:24:71:533:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of senior partners from 6 to 4 while the employment of junior associates increases from 
15:503:29823:24:24:71:449:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:15 to 20; the steady state promotion rate to partnership declines to 20 percent.  
15:504:29905:24:24:268:345:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:D. Implications 
15:505:29921:24:24:107:500:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:Where will the up-or-out system be found?  Our model suggests that an up-or-out 
15:506:30001:24:24:71:504:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnership system is likely to emerge as a response to the threat of grabbing and leaving.  
15:507:30094:24:24:71:541:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:According to the reasoning we have laid out, this organizational form is likely to appear when (1) 
15:508:30193:24:24:71:524:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the firm’s key “asset” is on-going long-term relationships with clients,8 and (2) large teams of 
15:509:30290:24:24:71:500:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorneys are needed to satisfy complex and varied needs of clients.9  We also notice that 
15:510:30381:24:41:71:527:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:according to our theory, the higher the value of the legal services the more “severe” will be the 
15:511:30479:41:13:575:578:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                             
15:512:30635:13:13:107:530:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:senior attorneys must be well paid, and this logic will be especially pertinent to those attorneys 
15:513:30734:13:24:107:304:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who are at risk to grabbing and leaving.        
15:514:30782:24:16:71:529:221:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:8  The long-term relationship might most obviously be continued legal advice offered a corporate 
15:515:30879:16:13:107:522:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:client or a wealthy family with succeeding generations of individuals receiving advice from a 
15:516:30973:13:13:107:538:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trusted firm.  As emphasized in Bar-Isaac (2003), the long-term relationship might also be with a 
15:517:31071:13:13:107:499:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:community in which the firm has an established reputation (though this obviously is not 
15:518:31159:13:24:107:233:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:something we model here).  
15:519:31186:24:16:71:507:142:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:9  Specifically, our model requires that the scale of legal production is such that the services 
15:520:31283:16:13:107:537:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:required by large corporate clients could not be provided by a network of small firms having one 
15:521:31380:13:13:107:511:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:senior partner and one junior associate (who anticipates inheriting the firm from the senior 
15:522:31473:13:13:107:532:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:partner the next period).  If, in fact, the work flow could be so divided, the client could utilize a 
15:523:31575:13:13:107:525:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:network of small firms that would maximize surplus.  In our initial numerical example, such a 
15:524:31669:13:0:107:460:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:network would allocate 1/16 of the work flow to each of 16 two-person firms.   
16:525:31750:0:24:71:525:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:up-or-out system, i.e., the higher will be the fraction of junior attorneys who will be dismissed 
16:526:31848:24:24:71:250:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:rather than promoted to partnership.  
16:527:31886:24:24:107:519:650:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:Client Contact.  Our model treats the length of the associate period as exogenous; we 
16:528:31972:24:24:71:521:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assume that senior law partners can grab and leave, while junior attorneys cannot.  One could 
16:529:32066:24:24:71:532:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imagine a theoretical treatment that did not rely on so stark an assumption, but instead analyzed 
16:530:32164:24:24:71:514:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the dynamic process whereby firms allocate the time of young attorneys to client contact.  If 
16:531:32258:24:24:71:530:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:controlling the firm’s key asset—the relationship with clients—is central to the firm, we would 
16:532:32354:24:24:71:497:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expect the firm to take other actions to limit the ability of young attorneys from building 
16:533:32446:24:24:71:539:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships that would allow them to “grab and leave.”  Thus a more complete treatment would 
16:534:32541:24:24:71:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:solve for the optimal length of an “associateship” by comparing the benefits of more experienced 
16:535:32638:24:24:71:524:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates (higher levels of productivity, reducing the burden of fixed hiring costs) against the 
16:536:32736:24:24:71:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs (an increased likelihood that the associate will be able to defect with the client).  All else 
16:537:32837:24:24:71:532:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equal, if firms could reduce the likelihood of client defection they would no doubt prefer longer 
16:538:32935:24:24:71:531:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associate periods.  One way to realize some of the benefits of longer associateships would be to 
16:539:33032:24:24:71:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduce the direct contact between clients and associates.  In the absence of such contacts it would 
16:540:33132:24:24:71:531:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be difficult for associates to develop the kind of rapport with clients required to make the threat 
16:541:33232:24:24:71:533:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of grabbing and leaving credible.  A natural implication of our model’s logic, then, is that client 
16:542:33332:24:24:71:535:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contact for associates will be reduced in the large firms that rely heavily on up-or-out promotion 
16:543:33431:24:26:71:100:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rules. 
16:544:33438:26:24:226:388:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:III. Are Contracts Incomplete? 
16:545:33469:24:24:107:532:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The property rights explanation of up-or-out employment relationships requires that law 
16:546:33557:24:24:71:524:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms cannot rely upon other, less costly means of restraining grabbing and leaving.  The most 
16:547:33652:24:24:71:542:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:straightforward means of preventing grabbing and leaving is to write contracts that bind the client 
16:548:33752:24:24:71:477:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the law firm.  The status of these contracts is determined by codes of professional 
16:549:33839:24:24:71:532:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responsibility.  These codes may vary from state to state, but they are strongly influenced by the 
16:550:33938:24:0:71:529:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model codes put forward by the American Bar Association (ABA).  The ABA promulgated the 
17:551:34028:0:24:71:534:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cannons of Professional Ethics in 1908, the Model Code of Professional Responsibility in 1967 
17:552:34122:24:24:71:542:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct in 1983.  These codes prohibit contracts that limit a 
17:553:34220:24:26:71:256:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:client's freedom to choose her lawyer: 
17:554:34259:26:14:107:498:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because the lawyer-client relationship is personal in nature and dependent on the 
17:555:34341:14:14:107:487:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:client's trust in the lawyer, both the Model Code and the Model Rules mandate 
17:556:34419:14:14:107:477:596:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lawyer withdrawal upon discharge by a client.  For purposes of grabbing, the 
17:557:34496:14:14:107:494:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:client's power to choose, discharge, or replace a lawyer borders on the absolute.  
17:558:34579:14:15:107:500:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Even a contract purporting to bind the client to a lawyer or a firm is terminable at 
17:559:34664:15:36:107:290:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the will of the client (Hillman, 1988). 
17:560:34704:36:24:107:527:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For similar reasons the rules of legal ethics bar the use of non-compete agreements in a 
17:561:34793:24:24:71:538:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:law firm's employment contract with associates.10  The reasoning for the proscription is based in 
17:562:34891:24:24:71:522:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:part on the rejection of the idea that client relationships are the property of the attorneys.  The 
17:563:34991:24:24:71:519:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:following assessment of a 1961 statement by the ABA's Committee on Professional Ethics is 
17:564:35081:24:24:71:524:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:revealing in this point: “The committee’s Formal Opinion 300 notes that attorneys can neither 
17:565:35175:24:24:71:537:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:buy nor sell clients, adding that a restrictive covenant represents an attempt to ‘barter in clients’”

17:569:35488:24:24:71:488:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:improper third-party interference with attorney client relations is actionable as tortious

17:572:35724:24:16:71:537:221:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10  See, e.g., Hillman (1988) and Johnson (1988).  Johnson notes, “Rule 5.6 of the Model rules state 
17:573:35825:16:13:107:525:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in part: ‘A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: (a) a partnership or employment 
17:574:35921:13:13:107:539:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agreement that restricts the rights of the a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, 
17:575:36024:13:13:107:507:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement.’  This language is substantially 
17:576:36114:13:24:107:420:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identical to that included in the Model Code” (Johnson, 1988, p. 125). 
17:577:36185:24:16:71:526:142:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:11  Accountants and physicians regularly enter into non-compete agreements.  However, the legal 
17:578:36281:16:13:107:492:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:status of these agreements is different from other contracts.  Judges can disallow those 
17:579:36370:13:13:107:484:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agreements (or the parts of the agreements) that do not pass a “reasonableness” test.  
17:580:36457:13:13:107:506:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Reasonableness is generally interpreted as restricting the time period and geographic area 
17:581:36548:13:13:107:536:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:covered by the agreement as well as the employers  “need” for protection from competition with 
17:582:36643:13:0:107:338:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the employee (see Callahan, 1985 and Sterk, 1993). 
18:583:36696:0:24:71:502:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recognized ethical codes is important in determining whether interference with plaintiffs’ 
18:584:36787:24:24:71:243:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contractual relations was improper. 
18:585:36823:24:24:107:531:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Model Code and the Model Rule prohibit certain kinds of solicitation by attorneys.  
18:586:36911:24:24:71:506:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These prohibitions, however, do not create a substantial barrier to associates who consider 
18:587:37003:24:24:71:493:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grabbing and leaving.  Rule 7.3 of the Model Rules states that a “lawyer may not solicit 
18:588:37092:24:24:71:535:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:professional employment from a prospective client with whom the lawyer has no family or prior

18:590:37281:24:24:71:477:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lawyer's doing so is the lawyer’s pecuniary gain” (Hillman, 1988, p. 13).  The “prior 
18:591:37367:24:24:71:507:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationship” qualification would seem to allow most solicitation of clients with whom the 
18:592:37458:24:24:71:235:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:departing associate has contact.12 
18:593:37492:24:24:107:533:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Another basis for litigation is the law of agency.  Associates are the agents of their firms 
18:594:37585:24:24:71:537:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and agents are prohibited from stealing “trade secrets.”  If in the course of his work, however, an 
18:595:37685:24:24:71:513:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employee acquires useful information about clients or business methods, this information is 
18:596:37777:24:24:71:531:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:barred from use in subsequent competition only to the extent that use of this information would 
18:597:37873:24:24:71:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be unfair to the former employer (Hillman, 1988, and Johnson, 1988).  The “unfairness” standard 
18:598:37969:24:24:71:532:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is difficult to apply in the context of grabbing by lawyers because it is likely to conflict with the 
18:599:38071:24:24:71:210:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:principle of client choice.13  
18:600:38102:24:24:107:500:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A recent and comprehensive review of the law regarding solicitation of clients by 
18:601:38184:24:24:71:541:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:departing associates and partners concluded that from a legal perspective, “... there is little a firm 
18:602:38287:24:24:71:515:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can do to protect itself from the loss of clients to departing partners or associates” (Johnson, 
18:603:38384:24:24:71:511:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1988, p.133).  Even in cases where legal recourse is possible, law firms may be reluctant to 
18:604:38477:24:27:71:378:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:litigate for fear of souring relations with the client in the future. 
18:605:38547:27:24:251:254:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
18:606:38595:24:16:71:528:143:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:12  In light of the results reported below, it is worth noting that this qualification gives law firms a 
18:607:38700:16:24:107:459:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:direct interest in reducing the degree of contact between associates and clients. 
18:608:38782:24:16:71:519:103:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:13  As Hillman suggests, “In light of the importance accorded client choice under ethical norms, 
18:609:38879:16:13:107:527:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considerations emphasizing fairness to the firm are not dispositive of the issues raised by post  
18:610:38977:13:0:107:261:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:withdrawal competition” (p. 172).

19:612:39075:36:24:107:541:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The property rights approach suggests that up-or-out partnership systems should evolve in 
19:613:39165:24:24:71:534:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large firms—particularly those firms characterized by: (1) valuable long-term relationships with 
19:614:39262:24:24:71:513:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients and (2) legal services complex enough that they require the simultaneous efforts of a 
19:615:39356:24:24:71:517:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number of experienced attorneys.  In what follows, we investigate this proposition by briefly 
19:616:39450:24:24:71:506:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reviewing the historical emergence of the up-or-out system in large corporate law firms.14 
19:617:39540:24:24:107:534:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Prior to the appearance of large law firms, the career of an attorney was characterized by 
19:618:39631:24:24:71:509:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“fluid partnerships.”  Attorneys would move easily from one partnership to another—often 
19:619:39720:24:24:71:498:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:taking clients with them (Galanter and Palay, 1991, p. 14).  Organizations that we would 
19:620:39809:24:24:71:532:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recognize today as large law firms appeared early in this century to provide legal services to the 
19:621:39908:24:24:71:536:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:newly emerging, large corporations.  Consistent with our model, these corporate clients required 
19:622:40005:24:24:71:516:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:new kinds of complex legal services which “could be supplied only by a team of specialized 
19:623:40096:24:24:71:498:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lawyers” (Galanter and Palay, 1991, p. 5).15  Given the amount of business generated by 
19:624:40184:24:24:71:513:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual corporate clients, a major concern of the early progenitors of large law firms was 
19:625:40278:24:24:71:509:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:establishing a lasting relationship between the corporate client and the law firm rather than 
19:626:40372:24:24:71:292:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between the client and an individual attorney. 
19:627:40419:24:24:107:522:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The career of Paul D. Cravath, one of the central innovators in the development of the 
19:628:40506:24:24:71:536:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:modern corporate law firm, highlighted the possibility that young attorneys could grab and leave 
19:629:40603:24:24:71:539:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with clients.  Early in his career Cravath split off from an established law firm and took with him 
19:630:40703:24:47:71:521:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the business of the Westinghouse interests.  With this client, he moved to the firm of Seward,

19:632:40846:24:27:71:498:169:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:14  This discussion relies on Galanter and Palay (1991), Hobson (1986) and Abbott (1988). 
19:633:40936:27:16:71:522:142:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:15  In his review of the historical development of the American legal profession, Andrew Abbott 
19:634:41032:16:13:107:521:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states that the growth of large commercial enterprises “involved some problems never before 
19:635:41124:13:13:107:525:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:encountered—large-scale reorganizations, massive bond issues, tax planning and, in America, 
19:636:41216:13:13:107:541:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:antitrust” (Abbott, 1988, p. 248).  Abbott (p. 252) also claims that the newly introduced large law 
19:637:41316:13:13:107:522:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firms allowed for a high degree of specialization whose effect was a dramatic increase in law 
19:638:41410:13:0:107:185:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firm productivity 
20:639:41430:0:24:71:535:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Gurthie and Steele and began to introduce the set of personnel policies that came to characterize 
20:640:41528:24:24:71:409:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:most large, corporate law firms by the 1920’s (Hobson, 1986, p. 197). 
20:641:41598:24:24:107:520:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The system of law firm management introduced by Cravath involved three distinctive 
20:642:41681:24:24:71:491:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:personnel policies that were a sharp break from past practice.  First, the firm hired only 
20:643:41772:24:24:71:542:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inexperienced law school graduates to work as associates.16  Second, the law firm paid associates 
20:644:41870:24:24:71:530:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:salaries instead of allowing them to cultivate their own clients.  For example, prior to Cravath's 
20:645:41969:24:24:71:521:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:arrival at Seward, Guthrie and Steele, the firm had been “staffed by friends of the partners, of 
20:646:42066:24:24:71:524:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:colleagues at the bar and of clients, and most of them stayed only a few months...  These men 
20:647:42160:24:24:71:543:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:had not been paid and had been allowed to seek clients of their own” (Hobson, 1986, p.197-198).  
20:648:42257:24:24:71:538:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, the associates working in Cravath's system were offered training and the opportunity to be 
20:649:42355:24:24:71:502:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:considered for partnership.  Those associates who were not promoted were helped to find 
20:650:42443:24:24:71:188:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positions at other firms. 
20:651:42469:24:24:107:535:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Associates in the new law firms were given little opportunity to establish an independent 
20:652:42559:24:26:71:275:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reputation or relationships with clients:17  
20:653:42604:26:14:107:497:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“Thus, by the late 1890’s and early 1900’s, Cravath was creating a system of law 
20:654:42685:14:14:107:484:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:office organization which would, when it became a general rule in the 1920’s, 
20:655:42763:14:14:107:468:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make nearly impossible the kind of career he and his young colleagues had 
20:656:42837:14:14:107:481:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:known.  They had established major reputations as young men.  For example, 
20:657:42912:14:15:107:472:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Hughes was only twenty-six and Cravath twenty-five when they were made 
20:658:42983:15:14:107:492:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partners in Carter's firm in 1888.  These men had been able to move easily from 
20:659:43063:14:14:107:492:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm to firm, often creating new firms themselves and carrying their clients with 
20:660:43145:14:14:107:488:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:them.  In addition they often became known by the public, sometimes because, 
20:661:43222:14:14:107:493:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:like Hughes, they were active in court practice, sometimes because they became 
20:662:43301:14:14:107:468:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:involved in urban, state, or national politics.  But the Cravath system, once 
20:663:43379:14:15:107:491:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutionalized, churned out anonymous organization men, steadfastly loyal to 
20:664:43459:15:24:107:475:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the firm that had hired them fresh out of law school, moving only if the firm

20:666:43585:24:16:71:526:156:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:16  Currently, law school graduation is the primary pre-requisite for a career in law.  This was not 
20:667:43686:16:13:107:537:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:true at the turn of the century.  Estimates are that only one quarter of those admitted to the bar in 
20:668:43788:13:13:107:528:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1870 were law school graduates, compared to two thirds in 1910 (Galanter and Palay, 1991, p. 
20:669:43881:13:13:107:515:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:9).  For a discussion of the causes and consequences of the emergence of law schools in the

21:672:44105:0:14:107:489:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:informed them it could not advance them to partnership” (cited in Galanter and 
21:673:44184:14:26:107:273:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Palay from Hobson, 1986 p. 200). 
21:674:44217:26:36:140:474:668:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:V. Contact between Associates and Partners in Large Law Firms 
21:675:44279:36:24:107:511:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If our property rights perspective is correct, up-or-out personnel policies discourage 
21:676:44366:24:24:71:530:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grabbing and leaving by dismissing associates before they have established strong relationships 
21:677:44462:24:24:71:527:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with clients.  The length of the associate period can therefore be increased (and the unit cost of 
21:678:44561:24:24:71:524:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hiring associates be reduced) if firms limit the direct contacts between clients and associates.   
21:679:44660:24:24:71:503:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Indeed, if it were possible to completely eliminate contact between clients and associates, 
21:680:44752:24:24:71:277:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates could be employed indefinitely. 
21:681:44795:24:24:107:541:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Limiting client-associate contacts was a clear concern for the founders of large, corporate, 
21:682:44888:24:24:71:527:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:law firms. In modern firms, such contact is still believed to increase the likelihood of grabbing 
21:683:44986:24:26:71:133:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and leaving: 
21:684:44999:26:14:107:490:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One practice which undoubtedly exacerbates the risk of departure-based loss of 
21:685:45078:14:15:107:476:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients is that of over-delegation of responsibility to junior attorneys.  To the 
21:686:45160:15:14:107:502:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extent that senior attorneys fail to maintain client contact or to supervise the work 
21:687:45246:14:14:107:491:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of subordinates, it is not surprising that junior attorneys should regard clients as 
21:688:45331:14:14:107:476:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their own or that clients should feel a special bond to those junior attorneys.  
21:689:45412:14:14:107:489:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Accordingly, senior attorneys often might be well advised to maintain a greater 
21:690:45492:14:36:107:469:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:degree of participation in the affairs of firm clients (Johnson, 1988, p.135). 
21:691:45571:36:24:107:526:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We should expect, therefore, that the firms should develop a division of labor in which 
21:692:45659:24:24:71:530:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partners have more contact with clients than associates.  Since, as we have discussed, the up-or-
21:693:45756:24:24:71:524:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out system is relied upon most heavily in large firms, we would expect the difference in direct 
21:694:45852:24:24:71:391:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contact between partners and associates to increase with firm size. 
21:695:45920:24:24:107:525:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In 1984, the Young Lawyer’s Division of the American Bar Association conducted the 
21:696:46003:24:24:71:538:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:first nationally representative survey of lawyers (for a description see American Bar Association,

21:699:46237:24:16:71:524:90:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:18  The survey consisted of a random probability sample of 3,000 lawyers of all ages drawn from 
21:700:46333:16:0:107:521:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:both ABA member and nonmember lists totaling 586, 706 lawyers.  The sampled individuals 
22:701:46423:0:24:71:502:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates and partners use their time.  Most important for our purposes, the survey asked 
22:702:46514:24:24:71:510:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorneys what fraction of their time over the previous 12 months was spent in contact with 
22:703:46606:24:24:71:533:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients and in new client development.  Table 1 presents data on client contact and development 
22:704:46702:24:24:71:477:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for attorneys in private practice.  Solo practitioners were not included in the sample. 
22:705:46790:24:24:107:525:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 presents data on the percent of time attorneys in law firms 
22:706:46877:24:24:71:509:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spend in contact with clients.  It is clear from this table that associates spend less time with 
22:707:46974:24:24:71:503:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients than do partners.  Consistent with our model, the differences between partners and 
22:708:47065:24:24:71:520:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates increase with firm size.  In the largest firm size category of 90+ attorneys, partners 
22:709:47163:24:24:71:509:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spend 80 percent more time with clients than do associates.  In firms with 4-9 lawyers, this 
22:710:47256:24:24:71:231:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differential is roughly 8 percent.  
22:711:47292:24:24:107:538:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:If grabbing and leaving is a problem, large firms should worry more about some forms of 
22:712:47380:24:24:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:client contact than others.  In particular, firms should discourage associates from developing new 
22:713:47479:24:24:71:520:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients of their own.  Columns 3 and 4 of Table 1 compare the fraction of time associates and 
22:714:47573:24:24:71:511:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partners spend in client development.  Partners spend more time developing clients than do 
22:715:47664:24:24:71:534:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates and, as before, this difference increases with the size of the firm.  In the largest firms, 
22:716:47767:24:24:71:520:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partners spend 120% more time in client development than do associates.  For firms with 4-9 
22:717:47859:24:24:71:271:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lawyers, the comparable figure is 60%.19 
22:718:47899:24:24:107:532:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 2 presents the data in Table 1 in an OLS regression framework.  The advantage of 
22:719:47986:24:24:71:535:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this way of analyzing the data is that it allows us to assess the role that differences in experience 
22:720:48088:24:37:71:517:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or practice style have on client contact.  Column 1 of Table 2 estimates the natural log of the 
22:721:48184:37:13:575:578:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                             
22:722:48340:13:13:107:505:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were sent a lengthy survey covering many aspects of their work environment, job history, 
22:723:48429:13:13:107:535:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:educational background health and psychological profile and basic demographics.  All members 
22:724:48522:13:13:107:515:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the study sample were sent a copy of the questionnaire.  After several weeks of returns, a 
22:725:48616:13:13:107:537:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:follow-up post card was mailed to all non-respondents.  Seven weeks into the survey a telephone 
22:726:48712:13:13:107:522:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:follow-up was begun.  A total of 76.9% responded to a combination of the mailed survey and 
22:727:48803:13:24:107:206:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:telephone follow-ups. 
22:728:48825:24:16:71:520:103:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:19  The finding that associates in large firms spend relatively little time on client development is 
22:729:48926:16:13:107:540:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consistent with other evidence that client development is not an especially important criterion for 
22:730:49026:13:0:107:410:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:promotion in large law firms (Landers, Rebitzer and Taylor, 1996).  
23:731:49096:0:24:71:539:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:percent of work time devoted to client contact as a linear function of associate status (Associate), 
23:732:49197:24:24:71:535:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the log of firm size (Log of Firm Size), and an interaction between associate status and firm size 
23:733:49296:24:24:71:219:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Associate*Log of Firm Size). 
23:734:49326:24:24:107:522:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The estimated difference between the amount of time partners and associates spend in 
23:735:49411:24:24:71:515:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contact with clients is captured by Associate and Associate*Log of Firm Size.  The negative 
23:736:49503:24:24:71:532:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:coefficients on these variables indicate that associates spend less time with clients than partners 
23:737:49603:24:24:71:314:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and that the differences increase with firm size.20  
23:738:49656:24:24:107:522:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In column 2 of Table 2 we re-estimate the client contact time equation with additional 
23:739:49743:24:24:71:501:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables controlling for experience (Years Since Bar Exam), job tenure (Years At Firm), 
23:740:49832:24:24:71:529:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:geographic location (Live In Legal Center), type of practice (e.g., corporate law, administrative 
23:741:49930:24:24:71:535:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:law, property law, family law, etc.).  In addition, we include a vector of human capital variables: 
23:742:50030:24:24:71:539:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorney’s assessment of the prestige of their undergraduate institution (a four point scale ranging 
23:743:50131:24:24:71:483:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from “not at all prestigious” to “very prestigious”); variables indicating the attorney’s 
23:744:50221:24:24:71:519:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:undergraduate major (biological sciences, physical sciences and engineering, social sciences, 
23:745:50315:24:24:71:523:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:humanities, business and other); and the attorney’s report of their quartile ranking in their law 
23:746:50413:24:24:71:539:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:school class.  Finally, we include dummy variables indicating gender and race (because attorneys 
23:747:50510:24:24:71:519:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in this sample were overwhelmingly white, we rely simply on a dummy variable equal to 1 if 
23:748:50601:24:24:71:534:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:respondent was not white).  Introducing these additional control variables has virtually no effect 
23:749:50700:24:24:71:541:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the results reported in column 1.  This suggests that differences by firm size between associate 
23:750:50800:24:24:71:532:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and partner client contact are not due to differences in experience, type of legal practice, human 
23:751:50899:24:24:71:290:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital acquisition or attorney demographics. 
23:752:50945:24:24:107:542:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Column 3 of Table 2 contains parameter estimates of a client development time equation.  
23:753:51034:24:43:71:523:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The equation in column 3 is identical to that presented in column 1, except that the dependent 
23:754:51129:43:24:251:254:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
23:755:51177:24:16:71:532:103:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:20  A test of the hypothesis that both the coefficients on Associate and Associate*Log of Firm Size 
23:756:51277:16:13:107:524:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are zero yields F(2,813) = 15.68.  A test of the hypothesis that, at the mean firm size, the total 
23:757:51376:13:0:107:354:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect of associate status is zero yields F(1,813) = 23.2. 
24:758:51437:0:24:71:505:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variable is the natural log of the percent of time spent in client development. The negative 
24:759:51530:24:24:71:504:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:coefficients on Associate and Associate*Log of Firm Size indicate that associates spend a 
24:760:51620:24:24:71:537:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:smaller fraction of their work time on client development than partners and that the difference in 
24:761:51719:24:24:71:306:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time allocation increases with size of the firm.21 
24:762:51769:24:24:107:531:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Column 4 of Table 2 re-estimates the equation in Column 3 of Table 2 after introducing 
24:763:51856:24:24:71:508:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables controlling for attorney experience, job tenure, place of practice and type of legal 
24:764:51951:24:24:71:535:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:practice.  The key results are unaffected by these additional variables, suggesting the differences 
24:765:52051:24:24:71:530:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in these factors across firm size cannot account for the differences in associate and partner time 
24:766:52150:24:24:71:93:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:use. 
24:767:52155:24:24:107:518:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Three fundamental results emerge from the data presented in Tables 1 and 2.  First, it 
24:768:52242:24:24:71:519:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:does not appear possible to completely separate associates and clients.  Associates in all firm 
24:769:52338:24:24:71:541:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sizes spend some of their work time in contact with clients or in developing new clients.  Second, 
24:770:52437:24:24:71:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates spend less time with clients than do partners.  Third, this divergence between associate 
24:771:52537:24:24:71:517:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and partner time use increases with the size of firm.  Importantly, these results are not due to 
24:772:52634:24:24:71:414:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differences in experience and type of practice across firm size groups.   
24:773:52708:24:24:107:537:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Table 3, we present analysis of other dimensions of time use by estimating regressions 
24:774:52798:24:24:71:526:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:similar to those in columns (2) and (4) of Table 2 for other activities.  To economize on space, 
24:775:52895:24:24:71:542:290:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:we suppress all coefficients but those on our key variable of interest, ASSOCIATE*LOG FIRM SIZE.  
24:776:52993:24:35:71:524:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each row of Table 3 corresponds to a distinct time-use regression with the dependent variable 
24:777:53087:35:24:251:254:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
24:778:53135:24:16:71:524:207:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:21  A test of the hypothesis that Associate and Associate*Log of Firm Size are jointly zero yields 
24:779:53234:16:13:107:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:F(2,813) = 26.13.  A test of the hypothesis that, at the mean firm size, the total effect of associate 
24:780:53337:13:13:107:517:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:status is zero yields F(1,813) = 43.36.  As for the magnitudes involved, using the interaction 
24:781:53432:13:13:107:538:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficient from Column (1) of Table 2, we can draw the following inference: For a firm with 15 
24:782:53528:13:13:107:538:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:attorneys, being an associate (relative to being a partner) reduces our measure, the log of % Time 
24:783:53627:13:13:107:515:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:in Client Contact, by -0.32, or approximately 32 percent for % Time in Client Contact.  The 
24:784:53719:13:13:107:533:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:corresponding effect for being an associate in a firm with 75 attorneys is -0.51, which translates 
24:785:53818:13:13:107:509:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to an approximately 51 percent decline in % Time in Client Contact.  These inferences are 
24:786:53908:13:13:107:535:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:similar to those one would draw directly from Table 1:  In a firm with 10-20 lawyers, % Time in 
24:787:54004:13:13:107:531:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:Client Contact is 26 percent lower for associates than partners.  In a firm with 61-90 lawyers,    
24:788:54103:13:0:107:436:74:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:% Time in Client Contact is 56 percent lower for associates than partners. 
25:789:54180:0:24:71:531:698:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:listed in column 1.  The first two rows of Table 3 reproduce the coefficient on ASSOCIATE*LOG 
25:790:54274:24:24:71:538:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FIRM SIZE found in columns (2) and (4) of Table 2.  The negative coefficients in rows (1) and (2) 
25:791:54372:24:24:71:533:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imply that as firm size increases, the percentage of work time associates devote to client contact 
25:792:54471:24:24:71:537:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and development falls.  Row 3 reports results of a regression analyzing the fraction of time spent 
25:793:54570:24:24:71:527:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:doing research and writing memos.  The coefficient on ASSOCIATE*LOG FIRM SIZE   is positive 
25:794:54662:24:24:71:529:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and statistically significant, indicating that associates in large firms spend more of their time in 
25:795:54763:24:24:71:538:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:research and writing.  Finally, the coefficient on ASSOCIATE*LOG FIRM SIZE in row 4 is negative, 
25:796:54860:24:24:71:508:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implying that associates in large firms spend less time in negotiations than their small firm 
25:797:54954:24:24:71:136:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:counterparts. 
25:798:54968:24:24:107:514:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In interpreting the first four rows of Table 3, it is important to note that the activities 
25:799:55060:24:24:71:503:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:being analyzed are not mutually exclusive.  Thus negotiations are likely to entail a certain 
25:800:55153:24:24:71:529:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amount of client contact and client development may also involve certain types of negotiation.  
25:801:55249:24:24:71:525:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Research and memo-writing, however, can often be conducted under the supervision of senior 
25:802:55340:24:24:71:258:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attorneys and in isolation from clients. 
25:803:55381:24:24:107:475:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The remaining activities included in the ABA survey (depositions, trials and 
25:804:55458:24:24:71:527:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:administrative court proceedings, drafting instruments, clerical work, misc. personal activities, 
25:805:55556:24:24:71:530:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and non-law related work) do not differ in a statistically significant manner across associates in 
25:806:55655:24:24:71:178:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:large and small firms. 
25:807:55678:24:24:107:529:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Taken together, the results in Tables 1-3 are consistent with our “grabbing and leaving” 
25:808:55767:24:24:71:496:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model.  In what follows, we consider whether these results are consistent with two other 
25:809:55856:24:24:71:478:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important alternative explanations: tournament models and models of human capital 
25:810:55938:24:24:71:204:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accumulation within firms. 
25:811:55965:24:24:107:536:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The standard explanation for up-or-out employment contracts in the economics literature 
25:812:56053:24:24:71:524:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emphasizes the “dual incentive” problems created when employers try to induce employees to 
25:813:56144:24:24:71:485:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make hard-to-monitor investments in firm specific skills (Kahn and Huberman, 1988; 
25:814:56227:24:24:71:538:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Prendergast, 1993; and Waldman, 1990).  According to this story, law firms create incentives for 
25:815:56324:24:0:71:541:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates to invest in firm specific skills by promising a valuable promotion to some or all of the 
26:816:56427:0:24:71:509:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates who undertake the investments.  It is difficult, however, for outsiders to monitor 
26:817:56521:24:24:71:520:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether the associates have actually met the firm's requirements.  This gives the employer an 
26:818:56615:24:24:71:534:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentive to cheat the associate by denying promotion even when the associate has performed as 
26:819:56710:24:24:71:520:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the firm desires.  Since the employees anticipate cheating by the firm, no investments in firm-
26:820:56805:24:24:71:231:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific human capital are made. 
26:821:56838:24:24:107:541:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A firm’s commitment to an up-or-out employment system can potentially resolve the dual 
26:822:56925:24:24:71:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentive problem.  Firms will find it in their interest to promote those employees who have most 
26:823:57023:24:24:71:519:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:successfully made the desired investments.  Employees can see that their investments will be 
26:824:57116:24:24:71:316:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rewarded and therefore undertake the investments. 
26:825:57166:24:24:107:501:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The dual incentive model of law firm organization offers both an imaginative and 
26:826:57247:24:24:71:532:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:logically coherent account for up-or-out promotion rules.  Applying the dual incentive model to 
26:827:57343:24:24:71:526:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our data on time-use, we would naturally assume that attorneys generally acquire firm-specific 
26:828:57438:24:24:71:495:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(often client-specific) knowledge in the course of performing the various legal activities 
26:829:57529:24:24:71:524:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presented in Table 3.  In addition, we know from casual observation as well as from empirical 
26:830:57623:24:24:71:528:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:research that the expected value of prizes for promotion to partner in large firms are far greater 
26:831:57722:24:24:71:498:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than in small firms (see Rebitzer and Taylor, 1995).  From this perspective, then, we can 
26:832:57812:24:24:71:518:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reinterpret Tables 1-3 as follows: As firm size increases, the incentive to make investment in 
26:833:57907:24:24:71:539:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm-specific human capital also increases.  These heightened levels of human capital investment 
26:834:58004:24:24:71:532:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appear to involve less client contact and more research and memo writing.  But why should this 
26:835:58099:24:24:71:541:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be so?  There is no obvious explanation in the dual incentive model.  One could, perhaps, assume 
26:836:58196:24:24:71:532:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that this is a feature of the technology for providing legal services, but this post-hoc assumption 
26:837:58296:24:24:71:536:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would need some justification that is not provided within the human capital models.  In contrast, 
26:838:58394:24:24:71:536:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the grabbing and leaving model predicts that large law firms, with long-standing relationships to 
26:839:58492:24:24:71:530:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important corporate clients, would implement a kind of legal production technology that would 
26:840:58586:24:24:71:295:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:keep non-partners at arms-length from clients. 
26:841:58633:24:24:107:541:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Based on this reasoning, we argue that the dual incentive model of up-or-out practices fits 
26:842:58725:24:0:71:531:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our empirical observations less well than our grabbing and leaving model.  Looking beyond the 
27:843:58821:0:24:71:521:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence in our tables, there are institutional factors that also cast doubt on the dual incentive 
27:844:58920:24:24:71:524:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model—namely that the attorneys who are promoted become residual claimants to the surplus 
27:845:59010:24:24:71:542:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produced by the enterprise.  Explaining the partnership aspect of the up-or-out partnership system 
27:846:59109:24:24:71:402:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requires some consideration of the problem of grabbing and leaving. 
27:847:59177:24:24:107:516:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second important limitation of these dual incentive models of up-or-out is the way 
27:848:59262:24:24:71:538:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dismissal is handled.  The dual incentive model requires that dismissal from the firm be costly to 
27:849:59361:24:24:71:538:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the associates who are not promoted.  Indeed, the more costly is dismissal, the more effective the 
27:850:59460:24:24:71:525:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentive to accumulate the desired human capital.  From this perspective, it is hard to explain 
27:851:59557:24:24:71:519:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:why large law firms often help their associates find good jobs at other firms.22  It is similarly 
27:852:59655:24:24:71:527:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hard for the dual incentive models to explain why firms often retained permanent associates of 
27:853:59750:24:24:71:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:limited ability for “back office” work.23  These practices can be incorporated quite easily into the 
27:854:59851:24:24:71:533:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:property rights approach.  In this latter model, work incentives do not rely upon dismissal costs, 
27:855:59950:24:24:71:505:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and firms can benefit if they reduce the risk of the up-or-out contest by effectively placing 
27:856:60044:24:24:71:520:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates who are not promoted.  Similarly, firms are willing to retain permanent associates, 
27:857:60139:24:24:71:408:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provided they do not constitute a threat to grab and leave with clients. 
27:858:60212:24:24:107:520:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Tournament models, like dual incentive models, use deferred compensation to induce 
27:859:60295:24:24:71:484:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:work effort.  In a tournament model, associates are hired in period 1 and their relative 
27:860:60384:24:24:71:530:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:performance is assessed.  The high performing associates are rewarded by promotion to partner 
27:861:60478:24:47:71:533:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the relatively poor performers are let go.  To the extent that the tournaments are designed to 
27:862:60577:47:24:251:254:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
27:863:60625:24:16:71:529:195:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:22  Galanter and Palay (1991, p. 29) describe the practices of large corporate law firms as follows: 
27:864:60726:16:13:107:532:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:“For associates who did not make partner, firms undertook out-placement, recommending them 
27:865:60817:13:13:107:526:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for jobs with client corporations and with smaller firms.  Ties might be maintained as the firm 
27:866:60913:13:24:107:447:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:referred legal work to them or served as outside counsel to the corporation.” 
27:867:60991:24:16:71:498:129:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:23  But most “permanent associates were ‘failures,’ second-class citizens who had not been 
27:868:61082:16:13:107:527:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:promoted but stayed on and were assigned routine work—especially ‘back office’ work which 
27:869:61172:13:13:107:529:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:did not involve dealing with clients... Of all those who had started out at the Cravath firm from 
27:870:61270:13:13:107:516:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1906 to 1948, 16 remained permanent associates—almost half as many as became partners” 
27:871:61357:13:0:107:232:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(Galanter and Palay, p. 26). 
28:872:61388:0:24:71:531:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:elicit investments in human capital, tournament models share all the predictions and limitations 
28:873:61485:24:24:71:525:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the dual incentive models.  To the extent that tournaments are designed to elicit work effort 
28:874:61582:24:24:71:497:650:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:per se, they do not make predictions about the allocations of effort across different work 
28:875:61673:24:24:71:527:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activities as described in Table 3.  Tournament models that focus solely on work effort also do 
28:876:61769:24:26:71:465:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not predict that the winners of the tournament be granted residual claimant status. 
28:877:61853:26:24:71:361:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Incidence of Up-or-Out Systems in Law and Elsewhere 
28:878:61908:24:24:107:541:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Dual incentive models have difficulty accounting for the variation of up-or-out promotion 
28:879:61998:24:24:71:537:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rules across different legal settings.  Attorneys working in government or in the legal department 
28:880:62097:24:24:71:531:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of corporations are not hired under up-or-out contracts and are not promoted to positions where 
28:881:62193:24:24:71:533:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they are residual claimants of the enterprise.  The dual incentive approach might account for the 
28:882:62291:24:24:71:510:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variation in incidence of up-or-out rules if (somewhat implausibly) the problem of eliciting 
28:883:62384:24:24:71:542:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investments in human capital is greater in large law firms than in government offices or corporate 
28:884:62483:24:24:71:533:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:legal departments.  In contrast, under the property rights approach this variation in the use of up-
28:885:62583:24:24:71:534:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or-out is natural.  Up-or-out rules are unnecessary in corporate legal departments or government 
28:886:62680:24:24:71:471:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jobs because the key client (the corporation or government) is also the employer.24 
28:887:62763:24:24:107:538:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We have argued that the up-or-out employment structure evolved in law firms because of 
28:888:62850:24:42:71:537:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the difficulty of otherwise retaining control over the disposition of the key asset, long term client 
28:889:62952:42:24:251:254:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
28:890:63000:24:16:71:524:246:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:24  A third alternative explanation for up-or-out rules has to do with screening.  If an individual’s 
28:891:63102:16:13:107:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:productivity as a senior attorney can be observed by their performance as a junior attorney, firms 
28:892:63201:13:13:107:527:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may terminate a capable junior attorney in order to observe another candidate (O’Flaherty and 
28:893:63295:13:13:107:520:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Siow, 1992).  If screening during the associate period were solely for the purpose of learning 
28:894:63390:13:13:107:536:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:how well an associate would perform as a partner, one would expect that the tasks performed by 
28:895:63485:13:13:107:512:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:associates would resemble those of partners.  If client relationships were a critical part of a 
28:896:63581:13:13:107:534:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:partner’s role, associates should be given responsibility for developing these relationships prior 
28:897:63679:13:13:107:539:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to promotion.  While this practice is common in large consultancies, the tasks analyzed in Tables 
28:898:63777:13:13:107:541:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1-3 do not follow this pattern.  One might want to explain the differences between the time use of 
28:899:63876:13:13:107:503:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:partners and associates as resulting from partners pushing undesirable “grunt” work onto 
28:900:63965:13:13:107:502:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:associates, but there is no a priori reason to believe that client contact is inherently more 
28:901:64059:13:13:107:536:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pleasurable than other activities listed in Table 3.  Screening of some type may play a role in the 
28:902:64159:13:13:107:528:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:career path of large law firms (see Landers, Rebitzer and Taylor, 1996), but the coincidence of 
28:903:64255:13:0:107:506:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:partnerships with up-or-out promotion rules is not readily explained by screening models. 
29:904:64347:0:24:71:492:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships.  A large class of professional service firms have assets bound up in client 
29:905:64438:24:24:71:534:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships, yet only some of these (notably accounting firms and some consulting firms) have 
29:906:64534:24:24:71:514:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:used the type of employment contracts found among attorneys in large law firms.  Are these 
29:907:64625:24:24:71:484:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variations inconsistent with our property rights approach employment relationships?   
29:908:64711:24:24:107:541:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our model requires that experienced lawyers must either be promoted into the partnership

29:910:64887:24:24:71:523:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:independent relationships with clients.  In generalizing our story outside of law, it is therefore 
29:911:64986:24:24:71:529:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:necessary to consider the ability of the firm to regulate relationships between professionals and 
29:912:65084:24:24:71:515:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clients.  This sort of analysis requires the answer to questions that are very context specific.  
29:913:65182:24:24:71:526:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Does the firm have control over a non-human asset that is necessary for delivering the service, 
29:914:65278:24:24:71:524:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:e.g., a specialized machine, a copyright, or a patent?  Is it possible for the firm to sign binding 
29:915:65378:24:24:71:537:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-compete agreements with employees? Are the services delivered complex enough to require 
29:916:65470:24:24:71:501:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the efforts of a team of professionals with specific knowledge?  Law firms are interesting 
29:917:65561:24:24:71:527:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because the answer to these questions are similar across most large firms.  The same cannot be 
29:918:65656:24:24:71:514:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:said in many other professional settings.  Consultancies, for example, can effectively inhibit 
29:919:65751:24:24:71:502:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grabbing and leaving with clients through the use of non-compete agreements.25  In most 
29:920:65839:24:24:71:496:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:physician practices, especially primary care practices, the delivery of medical services is 
29:921:65931:24:24:71:251:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:essentially done by solo physicians.   
29:922:65970:24:24:107:535:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:High technology firms raise some of the same issues that professionals service firms do.  
29:923:66060:24:24:71:527:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In high technology firms, many of the key assets of the enterprise are bound up in the brains of 
29:924:66157:24:24:71:523:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:crucial employees.  Property rights to some of these intellectual assets can be secured through 
29:925:66253:24:24:71:525:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:patents or copyrights.  When adequate control cannot be attained through intellectual property 
29:926:66348:24:24:71:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rights, one should expect to see innovations in the employment relationship that reduce the firm's 
29:927:66447:24:32:71:526:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vulnerability to loosing valuable assets.  In some instances, high technology companies reduce

29:929:66590:24:16:71:506:90:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:25  See, e.g., Fallick, Fleishman, and Rebitzer (forthcoming) and Gilson (1999) for economic 
29:930:66683:16:0:107:275:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analyses of non-compete agreements. 
30:931:66721:0:24:71:521:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the incentive of key “knowledge workers” to leave through the use of stock options and other 
30:932:66814:24:24:71:537:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forms of deferred compensation that become dramatically less valuable when the employee exits

30:934:66922:24:24:107:536:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The tenure system found in many colleges and some public school systems resembles up-
30:935:67007:24:24:71:519:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or-out in some superficial ways.  In universities, for example, professors who are not granted 
30:936:67102:24:24:71:516:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tenure before some specified time period are required to find work elsewhere.  Despite these 
30:937:67195:24:24:71:510:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:superficial similarities to the system in large law firms, we do not believe our grabbing and 
30:938:67289:24:24:71:530:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:leaving model applies to universities.  After all, in the university context, there is no equivalent 
30:939:67390:24:24:71:528:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the large corporate client relationship in law firms.  Carmichael (1988) offers, in our view, a 
30:940:67489:24:24:71:419:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more compelling economic explanation for university tenure systems.27 
30:941:67558:24:24:107:527:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our model opens up at least one line of inquiry that we do not pursue here—the role of 
30:942:67645:24:24:71:500:434:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:reputation.  To the extent that a reputation for excellence rests with individual attorneys, 
30:943:67738:24:24:71:531:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grabbing and leaving is will be a real possibility, and in consequence firms will face the serious 
30:944:67837:24:24:71:533:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:challenges for organization design we discuss in this paper.  On the other hand, if the reputation 
30:945:67936:24:24:71:513:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for excellence rests with the firm (i.e., because the firm has been able to consistently recruit 
30:946:68033:24:80:71:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unusually talented attorneys), this might reduce the problem of grabbing and leaving, and thereby 
30:947:68131:80:24:251:254:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
30:948:68179:24:16:71:509:234:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:26  Stock options are not available to law firms because rules of professional conduct prohibit 
30:949:68275:16:13:107:518:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outside ownership of stock in a law firm.  (Even if these rules did not exist, the nature of the 
30:950:68372:13:13:107:531:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:knowledge assets in these firms might work against the existence of stable markets for equity.)  
30:951:68469:13:24:107:446:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since there is no market for the stock of a law firm, options are not feasible. 
30:952:68549:24:16:71:530:168:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:27  Carmichael’s argument rests on the specialized knowledge acquired by senior professors.  This 
30:953:68647:16:13:107:534:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:knowledge gives senior professors in a department superior ability to spot talented junior hires.  
30:954:68746:13:13:107:526:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The university grants tenure, in Carmichael’s view, as an incentive compatible mechanism for 
30:955:68839:13:13:107:505:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inducing professors in a department to hire the very best candidates available. It might be 
30:956:68931:13:13:107:537:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:objected that a model of up-or-out that applies to law firms and professional partnerships but not 
30:957:69030:13:13:107:537:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to academic departments is necessarily an incomplete explanation, but this objection rests on the 
30:958:69128:13:13:107:533:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:faulty assumption that similar promotion rules must have similar functions even if they occur in 
30:959:69225:13:0:107:472:74:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:very different organizations functioning in very different economic environments. 
31:960:69309:0:24:71:521:698:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allow the firm more flexibility in organizational design.28  The role of reputation is doubtless 
31:961:69406:24:24:71:417:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important for law firms, and systematic study of this issue is merited.

31:963:69485:26:24:266:349:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: VI. Conclusion 
31:964:69501:24:24:107:510:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:From the property rights perspective, large law firms are poorly suited to sustaining 
31:965:69587:24:24:71:533:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment relationships because they have no enforceable means of controlling the firm’s key 
31:966:69681:24:24:71:541:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:knowledge asset—client relationships.  The up-or-out partnership systems that have evolved over 
31:967:69777:24:24:71:518:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time in these firms offer an awkward but workable resolution to this problem.  By restricting 
31:968:69871:24:24:71:499:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:partnership size to maximize surplus per partner and by making senior attorneys residual 
31:969:69960:24:24:71:528:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:claimants, law firms limit the opportunity for sub-groups of partners to grab and leave with the 
31:970:70057:24:24:71:538:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm's clients.  This action, however, creates additional demand for inexperienced associates who 
31:971:70155:24:24:71:532:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:serve as (imperfect) substitutes for their more experienced counterparts.  The result is that more 
31:972:70254:24:24:71:537:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associates are hired than can be promoted into a stable partnership.  Those associates who do not 
31:973:70352:24:24:71:526:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:succeed outgoing partners will be dismissed before they acquire sufficient client knowledge to 
31:974:70447:24:24:71:538:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:themselves pose a threat of grabbing and leaving. That law firms find it worthwhile to commit to 
31:975:70544:24:24:71:534:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the costly practice of firing qualified attorneys in order to retain control over client relationships 
31:976:70647:24:24:71:501:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:points to the general importance of control over assets in more conventional employment 
31:977:70735:24:24:71:138:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships. 
31:978:70750:24:24:107:534:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The property rights model, in contrast to other explanations, can explain the coincidence 
31:979:70840:24:24:71:536:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of up-or-out promotion rules and partnerships in large law firms.  At the root of our model is the 
31:980:70939:24:24:71:490:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:claim that law firms cannot rely upon legal mechanisms to establish control over client 
31:981:71027:24:24:71:512:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships.  We demonstrate that this is, in fact, the case under U.S. law.  In addition, the 
31:982:71124:24:24:71:522:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:property rights model suggests two propositions that are supported by the available historical, 
31:983:71220:24:43:71:532:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutional and econometric evidence: (1) up-or-out appeared first in large corporate law firms 
31:984:71318:43:24:251:254:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
31:985:71366:24:0:71:364:77:10:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:28  We are grateful to a helpful referee for making this point.

32:987:71530:24:24:71:535:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and (2) large law firms practice a style of law that limits contact between associates and clients.  
32:988:71631:24:24:71:536:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally, the property rights model can account for the otherwise anomalous absence of up-or-out

32:990:71813:24:24:107:539:602:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The presence of knowledge based assets is not unique to law firms.  It is commonplace to

32:994:72168:24:24:71:518:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature so far, however, are narrowly focused case studies that elaborate the organizational 
32:995:72264:24:24:71:248:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consequences of knowledge assets.   
32:996:72300:24:24:107:510:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Based on the results of this study, we believe that the property rights perspective on
