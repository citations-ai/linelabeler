2:40:2549:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Consumer bankruptcy is one of the largest social insurance programs in the United States, but little
2:41:2649:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is known about its impact on debtors. We use 500,000 bankruptcy filings matched to administrative
2:42:2746:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tax and foreclosure data to estimate the impact of Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on subsequent
2:43:2843:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:outcomes. Exploiting the random assignment of bankruptcy filings to judges, we find that Chapter
2:44:2939:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:13 protection increases annual earnings by $5,562, decreases five-year mortality by 1.2 percentage
2:45:3037:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:points, and decreases five-year foreclosure rates by 19.1 percentage points. These results come primarily
2:46:3142:14:42:72:487:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from the deterioration of outcomes among dismissed filers, not gains by granted filers.

3:67:4003:16:16:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than through all state unemployment insurance programs combined (Lefgren, McIntyre, and Miller
3:68:4097:16:17:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2010), with nearly one in ten American households having filed for bankruptcy at some point
3:69:4188:17:16:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Stavins 2000). The U.S. bankruptcy system is also among the most generous in the world, allowing
3:70:4285:16:17:72:540:549:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtors to choose between Chapter 7 bankruptcy that provides debt relief and protection from wage
3:71:4382:17:16:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment in exchange for a debtor’s non-exempt assets, and Chapter 13 bankruptcy that adds
3:72:4475:16:17:72:422:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the protection of most assets in exchange for a partial repayment of debt.
3:73:4549:17:16:88:539:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Despite providing billions of dollars in debt relief each year, it is not clear how bankruptcy pro-
3:74:4648:16:17:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tection impacts debtors. In theory, bankruptcy protection increases an individual’s incentive to work
3:75:4749:17:16:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and prevents any sharp drops in consumption that may have important long-term consequences,
3:76:4840:16:16:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such as becoming sick due to the lack of medical care or losing one’s home through foreclosure.
3:77:4935:16:17:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Yet, in practice, households work about the same number of hours (Han and Li 2007), accumu-
3:78:5026:17:16:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:late less wealth (Han and Li 2011), and have less access to credit (Cohen-Cole, Duygan-Bump and
3:79:5121:16:17:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Montoriol-Garriga 2009) after receiving bankruptcy protection, leading some to conclude that the
3:80:5217:17:16:72:540:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefits of debt relief have been overstated (Porter and Thorne 2006). The lack of demonstrable
3:81:5312:16:17:72:540:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefits, combined with a rapid increase in the number of bankruptcy filings, led Congress to enact
3:82:5411:17:16:72:524:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:new barriers to filing in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act.
3:83:5502:16:16:88:539:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Empirically estimating the impact of bankruptcy protection has been complicated by two impor-
3:84:5595:16:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tant issues. First, there is little information on the long-term outcomes of most bankruptcy filers.
3:85:5695:17:16:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy filers are not tracked in a systematic way after filing and datasets such as the PSID
3:86:5791:16:17:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and NLSY include only a few hundred bankrupt households. Second, most comparisons are biased
3:87:5883:17:16:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to selection and endogeneity problems. Bankruptcy filers are likely to have had worse outcomes
3:88:5981:16:17:72:540:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even before filing, biasing cross-sectional comparisons (e.g. Han and Li 2007, 2011), and most prox-
3:89:6081:17:16:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imate causes of bankruptcy such as job loss and health shocks also impact later outcomes, biasing
3:90:6178:16:16:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:within-individual comparisons (e.g. Cohen-Cole, Duygan-Bump and Montoriol-Garriga 2009). The
3:91:6270:16:17:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lack of an unbiased counterfactual control group may help explain why the previous literature has
3:92:6367:17:16:72:383:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:found little evidence that bankruptcy protection benefits debtors.
3:93:6433:16:17:88:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we use a new dataset linking 500,000 bankruptcy filings to administrative tax

4:102:7269:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is significant variation in the interpretation of these criteria across judges (Sullivan, Warren,
4:103:7372:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Westbrook 1994, Norberg and Compo 2007, Chang and Schoar 2008).  As a result, other-
4:104:7460:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wise identical filers are assigned to judges with substantially different rates of granting bankruptcy

4:107:7669:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we are able to identify the ex-post impact of Chapter 13 on the marginal recipient of protection –
4:108:7767:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers whose bankruptcy decision is altered by the judge assignment due to disagreement on whether
4:109:7865:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or not they should receive bankruptcy protection. The identified parameter holds fixed any ex-

4:112:8148:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of formal insurance (Mahoney 2012). Our empirical strategy is similar to Kling (2006), which uses

4:119:8751:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:benefits debtors. Over the first five post-filing years, Chapter 13 protection increases the marginal
4:120:8852:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recipient’s annual earnings by $5,562, a 25.1 percent increase from the pre-filing mean. Employment
4:121:8951:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases by 6.8 percentage points over the same time period, an 8.3 percent increase. Five-year
4:122:9047:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality decreases by 1.2 percentage points, a 30.0 percent decrease from the dismissed filer mor-
4:123:9146:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tality rate, and five-year home foreclosure rates decrease by 19.1 percentage points, a more than
4:124:9243:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:100 percent decrease from the dismissed filer foreclosure rate. There is also evidence that Chapter
4:125:9342:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:13 protection deceases the receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), although there is little
4:126:9440:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to no impact on 401k contributions and the receipt of Disability Insurance (DI). Descriptive results
4:127:9540:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggest that the estimated impacts come from the deterioration of outcomes among dismissed filers,
4:128:9638:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not gains by granted filers. Filers granted bankruptcy protection have similar pre- and post-filing
4:129:9737:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings. In contrast, dismissed filers experience large and persistent drops in earnings after filing
4:130:9839:17:16:72:145:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for bankruptcy.
4:131:9854:16:16:88:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We find evidence of two mechanisms through which bankruptcy protection benefits filers. First,
4:132:9948:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we find that the impact of Chapter 13 protection is larger when creditors are allowed to garnish a
4:133:10046:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtor’s earnings. Exploiting within- and across-state variation in the marginal garnishment rate,
4:134:10144:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we find that the implied earnings elasticity with respect to potential garnishment is 0.94. These
4:135:10241:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results are consistent with the idea that bankruptcy protection maintains the incentive to work
4:136:10336:16:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by preventing an increase in the effective marginal tax rate on earnings. Second, we find results
4:137:10433:17:16:72:540:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggesting that Chapter 13 protection helps to maintain economic stability by reducing foreclosures
4:138:10532:16:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and by reducing strategic moves to evade creditors. The marginal recipient of Chapter 13 protection
5:139:10632:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is 24.6 percentage points more likely to work in his or her pre-filing job, 23.8 percentage points more
5:140:10735:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to work in the same industry, and 15.3 percentage points more likely to work in the same
5:141:10830:16:17:72:98:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state.
5:142:10836:17:16:88:539:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are three important caveats to our analysis. First, our identification strategy measures the
5:143:10934:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect of Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection for the marginal recipient. It is possible that the impact
5:144:11035:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Chapter 13 protection is different for filers who are not on the margin of receipt. To partially
5:145:11134:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:address this issue, we estimate marginal treatment effects (MTEs) that measure the change in
5:146:11226:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes for the marginal recipient of bankruptcy protection as we move from more strict judges to
5:147:11324:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more lenient judges. The MTE results suggest that the effects of Chapter 13 protection are slightly
5:148:11423:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:larger for less deserving filers. Second, we are only able to use our instrumental variables strategy in
5:149:11527:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy offices that randomly assign filings to judges. While our instrumental variables sample
5:150:11625:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is broadly similar to the full sample of Chapter 13 filers, it is possible that the effect of bankruptcy
5:151:11729:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may differ in the two samples. To provide some evidence on this issue, we estimate the impact
5:152:11822:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Chapter 13 in both samples using an event study methodology that does not rely on random
5:153:11913:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assignment. We find that the impact of Chapter 13 protection is similar in our instrumental variables
5:154:12014:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and full samples, though the point estimates are somewhat smaller in our full sample. Third, we are
5:155:12113:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unable to use our instrumental variables strategy to estimate the impact of Chapter 7 bankruptcy
5:156:12209:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection, which make up approximately 75 percent of all bankruptcy filings.  Using our event
5:157:12303:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:study design, we find that the effect of Chapter 7 protection is more modest than that of Chapter
5:158:12400:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:13 protection. Filers granted Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection earn $1,639 to $1,936 more than
5:159:12493:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dismissed filers over the first five post-filing years and are 2.7 percentage points more likely to be
5:160:12595:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employed over the same time period. Filers granted Chapter 7 also have five-year foreclosure rates
5:161:12693:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that are 1.7 percentage points lower than dismissed filers, but are neither more nor less likely to be
5:162:12795:16:17:72:326:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deceased after five years compared to dismissed filers.
5:163:12850:17:16:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section I provides a brief overview of the
5:164:12945:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consumer bankruptcy system in the United States. Section II describes our data and provides sum-
5:165:13041:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mary statistics. Section III presents a stylized model that motivates our empirical exercise. Section
5:166:13142:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:IV describes our empirical strategy.  Section V estimates the impact of Chapter 13 bankruptcy
5:167:13235:17:33:72:484:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection on labor supply, mortality, and home foreclosure, and Section VI concludes.

5:169:13355:21:24:275:336:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A. Overview
5:170:13366:24:16:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy is the legal process to resolve unpaid debts. In the United States, individual debtors
5:171:13463:16:24:72:460:154:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:are allowed to choose between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.2
5:172:13541:24:15:87:539:130:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2The most commonly reported cause of bankruptcy is an unexpected income or expense shock. In a hand-collected
5:173:13650:15:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:sample of bankruptcy filers, 67.5 percent of filers report job loss as a precipitating factor, 22.1 percent report family
5:174:13771:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:issues such as divorce, and 19.3 report medical expenses (Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook 2000), with other work
5:175:13883:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:suggesting a somewhat larger role for medical expenses (Domowitz and Sartain 1999, Warren, Sullivan, and Jacoby
5:176:13994:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2000, Himmelstein et al. 2009). Using similar data from PSID, Fay, Hurst, and White (2002) find that households
5:177:14105:10:0:72:540:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:are more likely to file for bankruptcy protection when there are larger financial benefits to doing so, and that there
6:178:14224:0:17:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Under Chapter 7, debtors forfeit all non-exempt assets in exchange for a discharge of eligible
6:179:14318:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debts and protection from future wage garnishment.  Nearly all unsecured debts are eligible for
6:180:14413:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discharge under Chapter 7, including credit card debt, installment loans, medical debt, unpaid rent
6:181:14512:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and utility bills, tort judgments, and business debt. Student loans, child support obligations, and
6:182:14611:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debts incurred by fraud cannot be discharged under Chapter 7, and secured debts such as mortgages,
6:183:14709:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:home equity loans, and automobile loans can only be discharged if debtors give up the collateral. As
6:184:14809:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most debtors have little non-exempt wealth or can move all non-exempt wealth into exempt assets
6:185:14904:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before filing, the average repayment rate under Chapter 7 is only about one percent (Sullivan et
6:186:15000:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:al. 1989). Chapter 7 is chosen by the majority of filers in the United States, with 79.8 percent of
6:187:15099:16:17:72:276:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtors in our data filing under Chapter 7.
6:188:15142:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 7 cases begin with the debtor filing a bankruptcy petition, a statement of financial
6:189:15234:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:affairs, a copy of his or her most recent tax return, executory contracts and unexpired leases, and
6:190:15333:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schedules of current income, expenditures, and assets and liabilities.  The assigned bankruptcy
6:191:15428:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trustee then holds a meeting with the debtor to ensure that the debtor is aware of the potential
6:192:15524:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adverse consequences of bankruptcy and to flag any potential issues for the bankruptcy judge. The
6:193:15621:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy judge will confirm or dismiss the application using the information from the filing and
6:194:15719:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the trustee’s report. If the filing is confirmed, the trustee liquidates the debtor’s property and splits
6:195:15824:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it among the creditors. If the filing is dismissed, the debtor must exit the bankruptcy system and
6:196:15922:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may not refile under either chapter for at least six years. In our data, 98.4 percent of Chapter 7
6:197:16020:17:16:72:256:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filings ending with a discharge of debt.
6:198:16060:16:17:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Under Chapter 13, filers propose a three- to five-year plan to repay part of their unsecured debt in
6:199:16160:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exchange for a discharge of the remaining unsecured debt, protection from future wage garnishment,
6:200:16258:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and protection of most assets. For example, Chapter 13 allows debtors to retain assets pledged as
6:201:16355:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:collateral by including the collateral amount in the repayment plan. Chapter 13 also allows debtors
6:202:16454:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to avoid home foreclosure by including any mortgage arrears in the repayment plan, with the original
6:203:16554:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortgage reinstated after completion of the plan. Seventy percent of dismissed Chapter 13 filers
6:204:16650:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:report that avoiding foreclosure is their principal reason for choosing to file under Chapter 13 (Porter
6:205:16754:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2011), with 71 percent of filers from a sample of Delaware cases including mortgage arrears in their
6:206:16854:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:repayment plans, 41 percent including car loans, and 38 percent including priority debt (White and
6:207:16952:16:17:72:123:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Zhu 2010).
6:208:16962:17:16:88:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 cases begin with the debtor filing a repayment plan and the paperwork described
6:209:17052:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above. After a meeting between the debtor and bankruptcy trustee, the bankruptcy judge decides
6:210:17146:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether the repayment plan is feasible and meets the standards for confirmation set forth in the
6:211:17242:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy Code.3If the judge confirms the repayment plan, the debtor makes regular payments
6:212:17334:16:35:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the trustee until the plan is complete. The judge may dismiss or convert the case to Chapter 7 if
6:213:17434:35:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:is little impact of adverse shocks such as unemployment or divorce of the filing after conditioning on the financial
6:214:17550:11:7:72:106:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:benefits.
6:215:17559:7:15:87:539:97:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3There is typically one Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee that works with all judges in an office. If an office has
6:216:17670:15:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:a particularly high Chapter 13 caseload, judges may have their own Chapter 13 trustee.  Chapter 7 trustees are
6:217:17780:11:0:72:391:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:randomly assigned in a process that is independent from the judge assignment.
7:218:17858:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the debtor fails to make any payments, fails to pay any post-filing domestic support obligations, or
7:219:17958:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fails to make required tax filings during the case. In our data, 48.8 percent of Chapter 13 filings end
7:220:18061:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a discharge of debt. If a Chapter 13 filing is dismissed, debtors may refile for either Chapter 7
7:221:18163:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or Chapter 13 after only 180 days. While almost no dismissed Chapter 13 filers in our sample refile
7:222:18262:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under Chapter 13, approximately 20 percent choose to refile under Chapter 7. Thus, we estimate the
7:223:18360:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of receiving Chapter 13 protection relative to both no bankruptcy protection and protection
7:224:18458:16:32:72:504:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:via Chapter 7. All of our estimates should be interpreted with this counterfactual in mind.
7:225:18549:32:23:240:371:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B. U.S. Bankruptcy Courts
7:226:18574:23:17:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are 94 Federal bankruptcy courts in the United States, with at least one court in each state,
7:227:18673:17:16:72:540:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Each bankruptcy court hears all cases originating from
7:228:18770:16:17:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:counties in its jurisdiction. Bankruptcy courts are often further divided into offices that hear all
7:229:18870:17:16:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cases originating from a subset of counties in the court’s jurisdiction. Appendix Figure 1 displays
7:230:18969:16:16:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 72 courts and 205 offices that we have data for. The median court in our sample is divided into
7:231:19068:16:17:72:457:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three offices, with little systematic pattern to the number of offices in each office.
7:232:19154:17:16:88:539:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy judges are appointed to fourteen-year terms by the court of appeals in their judicial
7:233:19250:16:17:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:district. Bankruptcy judges only hear cases filed in their court, but often hear cases across multiple
7:234:19352:17:16:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:offices within their court. Within each bankruptcy office, cases are typically assigned to judges using
7:235:19455:16:17:72:335:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a random number generator or a blind rotation system.
7:236:19508:17:16:88:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The assigned bankruptcy judge decides any and all matters connected to a case, including
7:237:19596:16:16:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether or not to dismiss the filing.  The most common reason a filing is dismissed is that it
7:238:19690:16:17:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:constitutes a “substantial abuse” of the bankruptcy process, typically meaning that a debtor should
7:239:19789:17:16:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be able to repay his or her debts without bankruptcy protection. Other common reasons for dismissal
7:240:19888:16:17:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include a filing missing important information, a Chapter 13 repayment plan being infeasible, or a
7:241:19986:17:16:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 repayment plan being too small (Hynes 2004). In Section IV, we discuss how we use
7:242:20078:16:17:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:systematic differences in the probability that a judge dismisses a filing to estimate the causal impact
7:243:20181:17:16:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of bankruptcy protection. These measured differences in judge behavior are likely to be the result
7:244:20279:16:17:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of differences in how judges interpret the criteria listed above, implying that more lenient judges
7:245:20378:17:16:72:494:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may confirm repayment plans that are more generous to debtors or that are less feasible.
7:246:20466:16:16:88:539:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Despite the pivotal role of bankruptcy judges, debtors typically have only limited involvement
7:247:20560:16:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the assigned judge. Chapter 7 filers do not appear before a judge unless a creditor or trustee
7:248:20659:17:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raises an objection. Chapter 13 filers appear before the bankruptcy judge at the plan confirma-
7:249:20754:16:17:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion hearing, but all other administrative aspects of the bankruptcy process are conducted by the
7:250:20851:17:16:72:294:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy trustee, not the bankruptcy judge.
7:251:20896:16:17:88:539:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is considerable variation in the number of bankruptcy judges in each bankruptcy court
7:252:20987:17:16:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and office, with courts serving more populous regions tending to have more judges. Appendix Figure
7:253:21085:16:16:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1 displays the number of Chapter 13 bankruptcy judges in each office that we have data for. Of the
7:254:21183:16:17:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:205 offices in our sample, 110 have only one Chapter 13 judge, 52 have two Chapter 13 judges, 25
7:255:21279:17:0:72:431:78:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have three Chapter 13 judges, and 18 have four or more Chapter 13 judges.
8:256:21353:0:23:193:419:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:C. Potential Benefits of Bankruptcy Protection
8:257:21399:23:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are at least two reasons debtors may benefit from bankruptcy protection. First, bankruptcy
8:258:21495:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection may maintain the incentive to work by protecting future wages from garnishment. Wage
8:259:21590:16:17:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishments occur when an employer is compelled by a court order to withhold a portion of an
8:260:21683:17:16:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employee’s earnings to repay a particular debt. Federal law limits the amount that may be garnished
8:261:21782:16:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in any one week to the lesser of 25 percent of weekly disposable earnings, or the amount by which
8:262:21879:17:16:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weekly disposable earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. Creditors are therefore able
8:263:21976:16:17:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to garnish 25 percent of each additional dollar of earnings above 40 times the federal minimum
8:264:22070:17:16:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage, 100 percent of earnings between 30 and 40 times the federal minimum wage, and nothing
8:265:22161:16:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings below 30 times the federal minimum wage.4Bankruptcy protection stops all current
8:266:22253:16:17:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment orders and prevents any future garnishment orders on discharged debt, increasing the
8:267:22349:17:16:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:marginal return to work. Consistent with this mechanism, the U.S. Supreme Court argued inLocal
8:268:22443:16:17:72:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:Loan Co.v.Hunt(1934) that eliminating these wage garnishments is “[o]ne of the primary purposes
8:269:22538:17:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Bankruptcy Act,” as “[f]rom the viewpoint of the wage earner, there is little difference between
8:270:22641:16:17:72:322:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not earning at all and earning wholly for a creditor.”
8:271:22695:17:16:88:539:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, bankruptcy protection may prevent economic instability. Creditors have a number of
8:272:22785:16:16:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:options to collect unpaid debts if a debtor has not filed for bankruptcy protection or after a case is
8:273:22887:16:17:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dismissed, including the wage garnishment orders discussed above, collection letters or phone calls,
8:274:22987:17:16:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in-person visits at home or work, and the seizing of assets through a court order (Hynes, Dawsey,
8:275:23084:16:17:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Ausubel 2009). Debtors can make these collection efforts more difficult by ignoring collection
8:276:23182:17:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:letters and calls, changing their telephone number, or moving without leaving a forwarding address.
8:277:23281:16:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Debtors can also leave the formal banking system to hide their assets from seizure, change jobs to
8:278:23379:17:16:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:force creditors to reinstate a garnishment order, or work less so that their earnings are not subject
8:279:23480:16:16:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to garnishment. Thus, bankruptcy protection may prevent economic instability by helping debtors
8:280:23575:16:17:72:540:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:avoid the kinds of sharp drops in consumption that have important long-term consequences, such as
8:281:23672:17:16:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:losing one’s home through foreclosure or becoming sick due to the lack of medical care. Bankruptcy
8:282:23770:16:17:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection may also reduce the incentive to strategically move across state lines or change jobs to
8:283:23869:17:16:72:145:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:avoid creditors.
8:284:23885:16:17:88:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are also many reasons to believe that bankruptcy protection will have little impact on
8:285:23977:17:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtors. It is possible that financially distressed households have highly inelastic labor supply, or
8:286:24078:16:17:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that debt relief will reduce the incentive to work through the income effect. It is also possible that
8:287:24180:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtors are able to avoid most debt collection efforts at a relatively low cost, or that garnishment
8:288:24280:16:16:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amounts are too low to impact labor supply decisions. Finally, it is possible that many bankruptcy
8:289:24378:16:17:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers are in financial distress due to low human capital or poor health that the bankruptcy system
8:290:24477:17:45:72:168:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is unable to remedy.
8:291:24497:45:15:87:539:97:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4Federal law allows garnishments of up to 50 percent of a debtor’s disposable earnings for payment related to
8:292:24606:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:child support or alimony if the worker is supporting another spouse or child, and up to 60 percent if the worker is
8:293:24721:10:0:72:502:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:not. An additional five percent may be garnished for court order payments more than 12 weeks in arrears.
9:294:24826:0:28:281:330:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:II. Data
9:295:24834:28:16:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To estimate the impact of bankruptcy protection on debtors, we merge information from individual
9:296:24930:16:16:72:540:664:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy filings, administrative tax records from the Social Security Administration (SSA), and
9:297:25027:16:17:72:396:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proprietary real estate records from the data aggregator DataQuick.
9:298:25094:17:16:88:539:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy records are available from 1992 to 2009 for the 72 federal bankruptcy courts that
9:299:25186:16:17:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:allow full electronic access to their dockets. These data represent approximately three quarters of
9:300:25285:17:16:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all bankruptcy filings during this period. Each record in our bankruptcy data contains information
9:301:25383:16:17:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the Chapter filed, filing date, court, office, outcome, the judge and trustee assigned to each
9:302:25480:17:16:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filing, whether the filing includes any assets, and whether the filing fee was paid immediately or
9:303:25578:16:16:72:540:549:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in installments. The data also contain information on each debtor’s name, address, and last four
9:304:25674:16:17:72:289:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:digits of each debtor’s social security number.
9:305:25721:17:16:88:539:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We make five restrictions to our estimation sample. First, we drop 110 offices that only have
9:306:25814:16:17:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a single Chapter 13 bankruptcy judge, as there is no variation in judge leniency that allows us to
9:307:25912:17:16:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate the impact of Chapter 13 protection. Second, we drop all filings originating from counties
9:308:26011:16:17:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that assign all cases to a single judge, as these filings are not randomly assigned. Third, we drop
9:309:26110:17:16:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:office by year bins where a retiring judge’s cases were reassigned with no documentation as to the
9:310:26208:16:17:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:original judge. Fourth, we drop office by year by judge bins with fewer than ten cases. Finally, we
9:311:26307:17:16:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrict the sample to first-time filers between 1992 and 2005 to ensure that we have five or more
9:312:26405:16:16:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:years of post-filing outcomes for all debtors and that all filings occurred before the 2005 Bankruptcy
9:313:26507:16:17:72:209:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Reform Act came into effect.
9:314:26535:17:16:88:539:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These sample restrictions leave us with 534,980 Chapter 13 filings in 42 offices and 31 bankruptcy
9:315:26633:16:17:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:courts. These data represent just over 26 percent of the available Chapter 13 filings in the analysis
9:316:26734:17:16:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:period. The final sample includes 314 office by year observations, 112 office by judge observations,
9:317:26834:16:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 758 office-year-judge observations. The number of cases in each office-year-judge bin ranges
9:318:26930:17:16:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from 13 to 3,423. The median number of cases in each office-year-judge bin is 1,048. Appendix
9:319:27023:16:16:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 1 provides additional details on each of the offices in our estimation sample. Appendix Figures
9:320:27124:16:17:72:484:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3 and 4 display the distribution of office-year-judge bins and office-year-judge leniency.
9:321:27214:17:16:88:539:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To explore the impact of bankruptcy protection on subsequent labor supply and mortality, we
9:322:27305:16:17:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:matched the bankruptcy records to administrative tax records from the SSA. The SSA data are
9:323:27396:17:16:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:remarkably complete and include every individual who has ever acquired a SSN, including those
9:324:27489:16:17:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who are institutionalized. Illegal immigrants without a valid SSN are not included in these data.
9:325:27586:17:16:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Information on earnings and employment comes from annual W-2s. Individuals with no W-2 in any
9:326:27679:16:17:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular year are assumed to have had no earnings in that year. Individuals with zero earnings
9:327:27775:17:16:72:540:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are included in all regressions throughout the paper. All dollar amounts are in terms of year 2000
9:328:27873:16:16:72:106:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dollars.
9:329:27881:16:17:88:539:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We measure non-earnings outcomes using data from three sources. Information on annual 401k
9:330:27971:17:16:72:540:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contributions, job location, and firm characteristics comes from annual W-2s. Information on DI
9:331:28066:16:17:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and SSI receipt comes from the Master Beneficiary Record. Information on mortality comes from
9:332:28159:17:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Death Master File that is compiled by the SSA, and covers deaths occurring anywhere in the
10:333:28254:0:17:72:140:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:United States.
10:334:28268:17:16:88:539:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We match the bankruptcy data to the SSA records using last name and the last four digits of the
10:335:28363:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filer’s social security number. We were able to successfully match 91.6 percent of the bankruptcy
10:336:28460:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:records, with nearly all of the unmatched records resulting from a shared name and last four digits
10:337:28559:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the social security number in the SSA data. The probability of being matched to the SSA data

10:342:28956:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:files include information on the most recent county assessment, pre-foreclosure notices, and all
10:343:29052:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:home transactions.  The DataQuick files are compiled by county and year, with more complete

10:354:30047:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with previous research on bankruptcy filers, 98.4 percent of Chapter 7 filers in our data are granted
10:355:30148:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection, compared to 48.8 percent of Chapter 13 filers. Sixty percent of Chapter 7
10:356:30244:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers are male, 74.2 percent are white, and 13.3 percent are black. For Chapter 13, 63.4 percent of
10:357:30344:17:16:72:385:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers are male, 55.8 percent are white, and 33.9 percent are black.

10:359:30507:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before filing, 80.6 percent of Chapter 7 filers are employed on average, with average annual earnings
10:360:30608:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of just $21,090. Eighty percent of Chapter 13 filers are employed, earning $22,333 annually in the
10:361:30706:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:five years before filing. Over the same five year time period, 4.7 percent of Chapter 7 filers receive
10:362:30808:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:DI, and 9.7 percent receive SSI. Just over four percent of Chapter 13 filers receive DI, and 8.4
10:363:30904:17:16:72:165:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent receive SSI.

10:366:31111:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 filers in our sample are granted bankruptcy protection, 4.0 percentage points less than
10:367:31209:16:31:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the full sample. Sixty point nine percent of filers in our sample are male, 2.5 percentage points less
10:368:31311:31:15:87:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5Filers are classified as homeowners if they list real property on Schedule A of the bankruptcy form. The Chapter
10:369:31424:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:13 homeownership rate was provided directly by the authors. There is also evidence that the fraction of Chapter
10:370:31535:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:13 filers who are homeowners has increased in recent years. Lawless et al. (2008) find that 69.6 percent of Chapter
10:371:31650:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:13 filers are homeowners in a random sample of filers in 2007, with other, more selected survey samples suggesting
10:372:31764:11:0:72:523:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:homeownership rates of between 70 and 96 percent in the post-2005 period (White and Zhu 2010, Porter 2011).

11:374:31973:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average firm wages are $3,874 higher. Conversely, filers in our estimation sample are statistically
11:375:32072:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indistinguishable from the full sample with regard to age, ethnic background, employment, earnings,

11:379:32302:27:16:71:539:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we motivate our empirical analysis by describing a simple model of how consumer
11:380:32398:16:17:71:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy functions as a social insurance mechanism. The model illustrates the trade-off between
11:381:32495:17:16:71:539:549:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the consumption smoothing benefits provided by bankruptcy protection with the increased borrow-
11:382:32590:16:17:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing costs that result from the higher risk of default. We then consider how the estimates of the
11:383:32686:17:31:71:500:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect of bankruptcy protection on labor supply can shed light on those benefits and costs.

11:390:33275:17:16:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there are no other direct or indirect costs of bankruptcy, and that all agents eligible for bankruptcy

11:395:33676:16:16:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection. In the next section, we allow agents to choose labor supply to show how

11:412:34399:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:simplify the model by assuming that agents only face expense risk that is unlikely to be covered by existing social
11:413:34514:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:insurance mechanisms, such as Unemployment Insurance. Our model is therefore unable to shed light on the interac-

12:474:36505:17:16:88:539:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Equation (4) highlights the trade-off between the consumption smoothing benefits provided by

12:477:36790:16:17:72:540:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the effect of consumer bankruptcy on welfare using quantitative models of the credit market (e.g.

12:479:36977:16:17:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2012). An important limitation of this literature has been the lack of empirical evidence on the
12:480:37073:17:16:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:magnitude of both the benefits provided by bankruptcy protection for the marginal recipient and
12:481:37168:16:16:72:540:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the costs associated with more expensive borrowing. There is also relatively little information on the
12:482:37270:16:17:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mechanisms through which bankruptcy protection benefits debtors, forcing the previous literature
12:483:37366:17:16:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to make strong assumptions, such as abstracting away from the production side of the economy (e.g.
12:484:37464:16:17:72:540:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Athreya 2002, Livshits, MacGee, and Tertilt 2007), assuming that labor supply is only influenced
12:485:37560:17:16:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by the aggregate capital stock (e.g. Li and Sarte 2006), or assuming that labor supply is extremely
12:486:37659:16:0:72:282:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inelastic (e.g. Chatterjee and Gordon 2012).

13:488:37735:23:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, we consider how estimates of the impact of bankruptcy protection on labor supply shed
13:489:37826:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:light on the benefits and costs of the consumer bankruptcy system as described by equation (4).
13:490:37921:16:17:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the simple setup described above, bankruptcy protection unambiguously decreases labor supply
13:491:38016:17:16:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through both substitution and wealth effects. However, the assumption that agents fully repay their
13:492:38115:16:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debts outside of the bankruptcy system is unlikely to hold in practice given that the majority of
13:493:38212:17:16:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debt write-offs occur outside of the bankruptcy system (Hynes, Dawsey, and Ausubel 2009). We
13:494:38304:16:17:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:therefore make the more realistic assumption that agents who do not receive bankruptcy protection
13:495:38401:17:16:72:539:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:default on their debt and are subject to wage garnishment at rateαg. The wage garnishment rate
13:496:38495:16:16:72:539:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is assumed to be larger than the bankruptcy repayment rateαg> αb, implying that bankruptcy
13:497:38585:16:17:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection reduces the implicit tax on earnings associated with default. We also assume that the

13:515:39430:16:17:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect associated with the reduced tax on earnings dominates. Conversely, bankruptcy protection
13:516:39525:17:16:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decreases the earnings of the marginal recipient if the marginal non-recipient is not subject to wage
13:517:39626:16:17:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment or the wealth effect dominates. The effect of bankruptcy protection on labor supply is
13:518:39724:17:16:72:222:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:therefore an empirical question.
13:519:39756:16:17:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Labor supply estimates for the marginal recipient of bankruptcy protection influence the benefits
13:520:39853:17:16:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and costs of the consumer bankruptcy system in at least two ways. First, any labor supply response
13:521:39951:16:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will change the consumption smoothing benefits provided by bankruptcy protection. If bankruptcy
13:522:40046:16:17:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection increases the marginal recipient’s earnings, the difference between consumption of the
13:523:40143:17:16:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal filer and marginal non-filer is increased, as are the consumption smoothing benefits of
13:524:40239:16:17:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection. The reverse holds if bankruptcy has a negative impact on debtor earnings.
13:525:40335:17:16:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, any labor supply response will change the sensitivity of borrowing costs to bankruptcy
13:526:40429:16:17:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy and the costs associated with bankruptcy protection.  If bankruptcy protection increases
13:527:40524:17:16:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the marginal recipient’s earnings, the difference in the amount repaid to creditors by the marginal
13:528:40623:16:16:72:540:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filer and marginal non-filer is reduced, decreasing the sensitivity of borrowing costs to bankruptcy
13:529:40723:16:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policy and lowering the cost of the bankruptcy system. The reverse again holds if bankruptcy has
14:530:40821:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a negative impact on debtor earnings. Thus, a positive (negative) impact of bankruptcy protection
14:531:40918:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on earnings suggests that the bankruptcy system has larger (smaller) benefits and smaller (larger)
14:532:41016:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:costs than implied by models with inelastic labor supply (e.g. Athreya 2002, Livshits, MacGee, and

14:539:41484:17:16:71:540:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is that OLS estimates ofγmay be biased if bankruptcy protection is correlated with the unobservable

14:545:42013:16:17:71:539:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for bankruptcy protection. Intuitively, we compare the post-filings outcomes of debtors assigned
14:546:42109:17:16:71:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to bankruptcy judges that have different propensities to grant Chapter 13 protection, interpreting

14:549:42344:16:16:88:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Formally, we estimate the causal impact of receiving bankruptcy protection through a two-stage

14:557:42903:24:15:87:539:163:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7In a model with endogenous borrowing, the consumer bankruptcy system increases loan demand through lower
14:558:43008:15:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:costs of default and improved risk sharing. Borrowing distortions from the lower costs of default are likely increasing
14:559:43127:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:with the benefits of filing for bankruptcy protection. As the benefits of bankruptcy protection are increasing with
14:560:43242:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the magnitude of the labor supply estimates, the distortions to borrowing behavior are also likely to be increasing
14:561:43357:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:with the magnitude of the labor supply estimates. Severino, Brown, and Coates (2014) provide more direct evidence

14:564:43696:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:are consistent with the consumer bankruptcy system increasing borrowing through improved risk sharing, without

15:569:44182:17:16:71:539:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:first and second stage regressions. Results are qualitatively similar if we cluster at the office by
15:570:44282:16:17:71:254:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:judge or office by month-of-filing level.
15:571:44323:17:16:88:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Using an exhaustive set of judge fixed effects as an instrument for bankruptcy protection yields

15:573:44514:17:16:71:539:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:biased in finite samples.  This bias is the result of the mechanical correlation between a filer’s
15:574:44612:16:16:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:own outcomes and the estimation of that filer’s judge fixed effects.  There are several potential
15:575:44709:16:17:71:539:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:solutions to this own-observation issue. Jackknife IV eliminates the bias by omitting a filer’s own
15:576:44808:17:16:71:539:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observation when forming the instrument (Angrist, Imbens, and Krueger 1999). Split-sample two-

15:578:44996:17:16:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using judge tendencies in one part of the sample as an instrument for bankruptcy protection in the
15:579:45094:16:17:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other part of the sample (Angrist and Krueger 1995). Limited information maximum likelihood
15:580:45185:17:16:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(LIML) eliminates the own-observation bias by collapsing the parameter space and using maximum
15:581:45279:16:16:71:451:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likelihood to obtain a consistent estimate of the effect of bankruptcy protection.
15:582:45361:16:17:88:539:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We address the own-observation problem by using a leave-one-out measure of judge leniency as

15:617:47086:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:instruments for bankruptcy protection. The results are qualitatively similar to our preferred estimates presented in
15:618:47202:10:0:72:105:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Table 4.
16:619:47212:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discharge rates, with each point representing a separate judge by year observation. Discharge rates
16:620:47311:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are highly correlated across time, with an OLS regression relating each judge by year discharge
16:621:47406:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate to the lagged discharge rate yielding a coefficient of 0.814. These results suggest that we are
16:622:47506:17:16:72:462:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capturing systematic differences in judge behavior, not random year to year noise.
16:623:47588:16:17:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In contrast to Chapter 13, there is almost no variation in the treatment of Chapter 7 cases across
16:624:47686:17:16:72:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:judges within an office. The standard deviation ofZijctfor Chapter 7 filers is only 0.003 in our
16:625:47782:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data, likely because almost all Chapter 7 filings are granted. This lack of variation makes it difficult
16:626:47886:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to measure the effect of Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection using our instrumental variables strategy.
16:627:47985:16:16:72:522:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Section VE, we use an event study strategy to estimate the impact of Chapter 7 protection.

16:631:48360:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are altered by judge assignment. The conditions necessary to interpret these two-stage least squares
16:632:48460:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates as the causal impact of Chapter 13 protection are: (1) that judge assignment is associated
16:633:48560:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with bankruptcy protection, (2) that judge assignment only impacts debtor outcomes through the
16:634:48654:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of receiving bankruptcy protection, and (3) that the impact of judge assignment on the
16:635:48752:16:17:72:416:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of receiving bankruptcy protection is monotonic across filers.
16:636:48826:17:16:88:539:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The first assumption is empirically testable. Figure 1 plots average discharge vs. our leave-
16:637:48919:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one-out measure of judge leniency. The estimation sample includes first-time filers between 1992
16:638:49015:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 2005 in the 42 offices in the 31 courts that randomly assign Chapter 13 filings to judges.
16:639:49109:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To construct the plot, we calculate mean residuals from a regression of an indicator for receiving
16:640:49207:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 protection on office by month-of-filing fixed effects. We then add the mean discharge rate
16:641:49308:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the mean residual in each judge by year bin to aid in the interpretation of the scale. The resulting
16:642:49411:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:scatter plot provides a non-parametric representation of the conditional expectation function, but
16:643:49509:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:does not show the underlying variance in the individual-level data. The solid line and corresponding
16:644:49609:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coefficient show the best linear fit estimated on the underlying individual-level data, controlling for
16:645:49712:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:office by month-of-filing fixed effects and with standard errors clustered at the office level. Table 2
16:646:49815:16:17:72:465:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presents analogous individual-level estimates with and without additional controls.
16:647:49898:17:16:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:First stage results from Figure 1 and Table 2 show a large and precisely estimated relationship
16:648:49993:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between judge leniency and the probability of receiving bankruptcy protection. With no filer level
16:649:50091:17:16:72:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controls, a one percentage point increase inZijctincreases the probability that a debtor receives
16:650:50188:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection by 0.749 percentage points. Controlling for gender, race, age, and baseline

16:652:50382:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection by 0.731 percentage points. Thus, a one standard deviation (three percentage
16:653:50480:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point) increase in judge leniency increases the likelihood of receiving Chapter 13 bankruptcy protec-
16:654:50581:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion by about 2.2 percentage points, a 4.9 percent change from the mean. To put these magnitudes
16:655:50677:16:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in perspective, black filers are 9.0 percentage points less likely to receive bankruptcy protection, a

16:657:50882:16:0:72:346:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$10,000 lower are about 0.05 percentage points less likely.
17:658:50943:0:17:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The probability of receiving Chapter 13 protection does not increase one-for-one with our mea-
17:659:51037:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sure of judge leniency, likely because of measurement error that attenuates the effect toward zero.
17:660:51136:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For instance, judge leniency may drift over the course of the year or fluctuate with case character-
17:661:51236:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:istics, reducing the accuracy of our leave-one-out measure. Nevertheless, the results from Figure 1
17:662:51335:16:17:72:442:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Table 2 confirm that judge leniency is highly predictive of case outcomes.
17:663:51413:17:16:88:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our second identifying assumption is that judge assignment only impacts debtor outcomes
17:664:51500:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through the probability of receiving bankruptcy protection.  This assumption would be violated
17:665:51594:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if judge leniency is correlated with unobservable determinants of future outcomes. Table 3 presents
17:666:51693:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a series of randomization checks to partially assess the validity of this exclusion restriction. Column

17:672:52300:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:associated with judge leniency at the ten percent level. None of our other baseline variables are sig-

17:680:52962:16:16:88:539:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 4 presents results from our final test of random assignment. We regress each baseline
17:681:53054:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure on an exhaustive set of judge fixed effects. Each regression controls for office by month-
17:682:53152:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of-filing fixed effects. We report the p-value from a joint F-test that the judge effects are jointly
17:683:53253:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:different than zero, which provides an omnibus test for the null hypothesis that filer covariates do not
17:684:53357:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:differ significantly among filers assigned to judges within an office by month-of-filing combination.
17:685:53458:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The joint F-test for age has a p-value of 0.051. None of the other joint F-tests in column 4 suggest
17:686:53558:17:16:72:394:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that there is systematic non-random assignment of filings to judges.
17:687:53626:16:17:88:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The exclusion restriction could also be violated if judge leniency impacts future outcomes through
17:688:53724:17:19:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:channels other than bankruptcy protection. For example, the exclusion restriction would be violated
17:689:53823:19:15:87:539:196:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:9To put the magnitude of the age and tenure correlations in Table 3 in context, we compare the implied bias
17:690:53930:15:11:72:540:181:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in our reduced form earnings results reported in Section VA. Controlling only for office by month fixed effects, an
17:691:54045:11:11:72:540:170:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:OLS regression of average earnings over the first five post-filing earnings on age suggests that being a year older
17:692:54160:11:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:is associated with earnings that are $176.86 lower. Controlling for all of the covariates listed in Table 3, being a
17:693:54276:11:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:year older is associated with earnings that are $252.70 lower. An additional year of job tenure is associated with
17:694:54390:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:earnings that are $1,917.81 higher when controlling only for office by month fixed effects, and $1,265.64 higher when
17:695:54507:11:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:controlling for all other covariates in Table 3. Thus, a one standard deviation (three percentage point) increase in
17:696:54623:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:judge leniency is associated with a -$0.000037 to $0.000037 change in earnings due to the differences in age observed
17:697:54740:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in Table 3, and a $0.002885 to $0.004430 change in earnings due to the differences in job tenure observed in Table 3.
17:698:54857:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:In contrast, our reduced form results plotted in Figure 3 show that a one percentage point increase in judge leniency
17:699:54974:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:is associated with a $128.55 increase in post-filing earnings. Results are similar for employment, mortality, and home

18:701:55106:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if more lenient judges are also more likely to provide financial counseling to debtors, and that
18:702:55202:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:financial counseling has an independent impact on future outcomes.  If judge leniency impacts
18:703:55295:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:future outcomes through any other channels, then the resulting local average treatment effect would
18:704:55394:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incorporate any additional impacts associated with judge assignment. The assumption that judges
18:705:55489:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only systematically affect debtor outcomes through bankruptcy is fundamentally untestable, and
18:706:55583:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our estimates should be interpreted with this potential caveat in mind. However, we argue that this
18:707:55682:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exclusion assumption is reasonable in our setting. Recall that bankruptcy judges typically interact
18:708:55781:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with debtors only at the confirmation hearing, while the separately assigned court trustee handles
18:709:55879:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all pre- and post-filing issues. Thus, it seems unlikely that judges would confer significant benefits
18:710:55981:16:17:72:394:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to debtors other than through their ruling on the bankruptcy filing.
18:711:56049:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our third identifying assumption is that there is a monotonic impact of judge assignment on the
18:712:56144:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of receiving bankruptcy protection. The monotonicity assumption implies that being
18:713:56238:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assigned to a more (less) lenient judge does not result in a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of
18:714:56339:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:receiving bankruptcy protection. This monotonicity assumption would be violated if judges differ
18:715:56435:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the types of filings they treat more leniently. For example, the monotonicity assumption would
18:716:56532:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be invalid if some judges treat women more leniently, while other judges do not treat women more
18:717:56628:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leniently. If the monotonicity assumption is violated, our estimates from equation (8) would still be
18:718:56729:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a weighted average of marginal treatment effects, but the weights would not sum to one (Angrist,
18:719:56825:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Imbens, and Rubin 1996, Heckman and Vytlacil 2005). The monotonicity assumption is therefore
18:720:56917:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:necessary to interpret our estimates as a well defined local average treatment effect. The bias away
18:721:57017:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from this local average treatment effect is an increasing function of the number of individuals for
18:722:57116:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whom the monotonicity assumption does not hold and the difference in the marginal treatment
18:723:57207:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects for those individuals for whom the monotonicity assumption does and does not hold. The
18:724:57301:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amount of bias is also a decreasing function of the first stage relationship described by equation (9)

18:726:57439:16:17:88:539:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To partially test the monotonicity assumption, Appendix Figure 5 plots judge leniency measures
18:727:57533:17:16:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that are calculated separately for each judge by gender, race, baseline income, age, and home
18:728:57626:16:17:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ownership. We also report the coefficient and standard error from an OLS regression relating each
18:729:57723:17:16:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure of judge leniency. Consistent with our monotonicity assumption, judges exhibit remarkably
18:730:57820:16:17:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar tendencies across observably different filers. Regressing the judge leniency for male filers on
18:731:57923:17:16:71:539:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those for female filers yields a point estimate of 0.838. For white and non-white filers, the point
18:732:58022:16:16:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate is 1.005, for high and low baseline earnings the coefficient is 0.998, for filers older and
18:733:58122:16:17:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:younger than 40 the coefficient is 1.104, and for those matched to a home and those not matched
18:734:58217:17:16:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to a home the coefficient is 0.889. None of the results suggest that the monotonicity assumption is
18:735:58316:16:53:71:173:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:invalid in our setting.

19:743:58815:17:16:72:540:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:analysis of granted and dismissed filers. Figure 2 plots average pre- and post-filing earnings and
19:744:58913:16:16:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employment for our estimation sample. Earnings include both wage and self-employment earnings
19:745:59006:16:17:72:540:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:including zeros.11To aid in the interpretation of the results, we plot expected outcomes calculated
19:746:59105:17:16:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using a regression of the outcome five years before filing on controls for gender, race, a quadratic
19:747:59205:16:17:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in age, a quadratic in tenure, industry fixed effects, and earnings in the previous five years. We
19:748:59303:17:16:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:then predict the outcome for the four years before filing and the five years after filing using age and
19:749:59406:16:17:72:160:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tenure coefficients.
19:750:59426:17:16:88:539:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Filers granted Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection earn $5,000 to $5,500 more than dismissed
19:751:59515:16:16:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers in the years leading up to filing.  Earnings for both groups fall two to three years before
19:752:59613:16:17:72:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filing, with a larger dip for dismissed filers.12The post-filing earnings of dismissed filers dip further,
19:753:59719:17:16:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:falling about $4,000 below the expected trajectory five years after filing. In contrast to the large
19:754:59819:16:17:72:540:449:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and permanent decline in earnings experienced by dismissed filers, individuals granted bankruptcy
19:755:59916:17:16:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection appear to have no long-term earnings losses. These descriptive trends suggest that any
19:756:60013:16:17:72:540:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:causal impacts of bankruptcy protection are likely to be driven by the deterioration of outcomes
19:757:60109:17:16:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:among dismissed filers, as opposed to gains by granted filers.  This interpretation suggests that
19:758:60206:16:17:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection mitigates the long-term consequences of financial shocks that might otherwise
19:759:60305:17:16:72:464:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:harm debtors, but does not confer any benefits in the absence of a financial shock.

19:762:60580:17:16:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 1, we construct each plot by regressing each outcome on office by month-of-filing fixed effects,
19:763:60683:16:17:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculating residuals, and then adding the mean outcome to each residual to facilitate interpretation
19:764:60784:17:16:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the scale. The solid line and corresponding coefficient show the best linear fit estimated on the

19:767:61013:16:16:88:539:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 3 shows that being assigned to a more lenient judge significantly increases post-filing
19:768:61107:16:17:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings and employment.  A one standard deviation (three percentage point) increase in judge
19:769:61200:17:28:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leniency increases post-filing earnings by $128.55 relative to the baseline mean of $22,115. Employ-

19:771:61405:15:11:72:540:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:earnings with and without zeros included.  Median earnings are lower than mean earnings for both granted and
19:772:61513:11:11:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:dismissed filers, but the same qualitative trends exist before and after filing as in Figure 2.  Mean and median
19:773:61625:11:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:earnings without zeros included also follow the same trend as Figure 2.  Two-stage least squares estimates that

19:775:61835:7:15:83:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12The fall in pre-filing earnings is likely related to the “Ashenfelter dip” – the drop in earnings among participants
19:776:61953:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in job training programs – discussed by Ashenfelter (1978), Ashenfelter and Card (1985), and Heckman and Hotz

20:788:63082:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the years prior to the baseline year under consideration. Standard errors are clustered at the office
20:789:63183:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level throughout. We estimate the impact of bankruptcy protection for each year separately. Table
20:790:63280:17:16:72:428:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:4 presents estimates pooling outcomes across the first five post-filing years.
20:791:63358:16:17:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a large and precisely estimated impact of Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on post-
20:792:63450:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filing earnings and employment. In the first full year after filing, the marginal recipient of Chapter 13
20:793:63555:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection earns $6,228 more than the marginal dismissed filer. The impact of Chapter 13 protection
20:794:63654:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:remains both economically and statistically significant for the first five post-filing years. Pooling
20:795:63755:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes across those five years, the marginal recipient of Chapter 13 earns $5,562 more than the
20:796:63852:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal dismissed filer, a 25.1 percent increase from the baseline mean. The earnings estimates
20:797:63948:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported in Table 4 are similar to those suggested by the descriptive trends in Figure 2, and formal
20:798:64048:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:event study estimates presented in Section VE. Conversely, our two-stage least squares estimates
20:799:64144:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are considerably larger than cross-sectional (e.g.  Han and Li 2007, 2011) and within-individual
20:800:64240:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates (e.g. Cohen-Cole, Duygan-Bump and Montoriol-Garriga 2009) that do not use dismissed
20:801:64333:17:16:72:208:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers as a comparison group.
20:802:64362:16:16:88:539:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Over the first five post-filing years, Chapter 13 also increases employment by 6.8 percentage
20:803:64455:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points, a 8.3 percent increase from the baseline mean. This point estimate suggests that approx-
20:804:64551:17:16:72:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imately($22,115·6.8) = $1,503, or 27 percent, of the earnings estimate can be explained by a
20:805:64643:16:17:72:232:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decline in labor force attachment.
20:806:64677:17:16:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our two-stage least squares estimates can only be interpreted as the causal effect of bankruptcy
20:807:64773:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection if judge leniency is not systematically related to unobserved filer characteristics. One way
20:808:64876:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to evaluate the validity of this assumption is to a estimate the impact of bankruptcy protection in
20:809:64975:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the years before a debtor files. Consistent with our identifying assumptions discussed above, there
20:810:65074:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is no systematic relationship between bankruptcy protection and either earnings or employment in
20:811:65170:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the pre-filing years, with the estimated coefficients being economically and statistically insignificant.
20:812:65275:16:17:88:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Table 2 presents estimates using a variety of specifications and instruments to assess
20:813:65370:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the robustness of our main results. Column 2 replicates our preferred estimates from Table 4 using
20:814:65468:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leave-one-out judge leniency as an instrument for Chapter 13 protection. Column 3 uses a leave-
20:815:65563:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:month-out measure of judge leniency – where we calculate judge leniency only using cases in the
20:816:65658:16:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:11 other months of the filing year – as an instrument for Chapter 13 protection. Measuring judge
20:817:65754:17:16:72:540:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leniency only using cases from the other 11 months purges any remaining correlation between a
20:818:65847:16:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filer’s outcomes and our instrument introduced by the estimation of the office by month-of-filing
21:819:65946:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fixed effects in our first and second stage regressions. Column 4 uses a leave-one-out measure of judge
21:820:66049:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leniency measured over the first 90 post-filing days as an instrument. Column 5 uses a randomly
21:821:66144:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selected subset of 50 percent of filers to calculate a leave-month-out measure of judge leniency that is
21:822:66248:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:used as an instrument in the mutually exclusive subset of filers. Columns 6 through 8 present results
21:823:66349:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that use judge fixed effects as instruments for bankruptcy protection estimated using two-stage least
21:824:66450:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:squares, LIML, and jackknife IV, respectively. All regressions control for gender, race, five-year age
21:825:66552:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effects, a five-year average of baseline employment, a five-year average of baseline earnings, and
21:826:66650:17:16:72:481:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:office by month-of-filing fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the office level.
21:827:66742:16:16:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our two-stage least squares estimates are robust to the choice of instrument and estimation
21:828:66833:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:method. The impact of Chapter 13 protection on post-filing earnings is $5,602 in the leave-month-
21:829:66930:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:out specification, $9,126 in the 90-day judge leniency specification, $4,628 in the split sample spec-
21:830:67032:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ification, $4,445 in the two-stage least squares judge fixed effects specification, $4,263 in the LIML
21:831:67134:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specification, and $4,463 in the jackknife IV specification.  Due to the relatively large standard
21:832:67232:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:errors when using judge fixed effects as instruments, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the es-
21:833:67330:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:timated treatment effects are identical to our preferred estimate of $5,562 for all of our estimates
21:834:67430:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:except the 90-day judge leniency specification. The results follow a similar pattern for employment,
21:835:67530:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:while the mortality and foreclosure results are larger when using judge fixed effects. None of the
21:836:67628:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point estimates for employment, mortality, and foreclosure are statistically distinguishable from our
21:837:67729:16:17:72:276:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:preferred estimates in column 2 of Table 4.
21:838:67772:17:16:88:539:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Table 6 presents two-stage least squares results using our preferred specification for
21:839:67867:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sixth through tenth post-filing years. We restrict the sample to filings originating between 1992
21:840:67968:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 2000. Filings originating after 2000 are excluded because we do not observe post-filing outcomes
21:841:68068:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for all ten years for these individuals. In this sample of older filings, Chapter 13 protection increases
21:842:68173:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the marginal recipient’s annual earnings by $6,772 in the sixth through tenth post-filing years. These
21:843:68275:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results suggest that the impact of bankruptcy protection is persistent after the completion of the
21:844:68373:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:repayment plan. The probability of being employed is also 6.6 percentage points higher in the sixth
21:845:68472:17:16:72:220:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through tenth post-filing years.
21:846:68504:16:17:88:539:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 5 presents two-stage least squares results from our preferred specification separately by
21:847:68599:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filer gender, race, age, baseline earnings, and being matched to a home. The effects of Chapter 13
21:848:68697:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection on annual earnings are somewhat larger for female and non-white filers, though neither
21:849:68794:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:difference is statistically significant. There are significantly larger impacts of Chapter 13 protec-
21:850:68895:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion on younger filers, likely because older filers in our sample have already left the labor market.
21:851:68996:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Specifically, Chapter 13 increases the annual earnings of filers who are 25 to 40 years old by $7,833
21:852:69097:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the annual earnings of filers who are 40 and 60 years old by $6,299, while having no discernible
21:853:69197:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect on filers who are 60 or older at the time of filing. Chapter 13 protection also has a larger
21:854:69296:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact on filers with above median earnings. Chapter 13 increases annual earnings by $8,650 for
21:855:69391:16:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers with above median earnings, compared to an increase of $1,691 for filers with below median
21:856:69488:17:16:72:540:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings. The impact of Chapter 13 protection on employment is also 6.0 percentage points higher
21:857:69584:16:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for filers with above median baseline earnings. This may be the result of higher earning filers facing
22:858:69688:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a higher marginal rate of garnishment, or non-linearities in the elasticity of labor supply. In Section
22:859:69791:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:VD, we show that the garnishment channel is at least partially responsible for the pattern of results
22:860:69892:16:17:72:168:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observed in Table 5.
22:861:69912:17:16:88:539:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel D of Table 4 presents results for additional labor supply outcomes available in the SSA
22:862:70005:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data. We estimate the impact of Chapter 13 protection on the average of each outcome over the
22:863:70098:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:first five post-filing years. Among eligible filers, bankruptcy protection decreases the receipt of SSI
22:864:70201:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by 12.8 percentage points, though the point estimate is only significant at the ten percent level.
22:865:70299:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy protection also appears to have little impact on the receipt of DI or on annual 401k

22:868:70420:23:17:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The reduced form estimate of judge leniency on five-year mortality is presented in Figure 3, and the
22:869:70520:17:16:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:corresponding two-stage least squares estimates are presented in Figure 4. The dependent variable
22:870:70617:16:16:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for each regression is an indicator for being deceased in or before the specified year. Trends in the
22:871:70718:16:17:72:239:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raw data are presented in Figure 2.
22:872:70753:17:16:88:539:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the first full year after filing, only 0.3 percent of filers granted Chapter 13 protection are
22:873:70850:16:17:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deceased, compared to 1.15 percent of dismissed filers. Five years after filing, 2.1 percent of filers
22:874:70952:17:16:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:granted Chapter 13 protection are deceased, compared to 4.0 percent of dismissed filers.  These
22:875:71047:16:17:72:540:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistics suggest that dismissed bankruptcy filers have extremely high mortality rates. The annual
22:876:71146:17:16:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality rate for individuals age 25-70 in the United States is about 0.45 percent, one-third to
22:877:71243:16:16:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two-fifths the mortality risk of dismissed filers. The annual mortality rate for a national population
22:878:71345:16:17:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a similar age profile as our estimation sample is 0.3 percent, one-quarter to one-third the
22:879:71441:17:16:72:539:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality risk of dismissed filers (CDC 2014).13The high mortality rates among dismissed filers
22:880:71536:16:17:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are consistent with the high rates of medical debt (Domowitz and Sartain 1999, Sullivan, Warren,
22:881:71632:17:16:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Westbrook 2000, Warren, Sullivan, and Jacoby 2000, Himmelstein et al. 2009) and high levels
22:882:71727:16:17:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of self-reported stress (Porter 2011) among bankruptcy filers. The mortality rates among dismissed
22:883:71825:17:16:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers are also consistent with the high mortality rates reported among displaced workers. Sullivan
22:884:71924:16:17:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and von Watcher (2009) find average annual mortality rates of 0.52 percent among displaced workers
22:885:72022:17:16:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:age 28-57, nearly 30 percent higher than the national mortality rate for similarly aged individuals
22:886:72121:16:16:72:210:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during the same time period.
22:887:72149:16:17:88:539:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Turning to our causal estimates, the reduced form results from Figure 4 show that being assigned
22:888:72245:17:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to a more lenient judge decreases five-year mortality. A one standard deviation increase in judge
22:889:72342:16:17:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leniency decreases five-year mortality by 0.0003 percentage points relative to the dismissed filer
22:890:72440:17:30:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean of 4.0 percentage points.  Note that we use the dismissed filer mean as a reference point
22:891:72534:30:15:83:539:130:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:13The CDC reports the annual population, number of deaths, and mortality rates for five year age groups. We

22:894:72868:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:calculate the mortality rates for the 40 to 59 and 60 to 70 age groups, using the appropriate age groups from the
22:895:72981:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:CDC. We adjust for the age profile of our sample by calculating a weighted average of mortality rates where weights
22:896:73096:10:0:72:340:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:are proportionate to the size of the each age cohort in our sample.

23:904:73770:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality by 1.5 percentage points, though the estimate is not statistically significant. We wish to
23:905:73870:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:emphasize that due to the relative imprecision of our mortality estimates, the 95 percent confidence
23:906:73970:16:17:72:412:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intervals include both very small and implausibly large point estimates.
23:907:74042:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel B of Table 5 reports two-stage least squares results interacted by filer gender, race, age,
23:908:74139:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:baseline earnings, and being matched to a home. The effect of Chapter 13 protection on mortality
23:909:74235:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is larger for filers who are white, have above median baseline earnings, and are not matched to a
23:910:74332:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:home at baseline. However, the most striking pattern is by age. Chapter 13 protection decreases
23:911:74427:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:five-year mortality by 10.9 percentage points for filers 60 and older at the time of filing, despite
23:912:74527:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:having little to no impact on earnings for these filers. In contrast, Chapter 13 decreases five-year
23:913:74627:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality by only 2.2 percentage points for filers between 25 and 40, and 1.7 percentage points for
23:914:74726:17:32:72:189:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers between 40 and 60.

23:918:74966:17:16:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filings in our estimation sample in county by year bins covered by the DataQuick records. Home
23:919:75060:16:17:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:foreclosure is an indicator for a filer’s home receiving a notice of default, receiving a notice of transfer

23:921:75265:16:17:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that we are unable to estimate the impact of bankruptcy protection on pre-filing foreclosure as we
23:922:75363:17:16:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only have address information for the year of filing, and were unable to match pre-filing transactions
23:923:75465:16:17:72:350:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to filers. Trends in the raw data are presented in Figure 2.
23:924:75525:17:16:88:539:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection significantly lowers the probability of home foreclosure. In
23:925:75618:16:16:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the raw data plotted in Figure 2, five-year foreclosure rates are less than 2.5 percent for filers
23:926:75716:16:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:receiving bankruptcy protection, compared to 14.9 percent for dismissed filers. This implies that
23:927:75813:17:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approximately one-third of dismissed filers matched to a home experience a home foreclosure within
23:928:75911:16:17:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the first five post-filing years. Note that we use the dismissed filer mean for reference, as we only
23:929:76012:17:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observe a filer’s address at the time of filing. Because the vast majority of foreclosures result in a
23:930:76114:16:17:72:521:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change of address, we are largely unable to measure the probability of foreclosure before filing.
23:931:76211:17:16:88:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our reduced form results from Figure 3 show that being assigned to a more lenient judge has an
23:932:76305:16:16:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economically and statistically significant effect on post-filing foreclosure. A one standard deviation
23:933:76407:16:17:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase in judge leniency decreases five-year foreclosure by 0.00459 percentage points relative to the
23:934:76510:17:0:72:540:78:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dismissed filer mean of 14.9 percentage points. In the two-stage least squares estimates, Chapter 13
24:935:76612:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection decreases foreclosure by 11.9 percentage points in the first full post-filing year and 16.7
24:936:76714:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points in the second post-filing year. Foreclosure rates are 19.1 percentage points lower
24:937:76814:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:five years after filing, a 127.5 percent decrease from the dismissed filer mean. Conditional on being
24:938:76915:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:matched to a home, Chapter 13 protection decreases five-year home foreclosure by 35.3 percentage
24:939:77011:16:17:72:104:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points.
24:940:77018:17:16:88:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Appendix Table 5, we show that bankruptcy protection also significantly decreases voluntary
24:941:77112:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and short home sales.  Distress sales, which include both foreclosures and short sales, are 22.2
24:942:77208:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points lower after five years. Home sales, which include all types of housing transactions,
24:943:77310:16:16:72:301:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are 33.9 percentage points lower after five years.
24:944:77360:16:17:88:539:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Panel C of Table 5 reports subsample results. The effect of Chapter 13 protection on foreclosure
24:945:77456:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is larger for filers with low baseline earnings and filers who are 60 or older at the time of filing.
24:946:77557:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These results may be due to these filers being more at risk of foreclosure or having fewer alternatives
24:947:77660:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if a bankruptcy filing is dismissed. However, the precise mechanisms for this pattern of results are

24:950:77804:23:17:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why are there such large benefits of receiving bankruptcy protection?  In this section, we first
24:951:77900:17:16:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explore whether protection from wage garnishment and reduced economic instability can explain
24:952:77993:16:17:72:540:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our labor supply results. We then conclude by considering potential explanations for our mortality
24:953:78091:17:16:72:102:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result.
24:954:78098:16:16:88:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One explanation for our results is that Chapter 13 maintains the incentive to work by protecting
24:955:78194:16:17:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:future earnings from wage garnishment. In this scenario, dismissed filers reduce their labor supply
24:956:78293:17:16:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to the tax on earnings imposed by wage garnishment. Table 6 partially tests this hypothesis
24:957:78388:16:17:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by estimating the impact of Chapter 13 protection interacted with proxies of garnishment risk.
24:958:78482:17:16:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 present results for filers in the four states that prohibit wage garnishment
24:959:78585:16:17:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:– Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas – and filers in states that allow at least some
24:960:78683:17:16:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage garnishment. The impact of Chapter 13 on annual earnings over the first five post-filing years
24:961:78782:16:17:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is $5,635 in states that allow garnishment, compared to $3,193 in the four states that prohibit
24:962:78877:17:16:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment. The pattern of results is reversed for employment, however, with larger impacts in
24:963:78972:16:16:72:518:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the four states that prohibit garnishment, though the difference is not statistically significant.
24:964:79070:16:17:88:539:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Columns 3 through 7 exploit both within- and across-state variation in garnishment laws to
24:965:79160:17:16:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate results for filers who are likely to be subject to different marginal garnishment rates.
24:966:79257:16:17:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Within each state, wage garnishments are a non-linear function of earnings. For example, in states
24:967:79355:17:16:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that follow the federal guidelines, creditors are allowed to garnish each additional dollar of disposable
24:968:79460:16:17:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings between 30 and 40 times the minimum wage, but only 25 cents of every additional dollar
24:969:79555:17:16:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after that point. There is also across-state variation in garnishment rates. Twelve states have lower
24:970:79656:16:16:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal garnishment rates, ten have lower caps on the total amount that can be garnished, and
24:971:79750:16:17:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:four states prohibit wage garnishment altogether. In each of these states, the more stringent state
24:972:79849:17:0:72:332:78:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regulation takes precedence over the federal guidelines.
25:973:79907:0:17:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We exploit this variation in garnishment laws by estimating the impact of bankruptcy interacted

25:982:80687:16:16:71:539:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal garnishment rate.  For example,γ250measures the impact of Chapter 13 protection on
25:983:80778:16:17:71:539:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers with higher earnings who are exempt from garnishment in their state of filing, but who would
25:984:80877:17:16:71:539:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have been subject to 25 percent garnishment under federal law, whileγ2525measures the impact of

25:986:81065:17:16:71:539:468:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus,γ250measures the effect of bankruptcy without garnishment protections for higher-earning

25:989:81264:16:16:88:539:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The effect of Chapter 13 protection is small and imprecisely estimated for filers unlikely to

25:1001:82412:16:17:71:539:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:insignificant $7,435. The difference between this estimate and the estimate for filers subject to no
25:1002:82512:17:16:71:539:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment under state law but 100 percent under federal law is marginally significant (p-value
25:1003:82608:16:17:71:539:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:= 0.10).  However, if we take these estimates from columns 4 and 6 at face value, the implied
25:1004:82701:17:20:71:539:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elasticity of earnings with respect to garnishment is about 0.94 for the 25 percent bracket.15All of
25:1005:82801:20:15:83:539:152:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14We estimate disposable earnings using pre-tax earnings in the five most recent pre-filing years and the tax rate
25:1006:82915:15:11:72:540:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:implied by the NBER TAXSIM federal and state income tax calculator. We assume that all filers are the only earner
25:1007:83028:11:7:72:428:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in their households, as we do not observe marital status in the bankruptcy or SSA data.
25:1008:83115:7:15:83:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15The earnings elasticity with respect to garnishment is equal to the log change in taxable earnings divided by the
25:1009:83230:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:log change in the net tax rate. We assume that the state and federal earnings tax rate is 20 percent, implying that
25:1010:83345:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the net tax and garnishment rate is1−(1−0.2)(1−0.25) = 40percent. Finally, we use the impact of bankruptcy
25:1011:83451:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:on filers facing no garnishment in their state of filing who would have faced a 25 percent garnishment under federal
25:1012:83567:11:0:72:540:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:law as a counterfactual impact. These assumptions imply an elasticity of earnings with respect to garnishment of
26:1013:83681:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the results from Table 6 are broadly consistent with bankruptcy protection increasing the incentive
26:1014:83780:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to work by lowering the effective marginal tax rate on earnings. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that
26:1015:83878:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a lower marginal tax rate explains all of our results. Previous studies suggest that the intensive
26:1016:83976:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:marginal elasticity of earnings with respect to the net-of-tax rate is approximately 0.25 (e.g. Chetty
26:1017:84078:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2012), implying that a 25 percent marginal tax cut should increase earnings by about 6.25 percent,
26:1018:84176:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:24.9 percent of our earnings estimate from Table 4. Our implied elasticity measure is likely to be
26:1019:84274:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positively biased by other laws and regulations correlated with wage garnishment policies, such as
26:1020:84372:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrictions on third-party debt collectors. We also note that the standard errors in Table 6 are
26:1021:84469:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large enough that the implied elasticity with respect to earnings includes a wide range of estimates.
26:1022:84570:16:17:88:539:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A second explanation for the estimated effects is that bankruptcy protection maintains economic
26:1023:84665:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stability. Bankruptcy protection discharges most debts, allows debtors to repay mortgage arrears,
26:1024:84762:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and puts a hold on almost all debt collection efforts. These features of the bankruptcy code may
26:1025:84858:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:maintain economic stability by allowing debtors to avoid eviction or home foreclosure, reducing the
26:1026:84957:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incentive to strategically move across state lines or change jobs to avoid creditors, or preventing
26:1027:85056:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sharp drops in consumption that have important long-term consequences. Consistent with this ex-
26:1028:85151:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:planation, our earnings result is of similar magnitude (in the opposite direction) to the estimated
26:1029:85250:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect of job loss (e.g. von Wachter, Song, and Machester 2009), suggesting that bankruptcy pro-
26:1030:85346:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tection may be able to offset the adverse consequences of a financial shock such as job loss. This
26:1031:85444:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interpretation is also consistent with our results from Figure 2, which show a significant deterioration
26:1032:85548:17:16:72:503:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of outcomes among dismissed filers, but few gains for filers granted bankruptcy protection.
26:1033:85639:16:17:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We present further evidence on this issue by examining filer mobility as proxied by firm EIN.
26:1034:85732:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 7 presents estimates of the impact of Chapter 13 protection on the probability of working
26:1035:85827:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the same baseline job, industry, county, and state. We also present results for job tenure and
26:1036:85924:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:average firm wages. The sample is restricted to filers with at least one year of employment in both
26:1037:86023:17:16:72:218:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the pre- and post-filing period.
26:1038:86055:16:17:88:539:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Bankruptcy protection increases the probability of working in the same (2-digit NAICS) indus-
26:1039:86148:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:try by 23.8 percentage points, a 42.7 percent change from the baseline mean of 55.7 percent, and
26:1040:86244:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases the probability that a filer stays at his or her baseline job by 24.6 percentage points, a 49.0
26:1041:86349:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent change from the baseline mean of 50.2 percent. There is also a large impact of bankruptcy
26:1042:86446:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection on geographic mobility, with bankruptcy protection increasing the probability that a filer
26:1043:86547:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:works in his or her baseline county by 22.9 percentage points, a 39.7 percent increase, and his or her
26:1044:86649:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:baseline state by 15.3 percentage points, a 24.4 percent increase. Job tenure and average firm wages
26:1045:86749:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are also higher, suggesting that this increase in economic stability is beneficial for the worker. In
26:1046:86850:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Table 7, we find some evidence that the mobility estimates are larger in states that allow
26:1047:86949:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:garnishment, though not all of the differences are statistically significant. The estimated impacts
26:1048:87048:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also tend to increase with the marginal garnishment bracket, though the differences are not statis-
26:1049:87147:16:29:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tically significant and the estimated effects remain relatively large in the no garnishment bracket.

26:1052:87386:9:0:72:229:72:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:percent bracket, aslog(0)is undefined.
27:1053:87426:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Taken together with the foreclosure results, we interpret this pattern of results as suggesting that
27:1054:87526:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 13 protection maintains economic stability both by reducing forced moves from evictions
27:1055:87621:16:17:72:382:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and foreclosures and unforced, strategic moves to avoid creditors.
27:1056:87687:17:16:88:539:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We conclude this section by considering potential explanations for our mortality results.  In
27:1057:87780:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a sample of Pennsylvania workers, Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) find that job displacement
27:1058:87872:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases five-year mortality by 1.2 percentage points. Thus, one potential interpretation of our
27:1059:87969:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates is that bankruptcy protection can offset much of the increased mortality risk from financial
27:1060:88071:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:distress caused by events such as job loss.  To partially test the hypothesis that the change in
27:1061:88167:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality that we estimate is driven by a change in earnings, we follow Sullivan and von Wachter
27:1062:88263:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2009) and compare our two-stage least squares results for five-year mortality to the effect implied by
27:1063:88366:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the cross-sectional correlation between five-year mortality and both earnings and employment in our
27:1064:88465:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimation sample. Our two-stage least squares results suggest that bankruptcy protection increases
27:1065:88564:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:annual earnings by $5,562 and employment by 6.8 percentage points. In a regression with post-
27:1066:88657:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filing earnings, employment, and no additional controls, the estimated correlation between five-year
27:1067:88757:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mortality and average annual earnings (in $1,000s) is -0.00019, and the correlation between five-
27:1068:88854:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year mortality and average employment is -0.00996. Taken together, these results suggest that the
27:1069:88951:16:17:72:539:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f9:change in labor supply associated with Chapter 13 protection can explain a(0.068·0.00996+5.562·
27:1070:89046:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:0.00019)·100 = 0.17percentage point decrease in five-year mortality, or about 14.1 percent of our
27:1071:89143:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimated treatment effect of 1.2 percentage points. This result is in stark contrast to Sullivan and
27:1072:89244:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:von Wachter (2009), who find that approximately 50 to 75 percent of the impact of job displacement
27:1073:89342:16:17:72:365:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on mortality is driven by the reduction in long-term earnings.
27:1074:89404:17:16:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Further evidence that the change in earnings associated with bankruptcy protection plays little
27:1075:89499:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to no role in explaining the mortality results comes from our subsample results reported in Panel
27:1076:89596:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B of Table 5. Recall that Chapter 13 protection decreases five-year mortality by 10.9 percentage
27:1077:89692:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:points for filers 60 and older at the time of filing, despite having little to no impact on earnings for
27:1078:89796:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these filers. In contrast, Chapter 13 decreases five-year mortality by only 2.2 percentage points for
27:1079:89897:17:16:72:452:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers between 25 and 40, and 1.7 percentage points for filers between 40 and 60.
27:1080:89978:16:17:88:539:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are several potentially relevant channels for our mortality result that we cannot examine
27:1081:90073:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with our current data.  For example, bankruptcy protection may decrease an individual’s stress
27:1082:90167:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by reducing contact with creditors and allowing greater control over his or her financial future.
27:1083:90264:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Consistent with this idea, 84 percent of debtors report being under extreme stress before filing for
27:1084:90364:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy, while only 35 percent report being under extreme stress after filing for bankruptcy
27:1085:90459:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Porter 2011). Dismissed filers may also lose their health insurance or change family environments
27:1086:90557:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in a way that impacts health. Unfortunately, it is not possible to link information on morbidity,
27:1087:90654:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:health insurance, or family status to our data. The precise mechanisms for our estimated mortality
27:1088:90752:17:0:72:456:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:effect therefore remain unclear, and likely include a combination of these factors.
28:1089:90837:0:23:257:355:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:E. External Validity
28:1090:90857:23:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we discuss the external validity of our results for Chapter 13 filers in our estimation
28:1091:90961:17:16:72:382:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample, Chapter 13 filers in our full sample, and Chapter 7 filers.
28:1092:91028:16:17:88:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One potential caveat of our results is that we estimate the effects of Chapter 13 protection for
28:1093:91124:17:16:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the marginal recipient of bankruptcy protection. Recall that our instrumental variable identification
28:1094:91225:16:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy identifies the impact of Chapter 13 for filers whose bankruptcy decision is altered by judge
28:1095:91326:17:16:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assignment due to disagreement on whether or not they should receive bankruptcy protection. This
28:1096:91422:16:17:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:local average treatment effect may or may not reflect the average treatment effect of bankruptcy for
28:1097:91522:17:16:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all filers. To investigate heterogeneous treatment effects across unobservable debtor characteristics,
28:1098:91624:16:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we estimate MTEs (Heckman and Vytlacil 2005). In our setting, the MTE estimates illustrate how
28:1099:91718:16:17:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the outcomes for debtors on the margin of bankruptcy protection change as we move from more
28:1100:91809:17:16:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strict to more lenient judges. Thus, the MTE estimates shed light on the types of filers who benefit
28:1101:91909:16:17:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most from bankruptcy protection, and whether our local average treatment effects are likely to
28:1102:92003:17:16:72:299:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:apply to filers who are further from the margin.
28:1103:92051:16:17:88:539:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To calculate the MTE function, we follow Doyle (2007) and predict the probability of bankruptcy

28:1105:92243:16:16:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predict the relationship between each outcome and the predicted probability of receiving bankruptcy
28:1106:92342:16:17:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection using a local quadratic estimator with a bandwidth of 0.069.16The first derivative of this
28:1107:92443:17:16:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relationship is then evaluated at each percentile of the predicted probability of receiving bankruptcy
28:1108:92545:16:17:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:protection using the coefficients from the local quadratic regression. We calculate standard errors
28:1109:92644:17:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using the standard deviation of MTE estimates from a bootstrap procedure with 250 iterations

28:1111:92796:17:16:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Figure 11 reports the MTE of Chapter 13 protection for earnings, employment, five-
28:1112:92887:16:16:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year mortality, and five-year home foreclosure. The MTE function for earnings is increasing in the
28:1113:92985:16:17:72:540:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predicted probability of bankruptcy protection, while the MTE function for mortality and home
28:1114:93078:17:16:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:foreclosure are decreasing in the predicted probability of bankruptcy protection. The upward slope
28:1115:93176:16:17:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the earnings MTE and downward slope in the mortality and home foreclosure MTEs suggest that
28:1116:93270:17:16:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers on the margin of bankruptcy who are assigned to the most lenient judges experience the largest
28:1117:93371:16:17:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gains when granted bankruptcy protection. These are likely filers with unobservable characteristics
28:1118:93470:17:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that make them the least likely to be granted bankruptcy in the first place, as the margin for
28:1119:93564:16:17:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively lenient judges should entail relatively less deserving filers.  This interpretation of the
28:1120:93665:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates suggests that the impact of Chapter 13 on earnings is modestly larger for less deserving
28:1121:93763:16:16:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debtors. Conversely, the MTE function for employment is flat, suggesting that the employment
28:1122:93855:16:18:72:413:159:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:effects do not differ systematically across unobservable characteristics.17
28:1123:93930:18:15:83:539:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:16Following Doyle (2007), the pilot bandwidth was chosen by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the
28:1124:94038:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:local quadratic estimator and a fourth-degree polynomial model for each outcome. Larger bandwidths lead to more
28:1125:94149:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:linear relationships and flatter MTE estimates. We chose the minimum bandwidth across all outcomes to explore
28:1126:94258:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:variations from linearity. The local quadratic estimator was chosen as it is thought to have better properties when
28:1127:94373:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:evaluating first derivatives (Fan and Gijbels 1996). Results are nearly identical for higher and lower polynomials and
28:1128:94491:11:7:72:219:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:both larger and smaller bandwidths.
28:1129:94526:7:0:83:539:75:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17Appendix Figure 12 reports the MTE of Chapter 13 protection for 401k contributions, DI, and SSI, and Appendix
29:1130:94639:0:17:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A second potential caveat is we are only able to use instrumental variables design in bankruptcy
29:1131:94735:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:offices that randomly assign filings to judges. Recall from Table 1 that our estimation sample is
29:1132:94832:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broadly similar to the full sample of Chapter 13 filings. Yet, it is possible that the two groups of
29:1133:94932:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:filers differ in some unobservable way. We provide estimates of the impact of Chapter 13 protection
29:1134:95031:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in our full sample using an event study methodology that compares the outcomes of granted and
29:1135:95124:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dismissed filers. Our event strategy design is in the spirit of Bound’s (1989) analysis of accepted
29:1136:95223:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and rejected DI applicants, and more recent work estimating the effects of job loss on subsequent
29:1137:95320:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes (Jacobson, Lalonde, and Sullivan 1993, von Wachter, Song, and Manchester 2009, Sullivan
29:1138:95416:16:16:72:185:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and von Wachter 2009).
29:1139:95438:16:17:88:539:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, our event study design uses granted filers as a treatment group and dismissed filers
29:1140:95535:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as a control group. The key identifying assumption is that dismissed filers would have experienced
29:1141:95633:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same outcomes as granted filers had they been granted bankruptcy protection. However, recall
29:1142:95729:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from Figure 3 that dismissed filers start with lower earnings and experience larger earnings shocks
29:1143:95828:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before filing than granted filers. To account for the difference in pre-filing earnings between granted
29:1144:95931:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and dismissed filers, we include individual fixed effects that control for time-invariant differences
29:1145:96032:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across filers. To account for different earnings trends, we also include fixed effects for the decile of
29:1146:96136:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:predicted propensity score separate by event time. We estimate the propensity score using an OLS
29:1147:96232:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regression of an indicator for bankruptcy protection on gender, race, five-year age bins, five-years
29:1148:96332:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of baseline employment, five-years of baseline earnings, and office by month fixed effects. We then
29:1149:96431:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group filers into deciles of the predicted probability of receiving bankruptcy protection. Thus, our
29:1150:96531:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:event strategy design compares the outcomes of granted and dismissed filers with similar predicted
29:1151:96629:17:16:72:324:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probabilities of being granted bankruptcy protection.
29:1152:96682:16:36:88:407:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Formally, we estimate various specifications of the following model:

29:1166:97402:16:16:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that all parameter estimates measure differences relative to this base year. For mortality and home

29:1168:97605:33:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Figure 13 reports the MTE of the job mobility outcomes described in Table 7. Consistent with our main results, the
29:1169:97719:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:MTE functions for DI and SSI are decreasing in the predicted probability of bankruptcy protection and the MTE
29:1170:97828:11:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:functions for same state, same industry, same job, and average firm wage are increasing in the predicted probability
29:1171:97944:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of bankruptcy protection. These results suggest that filers on the margin of bankruptcy who are assigned to the most
29:1172:98060:11:11:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:lenient judges experience the largest gains in stability when granted bankruptcy protection. The MTE functions for
29:1173:98174:11:0:72:300:71:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:401k contributions, same county, and job tenure are flat.
30:1174:98233:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As a result, our event study estimates for these outcomes are likely attenuated towards zero as we
30:1175:98331:17:16:72:502:692:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attribute any treatment effects in the year of filing to the effects of bankruptcy protection.
30:1176:98425:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Appendix Figure 14 presents event study estimates of equation (12) for Chapter 13 filers in our
30:1177:98520:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimation sample and all Chapter 13 filers in our data. The “full” sample is restricted to a ten
30:1178:98617:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent random draw of first-time filers for the non-foreclosure results for computational reasons.
30:1179:98716:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The home foreclosure sample includes all first-time filers in counties covered by DataQuick. Standard
30:1180:98817:16:17:72:274:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:errors are clustered at the individual level.
30:1181:98862:17:16:88:539:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a large and statistically significant effect of Chapter 13 protection on all of our outcomes
30:1182:98963:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in both the estimation sample and the full sample of Chapter 13 filers. Over the first five post-filing
30:1183:99066:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:years, filers receiving Chapter 13 protection earn $4,034 to $5,581 more than dismissed filers in
30:1184:99163:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our estimation sample, and $3,783 to $5,114 more in our full sample. Employment is 2.6 to 8.1
30:1185:99256:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points higher in our estimation sample, and 2.3 to 6.7 percentage points higher in our
30:1186:99353:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:full sample. Five-year mortality and foreclosure are 2.0 and 10.9 percentage points lower in our
30:1187:99449:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimation sample, and 1.5 and 12.9 percentage points lower in our full sample. Thus, the impact
30:1188:99545:17:16:72:462:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Chapter 13 protection appears to be similar in our full and estimation samples.
30:1189:99627:16:16:88:539:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A final concern is that our analysis has focused on Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which makes up about
30:1190:99722:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:25 percent of all bankruptcy filings. Recall that there is not enough variation in the treatment of
30:1191:99821:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Chapter 7 cases to estimate the effects of Chapter 7 protection using our instrumental variables
30:1192:99917:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy.  Appendix Figure 14 presents results for Chapter 7 protection using our event study
30:1193:100010:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:methodology described above. We again restrict the non-foreclosure results to a ten percent random
30:1194:100108:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:draw of all first-time filers. The home foreclosure sample includes all first-time filers in counties
30:1195:100209:17:16:72:180:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covered by DataQuick.
30:1196:100230:16:16:88:539:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The effect of Chapter 7 protection is much more modest than the effect of Chapter 13 protection.
30:1197:100326:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Over the first five post-filing years, filers granted Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection earn $1,639 to
30:1198:100426:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:$1,936 more than dismissed filers, and are 2.4 to 2.8 percentage points more likely to be employed.
30:1199:100525:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Filers granted Chapter 7 protection are 1.7 percentage points less likely to experience a home
30:1200:100619:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:foreclosure after five years, but are no more or less likely to be deceased. The more modest impact
30:1201:100718:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Chapter 7 is somewhat surprising given the fact that, in principle, all Chapter 7 filers have the
30:1202:100818:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:option of filing under Chapter 13. The more modest benefits of Chapter 7 therefore seem likely to
30:1203:100915:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be the result of the different composition of filers under each Chapter. There may also be important
30:1204:101015:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacts of Chapter 7 on other ex-post outcomes that we are not measuring here, such as credit
30:1205:101108:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:availability or cost, that compare more favorably with respect to Chapter 13. Finally, it is possible
30:1206:101209:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that our event study design is less plausible for Chapter 7 cases. Less than two percent of Chapter
30:1207:101308:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:7 cases are dismissed, with these cases typically dismissed due to fraud or an inability to complete
30:1208:101408:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the bankruptcy paperwork correctly. Thus, dismissed Chapter 7 filers may not be a suitable control
30:1209:101506:17:0:72:184:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:group for granted filers.
31:1210:101533:0:28:261:351:708:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:VI. Conclusion
31:1211:101547:28:16:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we estimate the impact of Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on subsequent labor

31:1213:101739:16:17:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:annual earnings in the first five post-filing years by $5,562, a 25.1 percent increase from the baseline
31:1214:101843:17:16:72:540:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mean. Employment increases by 6.8 percentage points over the same time period, an 8.3 percent
31:1215:101936:16:17:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase from the baseline mean. Five-year mortality is 1.2 percentage points lower, a 30.0 percent
31:1216:102035:17:16:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decrease from the dismissed filer mortality rate, with five-year foreclosure rates falling by 19.1
31:1217:102133:16:17:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percentage points, a more than one hundred percent decrease from the dismissed filer foreclosure
31:1218:102229:17:16:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rate. We find evidence consistent with the results being driven by increased incentive to work and
31:1219:102327:16:16:72:540:549:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increased economic stability following the receipt of bankruptcy protection. A descriptive analysis of
31:1220:102429:16:17:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:granted and dismissed filers further suggests the impacts are driven by the deterioration of outcomes
31:1221:102530:17:16:72:378:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:among dismissed filers as opposed to any gains by granted filers.
31:1222:102595:16:17:88:539:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results provide new evidence on the ex-post benefits of debt relief. These results are par-
31:1223:102690:17:16:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ticularly important in light of the on-going debate surrounding the use of debt relief and mortgage

31:1225:102884:17:16:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Krugman (2012) suggests that household borrowing constraints can help explain the severity of the
31:1226:102981:16:17:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:recession, while Mian and Sufi (2012) show that regional differences in debt overhang can explain
31:1227:103078:17:16:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:differences in unemployment. Our estimates also suggest that the restrictions on bankruptcy fil-
31:1228:103174:16:16:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing introduced by the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act may have
31:1229:103265:16:17:72:280:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important adverse consequences on debtors.
31:1230:103307:17:16:88:539:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The main limitation of our analysis is that we are not able to estimate the impact of bankruptcy
31:1231:103403:16:17:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:laws on ex-ante borrowing costs or behavior.  There may also be important ex-post impacts of
31:1232:103495:17:16:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:bankruptcy protection on outcomes such as credit availability that we are unable to measure with
31:1233:103591:16:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our data. Finally, our analysis has focused on Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which makes up about 25
31:1234:103684:17:16:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:percent of all bankruptcy filings. This paper should therefore be viewed as a first step towards
31:1235:103780:16:0:72:420:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characterizing the impact of consumer bankruptcy protection on debtors.

36:1389:114870:11:11:77:545:424:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:leniency is the leave-one-out mean rate of granting Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection for the assigned judge minus

36:1392:115221:11:11:77:545:391:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:residuals. We then take the mean residual in each judge by year bin, adding the mean discharge rate to each residual
36:1393:115337:11:11:77:545:380:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:to aid in the interpretation of the plot. The solid line shows the best linear fit estimated on the underlying micro data

54:1773:141923:11:11:77:545:264:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:leniency is the leave-one-out mean rate of granting Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection for the assigned judge minus

57:1837:145898:11:11:77:545:248:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:predict the probability of bankruptcy protection using our leave-one-out measure of judge leniency. We then predict

57:1839:146129:11:11:77:545:226:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:quadratic estimator with bandwidth 0.069. The estimates of the first derivative of this relationship are then evaluated
57:1840:146248:11:11:77:545:215:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:at each percentile of the predicted probability. Standard errors are calculated using a bootstrap procedure with 250
57:1841:146364:11:11:77:545:204:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:iterations. All monetary values are expressed in real 2000 dollars divided by 1,000. Earnings information comes
57:1842:146475:11:11:77:545:193:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:from the W-2, and is averaged over the first five post-filing years. Employment is an indicator for non-zero wage
57:1843:146588:11:11:77:545:182:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:earnings on the W-2, and is averaged over the first five post-filing years. Five-year mortality is an indicator for being

57:1845:146828:11:10:77:545:160:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:an indicator for a filer’s home receiving a notice of default, receiving a notice of transfer or sale, or being transferred

62:1909:151133:0:11:77:545:710:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Notes: These figures plot event study results of the impact of Chapter 13 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.
62:1910:151243:11:11:77:545:699:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:The Judge IV sample includes all first-time filings between 1992 and 2005 in the 42 offices that randomly assign
62:1911:151355:11:11:77:545:688:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:cases to judges.  The full sample includes a 10 percent random sample of all first-time filings between 1992 and
62:1912:151467:11:11:77:545:677:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:2005 in the 72 bankruptcy courts that allow electronic access to their dockets. The foreclosure sample includes all
62:1913:151582:11:11:77:545:666:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:filings originating in county by year bins with foreclosure data coverage. We report the coefficient on an indicator for
62:1914:151702:11:11:77:545:655:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:receiving bankruptcy protection interacted with the specified year. We control for individual, year, and propensity

62:1917:152056:11:11:77:545:622:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:entered individually, office fixed effects, and filing year fixed effects. We then split the sample into deciles and interact
62:1918:152181:11:11:77:545:611:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:each decile with year indicators for the five years before and after filing, omitting the year prior to filing. Standard
62:1919:152301:11:11:77:545:600:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:errors are clustered at the individual level. Year 0 indicates the year a debtor files for bankruptcy protection. All
62:1920:152418:11:10:77:545:589:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:monetary values are expressed in real 2000 dollars. Earnings information comes from the W-2. Employment is an
62:1921:152527:10:11:77:545:579:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:indicator for non-zero wage earnings on the W-2. Mortality is an indicator for being deceased in the indicated year
62:1922:152642:11:11:77:545:568:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:using information from the Death Master File. Foreclosure is an indicator for a filer’s home receiving a notice of
62:1923:152756:11:11:77:545:557:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:default, receiving a notice of transfer or sale, or being transferred to a REO or a guarantor. See text for additional
