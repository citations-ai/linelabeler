2:20:782:56:33:273:338:581:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ABSTRACT
2:21:790:33:22:108:538:548:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Nearly 60 percent of college students today are women.  Using longitudinal data on a nationally
2:22:885:22:21:72:538:526:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:representative cohort of eighth grade students in 1988, I examine two potential explanations for the
2:23:985:21:21:72:538:505:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:differential attendance rates of men and women -- returns to schooling and non-cognitive skills. The
2:24:1085:21:21:72:538:484:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attendance  gap  is  roughly  five  percentage  points  for  all  high  school  graduates.    Conditional  on
2:25:1194:21:22:72:538:463:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:attendance, however, there are few differences in type of college, enrollment status or selectivity of
2:26:1296:22:21:72:538:441:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:institution.  The majority of the attendance gap can be explained by differences in the characteristics of
2:27:1402:21:21:72:538:420:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:men and women, despite some gender differences in the determinants of college attendance.  I find that
2:28:1504:21:21:72:538:399:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher non-cognitive skills and college premiums among women account for nearly 90 percent of the
2:29:1601:21:21:72:538:378:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gender  gap  in  higher  education.    Interestingly,  non-cognitive  factors  continue  to  influence  college
2:30:1712:21:100:72:333:357:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enrollment after controlling for high school achievement.

3:40:1934:27:27:108:519:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Today nearly 60 percent of college students are women (Bae, Choy, Geddes, Sable & 
3:41:2016:27:28:72:523:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Synder 2000).  Among low-income and minority students, young women are 25 percent more 
3:42:2103:28:28:72:540:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:likely than young men to enroll in some form of postsecondary education.1  While the enrollment 
3:43:2199:28:27:72:523:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:gap differential was first evident in the late seventies, it has recently begun to attract attention 
3:44:2300:27:28:72:501:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:from a broad spectrum of individuals including high school guidance counselors, college 
3:45:2388:28:27:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:admissions officers, and policymakers (Koerner 1999; Mortenson 1999; Sommers 2000).  Given 
3:46:2479:27:28:72:515:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that changes in the U.S. economy over the past two decades have significantly increased the 
3:47:2571:28:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:return to college and cognitive ability (Katz & Murphy 1992; Levy & Murnane 1992; Murnane, 
3:48:2662:28:27:72:513:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Willet & Levy 1995), the relative decline in college enrollment among young men warrants 
3:49:2751:27:28:72:144:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:investigation.2 
3:50:2766:28:27:108:536:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:While there has been an increasing recognition of this gap, there are no empirical studies 
3:51:2857:27:28:72:523:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that specifically seek to explain the phenomena.  Some commentators have suggested that the 
3:52:2949:28:28:72:525:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:predominance of young men in the military and prison explain the gap.  However, in 1989 the 
3:53:3041:28:27:72:521:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attendance gap among 19-21 year olds was roughly eight percentage points.  If all boys in the 
3:54:3135:27:28:72:504:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:military or prison had attended college instead, the difference would still be roughly three 
3:55:3228:28:27:72:299:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percentage points (Cenus 1990; Justice 1997).  
3:56:3275:27:28:108:537:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In this paper, I examine two potential explanations for the differential attendance rates of 
3:57:3368:28:28:72:538:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:men and women—returns to schooling and non-cognitive skills.  Several studies have found that 
3:58:3462:28:27:72:510:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the returns to college are higher for women, particularly among young workers (Murphy & 
3:59:3550:27:26:72:519:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Welch 1989; Murphy & Welch 1992).  Kane (1994) reports that, among African-Americans, 
3:60:3636:26:7:72:219:131:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:                                                           
3:61:3694:7:11:72:412:124:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f4:1 Based on calculations using the NELS data that are described in more detail below. 
3:62:3779:11:16:72:524:113:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f4:2 While gender differences in college enrollment are commonly lamented in the media, it is not clear a priori that 
3:63:3894:16:0:72:530:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:this is a problem. If this finding simply represents different employment preferences or tastes for schooling, it may 
4:64:4014:0:28:72:541:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college earnings differentials rose faster for women than men in the eighties.  While women have 
4:65:4111:28:27:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:made considerable inroads into traditional white-collar male jobs, they have had significantly 
4:66:4206:27:28:72:516:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:less success moving into skilled blue-collar occupations (England & Farkas 1986; Reskin & 
4:67:4296:28:28:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Roose 1990).  For this reason, it is likely that a young man with high school diploma will have a 
4:68:4394:28:27:72:528:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:better chance than a comparable young woman of finding a relatively high paying construction 
4:69:4487:27:28:72:182:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:or manufacturing job.  
4:70:4510:28:27:108:502:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:While boys and girls today score roughly the same on most measures of cognitive 
4:71:4590:27:28:72:540:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ability,3 boys generally receive lower grades, have more disciplinary problems, are more likely to 
4:72:4689:28:28:72:495:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:be retained in grade and placed in special education, report lower school enjoyment and 
4:73:4777:28:27:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attachment and believe their teachers are less likely to encourage them (Kleinfeld 1998).  These 
4:74:4874:27:28:72:539:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:difficulties are often attributed to poor “non-cognitive” skills among boys, including the inability 
4:75:4975:28:27:72:526:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to pay attention in class, to work with others, to organize and keep track of homework or class 
4:76:5071:27:28:72:507:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:materials and to seek help from others.  In recent years, non-cognitive skills have received 
4:77:5164:28:28:72:517:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:increased attention among economists in trying to explain labor market success (Murnane & 
4:78:5254:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Levy 1996; Duncan & Dunifon 1998).  Low non-cognitive skills may reduce college attendance 
4:79:5345:27:28:72:522:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:rates indirectly by decreasing the likelihood that a student graduates high school or leading to 
4:80:5442:28:27:72:507:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:poor high school performance, which decreases the chance of being accepted to college or 
4:81:5531:27:28:72:533:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:receiving financial aid.  In addition, low non-cognitive skills may increase the non-pecuniary or 
4:82:5629:28:28:72:435:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:“psychic” costs of college, thereby decreasing the likelihood of enrollment. 
4:83:5706:28:27:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: Using longitudinal data on a nationally representative cohort of eighth grade students in 
4:84:5796:27:37:72:532:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1988, I find that the attendance gap is roughly five and ten percentage points for all high school 
4:85:5895:37:11:72:542:120:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:                                                                                                                                                                                           
4:86:6081:11:12:72:503:109:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:not be a matter for great societal concern.  Moreover, women are still disproportionately represented in non-
4:87:6190:12:7:72:367:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:technical fields and continue to lag behind men in earnings (Blau 1998).   
4:88:6265:7:16:72:530:90:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f4:2 In the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), boys scored higher in math and science while 
4:89:6376:16:0:72:316:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:girls scored higher in reading and writing (Sommers 2000).   
5:90:6439:0:28:72:535:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduates and lower-income graduates respectively.   Conditional on attendance, however, there 
5:91:6534:28:27:72:498:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are few differences in type of college, enrollment status or selectivity of institution.  The 
5:92:6628:27:28:72:533:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:majority of the attendance gap can be explained by differences in the characteristics of men and 
5:93:6725:28:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:women, despite some gender differences in the determinants of college attendance.  I find that 
5:94:6820:28:27:72:529:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:higher non-cognitive skills and college premiums among women account for nearly 80 percent 
5:95:6911:27:28:72:535:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of the gender gap in higher education.  Interestingly, non-cognitive factors continue to influence 
5:96:7010:28:27:72:390:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college enrollment after controlling for high school achievement.  
5:97:7077:27:28:108:541:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.   Section 2 lays out a simple model of 
5:98:7168:28:28:72:537:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college attendance.  Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and empirical strategy used in this paper.  
5:99:7268:28:27:72:517:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Section 5 presents some descriptive statistics on the differences between men and women in 
5:100:7359:27:28:72:502:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:terms of postsecondary experience including the type and selectivity of college attended.

5:104:7555:28:27:72:528:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: The following model highlights several possible factors underlying the gender gap.  To 
5:105:7642:27:28:72:524:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:begin, assume that an individual has graduated high school and has only one period, k, during 
5:106:7736:28:27:72:494:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:which to attend college.  Further assume that students who decide to attend college will 
5:107:7825:27:28:72:540:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduate.4  The primary motivation of the model is the view that an individual will attend college 
5:108:7924:28:28:72:536:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:if the benefits exceed the costs.  Here we consider only the financial benefit of college measured 
5:109:8023:28:27:72:539:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in terms of lifetime earnings.  Denote the earnings of a high school graduate in each period, t, as: 
5:110:8124:27:28:72:258:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Yht,     t= k, k+1, . . . T

8:241:11379:0:28:72:507:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:g in state s.  The differential is computed as the log difference between the median weekly 
8:242:11471:28:27:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:earnings of college graduates (B.A. or higher) and high school graduates.  These measures are 
8:243:11565:27:28:72:519:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:constructed using census data drawn from the 1990 PUMS.  This state level measure may be 
8:244:11654:28:28:72:375:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:thought of as an average premium for individuals in the state.   
8:245:11719:28:27:108:529:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:I utilize four measures of non-cognitive ability.   Two measures—middle school grades 
8:246:11805:27:28:72:503:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and the number of hours spent on homework per week in eighth grade—reflect effort and 
8:247:11891:28:27:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:achievement in school.  Grades are measured on a scale of zero to four, where a four indicates an 
8:248:11989:27:28:72:536:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:“A” average, a three indicates a “B” average, etc.  The idea here is that, conditional on cognitive 
8:249:12089:28:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ability, school achievement is determined by a variety of non-cognitive skills such as the ability 
8:250:12188:28:27:72:514:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to follow directions, work in groups, pay attention in class, and organize materials.  Student 
8:251:12283:27:28:72:503:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:behavior serves as another measure of non-cognitive skill because it reflects the ability to 
8:252:12376:28:27:72:515:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:successfully negotiate the school environment.  I create a composite measure of disciplinary 
8:253:12469:27:28:72:522:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:incidents from a set of NELS questions that ask students to indicate how often during the last 
8:254:12564:28:28:72:539:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:semester they were sent to the office for misbehaving, received a warning about their attendance, 
8:255:12662:28:27:72:523:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:grades or behavior and got into a physical fight with another student.5  Finally, an indicator of 
8:256:12760:27:28:72:522:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether the child had ever been retained in grade during elementary school serves as a fourth 
8:257:12854:28:27:72:504:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:measure of non-cognitive skills insofar as retention decisions are largely based on teacher 
8:258:12946:27:28:72:349:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:perceptions of a student’s social maturity and behavior.    
8:259:13006:28:28:108:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Among the 12,585 students in the NELS 1988-94 panel sample (i.e., students with survey 
8:260:13093:28:27:72:526:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:data for all four waves), 67.3 percent of women had some postsecondary education by 1994 in 
8:261:13185:27:28:72:538:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:comparison to only 62.3 percent of men.  These attendance rates are somewhat higher than those 
8:262:13280:28:32:72:534:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:documented in other national samples.  For example, in the 1990 Census, nearly 51.4 percent of 
8:263:13375:32:7:72:219:97:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:                                                           
8:264:13433:7:16:72:529:90:42:g_d0_f38:99:g_d0_f36:5 Principal components analysis was used to create a single composite from the NELS items BYS55A-F described 
8:265:13542:16:0:72:108:74:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:above.    
9:266:13554:0:28:72:521:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:19-21 year old women had attained some postsecondary experience compared with only 43.4 
9:267:13642:28:27:72:538:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percent of males.  The comparable figures for the 1993 October Current Popular Survey are 54.3 
9:268:13737:27:28:72:533:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percent and 48.7 percent.  One possible explanation for this difference involves sample attrition 
9:269:13835:28:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in NELS—i.e., those least likely to attend college have dropped out of the study and would not 
9:270:13930:28:27:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:be included in the 1988-94 panel.  In addition, it is possible that the detailed nature of the NELS 
9:271:14030:27:28:72:508:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:survey questionnaire identified schooling experiences that individuals would not have self-
9:272:14121:28:27:72:515:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reported in the simpler Census or CPS surveys.   However, the magnitude of the gap closely 
9:273:14212:27:28:72:502:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:resembles the numbers one obtains from other sources and a more detailed breakdown of 
9:274:14298:28:28:72:535:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:differential attendance patterns by demographic group is consistent with data on the distribution 
9:275:14396:28:27:72:337:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of undergraduates nationally (Horn & Berktold 1998).  
9:276:14450:27:28:108:531:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:I delete 1,660 cases (13 percent of the total) because of missing data in one or more key 
9:277:14540:28:27:72:499:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:variables such as student demographics, college attendance, high school graduation, non-
9:278:14628:27:28:72:525:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:cognitive skills and college premiums.6  This leaves a total of 10,925 students, of which 9,734 
9:279:14724:28:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduated high school and 6,877 were high school graduates in the bottom three quartiles of the 
9:280:14820:28:27:72:540:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:SES distribution (based on the entire NELS sample).  While this reduced sample appears slightly 
9:281:14916:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more advantaged than the full panel sample, the differences do not seem unreasonably large.  For 
9:282:15013:28:27:72:505:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:example, 82 percent of the full panel graduated high school and 65 percent attended some 
9:283:15102:27:28:72:525:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college by 1994 in contrast to 86 percent and 68 percent in the reduced sample.  Similarly, the 
9:284:15198:28:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:students in the full sample came from families at the 51th percentile of the SES distribution while 
9:285:15298:28:27:72:522:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the average in the reduced sample was at the 53nd percentile.  In order to estimate models that 
9:286:15394:27:28:72:540:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:include measures of high school achievement, labor force participation in high school and family 
9:287:15491:28:0:72:532:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:formation after high school, I imputed values for cases with missing data on these variables.  In 
10:288:15592:0:28:72:519:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the estimation, I include dummy variables to indicate whether the value of each variable was 
10:289:15685:28:27:72:127:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:imputed.7   
10:290:15697:27:28:108:526:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Summary statistics for men and women in the sample are shown in Table 1.  There are 
10:291:15781:28:28:72:523:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:few differences between boys and girls in terms of cognitive ability or family background.  In 
10:292:15876:28:27:72:504:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:contrast, boys and girls have considerably different non-cognitive skills.  For example, 18 
10:293:15968:27:28:72:518:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percent of boys were retained in elementary school compared with 12 percent of girls.  Forty 
10:294:16061:28:27:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percent of boys have demonstrated some type of behavior problem compared with only 20 
10:295:16147:27:28:72:528:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percent of girls.  Boys are disproportionately represented in remedial classes, get lower grades, 
10:296:16245:28:28:72:511:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and spend less time on homework than girls.  These differences carry over into high school 
10:297:16336:28:27:72:522:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:where girls have higher grades and are more likely to be in an academic track.  There are also 
10:298:16431:27:28:72:525:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:differences in the college premiums earned by young men and women.  Young female college 
10:299:16520:28:27:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduates earn roughly 55 percent more than female high school graduates in contrast to male 
10:300:16613:27:28:72:422:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduates who earn only 40 percent more than their less educated peers.  
10:301:16686:28:195:72:81:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:   
10:302:16689:195:7:72:542:155:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:                                                                                                                                                                                           
10:303:16875:7:16:72:525:148:42:g_d0_f38:99:g_d0_f36:6 Cases with missing data in the following variables were discarded: race, gender, college attendance, urban/rural 
10:304:16990:16:12:72:531:132:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:location, high school graduation, middle school grades, homework, retention and behavior problems, state, tuition, 
10:305:17105:12:7:72:373:120:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:unemployment, college density, college premiums and employment shares. 
10:306:17176:7:16:72:540:113:42:g_d0_f38:99:g_d0_f36:7 Values are imputed using predictions from a linear regression that includes student demographics, standardized test 
10:307:17294:16:11:72:511:97:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:scores, parental education and income, state and other measures of academic achievement.  While subsequent 
10:308:17401:11:12:72:530:86:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:estimates using imputed values may still be biased, it is often preferable to simply deleting cases with missing data 
10:309:17519:12:0:72:172:74:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:(Little & Rubin 1987).    
11:310:17548:0:27:72:185:708:144:g_d0_f35:144:g_d0_f35:4.  Empirical strategy 
11:311:17571:27:27:108:539:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The gender gap could be due to differences in either the characteristics of young men and 
11:312:17661:27:28:72:515:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:women or the way in which men and women respond to these characteristics.  For example, 
11:313:17749:28:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:women may be more likely to attend college because they have greater cognitive ability than 
11:314:17841:28:27:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:men, or because cognitive ability is a stronger determinant of college attendance for women than 
11:315:17938:27:28:72:122:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for men.   
11:316:17949:28:27:108:520:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:I first examine whether there are significant gender differences in the determinants of 
11:317:18037:27:28:72:495:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college attendance for men and women by estimating the following the following linear

11:320:18215:31:28:72:525:428:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:where the i and g subscripts reflect individuals and gender groups, C is an indicator of college 
11:321:18312:28:29:72:537:400:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attendance, X is a vector of college determinants including cognitive ability, family background, 
11:322:18410:29:28:72:514:371:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:non-cognitive skills, college costs and returns to schooling, and ε is a stochastic error term.  
11:323:18507:28:28:108:487:343:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:While this comparison can determine whether there are statistically significant 
11:324:18587:28:27:72:532:315:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:differences between the magnitude of various determinants for men and women, it does not tell 
11:325:18681:27:28:72:532:288:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:how large a role such coefficient differences play in explaining the gap.  To do so, I decompose 
11:326:18778:28:27:72:478:260:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the gender gap into the proportion that can be attributed to differences in observable 
11:327:18865:27:28:72:536:233:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:characteristics between boys and girls and the remaining proportion.  Such decompositions have 
11:328:18960:28:28:72:536:205:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:a long history in studies of wage discrimination, beginning with the work of Oaxaca (1973) who 
11:329:19055:28:27:72:537:177:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decomposed the wage differential between men and women into a component due to differences 
11:330:19146:27:28:72:524:150:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in observable characteristics and a component due to unexplained differences in the returns to 
11:331:19241:28:36:72:539:122:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:these characteristics, which he interpreted in terms of discrimination  (Blinder 1973; Jones 1983; 
11:332:19340:36:7:72:219:86:99:g_d0_f36:99:g_d0_f36:

12:335:19584:28:27:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In the case of college attendance, we can begin by writing the difference between males and 
12:336:19676:27:34:72:335:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:females in the average probability of attending college

12:338:19760:35:32:72:526:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:where the mfββˆ and ˆ are taken from (3).  This attendance difference can be separated into two 
12:339:19854:32:27:72:540:553:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:components—one due to differences in observed characteristics and one due to differences in the 
12:340:19950:27:28:72:531:526:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimated coefficients of the two groups.  To do this decomposition, however, one must choose

12:359:20930:16:12:72:509:86:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:conversion,” emphasizing the role of societal forces such as discrimination in determining college attendance 
12:360:21040:12:0:72:476:74:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:differences.  Alternative explanations might focus on differences in preferences or opportunity costs. 
13:361:21146:0:28:72:526:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In this model, the coefficient on Female reflects the magnitude of the gender gap.  By entering 
13:362:21242:28:27:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:covariates one-by-one, we can examine which observable characteristics (if any) mediate the 
13:363:21334:27:28:72:328:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:relationship between gender and college attendance.

13:366:21444:27:28:108:531:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To begin, one might ask to what extent the college gender gap can be explained by high 
13:367:21531:28:27:72:509:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:school graduation rates.  For example, it may be the case that boys are simply less likely to 
13:368:21625:27:28:72:529:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduate high school but, conditional on graduation, boys are equally (or more) likely to attend 
13:369:21722:28:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college.  Table 2 shows that this is not the case.10  While boys are slightly less likely to graduate 
13:370:21824:28:27:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:high school than girls, the college attendance gap is roughly five percentage points among all 
13:371:21919:27:28:72:519:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:high school graduates.  Conversely, boys are more likely to be employed and in the military.  
13:372:22013:28:27:72:532:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Roughly the same number of boys and girls are neither in college, working nor in the military.   
13:373:22110:27:28:108:538:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Conditional on attending college, women are equally likely to attend a four-year college.  
13:374:22201:28:28:72:533:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Women are roughly 33 percent more likely to attend a vocational or trade school, largely due to 
13:375:22297:28:27:72:492:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the predominance of women in programs for clerical workers.  There are no significant 
13:376:22383:27:28:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:differences between men and women in terms of full-time versus part-time enrollment status.  
13:377:22476:28:27:72:507:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Finally, conditional on attending a four-year college, men appear to enroll in slightly more 
13:378:22569:27:28:72:542:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:selective institutions.  Most notably, men attend colleges in which students score about ten points 
13:379:22669:28:28:72:498:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:higher on the math portion of the SAT.  Assuming the ability distribution of high school 
13:380:22758:28:27:72:519:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:graduates is roughly equivalent for men and women, this slight advantage for women merely 
13:381:22848:27:28:72:536:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reflects the fact that males who attend college come from a somewhat higher point on the ability 
13:382:22945:28:0:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distribution on average.  It is likely that the more noticeable advantage in math SAT scores also 
14:383:23046:0:28:72:534:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reflects the preference for men to enroll in schools that are more heavily oriented towards math, 
14:384:23144:28:27:72:235:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:science and engineering.

14:387:23245:28:27:108:479:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:As mentioned above, the gender gap could be due to differences in either the 
14:388:23322:27:28:72:532:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:characteristics of young men and women or the way in which men and women respond to these 
14:389:23412:28:27:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:characteristics.  This section explores the latter.  The reasons that boys and girls in the NELS cite 
14:390:23514:27:28:72:533:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for not attending college suggest that they approach the college attendance decision differently.  
14:391:23613:28:28:72:522:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:For example, 37 percent of boys cite a “dislike of school” compared with 26 percent of girls.  
14:392:23708:28:27:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Similarly, 49 percent of boys say that they would rather work and earn money than go to college 
14:393:23804:27:28:72:516:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:compared with 41 percent of girls and 23 percent of boys claim that they will not need more 
14:394:23896:28:27:72:360:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:school for their jobs compared with 16 percent of girls.        
14:395:23960:27:28:108:533:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In order to provide a more formal examination of the college enrollment decision, Table 
14:396:24048:28:28:72:498:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:3 presents the results from the linear probability model shown in equation (1), estimated 
14:397:24138:28:27:72:520:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:separately for men and women.  Note that the asterisks indicate whether the male and female 
14:398:24230:27:28:72:536:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:coefficients are statistically different from each other.  In general, the traditional determinants of 
14:399:24333:28:27:72:496:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college attendance appear significant and in the expected direction.  Among women, for 
14:400:24420:27:28:72:534:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:example, a 25 percentage point increase in the SES distribution (roughly one standard deviation 
14:401:24516:28:28:72:523:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in this sample) results in a 7.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of attending college 
14:402:24614:28:27:72:525:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:while a one standard deviation increase in math achievement coincides with more than a three 
14:403:24707:27:28:72:540:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percentage point increase in the probability of college attendance.  Non-cognitive skills appear to 
14:404:24807:28:26:72:520:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:have effects on college enrollment that are of the same magnitude as traditional determinants

14:406:25089:11:12:78:519:92:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50: As described above, the NELS sample I use here is likely not representative of more marginal students due to 
14:407:25199:12:0:72:537:80:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:sample attrition and missing data.  It is possible that high school graduation may account for more of the gender gap 
15:408:25320:0:28:72:539:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:such as family background and cognitive ability.  For example, a one standard deviation increase 
15:409:25417:28:27:72:526:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:in middle school grades is associated with a 7.7 percentage point increase in the probability of 
15:410:25514:27:28:72:539:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:enrollment for boys.  Male high school graduates who repeated a grade during elementary school 
15:411:25609:28:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are roughly seven percentage points less likely than their peers to attend college.  The measures 
15:412:25707:28:27:72:486:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of direct and opportunity costs and returns to schooling have less pronounced effects.  
15:413:25795:27:28:108:518:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:There are also some interesting differences between men and women.  It appears that 
15:414:25879:28:27:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:family background is a stronger determinant of attendance for men whereas cognitive ability 
15:415:25971:27:28:72:527:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(particularly reading ability) is a stronger determinant for women.  While growing up in single 
15:416:26067:28:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:parent household decreases the probability of college attendance by roughly three percentage 
15:417:26160:28:27:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:points for boys, it does not have a significant impact on enrollment for girls.  This is consistent 
15:418:26260:27:28:72:524:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with the literature that emphasizes the importance of male role models for boys’ development 
15:419:26353:28:27:72:283:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(Hetherington, Bridges & Insabella 1998).   
15:420:26397:27:28:108:485:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Finally, Table 3 provides some tentative evidence regarding the importance of 
15:421:26475:28:28:72:512:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:opportunity costs in college enrollment.  Insofar as manufacturing and construction are still 
15:422:26569:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:largely male dominated industries, one would expect that the importance of these industries in a 
15:423:26666:27:28:72:513:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:local economy would provide greater economic opportunities for low-skilled men than low-
15:424:26754:28:27:72:499:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:skilled women.  If we believe that opportunity costs play an important role in the college 
15:425:26845:27:28:72:492:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attendance decision, we might expect the gender gap to be larger in states with a strong 
15:426:26934:28:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:construction or manufacturing base.  Similarly, the gender gap may be larger in rural areas where 
15:427:27032:28:27:72:500:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:agricultural or other “male” jobs are more common.  Consistent with this view, the point 
15:428:27121:27:28:72:535:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:estimates for living in a rural area or in a state with a larger construction base are larger for boys 
15:429:27224:28:43:72:129:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:than girls.   
15:430:27238:43:12:72:542:86:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:                                                                                                                                                                                           
15:431:27424:12:0:72:542:74:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:among this group.  However, since this study focuses on high school graduates, this is not a significant concern here.  
16:432:27547:0:28:108:499:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:While one can reject the equivalence of the separate male and female regressions

16:434:27722:27:28:72:519:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that differences in observable characteristics, rather than differences in how men and women 
16:435:27815:28:28:72:505:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:respond to these characteristics, explain the majority of the observed difference in college 
16:436:27908:28:27:72:517:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attendance rates.  Of the total 4.9 percentage point gap, only 0.2 percentage points cannot be 
16:437:28003:27:28:72:340:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explained by differences in observable characteristics.

16:441:28231:28:27:72:486:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:characteristics, we now examine which of these characteristics explain the enrollment

16:443:28406:28:27:72:534:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:unconditional gap, which is roughly five percentage points among all high school graduates and

16:445:28592:28:28:72:540:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explanatory variables.  As expected, family background and cognitive ability do not substantially 
16:446:28690:28:27:72:524:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:affect the gap.  However, when we add measures of non-cognitive skills in Column 4, the gap 
16:447:28782:27:28:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:drops almost three percentage points—roughly 40 percent—among all high school graduates.  
16:448:28872:28:27:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:When we control for the college premium and other economic factors, the gap drops another two 
16:449:28966:27:28:72:530:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percentage points and is no longer statistically significant.11  This suggests that among students 
16:450:29065:28:28:72:498:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with similar family background, cognitive ability and non-cognitive skills, in states with 
16:451:29156:28:27:72:527:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:comparable college premiums for men and women, there is no appreciable difference between 
16:452:29246:27:48:72:418:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the college attendance rates of male and female high school graduates.   
16:453:29319:48:7:72:219:109:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:                                                           
16:454:29377:7:16:72:514:102:42:g_d0_f51:99:g_d0_f50:11 Note that the college premium is driving the effect on the female coefficient because it is the only one of the 
16:455:29492:16:12:72:494:86:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:economic variables that is correlated with gender and, in this model, the effect of explanatory variables is 
16:456:29601:12:0:72:264:74:99:g_d0_f50:99:g_d0_f50:constrained to be identical for men and women. 
17:457:29651:0:28:108:521:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The final two columns of Table 4 include controls for high school achievement, work 
17:458:29735:28:27:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:experience, marriage and fertility.  While these factors are clearly endogenous to the schooling 
17:459:29832:27:28:72:535:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decision, the results provide a useful description of the college attendance process.  High school 
17:460:29931:28:28:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:achievement is positively related to college attendance and working 20 hours a week or more 
17:461:30023:28:27:72:521:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:during high school is negatively related to enrollment.  Since girls have generally higher high 
17:462:30119:27:28:72:508:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:school achievement and are less likely to work during this time, when we control for these 
17:463:30210:28:27:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:factors, the gender gap shrinks even more.  Marriage and fertility (before age 21) are negatively 
17:464:30308:27:28:72:531:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:associated with enrollment and higher among women, so when we control for these factors, the 
17:465:30401:28:28:72:180:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:gender gap increases.  
17:466:30424:28:27:108:529:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Note that when we control for high school achievement and work experience as well as 
17:467:30509:27:28:72:541:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:family formation, the influence of non-cognitive skill diminishes but remains significant.  In fact,

17:470:30792:28:28:72:384:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:continues to exert a substantial influence on college enrollment.

17:472:30861:27:28:72:167:295:144:g_d0_f53:144:g_d0_f53:8.    Conclusions    
17:473:30882:28:27:108:513:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:While the gender gap in higher education has received increasing attention in recent 
17:474:30967:27:28:72:521:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:years, it has gone largely unexplained in the empirical research literature.  The most common 
17:475:31061:28:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:explanations of “where the boys are,” military and prisons, cannot explain the college enrollment 
17:476:31159:28:27:72:536:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:differentials between men and women.  This study suggests higher returns to college and greater 
17:477:31255:27:28:72:443:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:non-cognitive skills among women account for nearly 90 percent of the gap.  
17:478:31331:28:27:108:508:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Given the influence of non-cognitive ability on educational attainment, it would be 
17:479:31415:27:0:72:530:102:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:interesting to know whether certain school characteristics foster the development of such skills 
18:480:31515:0:28:72:537:709:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and if certain types of curriculum, pedagogy or learning environments are more effective for one 
18:481:31612:28:27:72:541:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:gender than the other.12  This would not only deepen our understanding of the differential college 
18:482:31711:27:28:72:538:654:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:enrollment, but also may provide ways in which schooling could be restructured to foster greater 
18:483:31808:28:28:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:success for boys.  In addition, these findings raise questions about the differential trends in 
18:484:31904:28:27:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:college attendance over the past three or four decades.  Male and female enrollment among new 
18:485:31998:27:28:72:515:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:high school graduates reached parity in the mid-to-late seventies, and female attendance has 
18:486:32091:28:27:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:since outpaced that of men.  While a variety of potential explanations come quickly to mind, 
18:487:32184:27:28:72:494:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:including changes in marriage and fertility rates, labor force participation and returns to 
18:488:32276:28:28:72:480:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:schooling, the simultaneity of these changes make it is extremely difficult to identify 
18:489:32364:28:27:72:408:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:independent causal factors underlying the rise in female attendance.    
18:490:32436:27:28:108:541:433:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Finally, the findings presented suggest that non-cognitive factors may play a larger role in 
18:491:32529:28:27:72:508:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:other areas generally dominated by more concrete measures.  Here we find that grades and 
18:492:32618:27:28:72:527:378:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:disciplinary incidents have a substantial impact on the probability of enrolling in college, even 
18:493:32716:28:28:72:519:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:after controlling for cognitive ability, family background, and high school achievement.  The 
18:494:32810:28:27:72:533:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of non-cognitive skill is comparable in magnitude to socio-economic status and cognitive 
18:495:32906:27:28:72:514:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ability.  Given the importance in college attendance decisions, it is likely that non-cognitive 
18:496:33002:28:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:factors influence employment, occupation choice, and a variety of other labor market outcomes.
