2:27:1179:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:We examine the evidence on episodes of large stances in fiscal policy, both in cases of fiscal stimuli
2:28:1281:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:and in that of fiscal adjustments in OECD countries from 1970 to 2007. Fiscal stimuli based upon
2:29:1377:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:tax cuts are more likely to increase growth than those based upon spending increases. As for fiscal
2:30:1476:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:adjustments, those based upon spending cuts and no tax increases are more likely to reduce deficits
2:31:1575:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:and debt over GDP ratios than those based upon tax increases. In addition, adjustments on the spending
2:32:1677:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:side rather than on the tax side are less likely to create recessions. We confirm these results with simple

3:47:2042:0:25:125:224:651:209:Times:209:Times:C:1  Introduction
3:48:2057:25:14:125:483:626:121:Times:121:Times:B:As a result of thefiscal response to thefinancial crisis of 2007-2009 the US will
3:49:2138:14:13:125:484:612:121:Times:121:Times:B:experience the largest increases in deficits and debt accumulation in peacetime.
3:50:2218:13:14:125:484:599:121:Times:121:Times:B:Virtually all other OECD countries will also facefiscal imbalances of various sizes.
3:51:2302:14:13:125:484:585:121:Times:121:Times:B:After the large reduction in government deficits of the nineties and early new cen-
3:52:2385:13:14:125:383:572:121:Times:121:Times:B:tury, publicfinances in the OECD are back in the deep red.
3:53:2443:14:13:142:484:558:121:Times:121:Times:A:Only a few months ago the key policy question was whether tax cuts or spend-
3:54:2519:13:14:125:484:545:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing increases were a better recipe for the stimulus plan in the US and other countries
3:55:2605:14:13:125:484:531:121:Times:121:Times:B:as well. By and large these decisions have been taken, and we are in the process
3:56:2685:13:14:125:484:518:121:Times:121:Times:B:of observing the results. The next question which governments all over the world
3:57:2765:14:14:125:484:504:121:Times:121:Times:B:will face next year, assuming, as it seems likely, that a recovery next year will be
3:58:2849:14:13:125:484:490:121:Times:121:Times:B:under way, is how to stop the growth of debt and return to more “normal” public
3:59:2928:13:14:125:163:477:121:Times:121:Times:B:finances.
3:60:2937:14:13:142:484:463:121:Times:121:Times:A:Thefirst question, namely whether tax cuts or spending increases are more
3:61:3010:13:14:125:484:450:121:Times:121:Times:B:expansionary is a critical one, and economists strongly disagree about the answer.
3:62:3092:14:13:125:484:436:121:Times:121:Times:B:It is fair to say that we know relatively little about the effect offiscal policy on
3:63:3176:13:14:125:483:423:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth and in particular about the so calledfiscal multipliers, namely how much
3:64:3255:14:13:125:484:409:121:Times:121:Times:B:one dollar of tax cuts or spending increases translates in terms of GDP. The issue is
3:65:3340:13:14:125:484:396:121:Times:121:Times:B:very politically charged as well, since right of center economists and policymakers
3:66:3423:14:14:125:484:382:121:Times:121:Times:B:believe in tax cuts and the left of center ones believe in spending increases. While
3:67:3507:14:13:125:484:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:the differences are often rooted in different views about the role of government and
3:68:3591:13:14:125:484:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:inequality, not so much about the size offiscal multipliers, both sides also wish
3:69:3672:14:13:125:484:341:121:Times:121:Times:B:to "sell" their prescription as growth enhancing and more so than the other policy.
3:70:3755:13:14:125:371:328:121:Times:121:Times:B:Unfortunately both sides can’t be right at the same time!
3:71:3812:14:13:142:484:314:121:Times:121:Times:A:As far as reduction of large public debts the lesson from history is reasonably
3:72:3891:13:14:125:484:301:121:Times:121:Times:B:optimistic. Large debt/GDP ratios have been cut relatively rapidly by sustained
3:73:3970:14:13:125:484:287:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth. This was the case of post WWII public debts in belligerent countries; it
3:74:4050:13:14:125:484:274:121:Times:121:Times:B:was also the case of the US in the nineties when without virtually any increase in
3:75:4132:14:13:125:484:260:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax rates or significant spending cuts, a large deficit turned in a large surplus.1In
3:76:4217:13:14:125:484:247:121:Times:121:Times:B:the UK the debt over GDP ratio at the end of WWII was over 200 percent but that
3:77:4296:14:14:125:484:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:country did not suffer afinancial crisis due to its historically crediblefiscal stance
3:78:4382:14:13:125:484:219:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the debt was gradually and relatively rapidly reduced. However, it would be
3:79:4461:13:14:125:484:206:121:Times:121:Times:B:probably too optimistic to expect another decade like the nineties ahead of us;
3:80:4540:14:13:125:484:192:121:Times:121:Times:B:that kind of sustained growth would certainly do a lot to reduce the debt/GDP
3:81:4617:13:14:125:484:179:121:Times:121:Times:B:ratio but the lower growth which we will most likely experience will do much
3:82:4693:14:13:125:484:165:121:Times:121:Times:B:less. Inflation also has the effect of chipping away the real value of the debt but
3:83:4776:13:18:125:484:152:121:Times:121:Times:B:it may be a medicine worse than the disease. While a period of controlled and
3:84:4853:18:0:137:437:134:58:Times:82:Times:?:1See Alesina (1998) for a discussion of the budget surplus in the nineties in the US.
4:85:4939:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:moderate inflation would have the potential to reduce the real value of outstanding
4:86:5022:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:debt, pursuing such a strategy would run the risk of uncontrolled inflation. It took a
4:87:5108:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:sharp recession in the early eighties to eliminate the great inflation of the seventies,
4:88:5196:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the last thing we need is another major recession in the medium run. The post
4:89:5277:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:WWI hyperinflations are certainly not in the horizon, but we should keep them in
4:90:5357:14:14:125:453:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:the back of our mind as an extreme case of debt induced runaway inflation.
4:91:5431:14:13:142:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:A:If growth alone cannot do it and inflating away the debt carries substantial risks,
4:92:5514:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:we are left with the accumulation of budget surpluses to reign in the debt in the next
4:93:5600:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:several years in the post crisis era. But then the same question returns: is raising
4:94:5684:13:14:125:439:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:taxes or cutting spending more likely to result in a stablefiscal outlook?
4:95:5758:14:13:142:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:A:This is precisely what this papers is about. We focus upon large changes in
4:96:5833:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:fiscal policy stance, namely large increase or reduction of budget deficits and we
4:97:5915:14:13:125:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:look at what effects they had on both the economy and the dynamics of the debt.
4:98:5994:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:In particular, for the case of budget expansions (increase in deficits or reduction of
4:99:6080:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:surpluses) we look at which have been more expansionary on growth. Onfiscal
4:100:6155:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:adjustments (deficit reductions) we consider their effect on a medium term stabi-
4:101:6236:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:lization/reduction of the debt over GDP level and their cost in terms of a downturn
4:102:6319:14:13:125:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the economy. We focus only on largefiscal changes because we try to isolate
4:103:6397:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:changes infiscal policy which are policy induced as opposed to cyclicalfluctua-
4:104:6476:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:tions of the deficits, which in any event we try to cyclically adjust. Our method-
4:105:6558:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:ology is rather simple. We identify episodes of large changes infiscal policy. Ob-
4:106:6640:14:13:125:484:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:viously the decision of when to engage is such policy changes is not exogenous to
4:107:6721:13:14:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:the state of publicfinances and of the economy. But up to a point the decision of
4:108:6802:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:whether to act upon the spending side or the revenue side is largely political and
4:109:6884:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:due to bargaining amongst political and pressure groups. The uncertainty about
4:110:6962:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:the size offiscal multipliers make this discussion even less constrained by solid
4:111:7043:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic arguments. Thus we cannot offer new measures offiscal multipliers, but
4:112:7122:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:we can look at what effects have different approaches (spending versus revenue
4:113:7200:14:13:125:351:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:side) have had during and after largefiscal changes.
4:114:7252:13:14:142:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:A:Our results suggest that tax cuts are more expansionary than spending increases
4:115:7331:14:13:125:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:in the cases of afiscal stimulus. Forfiscal adjustments we show that spending cuts
4:116:7413:13:14:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:are much more effective than tax increases in stabilizing the debt and avoiding
4:117:7492:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic downturns. In fact, we uncover several episodes in which spending cuts
4:118:7571:13:14:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:adopted to reduce deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather
4:119:7650:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:than recessions. We also investigate which components of taxes and spending af-
4:120:7729:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:fect the economy more in these large episodes and we try uncover channels running
4:121:7810:14:14:125:334:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:through private consumption and/or investment.
4:122:7856:14:13:142:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:A:The present paper is more directly related to several ones written in the early
4:123:7935:13:14:125:484:136:121:Times:121:Times:B:nineties using a similar approach toours. Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) were thefirst
4:124:8017:14:0:125:484:122:121:Times:121:Times:B:to argue thatfiscal adjustments (deficit reductions) large, decisive and on the spend-
5:125:8104:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing side could be expansionary. This was the case of Ireland and Denmark in the
5:126:8183:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:eighties which were the episodes studied by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990), but there
5:127:8264:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:were others as then discussed and analyzed by Alesina and Ardagna (1998). The
5:128:8341:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:same authors and Alesina and Perotti (1997) investigate various episodes offiscal
5:129:8422:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:adjustments reaching conclusions similar to that of the present paper. But in this
5:130:8504:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:paper we have many more episodes and weuse more compelling techniques. There
5:131:8580:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:is quite a rich literature that studies the determinants and economic outcomes of
5:132:8661:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:largefiscal adjustments. A non exhaustive-list includes Ardagna (2004), Giavazzi,
5:133:8742:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:Jappelli and Pagano (2000), Huges and McAdam (1999), Lambertini and Tavares
5:134:8817:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:(2000), McDermott and Wescott (1996), Von Hagen and Strauch (2001), Von Ha-
5:135:8892:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:gen, Hughes, and Strauch (2002), and more recently, OECD (2008) and IMF
5:136:8963:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:(2009). Theoretically, expansionary effects offiscal adjustments can go through
5:137:9042:14:13:125:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:both the demand and the supply side. On the demand side, afiscal adjustment
5:138:9117:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:may be expansionary if agents believe that thefiscal tightening generates a change
5:139:9199:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:in regime that “eliminates the need for larger, maybe much more disruptive ad-
5:140:9277:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:justments in the future” (Blanchard (1990)).2Current increases in taxes and/or
5:141:9355:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending cuts perceived as permanent, by removing the danger of sharper and more
5:142:9435:14:13:125:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:costlyfiscal adjustments in the future, generate a positive wealth effect. Consumers
5:143:9519:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:anticipate a permanent increase in their lifetime disposable income and this may
5:144:9599:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:induce an increase in current private consumption and in aggregate demand. The
5:145:9677:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:size of the increase in private consumption would depend, however, on the presence
5:146:9759:14:13:125:484:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:or absence of “liquidity constrained” consumers. An additional channel through
5:147:9837:13:14:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:which currentfiscal policy can influence the economy via its effect on agents’ ex-
5:148:9919:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:pectations is the interest rate. If agents believe that the stabilization is credible and
5:149:10008:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:avoids a default on government debt, they can ask for a lower premium on gov-
5:150:10085:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:ernment bonds. Private demand componentssensitive to the real interest rate can
5:151:10164:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:increase if the reduction in the interest rate paid on government bonds leads to a
5:152:10246:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:reduction in the real interest rate charged to consumers andfirms. The decrease
5:153:10325:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:in interest rate can also lead to the appreciation of stocks and bonds, increasing
5:154:10407:13:14:125:444:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:agents’financial wealth, and triggering a consumption/investment boom.
5:155:10477:14:13:142:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:A:On the supply side, expansionary effects offiscal adjustments work via the la-
5:156:10555:13:14:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:bor market and via the effect that tax increases and/or spending cuts have on the
5:157:10636:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:individual labor supply in a neoclassical model, and on the unions’ fall-back posi-
5:158:10719:13:14:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:tion in imperfectly competitive labor markets (see Alesina and Ardagna (1998) and
5:159:10800:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:Alesina et al. (2000) for a review of the literature). In the latter context, the compo-
5:160:10888:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:sition of currentfiscal policy (whether the deficit reduction is achieved through tax
5:161:10973:14:14:125:484:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:increases or through spending cuts) is critical for its effect on the economy. On the
5:162:11058:14:17:125:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:B:one hand, a decrease in government employment reduces the probability offinding

6:164:11231:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:a job if not employed in the private sector, and a decrease in government wages
6:165:11310:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreases the worker’s income if employed in the public sector. In both cases, the
6:166:11392:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:reservation utility of the union members goes down and the wage demanded by
6:167:11467:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:the union for private sector workers decreases, increasing profits, investment and
6:168:11549:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:competitiveness. On the other hand, an increase in income taxes or social secu-
6:169:11628:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:rity contributions that reduces the net wage of the worker leads to an increase in
6:170:11710:14:13:125:488:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:the pre-tax real wage faced by the employer, squeezing profits,investment,and
6:171:11787:13:14:125:198:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:competitiveness.
6:172:11803:14:13:142:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:A:This is not the place to review in detail the large literature on the effect offis-
6:173:11886:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:cal policy on the economy. It is worth mentioning that Romer and Romer (2007)
6:174:11963:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:also follow an event approach even though they identify events of large discre-
6:175:12042:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:tionary changes infiscal policy in a very different way from ours. Using a variety
6:176:12124:14:13:125:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:of narrative sources, they identify changes in the US federal tax legislation that
6:177:12206:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:are undertaken either to solve an inherited budget deficit problem or to achieve
6:178:12286:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:long-run goals and estimate the effect of such changes on real output in a VAR
6:179:12364:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:framework. Theyfind that an increase in taxation by 1% of GDP reduces output in
6:180:12443:14:14:125:483:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:the next three years by a maximum of about3% and that the effect is smaller when
6:181:12523:14:13:125:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:the only changes in taxes considered are those taken to reduce past budget deficits.
6:182:12607:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:As Romer and Romer (2007), we alsofind that tax increases are contractionary, but
6:183:12688:14:13:125:483:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:the magnitudes of our results are difficult to compare to theirs. In our estimates, we
6:184:12774:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:find that a 1% increase in the cyclically adjusted tax revenue decreases real growth
6:185:12858:14:13:125:484:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:by less than one-third of a percentage point. However, we estimate a very different
6:186:12941:13:14:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:specification and, contrary to Romer and Romer (2007), our approach also controls
6:187:13022:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:for changes in government spending undertaken to reduce budget deficits as well
6:188:13101:13:14:125:239:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:as for changes in taxation.
6:189:13128:14:14:142:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:A:Blanchard and Perotti (2002) use structurally VAR techniques to identify ex-
6:190:13204:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:ogenous changes infiscal policy and estimatefiscal multipliers both on the tax and
6:191:13286:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:on the spending side of the government. Theyfind that positive government spend-
6:192:13366:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing shocks increase output, consumption anddecrease investment, while positive
6:193:13444:13:14:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax shocks have a negative effect on output, consumption and investment. Mount-
6:194:13523:14:13:125:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:ford and Uhlig (2008) use a very different identification approach and, while they
6:195:13605:13:14:125:483:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:alsofind that both taxes and spending increases have a negative effect on private
6:196:13686:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:investment (as previously shown by Alesina et al. (2002)), they show that spending
6:197:13768:13:14:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:increases do not generate an increase in consumption and that deficit-financed tax
6:198:13850:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:cuts are the most effective way to stimulate the economy. The result of a positive
6:199:13932:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:effect of government spending shocks on private consumption is also challenged
6:200:14010:14:14:125:483:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:by Ramey (2008). Shefinds that, capturing the timing of the news about govern-
6:201:14088:14:13:125:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:B:ment spending increases with a narrative approach and not with delay as in a VAR
6:202:14168:13:14:125:484:136:121:Times:121:Times:B:approach, consumption declines after increases in government spending. Our re-
6:203:14246:14:0:125:484:122:121:Times:121:Times:B:sults on the negative correlation between both spending and tax increases on GDP
7:204:14327:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth are clearly consistent with the results of these papers using quite different
7:205:14411:14:13:125:290:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:methodological approaches than ours.
7:206:14447:13:14:142:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:A:A substantial literature has investigated political and institutional effects on
7:207:14527:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:fiscal policy and in particular on the propensity of different parties in different
7:208:14610:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:institutional settings to prolongfiscal imbalances, or to reign them in promptly. On
7:209:14694:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:delayedfiscal adjustments see Alesina and Drazen (1999), on politico institutional
7:210:14776:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:effects, like the role of electoral laws, on the occurrence of loose or tightfiscal
7:211:14859:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:policy see Persson and Tabellini (2003) and Milesi Ferretti, Perotti and Rostagno
7:212:14940:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:(2002). Alesina Perotti and Tavares (1998) using an approach similar to that of
7:213:15019:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:the present paper and based upon "episodes", investigate which parties are more
7:214:15098:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:or less likely to run infiscal stimuli orfiscal adjustments. One criticism that one
7:215:15181:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:could raise to the literature on voting rules and institutions onfiscal imbalances is
7:216:15266:14:13:125:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:that rules are not exogenous and third factors may indeed explain both the adoption
7:217:15349:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:of certain voting rule (like proportional representation) andfiscal policy, a point
7:218:15432:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:discussed in Alesina and Glaeser (2004) informally and Aghion Alesina and Trebbi
7:219:15512:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:(2007) more formally. We do not pursue in the present paper this politico economic

7:221:15603:14:13:142:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:A:This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our data and the defin-
7:222:15682:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:ition of episode which we adopt. Section 3 presents basis statistics on the episodes
7:223:15766:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:showing rather striking results. Section4 shows some regression analysis, which
7:224:15845:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:although it has no pretence of having solved causality problems reinforces the re-
7:225:15927:14:35:125:468:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:sults obtained by the simple statisticsof Section 3. The last section concludes.

7:227:16043:25:21:125:219:306:145:Times:145:Times:C:2.1  Methodology
7:228:16059:21:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:Our approach is very simple. We identify major changes infiscal policy, either
7:229:16137:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:expansionary (deficit increases or surplus reductions) or the opposite. Obviously
7:230:16218:13:14:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:the decision about whether to engage in this policy changes is endogenous to the
7:231:16298:14:13:125:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:state of the economy and of thefinances However we assume that at least up to a
7:232:16377:13:14:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:point the decision of whether or not to act on the spending side or the revenue side
7:233:16461:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:of the government is dictated by political preferences and political bargain which
7:234:16543:13:14:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:is, at least to a point, exogenous to the economy and generated by ideological or
7:235:16624:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:policy preferences. Looking at the debates proceeding majorfiscal changes, and
7:236:16702:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:considering the high degree of uncertainty about the size offiscal multipliers this
7:237:16785:14:14:125:484:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:assumption holds some water. Thus our only emphasis is on the effects of different
7:238:16867:14:13:125:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:B:composition offiscal stimuli and adjustments. We cannot and do not compute the
7:239:16945:13:14:125:484:136:121:Times:121:Times:B:size offiscal multipliers. We only compare the effects of different compositions of
7:240:17028:14:0:125:218:122:121:Times:121:Times:B:majorfiscal changes.
8:241:17049:0:21:125:241:651:145:Times:145:Times:C:2.2  Data and Sources
8:242:17070:21:14:125:484:630:121:Times:121:Times:B:We use a panel of OECD countries for a maximum time period from 1970 to 2007.
8:243:17147:14:13:125:484:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:The countries included in the sample are: Australia, Austria,Belgium, Canada,
8:244:17224:13:14:125:484:603:121:Times:121:Times:B:Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
8:245:17302:14:13:125:484:589:121:Times:121:Times:B:New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom,
8:246:17376:13:14:125:484:576:121:Times:121:Times:B:and United States. Allfiscal and macroeconomic data are from the OECD Eco-
8:247:17450:14:13:125:267:562:121:Times:121:Times:B:nomic Outlook Database no. 84.
8:248:17480:13:14:142:484:549:121:Times:121:Times:A:Our approach identifies episodes of large changes in thefiscal stance and stud-
8:249:17559:14:14:125:484:535:121:Times:121:Times:B:ies the behavior offiscal and macroeconomic variables around those episodes to
8:250:17637:14:13:125:484:521:121:Times:121:Times:B:investigate whether different characteristics offiscal packages are correlated with
8:251:17720:13:14:125:484:508:121:Times:121:Times:B:different macroeconomic outcomes. More specifically, we focus both on the size
8:252:17798:14:13:125:484:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:of thefiscal packages (i.e.: the magnitude of the change of the government deficit)
8:253:17881:13:14:125:484:481:121:Times:121:Times:B:and on its composition (i.e.: the percentage change of the main government budget
8:254:17962:14:13:125:484:467:121:Times:121:Times:B:items relative to the total change) and we investigate whether largefiscal stimuli
8:255:18044:13:14:125:484:454:121:Times:121:Times:B:and adjustments that differ in size and composition are associated with booms or
8:256:18124:14:13:125:484:440:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic recessions (as defined below) and whether governments that implement
8:257:18201:13:14:125:484:427:121:Times:121:Times:B:different types offiscal adjustments are successful / unsuccessful in reducing gov-
8:258:18284:14:13:125:185:413:121:Times:121:Times:B:ernment debt.
8:259:18297:13:14:142:484:400:121:Times:121:Times:A:We use a cyclically adjusted value of thefiscal variables to leave aside vari-
8:260:18375:14:14:125:484:386:121:Times:121:Times:B:ations of thefiscal variables induced by business cyclefluctuations. The cyclical
8:261:18456:14:13:125:484:372:121:Times:121:Times:B:adjustment is based on the method proposed by Blanchard (1993). It is a simple
8:262:18534:13:14:125:484:359:121:Times:121:Times:B:method and rather transparent, which corrects various component of the govern-
8:263:18612:14:13:125:484:345:121:Times:121:Times:B:ment budget for year to year changes in the unemployment rate. More precisely,
8:264:18690:13:14:125:484:332:121:Times:121:Times:B:the cyclically adjusted value of the change in afiscal variable is the difference be-
8:265:18775:14:13:125:484:318:121:Times:121:Times:B:tween a measure of thefiscal variable in periodtcomputed as if the unemployment
8:266:18854:13:14:125:484:305:121:Times:121:Times:B:rate were equal to the one int−1 and the actual value of thefiscal variable in year
8:267:18937:14:13:125:484:291:121:Times:121:Times:B:t−1.3We prefer this method to more complicated measures like those produced
8:268:19012:13:14:125:484:278:121:Times:121:Times:B:by the OECD because the latter are abit of a black box based upon many assump-
8:269:19090:14:14:125:484:264:121:Times:121:Times:B:tions aboutfiscal multipliers upon which there is much uncertainty. Based on our
8:270:19170:14:13:125:484:250:121:Times:121:Times:B:previous work (Alesina and Ardagna (1998)) we are confident that for the large
8:271:19248:13:14:125:484:237:121:Times:121:Times:B:episodes which we consider the details of how to adjust for the cycle do not matter
8:272:19331:14:13:125:484:223:121:Times:121:Times:B:much for the qualitative nature of the results. In fact, even not correcting at all
8:273:19414:13:18:125:245:210:121:Times:58:Times:B:would give similar results.4

8:275:19532:14:11:125:484:178:82:Times:82:Times:F:equal to the one int−1, we follow the procedure in Alesina and Perotti (1995). Specifically, for

8:277:19718:11:11:125:484:156:82:Times:82:Times:F:and on the unemployment rate. Then, using the coefficients and the residuals from the estimated
8:278:19813:11:11:125:484:145:82:Times:82:Times:F:regressions, we predict what the value of thefiscal variable as a share of GDP in period t would have
8:279:19914:11:8:125:372:134:82:Times:82:Times:F:been if the unemployment rate were the same as in the previous year.

9:281:20027:0:33:125:280:651:145:Times:145:Times:C:2.3  Definition of the episodes
9:282:20058:33:14:125:483:618:121:Times:121:Times:B:To identify episodes offiscal adjustments andfiscal stimuli we focus on large
9:283:20135:14:37:125:347:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:changes offiscal policy and use the following rule.
9:284:20186:37:26:125:318:567:121:Times:121:Times:B:Definition 1Fiscal adjustments and stimuli
9:285:20228:26:13:142:484:541:121:Times:121:Times:A:Aperiodoffiscal adjustment (stimulus) is a year in which the cyclically ad-
9:286:20303:13:26:125:467:528:121:Times:121:Times:B:justed primary balance improves (deteriorates) by at least 1.5 per cent of GDP.
9:287:20382:26:13:142:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:A:These are rather demanding criteria, which rule out small, but prolonged, ad-
9:288:20459:13:14:125:484:489:121:Times:121:Times:B:justments/stimuli. We have chosen them because we are particularly interested in
9:289:20539:14:13:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:episodes which are very sharp and large and clearly indicate a change in thefis-
9:290:20619:13:14:125:484:462:121:Times:121:Times:B:cal stance. This definition missesfiscal adjustments and stimuli which are small
9:291:20699:14:13:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:in each year but prolonged for several years. It would be quite difficult to come
9:292:20780:13:14:125:484:435:121:Times:121:Times:B:up with a definition that captured the many possible pattern of multi years small
9:293:20861:14:14:125:484:421:121:Times:121:Times:B:adjustments. Thus, the study of these episodes gives a clue on what happens with
9:294:20941:14:13:125:315:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:sharp and brief changes in thefiscal stance.
9:295:20985:13:14:142:484:394:121:Times:121:Times:A:We use the primary deficit, (i.e.: the difference between current and capital
9:296:21062:14:13:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending, excluding interest rate expenses paid on government debt, and total tax
9:297:21143:13:14:125:484:367:121:Times:121:Times:B:revenue)5rather than the total deficit, to avoid that episodes selected result from the
9:298:21230:14:13:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:effect that changes in interest rates have on total government expenditures. Using
9:299:21312:13:14:125:484:340:121:Times:121:Times:B:these criteria we try to focus as much as possible on episodes that do not result from
9:300:21398:14:13:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:the automatic response offiscal variables to economic growth or monetary pol-
9:301:21475:13:14:125:483:313:121:Times:121:Times:B:icy induced changes on interest rates, but they should reflect discretionary policy
9:302:21558:14:13:125:484:299:121:Times:121:Times:B:choices offiscal authorities. Needless to say, there can still be an endogeneity issue
9:303:21644:13:14:125:484:286:121:Times:121:Times:B:related to the occurrence offiscal adjustments and expansions, because, in princi-
9:304:21726:14:14:125:484:272:121:Times:121:Times:B:ple, discretionary policy choices offiscal authorities can be affected by countries’
9:305:21810:14:13:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:macroeconomic conditions. However, note that the budget for the current year is
9:306:21889:13:14:125:484:245:121:Times:121:Times:B:approved during the second half of the previous year and, even though additional
9:307:21969:14:13:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:measures can be taken during the course of the year, they usually become effective
9:308:22051:13:14:125:387:218:121:Times:121:Times:B:with some delay, generally toward the end of thefiscal year.
9:309:22111:14:13:142:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:A:Definition 1 selects 107 periods offiscal adjustments (15.1% of the observa-
9:310:22187:13:14:125:483:191:121:Times:121:Times:B:tions in our sample) and 91 periods offiscal stimuli (12.9% of the observations
9:311:22266:14:13:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:in our sample). Table A1 in appendix lists all of them. Of the 107 episodes of
9:312:22344:13:14:125:484:164:121:Times:121:Times:B:fiscal adjustments, 65 last only for one period, while the rest are multiperiods ad-
9:313:22428:14:17:125:484:150:121:Times:121:Times:B:justments. The majority of the latter (13) last for two consecutive years, 4 are

10:316:22680:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:episode lasting 4 consecutive years. As forfiscal stimuli, 52 episodes last one pe-

10:318:22846:14:13:125:409:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:definition 1 selectsfiscal stimuli that last for 3 consecutive years.
10:319:22915:13:14:142:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:A:We are interested in two outcomes of very tight and very loosefiscal poli-
10:320:22989:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:cies: whether they are associated with an expansion in economic activity during
10:321:23068:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:and in their immediate aftermath and whether they are associated with a reduc-
10:322:23146:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:tion in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Thus, an episode is defined expansionary
10:323:23224:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:accordingtodefinition 2 and successful according to definition 3; we define con-
10:324:23304:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:tractionary/unsuccessful all the episodes offiscal stimuli and adjustments that are
10:325:23387:14:37:125:381:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:not expansionary/successful according to these definitions.

10:327:23506:38:13:142:484:440:121:Times:121:Times:A:An episode offiscal adjustment (fiscal stimulus) is expansionary if the average
10:328:23585:13:14:125:484:427:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth rate of GDP, in difference from the G7 average (weighted by GDP weights),
10:329:23665:14:13:125:484:413:121:Times:121:Times:B:in thefirst period of the episode and in the two years after is greater than the
10:330:23745:13:14:125:484:400:121:Times:121:Times:B:value of 75th percentile of the same variable empirical density in all episodes of
10:331:23827:14:13:125:484:386:121:Times:121:Times:B:fiscal adjustments (fiscal stimuli). This definitions selects 26 years of expansionary
10:332:23913:13:14:125:484:373:121:Times:121:Times:B:periods duringfiscal adjustments (3.7% of theobservations of the entire OECD
10:333:23989:14:13:125:484:359:121:Times:121:Times:B:sample) and 20 years of expansionary periods duringfiscal stimuli (2.8% of the
10:334:24067:13:38:125:410:346:121:Times:301:Times:B:observations of the entire OECD sample). See table A2 for a list.

10:338:24328:13:14:125:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:than 4.5 percentage points (the value of 25th percentile of the change of the debt-to-
10:339:24414:14:13:125:484:230:121:Times:121:Times:B:GDP ratio empirical density in all episodes offiscal adjustments).6This definitions
10:340:24497:13:14:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:selects 17 periods of successfulfiscal adjustments (2.7% of the observations of the
10:341:24580:14:14:125:439:203:121:Times:121:Times:B:entire OECD sample). In Table A3 inAppendix we list all the episodes.
10:342:24649:14:13:142:484:189:121:Times:121:Times:A:We have experimented with variation of the threshold of these definitions but
10:343:24726:13:17:125:484:176:121:Times:121:Times:B:the results are robust, that is they do not change significantly as result of small
10:344:24809:17:15:137:484:159:58:Times:82:Times:F:6If an episode of tightfiscal policy takes place in 2005, the cumulative change of the debt-to-
10:345:24904:15:11:125:484:144:82:Times:82:Times:F:GDP ratio is computed over a two years horizon, not to loose too many observations at the end of
10:346:25000:11:11:125:484:133:82:Times:82:Times:F:the sample. If the episode occurs after 2005, we cannot determine whether it is a successful or an
10:347:25098:11:0:125:188:122:82:Times:82:Times:F:unsuccessful one.
11:348:25116:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:changes of the definitions. A value of 1.5 change in deficits in a year is suffi-
11:349:25197:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:ciently high to eliminate years of "business as usual" in whichfluctuations of the
11:350:25279:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:deficits may just be only cyclical. However it is not so large as to have very few
11:351:25361:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:data points. Also, our “horizon” for the definition of “expansionary” and “success”
11:352:25444:13:14:125:483:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:is relatively short. Choosing a longer horizon has two problems. First, one looses
11:353:25526:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:many observations at the end of the sample; second, and more importantly, choos-
11:354:25606:14:13:125:483:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing a longer horizon makes the connection between the episodes and economic
11:355:25681:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:outcomes several years later more tenuous, given the extent of intervening factors.
11:356:25764:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:Finally, note that according to definition 2 and 3, multiyearsfiscal adjustments and
11:357:25848:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:stimuli are considered as a "single" episode because the length of the time horizon
11:358:25931:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:chosen for the definition of “expansionary” and “success” starts from thefirst year
11:359:26014:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:of the episode. Alesina and Ardagna (1998), Alesina, Perotti and Tavares (1998),
11:360:26094:14:13:125:483:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:instead, consider each year of a multiyearperiod as a single episode. This implies
11:361:26176:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:that, in a multiyear episode, some years canbe expansionary, some contractionary,
11:362:26257:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:some can be successful, some unsuccessful. While we have no reason to prefer one
11:363:26337:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:choice over the other, wefind reassuring that results are robust to these alternative
11:364:26422:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:methods used to select expansionary and successful episodes that last more than
11:365:26501:14:35:125:223:420:121:Times:58:Times:B:one consecutive year.7
11:366:26523:35:25:125:238:385:209:Times:209:Times:C:3  Basic Statistics
11:367:26542:25:21:125:220:360:145:Times:145:Times:C:3.1  Fiscal stimuli
11:368:26561:21:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:Let’s begin by analyzing what happens withfiscal stimuli, namely whether we can
11:369:26640:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:detect differences in the effects offiscal packages depending on their composition
11:370:26722:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:on the economy. Table 1 shows the composition in terms of spending components
11:371:26799:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:and revenue components of the 20 years of expansionaryfiscal stimulus packages
11:372:26877:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:versus the others. In Tables 1-6, the period [T−2,T−1] is the two year period
11:373:26954:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:preceding thefirst year of afiscal stimulus/adjustment. The period [T]isthefirst
11:374:27034:13:14:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:year and the period [T+1,T+2] is the two year period following the beginning
11:375:27110:14:13:125:411:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:of an episode.8All the variables in the tables are yearly averages.
11:376:27177:13:14:142:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:A:The most striking result of this table is that in expansionary episodes total
11:377:27254:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending increases by roughly 1 per cent of GDP while revenues fall by more
11:378:27329:13:18:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:than 2.5 per cent of GDP. Incontractionary episodes total spending goes up by
11:379:27406:18:11:137:399:186:58:Times:82:Times:?:7More details on these sensitivity analysis are available from the authors.
11:380:27481:11:14:137:484:175:58:Times:82:Times:F:8The Denmarkfiscal contraction is the only episode lasting 4 years. We have included the values
11:381:27576:14:11:125:484:161:82:Times:82:Times:F:of the variables in 1986 in the column [T+1,T+2]. We checked and confirm that the qualitative
11:382:27669:11:11:125:484:150:82:Times:82:Times:F:nature of the results does not change if the period [T] inlcudes all the years of a tight/expansionary
11:383:27771:11:11:125:484:139:82:Times:82:Times:F:episode offiscal policy and the period [T+1,T+2] is the two year period following the last year
11:384:27866:11:0:125:175:128:82:Times:82:Times:F:of an episode.
12:385:27882:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:close to 3 per cent of GDP while revenues are roughly constant in terms of GDP.
12:386:27961:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:This correlation seems to suggest that stimulus packages used upon the spending
12:387:28040:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:side do not work or at least not as well as those based upon spending increases.
12:388:28120:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:In terms of components of spending we note that there is no difference between
12:389:28198:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:expansionary and contractionary episodes regarding public investment which goes
12:390:28277:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:up by roughly the same amount in ratios of GDP. All the other components of
12:391:28352:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:primary spending and, in particular transfers, go up much more in contractionary
12:392:28432:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:episodes. This suggests that the non public investment components of the bud-
12:393:28509:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:get are those which explain the different correlation with growth. As for revenues
12:394:28591:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:note the large cut in income taxes in expansionary stimuli and the slight increase
12:395:28673:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:in contractionary ones. Not surprisingly the debt over GDP ratio goes up less in
12:396:28753:13:14:125:393:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:expansionary episodes since the denominator increases more.
12:397:28812:14:13:142:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:A:Figure 1 offers a striking visual image of the different compositions in terms
12:398:28890:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:of revenues and spending of expansionary and contractionary episodes. Thefirst
12:399:28968:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:two comparison of total spending and revenues are rather striking even visually.
12:400:29048:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:In Table 2 we look at the different components of GDP to check whether there
12:401:29124:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:are difference in composition between expansionary and contractionary episodes.
12:402:29203:14:13:125:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:Thefirst two lines which refer to GDP growth are somewhat obvious since they
12:403:29279:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:reflect the selection criteria of these episodes. All the components of aggregate
12:404:29360:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:demand grow more after the stimulus in expansionary episodes. This result is a
12:405:29438:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:bit different than that reported in Alesina and Ardagna (1998). In that sample the
12:406:29520:14:13:125:484:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:difference between the two types of episodes seemed concentrated on investment
12:407:29598:13:14:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:rather than consumption.9In this sample both consumption and investment behave
12:408:29676:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:differently, both increasing in expansionary cases and declining in contractionary
12:409:29758:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:ones. This table also allows us to check whether the state of the economy before
12:410:29838:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:the adjustments was different in the two groups. In terms of domestic growth and
12:411:29918:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:relative to G7 average, expansionary episodes occurred when growth was higher.
12:412:29996:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:As for the other components the only significant difference seem to be in the trade
12:413:30079:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:balance. It is obviously cavalier to draw broad conclusions from this but enormous
12:414:30161:13:30:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:differences in the preexisting state of the economy do not jump out from this table.
12:415:30245:30:21:125:247:228:145:Times:145:Times:C:3.2  Fiscal adjustments
12:416:30268:21:13:125:484:207:121:Times:121:Times:B:Fiscal adjustments can be judged in two ways, as discussed above. One is about
12:417:30346:13:14:125:484:194:121:Times:121:Times:B:whether they have been successful in significantly reducing deficits and the debt
12:418:30427:14:13:125:484:180:121:Times:121:Times:B:over GDP ratios and second whether they have been associated with a reduction
12:419:30504:13:14:125:484:167:121:Times:121:Times:B:in growth or not. Obviously, the two criteria are correlated since a growth en-
12:420:30583:14:16:125:484:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:hancing adjustment is more likely to be successful in reducing the debt-to-GDP
12:421:30661:16:15:137:484:137:58:Times:82:Times:F:9See Also Alesina, Ardagna Perotti and Schiantarelli (2002) for related work on the effect of
12:422:30754:15:0:125:223:122:82:Times:82:Times:F:fiscal policy on investment.
13:423:30784:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:ratio. However, the correlation is not perfect since afiscal adjustment may lead to
13:424:30867:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:a sharp reduction of the debt/GDP ratiobecause the numerator drops faster than
13:425:30945:13:14:125:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:the denominator. Episodes with this characteristic, that is the ability to reduce the
13:426:31030:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:debt-to-GDP ratio exist, for example Netherlands in 1993, Norway in 1989, and
13:427:31107:13:14:125:223:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:Sweden in 1986-1987.
13:428:31127:14:14:142:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table 3 is organized in the same way as Table 1 above. The expansionary
13:429:31198:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:episodes offiscal adjustments are mostly characterized by spending cuts. Primary
13:430:31278:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending as a percent of GDP falls by more than 2 per cent. Total revenues in-
13:431:31356:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:stead increase slightly by about 0.34 per cent of GDP. On the other hand, in the
13:432:31436:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:case of contractionaryfiscal adjustments primary spending is cut by about 0.7 per
13:433:31517:14:13:125:484:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:cent of GDP, while revenues increase by about 1.2 per cent of GDP. Thus,fiscal
13:434:31595:13:14:125:484:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:adjustments occurring on the spending side have superior effects on growth than
13:435:31674:14:13:125:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:B:those based upon increases in tax revenues. As far as the composition in compo-
13:436:31753:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:nents probably the most striking difference between the two types of adjustments
13:437:31833:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:has to do with the role of transfers. In contractionary cases transfers continue to
13:438:31916:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth as a percentage of GDP of almost half of a percentage point. In expansion-
13:439:31997:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:ary episodes, instead, transfers fall by roughly the same amount. Thus, in between
13:440:32079:14:13:125:484:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:the two types of episodes there is a very large difference of 1 per cent of GDP in the
13:441:32165:13:14:125:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:B:share of transfers. Looking at the composition of revenues one is struck by income
13:442:32247:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:taxes: they go down quite significantly in expansionary adjustments and go up in
13:443:32327:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:contractionary ones. The difference between the two isalmost 1 percentage point
13:444:32406:14:13:125:442:366:121:Times:121:Times:B:of GDP. This difference is by far the largest among revenue components.
13:445:32477:13:14:142:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:A:Figure 2 is organized in the same way asfigure 1 and even in this case visually
13:446:32556:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:the contrast between the two types offiscal adjustments is quite obvious. When
13:447:32634:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:we look at the different components of GDP, wefind that both consumption and
13:448:32710:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:investment grow more during expansionary episodes. We did not uncover any re-
13:449:32787:14:13:125:484:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:markable composition effects, along the same line a Table 2 displayed forfiscal
13:450:32866:13:14:125:484:285:121:Times:121:Times:B:stimuli. These sample statistics are reported in Table 4 which is organized as Ta-
13:451:32948:14:13:125:484:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:ble 2. The other interesting observation is that at least in terms of GDP growth
13:452:33028:13:14:125:484:258:121:Times:121:Times:B:and growth of its components the preexisting conditions of expansionary and con-
13:453:33108:14:13:125:483:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:tractionary episodes look remarkably similar. One rather remarkable observation
13:454:33187:13:14:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:comes from comparing the growth performance during expansionary stimuli and
13:455:33262:14:13:125:341:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:expansionary adjustments: they are quite similar!
13:456:33311:13:14:142:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:A:Let’s now consider successful versus unsuccessful adjustments as shown in
13:457:33384:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:Table 5. The comparison between the two is especially striking. In successful
13:458:33461:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:episodes total primary spending as a percentage of GDP falls by about 2 per cent
13:459:33541:14:14:125:484:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:of GDP. Total revenues actually declineof about half of percentage point of GDP.
13:460:33621:14:13:125:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:B:Thus, successfulfiscal adjustments are completely based on spending cuts accom-
13:461:33700:13:14:125:484:136:121:Times:121:Times:B:panied by modest tax cuts! On the contrary, in unsuccessful adjustments total
13:462:33777:14:0:125:484:122:121:Times:121:Times:B:revenue goes up by almost 1.5 per cent of GDP and primary spending are cut by
14:463:33856:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:about 0.8 of GDP. Once again this comparison points in the direction of spending
14:464:33936:14:13:125:387:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:cuts as the more successful ways offixing budget problems.
14:465:33994:13:14:142:484:624:121:Times:121:Times:A:Regarding the composition of spending and revenue the most striking com-
14:466:34066:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:parison is given by the transfers item. In successful adjustments transfers fall by
14:467:34149:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:0.83 per cent of GDP, while in unsuccessful adjustments they grow at about 0.4
14:468:34227:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:per cent, a huge difference between the two episodes of 1.2 percent of GDP. This
14:469:34307:14:13:125:483:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:comparison points in a clear direction: it is very difficult if not impossible tofix
14:470:34391:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:publicfinances when in trouble without solving the question of automatic increases
14:471:34473:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:in entitlements. Regarding the composition of revenues, again as above the most
14:472:34552:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:striking difference is on income taxes. Figure 3, once again, gives a striking visual
14:473:34637:14:35:125:223:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:image of these results.
14:474:34660:35:25:125:252:480:209:Times:209:Times:C:4  Some regressions
14:475:34679:25:13:125:484:455:121:Times:121:Times:B:In this section we present some simple regressions on GDP growth as a function
14:476:34757:13:14:125:484:442:121:Times:121:Times:B:of changes offiscal policy in the recent past. We should put up-front the fact that
14:477:34840:14:13:125:484:428:121:Times:121:Times:B:causality issues are all over the place here and we do not claim to have solved them.
14:478:34925:13:14:125:484:415:121:Times:121:Times:B:These regressions should be viewed as correlations, but wefind them instructive
14:479:35004:14:13:125:484:401:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the message which they send is on the same line of that emerging from our
14:480:35081:13:14:125:241:388:121:Times:121:Times:B:descriptive analysis above.
14:481:35108:14:14:142:484:374:121:Times:121:Times:A:Let’s begin withfiscal stimuli. In Table 7, columns 1-4, we regress real GDP
14:482:35184:14:13:125:484:360:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth in a year offiscal stimulus on its one periodand two period lagged values,
14:483:35265:13:14:125:484:347:121:Times:121:Times:B:on the lagged value of the weighted average of the real GDP growth of the G7
14:484:35341:14:13:125:484:333:121:Times:121:Times:B:countries, on the lagged value of the ratio of public debt to GDP ratio and on a
14:485:35421:13:14:125:484:320:121:Times:121:Times:B:set offiscal policy variables measuring the size and the composition of thefiscal
14:486:35502:14:13:125:484:306:121:Times:121:Times:B:stimulus. Columns 5-8 are analogous to the previous 4 columns except for the lhs
14:487:35582:13:14:125:484:293:121:Times:121:Times:B:variable, now equal to the average of real GDP growth in a year offiscal stimulus
14:488:35663:14:13:125:260:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:andinthetwofollowingones.
14:489:35688:13:14:142:484:266:121:Times:121:Times:A:Wefind that, controlling for initial conditions, a one percentage point higher
14:490:35766:14:13:125:484:252:121:Times:121:Times:B:increase in the current spending to GDP ratio is associated with a 0.75 percentage
14:491:35848:13:14:125:484:239:121:Times:121:Times:B:point lower growth. The effect is statistically significant at the 5% level. Instead,
14:492:35933:14:14:125:484:225:121:Times:121:Times:B:larger increases in spending on capital goods or larger cuts in taxes do not have sta-
14:493:36019:14:13:125:484:211:121:Times:121:Times:B:tistically significant effects on growth (see column 2). When we try to investigate
14:494:36102:13:14:125:484:198:121:Times:121:Times:B:whether the size of thefiscal stimulus or its composition is relevant for economic
14:495:36184:14:13:125:484:184:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth, wefind more evidence in favor of the composition. We measure the size of
14:496:36264:13:14:125:484:171:121:Times:121:Times:B:thefiscal stimulus with the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance. We
14:497:36345:14:13:125:484:157:121:Times:121:Times:B:measure the composition offiscal stimuli with two different variables: (i) the ratio
14:498:36429:13:14:125:484:144:121:Times:121:Times:B:between the change in current spending to GDP ratio and the change in the primary
14:499:36510:14:0:125:484:130:121:Times:121:Times:B:balance (columns 3 and 7), and (ii) the sum of the change in current spending and
15:500:36593:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax revenue to GDP ratios (column 4 and 8) to account for the fact that both current
15:501:36677:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending increases and tax increases can be negatively associated with growth.
15:502:36755:13:14:125:488:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:Both measures of composition are statistically significantatthe5%levelinall
15:503:36830:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:specifications. In column 3, the sign of the ratio between the change in current
15:504:36910:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:spending to GDP ratio and the change in the primary balance indicates that the
15:505:36988:14:14:125:484:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:larger the share of the worsening in the primary balance due to spending increases
15:506:37070:14:13:125:484:569:121:Times:121:Times:B:the lower GDP growth. On average, during years offiscal stimuli about 54% of
15:507:37146:13:14:125:484:556:121:Times:121:Times:B:the deterioration in the primary balance is due to increases in current spending
15:508:37226:14:13:125:484:542:121:Times:121:Times:B:items. A one standard deviation increase in this variable (equal to 51%, undoubt-
15:509:37307:13:14:125:484:529:121:Times:121:Times:B:edly a very large number) would reduce growth by 1 percentage point. Finally, a
15:510:37386:14:13:125:486:515:121:Times:121:Times:B:larger increase in the primary deficittoGDPratioisassociatedwithlowergrowth,
15:511:37462:13:14:125:398:502:121:Times:121:Times:B:however, the effect is statistically significant only in column 3.
15:512:37528:14:13:142:484:488:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table 8 is very similar to Table 7 but we replace the change in current spend-
15:513:37606:13:14:125:484:475:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing and taxes with their respective components. Consistent with the evidence in
15:514:37685:14:13:125:484:461:121:Times:121:Times:B:Table 7, our regressions show thatfiscal stimuli more heavily based on increases in
15:515:37768:13:14:125:484:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:current spending items (government wage and non-wage components, subsidies)
15:516:37843:14:14:125:484:434:121:Times:121:Times:B:are associated with lower growth, whilefiscal stimulus packages based on cuts in
15:517:37923:14:13:125:435:420:121:Times:121:Times:B:income, business and indirect taxes are more likely to be expansionary.
15:518:37994:13:14:142:484:407:121:Times:121:Times:A:When we turn to the sample offiscal adjustments (Tables 9 and 10), our results
15:519:38072:14:13:125:484:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:still point in the same direction: namely, the composition of thefiscal adjustment,
15:520:38155:13:14:125:484:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:more than its size, matters for growth andfiscal adjustments associated with higher

15:522:38314:13:14:125:484:353:121:Times:121:Times:B:deficit-to-GDP ratio is due to cuts in current spending, to the government wage
15:523:38393:14:13:125:484:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:and non-wage components, and to subsidies. All this evidence is consistent with
15:524:38472:13:14:125:484:326:121:Times:121:Times:B:the previous literature onfiscal stabilizations and is robust if we introduce among
15:525:38555:14:14:125:484:312:121:Times:121:Times:B:the regressors the change in the short-terminterest rate as a control for the stance

15:529:38873:13:14:142:485:258:121:Times:121:Times:A:Finally, we have estimated the same specifications as in Tables 7 and 9, columns
15:530:38953:14:13:125:484:244:121:Times:121:Times:B:1, 2, and 4 for the entire sample of OECD data that, hence, includes episodes of
15:531:39033:13:14:125:484:231:121:Times:121:Times:B:fiscal adjustments, stimuli and years in which the cyclically adjusted primary bal-
15:532:39116:14:13:125:484:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:ance changes between -1.5% and 1.5%. We have also checked whether there are
15:533:39191:13:14:125:484:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:non-linearities associated with times of largefiscal adjustments and stimuli. Table
15:534:39274:14:13:125:484:190:121:Times:121:Times:B:11 shows the results.10Results are in line with the evidence shown so far: we
15:535:39351:13:14:125:484:177:121:Times:121:Times:B:find that larger reductions in current spending and in taxation are associated with
15:536:39434:14:14:125:484:163:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher GDP growth, while changes in capital spending do not show any significant
15:537:39514:14:17:125:484:149:121:Times:121:Times:B:effect on growth. Moreover, the specifications in columns 4-9, do not support any

16:542:39922:14:13:125:484:610:121:Times:121:Times:B:tistically significant. As suggested by Alesina, Ardagna, Perotti, and Schiantarelli
16:543:40006:13:14:125:484:597:121:Times:121:Times:B:(2002), there seems to be nothing special around such episodes that can explain the
16:544:40089:14:35:125:326:583:121:Times:121:Times:B:behavior of growth relatively to normal times.
16:545:40135:35:25:125:221:548:209:Times:209:Times:C:5  Conclusions
16:546:40149:25:14:125:484:523:121:Times:121:Times:B:Rather than reviewing again our result it isworth elaborating, or perhaps speculat-
16:547:40232:14:13:125:483:509:121:Times:121:Times:B:ing on the current and futurefiscal stance in the US. As we well know a very large
16:548:40314:13:14:125:484:496:121:Times:121:Times:B:portion of the current astronomical 12 percent of GDP deficit is the result of bailout
16:549:40400:14:13:125:484:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:of various types of thefinancial sector. This is an issue on which this paper has
16:550:40481:13:14:125:484:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:nothing to say. But part of the deficit is the result of the stimulus package that was
16:551:40567:14:13:125:484:455:121:Times:121:Times:B:passed to lift the economy out of the recession. About two third of thisfiscal pack-
16:552:40651:13:14:125:484:442:121:Times:121:Times:B:age is constituted by increases in spending, including public investment, transfers
16:553:40734:14:13:125:484:428:121:Times:121:Times:B:and government consumption. According to our resultsfiscal stimuli based upon
16:554:40811:13:14:125:484:415:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax cut are much more likely to be growth enhancing than those on the spending
16:555:40889:14:13:125:484:401:121:Times:121:Times:B:side. Needless to say when considering asingle episode many other factors jump
16:556:40967:13:14:125:484:388:121:Times:121:Times:B:to mind, factors which are difficult to capture in a multi country regressions. For
16:557:41050:14:14:125:484:374:121:Times:121:Times:B:instance, American families were saving too little before the crisis. An income
16:558:41129:14:13:125:484:360:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax cut might have just simply been saved and might have had not a big impact on
16:559:41209:13:14:125:484:347:121:Times:121:Times:B:aggregate consumption. However, more saving might have reinforced thefinan-
16:560:41284:14:13:125:484:333:121:Times:121:Times:B:cial sector, think of the credit card crisis for instance. In addition, one could have
16:561:41370:13:14:125:484:320:121:Times:121:Times:B:though of tax cuts that stimulate investment. The benefit of infrastructure projects
16:562:41454:14:13:125:405:306:121:Times:121:Times:B:which have "long and variable lags" is much more questionable.
16:563:41516:13:14:142:484:293:121:Times:121:Times:A:After the "perfect storm" of this current crisis the US will emerge with an
16:564:41591:14:13:125:484:279:121:Times:121:Times:B:unprecedented (for peace time) increase in government debt. As we argued in the
16:565:41670:13:14:125:484:266:121:Times:121:Times:B:introduction it is unlikely that these deficits and debt will disappear simply because
16:566:41756:14:13:125:484:252:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth will resume at very rapid pace very soon. Primary suppresses would be
16:567:41832:13:14:125:484:239:121:Times:121:Times:B:needed since interest rates cannot go other than up from the close to zero actual
16:568:41913:14:14:125:484:225:121:Times:121:Times:B:levels. The analysis of the present paper suggests that unless primary spending is
16:569:41995:14:13:125:484:211:121:Times:121:Times:B:cut, it is difficult to acheivefiscal stability because spending may rise faster than
16:570:42080:13:14:125:484:198:121:Times:121:Times:B:tax revenue. But what can be cut? Hopefully improvements in the peace process in
16:571:42160:14:13:125:484:184:121:Times:121:Times:B:Afghanistan and Iraq might allow a reduction of military expenditure, but given the
16:572:42243:13:14:125:484:171:121:Times:121:Times:B:instability in the region one cannot count onthat for sure. Health care reforms seem
16:573:42327:14:13:125:484:157:121:Times:121:Times:B:to imply large increases in spending, the retirement of the baby boomers is not too
16:574:42410:13:14:125:484:144:121:Times:121:Times:B:far, and in the pressing time of the crisis the issue of Social Security has been in
16:575:42494:14:0:125:484:130:121:Times:121:Times:B:the background, but it has not disappeared A relatively high unemployment for a
17:576:42575:0:14:125:484:651:121:Times:121:Times:B:couple of more years will require spendingon subsidies. The budget outlook looks
17:577:42655:14:13:125:484:637:121:Times:121:Times:B:rather grim on the spending side. The Congressional Budget Office predicts deficit
17:578:42737:13:35:125:389:624:121:Times:121:Times:B:of 7 per cent of GDP up to 2020. This is not a rosy scenario.
