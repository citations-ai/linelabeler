2:28:1371:28:14:71:539:588:12:Times:12:Times:Two potential driving forces of house price fluctuations are commonly cited: credit conditions and
2:29:1469:14:14:71:539:574:12:Times:12:Times:beliefs. We posit some simple empirical calculations using direct measures of credit conditions and
2:30:1568:14:14:71:539:560:12:Times:12:Times:beliefs to consider their potentially distinct roles in house price fluctuations at the aggregate level.
2:31:1672:14:14:71:539:546:12:Times:12:Times:Changes in credit conditions are positively related to the fraction of riskier non-conforming debt in
2:32:1773:14:14:71:539:532:12:Times:12:Times:total mortgage lending, while measures of beliefs are unrelated to this ratio. Credit conditions explain
2:33:1877:14:14:71:539:518:12:Times:12:Times:quantitatively large magnitudes of the variation in quarterly house price growth and also predict future
2:34:1981:14:14:71:539:504:12:Times:12:Times:house price growth. Beliefs bear some relation to contemporaneous house price growth but have little
2:35:2081:14:14:71:539:490:12:Times:12:Times:predictive power. A structural VAR analysis implies that shocks to credit conditions have quantitatively
2:36:2185:14:42:71:348:476:12:Times:12:Times:important dynamic causal effects on house price changes.

3:48:2449:0:30:64:177:715:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:49:2464:30:18:64:546:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The dawn of the 21st century was marked by a dramatic boom-bust cycle in residential real
3:50:2553:18:18:64:546:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estate prices, a phenomenon of unprecedented magnitude and breadth that a§ected many coun-
3:51:2643:18:18:64:546:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tries and most regions within the United States. This cycle, which roughly spanned the years
3:52:2735:18:18:64:546:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000-2010, has generated keen interest in the origins of house price movements. For brevity,
3:53:2827:18:18:64:547:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we shall refer hereafter to this entire episode as theGreat Housing Cycle(GHC), to the period
3:54:2920:18:18:64:547:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of rapid home price appreciation from 2000 to 2006 as theboom,and to the period 2007 to the
3:55:3011:18:18:64:185:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:end of 2010 as thebust.
3:56:3034:18:17:82:547:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Two potential driving forces of house price áuctuations are commonly cited: credit condi-
3:57:3123:17:18:64:547:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions and beliefs. Perhaps the boom was driven by cheaper and easier access to credit and the
3:58:3216:18:18:64:547:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bust by a subsequent constriction in credit availability. Alternatively, the boom might have
3:59:3308:18:18:64:547:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been propelled by an exuberance about housing unexplained by economic fundamentals, while
3:60:3397:18:18:64:546:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bust came after a negative shift in beliefs. Theoretical studies have yet to reach consensus
3:61:3493:18:18:64:547:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the relative or even absolute importance of these two mechanisms, pointing to the need for
3:62:3586:18:18:64:547:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:empirical evidence.1Yet even empirical researchers looking at similar data sets have arrived
3:63:3678:18:18:64:546:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at divergent conclusions. One set of results suggests that the boom was driven by a nascent
3:64:3769:18:18:64:546:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extension of credit to low-income and subprime borrowers, while the bust was caused by a sub-
3:65:3862:18:18:64:546:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sequent reversal of credit. Evidence commensurate with this idea (e.g., Mian and SuÖ (2009);
3:66:3954:18:18:64:547:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mian and SuÖ (2016)) is often interpreted as consistent with the credit conditions view. Other
3:67:4048:18:18:64:547:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence suggests that the boom was characterized by an increase in mortgage originations to
3:68:4140:18:18:64:546:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households at all income levels, including higher-income and prime borrowers often thought
3:69:4230:18:18:64:546:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to be less constrained by credit conditions than subprime borrowers, while the bust was char-
3:70:4323:18:18:64:546:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:acterized by a rising share of defaults by many of these same higher-income borrowers (e.g.,
3:71:4415:18:17:64:547:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016)). This evidence is often interpreted as consistent with
3:72:4507:17:18:64:547:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the beliefs view, since it comports with the idea that the boom was caused by a broadly-shared
3:73:4601:18:18:64:547:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimism about housing by prime and subprime borrowers alike, while the bust was caused by
3:74:4691:18:18:64:259:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a wide-spread shift toward pessimism.
3:75:4728:18:18:82:547:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Often, the credit conditions view and beliefs view are discussed as if they were mutually
3:76:4817:18:18:64:547:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exclusive possibilities. In reality, both forces could be playing a role at the same time in the
3:77:4913:18:18:64:547:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data.  Greenwald (2017) provides evidence that the vast majority of prime borrowers take
3:78:5001:18:18:64:547:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out the largest mortgage possible given their loan-to-value (LTV) limit and their monthly
3:79:5090:18:19:64:547:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt payment-to-income (PTI) limit2among other eligibility requirements, implying that any
3:80:5180:19:15:78:546:128:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1A growing body of theoretical work has addressed these questions in general equilbrium. See e.g., Davis and
3:81:5288:15:12:64:546:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Heathcote (2005); Campbell and Hercowitz (2006), Kahn (2008), Kiyotaki, Michaelides, and Nikolov (2011),
3:82:5392:12:12:64:546:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Piazzesi and Schneider (2008), Iacoviello and Pavan (2013), Sommer, Sullivan, and Verbrugge (2013), Landvoigt,
3:83:5502:12:12:64:546:89:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Piazzesi, and Schneider (2015), Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2017), Garriga and Hedlund
3:84:5604:12:8:64:368:77:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2017); Greenwald (2017), and Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2017).
3:85:5670:8:0:78:546:69:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2This limit is referred to as the ìdebt-to-incomeîlimit in the mortgage industry even though the numerator
4:86:5777:0:18:64:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:homebuyer who isnít purchasing with cash is likely to be credit constrained or nearly so. Higher
4:87:5873:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income and prime borrowers with more borrowing capacity take out larger mortgages, but are
4:88:5963:18:18:64:546:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not necessarily less constrained than lower income and subprime households. This suggests
4:89:6052:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the relationship between mortgage growth and income growth at the individual level may
4:90:6143:18:18:64:546:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be no more (or no less) informative about credit conditions than it is about beliefs. What is
4:91:6236:18:18:64:464:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:missing from this analysis are direct measures of credit conditions and beliefs.
4:92:6316:18:18:82:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper we posit some simple empirical calculations using direct measures of credit
4:93:6405:18:18:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditions and beliefs to consider their potentially distinct roles as drivers of house price áuctu-
4:94:6505:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ations at the aggregate level. To measure credit conditions, we study a little-utilized indicator
4:95:6602:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of mortgage lending standards from a survey of banks: the Senior Loan O¢ cer Opinion Survey
4:96:6693:18:18:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(SLOOS) conducted by the Federal Reserve. The quarterly survey asks senior loan o¢ cers at
4:97:6783:18:17:64:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks to state whether their lending standards for purchase mortgages have eased or tightened
4:98:6876:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to the previous quarter. We use the net percentage of banks that have eased their
4:99:6966:18:18:64:546:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lending standards on mortgage loans as a measure of credit supply, a variable we denote-CSt.
4:100:7058:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To our knowledge, the only paper that has previously used this measure in the study of house
4:101:7150:18:18:64:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price áuctuations is Favilukis, Kohn, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) (FKLV). We
4:102:7237:18:18:64:546:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:extend this prior analysis by considering an updated sample and a more extensive empirical
4:103:7327:18:18:64:205:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:study using data on beliefs.
4:104:7355:18:18:82:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To measure beliefs, we study four indicators. The Örst three are each distinct household-
4:105:7444:18:18:64:546:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:level survey indicators from the University of Michiganís Survey of Consumers (SOC) that
4:106:7532:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:ask speciÖcally about the respondentís view on home prices. These include an overallbuying
4:107:7622:18:18:64:546:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:conditions index(whether now is a good or bad time to invest in a home), a measure created
4:108:7712:18:18:64:546:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from the fraction of SOC respondents who say that conditions are good because house prices
4:109:7802:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are expected to rise or stay high, and a survey point forecast for house price changes over the
4:110:7897:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:next year (available since 2007).  As a fourth measure of beliefs, we make use of the index
4:111:7988:18:18:64:547:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:constructed by Soo (2018) that measures sentiment about housing based on a textual analysis
4:112:8079:18:17:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of major news publicationsícoverage of the housing market. We then combine these data with
4:113:8169:17:18:64:546:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data on national home prices in order to compile a set of statistical facts on the empirical
4:114:8261:18:18:64:362:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships among these variables at the aggregate level.
4:115:8320:18:18:82:547:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We investigate several hypotheses. One concerns the relationship between credit conditions
4:116:8410:18:18:64:547:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the type of mortgages that are underwritten. If a reported net easing of bank lending
4:117:8499:18:18:64:547:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards means a relaxation of loan-to-value or payment-to-income limits, or more generally a
4:118:8593:18:18:64:547:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater expansion of credit to borrowers previously deemed unqualiÖed according to a stricter
4:119:8686:18:18:64:546:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:set of lending standards, we would expect such easings to be associated with a shift in the com-
4:120:8782:18:21:64:547:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:position of mortgages, away from less risky conforming loans and toward riskier non-conforming
4:121:8876:21:12:64:546:84:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is the monthly debt payment rather than the debt itself. We therefore follow other academic literature and refer
4:122:8988:12:0:64:261:72:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to it as the payment-to-income ratio, or PTI.
5:123:9034:0:18:64:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loans. The converse would be true of a reported net tightening of bank lending standards. By
5:124:9126:18:18:64:546:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contrast, there is no reason to expect a belief-driven change in household demand for mortgages
5:125:9221:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to a§ect the composition of loans, since presumably the demand for all types of credit would
5:126:9313:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:change in rough proportion. So we look at how the SLOOS survey measure of credit supply
5:127:9400:18:18:64:362:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relates to mortgage growth and its composition over time.
5:128:9457:18:18:82:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second and related hypothesis is thatlendersíbeliefs about future home prices altered
5:129:9544:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their willingness to bear mortgage credit risk, with this willingness increasing when they were
5:130:9639:18:18:64:547:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimistic and decreasing when they turned pessimistic. Under this hypothesis, a shift in the
5:131:9732:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:composition of credit toward riskier non-conforming mortgages should occur when beliefs are
5:132:9823:18:18:64:546:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bullish. So we investigate whether our measures of house price beliefs are related to the shifts
5:133:9919:18:18:64:232:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the composition of mortgages.
5:134:9951:18:17:82:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A third question is whether either credit conditions or beliefs contain explanatory power
5:135:10040:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for national home price growth that is independent of the explanatory power contained in
5:136:10128:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the other variable, and in economic fundamentals.  If the two are correlated, but the true
5:137:10218:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explanatory power for house prices lies more with one than the other, this should be revealed
5:138:10311:18:18:64:546:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by a multivariate regression where both variables are included. So we ask whether bank credit
5:139:10404:18:18:64:546:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:supply contains information about current house price growth that is not contained in beliefs
5:140:10497:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(and vice versa). We further investigate which forces are more quantitatively important for
5:141:10588:18:18:64:307:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explaining the variation in house price changes.
5:142:10636:18:18:82:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is important to consider whether beliefs have explanatory power for house prices beyond
5:143:10726:18:18:64:546:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that contained in economic fundamentals. After all, beliefs about house prices evolve endoge-
5:144:10819:18:18:64:546:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nously even in models where beliefs have no independent role to play in economic áuctuations,
5:145:10912:18:18:64:546:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including models in which subjective expectations perfectly align with objective probability laws
5:146:11009:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:governing the behavior of economic fundamentals. An important question for the literature on
5:147:11101:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:behavioral biases is whether beliefs pushed house prices beyond what would be justiÖed by
5:148:11190:18:18:64:547:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamentals alone, in which case beliefs should contain information about house price growth
5:149:11283:18:17:64:546:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that is independent of credit conditions and other economic fundamentals. This is straightfor-
5:150:11377:17:18:64:546:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ward to address with a multivariate analysis that employs data on beliefs, credit conditions,
5:151:11470:18:18:64:209:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and economic fundamentals.
5:152:11496:18:18:82:547:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The idea that beliefs may be an important independent driver of house price áuctuations
5:153:11583:18:18:64:547:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:often rests on the premise that it is beliefs aboutfuturehouse prices, or expectations, that
5:154:11675:18:18:64:546:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are the key source of variation in home values (e.g., Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2017)). If
5:155:11769:18:18:64:547:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:true, we would expect a shift toward more optimistic beliefs to predict an increase in future
5:156:11862:18:18:64:547:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house price growth and to drive out credit conditions as a competing predictor variable. We
5:157:11953:18:18:64:547:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:therefore ask whether beliefs predict future house price changes, once other fundamentals and
5:158:12046:18:18:64:257:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lagged house prices are controlled for.
5:159:12085:18:0:82:547:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The empirical analyses just described are silent on causality. Thus a Önal hypothesis we
6:160:12174:0:18:64:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investigate is that there is no genuine causality running from credit conditions to house price
6:161:12269:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes, even if there is a positive correlation between the two. Causality might run entirely in
6:162:12366:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the other direction, i.e., from rising home prices to greater credit extension in the boom, and
6:163:12461:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from falling house prices to a constriction of credit during the bust. We address this question by
6:164:12559:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimating a bivariate structural vector autoregression (VAR) in our measure of credit supply
6:165:12652:18:18:64:546:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and house price growth using the shock-restricted identiÖcation approach of Ludvigson, Ma,
6:166:12742:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Ng (2015) and Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng (2016). The approach permits set identiÖcation
6:167:12828:18:18:64:547:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of exogenous variation in the VAR variables under assumptions that are typically weaker than
6:168:12920:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those required for point identiÖcation. If credit conditions have no genuine causal e§ect, then
6:169:13015:18:18:64:546:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shocks to credit conditions that are mutually uncorrelated with house price shocks should not
6:170:13108:18:18:64:547:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have an impact on house prices. We use the shock-restricted structural VAR to address this
6:171:13198:18:17:64:110:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:question.
6:172:13207:17:18:82:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our main Öndings may be summarized as follows. First, changes in credit supply, as mea-
6:173:13294:18:18:64:546:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sured by-CSt;are positively related to the fraction of riskier non-conforming debt in total
6:174:13385:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage lending. The measures of beliefs we study, however, are unrelated to this ratio. This
6:175:13479:18:18:64:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:underscores the role of easier credit in the proliferation of non-conforming debt during the
6:176:13571:18:18:64:364:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:housing boom and its subsequent reversal during the bust.
6:177:13628:18:18:82:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,-CStexplains quantitatively large magnitudes of the variation in quarterly house
6:178:13715:18:18:64:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price growth and is strongly statistically signiÖcant.  For example, it explains 31% of the
6:179:13806:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variation in quarterly house price growth in the full sample from 1991:Q4-2017:Q4, and 54% in
6:180:13899:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the GHC subsample. Several measures of beliefs also have statistically signiÖcant explanatory
6:181:13992:18:18:64:547:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:power for changes in home values, though they explain lower fractions of the variation in house
6:182:14087:18:18:64:546:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price growth compared to changes in credit conditions. Once key macroeconomic fundamentals

6:184:14270:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:statistically signiÖcant explanatory power but only two measures of beliefs do so. These are the
6:185:14366:18:18:64:546:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Soo (2018) national housing media sentiment index, and the growth in the share of households
6:186:14458:18:17:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the SOC who reported being optimistic about the housing market because they said house
6:187:14547:17:18:64:547:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prices would further appreciate. Both of these measures add modestly to the fraction of variation
6:188:14644:18:18:64:322:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explained in contemporaneous house price growth.
6:189:14692:18:18:82:546:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, in terms of predicting future house price changes,-CStis found to be a strong
6:190:14776:18:18:64:547:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal predictor of house price growth, both in terms of statistical signiÖcance and in terms
6:191:14871:18:18:64:547:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of economic magnitudes, over horizons ranging from one- to four-quarters-ahead, controlling for
6:192:14966:18:18:64:546:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic fundamentals, lagged house price growth, and beliefs. We Önd little evidence that be-
6:193:15060:18:18:64:546:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liefs have predictive power for future house price changes, once credit conditions, fundamentals,
6:194:15157:18:18:64:315:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and lagged house price growth are controlled for.
6:195:15206:18:18:82:547:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Fourth, the structural VAR analysis implies that shocks to credit conditions have quantita-
6:196:15297:18:0:64:547:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tively important dynamic causal e§ects on house price changes, with positive shocks (an easing
7:197:15392:0:18:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of credit) increasing home values and negative shocks (a tightening of credit) decreasing them.
7:198:15487:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Although the set identiÖed procedure produces a range of estimates, the bounds of the set are
7:199:15580:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nevertheless informative. They imply that a one-standard deviation shock to-CSincreases
7:200:15667:18:18:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real quarterly house price growth by up to 1.4% on impact, or roughly 5.7% at an annual rate.
7:201:15760:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the lowest end of the range in the set, a one-standard deviation shock to-CSis found to
7:202:15850:18:18:64:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase real quarterly house price growth by roughly 0.8% on impact, or roughly 3.2% at an
7:203:15941:18:18:64:126:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:annual rate.
7:204:15953:18:18:82:547:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the data. Section
7:205:16045:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3 reports the empirical Öndings.  This section includes subsections on the relation between
7:206:16136:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages, credit conditions and beliefs (Section 3.1), on explaining contemporaneous house

7:211:16431:30:18:64:546:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This section describes the data. Details and sources for all data may be found in the Internet
7:212:16525:18:35:64:117:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix.
7:213:16534:35:25:64:290:381:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2.1  Data on Credit Conditions
7:214:16564:25:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our measure of credit conditions is based on the Federal Reserveís SLOOS survey. The survey
7:215:16655:18:18:64:546:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:asks banks to explicitly distinguish between changes in the supply of credit (whether it has
7:216:16747:18:18:64:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:eased or tightened) as distinct from the demand for credit, on bank loans to businesses and
7:217:16838:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:households over the past three months. We focus on questions related tomortgagecredit supply
7:218:16930:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tohouseholds. The detailed information is considered highly reliable because the surveys are
7:219:17022:18:18:64:547:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:carried out by central banks which also function as bank regulators with access to a large
7:220:17112:18:18:64:546:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amount of information about a bankís operations, including those reáected in loan applications
7:221:17206:18:18:64:185:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and balance sheet data.
7:222:17229:18:18:82:547:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For the SLOOS survey, banks indicate easing, tightening, or no change in lending standards
7:223:17319:18:18:64:546:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on purchase mortgages compared to the previous three months. Thus, this variable indicates
7:224:17409:18:18:64:547:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether there has been anychangein lending standards from the previous quarter. We use the
7:225:17499:18:18:64:547:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:net percentage of banks that have eased their lending standards on mortgage loans as a measure
7:226:17593:18:18:64:547:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of credit supply, and denote this variable-CSt. The net percentage is the di§erence between
7:227:17684:18:17:64:546:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the percentage of banks reporting easing and the percentage of banks reporting tightening, thus
7:228:17779:17:18:64:546:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a positive Ögure indicates a net easing of lending standards, considering all bank respondents.
7:229:17874:18:18:64:547:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To facilitate the interpretation of results below, we standardize this variable. These data begin
7:230:17971:18:0:64:123:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in 1990:Q2.
8:231:17983:0:18:82:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 displays the credit supply variable-CStover time. This variable is persistent,
8:232:18070:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with an autoregressive coe¢ cient of 0.9, but statistical tests indicate it is stationary. According
8:233:18170:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to this measure, there was a notable easing of standards from 2002-2006, and a very sharp
8:234:18259:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tightening afterwards. This measure does not weight banks by their relative importance in the
8:235:18352:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage market, nor does it weight the responses by the degree of tightening. Thus, it is not
8:236:18446:18:18:64:546:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an indicator of the strength of credit easing or tightening, only of its breadth. Moreover, until
8:237:18543:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2007, the survey did not distinguish between prime and subprime mortgages. Subsequent to
8:238:18631:18:18:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this time, the SLOOS survey asks banks about lending on di§erent categories of mortgages.
8:239:18720:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Online Appendix explains how we weight these to arrive at the overall index. The Ögure
8:240:18810:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shows a marked broad tightening of credit standards beginning at the end of 2006. A cursory
8:241:18901:18:18:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examination of the Ögure suggests that the easing of standards in the boom was more modest.
8:242:18992:18:17:64:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One must be careful in interpreting this series however. A string of observations starting in 2002
8:243:19090:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and continuing through 2006 show that standards were eased in every quarter. Recall that the
8:244:19182:18:18:64:546:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:survey asks banks about how their standards have changedrelative to the pervious three months.
8:245:19276:18:18:64:546:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Thus a series of observations indicating easier credit conditions relative to previous quarters
8:246:19371:18:18:64:546:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by a few important banks in the mortgage space, once cumulated, could indicate a signiÖcant
8:247:19462:18:18:64:547:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relaxation of underwriting standards. As a crude measure of the magnitude of credit standard
8:248:19554:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:easing or tightening, the bottom panel of Figure 1 reports the Ötted value of-CStover time
8:249:19644:18:18:64:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that would be predicted by the actual changes in GSE-backed conforming loans outstanding
8:250:19732:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and non-conforming ìasset backed securitiesî(ABS) outstanding, categories deÖned explicitly
8:251:19823:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below. This estimate points to a quantitatively large easing of standards from 2002-2006, and
8:252:19916:18:18:64:218:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a sharp tightening afterwards.
8:253:19946:18:18:82:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important aspect of SLOOS survey is that it asks loan o¢ cers to explicitly distinguish
8:254:20036:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between changes in mortgage credit supply as distinct from credit demand (-CD), on bank
8:255:20123:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loans over the past three months. Thus in principle, answers to the appropriate questions are
8:256:20216:18:18:64:546:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able to identify a movement in supply separately from a movement in demand. There could of
8:257:20306:18:17:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:course be some residual correlation between the two. As it turns out, there is very little such
8:258:20401:17:18:64:547:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlation. The results presented in the next sections are not sensitive to replacing-CStwith
8:259:20495:18:18:64:318:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the residual from a regression of-CSton-CDt.
8:260:20539:18:18:82:547:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Itís worth noting that other indicators of credit conditions, even for conforming mortgages,
8:261:20631:18:18:64:546:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also imply that credit standards were signiÖcantly relaxed during the boom and then sub-
8:262:20719:18:18:64:546:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sequently tightened in the bust.  For example, Figure 2 exhibits the fraction, over time, of
8:263:20811:18:18:64:547:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgage originations purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
8:264:20900:18:18:64:546:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with PTI ratios greater than either 35, 45, or 50 percent, weighted by loan balance. The Ög-
8:265:20992:18:18:64:546:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ure shows that PTI ratios increased dramatically from 2000 to the end of 2006. The largest
8:266:21082:18:18:64:546:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase was for the fraction that exceeded 50 percent, which rose by 85% over this period, fol-
8:267:21178:18:0:64:547:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lowed by the fraction that exceeded 45 percent, which rose 66%, and the fraction that exceeded
9:268:21273:0:18:64:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:36 percent, which rose 28%.  All three were sharply reduced in the bust, with the fraction
9:269:21363:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exceeding 50% driven to zero shortly after 2010, in part because of the Dodd-Frank act, which
9:270:21456:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explicitly limits PTI ratios on conforming loans. Because these data are available only annually
9:271:21552:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:since 2000, we donít use them in our empirical analysis below, instead focusing on the SLOOS
9:272:21644:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measure, which is available quarterly and over a longer time frame. But theoretical evidence
9:273:21736:18:18:64:546:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in Greenwald (2017) suggests that time-variation in these PTI constraints have an important
9:274:21827:18:35:64:313:607:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:ináuence on home prices in general equilibrium.3
9:275:21875:35:25:64:209:572:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2.2  Data on Beliefs
9:276:21895:25:18:64:547:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We use four measures of beliefs about home values. The Örst three of these are available from
9:277:21988:18:18:64:546:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the University of Michiganís SOC. The Örst is an index of perceived buying conditions that
9:278:22078:18:18:64:547:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goes back to 1978. The SOC asks, ìGenerally speaking, do you think now is a good time or
9:279:22166:18:18:64:547:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a bad time to buy a house?î We construct a net buying conditions index (BCI) by taking
9:280:22252:18:18:64:546:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the number of ìgoodî answers, subtracting the number of ìbadî answers and adding 100.
9:281:22337:18:18:64:546:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This index is plotted over time in the upper panel of Figure 3. A slightly di§erent measure,
9:282:22429:18:18:64:546:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:thefractionof respondents who answer that now is a ìgood time to buyî is shown in the
9:283:22514:18:18:64:547:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower panel and behaves similarly over time. Below we investigate the relation between the log
9:284:22608:18:18:64:547:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:di§erence in house prices and possible covariates such as beliefs and credit conditions. Thus
9:285:22701:18:17:64:546:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our empirical analysis uses the quarterly log di§erence in all belief indicators, including BCI.
9:286:22797:17:18:64:281:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The log di§erence in BCI is denoted-bci.
9:287:22837:18:18:82:547:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our second measure of beliefs is taken from a follow up question of the SOC on buying
9:288:22922:18:18:64:547:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditions. There may be many reasons respondents answer that it is a good time to buy a
9:289:23010:18:18:64:547:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house. The SOC asks households to give up to two reasons. This is an open-ended question, but
9:290:23103:18:18:64:547:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the SOC groups the answers into six categories. Figure 4 plots the fraction of respondents who
9:291:23197:18:18:64:547:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have a positive view about buying conditions along with the three most important reasons given
9:292:23291:18:18:64:546:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for that view, again in terms of the fraction of respondents who hold that view for that reason.
9:293:23387:18:18:64:547:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As pointed out previously by Piazzesi and Schneider (2009), the most commonly given reason
9:294:23477:18:18:64:546:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that households have a positive view of buying conditions is thatcredit conditions are good.
9:295:23569:18:18:64:546:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Good credit conditions are expressed by referring to low interest rates, lower down payment
9:296:23660:18:18:64:546:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements, or more general ease in obtaining credit.4The next two most important reasons
9:297:23751:18:18:64:546:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:given in the case ofgood time to buyarecurrent prices are low, andfuture prices will be higher.
9:298:23846:18:18:64:547:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Note that relatively few individuals cite an expectation of future price growth as a reason to
9:299:23940:18:15:78:546:134:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3Greenwald (2017) uses the Fannie Mae data to calibrate a general equilibrium model with prepayable debt
9:300:24044:15:12:64:546:119:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and a limit on the ratio of mortgage payments to income. He Önds that a relaxation of payment-to-income
9:301:24147:12:8:64:401:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:standards has large e§ects on home prices and price-rent ratios in the model.
9:302:24224:8:16:78:546:99:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4The SOC refers to this category as ìinterest rates low.î We refer to it as ìgood creditî because the re-
9:303:24329:16:12:64:546:83:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:spondents include all those giving any of the four following reasons for their favorable outlook: 1. Lower down
9:304:24440:12:0:64:478:71:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:payment 2. Interest rates are low 3. Credit easy to get, easy money 4. Variable mortgage rate.
10:305:24535:0:18:64:546:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:buy. Nevertheless, this latter seriesñthe fraction of respondents who say that buying conditions
10:306:24631:18:18:64:546:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are good because future house prices will be highñhones in on the expectations component of
10:307:24722:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beliefs that is central, in some theories, to driving house price variation. In some models, it
10:308:24817:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is crucial that all agents in the economy share the same beliefs (e.g., Kaplan, Mitman, and
10:309:24908:18:18:64:546:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Violante (2017)). But in other models this is not the case. Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) point
10:310:25003:18:18:64:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out that in a search market with high transaction costs, even a small number of optimistic
10:311:25093:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(pessimistic) buyers can drive up (down) the average transaction price without a large increase
10:312:25188:18:18:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in trading volume. This insight motivates us to use the fraction of respondents who say that
10:313:25280:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:buying conditions are good because future house prices will be high as a third measure of house
10:314:25375:18:18:64:546:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price beliefs. Our empirical analysis uses the log di§erence in this fraction, denoted-bcihighFPt.
10:315:25473:18:18:64:531:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This measure is available over the same time period as the overall buying conditions index.
10:316:25564:18:17:82:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The third measure available from the SOC asks households for a point forecast on house
10:317:25650:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price changes over the next 12 months. This measures is available from 2007:Q1 onward. This
10:318:25741:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:question asks respondentsBy about what percent do you expect prices of homes like yours in
10:319:25831:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:your community to go (up/down), on average, over the next 12 months?The SOC asks the
10:320:25915:18:18:64:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analogous question for expected ináation over the next 12 months. We use either the median
10:321:26005:18:18:64:546:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or mean responses to both questions to construct a measure of real house price expectations
10:322:26096:18:29:64:358:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(-pet). For example, the median response is calculated as
10:323:26153:29:30:208:403:381:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:-pe;medt=Emedt- logPt+4-Emedt-t+4;
10:324:26187:30:18:64:547:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where ìEmedtîdenotes the median value of the survey expectation for house prices and ináation.
10:325:26281:18:18:64:547:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The mean response for house price growth is constructed in an analogous fashion and denoted
10:326:26372:18:18:64:103:315:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:-pe;avgt.
10:327:26381:18:18:82:547:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our fourth measure of beliefs is the national version of Sooís (Soo (2018)) housing media
10:328:26470:18:17:64:547:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sentiment index.  Soo measures housing sentiment through a textual analysis of content in
10:329:26559:17:18:64:547:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:newspaper articles from major publications in 34 cities of the U.S. spanning the period January
10:330:26654:18:18:64:547:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000 to December 2013. Soo calculates sentiment by subtracting the number of negative words
10:331:26745:18:18:64:546:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about housing from the number of positive words and dividing by the total number of words,
10:332:26835:18:18:64:546:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:where ìnegativeîand ìpositiveîrefer to sentiment about current and future home values. Thus
10:333:26926:18:18:64:546:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this index rises when media housing sentiment is more ìbullishîand falls when media sentiment
10:334:27019:18:18:64:547:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:turns more ìbearish.î Soo further shows that log changes in her index at the city level have
10:335:27111:18:18:64:547:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important predictive power for house price changes in the corresponding city. Here we employ
10:336:27203:18:18:64:546:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:log changes in the national version of her housing media index in our empirical analysis of

10:338:27346:18:18:82:547:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each of these four measures of beliefs are constructed so that anincreasein the measure

11:342:27704:18:35:64:372:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures should be positively related to home price growth.

11:345:27876:18:18:64:547:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price áuctuations at the aggregate level. The Örst is the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home
11:346:27969:18:18:64:547:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Price Index (CSUS) and the second is the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) home price
11:347:28058:18:18:64:547:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:index. These series are divided by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and plotted over time in
11:348:28148:18:18:64:547:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 5. The lower panel plots the same series relative to an aggregate measure of rents, a

11:350:28329:18:18:64:547:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dramatic boom/bust cycle is clear in the Ögure for both series, but is much more pronounced
11:351:28420:18:18:64:547:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the CSUS than in the FHFA. The most signiÖcant di§erence between the two indexes is
11:352:28506:18:18:64:547:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that FHFA collects data from mortgages that have been purchased or securitized by Fannie
11:353:28594:18:18:64:546:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) only. (It also equal-weights
11:354:28680:18:18:64:546:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house prices and includes reÖnances, while the CSUS does not.)  The CSUS index includes
11:355:28767:18:18:64:547:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all available transactions on single-family homes, including sales Önanced with non-conforming
11:356:28861:18:18:64:546:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortgages, such as jumbo, Alt-A and subprime. As a result, this index is broader than FHFA.
11:357:28952:18:18:64:546:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Transactions are also value-weighted in the CSUS. Because of its breadth, and because non-
11:358:29042:18:17:64:547:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conforming mortgage lending appears to have played an outsized role in the GHC, we use the
11:359:29132:17:18:64:547:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:CSUS index as our main measure of national home prices in the empirical work below. We

11:361:29308:18:36:64:186:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variable is denoted-pt.
11:362:29331:36:30:64:222:296:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3  Empirical Findings
11:363:29352:30:18:64:546:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This section reports the empirical Öndings. Output for all regressions include the coe¢ cient
11:364:29445:18:18:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates, adjustedR2statistic, and heteroskedasticity and serial correlation robust (HAC)t-
11:365:29537:18:18:64:547:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:statistics (Newey and West (1987)). To assess potential Önite sample biases, for each regression
11:366:29633:18:18:64:547:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we also undertake bootstrap procedures under the null that the explanatory variables have
11:367:29722:18:18:64:547:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no marginal explanatory power.  Following the prescription of Horowitz (2003), we use the
11:368:29811:18:18:64:547:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bootstrap to estimate the probability distribution of thet-statistic for each coe¢ cient under
11:369:29905:18:18:64:547:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this null, since such a statistic is asymptotically pivotal and can deliver bias reduction in Önite
11:370:30004:18:18:64:546:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:samples. To account for the serial dependence of the data, we use two approaches. The Örst
11:371:30094:18:17:64:547:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employs a parametric model of the serial dependence, while the second is a non-parametric
11:372:30183:17:18:64:547:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model based on block bootstraps.  We refer to these as the parametric and nonparametric
11:373:30270:18:18:64:547:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bootstrap, respectively. Each regression table reports statistical signiÖcance on the basis of the
11:374:30368:18:0:64:546:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two bootstrap distributions of thet-statistic, as well as the Newey-West HAC approximation
12:375:30459:0:18:64:308:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the asymptotic distribution of thet-statistic.
12:376:30508:18:18:82:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The samples used in each empirical analysis depend on data availability. Di§erent measures
12:377:30598:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of beliefs are available over di§erent time periods. In addition, although the SLOOS survey
12:378:30689:18:18:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:begins in 1990:Q2, our measure of the real 10-year Treasury bond, used in several regressions,
12:379:30783:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uses the Survey of Professional Forecasters median 10-year ináation forecast to construct a
12:380:30874:18:18:64:549:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:real rate. This latter variable is available starting in 1991:Q4. Thus our longest ìfull sampleî
12:381:30970:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spans the period 1991:Q4-2017:Q4. We begin by investigating mortgage credit extension and
12:382:31059:18:34:64:336:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its relation to credit conditions and beliefs over time.
12:383:31115:34:26:64:399:555:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3.1  Mortgages, Credit Conditions, and Beliefs
12:384:31161:26:18:64:547:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Mortgages vary in terms of the attributes that are considered to be closely related to the ex-ante
12:385:31259:18:18:64:547:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:riskiness of the loan. For the purposes of this paper, we shall deÖne aconformingloan to be
12:386:31350:18:18:64:547:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one that is eligible for purchase by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae
12:387:31441:18:18:64:547:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Freddie Mac. Conforming loans are considered less risky than non-conforming loans for
12:388:31530:18:18:64:547:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two reasons. First, they must adhere to strict eligibility requirements that ostensibly limit the
12:389:31627:18:18:64:546:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:riskiness of the loan ex-ante. These include limits on the size of the loan, on the borrowerís
12:390:31721:18:18:64:547:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:LTV ratio, on the borrowerís PTI ratio, on the borrowerís credit score, and the documentation
12:391:31814:18:18:64:547:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements of the loan.5Second, the GSEs purchase these safer mortgages on the secondary
12:392:31904:18:17:64:547:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market and guarantee them against default.Non-conforming loans, such as jumbo, subprime,
12:393:31992:17:18:64:547:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Alt-A mortgages, are considered riskier than conforming loans, since they need not adhere
12:394:32085:18:18:64:490:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to these standards and they are ineligible for purchase and guarantee by the GSEs.
12:395:32167:18:18:82:547:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Time variation in the composition of loans over time is of interest because of how it relates to
12:396:32263:18:18:64:547:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lending standards, holding Öxed aggregate credit demand. When loan o¢ cers at banks answer
12:397:32353:18:18:64:547:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:questions on whether their lending standards have eased or tightened, their answers presumably
12:398:32447:18:18:64:547:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relate to the price terms of the mortgage contracts, such as interest rates, but also non-price
12:399:32542:18:18:64:547:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terms such as the maximum loan-to-value ratio, the maximum payment-to-income ratio, any
12:400:32629:18:18:64:546:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements on private mortgage insurance, and the minimum credit score. If so, it is natural
12:401:32723:18:18:64:547:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to expect a reportedeasingof bank lending standards to be associated with an increase in
12:402:32811:18:18:64:547:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the share of credit extended to borrowers who do not meet the eligibility requirements of a
12:403:32902:18:18:64:546:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conforming loan, and conversely for a reported tightening of standards. By contrast, there is
12:404:32995:18:18:64:547:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no reason to expect an economy-wide change in demand for mortgages to be related to the
12:405:33082:18:18:64:547:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:composition of loans, since presumably the demand for all types of credit would change in
12:406:33171:18:18:64:155:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rough proportion.
12:407:33188:18:17:82:547:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The upper panel of Figure 6 shows theshareof mortgages outstanding by mortgage type,

13:413:33682:18:18:64:546:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conforming loans. The ABS mortgages are the sum of jumbo, subprime, and Alt-A mortgages
13:414:33769:18:18:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discussed above. The Ögure shows a signiÖcant change in the composition of loans from 2002-
13:415:33860:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2007: a sharp rise in the share of ABS during the housing boom, which mirrors a sharp fall in the
13:416:33957:18:18:64:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of GSE loans. From 2000 to 2006, the share of ABS in total mortgages outstanding almost
13:417:34050:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tripled, increasing 178%. This indicates a shift in the composition of mortgage lending, away
13:418:34143:18:18:64:547:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from conforming debt and toward non-conforming debt, a trend that was subsequently reversed
13:419:34234:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:after 2007 during the housing bust. The lower panel of Figure 6 shows a similar pattern in the
13:420:34328:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:share of mortgageoriginationsover time, which comes from a di§erent data source comprised of
13:421:34420:18:18:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:annual rather than quarterly observations. The analogy to the ABS category in the originations
13:422:34514:18:17:64:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data is the ìprivate labelîPL+Portfolio category. Private label includes mortgages securitized
13:423:34608:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by private institutions. Portfolio includes mortgages held in the asset portfolios of life insurance
13:424:34708:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and a¢ liate institutions.  The sum of these two
13:425:34797:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:categories is comprised entirely of non-conforming debt, since the conforming loans are all sold
13:426:34893:18:18:64:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:o§ to the GSEs and counted as part of the GSE category. Again we see a signiÖcant change in
13:427:34984:18:18:64:547:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the composition of originations over the boom period, with a sharp rise in the non-conforming
13:428:35077:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:PL loans relative to total originations, and a sharp reversal of this trend over the housing
13:429:35169:18:18:64:546:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bust. Over the boom period 2000-2006, the share of PL+Portfolios loans in total originations
13:430:35261:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increased by roughly 40%, but because the share falls in the intermediate aftermath of the
13:431:35351:18:18:64:340:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2000-2001 recession, it increased 63% from 2001-2006.
13:432:35404:18:18:82:547:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Örst column of Table 1 shows that the short-term trends in-CSare related to these
13:433:35489:18:18:64:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:changes in the composition of lending. For the quarterly data on mortgages outstanding, we
13:434:35579:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investigate the relation between the year-over-year growth in credit standards, measured as the
13:435:35674:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:four-quarter sum of the SLOOS net percentage easing indicator-CSshown in Figure 1, and
13:436:35760:18:18:64:546:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:year-over-year growth in mortgage credit outstanding, by mortgage type. The table reports
13:437:35849:18:17:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results from a regression of the latter on the former. Changes in credit standards-CSare
13:438:35937:17:18:64:547:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positively related to growth in ABS and negatively related to growth in mortgages held in GSE
13:439:36030:18:18:64:547:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pools. The last column shows the results from a regression on the growth in theratioof ABS

13:441:36211:18:18:64:546:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reporting an easing of credit standards is associated with a shift in the composition of loans,
13:442:36306:18:18:64:547:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:toward non-conforming loans and away from conforming loans. This result is more pronounced
13:443:36396:18:18:64:546:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when looking only at the entire GHC period 2000-2010 (Panel B), underscoring the role of
13:444:36484:18:18:64:546:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:easier credit standards in the proliferation of non-conforming debt during the housing boom.

13:449:36735:18:0:82:547:69:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In contrast to changes in creditsupply, there is little reason to expect a belief-driven change

14:451:36919:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presumably demand for all types of loans would change in rough proportion. Columns two
14:452:37005:18:18:64:546:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through six in Table 1 show the relationship between the four beliefs measures and the com-
14:453:37096:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:position of mortgage credit outstanding. We regress the year-over-year growth in mortgage
14:454:37185:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit outstanding, by mortgage type, on the year-over-year log change in beliefs. Using these
14:455:37279:18:18:64:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures, there is little evidence that shifts in the composition of mortgages toward riskier

14:460:37730:18:18:64:547:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should be positive if optimistic beliefs were a source of growth in the ratio of non-conforming to

14:471:38739:18:18:64:547:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B is not supportive of this hypothesis. It is worth pointing out, however, that while shifts in the
14:472:38838:18:18:64:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:composition of mortgage credit are not associated with these measures of beliefs about house

15:498:41064:18:18:82:547:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 3 presents the results of the univariate regressions, where Panel A gives results over
15:499:41156:18:18:64:546:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the full sample that is available given the data series being used, and Panel B presents results
15:500:41252:18:18:64:547:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the GHC subsample. Panel A shows that, in the sample from 1991:Q4-2017:Q4, changes in

15:504:41618:18:17:64:547:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a one standard deviation increase around its mean. Thus a coe¢ cient of 0.01 implies that a

15:506:41802:18:18:64:546:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price growth, or roughly a 4% rise at an annual rate. This increase represents about one-half
15:507:41895:18:18:64:498:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of a one-standard deviation change in quarterly U.S. real house price growth (1.9%).
15:508:41979:18:18:82:547:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Of the two measures of beliefs that are available over the same sample period, the overall

15:519:42986:18:17:64:546:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outliers than the median, the Önding that the average point forecast explains a larger fraction of
15:520:43084:17:18:64:546:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house price growth than the median forecast lends empirical support for the model in Piazzesi
15:521:43177:18:0:64:547:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and Schneider (2009), which implies that a small number of optimists (or pessimists) can have
16:522:43272:0:18:64:512:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an important e§ect on the relatively few repeat sales transactions observed in the data.
16:523:43360:18:18:82:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the GHC subsample (Panel B),-CStexplains a much larger fraction (54%) of the
16:524:43439:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variation in-ptthan in the full sample, reinforcing the notion that credit conditions played an
16:525:43534:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out-sized role in the housing boom and bust. Of the three beliefs measures that are available over
16:526:43632:18:18:64:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this subsample, only the housing media index-hmitis statistically related to-pt, explaining

16:528:43810:18:18:64:546:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and unlike the full sample, growth in the share of optimistic households who said housing was

16:530:43997:18:18:64:546:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to house price growth in the GHC subsample. Thus, while the univariate regressions suggest
16:531:44087:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that both credit conditions and beliefs are contemporaneously related to current house price
16:532:44179:18:18:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth, the credit conditions measure is found to explain much larger fractions than the beliefs
16:533:44275:18:17:64:276:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measures of the variation in home values.
16:534:44316:17:18:82:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In most economic theories, both credit standards and beliefs evolve endogenously with the
16:535:44405:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:state of the economy and with expectations about future economic conditions. This is so even
16:536:44497:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in fully rational models where beliefs have no independent role to play. Thus an important
16:537:44587:18:18:64:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:question for the literature on behavioral biases is whether beliefs pushed house prices beyond
16:538:44681:18:18:64:547:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what would be justiÖed by economic fundamentals alone, in which case beliefs should contain
16:539:44772:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information about house price growth that is independent of that in measures of economic
16:540:44860:18:18:64:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamentals. Moreover, if beliefs but not credit standards are the driving force behind house
16:541:44954:18:18:64:423:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:price changes, the former should drive the latter out of the regression.

17:586:48438:26:18:64:547:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The idea that beliefs may be an important independent driver of house price áuctuations often
17:587:48531:18:18:64:546:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rests on the premise that it is beliefs aboutfuturehouse prices, or expectations, that are the
17:588:48625:18:18:64:547:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:key source of variation in home values. If true, we would expect a shift toward more optimistic
17:589:48720:18:18:64:546:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beliefs to predict an increase in future house price growth. We now ask which measures, if any,
17:590:48815:18:18:64:546:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:help predict future house price growth, controlling for credit conditions and fundamentals. It is
17:591:48912:18:18:64:546:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also of interest to ask whether credit conditions themselves predict home prices. In the model
17:592:49006:18:18:64:547:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2017), credit conditions are predicted to have no forecasting
17:593:49100:18:18:64:546:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:power for house price growth once beliefs are controlled for, so the former should be driven out

18:599:49587:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth is correlated with its own lags, thus we also include timethouse price growth-ptas

18:607:50264:18:18:64:546:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamentals explains 26% of one-quarter-ahead house price growth, while adding lagged prices
18:608:50357:18:18:64:547:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases this value to 32%. In the sample for which the housing sentiment index is available

18:615:50982:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quarter-ahead house price growth, while adding lagged prices decreases this to 29%. These
18:616:51071:18:18:64:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results underscore the strong predictive power of credit conditions for aggregate home price
18:617:51163:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:áuctuations, especially in the GHC subsample.  A caveat with the shorter GHC subsample
18:618:51249:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results is that the coe¢ cient on-CSt, while signiÖcantly di§erent from zero according to the
18:619:51342:18:18:64:546:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:HAC distribution of thet-statistic, is not signiÖcant according to the bootrapped distributions.
18:620:51438:18:18:82:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is worth noting that in each of the preceding results, the one-quarter-ahead forecasting
18:621:51529:18:0:64:487:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:regression using-CStas thesolepredictor variable produces e§ectively the sameR

18:624:51620:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater) as does a regression using both-CStand fundamentals as predictor variables. The
18:625:51708:18:18:64:546:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reason is the same as that given above for the contemporaneous regressions: credit standards
18:626:51800:18:17:64:547:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contain information that subsumes the information in the real ten-year bond yield and expected
18:627:51894:17:18:64:547:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic growth, so that eliminating either or both of the latter has little e§ect on the fraction
18:628:51992:18:18:64:327:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of variation explained in future house price growth.
18:629:52044:18:18:82:547:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second take-away from Tables 5, 6 and 7 is that there is no evidence that beliefs have
18:630:52132:18:18:64:547:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important predictive power for future house prices, once credit conditions, fundamentals and
18:631:52224:18:18:64:547:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lagged house price growth are controlled for. The single speciÖcation for which a belief measure
18:632:52320:18:18:64:547:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is marginally signiÖcant is exhibited in Table 5 for the sample 1991:Q4-2017:Q4 where the

18:635:52587:18:18:64:547:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:comparison with the top panel of the same table shows that this measure adds little to the

19:641:52950:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Table 6). We also Önd that eliminating lagged house price growth as an additional predictor
19:642:53042:18:35:64:373:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has little ináuence on the predictability results using beliefs.

19:644:53161:25:18:64:547:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this section we consider a Önal hypothesis, namely that there was no genuine causality
19:645:53250:18:18:64:547:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:running from credit conditions to house price changes, despite the positive correlation between
19:646:53345:18:18:64:547:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the two. Instead, the causality ran entirely in the other direction, i.e., from rising home prices to
19:647:53446:18:18:64:546:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater credit extension in the boom, and conversely from falling house prices to a constriction of
19:648:53545:18:18:64:546:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:credit during the bust. This reverse causality story is often associated with models where beliefs
19:649:53643:18:18:64:546:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:play an important role. For example, exuberant expectations about future house prices might
19:650:53734:18:18:64:546:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have been the singular driving force behind rising house prices and relaxed credit conditions. If
19:651:53831:18:18:64:547:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:so, shocks to credit conditions that are mutually uncorrelated with house price shocks should
19:652:53924:18:18:64:249:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not have an impact on house prices.
19:653:53959:18:18:82:547:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To address this question we identify exogenous variation in our measure of credit conditions,
19:654:54052:18:18:64:547:421:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:-CSt, and relate it to home price growth-ptusing a structural VAR (SVAR). To identify
19:655:54137:18:18:64:547:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exogenous variation, we employ theshock-restrictedSVAR approach of Ludvigson, Ma, and
19:656:54222:18:17:64:546:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Ng (2015) and Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng (2016) that permits set identiÖcation of the structural
19:657:54313:17:18:64:546:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shocks under assumptions that are typically weaker than those required for point identiÖcation.
19:658:54408:18:18:64:547:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Here we provide only a brief description of the identiÖcation strategy and refer the reader to
19:659:54502:18:18:64:186:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those papers for details.
19:660:54527:18:18:82:547:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The structural shocks of interest are the mutually uncorrelated innovations in the SVAR

19:663:54787:18:18:64:547:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion we make is that changes in the composition of mortgages, i.e., toward non-conforming
19:664:54876:18:18:64:546:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loans and away from conforming loans, should be informative about credit standard shocks.
19:665:54965:18:18:64:546:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This is implemented by requiring that a positive credit standard structural shock (i.e., an eas-
19:666:55061:18:18:64:547:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing of standards) must exhibit a minimum (lower bound) correlation with the quarterly log

19:668:55240:18:18:64:547:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ashock-based external variable constraint, where the parameter-sets the lower bound of the
19:669:55330:18:18:64:547:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlation. Although this approach has the áavor of an external instrumental variable (IV) or

19:671:55524:16:12:64:546:118:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:paradigms, even those for which belief shocks play no role but exogenous movements in credit conditions have
19:672:55632:12:12:64:546:106:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:quantitatively important causal consquences for house prices (e.g., Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh
19:673:55742:12:12:64:546:94:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2017)), would imply this reverse causality. This is because credit conditions themeselves also have an endoge-

20:677:56126:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unlike the external IV approach, the external variable in this methodology isnotassumed to be
20:678:56219:18:18:64:546:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exogenous (uncorrelated with house price shocks) as would be required of a valid IV. Instead,
20:679:56312:18:18:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we only require the weaker assumption that the composition of mortgages is relevant for credit
20:680:56406:18:18:64:546:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards. It is because these restrictions are weaker that we do not achieve point identiÖca-
20:681:56500:18:18:64:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion. The bounds of the identiÖed set may still be informative, however, a possibility we now
20:682:56593:18:18:64:122:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investigate.
20:683:56605:18:18:82:547:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We use impulse response functions to understand the dynamic causal e§ects and propagating
20:684:56694:18:18:64:546:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanisms of a credit standards shock. Figure 7 shows, in shaded areas, the identiÖed set of
20:685:56787:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dynamic responses of quarterly real house price growth (in percent) to a one standard deviation

20:687:56974:18:17:64:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure shows the results for two values of the lower bound on the correlation constraint between

20:689:57152:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards shocks are required to have a correlation with-ln(ABSt=GSEt)of at least 7%, while
20:690:57243:18:18:64:355:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the bottom panel this requirement is slackened to 5%.
20:691:57299:18:18:82:547:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given that we have a set of solutions, the impulse responses present a range of estimated
20:692:57388:18:18:64:546:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:magnitudes of the e§ect of credit standard shocks on house price growth. But the bounds of
20:693:57478:18:18:64:546:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the set are su¢ ciently tight that they are still informative about the dynamic relationship of
20:694:57573:18:18:64:547:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interest. At the highest end of the range, the results for-= 0:07indicate that a one-standard
20:695:57666:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deviation shock to-CSincreases real quarterly house price growth by 1.4% on impact, or
20:696:57752:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:roughly 5.7% at an annual rate. At the lowest end of the range, a one-standard deviation shock
20:697:57846:18:18:64:547:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to-CSincreases real quarterly house price growth by roughly 0.8% on impact, or roughly
20:698:57932:18:18:64:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.2% at an annual rate. These results are not highly sensitive to the value of-, though the sets
20:699:58028:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are invariably wider when the identifying restriction is slackened. In the bottom panel, which
20:700:58122:18:18:64:547:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shows the results for-=  0:05, the high end of the range is roughly the same as in the top
20:701:58212:18:18:64:547:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:panel, but the low end is lower than in the top panel. In this case, the low end shows that a
20:702:58305:18:17:64:546:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one-standard deviation shock to-CSincreases real quarterly house price growth by roughly
20:703:58393:17:18:64:546:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:0.6% on impact, or roughly 2.4% at an annual rate. Though these magnitudes are substantial
20:704:58483:18:18:64:546:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and well determined, the estimated persistence of the e§ects is less well determined. At least
20:705:58577:18:18:64:547:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some solutions in the identiÖed set imply that the e§ects die out after 3 quarters, while others
20:706:58673:18:36:64:254:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggest much more persistent e§ects.
20:707:58709:36:30:64:166:141:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Conclusion
20:708:58722:30:18:64:547:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We consider two potential driving forces of house price áuctuations, credit conditions and
20:709:58812:18:18:64:547:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beliefs, using direct measures of these variables.  To measure credit conditions, we use the
20:710:58904:18:0:64:547:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Senior Loan O¢ cer Opinion Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve, which asks senior loan
21:711:58996:0:18:64:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:o¢ cers at banks to state whether their lending standards for purchase mortgages have eased
21:712:59087:18:18:64:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or tightened relative to the previous quarter.  To measure beliefs, we study three separate
21:713:59178:18:18:64:546:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:household-level survey measures from the University of Michiganís Survey of Consumers that
21:714:59268:18:18:64:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ask speciÖcally about the respondentís view on home prices and a fourth measure based on
21:715:59356:18:18:64:546:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the index constructed by Soo (2018) that measures sentiment about housing using a textual
21:716:59445:18:18:64:546:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analysis of major news publications. We combine these data with data on national house prices
21:717:59538:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in order to compile a set of statistical facts on the empirical relationships among these variables
21:718:59637:18:18:64:177:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at the aggregate level.
21:719:59660:18:18:82:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We Önd that a relaxation of credit standards is positively related to the fraction of riskier
21:720:59753:18:18:64:547:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-conforming debt in total mortgage lending, while beliefs bear little empirical relation to
21:721:59847:18:18:64:546:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this fraction. Credit conditions have statistically signiÖcant and economically important ex-
21:722:59940:18:17:64:547:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:planatory power for contemporaneous house price changes as well as predictive power for future
21:723:60034:17:18:64:547:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house price changes, even after lagged house price changes and economic fundamentals such
21:724:60123:18:18:64:547:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as interest rates and expected economic growth are controlled for. Two measures of beliefs
21:725:60213:18:18:64:547:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have statistically signiÖcant explanatory power for contemporaneous house price changes once
21:726:60305:18:18:64:546:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamentals are controlled for, though these measures explain substantially smaller fractions
21:727:60399:18:18:64:546:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the variation in house price growth than do credit standards. These are the Soo national
21:728:60490:18:18:64:547:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:housing media sentiment index, and the growth in the share of households in the SOC who
21:729:60577:18:18:64:546:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reported being optimistic about the housing market because they said house prices would fur-
21:730:60669:18:18:64:547:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ther appreciate. We Önd little evidence that beliefs have importantpredictivepower for future
21:731:60762:18:18:64:547:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:house price changes, once credit conditions, fundamentals and lagged house price growth are
21:732:60853:18:18:64:546:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:controlled for. A structural VAR analysis implies that shocks to credit conditions have quan-
21:733:60946:18:18:64:547:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:titatively large dynamic causal e§ects on house price changes, especially in the short-run, with
21:734:61042:18:18:64:547:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positive shocks (an easing of credit) driving up home values and negative shocks driving them

38:1260:83115:26:31:64:237:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This appendix discusses the data.
38:1261:83148:31:25:64:165:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Credit Standards
38:1262:83164:25:18:64:546:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Senior Loan O¢ cer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) provides qual-
38:1263:83250:18:18:64:547:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:itative and limited quantitative information on bank credit availability and loan demand, as
38:1264:83342:18:18:64:547:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well as on evolving developments and lending practices in the U.S. loan markets. The FED
38:1265:83430:18:18:64:547:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requires one or more senior loan o¢ cers at each respondent bank to complete the survey, up to
38:1266:83524:18:18:64:547:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:six times a year; however, the survey has typically been conducted only four times a year since
38:1267:83619:18:18:64:546:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1992. The current reporting panel consists of up to 80 large domestically chartered commercial
38:1268:83713:18:18:64:547:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks and up to 24 large U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The minimum asset size
38:1269:83805:18:18:64:546:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for panel institutions is $2 billions (this amount was reduced in 2012 from $3 billion). As of
38:1270:83899:18:18:64:546:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:March 31, 2017, the panel of domestic respondents contained 80 banks, 47 of which had assets
38:1271:83991:18:18:64:547:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of $20 billion or more. The assets of the panel banks totaled $11.8 trillion and accounted for
38:1272:84085:18:18:64:542:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about 69 percent of the $17.0 trillion in total assets of all domestically chartered institutions.
38:1273:84183:18:18:82:547:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The FED seeks to limit the di¢ culty and quantitative content of survey questions. When
38:1274:84270:18:18:64:547:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quantitative information is requested, respondents generally are asked to provide approximate
38:1275:84363:18:18:64:546:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or rough estimates, usually in terms of percentages rather than dollar amounts. A respondent
38:1276:84455:18:17:64:547:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may decline to answer a particular question when answering would entail excessive burden. The
38:1277:84548:17:18:64:547:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FED distributes two versions of the survey, one to domestically chartered institutions and one
38:1278:84642:18:18:64:306:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.
38:1279:84689:18:18:82:547:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since 2012, the FED maintains a panel of 80 banks (from 1981 to 2012, the FED maintained
38:1280:84777:18:18:64:546:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a panel of 60 insured, domestically chartered commercial banks, before 1981 they were 120).
38:1281:84868:18:18:64:546:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To ensure adequate geographic coverage, the survey panel of domestic banks spans all Federal
38:1282:84960:18:18:64:546:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Reserve Districts, while balancing the need to keep it heavily weighted toward the largest banks.
38:1283:85057:18:18:64:547:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, the panel also includes a fair number of large and medium-size regional banks, which
38:1284:85150:18:18:64:544:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allows for a greater diversity of responses and provides a broader view of the banking system.
38:1285:85244:18:18:82:547:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In selecting the panel, the Fed generally imposes three constraints: (i)size: banks that
38:1286:85332:18:18:64:547:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have less than $2 billion of total assets or for which commercial and industrial (C&I) loans
38:1287:85424:18:18:64:546:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are less than 5 % of total assets are eliminated from consideration, with a few exceptions,
38:1288:85515:18:18:64:546:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(ii)geographic diversity: between two and ten banks are included from each district, (iii)
38:1289:85605:18:18:64:547:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:mutual independence: with some exceptions, a bank is eliminated from consideration if it
38:1290:85693:18:18:64:547:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is a subsidiary of a bank holding company that is already represented in the panel, because
38:1291:85784:18:17:64:547:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its responses would likely not be independent of those of the related bank already providing
38:1292:85876:17:0:64:115:65:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:responses.
39:1293:85887:0:18:82:547:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The Fed tries to maintain a panel of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. As of
39:1294:85974:18:18:64:546:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:March 2017, the panel included 23 institutions, 21 of which are located in the New York District.
39:1295:86071:18:18:64:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In March 2017, the share of C&I loans held by respondent U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
39:1296:86165:18:18:64:546:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks ($187.7 billion) relative to that held by the universe of such institutions ($274.8 billion)
39:1297:86263:18:18:64:111:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:was 68%.
39:1298:86271:18:18:82:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As of April 2007, the SLOOS asked one question about supply of residential mortgages and
39:1299:86359:18:18:64:547:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one about demand. From April 2007 until January 2015, it divided the supply and demand
39:1300:86445:18:18:64:546:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:questions in three categories of residential mortgage loans: (i) prime residential mortgages, (ii)
39:1301:86543:18:18:64:547:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nontraditional residential mortgages, and (iii) subprime residential mortgages. As stated by

40:1354:89926:18:18:64:547:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To construct this measure from the respondentsíinformation, Örst sum all the banks that have

41:1373:90931:18:18:64:547:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:three di§erent categories for the net percentage of domestic respondents easing standards for

42:1411:93552:18:18:94:547:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:used to document the type and extent of the missing information to the questions on

42:1413:93721:18:18:94:547:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:it reáects a respondentís refusal to answer the question. This type of missing data is
42:1414:93807:18:18:94:547:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relatively uncommon. Second,DK IFsigniÖes that in response to the Örst question on
42:1415:93889:18:18:94:547:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the expected direction of change in prices, the respondent replied that they did not know
42:1416:93978:18:18:94:547:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether prices would increase or decrease. This response reáects the respondentís lack
42:1417:94064:18:18:94:547:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of knowledge or understanding, and hence lacks any information content. This type of
42:1418:94148:18:17:94:546:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:missing data has also been relatively uncommon. Third,DK UP - DK DWsignify
42:1419:94222:17:18:94:547:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that only partial information was obtained. The respondents indicated the direction they

42:1423:94486:18:18:94:547:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:excluding these cases, the implicit assumption is that the overall sample mean or median
42:1424:94574:18:18:94:336:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is the best estimate of the missing information.

43:1427:94754:18:18:94:547:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:about the direction of expected change in prices (but not the extent of expected change).
43:1428:94843:18:18:94:547:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The usual procedure is to impute the mean/median increase or decrease calculated among
43:1429:94929:18:18:94:547:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the complete data cases. Rather than imputing apoint estimateof the mean or median, a
43:1430:95014:18:18:94:547:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution of responses is imputed whose mean/median is identical to the point estimate.
43:1431:95104:18:18:94:547:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This is done by distributing the DK UP and DK DW cases across all response codes in

48:1608:106304:26:18:64:547:689:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This appendix describes our bootstrap procedure. We employ two approaches that we refer to as
48:1609:106397:18:18:64:547:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the parametric and non-parametric bootstrap. The distinction refers to how serial dependence
48:1610:106489:18:18:64:547:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is modeled. In the Örst approach, serial dependence is speciÖed using a parametric model. In
48:1611:106581:18:18:64:546:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the second approach, it is speciÖed using a block bootstrap procedure. For both approaches,
48:1612:106672:18:30:64:335:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the general linear model we consider is the following:
48:1613:106726:30:29:256:547:587:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:yt=\f0+\f\f\f0xxxt+-yt(A1)

48:1615:106854:18:18:64:547:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be multidimensional. We are interested in the distribution of thet-statistic for each element

51:1835:109687:26:18:64:547:689:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This procedure uses block bootstrap sampling to capture serial dependence in the data. We
51:1836:109776:18:18:64:547:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose the block length following the recommendation of Hall, Horowitz, and Jing (1995) who
