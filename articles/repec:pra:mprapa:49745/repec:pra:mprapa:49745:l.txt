2:26:1494:34:33:90:203:390:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:1  Introduction
2:27:1509:33:22:90:522:357:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Stochastic dominance (SD) theory has been well established, see, for example, Hanoch and
2:28:1597:22:22:90:522:335:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Levy (1969), Hadar and Russell (1969), and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970). Leshno and
2:29:1682:22:22:90:522:313:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Levy (2002) extend it to the theory of almost stochastic dominance (ASD) formostdecision
2:30:1770:22:22:90:522:291:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:makers. ASD has been widely used in many areas, especially in finance, see, for example,
2:31:1858:22:22:90:384:269:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Levy (2006, 2009), Bali, et al. (2009), and Levy, et al. (2010).
2:32:1922:22:22:106:521:247:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:A:Recently, Guo, et al. (2013) find that when comparing any two prospects, there will be
2:33:2008:22:22:90:522:225:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:ASD relationship even there is only very little difference in mean, variance, skewness, or
2:34:2098:22:21:90:522:203:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:kurtosis. Investors may prefer to conclude ASD only if the dominance is nearly almost.
2:35:2184:21:22:90:522:182:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Levy, et al. (2010) have provided two approaches to solve the problem. In this paper, we
2:36:2272:22:22:90:522:160:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:extend their work by first recommending an existing stochastic dominance test to handle
2:37:2359:22:22:90:522:138:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:the issue and thereafter developing a new test for the ASD which could detect dominance
2:38:2446:22:22:90:522:116:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:for any pre-determined small value. We also provide two approaches to obtain the critical
2:39:2535:22:0:90:226:94:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:values for our proposed test.

4:129:4144:32:22:106:521:726:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:A:From Definition 1, we can see clearly that the proportions of the nagging negative areas

4:147:4788:22:22:90:521:473:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:advantage of usingε0-ASD– the modification of ASD – in Definition 1 is that when one

4:152:5192:48:33:89:197:337:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:3  The Theory
4:153:5205:33:22:90:522:304:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Recently, Guo, et al. (2013) find that when comparing any two prospects, there will be ASD
4:154:5295:22:22:90:522:282:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:relationship even there is only very little difference in mean, variance, skewness, or kurtosis.
4:155:5391:22:22:90:522:260:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Investors may prefer to conclude ASD only if the dominance is nearly almost. Levy, et
4:156:5476:22:22:90:522:238:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:al. (2010) have provided a good solution. They suggest two approaches. We modify their
4:157:5562:22:32:90:191:216:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:suggestion as follows:
4:158:5584:32:22:106:522:184:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:C:The \frst approach is to check the actual area violationεthat is (signi\fcantly) smaller
4:159:5672:22:22:90:522:162:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:C:than1/2.  The second approach is to \fnd for a given group of subjects what is the allowed
4:160:5762:22:22:90:522:140:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:C:area violation by each investor and whether for all subjects belonging to this group the allowed
4:161:5858:22:15:90:350:118:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:C:area violation is greater than the actual area violation.
4:162:5915:15:15:102:521:103:6:g_d0_f18:9:g_d0_f19:F:1We  note  that  the  theory  can  be  extended  to  satisfy  utilities  defined  to  be  non-differentiable  and/or

5:165:6166:0:22:106:521:758:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:A:In this paper, we extend their work by first recommending an existing stochastic domi-
5:166:6252:22:22:90:522:736:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:nance test to handle the issue and thereafter developing a new test for the ASD which could
5:167:6343:22:22:90:522:714:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:detect dominance for any pre-determined small value. We first recommend an existing s-
5:168:6429:22:29:90:395:692:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:tochastic dominance test to handle the issue in next subsection.
5:169:6493:29:29:90:320:663:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:3.1  Initial Stochastic Dominance Test
5:170:6531:29:22:90:522:634:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:There are several SD tests. Among them, there are two broad classes of SD tests. One is the
5:171:6622:22:22:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:minimum/maximum statistic, while the other is based on distribution values computed on a
5:172:6710:22:22:90:522:590:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:set of grid points. McFadden (1989) first develops a SD test using the minimum/maximum
5:173:6796:22:22:90:522:568:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:statistic. Later on, Barrett and Donald (2003) develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type test
5:174:6881:22:22:90:522:546:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:and Linton et al. (2005) extend their work to relax the iid assumption.  On the other
5:175:6966:22:22:90:522:524:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:hand, the SD tests developed by Anderson (1996) and Davidson and Duclos (DD, 2000)
5:176:7048:22:22:90:522:502:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:compare the underlying distributions at a finite number of grid points whereas Bai, et
5:177:7134:22:22:90:522:480:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:al. (2011) extend their work by deriving the limiting distributions of the test statistics
5:178:7224:22:22:90:522:458:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:to be stochastic processes, proposing a bootstrap method to decide the critical points of
5:179:7313:22:22:90:522:436:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:the tests and proving the consistency of the bootstrap tests. The advantages of the DD
5:180:7399:22:21:90:522:414:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:test are (1) it has been examined to be one of the most powerful approaches and yet less
5:181:7487:21:22:90:522:393:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:conservative in size (see Tse and Zhang, 2004; Lean et al., 2008), and (2) it compares
5:182:7573:22:22:90:522:371:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:the underlying distributions at a finite number of grid points which, in turn, tells us the
5:183:7664:22:22:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:percentage of one prospect dominating another and vice verse. This information is useful
5:184:7752:22:22:90:522:327:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:for decision makers to determine the ASD relationship among the prospects and thus we
5:185:7837:22:22:90:522:305:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:first recommend decision makers to apply the DD test to determine the ASD relationship
5:186:7923:22:22:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:among the prospects. Readers may refer to Davidson and Duclos (2000) and Bai, et al.

6:219:8959:32:21:106:521:544:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:A:The modified DD test compares distributions at a finite number of grid points. Various
6:220:9045:21:22:90:522:523:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:studies examine the choice of grid points. For example, Tse and Zhang (2004) show that
6:221:9131:22:22:90:522:501:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:an appropriate choice ofKfor reasonably large samples ranges from 6 to 15. Too few grids
6:222:9219:22:22:90:522:479:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:will miss information about the distributions. To solve this problem, Lean, et al. (2007),
6:223:9309:22:22:90:522:457:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Wong, et al. (2008), Qiao, et al. (2012), and others suggest to use the 10 major partitions

6:225:9487:22:22:90:522:413:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:and draw statistical inference. We recommend to use the simulated critical value suggested

6:230:9850:22:29:89:400:303:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:than 1/2, then we conclude thatF≽almost(ε0)nGforn= 1,···,4.

10:456:15352:33:22:90:522:446:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Leshno and Levy (2002) extend it to the stochastic dominance (SD) theory of almost s-
10:457:15437:22:21:90:521:424:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:tochastic dominance (ASD) formostdecision makers. When comparing any two prospects,
10:458:15520:21:22:90:522:403:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:Guo, et al. (2013) find that there will be ASD relationship even there is only very little
10:459:15610:22:22:90:522:381:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:difference in mean, variance, skewness, or kurtosis. Investors may prefer to conclude ASD
10:460:15699:22:22:90:522:359:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:only if the dominance is nearly almost. Levy, et al. (2010) have provided two approaches to
10:461:15790:22:22:90:522:337:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:solve the problem. In this paper, we extend their work by first recommending an existing
10:462:15878:22:22:90:522:315:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:stochastic dominance test to handle the issue and thereafter developing a new test for the
10:463:15968:22:22:90:522:293:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:ASD which could detect dominance for any pre-determined small value. We also provide
10:464:16052:22:0:90:446:271:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:B:two approaches to obtain the critical values for our proposed test statistic.
