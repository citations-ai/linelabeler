2:16:427:40:18:275:319:523:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:Abstract
2:17:435:18:12:160:449:505:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:This brief paper derives the value of headway, i.e. the time interval
2:18:504:12:12:145:449:493:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:between departures, for a scheduled service. It presents a consistent
2:19:573:12:12:145:449:481:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:framework in which users have scheduling costs, time costs and plan-
2:20:641:12:12:145:449:469:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:ning costs. The model represents both users who arrive at the station
2:21:710:12:12:145:449:457:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:to choose just the next departure and users who plan for a specific de-
2:22:781:12:12:145:449:445:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:parture. Planning for a specific departure is costly but becomes more
2:23:850:12:12:145:449:433:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:attractive at longer headways.  Simple expressions for the user cost
2:24:918:12:12:145:449:421:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:result. In particular, the marginal cost of headway is large at short
2:25:987:12:12:145:449:409:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:headways and smaller at long headways. The difference in marginal
2:26:1052:12:34:145:394:397:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:costs is the value of time multiplied by half the headway.
2:27:1110:34:24:117:230:363:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:1  Introduction
2:28:1125:24:14:117:476:339:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:This paper presents an economic analysis of the value of headway for a
2:29:1195:14:14:117:476:325:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:scheduled service such as a bus route, a train or an air connection. Such an
2:30:1271:14:13:117:476:311:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:analysis seems to be lacking in the literature. The problem derives from the
2:31:1347:13:14:117:476:298:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:(rather obvious) observation that users of scheduled services cannot choose
2:32:1422:14:13:117:476:284:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:their departure time freely, they are constrained to the departure times of
2:33:1497:13:14:117:476:271:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:the service, where the headway is the time between departures.  It then
2:34:1568:14:13:117:476:257:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:becomes important to know how the size of the headway affects user costs.
2:35:1641:13:14:117:476:244:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Insights into this may inform analyses of demand as well as welfare economic
2:36:1717:14:13:117:476:230:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:analyses of changes in the supply of scheduled services. There seems to be
2:37:1791:13:14:117:312:217:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:no analysis in the literature of this issue.
2:38:1835:14:13:134:476:203:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:For a frequent service we may imagine users do not plan to use a specific
2:39:1908:13:14:117:476:190:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:departure, they just arrive in order to catch the next departure. From their
2:40:1984:14:14:117:476:176:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:perspective, the time to the next departure is random. This observation has
2:41:2059:14:13:117:476:162:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:led many to include just the average waiting time, half the headway, into the
2:42:2136:13:14:117:476:149:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:user cost. In the present case that accounts for scheduling considerations,
2:43:2211:14:13:117:476:135:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:they are seen to incur costs of waiting as well as costs due to the uncertainty
2:44:2290:13:0:117:408:122:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:about the time at which they will arrive at their destination.
3:45:2353:0:14:134:476:704:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:For a less frequent service we may imagine that users plan which de-
3:46:2421:14:13:117:476:690:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:parture they want to use.  In this case, the choice of service is based on
3:47:2495:13:14:117:476:677:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:scheduling considerations. The choice between planning and not planning
3:48:2566:14:14:117:476:663:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:we can imagine is governed by a cost of planning, which may include the
3:49:2637:14:13:117:476:649:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:effort involved in consulting the time table, the timing of the trip to the
3:50:2712:13:14:117:345:636:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:station as well as a planned wait at the station.
3:51:2761:14:13:134:476:622:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:We consider a scheduled service that runs with a time interval between
3:52:2831:13:14:117:476:609:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:departures ofhminutes.  In other words,his the headway.  We are not
3:53:2898:14:13:117:476:595:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:concerned with the travel time on the service and take this to be simply
3:54:2970:13:14:117:476:582:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:zero in order to simplify the analysis. Hence a user who boards the service
3:55:3045:14:13:117:476:568:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:at timetalso arrives at timet.If the travel time is known and not random,
3:56:3118:13:14:117:476:555:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:the cost of travel time may just be added to the cost expression obtained in
3:57:3194:14:14:117:173:541:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:this papers.
3:58:3206:14:13:134:476:527:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:The present analysis is based on scheduling preferences (Vickrey,1969;
3:59:3276:13:14:117:476:514:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Small,1982;Arnott et al.,1993), where the user cost is described in terms
3:60:3349:14:13:117:476:500:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:of travel time and a scheduling cost given as a function of the time of ar-
3:61:3424:13:14:117:476:487:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:rival at the destination relative to a preferred arrival time.  We consider
3:62:3499:14:13:117:476:473:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:a continuum of users, each of whom has a preferred arrival time (PAT),
3:63:3569:13:14:117:476:460:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:such that the PATs are uniformly distributed over time. Consider a user
3:64:3640:14:13:117:476:446:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:who has scheduling cost given by the functionDand a preferred arrival
3:65:3709:13:14:117:476:433:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:time (PAT)t∗,such that the scheduling cost of actually arriving at time
3:66:3780:14:13:117:476:419:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f9:tisD(t−t∗).The simplest case ofDarises whenD(s)=γs++βs−.In
3:67:3838:13:14:117:476:406:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:general we assume thatDis convex with a minimum atD(0)=0and that
3:68:3902:14:14:117:476:392:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f9:−D′(0−)< D′(0+).It is customary also to allow for a convex or linear
3:69:3970:14:13:117:476:378:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:time costA(·)withA(0)=0andA′> 0that is a function of travel time
3:70:4034:13:14:117:476:365:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:such that the total time cost becomesA+D.In the linear case we define
3:71:4103:14:13:117:476:351:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f9:A(t)=αtand get the(α, β, γ)−framework that has been used in many
3:72:4167:13:14:117:476:338:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:papers. A user who arrives at the station at timet1and catches a service
3:73:4239:14:13:117:393:324:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f11:at timet2then incurs a total cost ofA(t2−t1)+D(t2).
3:74:4290:13:14:134:476:311:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:The layout of the paper is the following. Section2treats the case of long
3:75:4363:14:13:117:476:297:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:headways where the users plan which departure to use. Section3treats the
3:76:4435:13:14:117:476:284:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:case of a frequent service where users do not bother to consult the time
3:77:4507:14:13:117:476:270:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:table but merely appear at the station to catch the next departure. Section
3:78:4582:13:14:117:476:257:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:4integrates these two cases through the concept of a planning cost, such
3:79:4654:14:14:117:476:243:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:that users will plan for a specific departure if the benefit of planning exceeds
3:80:4734:14:34:117:460:229:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:the cost. Section5discusses how the model may be applied in practice.
3:81:4803:34:24:117:344:195:14:g_d0_f10:14:g_d0_f10:2  A service with long headway
3:82:4833:24:14:117:476:171:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:We first consider the case of a service with long headways, where a user
3:83:4905:14:13:117:476:157:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:plans which departure he wants to use. He does not wait and so his cost is
3:84:4979:13:14:117:476:144:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:given only in terms of the scheduling cost functionD. The time costAis
3:85:5049:14:0:117:476:130:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:not relevant. Instead of thinking of users being uniformly distributed over
4:86:5125:0:14:117:476:704:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:time, we may take the perspective of a single user and consider arrivals to
4:87:5200:14:13:117:476:690:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:be uniformly distributed over time. We may take a user with PAT=0 as
4:88:5268:13:14:117:242:677:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:representative of all users.
4:89:5296:14:21:134:281:663:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Consider the timetdefined by

4:100:5542:25:13:134:476:256:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f11:The equation (1) states that the user is indifferent between arrivingt
4:101:5612:13:14:117:476:243:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:minutes late and−(t−h)minutes early. Anything in between is preferred.
4:102:5682:14:13:117:476:229:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Since the travel time on the service is normalised to zero, he will choose a
4:103:5758:13:14:117:476:216:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:departure in the interval[t−h, t]defined by (1) and be at mosttminutes
4:104:5828:14:13:117:476:202:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:late. With departures considered to be uniformly distributed over time, the
4:105:5903:13:28:117:270:189:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:expected scheduling cost is then

5:114:6105:0:14:117:475:704:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:Since the user with PAT=0 is representative, we have thatCp(h)is the

7:284:9508:13:14:117:476:531:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:situations. In one the users are assumed to plan for a specific departure while
7:285:9587:14:13:117:476:517:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:they are not planning in the other. Otherwise the situations are completely
7:286:9662:13:14:117:476:504:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:identical. To complete the story, we therefore need to explain why some
7:287:9733:14:13:117:476:490:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:users plan and other do not. At the same time we want the model to have
7:288:9804:13:14:117:437:477:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:the property that planning is more worthwhile at longer headways.

7:291:10007:14:13:117:476:436:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:plan, then his cost isαh/2+Cp(h). Choosing the minimum cost option, he
7:292:10077:13:14:117:476:423:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:will then plan ifζ < αh/2. Assume that planning costs are distributed in

8:360:10985:25:13:117:476:679:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:For the application of the model we need to know first the scheduling pref-
8:361:11060:13:14:117:476:666:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:erences. We assume linear scheduling costs expressed by(α, β, γ)and that
8:362:11132:14:13:117:476:652:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:these have been estimated. A number of studies have estimated these param-
8:363:11206:13:14:117:476:639:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:eters, e.g.Bates et al.(2001) andSmall(1982), see the review inFosgerau
8:364:11277:14:13:117:476:625:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:et al.(2008). The parameterαmay be thought to equal the value of travel
8:365:11348:13:14:117:476:612:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:time. If the marginal cost of waiting time is thought to be higher, the value
8:366:11425:14:14:117:476:598:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f11:ofαmay be increased correspondingly, while keeping the values ofβandγ

8:368:11500:13:14:134:476:571:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:It is harder to presume that we know the distribution of planning costs
8:369:11571:14:13:117:476:557:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:in the population. The planning cost makes no difference if we desire to
8:370:11643:13:14:117:476:544:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:compare two services where either all users plan or all users do not plan.
8:371:11717:14:13:117:476:530:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:It is however necessary to know the cost distribution in order to account

8:375:12004:14:14:117:476:476:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:who will choose a specific departure at different headways. For example, one
8:376:12080:14:13:117:476:462:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:may observe when passengers arrive at train platforms and which departure
8:377:12153:13:14:117:476:449:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:they get on. If users arrive at a constant rate then we may think they are not
8:378:12231:14:13:117:476:435:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:planning. If on the other hand they all arrive close to the next departure,
8:379:12306:13:14:117:476:422:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:then we may think they are all planning. In between we will have some users
8:380:12381:14:13:117:476:408:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:arriving at random and some users arriving close to the next departure. If
8:381:12455:13:14:117:476:395:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:we can estimate the share of users who plan as a function of headway, and
