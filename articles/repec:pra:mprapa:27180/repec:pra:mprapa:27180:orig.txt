2:20:720:13:14:70:524:580:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Romania.  Taking  into  account  the  information  speed,  the  full  integration  of  the  capital 
2:21:820:14:14:70:524:566:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:markets and  the commercial integration, the economic crisis of 2008 is certainly a global one 
2:22:915:14:14:70:524:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:and it has repercussions not only on the Western economies, but it also affects the economy of 
2:23:1010:14:20:70:296:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:other states, resulting in major consequences.

2:28:1163:20:14:106:524:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Over  the  last  period  of  time,  the  financial  crisis was  the  most  common  topic  of 
2:29:1256:14:13:70:524:431:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:discussion maybe overshadowing the debates on terrorism. The lines below will try to touch 
2:30:1347:13:14:70:525:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on the most important aspects of the financial crisis in Romania and to help the readers form 
2:31:1441:14:20:70:247:404:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:an idea about it and reflect on it too. 
2:32:1481:20:14:106:524:384:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:No matters of what type are, all the crises generate sets of problems which are difficult 
2:33:1571:14:14:70:527:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to  solve.  Among  these,  bank  financial  crises  generate  the  greatest  difficulties  for  the 
2:34:1671:14:13:70:524:356:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:economies. Nowadays, because of the total integration of capital market and because of the 
2:35:1762:13:14:70:524:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:communication  and  information,  it  can  be  stated  that  banking  and  financial  shocks  can 
2:36:1860:14:14:70:525:329:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:generate in real time this type of crisis at the global level. Economic crises are interpreted 
2:37:1955:14:20:70:351:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:according to the cycle theory and the fundamental breaks. 
2:38:2013:20:14:106:524:295:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The  interpretation  of  crisis  phenomena  has  generated  many  debates,  no  matter  the 
2:39:2105:14:13:70:524:281:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:period of manifestation, concerning the typology of crisis, the channel of transmission, the 
2:40:2198:13:14:70:524:268:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:management and solving modality, as well as the prevention and treatment of crisis. Although 
2:41:2291:14:14:70:524:254:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the previous crises develop an expectation, a precaution and an avoidance behavior, they still 
2:42:2386:14:14:70:524:240:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:take place. The explanations are many: either the crisis thwarted the precaution measures, or 
2:43:2480:14:13:70:524:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the precaution measures have been minimized, not to speak of the conspiracy theories. It can 
2:44:2573:13:14:70:524:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be observed that most crises come with new essential features the moment they take place. 
2:45:2663:14:14:70:524:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:This is also evident in the context of the present crisis in 2008. But if it is about a crisis, what 
2:46:2764:14:20:70:291:185:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:type is it and in what context has it occurred? 
2:47:2812:20:14:106:524:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:We can find the economic crises in the specialty literature interpreted from the view of 
2:48:2901:14:13:70:524:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the cycle theory and of the fundamental breaks. In the first approach the theory of crises is an 
2:49:2998:13:14:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:aspect of the cycle theory (Haberler G, 1937). Thus, the crisis is a moment of the cycle, where 
2:50:3094:14:14:70:524:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the  growth  stage  is  compressed,  more  or  less  dramatic  phenomena  taking  place:  inflation, 
2:51:3195:14:14:70:524:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:recession, unemployment or worse, depression. If these phenomena take place at the same 
2:52:3283:14:0:70:212:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:time, the crisis is a deep one. 
3:53:3315:0:14:106:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In the latter approach, the crisis represents a major break caused by an unexpected 
3:54:3399:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:shock  of  different  types:  political,  economic  or  social.  The  economic  shocks  can  be 
3:55:3495:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:exogenous when they cannot be explained by an economic model and endogenous when they 
3:56:3581:14:14:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are  generated  by  externalities.  In  fact,  newer  theories  and  instruments,  such  as  nonlinear 
3:57:3684:14:13:70:525:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dynamics,  allow  the  emphasis  of  the  endogenous  shock,  not  necessary  by  means  of 
3:58:3776:13:20:70:329:691:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:externalities, but by the economy's functioning itself. 
3:59:3832:20:14:106:524:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Another common point is the economy qualitative leap from the normal growth stage 
3:60:3914:14:14:70:524:657:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to another one, more or less critical. This discontinuity can be practically analyzed by means 
3:61:4009:14:20:70:402:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of mathematic models, from the theory of catastrophes, of chaos etc. 
3:62:4078:20:13:106:524:623:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:There is not a certain typology of crises. They can be regrouped according to their 
3:63:4162:13:14:70:524:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:causes, to their impact, but also to the way they are approached by specialists. An example is 
3:64:4257:14:14:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:represented by the banking and financial crises which generate the greatest problems that need 
3:65:4352:14:14:70:524:582:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:to be solved. Nowadays, due to globalization and deregulation, to the total integration of the 
3:66:4447:14:14:70:524:568:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:capital market but also to communication and information, it can be stated that banking and 
3:67:4539:14:13:70:524:554:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:financial shocks can generate this type of crisis at the global level, in real time. Not always the 
3:68:4639:13:14:70:524:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bankruptcy  of  a  great  credit  institution  generates banking  and  financial  crises,  even  at  a 
3:69:4742:14:14:70:524:527:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:national  level.  These  phenomena  generate  considerable  crises  if  they  are  accompanied  by 
3:70:4841:14:14:70:524:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:certain structural causes but also by important circumstantial factors. In this context, there will 
3:71:4941:14:14:70:524:499:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be  enumerated  the  main  banking  financial  crises  with  powerful  effects  on  the  collective 
3:72:5041:14:19:70:116:485:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:memory. 
3:73:5049:19:14:106:527:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The 1929 global crisis is the most important one in the history of mankind. Galbraith 
3:74:5135:14:14:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:interprets  the  financial  crash  in  1929  according  to  a  speculative  phenomenon,  by  the 
3:75:5232:14:14:70:524:438:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:explosion  of  a  “financial  bubble”  which  occurred  in  March  1929.  The  behavior  of  the 
3:76:5329:14:14:70:525:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:investors was to get into debt, to place more money in eligible investments, believing in a 
3:77:5421:14:13:70:524:410:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:permanent growth of stock exchanges. This fact overcharged the market, which collapsed in 
3:78:5511:13:14:70:524:397:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:October 1929. Friedman and Schwartz indict the Federal Reserve responsibility, not for the 
3:79:5601:14:14:70:524:383:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:release of crisis but for its worsening. The banking support was belated and useless. The sharp 
3:80:5697:14:20:70:473:369:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:financial crisis has spread to all real economy bringing about a dramatic recession.  
3:81:5782:20:14:106:524:349:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The financial market had known in 1987 a spectacular collapse similar to that in 1929 
3:82:5868:14:13:70:527:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:only by share index. The crisis result concerning real economy was reduced by the banking 
3:83:5958:13:14:70:524:322:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:support. The 1997 global crisis took place in Asia, affecting Russia, but also countries from 
3:84:6052:14:14:70:524:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Latin America. It manifested itself by collapsing the monetary system from the countries with 
3:85:6146:14:14:70:524:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:emergent  economy.  Certain  results  had  influenced  the  macroeconomic  indicators  of 
3:86:6236:14:13:70:524:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:convergent economies one year after the crisis release. At all these it can be added the crises 
3:87:6332:13:14:70:524:267:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:of the monetary systems from Scandinavian countries at the end of '80, of American saving 
3:88:6422:14:20:70:412:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:banks from the same period, of the Mexican crises from 1994 to 1995. 
3:89:6491:20:14:106:524:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Every  crisis  has  a  combination  of  structural  causes  with  essential  circumstantial 
3:90:6583:14:14:70:524:219:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:elements.  The  external  deficit,  the  overproduction,  the  under  consumption,  the  industrial 
3:91:6683:14:13:70:524:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:innovation rate, the impact of technical progress, over accumulation, dynamic indebtedness 
3:92:6774:13:14:70:527:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are among the structural causes. Of course, these phenomena can be favorable each by one, 
3:93:6863:14:14:70:524:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:but by the combination of these ones with one or more circumstantial factors an amplitude 
3:94:6953:14:14:70:524:164:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:crisis can take place. The commentaries of the public authority, announcing a low yield, the 
3:95:7046:14:20:70:357:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bankruptcy of a bank can constitute a circumstantial factor. 
3:96:7107:20:13:106:524:130:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Taking into account the information speed, the full integration of capital markets, the 
3:97:7195:13:14:70:524:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:commercial opening, the economic crisis of 2008 is certainly a global one. The deep crisis in 
3:98:7289:14:14:70:524:103:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the U.S. banking system and then in the stocks exchange in the whole world lead us to state 
3:99:7381:14:14:70:524:89:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:that  the  crisis  which  started  in  2008  is  definitely  a  banking-financial  one.  It  is  difficult  to 
3:100:7492:14:0:70:524:75:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:determine what has generated the crisis. Even a set of anticipation is hard to find. Probably, 
4:101:7587:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:overproduction  phenomena  combined  with  under  consumption  phenomena  but  also  the 
4:102:7676:14:14:70:524:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:extremely  high  budget  deficit  led  the  banks  to  stimulate  the  indebtedness  of  the  state, 
4:103:7777:14:14:70:524:732:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:population and even on itself. But excessive indebtedness of the population, as well as the 
4:104:7869:14:20:70:323:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:banks, led to the emergence of the speculative gaps. 
4:105:7922:20:13:106:524:698:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Romanian  banking  segment  is  affected  by  the  financial  crisis  in  the  U.S.,  due  to 
4:106:8016:13:14:70:524:685:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:increase in the price interbank funding, over assessment of the real estate segment and the 
4:107:8108:14:14:70:524:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:suspicion which is manifested between banks, even if their exposition on the market is tiny 
4:108:8200:14:14:70:524:657:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:substandard. This distrust makes them reluctant about lending each other. Local banks are not 
4:109:8294:14:14:70:524:643:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:suspected to have major exposure on the U.S. market, however, the impossibility to separate 
4:110:8386:14:19:70:382:629:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the banks exposed to the unexposed, raise the price of liquidity.  
4:111:8453:19:14:106:524:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The Romanian economy has been able to cope significantly  well with the multiple 
4:112:8534:14:14:70:524:596:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:external shocks: 8-9% economic growth is by far the strongest in the EU, while inflation has 
4:113:8627:14:14:70:524:582:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:started on a downward trend, the foreign deficit appears to be stabilized, the banking system

4:116:8904:13:14:70:524:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Romania). The head of the central bank said that even though some of the parent banks had 
4:117:8994:14:14:70:524:527:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:reported  losses  as  a  result  of  their  exposure  to  the  American  banks  that  had  filed  for 
4:118:9096:14:14:70:524:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:bankruptcy, these losses had not affected the operations of Romanian subsidiaries. Overall,

4:120:9284:14:13:70:524:485:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:backed by the solid domestic growth. However, he warned that it would be a mistake to be 
4:121:9373:13:20:70:397:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:euphoric because Romania had not suffered as a result of the crisis.

5:148:10501:14:14:70:524:718:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the financial system is primitive, but because Romanian banks have stayed away from “toxic” 
5:149:10593:14:19:70:519:704:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:lending products, and that happened because of the severe lending requirements of the NBR.

7:230:16231:13:14:70:524:541:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:people, Romradiatoare SA - 95 people, Viromet SA - 296 people, Electroprecizia SA - 229 
7:231:16319:14:14:70:524:527:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:people, Marub Industry - 70 people and Fabrica de Scule Râșnov - 12 people. The employees 
7:232:16409:14:14:70:524:513:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:dismissed will receive unemployment aid, in accordance with the Law 76/2002 on the welfare 
7:233:16500:14:20:70:280:499:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:system and the stimulation of employment. 
7:234:16542:20:13:106:524:479:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Tourism will also suffer in the next years because of the global economic crisis, as the 
7:235:16631:13:14:70:524:466:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:prices will increase, and people will be more careful when they spend their money. This will 
7:236:16724:14:14:70:524:452:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:happen, because everything will be more expensive and people will have to take care how 
7:237:16812:14:14:70:524:438:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:they spend money. There will be financial and economic limitations, and certainly there will 
7:238:16905:14:20:70:192:424:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:be a decrease in tourism. 
7:239:16931:20:13:106:524:404:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Romania’s tourism minister Elena Udrea said, within the International Tourism Fair in 
7:240:17017:13:14:70:524:391:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Madrid, that she disagrees with selling, during this period, the participations owned by the 
7:241:17110:14:14:70:524:377:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:ministry in several hotel companies, arguing that the ministry would obtain low prices in the 
7:242:17203:14:14:70:524:363:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:fallout of the economic crisis. Udrea highlighted that, when the ministry decides to sell its 
7:243:17297:14:14:70:524:349:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:participations in hotel companies, the sale process would be transparent, arguing the sale will 
7:244:17393:14:13:70:524:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:not be unfolded on secondary markets. Sources close to the matter said in October 2008 that 
7:245:17485:13:14:70:524:322:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the former leader of the Tourism Ministry initiated the sale procedure on the capital market of 
7:246:17581:14:14:70:524:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:its stakes in several hotel companies, among which, Athenee Palace, Lido, Robinson Predeal, 
7:247:17673:14:20:70:283:294:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:through the law firm “Boștină și Asociații”. 
7:248:17718:20:13:106:524:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The ministry owns majority stakes in four hotel companies, namely, a 90% stake in 
7:249:17800:13:14:70:525:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Predeal, 82.27% in Litoral Constanta, 96.57% in Mamaia and 52.22% in Neptun-Olimp, as 
7:250:17886:14:20:70:515:247:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:well as minority stakes in Athenee Palace - 33.98%, Lido - 42.87% and Robinson - 21.59%. 
7:251:17975:20:14:106:524:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:Even though most economic sectors have been affected by the economic crisis, there 
7:252:18058:14:14:70:524:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:are exceptions. One of the exceptions is the media business who had to won from the crisis, 
7:253:18150:14:19:70:239:199:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:especially in view of the audience. 
7:254:18186:19:14:106:524:180:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In Romania, articles related to the crisis have kept the first page of most publications 
7:255:18275:14:14:70:524:166:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:business. In the case of financial newspaper, last weeks brought at least an article about this 
7:256:18371:14:14:70:524:152:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:subject on the first page. Capital weekly was targeted by articles about the effects of the crisis 
7:257:18470:14:14:70:524:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:on  the  final  consumer,  following  at  the  same  time  projection  on  various  fields,  from  the 
7:258:18573:14:19:70:212:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:capital market in auto sector. 
7:259:18604:19:14:106:524:105:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In  addition  to  the  print  media,  the  evolution  of  the  business  sites  shows  a  major 
7:260:18700:14:14:70:524:91:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:interest in this subject too. According to www.trafic.ro, the number of people who accessed 
7:261:18792:14:0:70:524:77:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:the Business Standard site www.standard.ro in September is higher with 19.9% compared to 
8:262:18881:0:14:70:524:760:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:August,  while  www.ZF.ro  recorded  an  increase  of  10.8%,  www.wall-street.com  increased 
8:263:18975:14:20:70:317:746:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:with 17.6%, and www.dailybusiness.ro with 9.7%. 
8:264:19023:20:14:106:524:726:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The fall of the banking system has led to the downfall of the financial system in U.S. 
8:265:19110:14:14:70:524:712:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:From this moment the crisis has become global. The American stock exchange fall has led, in 
8:266:19202:14:13:70:524:698:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:real  time,  to  other  major  stock  exchange  falls  in  the  world.  The  global  crisis  has  been 
8:267:19305:13:14:70:524:685:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:generalized by reinforcing regional crisis. What is worse is that the domino effect of the crisis 
8:268:19403:14:20:70:312:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:has also affected the well-balanced entrepreneurs. 
8:269:19454:20:14:106:524:651:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:In these circumstances it is logical to assert that a slow down of the U.S. economy will 
8:270:19543:14:14:70:524:637:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:lead the world into a global crisis. And why an economy with such spectacular growth in the 
8:271:19635:14:13:70:524:623:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:past eighty years, slows down when there are so many emerging economies in the world? It is 
8:272:19727:13:20:70:436:610:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:possible to have significant influences on the part of the Chinese economy? 
8:273:19803:20:14:106:524:590:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:The  answers  to  these  questions  may  be  all  questions.  But  with  much  precaution, 
8:274:19894:14:14:70:524:576:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:responsibility,  in  a  few  words,  safe  knowledge,  episteme  and  less  opinion  and  conjectural 
8:275:19996:14:14:70:524:562:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:knowledge can give answers to these questions. A certain risk must also be assumed, that of 
8:276:20088:14:13:70:524:548:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:incomplete interpretation, the remoteness of certainty because the human nature is unable to 
8:277:20181:13:14:70:524:535:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:hold  unlimited  net  information.  It  is  very  possible  that,  besides  the  economic  causes  of  a 
8:278:20286:14:14:70:524:521:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:crisis, there is also a special type of cases, among which the most important appear to be 
8:279:20377:14:20:70:113:507:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:cultural.
