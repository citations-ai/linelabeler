2:32:1542:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:This paper takes a skeptical look at a leading argument about what is causing the foreclosure crisis
2:33:1642:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:and distills some potential lessons for policy. We use an economic model to focus on two key decisions:
2:34:1745:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:the borrower’s choice to default on a mortgage and the lender’s subsequent choice whether to renegotiate
2:35:1849:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:or “modify” the loan. The theoretical model and econometric analysis illustrate that “unaffordable”
2:36:1948:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:loans, defined as those with high mortgage payments relative to income at origination, are unlikely
2:37:2047:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:to be the main reason that borrowers decide to default. In addition, this paper provides theoretical results
2:38:2155:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:and empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that the efficiency of foreclosure for investors is
2:39:2255:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:a more plausible explanation for the low number of modifications to date than contract frictions related
2:40:2359:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:to securitization agreements between servicers and investors. While investors might be foreclosing
2:41:2457:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:when it would be socially efficient to modify, there is little evidence to suggest they are acting against
2:42:2563:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:their own interests when they do so. An important implication of our analysis is that the extension
2:43:2662:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:of temporary help to borrowers suffering adverse life events like job loss could prevent more foreclosures
2:44:2768:14:42:72:436:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:than a policy that makes mortgages more “affordable” on a long-term basis.

3:69:3321:0:29:73:209:677:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:70:3336:29:17:91:538:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One of the most important challenges now facing U.S. policymakers stems from the tide
3:71:3421:17:17:73:538:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of foreclosures that now engulfs the country. There is no shortage of suggestions for how
3:72:3510:17:18:73:538:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to attack the problem. One of the most influential strands of thought contends that the
3:73:3597:18:17:73:538:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:crisis can be attenuated by changing the terms of “unaffordable” mortgages. It is thought
3:74:3686:17:17:73:537:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that modifying mortgages is not just good for borrowers in danger of losing their homes but
3:75:3777:17:18:73:538:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also beneficial for lenders, who will recover more from modifications than they would from
3:76:3867:18:17:73:538:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosures. Proponents of this view, however, worry thatwithout government intervention,
3:77:3957:17:17:73:538:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this win-win outcome will not occur. Their concern is that the securitization of mortgages
3:78:4047:17:18:73:538:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has given rise to contract frictions that prevent lenders and their agents (loan servicers)
3:79:4138:18:17:73:481:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from carrying out modifications that would benefit both borrowers and lenders.
3:80:4216:17:17:91:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we take a skeptical look at this argument.  Using both a theoretical
3:81:4299:17:18:73:538:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model and some loan-level data, we investigate two economicdecisions, the borrower’s
3:82:4383:18:17:73:538:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decision to default on a mortgage and the lender’s choice between offering a loan modification
3:83:4477:17:17:73:538:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and foreclosing on a delinquent loan.  We first study the “affordability” of a mortgage,
3:84:4565:17:18:73:537:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:typically measured by the DTI ratio, which is the size of the monthly payment relative to the
3:85:4658:18:17:73:538:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrower’s gross income.1We find that the DTI ratio at the time of origination is not a strong
3:86:4752:17:17:73:537:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predictor of future mortgage default. A simple theoreticalmodel explains this result. While
3:87:4843:17:18:73:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a higher monthly payment makes default more likely, other factors, such as the level of house
3:88:4936:18:17:73:538:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices, expectations of future house price growth and intertemporal variation in household
3:89:5026:17:17:73:538:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income, matter as well. Movements in all of these factors have increased the probability of
3:90:5117:17:18:73:538:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default in recent years, so a large increase in foreclosuresis not surprising. Ultimately, the
3:91:5211:18:17:73:537:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importance of affordability at origination is an empirical question and the data show scant
3:92:5302:17:17:73:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of its importance. We estimate that a 10-percentage-point increase in the DTI
3:93:5388:17:18:73:537:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio increases the probability of a 90-day-delinquency by7 to 11 percent, depending on
3:94:5475:18:17:73:538:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the borrower.2By contrast, an 1-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate raises
3:95:5564:17:17:73:537:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this probability by 10-20 percent, while a 10-percentage-point fall in house prices raises it
3:96:5657:17:18:73:168:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by more than half.
3:97:5675:18:16:87:538:180:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1DTI ratio stands for “debt-to-income” ratio.  A more appropriate name for this ratio is probably
3:98:5772:16:12:73:538:164:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:“payment-to-income” ratio, but we use the more familiar terminology. Throughout this paper, we define
3:99:5873:12:12:73:538:152:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:DTI as the ratio of mortgage-related payments to income, rather than all debt payments; this is sometimes
3:100:5978:12:8:73:193:140:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:called the “front end” DTI.
3:101:6005:8:16:87:537:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2As explained below, these estimates emerge from a duration model of delinquency that are based on
3:102:6103:16:12:73:538:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:instantaneous hazard rates. So, the statement that an 10-percentage-point increase in DTI increases the
3:103:6206:12:12:73:538:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:probability of 90-day delinquency by 7 percent means that the DTI increase multiplies the instantaneous
3:104:6309:12:12:73:538:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:delinquency hazard by 1.07, not that the DTI increase raisesthe probability of delinquency by 7 percentage
3:105:6415:12:0:73:102:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:points.
4:106:6423:0:17:91:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The fact that origination DTI explains so few foreclosures should not surprise economists,
4:107:6513:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:given the mountain of economic research on the sources and magnitude of income variation
4:108:6601:17:17:73:537:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among U.S. residents. The substantial degree of churning inthe labor market, combined
4:109:6686:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the trial-and-error path that workers typically follow to find good job matches, suggests
4:110:6780:18:17:73:537:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that income today is an imperfect predictor of income tomorrow. Consequently, a mortgage
4:111:6868:17:18:73:507:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that is affordable at origination may be substantially less so later on, and vice versa.
4:112:6956:18:17:91:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We then address the question of why mortgage servicers, who manage loans on behalf
4:113:7038:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of investors in mortgage-backed securities, have been unwilling to make mass loan modifi-
4:114:7127:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cations. The evidence that a foreclosure loses money for thelender seems compelling. The
4:115:7215:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servicer typically resells a foreclosed house for much lessthan the outstanding balance on the
4:116:7309:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage, in part because borrowers who lose their homes have little incentive to maintain
4:117:7399:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them during the foreclosure process.3This would seem to imply that the ultimate owners
4:118:7485:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a securitized mortgage, the investors, lose money when a foreclosure occurs. Estimates of
4:119:7577:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the total gains to investors from modifying rather than foreclosing can run to $180 billion,
4:120:7669:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than 1 percent of GDP. It is natural to wonder why investors are leaving so many
4:121:7754:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:$500 bills on the sidewalk. While contract frictions are onepossible explanation, another is
4:122:7846:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the gains from loan modifications are in reality much smaller or even nonexistent from
4:123:7937:17:18:73:215:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the investor’s point of view.
4:124:7966:18:17:91:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We provide evidence in favor of the latter explanation. First, the typical calculation
4:125:8052:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:purporting to show that an investor loses money when a foreclosure occurs does not capture
4:126:8142:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all relevant aspects of the problem. Investors also lose money when they modify mortgages
4:127:8231:18:17:73:537:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for borrowers who would have repaid anyway, especially if modifications are doneen masse,
4:128:8320:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as proponents insist they should be. Moreover, the calculation ignores the possibility that
4:129:8411:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers with modified loans will default again later, usually for the same reason they

4:131:8589:17:17:73:406:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explain why servicers eschew modification in favor of foreclosure.
4:132:8655:17:18:91:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Turning to the data, we find that the evidence of contract frictions is weak, at least if
4:133:8744:18:17:73:537:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these frictions result from the securitization of the loan.Securitization agreements generally
4:134:8838:17:17:73:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instruct the servicer to behave “as if” it owned the loan in its own portfolio, and the data
4:135:8930:17:18:73:537:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are consistent with that principle. Using a dataset that includes both securitized and non-
4:136:9021:18:17:73:537:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitized loans, we show that these two types of loans are modified at about the same
4:137:9108:17:17:73:537:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate. While there is room for further empirical work on this issue, these results minimize
4:138:9198:17:18:73:538:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the likely importance of contract-related frictions in themodification decision. Even though
4:139:9290:18:16:87:538:105:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3An even more important reason that lenders rarely recover the full balance of the mortgage is that the
4:140:9393:16:12:73:538:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:borrower owed more on the home than the home was worth. Below,we show that negative equity is a
4:141:9488:12:0:73:502:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:necessary condition for foreclosure; people rarely lose their homes when they enjoy positive equity.
5:142:9589:0:17:73:537:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it may be insociety’sinterest to make modifications (because of the large externalities from
5:143:9681:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosure), it may not be in thelender’sinterest to do so, whether or not this lender is an
5:144:9774:17:17:73:384:643:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:investor in a mortgage-backed security or a portfolio lender.4
5:145:9836:17:18:91:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our skepticism about the arguments discussed above is not meant to suggest that gov-
5:146:9920:18:17:73:537:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ernment has no role in reducing foreclosures. Nor are we arguing that the crisis is completely
5:147:10014:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unrelated to looser lending standards, which saddled borrowers with high-DTI mortgages,
5:148:10101:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or interest rates that reset to higher levels a few years intothe loans.5Rather, we argue that
5:149:10195:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a foreclosure-prevention policy that is focused on high-DTI ratios and interest-rate resets
5:150:10286:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may not address the most important source of defaults. In thedata, this source appears to
5:151:10375:18:17:73:455:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be the interaction of falling prices and adverse life events, such as job loss.
5:152:10454:17:17:91:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section2 outlines a simple model
5:153:10539:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the default decision that helps organize ideas about potential sources of the foreclosure
5:154:10631:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:crisis. Section 3 shows that, as would be implied by the simple model, the affordability of a
5:155:10724:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage at origination as measured by DTI is not a strong predictor of mortgage default,
5:156:10813:17:18:73:537:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:especially compared with other variables that reflect income volatility and falling house
5:157:10902:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices in a fundamental way. Section 4 adapts the model to encompass the decision of the
5:158:10990:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lender to offer a modification, and then provides evidence that securitization contracts are
5:159:11082:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not unduly preventing modifications. Section 5 concludes with some lessons for foreclosure-
5:160:11173:18:44:73:331:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reduction policy that are suggested by our results.

5:162:11264:29:17:91:537:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One of the most commonly cited causes of the current foreclosure crisis is the mass
5:163:11347:17:18:73:538:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:origination of unaffordable or unsustainable mortgages. Ellen Harnick, the senior policy
5:164:11435:18:17:73:538:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending, characterized the crisis this way when she
5:165:11525:17:27:73:245:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recently testified before Congress:
5:166:11560:27:18:102:508:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The flood of foreclosures we see today goes beyond the typicalforeclosures of
5:167:11637:18:17:102:509:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:years past, which were precipitated by catastrophic and unforeseen events such as
5:168:11718:17:17:102:508:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:job loss, divorce, illness, or death. The current crisis originated in losses triggered
5:169:11805:17:18:102:509:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:by the unsustainability of the mortgage itself, even without any changes in the
5:170:11884:18:18:102:509:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:families’ situation, and even where the family qualified for, but was not offered,
5:171:11966:18:15:87:537:125:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:4A foreclosure imposes externalities on society when, for example, a deteriorating foreclosed home drives
5:172:12071:15:8:73:333:110:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:down house prices for the entire surrounding neighborhood.
5:173:12129:8:16:87:538:102:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:5For a discussion of the role of looser lending standards, seeMian and Sufi (2009) and Dell’Ariccia, Igan,

6:175:12254:0:27:102:315:677:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:a loan that would have been sustainable.6
6:176:12295:27:17:73:538:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The claim that the foreclosure crisis results from unaffordable or unsustainable loans has
6:177:12385:17:17:73:538:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been endorsed by a number of influential policy analysts.7But the concept of “unaffordabil-
6:178:12476:17:18:73:538:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity” is rarely defined precisely. To economists, something is unaffordable if it is unattainable
6:179:12572:18:17:73:538:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:under any circumstances, even temporarily. For example, aneconomist might say: “For me,
6:180:12659:17:18:73:538:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the penthouse apartment at the Time Warner Center in New Yorkis unaffordable ($50
6:181:12740:18:17:73:538:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:million when finished in 2004).” But a non-economist might say, “For me, the dry-aged
6:182:12825:17:17:73:538:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ribeye at Whole Foods ($19.99 a pound) is unaffordable.” The problem is that, for most
6:183:12911:17:17:73:538:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Americans, a regular diet of ribeye steaks is attainable; a consumption bundle that includes
6:184:13003:17:18:73:538:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two pounds of ribeye every night is not impossible for most families. They do not choose this
6:185:13096:18:17:73:537:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bundle because of relative prices: the tradeoff between the ribeye and other consumption
6:186:13184:17:18:73:538:477:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is unappealing (for example, the family might prefer a new car). In this case, economists,
6:187:13274:18:17:73:538:459:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if they were being precise, would say that the ribeye was “affordable” but “too expensive.”
6:188:13365:17:17:73:538:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Along the same lines, economists might argue that an unaffordable mortgage is one that
6:189:13451:17:18:73:538:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is really too expensive, in the sense that the benefits that come with making payments on
6:190:13540:18:17:73:537:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage no longer outweigh the opportunity costs of doing so. In the next subsection,
6:191:13630:17:17:73:538:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we build a simple model of these benefits and costs in order to evaluate what makes a bor-
6:192:13720:17:17:73:537:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rower decide that a mortgage is unaffordable and thus to default on it. In describing this
6:193:13810:17:18:73:538:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model, we will use the common usage definition of “affordable,” though we really mean “too
6:194:13900:18:38:73:131:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expensive.”
6:195:13911:38:25:73:221:300:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2.1  A simple model
6:196:13930:25:18:91:538:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Assume a two-period world (t= 1,2), with two possible future states, good and bad.
6:197:14012:18:17:73:536:257:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f8:B:The good state occurs with probabilityαG, while the bad state occurs with probabilityαB
6:198:14099:17:17:73:538:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(whereαB= 1−αG).  In the first period, the value of the home isP1with a nominal
6:199:14178:17:17:73:537:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage balance ofM1. In this period, the borrower decides between making the mortgage
6:200:14265:17:18:73:538:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:payment, a fractionmof the mortgage balanceM1, and staying in the home, or stopping
6:201:14348:18:18:73:538:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:payment and defaulting. Because this is a two-period model,we assume that in the second

6:203:14457:12:15:87:538:158:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:7A recent report from the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Recovery Program (here-
6:204:14558:15:12:73:538:143:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:after denoted COP) states that “[t]he underlying problem inthe foreclosure crisis is that many Americans
6:205:14662:12:12:73:538:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:have unaffordable mortgages” (COP report, p. 16). The reportadds that the unaffordability problem arises
6:206:14766:12:12:73:538:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:from five major factors: (1) the fact that many mortgages weredesigned to be refinanced and cannot be
6:207:14867:12:12:73:538:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:repaid on their original terms, (2) the extension of credit to less creditworthy borrowers for whom home-
6:208:14972:12:12:73:538:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:ownership was inappropriate, (3) fraud on the part of brokers, lenders, and borrowers, (4) the steering of
6:209:15078:12:12:73:538:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:borrowers who could qualify for lower cost mortgages into higher priced (typically subprime) mortgages,
6:210:15181:12:0:73:240:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:and (5) the recent economic recession.
7:211:15220:0:17:73:537:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period the borrower either sells the home or defaults on the mortgage. If the good state
7:212:15308:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:occurs, the price of the house in the second period isPG2, while if the bad state occurs, the
7:213:15401:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:price isPB2. We will assume thatPB2< M2, whereM2is the remaining nominal mortgage
7:214:15482:17:18:73:223:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance in the second period.
7:215:15511:18:17:91:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The first key insight of the model is that if equity is positive, the borrower will never
7:216:15600:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default on the house. Selling dominates foreclosure when equity is positive because the
7:217:15687:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrower has to move out either way and the former strategy yields cash while the latter
7:218:15775:17:17:73:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does not. Exactly what constitutes positive equity is a bit tricky empirically. Borrowers
7:219:15864:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have to pay closing costs to sell the house and may be forced toaccept a lower price if they
7:220:15956:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sell in a hurry. Thus, the balance of the mortgage may be slightly less than the nominal
7:221:16044:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value of the home, but with these extra expenses factored into the equation, the borrower
7:222:16133:17:18:73:278:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may not have positive equity to extract.
7:223:16173:18:17:91:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The empirical evidence on the role of negative equity in causing foreclosures is over-
7:224:16259:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whelming and incontrovertible. Household-level studies show that the foreclosure hazard
7:225:16346:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for homeowners with positive equity is extremely small but rises rapidly as equity approaches
7:226:16439:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and falls below zero. This estimated relationship holds both over time and across localities,
7:227:16532:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as well as within localities and time-periods, suggesting that it cannot result from the effect
7:228:16627:17:18:73:289:383:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:of foreclosures on local-level house prices.8
7:229:16672:18:17:91:537:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because default does not occur ifP1≥M1, we focus on the case whereM1> P1. The
7:230:16749:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decision for the borrower is whether or not to make the periodic mortgage paymentmM1.
7:231:16834:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The cost of making the payment is the payment amount, net of the rent that the borrower
7:232:16921:18:17:73:537:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would have to pay for shelter in the event of default. The benefit to the borrower includes
7:233:17012:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the option in the next period to sell the house at a profit in thegood state whereP2> M2,
7:234:17101:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or the option to default in the bad state and lose nothing. We assume that the decision to
7:235:17191:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default costs the borrower some amount Λ next period, which can be interpreted as some
7:236:17277:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:combination of guilt, shame, and reduced access to future credit. Under these conditions,
7:237:17366:17:36:73:410:227:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:we can collapse the default decision into the following inequality:9

7:242:17474:34:17:73:538:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The basic point here is that a borrower views the mortgage payment (or more precisely the
7:243:17563:17:18:73:538:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:excess of the mortgage payment over his rent) as an investment in a security that pays off
7:244:17653:18:18:73:538:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the next period as long as the value of the house exceeds thestrike price, which is the

7:246:17839:15:12:73:538:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:default regressions. See Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (2007) for an exhaustive discussion of the identification
7:247:17950:12:8:73:293:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:issues in the study of house prices and foreclosure.

8:250:18171:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment, here assumed to be the riskless rate, then the borrower stays in the home. If
8:251:18260:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:instead the return falls short, then the borrower decides that the riskless asset is a better
8:252:18353:17:18:73:198:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investment and defaults.
8:253:18377:18:17:91:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus far, income appears to play no role in the default decision. In this sense, our
8:254:18461:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model follows the traditional option-theoretic analyses of the mortgage default decision, in
8:255:18553:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which the mortgage is viewed as a security priced by arbitrage, and household income is

8:257:18653:17:18:91:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The problem with the model described above is that it gives norole to individual hetero-
8:258:18741:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:geneity, except potentially through differences in Λ. According to the model, all borrowers
8:259:18832:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:living in similar houses with similar mortgages should default at roughly the same time.
8:260:18920:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Yet, in the data, we observe enormous heterogeneity in default behavior across otherwise
8:261:19008:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar households.  Moreover, there is a pattern to this heterogeneity: households that
8:262:19096:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suffer income disruptions default much more often than households that do not; younger
8:263:19182:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:homeowners default more often; and households with few financial resources default more
8:264:19269:18:17:73:102:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:often.
8:265:19275:17:17:91:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To address these limits, we make two small changes to the model. If we assume that
8:266:19357:17:18:73:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing is a normal good, households that suffer permanent reductions in income will prefer
8:267:19448:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less housing, and thus their alternative rent payment will fall. So we allow rent to vary
8:268:19537:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by individual household, denoting itrenti. But, more significantly, we introduce borrowing
8:269:19627:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:constraints. Borrowing constraints mean that the relevantinterest rate is no longer “the”
8:270:19716:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:riskless rate but the household’s shadow riskless rate. Under the assumption of log utility
8:271:19807:17:37:73:306:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and exponential discounting, this rate equals:

8:286:20134:18:17:73:537:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage. A mortgage is unaffordable if the marginal rate of transformation between cur-
8:287:20222:17:18:73:538:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rent and future consumption implied by the mortgage falls short of the marginal rate of

9:290:20432:30:17:87:538:647:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:1.Low house price appreciation.A higher probability of price appreciation (higher
9:291:20513:17:17:102:538:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:A:αG) increases the expected return to staying in the house. In this sense, our treatment
9:292:20600:17:18:102:538:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:is similar to the standard user cost calculation in the literature, whereby increased
9:293:20685:18:27:102:412:595:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:house price appreciation lowers the cost of owning a home.11

9:296:20900:18:17:102:538:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:this section: Many families, for one reason or another, tookon mortgages with high
9:297:20982:17:17:102:538:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:payments that are likely to dissuade them from keeping theirmortgage current. Typ-

9:299:21145:18:17:102:538:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:ratio. Thus, analysts who believe that this type of unaffordability is at the heart of
9:300:21231:17:27:102:535:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:the crisis often support proposals designed to lower DTI ratios on a long-term basis.

9:304:21552:17:18:102:538:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:rate, which makes staying less attractive. The quote that opens this chapter expresses
9:305:21638:18:17:102:538:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:the view that income shocks were important drivers of foreclosure in the past, but
9:306:21720:17:17:102:537:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:that these shocks are less important today. However, if income shocks are in fact the
9:307:21805:17:18:102:537:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:most important source of distress in the housing market, then a policy that grants
9:308:21887:18:17:102:538:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:troubled borrowers substantial but temporary assistance could be effective. Tempo-
9:309:21969:17:17:102:538:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:rary assistance may not help borrowers facing permanent income shocks, but it would
9:310:22052:17:28:102:341:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:help borrowers undergoing transitory setbacks.

9:312:22181:17:38:102:456:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:constrained and thus more likely to have a high shadow riskless rate.

9:315:22383:18:17:73:538:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f12:B:we can further divide the concept of affordability into what we will callex anteandex

9:319:22730:17:18:73:538:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policymaker needs to forecast the evolution of stochastic variables like income, payments,
9:320:22820:18:0:83:432:68:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:11See Poterba (1984) and, more recently, Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005).
10:321:22898:0:17:73:537:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and house prices, and then choose some threshold probability ofex postunaffordability.
10:322:22984:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f12:B:In this section, to clearly convey our points, we consider anextreme model, in whichex
10:323:23070:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f2:B:postaffordability depends entirely on the ratio of monthly payments to income, the DTI
10:324:23156:17:18:73:537:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio. Thus, our forecasting model will involve only the required monthly payment and the
10:325:23245:18:17:73:169:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrower’s income.
10:326:23263:17:18:91:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To forecast income, we follow the macro literature and assume that changes to the

10:330:23505:31:18:73:538:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We use estimates from Gourinchas and Parker (2002) for the process for the “average person”
10:331:23596:18:17:73:388:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in their sample and assume that the borrower is 30 years old.
10:332:23657:17:17:91:538:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For the monthly payments, we assume that either they are constant, or they follow
10:333:23738:17:18:73:538:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the typical path of a 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). A2/28 ARM is a common
10:334:23818:18:17:73:537:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subprime mortgage that has a fixed payment for the first two years, after which the payment
10:335:23909:17:17:73:537:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is determined by the so-called fully indexed rate, typically hundreds of basis points over the
10:336:24003:17:18:73:538:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:six-month London interbank offered rate (Libor).12We assume that the initial rate is 8.5
10:337:24091:18:17:73:537:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent (the average initial rate for a sample of 2/28 ARMs originated in 2005) and that the
10:338:24183:17:17:73:537:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first adjustment occurred in 2007, when the six-month Libor was 5.25 percent. A spread
10:339:24269:17:18:73:538:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over Libor of 600 basis points was typical during this periodand would imply a fully indexed
10:340:24361:18:17:73:538:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate of 11.25 percent, which generates a payment increase ofroughly one-third. We focus
10:341:24448:17:17:73:538:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the 2/28 ARMs because they were, by far, the most common type of subprime loan and
10:342:24533:17:18:73:538:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have accounted for a hugely disproportionate share of delinquencies and foreclosures in the
10:343:24624:18:17:73:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:last two years. Other loans, like option ARMs, allow for negative amortization and have far
10:344:24715:17:17:73:538:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher payment shocks at reset, but were rarely marketed to subprime borrowers, and thus,
10:345:24804:17:18:73:383:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have not accounted for a large share of problem loans so far.
10:346:24865:18:17:91:538:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f12:A:Table 1 shows some basic results. The first key finding is that the threshold forex post
10:347:24953:17:17:73:538:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:affordability must be much higher than the threshold forex anteaffordability. If one sets
10:348:25042:17:18:73:538:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them equal, then about 70 percent of borrowers will end up with unaffordable mortgages
10:349:25128:18:17:73:538:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at some point in the first three years, even without resets. This is important because it
10:350:25217:17:17:73:537:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:means that one cannot decide onex anteaffordability by using somea prioriidea of what
10:351:25302:17:18:73:538:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is a reasonable amount to spend on housing. In other words, ifspending one third of one’s
10:352:25391:18:17:73:537:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income on housing is considered too much (as low-income housing studies often claim), then
10:353:25481:17:18:73:423:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one has to set theex antecriterion well below 33 percent of income.
10:354:25548:18:0:83:393:76:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:12This spread is determined by the risk characteristics of theborrower.
11:355:25620:0:17:91:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The second finding is that resets are of only limited importance. Many commentators
11:356:25703:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have put the resets at the heart of the crisis, but the simulations illustrate that it is difficult
11:357:25802:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to support this claim. The payment escalation story is relevant if we assume that there is
11:358:25892:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:no income riskandthat the initial DTI is also the threshold forex postDTI. Then loans
11:359:25977:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with resets become unaffordable 100 percent of the time and loans without resets never
11:360:26063:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:become unaffordable. But adding income risk essentially ruins this story. If the initial DTI
11:361:26155:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is also the threshold forex postDTI, then, with income risk, about 70 percent of the loans
11:362:26245:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:will become unaffordable even without the reset. The reset only raises that figure to about
11:363:26336:17:18:73:537:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:80 percent. If, on the other hand, we set theex postaffordability threshold well above the
11:364:26426:18:17:73:537:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:initial DTI, then the resets are not large enough to causeex postaffordability problems.
11:365:26514:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The only scenario in which the reset makes a significant, quantitative impact is when we set
11:366:26606:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the initial DTI very low and the threshold forex postaffordability very high. In this case
11:367:26696:18:17:73:343:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the likelihood of default roughly doubles with resets.
11:368:26750:17:17:91:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The third finding is that setting the right initial DTI can help reduce foreclosures if the
11:369:26841:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f2:B:ex postaffordability criterion is sufficiently high, but this findingis very sensitive to the
11:370:26934:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f12:B:assumption about income volatility. The first column of Panel C shows that if theex post
11:371:27022:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:criterion is 50 percent, then loans with 31 percent DTI at origination become unaffordable
11:372:27112:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only about 16 percent of the time, whereas those with 50 percent DTI do so roughly 70
11:373:27197:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the time. The problem here is that the troubled borrowers who obtain subprime
11:374:27285:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans or who need help right now are unlikely to have the baseline parameters from Gour-
11:375:27373:17:18:73:537:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inchas and Parker (2000). If we assume that they have a standard deviation of transitory
11:376:27461:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks twice as large as average, then column 4 shows that thebenefits of low DTI are
11:377:27546:17:17:73:537:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:much smaller.Going from 38 percent DTI to 31 percent DTI onlylowers the number of
11:378:27627:17:18:73:537:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers who will faceex postunaffordability by 30 percent from 54 percent to 38 percent.
11:379:27717:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Put another way, if our goal is “sustainable” mortgages, neither 31 percent nor 38 percent
11:380:27807:17:44:73:199:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would fit that definition.
11:381:27833:44:29:73:440:200:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:3  Affordability and Foreclosure: Evidence
11:382:27875:29:18:91:537:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this section we perform an empirical analysis of the potential determinants of default
11:383:27964:18:17:73:538:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identified in the previous section, including falling houseprices, labor income shocks, and
11:384:28055:17:17:73:538:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high DTI ratios.  Because a loan that is prepaid is no longer atrisk of default, we also
11:385:28143:17:0:73:364:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investigate prepayments in a competing risks framework.
12:386:28199:0:25:73:144:677:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3.1  Data
12:387:28208:25:17:91:538:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The data used in this paper come from loan-level records, compiled by LPS Applied
12:388:28289:17:17:73:538:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Analytics, Inc., from large loan-servicing organizations.13This dataset has fields for key
12:389:28379:17:18:73:538:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables set at the time of each loan’s origination, including the amount of the loan, the
12:390:28470:18:17:73:538:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:appraised value and location of the property that secures the loan, whether the loan is
12:391:28557:17:17:73:538:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:classified as prime or subprime, whether the loan is a first or second lien, and whether the
12:392:28649:17:18:73:538:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan is held in portfolio or has been packaged into a mortgage-backed security (MBS). We
12:393:28737:18:17:73:538:548:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can also observe a host of interest-rate variables, such as whether the loan is fixed-rate
12:394:28827:17:17:73:537:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or adjustable-rate and the manner in which the interest ratechanges in the latter case.
12:395:28914:17:18:73:537:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Additionally, the performance of each loan can be monitoredover time. For each month
12:396:28998:18:17:73:537:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in which a given loan is in the data, we know its outstanding balance, the current interest
12:397:29089:17:17:73:537:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rate, and the borrower’s payment status (that is, current, 30-, 60-, or 90-days delinquent, in
12:398:29183:17:18:73:538:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosure, etc.). We also know whether a loan ended in payment, prepayment, or default.
12:399:29272:18:17:91:537:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As of December 2008, the LPS dataset covered nearly 60 percent of active residential
12:400:29356:17:17:73:538:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages in the United States, representing about 29 million loans with a total outstanding
12:401:29448:17:18:73:538:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance of nearly $6.5 trillion.14Nine of the top 10 servicers in the U.S. are present in our
12:402:29541:18:17:73:537:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data, including Bank of America/Countrywide and Wells Fargo.  Cordell, Watson, and
12:403:29623:17:17:73:538:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thomson (2008) write that because the LPS data come from large servicers (who now
12:404:29704:17:18:73:538:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dominate the servicing market), the unconditional credit quality of the average loan in
12:405:29791:18:17:73:538:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the LPS data is probably lower than that of a randomly sampledU.S. mortgage, because
12:406:29875:17:17:73:537:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smaller servicers are more prevalent in the prime market.  However, when assessing the
12:407:29961:17:18:73:538:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:representativeness of the LPS data, it is important to note that we can tell whether a
12:408:30047:18:17:73:538:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan in the data is prime or subprime.15Additionally, we usually have access to other
12:409:30132:17:17:73:538:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables reflecting risk, including the borrower’s credit(that is, FICO) score, loan-to-value
12:410:30226:17:18:73:519:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at origination, etc. This allows us to condition on several factors affecting loan quality.
12:411:30317:18:17:91:538:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:One of the strengths of the LPS dataset is that it is one of the few loan-level databases
12:412:30406:17:17:73:537:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that include both conforming prime loans and subprime loans. Table 2 lists the numbers
12:413:30492:17:18:73:538:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of prime and subprime loans in the data, disaggregated by theinvestors for whom the
12:414:30575:18:18:73:538:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servicers are processing payments and the seniority of the mortgage (first lien, second lien,
12:415:30668:18:16:83:538:166:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13The dataset was originally created by a company called McDash Analytics; LPS acquired McDash
12:416:30762:16:12:73:538:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in mid-2008. Among housing researchers, the dataset is still generally called the “McDash data.”  The
12:417:30863:12:12:73:538:138:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:description of the LPS dataset in this section draws heavilyfrom Cordell, Watson, and Thomson (2008).
12:418:30964:12:12:73:538:126:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:The dataset was purchased in late 2008 by a consortium that included the Board of Governors of the Federal
12:419:31070:12:8:73:328:114:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Reserve System and eight regional Federal Reserve Banks.
12:420:31126:8:15:83:538:106:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14Because of the size of the data (about 600 gigabytes), we never took possession of it when performing
12:421:31229:15:12:73:538:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:our analysis. Instead we downloaded random samples of various size from the servers of the Federal Reserve
12:422:31335:12:9:73:166:79:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Bank of Kansas City.
12:423:31355:9:0:83:522:70:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:15Subprime loans are defined by the servicers themselves as loans with a grade of either “B” or “C.”
13:424:31457:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:etc.). About 33 percent of the mortgages in the dataset are held in the securities of Fannie
13:425:31549:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Mae, with another 22 percent held in Freddie Mac securities.Around 18 percent of the
13:426:31633:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans are held in “private securitized” pools; these are theloans that are also covered by
13:427:31723:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the well-known LoanPerformance dataset.16A little less than 10 percent of the loans in the
13:428:31813:18:17:73:355:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:LPS data are held in the portfolio of the servicer itself.
13:429:31871:17:18:91:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:While the LPS dataset now covers more than half of the U.S. mortgage market, coverage
13:430:31956:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was not as extensive in earlier years. The LPS dataset has grown over time as new servicers
13:431:32047:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have been added, with a substantial spread in coverage of themarket in 2005 (when most of
13:432:32136:17:18:73:537:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our samples begin). Whenever a new servicer is added to the dataset, that servicer’s existing
13:433:32229:18:17:73:537:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portfolio is incorporated into the dataset. Future loans from that servicer are added a month
13:434:32322:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or two after the loans close. This pattern has the potential to introduce unrepresentative
13:435:32412:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans into the data, because loans that stay active for many years (and thus are likely to be
13:436:32505:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added when their servicers enter the LPS data) are a nonrandom sample of all loans. One
13:437:32592:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:way to ameliorate potential problems of left-censoring is to analyze only those loans that
13:438:32682:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enter the data within the year that the loans were originated.17A separate issue is the fact
13:439:32774:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that not all servicers collected the exact same variables, so the preponderance of missing
13:440:32864:17:17:73:537:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data changes over time. Unfortunately, DTI is recorded for only about half the loans in the
13:441:32955:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sample, as shown in Table 3. On one hand, this is disheartening, because an analysis of
13:442:33042:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:DTI is a prime goal of this section. On the other hand, the sample is sufficiently large that
13:443:33135:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we do not want for observations. Moreover, the fact that DTI is so spottily recorded —
13:444:33221:17:18:73:537:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:especially in comparison to the FICO score — indicates that investors and servicers place
13:445:33310:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:little weight on it when valuing loans. This is, of course, what the model of section 2 would
13:446:33403:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:predict. A final concern about the LPS data is that we do not know whether there are other
13:447:33493:17:18:73:537:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans on the property that secures any given loan. Thus, given some path of local house
13:448:33580:18:17:73:537:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices, we are able to construct an ongoing loan-to-value ratio for any loan in the dataset,
13:449:33672:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but we cannot construct acombinedloan-to-value ratio for the borrower on that loan. We
13:450:33758:17:18:73:447:227:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:are therefore unable to calculate precise estimates of total home equity.18
13:451:33833:18:16:83:538:209:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:16The dataset from LoanPerformance FirstAmerican Corp. includes loans that were securitized outside
13:452:33932:16:12:73:538:193:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of the government-sponsored agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It therefore includes loans that are
13:453:34034:12:12:73:537:181:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:subprime, Alt-A, and non-conforming (that is, jumbo loans). The coverage of private securitized loans is
13:454:34138:12:11:73:538:169:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:broader in the LoanPerformance data than it is in LPS, as LoanPerformance has about 90 percent of the
13:455:34239:11:9:73:164:158:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:private-label market.
13:456:34260:9:12:83:476:149:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:17Most loans in our sample were included in the data one or two months after origination.
13:457:34349:12:15:83:538:137:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:18For a borrower with only one mortgage, the loan-to-value ratio on his single mortgage will, of course,

14:463:34748:17:18:73:538:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comes, we run Cox proportional hazard models for both defaults and prepayments.19In
14:464:34831:18:17:73:538:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this context, the proportional hazard model assumes that there are common baseline hazard
14:465:34920:17:17:73:537:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:functions that are shared by all loans in the data. The model allows for regressors that can
14:466:35012:17:18:73:538:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shift this hazard up or down in a multiplicative fashion. Thespecific type of proportional
14:467:35102:18:17:73:537:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hazard model that we estimate, the Cox model, makes no assumption about the functional
14:468:35188:17:17:73:538:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:form of the baseline hazard. Rather, the Cox model essentially “backs out” the baseline
14:469:35275:17:18:73:538:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hazard after taking account of the effects of covariates. Thebaseline hazards for both po-
14:470:35365:18:17:73:538:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tential outcomes (default and prepayment) are likely to be different across the two types
14:471:35454:17:17:73:538:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of loans (prime and subprime), so we estimate four separate Cox models in all. We define
14:472:35542:17:18:73:538:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default as the loan’s first 90-day delinquency, and our main estimation period runs from
14:473:35630:18:17:73:522:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2005 through 2008. In this section, we use a random 5 percent sample of the LPS data.
14:474:35715:17:17:91:538:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The results of these models should not be interpreted as causal effects. If we see that
14:475:35802:17:18:73:538:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers with low loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) default less often (and we will), we cannot tell
14:476:35897:18:17:73:538:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether this arises because of something about the loan or something about the borrowers
14:477:35985:17:17:73:537:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to choose low-LTV mortgages. Even so, a finding that DTI at origination is not a
14:478:36072:17:18:73:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:very strong predictor of default would undermine the claim that unaffordable mortgages are
14:479:36162:18:17:73:446:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a more important cause of default than income shocks and falling prices.
14:480:36234:17:17:91:537:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 4 presents summary statistics of the loan-level characteristics that are included
14:481:36321:17:18:73:538:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the proportional hazard models. The average DTI at origination for prime loans in our
14:482:36409:18:17:73:538:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sample is 35.1 percent, while the mean DTI for subprime loansis about 5 percentage points
14:483:36498:17:17:73:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher. Subprime loans also have generally higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. Figure
14:484:36582:17:18:73:538:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1 provides some additional detail about these risk characteristics by presenting the entire
14:485:36673:18:17:73:538:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distributions of DTIs, LTVs, and FICO scores. While the distribution of prime DTIs is
14:486:36758:17:18:73:538:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:somewhat symmetric, the distribution of DTIs for subprime loans is strongly skewed, with
14:487:36846:18:17:73:538:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a peak near 50 percent. Another interesting feature of the data emerges in the bottom row
14:488:36935:17:17:73:538:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of panels, which presents LTVs. For both prime and subprime loans, the modal LTV is 80
14:489:37021:17:17:73:538:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent, with additional bunching at multiplies of five lying between 80 and 100. Recall that
14:490:37114:17:18:73:537:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the LPS data, an LTV of 80 percent does not necessarily correspond to 20 percent equity.
14:491:37205:18:17:73:537:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is because the borrower may have used a second mortgage to purchase the home (or
14:492:37290:17:17:73:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may have taken out a second mortgage as part of a refinance). Unfortunately, there is no
14:493:37378:17:18:73:538:94:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:way to match loans to the same borrower in the LPS dataset, noris there a flag to denote
14:494:37466:18:0:83:314:76:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:19For details about hazard models, see Kiefer (1988).
15:495:37521:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether any given loan is the only lien on the property. The large number of 80-percent
15:496:37608:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:LTVs, however, strongly suggests that these loans were accompanied by second mortgages.
15:497:37695:17:17:73:537:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, in our empirical analysis, we include a dummy variablethat denotes whether the
15:498:37779:17:18:73:335:626:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:particular loan has an LTV of exactly 80 percent.20
15:499:37830:18:17:91:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to loan-specific characteristics, the Cox models also include the cumulative
15:500:37918:17:18:73:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in statewide house prices and county-level unemployment rates that have occurred
15:501:38006:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since the loan was originated.21Figures 2 and 3 present the distributions for these data;
15:502:38095:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unlike the figures for DTI, FICO, and LTV, each loan in the sample contributes a number
15:503:38182:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of monthly observations to each of these two figures. Figure 2shows that the distribution
15:504:38271:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of price changes is skewed toward positive changes. In part,this reflects the large number
15:505:38361:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of loans originated in the early years of the sample (2005–2006), when house prices were
15:506:38449:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rising. In our empirical work we allow positive price changes to have different effects than
15:507:38541:18:17:73:198:469:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:negative price changes.22
15:508:38566:17:17:91:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we also include a number of interactions among riskcharacteristics and macro
15:509:38651:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables. These interactions play an important role, given the strong functional form as-
15:510:38741:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sumption embedded in the proportional hazard model. Denoteh(t|xj) as the hazard rate for
15:511:38829:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:either a default or a prepayment, conditional on a vector of covariatesxj. The proportional
15:512:38920:17:18:73:181:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hazard assumption is
15:513:38940:18:25:241:370:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:?:h(t|xj) =h0(t) exp(xjβx),
15:514:38965:25:17:73:537:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whereh0(t) is the shared baseline hazard andβxrepresent coefficient estimates. Because
15:515:39051:17:17:73:538:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exp(β1x1+β2x2) equals exp(β1x1) exp(β2x2), there is in a sense a multiplicative interaction
15:516:39142:17:18:73:538:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:“built in” to the proportional hazard assumption.  Enteringvarious interactions directly
15:517:39230:18:17:73:538:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ensures that interactions implied by the estimated model are not simply consequences of the
15:518:39321:17:17:73:537:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:functional form assumption. Of course, as with any regression, the presence of interactions
15:519:39412:17:18:73:538:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:makes interpretation of the level coefficients more difficult,because the level coefficients will
15:520:39509:18:17:73:538:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:now measure marginal effects at zero values of the other variables. Hence, we subtract 80
15:521:39598:17:17:73:538:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from the loan’s LTV before entering this variable in the regressions. In this way, a value of
15:522:39691:17:18:73:538:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:zero in the transformed variable will correspond to the mostcommon value of LTV in the
15:523:39777:18:17:73:538:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data. We transform DTI by subtracting 35 for prime loans and 40 for subprime loans, and
15:524:39864:17:16:83:538:167:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:20For ease of interpretation, we define this variable to equal one if the borrower doesnothave an LTV of
15:525:39968:16:8:73:121:151:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:80 percent.
15:526:39979:8:16:83:538:143:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:21Obviously, county-level house prices would be preferable to state-level prices, but high-quality, disag-
15:527:40085:16:12:73:538:127:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:gregated data on house prices are not widely available. Our state-level house prices come from the Federal
15:528:40191:12:8:73:359:115:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Housing Financing Authority (formerly the OFHEO price index).
15:529:40252:8:16:83:537:107:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:22Because of the importance of negative equity in default, thedifference between a price increase of 10
15:530:40355:16:12:73:538:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:percent and an increase of 20 percent may be much less consequential for a loan’s outcome than whether
15:531:40457:12:12:73:538:79:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the house price declines by 10 or 20 percent. However, recallthat we cannot figure total equity in the house,
15:532:40566:12:0:73:253:67:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:because we do not observe all mortgages.
16:533:40608:0:17:73:500:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we transform FICO by subtracting 700 for prime loans and 600 for subprime loans.
16:534:40688:17:17:91:537:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 4 graphs the baseline default hazards for both prime and subprime loans. The
16:535:40771:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subprime default hazard (dotted line) is much higher than the hazard for prime loans (note
16:536:40861:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the different vertical scales on the figure).  There is an increase in the subprime default
16:537:40952:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hazard shortly after 24 months, a time when many loans reset to a higher interest rate.
16:538:41039:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:At first blush, this feature of the subprime default hazard would appear to lend support
16:539:41127:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to oft-made claims that unaffordable resets caused the subprime crisis. Recall, however,
16:540:41215:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:B:that a hazard rate measures the instantaneous probability of an event occurring at timet
16:541:41303:17:18:73:537:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among all subjects in the risk pool at timet−1. While the default hazard shows that the
16:542:41390:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default probability rises shortly after 24 months, the subprime prepayment hazard, graphed
16:543:41480:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Figure 5, shows that prepayments also spiked at the same time. The surge in prepayments
16:544:41570:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:means that the relevant pool of at-risk mortgages is shrinking, so that theabsolute number
16:545:41660:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of subprime mortgages that default shortly after the reset is rising to a much smaller extent
16:546:41753:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than the hazard rate seems to imply.  Thus, our results are notinconsistent with other
16:547:41839:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:research that shows that most subprime borrowers who defaulted did so well before their
16:548:41926:18:17:73:135:417:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:reset date.23
16:549:41939:17:17:91:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 5 presents the coefficients from the Cox models. The model for prime defaults
16:550:42022:17:18:73:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(first column) generates a significantly positive coefficientfor the DTI ratio: .0105, with a
16:551:42115:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:state-clustered standard error of .0009. When working withproportional hazard models, it
16:552:42203:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is common to report results in terms of “hazard ratios,” exp(βj), the multiplicative shift
16:553:42293:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the baseline hazard engendered by a unit change in the regressor of interest. The DTI
16:554:42381:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient in the prime default regression generates a hazard ratio of exp(0.0105)≈1.0105,
16:555:42472:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicating that a one-percentage-point increase in DTI shifts the default hazard up by 1.05
16:556:42563:17:18:73:537:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent.24While statistically significant, the effect is small as a practical matter. Recall that
16:557:42660:18:17:73:537:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table 4 showed that the standard deviation of DTI in the primesample is 13.8 percentage
16:558:42747:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points, so a one-standard-deviation increase in DTI for prime borrowers results in a hazard
16:559:42838:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio of exp(13.8-0.0105)≈1.156.This effect can be compared to the effect of decreasing a
16:560:42927:18:17:73:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrower’s FICO score by one standard deviation. The FICO coefficient in the first column
16:561:43016:17:17:73:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(–.0124) has about the same absolute value as the DTI coefficient, but the standard deviation
16:562:43109:17:18:73:537:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in FICO scores is much greater (61.6 points). Thus, a one-standard-deviation drop in the
16:563:43197:18:17:73:429:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:B:FICO score results in a hazard ratio of exp(−61.6-−0.0124)≈2.147.
16:564:43262:17:17:91:538:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Other coefficients in the first column also have reasonable signs and magnitudes. More
16:565:43348:17:18:73:537:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaults are to be expected among loans with high LTVs as wellas loans with LTVs that

16:567:43526:12:16:83:538:93:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:24Because of the way we transformed our variables, this marginal effect corresponds to a prime borrower
16:568:43629:16:0:73:352:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:with a 700 FICO score, a DTI of 35, and an LTV of 80 percent.
17:569:43692:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are exactly 80 percent (and which thus suggest the presence of a second mortgage). The
17:570:43778:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unemployment rate enters the regression with a large coefficient (.2068), so that a one-
17:571:43866:17:17:73:537:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate results in a hazard ratio of about 1.23.
17:572:43957:17:18:73:537:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:House-price changes also enter significantly, though thereis little evidence for different
17:573:44047:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients based on the direction of the price change (both the positive-change and negative-
17:574:44142:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:change coefficients are close to –.058).25These estimates indicate that a 10-percentage-point
17:575:44235:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase in housing prices shifts the hazard down by about 44percent. When evaluating the
17:576:44324:17:17:73:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect of these macroeconomic coefficients on defaults, it is important to recall the earlier
17:577:44417:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualifications about identification.  An exogenous increasein delinquencies may increase
17:578:44505:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:housing-related unemployment and cause housing prices to fall. Nevertheless, it is gratifying
17:579:44598:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to see that the results of the model are consistent with otherwork that shows a direct
17:580:44684:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:causal effect of prices on default in ways that are immune to the reverse-causation argument
17:581:44776:18:17:73:271:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (2007)).
17:582:44814:17:17:91:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:The second column of the table presents the estimates from the subprime default model.26
17:583:44902:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As in the prime column, all of the individual-level risk characteristics enter the model
17:584:44990:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significantly. And, as before, movements in FICO scores havea more potent effect on default
17:585:45081:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than movements in DTI, though the difference is not as extreme. For subprime borrowers, a
17:586:45170:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one standard-deviation increase in DTI results in a hazard ratio of exp(.0072∗11.1) = 1.083.
17:587:45262:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This percentage change is smaller than the corresponding shift for prime mortgages, but
17:588:45349:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recall that the baseline default hazard for subprime mortgages is also much higher. In any
17:589:45439:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case, for subprime loans, the effect of raising DTI by one standard deviation is still smaller
17:590:45533:18:17:73:537:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than the effect of lowering FICO by one standard deviation, shifting the baseline hazard up
17:591:45624:17:17:73:302:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by about 21 percent rather than 8.3 percent.
17:592:45668:17:18:91:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We ran a number of robustness checks to ensure that the small DTI coefficients we
17:593:45749:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:obtained are accurate reflections of the underlying data. Inprincipal, these coefficients could
17:594:45844:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be biased down for two reasons. First, when DTI is recorded noisily, or when borrowers give
17:595:45935:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inaccurate representations of their incomes in order to qualify for loans, then measurement
17:596:46026:18:17:73:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:error will attenuate the DTI coefficients toward zero.  To see how much this matters in
17:597:46113:17:17:73:537:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:practice, we ran the default regressions on fully documented loans only. The DTI coefficients
17:598:46206:17:18:73:537:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in both the prime and subprime default regressions became even smaller when we did so.
17:599:46292:18:17:73:537:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We then estimated on the model only using prime loans held by Fannie Mae or Freddie
17:600:46375:17:18:73:537:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Mac. Again, the prime DTI coefficient becomes smaller.27A second, more serious potential
17:601:46463:18:12:83:447:122:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:25Negative price changes are entered as a negative numbers, not as absolute values.
17:602:46546:12:15:83:538:110:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:26The level coefficients for LTV, FICO, and DTI now correspond tomarginal effects for a subprime
17:603:46642:15:9:73:418:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:borrower with a 600 FICO score, an LTV of 80 percent, and a 40 percent DTI.
17:604:46717:9:15:83:538:86:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:27The subprime coefficient became slightly larger, rising from0.0072 to 0.0127, but Fannie and Freddie
17:605:46819:15:0:73:400:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:hold only about 12 percent of the subprime loans in our regression sample.
18:606:46895:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:source of downward bias arises because we cannot link separate mortgages taken out on
18:607:46980:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the same house. Thus the DTI coefficients in our models reflect the onerousness of first
18:608:47068:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage only. One imperfect way of addressing this issue isto throw out loans that are
18:609:47155:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely to have second mortgages — specifically, the mortgages for which the LTV on the
18:610:47241:18:17:73:537:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:first lien is exactly equal to 80 percent. Our DTI coefficients again become smaller when
18:611:47330:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we do so. However, better data is needed to fully address the role that DTI plays in default
18:612:47422:18:17:73:285:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when more than one mortgage is present.
18:613:47461:17:17:91:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Turning back to the baseline estimates, two additional results from the default regres-
18:614:47548:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sions are consistent with the idea that idiosyncratic income risk is an important determinant
18:615:47641:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of mortgage outcomes. First, among subprime borrowers, theeffect of DTI on the likelihood
18:616:47730:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of default is smaller for borrowers with high FICO scores. The coefficient on the interaction
18:617:47823:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of FICO and DTI in the second column is significantly negative(–.000055, with a standard
18:618:47911:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:error of .000017). Thus, for a subprime borrower with a 700 FICO score, the total marginal
18:619:48001:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect of an increase in DTI on his default probability is only.0017, an effect that is insignif-
18:620:48098:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:icantly different from zero.28The fact that high-FICO borrowers in the subprime pool are
18:621:48186:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:better able to tolerate high DTIs suggests that these borrowers may have been able to make
18:622:48276:17:17:73:537:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:good predictions of their future incomes and of the likely variation in these incomes. These
18:623:48368:17:18:73:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers may have desired high-DTI mortgages that were unattractive to prime lenders,
18:624:48454:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:so they entered the subprime pool. A second set of results pointing to the importance of
18:625:48542:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:income volatility is the coefficients on the unemployment–FICO interactions. These coeffi-
18:626:48632:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cients are significantly negative in both the prime and subprime regressions, indicating that
18:627:48725:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the ARMs of high FICO borrowers are generally hurt more severely, in percentage terms,
18:628:48811:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by increases in the aggregate unemployment rate. If idiosyncratic income variation among
18:629:48899:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high-FICO borrowers is relatively low, then it is perhaps not surprising that their mortgages
18:630:48992:18:17:73:350:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are relatively more sensitive to aggregate fluctuations.
18:631:49048:17:17:91:537:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results from the prepayment regressions are presented in the third and fourth columns
18:632:49133:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of Table 5.  Prime borrowers tend to refinance somewhat more quickly out of high-DTI
18:633:49217:18:17:73:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages, while DTI has an insignificant effect on subprime prepayment. Of particular note
18:634:49308:17:17:73:537:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in both regressions is the strong effect that house prices have on prepayment. The coefficients
18:635:49403:17:18:73:538:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on all price terms are positive, indicating that higher prices encourage prepayment and lower
18:636:49496:18:17:73:537:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices reduce it. The effect of price declines on subprime refinancing is particularly strong.
18:637:49590:17:17:91:538:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 6 puts the pieces together by simulating the number ofmonthly defaults under
18:638:49673:17:18:73:537:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:various assumptions about loan characteristics, house prices, and unemployment. To do this,
18:639:49764:18:16:83:538:105:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:28To see this, note that a 700 FICO score corresponds to a score of 100 in our transformed FICO metric
18:640:49866:16:12:73:538:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for subprime borrowers. Thus, the relevant DTI coefficient for a 700-FICO borrower is the level coefficient
18:641:49973:12:12:73:538:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:on DTI (.0072) plus 100 times the interaction of DTI and FICO (–.000055). This sum approximately equals
18:642:50076:12:0:73:99:65:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:.0017.
19:643:50084:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we first shift the baseline hazards for both default and prepayment to be consistent with the
19:644:50177:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assumptions and the coefficient estimates from the model. We then calculate what these
19:645:50263:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adjusted hazards would imply for the size of an initial risk set of 100 loans.29Multiplying
19:646:50354:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the risk set in a given month times the hazard of either defaults or prepayments gives the
19:647:50444:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:total number of the 100 original loans that are expected to default or prepay in that month.
19:648:50536:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Panel A of Figure 6 presents the data for prime defaults. The solid line assumes a baseline
19:649:50627:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:case of no changes in house prices or unemployment along withthe baseline DTI value (35
19:650:50714:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent for prime loans). The dashed line just above it assumes that DTI is 45 rather than
19:651:50804:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:35. As one would expect from the modest size of the coefficient in the first column of Table
19:652:50896:18:17:73:537:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:5, increasing DTI has a modest effect on monthly defaults. Thenext lines return DTI to 35
19:653:50985:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but either raise the unemployment rate by 2 percentage points or reduce housing prices by
19:654:51074:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:10 percent. These assumptions have a much larger positive effect on prime defaults than the
19:655:51165:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assumption of higher DTI. Falling house prices also strongly discourage prime prepayments,
19:656:51255:17:17:73:180:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as shown in Panel B.
19:657:51275:17:18:91:537:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The bottom two panels of Figure 6 present the results for subprime loans. In Panel C, we
19:658:51363:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:see a small uptick in defaults between 24 and 30 months, presumably due to the interest-rate
19:659:51455:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:resets on subprime 2/28 mortgages. This increase, however,is smaller than the bulge in the
19:660:51545:17:18:73:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:baseline hazard at about this time, because the risk set has been significantly reduced by
19:661:51635:18:17:73:537:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prepayments. Panel C also shows the nearly imperceptible effect of higher DTI. Here, the
19:662:51723:17:17:73:537:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experiment is raising DTI from the baseline subprime value of 40 percent to 50 percent. As
19:663:51813:17:18:73:537:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with prime defaults, the effect of this increase is small relative to the effect of unemployment
19:664:51909:18:17:73:537:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and house prices. Finally, Panel D shows that falling house prices have particularly severe
19:665:52000:17:17:73:307:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effects on the prepayments of subprime loans.
19:666:52045:17:18:91:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The patterns displayed in Figure 6 are consistent with a large role for income volatility
19:667:52134:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in mortgage defaults discussed in section 2. Higher unemployment rates increase defaults,
19:668:52223:17:17:73:537:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as more people are likely to lose jobs and become liquidity constrained during recessions.
19:669:52313:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Falling housing prices also raise defaults, because they increase the likelihood that a home-
19:670:52406:18:17:73:537:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:owner who receives a negative income shock will also have negative equity, and will thus
19:671:52494:17:17:73:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be unable to sell his home for enough to repay the mortgage. This interaction of income
19:672:52581:17:18:73:538:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shocks and falling prices is sometimes called the “double-trigger” model of default, because
19:673:52673:18:17:73:537:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it claims that defaults occur when two things happen at the same time: the borrower suffers
19:674:52764:17:18:73:429:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some adverse life event while he also has negative equity in his home.
19:675:52834:18:15:83:537:122:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:29For example, if both the default and prepayment hazards havebeen adjusted upwards by the implied
19:676:52932:15:12:73:538:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:assumptions on covariates and coefficient estimates, then the risk set will be whittled more quickly away by
19:677:53040:12:0:73:188:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:defaults and prepayments.

20:679:53133:21:25:110:149:656:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:faults
20:680:53139:25:17:91:538:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The previous subsection showed that high levels of origination DTI are not predictive
20:681:53224:17:18:73:537:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of high default rates, especially in comparison to variables like FICO scores and features
20:682:53314:18:17:73:538:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the macroeconomic environment like falling house pricesand rising unemployment. Our
20:683:53400:17:17:73:537:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:preferred interpretation of this pattern is that falling prices lead to negative equity, which
20:684:53494:17:18:73:537:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can lead to default and foreclosure when a borrower receivesa large negative income shock.
20:685:53584:18:17:73:538:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, as the model of section 2 shows, housing prices havea direct effect on the afford-
20:686:53675:17:17:73:538:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ability of a home that does not involve income volatility. A lower probability of future price
20:687:53769:17:18:73:538:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:appreciation (lowerαG) raises the user cost of owning a home and makes default more likely.
20:688:53860:18:17:73:538:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:If there is no hope that the price of the house will ever recover to exceed the outstanding
20:689:53951:17:17:73:537:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balance on the mortgage, the borrower may engage in “ruthless default” and simply walk
20:690:54037:17:18:73:538:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:away from the home. Kau, Keenan, and Kim (1994) show that optimal ruthless default
20:691:54119:18:17:73:538:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:takes place at a negative-equity threshold that is well below zero, due to the option value
20:692:54210:17:17:73:538:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of waiting to see whether the house price recovers.30Once the default threshold has been
20:693:54298:17:18:73:444:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reached, however, default remains optimal if no new information arrives.
20:694:54370:18:17:91:537:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Of course, we cannot observe the expectations of individualhomeowners to see whether
20:695:54454:17:17:73:538:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their defaults coincide with extremely gloomy forecasts offuture house prices. However, we
20:696:54544:17:18:73:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can exploit a particular feature of the ruthless default model to get a rough upper bound
20:697:54633:18:17:73:537:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on how many people are walking away from their homes. If the ruthless default model is
20:698:54719:17:17:73:537:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a good characterization of the data, then delinquent borrowers should simply stop making
20:699:54807:17:18:73:537:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:payments, never to resume again.  There is no reason for a ruthless defaulter to change
20:700:54894:18:17:73:538:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:his mind and start making payments once more (unless his expectation of future house
20:701:54978:17:17:73:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices suddenly improves). On the other hand, if income volatility is interacting with falling
20:702:55072:17:18:73:538:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:prices to produce double-trigger defaults, then we should see delinquent borrowers cycling
20:703:55162:18:17:73:538:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through various stages of delinquency as various shocks to their incomes are realized and
20:704:55251:17:18:73:538:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they struggle to keep their homes. In the LPS data, we observeeach borrower’s monthly
20:705:55336:18:17:73:538:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delinquency status so we can compare the number of “direct defaults” to the number of
20:706:55421:17:17:73:538:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:“protracted defaults.” The fraction of 90-day delinquencies that arise via direct defaults
20:707:55511:17:17:73:538:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:will be an upper bound on the importance of walk-away defaults, because some people
20:708:55594:17:18:73:538:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may have suffered particularly severe declines in income andhad to stop making payments
20:709:55681:18:17:73:360:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:abruptly, even though they wanted to keep their homes.
20:710:55735:17:18:91:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To set the stage for this analysis, we first present so-called“roll rates,” which measure the
20:711:55828:18:16:83:538:93:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:30The presence of this option value explains why negative equity is a necessary but not sufficient condition
20:712:55936:16:0:73:121:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for default.
21:713:55950:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood that a borrower in one stage of delinquency will transition into another. Figure 7
21:714:56043:17:17:73:537:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:graphs these rates for borrowers who start a month in different delinquency stages.31Panel
21:715:56133:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A considers people who begin a month in current status. SinceJanuary 2001, about 1 to
21:716:56218:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2 percent of current borrowers have become 30 days delinquent each month. Interestingly,
21:717:56306:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the number of people rolling from current to 30 days delinquent has only recently exceeded
21:718:56396:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the levels of the 2001 recession, even though foreclosures have been far higher than they
21:719:56485:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:were then. Another interesting pattern in this panel is thatthe current-to-30-day roll rate
21:720:56576:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was low in 2004 and 2005, when many supposedly unaffordable mortgages were originated.
21:721:56662:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Panel B considers borrowers who begin the month 30 days late.A fairly constant 40 percent
21:722:56751:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of these borrowers make their next payment to remain 30 days late the next month. Until
21:723:56838:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2007, about 40 percent of borrowers who were 30 days late madetwo payments to become
21:724:56922:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:current again, with the remaining 20 percent failing to makea payment at all and thereby
21:725:57010:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:becoming 60 days late. In the past few months, however, more persons who were 30 days
21:726:57095:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:late are rolling into 60-day status, considered the start ofserious delinquency. Panel C shows
21:727:57189:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the fraction of 60-day delinquencies that roll into 90-day status has risen sharply over
21:728:57282:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the past two years, with corresponding declines in the fractions of borrowers making two or
21:729:57373:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three payments. Yet the fraction of 60-day delinquencies making one payment to remain 60
21:730:57461:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:days late has remained fairly constant. Finally, Panel D analyzes borrowers who begin the
21:731:57550:18:17:73:537:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:month 90 days late. This is a somewhat absorbing state, because there is no formal 120-day
21:732:57640:17:17:73:107:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:status.
21:733:57647:17:18:91:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The main takeaway from Figure 7 is that many people who are delinquent have no
21:734:57725:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:desire to stay that way. Many people who are seriously delinquent come up with two or
21:735:57810:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three payments in an attempt to climb out of the status, or manage one payment so as not
21:736:57898:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to slide further down. Still, these graphs do not answer the precise question of how many
21:737:57987:18:17:73:537:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:people who become 90 days delinquent simply stopped making payments. We define this
21:738:58070:17:20:73:479:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:type of direct default as a 90-day delinquency that satisfiesthree requirements:
21:739:58150:20:18:91:538:224:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:A:•The borrower is current for three consecutive months, then registers a 30-day, a 60-day,
21:740:58239:18:20:73:431:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and a 90-day delinquency in succession during the next threemonths;
21:741:58306:20:20:91:511:186:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:A:•The borrower had never been seriously delinquent before this six-month stretch;
21:742:58386:20:17:91:538:166:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:A:•The borrower never becomes current or rolls down to 30-day or60-day status after
21:743:58467:17:21:73:134:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this stretch.
21:744:58480:21:17:91:538:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A of Table 6 lists the fraction of direct defaults for the entire United States,
21:745:58566:17:18:73:538:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:starting in 2003. These rates differ by the year that the mortgage is originated and the
21:746:58654:18:16:83:537:93:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:31As was the case with the duration models, the roll rates are based on a random 5 percent sample of the
21:747:58758:16:0:73:117:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:LPS data.
22:748:58769:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year in which the default occurred. Among all 2003–2008 mortgages that defaulted in 2008,
22:749:58858:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fewer than half, 41.6 percent, were direct defaults. This percentage was higher for loans
22:750:58947:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:made at the height of the housing boom, as 44.6 percent of 2005mortgages defaulting in
22:751:59033:17:18:73:537:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2008 were direct defaults. This is consistent with the idea that mortgages likely to have
22:752:59122:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the largest amounts of negative equity are the most likely toruthlessly default. But among
22:753:59212:17:18:73:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these mortgages, fewer than half simply stopped making payments, and even this fraction is
22:754:59302:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an upper bound on the true fraction of ruthless defaults.32Panel B Table 6 uses data from
22:755:59391:17:17:73:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:four states that have had particularly severe price declines and thus are more likely to have
22:756:59484:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ruthless defaulters.33As we would expect, the share of direct defaulters is higher in these
22:757:59575:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:states, reaching 55.1 percent in 2008. The 2008 fraction of direct defaults in the remaining
22:758:59667:17:17:73:415:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:47 states (including DC) is less than one-third, as seen in Panel C.
22:759:59735:17:18:91:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To sum up, falling house prices are no doubt causing some people to ruthlessly default.
22:760:59822:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:But the data indicate that ruthless defaults are not the biggest part of the foreclosure
22:761:59910:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:problem. For the nation as a whole, less than 40 percent of homeowners who had their first
22:762:60000:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:90-day delinquency in 2008 stopped making payments abruptly. Because this figure is an
22:763:60086:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:upper bound on the fraction of ruthless defaults, it suggests ruthless default is not the main
22:764:60180:17:44:73:409:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reason why falling house prices have caused so many foreclosures.
22:765:60245:44:29:73:360:356:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:4  Foreclosure and Renegotiation
22:766:60277:29:18:91:538:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A distressing feature of the ongoing foreclosure crisis is the seeming inability of the
22:767:60364:18:17:73:537:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:private market to stop it.  A lender typically suffers a large loss when it (or its agent)
22:768:60454:17:17:73:538:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forecloses on a house. On the surface, it would appear that the lender would be better off
22:769:60544:17:18:73:538:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifying any delinquent loan in the borrower’s favor and taking a small loss, as opposed
22:770:60633:18:17:73:537:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to refusing a modification, foreclosing on the mortgage, andsuffering a large loss. Lender
22:771:60723:17:17:73:537:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behavior is especially perplexing if high DTI ratios are causing the crisis. Surely making
22:772:60813:17:18:73:538:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage affordable by reducing a borrower’s DTI to 38 or 31 percent is preferable to
22:773:60902:18:17:73:538:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosure for the lender as well as the borrower. Given this apparent puzzle, a number of
22:774:60993:17:17:73:538:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysts have argued that the securitization of mortgages into trusts with diffuse ownership
22:775:61085:17:18:73:538:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is preventing “win-win” modifications from taking place.  Inthis section, we provide an
22:776:61172:18:17:73:537:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:alternative explanation for why modifications are rare. We then consult the LPS dataset

22:778:61344:18:15:83:537:118:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:32It is also important to point out that right-censoring may beinflating these numbers a little, since some
22:779:61451:15:12:73:538:103:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of the borrowers who we identify as direct defaulters in the last 3 months of the data, may make a mortgage
22:780:61558:12:9:73:172:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:payment in the future.

23:782:61640:0:25:73:337:677:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.1  The renegotiation-failure theory
23:783:61677:25:17:91:537:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Lenders often take large losses on foreclosed homes, which are typically sold for much less
23:784:61768:17:17:73:537:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than the outstanding balances of the defaulted mortgages. Conversely, the modifications
23:785:61855:17:18:73:538:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:offered to borrowers are generally modest. A study by White (2009) provides the following
23:786:61944:18:25:73:99:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data:
23:787:61949:25:17:102:509:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The average loss for the 21,000 first mortgages liquidated inNovember was
23:788:62022:17:18:102:508:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:$145,000, representing an average loss of 55 percent of the amount due. Losses on
23:789:62103:18:17:102:508:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:second lien mortgages were close to 100 percent. In comparison, for the modified
23:790:62183:17:17:102:509:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:loans with some amount of principal or interest written off, the average loss
23:791:62260:17:18:102:508:506:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:recognized was $23,610. This seven-to-one difference between foreclosure losses
23:792:62339:18:17:102:508:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and modification write-offs is striking, and lies at the heartof the failure of the
23:793:62422:17:17:102:509:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:voluntary mortgage modification program. Particularly forforeclosed loans with
23:794:62500:17:18:102:508:454:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:losses above the 57 percent average, some of which approach 100 percent, the
23:795:62576:18:17:102:508:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:decisions of servicers to foreclose is mystifying.... At a minimum, there is room
23:796:62657:17:17:102:509:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:for servicers to be more generous in writing down debt for theloans they are
23:797:62733:17:18:102:508:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:modifying, while still recovering far more than from foreclosures in the depressed
23:798:62815:18:25:102:270:384:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:real estate market of late 2008.34
23:799:62849:25:18:91:538:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To explain the small number of concessions and the large number of foreclosures, many
23:800:62934:18:17:73:538:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysts blame institutional factors related to the collection of mortgages into mortgage-
23:801:63024:17:17:73:538:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:backed securities (MBS). Such loans are owned by trusts on behalf of a large number of
23:802:63110:17:18:73:538:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual investors, rather than by a single entity (such as a local bank). White’s quote
23:803:63200:18:17:73:538:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mentions the decisions of loan servicers, who are responsible for funneling mortgage pay-
23:804:63289:17:17:73:538:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments to these MBS investors and performing various other tasks related to securitized
23:805:63375:17:18:73:537:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages.35Most importantly, when a borrower falls behind on his mortgage, it is the
23:806:63460:18:17:73:514:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servicer who decides whether a loan modification or a foreclosure is more appropriate.
23:807:63546:17:17:91:537:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Analysts who blame securitization for the low number of modifications argue that the
23:808:63630:17:18:73:537:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incentives of the servicers have become decoupled from those of investors, who ultimately
23:809:63719:18:17:73:537:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bear the losses entailed in foreclosure. We label this claimtherenegotiation-failure theory.
23:810:63811:17:17:73:537:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Securitization can potentially limit modifications in at least two ways. First, servicers can
23:811:63904:17:18:73:538:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be hamstrung by restrictive agreements they signed with investors at the origination of the
23:812:63995:18:17:73:538:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage trust, well before the crisis hit.36The actions of a servicer working for a trust are
23:813:64089:17:12:83:201:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:34White (2009), pp. 14–15.
23:814:64115:12:12:83:538:104:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:35Mortgages held in the portfolio of a single financial institution are normally serviced by that institution.
23:815:64225:12:15:83:538:92:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:36For example, the authors of the COP report write that “[r]estrictions on mortgage servicers’ ability to
23:816:64330:15:12:73:538:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:modify loans are an obstacle that has contributed to foreclosure that destroys value for homeowners and
23:817:64433:12:0:73:176:65:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:investors alike” (p. 50.)
24:818:64460:0:17:73:537:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:governed by so-called Pooling and Servicing Agreements (PSAs). Among other things, these
24:819:64548:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agreements specify the latitude that servicers have when deciding between modification and
24:820:64638:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosure. As a general rule, PSAs allow servicers to makemodifications, but only in cases
24:821:64730:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:where default is likely and where the benefit of a modificationover foreclosure can be shown
24:822:64822:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a net-present-value (NPV) calculation. Second, proponents of the renegotiation-failure
24:823:64913:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:theory claim that servicers are afraid that they will be suedby one tranche of investors
24:824:65001:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the MBS if they make modifications, even if these modifications benefit the investors in
24:825:65092:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the trust as a whole. Because different tranches of investorshave different claims to the
24:826:65181:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:payment streams from the MBS, a modification may alter these streams in a way that will
24:827:65268:18:17:73:537:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:benefit one tranche at the expense of another. One might thinkthat the PSAs would have
24:828:65354:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreseen this possibility, but some analysts claim that thePSAs were not written with an
24:829:65442:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:eye to the current foreclosure crisis. Thus, it is claimed that there is enough ambiguity in
24:830:65534:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the PSAs to make servicers wary of getting caught up in “tranche warfare,” so servicers are
24:831:65625:17:17:73:511:452:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:thought to follow the path of least resistance and forecloseon delinquent borrowers.37
24:832:65711:17:18:91:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A central implication of this theory is that securitizationand the related frictions em-
24:833:65799:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bedded in the contracts between investors and servicers arepreventing modifications that
24:834:65887:17:27:73:400:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would make even the lender better off. As Eggert (2007) states:
24:835:65950:27:17:102:509:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The complex webs that securitization weaves can be a trap andleave no one, not
24:836:66028:17:18:102:508:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:even those who own the loans, able effectively to save borrowers from foreclosure.
24:837:66110:18:17:102:508:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:With the loan sliced and tranched into so many separate interests, the different
24:838:66190:17:18:102:508:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:claimants with their antagonistic rights may find it difficultto provide borrowers
24:839:66272:18:38:102:504:303:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:with the necessary loan modifications, whether they want to or not (p. 292).38
24:840:66350:38:25:73:461:265:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.2  Reasons to doubt the renegotiation-failure theory
24:841:66404:25:17:91:537:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There are, however, reasons to doubt the renegotiation-failure theory. First, there is
24:842:66490:17:17:73:538:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:little evidence on the extent to which PSAs have limited modifications in practice.39A 2007
24:843:66581:17:18:73:538:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:study by Credit Suisse of approximately 30 PSAs concluded that fewer than 10 percent of
24:844:66668:18:17:73:538:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them completely ruled out modifications. About 40 percent ofthe PSAs allowed modifi-
24:845:66752:17:18:73:538:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cations, but with some restrictions. These restrictions included a limit on the percentage
24:846:66842:18:16:83:538:153:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:37The authors of the COP report write that “[s]ervicers may also be reluctant to engage in more active
24:847:66944:16:8:73:331:137:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:loan modification efforts because of litigation risk” (p. 46).
24:848:67006:8:16:83:538:129:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:38Other policy analysts have adopted a similar view. For example, the COP writes in its recent report
24:849:67107:16:11:73:538:113:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that “A series of impediments now block the negotiations that would bring together can-pay homeowners
24:850:67208:11:12:73:537:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:with investors who hold their mortgages .... Because of these impediments, foreclosures that injure both
24:851:67312:12:9:73:374:90:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the investor and homeowner continue to mount” (COP report, p. 2).
24:852:67377:9:15:83:538:81:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:39For a discussion of the role of PSAs in reducing modifications, see Cordell, Dynan, Lehnert, Liang, and
24:853:67482:15:0:73:451:66:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Mauskopf (2008), which also discusses the incentives facedby servicers more generally.
25:854:67570:0:17:73:537:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of mortgages in the pool that could be modified without permission from the trustee of
25:855:67656:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage-backed security (often 5 percent), and/or a floor for the mortgage rate that
25:856:67745:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:could be applied in the event of a modification that entailed areduction in the borrower’s
25:857:67835:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest rate. The remainder of PSAs contained no restrictions. It is unlikely that even
25:858:67923:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:PSAs with 5-percent caps are preventing modification to any significant degree. The Con-
25:859:68011:17:18:73:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset RecoveryProgram examined a number of
25:860:68097:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:securitized pools with 5-percent caps and found that none had yet approached this cap.40
25:861:68185:17:17:73:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, one can make a case that the typical PSA actuallycompelsthe servicer to make
25:862:68271:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications if these modifications are in the best interests of the investor. According to
25:863:68363:18:17:73:537:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Cordell, Dynan, Lehnert, Liang, and Mauskopf (2008), “While investors seem somewhat
25:864:68446:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concerned about servicer capacity, they do not convey widespread concern that servicers
25:865:68533:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are relying overmuch on foreclosures relative to modifications.” In fact, investors opposed
25:866:68624:18:24:73:271:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:additional incentives for modifications:
25:867:68664:24:18:102:509:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Investors with whom we spoke were not enthusiastic about an idea to reimburse
25:868:68741:18:17:102:509:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:servicers for expenses of loss mitigation.  In their view, such payments could
25:869:68819:17:17:102:508:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:lead to more modifications than warranted by the NPV calculations. They also
25:870:68895:17:18:102:509:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:felt that the PSA adequately specified that modifications that maximized NPV
25:871:68971:18:17:102:509:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:should be undertaken. A typical response from an investor was, Why should I
25:872:69046:17:25:102:448:358:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:pay servicers for doing something that I already paid them todo?41
25:873:69112:25:17:91:538:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Regarding the fear of lawsuits, no servicer has yet been suedfor making too many loan
25:874:69197:17:17:73:538:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications. There has been a well-publicized lawsuit filed by a group of investors against
25:875:69290:17:18:73:537:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a servicer doing modifications, but the details of this suit should not make other servicers
25:876:69382:18:17:73:538:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wary about making modifications.42Moreover, Hunt (2009) studied a number of subprime
25:877:69466:17:18:73:538:264:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitization contracts and found not only that outright bans on modifications were rare,
25:878:69556:18:17:73:538:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but also that most contracts allowing modifications essentially instructed the servicer to
25:879:69646:17:25:73:321:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:behave as if it were the single owner of the loan:
25:880:69696:25:17:102:508:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The most common rules [in making modifications] are that the servicer must

25:887:70206:12:12:73:538:101:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:struck with the government in a predatory lending case. The key argument by the investor in this lawsuit
25:888:70310:12:12:73:538:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:was that the modifications were done not because they were profitable for the investors, but rather to
25:889:70412:12:12:73:538:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:settle a predatory lending lawsuit, which the plaintiffs of that lawsuit claimed was the responsibility of
25:890:70518:12:0:73:369:65:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Countrywide, in its capacity as the originator of the troubled loans.
26:891:70589:0:17:102:509:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:service loans held for its own portfolio. Notably, these conditions taken together
26:892:70671:17:17:102:509:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:can be read as attempting to cause the loans to be serviced as if they had not
26:893:70749:17:22:102:308:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:been securitized. (p. 8, insertion added)
26:894:70790:22:18:91:538:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The Hunt (2009) findings speak directly to whether the modification of securitized mort-
26:895:70878:18:17:73:537:603:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gages is analogous to the restructuring of troubled corporations, as has been suggested by
26:896:70968:17:17:73:538:586:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some economists. As was illustrated in negotiations over the recent Chrysler bankruptcy, a
26:897:71058:17:18:73:538:569:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:single corporate bond holder can block a deal that is in the interests of all other stakeholders
26:898:71154:18:17:73:538:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the firm.43But any analogy between corporate bankruptcy and mortgage modification
26:899:71238:17:17:73:538:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is not appropriate. Not only can the typical mortgage servicer proceed with a modifica-
26:900:71325:17:18:73:538:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:tion without the approval ofallinvestors, the servicer does not need the approval ofany
26:901:71412:18:17:73:538:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investor to modify a loan. Thus, there is no possibility of a hold-up problem. The authors
26:902:71502:17:17:73:538:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the typical PSA appear to have anticipated the problems that could arise with dispersed
26:903:71592:17:18:73:538:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ownership, so the contract instructs the servicer to behaveas ifit alone owned the loan.
26:904:71680:18:17:73:538:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To preview our empirical results, we find that the data are consistent with the claim that
26:905:71770:17:26:73:344:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servicers are carefully following this type of contract.
26:906:71826:26:17:91:538:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:While there can be substantial disagreement about the importance of any particular
26:907:71908:17:17:73:538:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:institutional impediment to loan modification, perhaps themost compelling reason to be
26:908:71994:17:18:73:537:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:skeptical about the renegotiation-failure theory is the sheer size of the losses it implies. We
26:909:72089:18:17:73:537:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can use White’s figures quoted above to come up with a back-of-the-envelope calculation for
26:910:72180:17:18:73:538:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the total losses that follow from the renegotiation-failure theory. One figure often cited for
26:911:72274:18:17:73:537:317:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the total number of foreclosures that can be prevented with modifications is 1.5 million.44
26:912:72365:17:17:73:537:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For a dollar figure, we can multiply this number of preventable foreclosures by the $120,000
26:913:72457:17:17:73:538:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that White claims is lost by investors for each foreclosure performed.45This results in a
26:914:72546:17:18:73:260:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:total deadweight loss of $180 billion.
26:915:72584:18:17:91:537:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Losses of this size may be hard to square with economic theory, as Eric Maskin recently
26:916:72671:17:17:73:538:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pointed out in a letter to theNew York Times. Maskin wrote his letter in response to an
26:917:72758:17:18:73:538:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earlier op-ed that had claimed the government has a role in facilitating loan modifications,
26:918:72850:18:17:73:538:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specifically mass write-downs of principal balances.46According to Maskin: “If, as claimed,
26:919:72941:17:18:73:538:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:such write-downs are truly ‘win-win’ moves — allowing borrowers to keep their homes and
26:920:73028:18:17:73:538:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:giving mortgage holders a higher return than foreclosure — they may not need the govern-
26:921:73116:17:16:73:538:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ment’s assistance.” The writers of the original op-ed column had claimed that servicers now

26:923:73294:12:15:83:538:116:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:44This figure comes from FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair. For detailssee “Sheila Bair’s Mortgage Miracle,”

26:925:73432:9:12:83:149:92:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:45White (2008)
26:926:73446:12:15:83:538:80:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:46The op-ed to which Maskin responded is Geanakoplos and Koniak (2008). Maskin’s letter appeared on
26:927:73545:15:0:73:138:65:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:March 7, 2009.
27:928:73561:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have an undue incentive to foreclose rather than modify loans. Maskin pointed out that if
27:929:73650:17:27:73:194:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this were the case, then
27:930:73674:27:17:102:509:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:mortgage holders themselves have strong motivation to renegotiate those con-
27:931:73750:17:18:102:508:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:tracts, so that the servicers’ incentives are corrected. That would be a win-win-
27:932:73831:18:17:102:508:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:win move (for mortgage holders, servicers and borrowers), and to complete their
27:933:73910:17:27:102:384:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:argument, the writers must show why it won’t happen.
27:934:73962:27:18:91:538:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Economists will recognize the reasoning in Maskin’s critique. The Coase Theorem implies
27:935:74049:18:17:73:537:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that economically efficient decisions will be made as long as property rights are well-defined
27:936:74143:17:17:73:538:519:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and transactions costs are not of first-order importance. Under these conditions, it does
27:937:74232:17:18:73:538:502:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not matter that servicers are not the ones who suffer the $180 billion losses entailed in
27:938:74321:18:17:73:538:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreclosure, or even that existing PSAs might unduly limit modifications. The party that
27:939:74409:17:18:73:538:467:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suffers the potential losses — the investors — has an incentive to make side payments or
27:940:74497:18:17:73:537:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to change contractual arrangements so as to prevent these massive losses from occurring.
27:941:74585:17:17:73:538:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To take this reasoning one step further, if one class of investors has more to gain from
27:942:74673:17:17:73:538:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modification than another class stands to lose, the first class has an incentive to strike deals
27:943:74769:17:18:73:538:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with (or buy out) the second class. Consequently, to be consistent with the Coase Theorem,
27:944:74859:18:17:73:538:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the renegotiation-failure theory must also assert that thetransactions costs implied by
27:945:74946:17:17:73:537:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitization are large enough to derail these efficiency-enhancing arrangements, at the
27:946:75035:17:39:73:227:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cost to lenders of $180 billion.
27:947:75067:39:25:73:325:307:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4.3  A theory of loan modifications
27:948:75102:25:17:91:538:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There is another way to explain the low number of modifications that does not rely on
27:949:75187:17:17:73:538:265:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enormous transactions costs and yet is consistent with the Coase Theorem. It is simply
27:950:75273:17:18:73:538:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that most potential modifications are negative-NPV transactions from the standpoint of
27:951:75359:18:17:73:537:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:investors. In other words, when all the relevant costs and benefits are considered, servicers
27:952:75452:17:17:73:490:213:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:mayalreadybe acting in the best interests of the investors when they foreclose.47
27:953:75533:17:18:91:537:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To start with, modifications do not always prevent foreclosures, especially when defaults
27:954:75622:18:17:73:537:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are of the double-trigger variety. Consider a borrower who has lost his job. No permanent
27:955:75711:17:18:73:537:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modification can make the house affordable if the borrower hasno income. Lenders often
27:956:75797:18:17:73:538:143:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:offer “forbearance” in these cases, whereby the borrower pays sharply reduced payments
27:957:75883:17:17:73:538:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for a time. The borrower is then obligated to make up these arrears, with interest, later
27:958:75972:17:18:73:538:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on. Lenders may be reluctant to offer forbearance for any length of time if they are unsure
27:959:76063:18:16:83:537:91:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:47Note that because of externalities from foreclosures, modifications may be in society’s interests even if
27:960:76170:16:0:73:213:75:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:they are not investors’ interests.
28:961:76206:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when the borrower will find a new job (and at what wage). When the value of the house
28:962:76291:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that collateralizes the loan is falling, and when all parties know that the house has probably
28:963:76385:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:become unaffordable to the borrower, then the servicer may simply decide to take a loss
28:964:76472:17:18:73:443:626:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:now by foreclosing, rather than risk an even larger loss downthe road.48
28:965:76544:18:17:91:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The possibility that borrowers will re-default on their loans reduces thebenefitsof loan
28:966:76632:17:18:73:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications and thereby makes them less likely to occur. There are also reasons to think
28:967:76722:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thatcostsof modifications are higher than many housing analysts recognize. These analysts
28:968:76811:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:typically ignore the costs of modifications that are made to borrowers who would have
28:969:76896:17:18:73:537:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:repaid their loans anyway. Consider a lender facing a troubled borrower who is requesting
28:970:76985:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a modification. If the lender fails to modify the loan and the borrower defaults, the lender
28:971:77077:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:will lose because (as White points out above), the cost of modifying the loan falls far short
28:972:77170:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the cost of foreclosing. We will call this loss “Type I error.” However, Type I error is
28:973:77261:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only part of the story, as the lender faces another potentialproblem. If, unbeknownst to
28:974:77349:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the lender, the borrower requesting the modified loan will not default in the absence of a
28:975:77439:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modification, then the lender will lose the money he would have received according to the
28:976:77528:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:original terms of the loan. We call this situation “Type II error.” For a modification to
28:977:77617:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:make economic sense from the lender’s perspective, Type I error must exceed Type II error.
28:978:77707:17:18:91:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:More formally, we can follow Foote, Gerardi, and Willen (2008), who consider a lender
28:979:77792:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a borrower who owesmon a house currently worthpHdollars. This borrower will

29:1014:78992:17:17:73:537:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To understand this, consider some simple examples. If we setα0, the probability of default
29:1015:79082:17:32:73:391:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:without a modification, equal to 1, then equation (4) becomes

29:1017:79152:32:17:73:538:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is the case that White (2009) has in mind when he writes, “Particularly for foreclosed
29:1018:79243:17:17:73:537:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans with losses above the 57 percent average, some of whichapproach 100 percent, the
29:1019:79329:17:18:73:538:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decisions of servicers to foreclose is mystifying.”49In White’s extreme example of 100 percent
29:1020:79423:18:17:73:538:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loss given default, even a modification that reduces the probability of default from 1 to
29:1021:79512:17:17:73:537:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:anything even infinitesimally less than one, and in which thelender recovers infinitesimally
29:1022:79604:17:18:73:258:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than 0, makes economic sense.
29:1023:79638:18:17:91:538:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:However, even a little uncertainty about whether the borrower will default invalidates
29:1024:79724:17:17:73:538:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the above logic. If we assume modification ensures that the loan will repay with certainty
29:1025:79814:17:32:73:262:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(α1= 0), then equation (4) becomes:

29:1027:79871:32:17:73:538:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It is easy to see in this equation exactly how the math works against modification. Suppose
29:1028:79962:17:17:73:538:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the expected loss is 57 percent and the likelihood of defaultis 50 percent, then the lender
29:1029:80053:17:18:73:348:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can only reduce the value of the loan by 28.5 percent.

29:1032:80273:17:18:73:537:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to Type I error: even with major stresses, most homeowners will not default on
29:1033:80360:18:17:73:538:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their mortgages. The authors find that concessionary modifications make sense only for

29:1035:80504:17:18:91:538:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Equation (3) clearly illustrates that the observation thata foreclosure, on the surface,
29:1036:80592:18:17:73:537:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seems to lead to greater monetary losses than an apparently reasonable modification is not

30:1044:81129:25:17:91:538:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The LPS data allow us to perform an econometric test of the renegotiation-failure theory,
30:1045:81218:17:18:73:537:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:because these data contain information on the ultimate holder (investor) of the residential
30:1046:81309:18:17:73:537:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages. Specifically, we are able to tell whether a mortgage is held on the balance sheet
30:1047:81401:17:18:73:538:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a financial institution, securitized by a government sponsored enterprise (GSE) such as
30:1048:81491:18:17:73:537:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Freddie Mac (FHLMC) or Fannie Mae (FNMA), or securitized by anon-agency, private
30:1049:81571:17:17:73:538:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:institution. With this information, combined with information that allows us to identify
30:1050:81659:17:17:73:537:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modified loans, we are able to compare the relative modification frequency between loans
30:1051:81747:17:18:73:538:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:held in portfolio and loans that are securitized. If institutional constraints inherent in the
30:1052:81841:18:17:73:538:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitization process are preventing profitable modifications, then we expect to see in the
30:1053:81933:17:18:73:538:441:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data relatively few modifications among securitized loans,as compared with loans held in
30:1054:82021:18:17:73:120:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portfolio.
30:1055:82031:17:17:91:538:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The LPS dataset does not include direct information on loan modifications. However,
30:1056:82114:17:18:73:538:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it does contain updated loan terms at a monthly frequency, with which we are able to
30:1057:82198:18:17:73:537:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identify loan modifications indirectly (and imperfectly).50With these data we label a loan
30:1058:82288:17:17:73:538:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as modified if there is a change in its terms that was not stipulated by the initial terms of the
30:1059:82385:17:17:73:537:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contract. These changes include interest-rate reductions, principal-balance reductions, and
30:1060:82476:17:18:73:538:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:B:term extensions. We can also identify principal-balance and mortgage-paymentincreases
30:1061:82561:18:17:73:385:302:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:that reflect the addition of arrears to the balance of a loan.51
30:1062:82625:17:18:91:538:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 7 reports the number of modifications made by quarter from the first quarter of

30:1064:82796:17:17:73:538:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Each of the numbers in the table is a multiple of 10 because we used a 10 percent random
30:1065:82884:17:18:73:538:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sample and scaled up the numbers we found. The first column simply reports the total

30:1069:83269:11:12:73:537:176:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:large mortgage servicers that included the identification of loans in the LPS data that had been modified.

30:1071:83465:9:15:83:538:155:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:51There are two potential mistakes we can make in this exercise. First, we may falsely identify modifica-
30:1072:83570:15:12:73:537:140:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:tions (“false positives”) because of measurement error in the data (for example, a mistake in the updated
30:1073:83675:12:12:73:538:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:balance or interest rate) or some endogenous behavior on thepart of the borrower (for example, a borrower
30:1074:83780:12:12:73:538:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:making extra principal payments). Second, we may miss modifications (“false negatives”) because our al-
30:1075:83883:12:12:73:538:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:gorithm for finding modifications is incomplete. In this section we are more concerned with false positives
30:1076:83990:12:12:73:538:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:than with false negatives, so we use a conservative set of criteria. See Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009)
30:1077:84098:12:0:73:499:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for a detailed explanation of the exact algorithm used to identify modified loans in the LPS data.
31:1078:84198:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:number of loan modifications performed and shows that they have become more common
31:1079:84280:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as the housing market has weakened. By our calculations, there appear to be more than
31:1080:84365:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seven times as many modifications performed in the fourth quarter of 2008 as in the first
31:1081:84454:17:18:73:154:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quarter of 2007.
31:1082:84470:18:17:91:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to the rapid growth in loan modifications, the composition of modifications
31:1083:84557:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has changed over time. This can be seen in the remaining columns of Table 7, which list
31:1084:84644:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the incidence of modifications of different types.52A somewhat surprising finding is that
31:1085:84733:17:17:73:537:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most modifications entailedincreasesin the principal balance of a mortgage. Such increases
31:1086:84823:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are likely due to the addition of arrears to the outstanding mortgage balance for delinquent
31:1087:84915:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers, and they often increase the monthly mortgage payment by a nontrivial amount.
31:1088:85002:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table 7 shows that while the absolute numbers of balance-increasing modifications are still
31:1089:85093:17:18:73:537:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rising, they are falling as a percentage of total modifications. In the last few quarters in our
31:1090:85189:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data, interest-rate reductions, which necessarily involve a decrease in the mortgage payment,
31:1091:85282:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have become more frequent, rising to more than 25 percent of all modifications performed
31:1092:85370:17:18:73:537:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in 2008:Q4.  Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009) provide further information regarding
31:1093:85456:18:17:73:537:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the behavior of monthly mortgage payments for loans that have undergone a modification.
31:1094:85543:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The authors find that until the fourth quarter of 2008, modifications involving payment
31:1095:85630:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases were more common than those involving payment decreases. In addition, they find
31:1096:85719:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the average and median magnitudes of payment decreaseshave recently increased from
31:1097:85806:17:17:73:537:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approximately 10–14 percent in the period between 2007:Q1 and 2008:Q2, to approximately
31:1098:85893:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:20 percent in the final two quarters of 2008. Based on the logicfrom our simple framework
31:1099:85982:18:17:73:537:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above, it is likely that these will have more success than modifications involving increases
31:1100:86074:17:17:73:235:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the payment and/or balance.
31:1101:86104:17:18:91:537:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 8 contains some evidence from the LPS data to support this claim. The figure
31:1102:86187:18:17:73:537:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contains Kaplan-Meier non-parametric, survival estimates (also known as the product limit

31:1105:86453:18:15:83:537:209:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:52In many cases a mortgage will experience multiple types of modifications at the same time. For example,
31:1106:86558:15:12:73:538:194:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:we see cases in the data in which the interest rate is decreased and at the same time the term of the loan is
31:1107:86667:12:12:73:538:182:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:extended. Thus, the percentages in Table 7 are not calculated with respect to the number of loans modified,
31:1108:86774:12:9:73:364:170:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:but rather with respect to the number of modifications performed.
31:1109:86839:9:26:83:439:161:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:53The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function for delinquency is given by:

32:1119:87261:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The figure shows that modifications involving a decrease in the monthly payment are far
32:1120:87348:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more successful than those involving an increase in the payment. For example, after one
32:1121:87435:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year, the probability that a modified loan involving a payment increase becomes 90 days
32:1122:87522:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delinquent is approximately 69 percent. In contrast, a modified loan involving a payment
32:1123:87610:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decrease has a probability of becoming 90 days delinquent ofapproximately 52 percent.54Of
32:1124:87699:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:course, it should be noted that the underlying data in Figure8 come predominantly from
32:1125:87785:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loan modifications that took place in 2007 and early-to-mid 2008, while the majority of
32:1126:87872:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications in the LPS data occurred in the last two quarters of 2008. The Kaplan-Meier
32:1127:87961:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimator does account for right-censoring, but in order todraw more conclusive inferences
32:1128:88051:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we will need to observe more data on these recent modifications.  Another noteworthy
32:1129:88135:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observation from Table 7 is that the incidence of principal reductions is extremely low
32:1130:88222:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in our data.  This is likely due to two factors.  First, the LPS data under-represent the
32:1131:88311:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:subprime mortgage market.55A few servicers that focus almost exclusively on subprime
32:1132:88395:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:mortgages have recently begun modification programs that involve principal reduction.56
32:1133:88482:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In addition, from a theoretical perspective, principal reduction plans suffer from the severe
32:1134:88575:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incomplete-information problem noted earlier. Balance reductions are appealing to both
32:1135:88661:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers in danger of default and those who are not. As a result, lenders have a strong
32:1136:88749:17:18:73:538:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incentive to provide modifications only to those borrowers who are most likely to default.
32:1137:88839:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009) provide evidence to support this claim, as they show
32:1138:88927:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that modified loans in the LPS dataset are characterized by high leverage, high initial debt-
32:1139:89020:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to-income ratios, and low initial credit scores. These are the loans that are most likely to
32:1140:89112:18:17:73:400:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:default without a modification (that is, loans whereα0is high).
32:1141:89175:17:17:91:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 8 contains modification statistics broken down by the holder of the mortgage. We
32:1142:89261:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distinguish between mortgages held in portfolio, mortgages securitized by a GSE such as
32:1143:89348:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and mortgages securitized by a private entity. For each quarter
32:1144:89438:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of 2008, we calculate the percentage of loans outstanding atthe beginning of each quarter
32:1145:89527:17:18:73:537:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that were modified at some point in that quarter.  Each panel inthe table corresponds
32:1146:89612:18:17:73:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to a different sample of mortgages. Panel A corresponds to alltypes of mortgages in the
32:1147:89699:17:16:73:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data. Panel B corresponds to both subprime and Alt-A mortgages.57Finally, each panel in
32:1148:89786:16:16:83:538:176:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:54The pattern is similar if we assume the more stringent definition of default, corresponding to the
32:1149:89886:16:12:73:537:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:situation in which foreclosure proceedings are initiated by the holder of the mortgage. In this case, modified
32:1150:89996:12:12:73:538:148:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:loans involving a payment increase have a probability of experiencing a foreclosure of about 34 percent,
32:1151:90100:12:8:73:515:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:while modifications involving a payment decrease have an associated probability of about 17 percent.
32:1152:90200:8:15:83:538:128:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:55The majority of subprime mortgages are securitized by non-agency firms, and for the period of interest,
32:1153:90305:15:9:73:531:113:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the LPS dataset includes approximately 35 percent of mortgages securitized by non-agency corporations.
32:1154:90407:9:15:83:538:104:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:56An October report by Credit Suisse notes that Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC and Litton Loan Servic-
32:1155:90504:15:12:73:538:89:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:ing LP were the only subprime servicers that had performed a nontrivial number of principal reduction
32:1156:90605:12:9:73:384:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:modifications. Neither of these servicers contribute to theLPS dataset.
32:1157:90676:9:0:83:538:68:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:57The definition of subprime and Alt-A comes directly from the servicers that contribute to the LPS
33:1158:90777:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the table is disaggregated into three parts, correspondingto different denominators used in
33:1159:90868:17:17:73:537:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:calculating the percentages. The first part uses all loans outstanding at the beginning of the
33:1160:90962:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:respective quarter, the second part uses all loans that are 30 days delinquent at the start of
33:1161:91056:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the respective quarter, and the third part uses all loans that are 60 days delinquent at the
33:1162:91148:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:start of the respective quarter. By limiting the sample to delinquent loans, we are partially
33:1163:91241:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:controlling for differences in credit quality between loansheld in portfolio and loans that are
33:1164:91336:18:17:73:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitized. This control turns out to be important. In bothof the panels, and in almost all
33:1165:91428:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:quarters, modifications for privately securitized loans are more frequent than for portfolio
33:1166:91520:17:18:73:537:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans when the relevant universe is the full sample of loans.However, privately securitized
33:1167:91611:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans are generally riskier than other loans, so this discrepancy may simply reflect the fact
33:1168:91704:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that more privately securitized loans are in danger of foreclosure and are thus, candidates
33:1169:91795:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for modification. When we narrow the focus todelinquentloans, the results become more
33:1170:91880:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:balanced. Portfolio loans have a slightly higher incidenceof modification compared with
33:1171:91967:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:privately securitized in Panel A, while modifications are more common among portfolio
33:1172:92052:17:18:73:453:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans in many instances in Panel B (except in the fourth quarter of 2008).
33:1173:92126:18:17:91:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There are at least two patterns of note in Table 8. First, while delinquent loans held
33:1174:92212:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in portfolio appear to be modified more frequently than privately securitized mortgages
33:1175:92299:17:18:73:537:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(except for subprime and Alt-A mortgages, as defined in the LPS data), the discrepancy
33:1176:92385:18:17:73:538:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is not as large as it is often made out to be in policy circles and in media reports. For
33:1177:92474:17:17:73:537:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sample of all 30-day delinquent loans (Panel A) held in portfolio, 6.81 percent were
33:1178:92562:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modified in the third quarter of 2008 and 8.55 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. In
33:1179:92650:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comparison, 6.28 percent and 6.23 percent of privately securitized mortgages were modified
33:1180:92740:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008, respectively.  We see similar, although
33:1181:92828:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:slightly larger discrepancies for 60-day delinquent loans, but in many instances the sign
33:1182:92917:18:17:73:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes for subprime and Alt-A loans (Panel B). The second take-away from the table
33:1183:93000:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is that the GSEs appear to have been much more reluctant to modify loans, with the
33:1184:93082:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exception of Freddie Mac in the third and fourth quarters of 2008.  While the summary
33:1185:93167:18:17:73:537:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:statistics presented above suggest that the incidence of modification does not seem to be
33:1186:93256:17:17:73:538:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:greatly impeded by the process of securitization, there area variety of factors that could be
33:1187:93349:17:18:73:537:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contributing to the variation in Table 8, including substantial differences in characteristics
33:1188:93443:18:17:73:538:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between portfolio-held loans and securitized loans. In addition, there may be significant lags
33:1189:93537:17:17:73:538:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the time when a loan becomes delinquent and the pointwhen it is modified that are
33:1190:93626:17:18:73:538:123:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not captured in Table 8. For example, if it were the case that the percentages of modified
33:1191:93716:18:17:73:537:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans were the same, but portfolio-held loans were modified more quickly than privately
33:1192:93803:17:22:73:538:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:securitized loans, Table 8 would show more portfolio-held loans being modified (since the
33:1193:93892:22:0:73:476:66:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:dataset. There is no additional distinction between subprime and Alt-A in the LPS dataset.
34:1194:93984:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:slower, privately securitized modifications would not be picked up in the table). For this
34:1195:94074:17:17:73:537:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reason, a slightly more formal analysis is necessary, in which other observable differences
34:1196:94165:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between securitized and portfolio loans are controlled for, and in which the timing issues
34:1197:94255:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as well as right-censoring are also taken into account. Censoring is an especially important
34:1198:94347:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:problem, as there are currently many delinquent loans outstanding that are, or will soon
34:1199:94435:17:18:73:489:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be, good candidates for modification, as the housing market continues to decline.
34:1200:94516:18:17:91:537:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 9 displays Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function with respect to the
34:1201:94601:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transition from delinquency to modification, broken down bythe holder of the mortgage.
34:1202:94687:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:While the Kaplan-Meier estimator does not control for otherobservable differences in mort-

34:1204:94868:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The figure contains two plots.  The first plot displays estimates of the survival function
34:1205:94958:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding to the transition from 30 days delinquency (one mortgage payment behind)
34:1206:95044:18:17:73:537:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to modification of all mortgages originated after 2004 in theLPS dataset, while the second
34:1207:95134:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plot uses only data from subprime/Alt-A mortgages in the LPSdata originated after 2004.
34:1208:95221:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:There are a few notable patterns contained in Figure 9. First, looking at the universe of
34:1209:95310:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all mortgages, privately securitized loans and GNMA loans aremorelikely to have been
34:1210:95394:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modified than loans held in portfolio and FNMA loans over a fairly long horizon. Condi-

34:1212:95570:18:17:73:537:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:being modified after two years, and a 26 percent probability after three years, compared
34:1213:95658:17:17:73:538:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with 11 percent and 16 percent for loans held in portfolio, respectively.59Over a shorter
34:1214:95747:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:horizon, (less than one year), there is very little difference across different types of loans
34:1215:95841:18:17:73:538:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when conditioning on 30-day delinquency. The patterns are slightly different for the sam-
34:1216:95930:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ple of subprime/Alt-A loans, as the incidence of modification is virtually the same over all
34:1217:96022:17:18:73:377:279:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:horizons for portfolio-held and privately securitized loans.60
34:1218:96084:18:17:91:538:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Before concluding our analysis of loan modifications, we take note of some other papers
34:1219:96171:17:17:73:538:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that have examined the issue with the same data.  Piskorski, Seru, and Vig (2009) find
34:1220:96257:17:18:73:538:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that seriously delinquent portfolio loans in the LPS data are less likely to experience a
34:1221:96346:18:17:73:538:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:completed foreclosure than seriously delinquent securitized loans.  The authors attribute
34:1222:96435:17:16:83:538:192:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:58Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009) estimate Cox proportional hazard models of the transition from
34:1223:96535:16:12:73:538:176:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:delinquency to modification, in which differences in observable loan and borrower characteristics are con-
34:1224:96641:12:8:73:360:164:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:trolled for, and find results that support the patterns in Figure 9.
34:1225:96709:8:16:83:538:156:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:59These probabilities increase substantially for loans thatbecome 60 days delinquent, but the relative
34:1226:96811:16:12:73:537:140:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:patterns are similar.  Conditional on 60-day delinquency, aprivately securitized loan has a 27 percent
34:1227:96913:12:12:73:538:128:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:probability of being modified after two years, and a 40 percent probability after three years, compared with
34:1228:97021:12:12:73:538:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:23 percent and 32 percent for loans held in portfolio, respectively. See Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2009)
34:1229:97129:12:8:73:138:104:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for these plots.
34:1230:97145:8:16:83:538:96:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:60There are a trivial number of GNMA subprime loans in the data,and thus we drop GNMA from the
34:1231:97239:16:12:73:538:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:graph. In addition, there are only a small number of FNMA and FHLMC subprime loans that are seasoned
34:1232:97339:12:0:73:515:68:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:beyond two years, and thus we decided to truncate the graph for these types of loans after two years.
35:1233:97442:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this finding to a greater willingness of portfolio lenders tomodify loans, but a careful
35:1234:97530:17:17:73:537:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analysis of the data does not support this inference. First,as we seen, portfolio lenders
35:1235:97619:17:17:73:537:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are not more likely to modify mortgages.61Portfolio lenders might be making “better”
35:1236:97703:17:18:73:537:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications than servicers of securitized loans, which could in theory explain the smaller
35:1237:97795:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:number of foreclosures among delinquent portfolio loans. However, Adelino, Gerardi, and
35:1238:97882:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Willen (2009) show that the sheer number of modifications among all types of seriously
35:1239:97968:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:delinquent loans (about 7 percent) is far too low for differences in modification quality to
35:1240:98060:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explain Piskorski et al.’s findings.  A second issue stems from Piskorski et al.’s use of a
35:1241:98151:17:18:73:538:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:completed foreclosure as the relevant loan outcome. If portfolio lenders were truly more
35:1242:98239:18:17:73:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:willing to modify, as Piskorski et al.  claim, then we would expect not only fewer bad
35:1243:98325:17:17:73:537:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:outcomes among portfolio loans (that is, fewer foreclosures), but also more good outcomes
35:1244:98414:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(for example, more transitions to current status or to prepayment).  After all, servicers
35:1245:98503:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:immediately classify modified loans as current. But Adelinoet al. also show that delinquent
35:1246:98594:17:17:73:537:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portfolio loans are no more likely to transition to current or prepaid status than securitized
35:1247:98688:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans.62All told, the likely explanation for the Piskorski et al. finding of fewer foreclosures
35:1248:98783:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among delinquent portolio loans is not a higher willingnessof portfolio lenders to modify
35:1249:98872:17:17:73:538:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:loans, but rather various accounting and regulatory issuesthat make portfolio servicers less
35:1250:98964:17:39:73:293:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:willing to complete the foreclosure process.

35:1252:99054:24:18:91:538:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In addition to comparing securitized vs. non-securitized loans today, we can evaluate
35:1253:99139:18:17:73:538:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:claims about contract-related frictions by looking at the historical record. It is often claimed
35:1254:99235:17:18:73:538:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that renegotiation was frequent in the past, before securitized mortgages were common. For
35:1255:99325:18:17:73:538:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:example, a report from the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Recovery
35:1256:99413:17:27:73:176:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Program states that
35:1257:99432:27:17:102:509:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For decades, lenders in this circumstance could negotiate with can-pay borrowers
35:1258:99512:17:18:102:508:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:to maximize the value of the loan for the lender (100 percent of the market value)
35:1259:99594:18:17:102:509:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:and for the homeowner (a sustainable mortgage that lets the family stay in the
35:1260:99672:17:17:102:508:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:home). Because the lender held the mortgage and bore all the loss if the family
35:1261:99751:17:18:102:509:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:couldn’t pay, it had every incentive to work something out ifa repayment was
35:1262:99827:18:12:83:445:136:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:61The Piskorski et al. paper never tries to identify modifications directly, as we do.
35:1263:99913:12:16:83:538:124:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:62This finding may seem inconsistent with the reduced likelihood of completed foreclosures among portfolio
35:1264:100019:16:12:73:538:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:loans. But a complicating fact is that most of the loan data isright-censored. The difference in completed
35:1265:100125:12:12:73:538:96:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:foreclosures is offset by an increased number of loans that are more than 90 days delinquent or in some
35:1266:100228:12:0:73:280:84:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:stage of foreclosure when the data is truncated.

36:1268:100289:27:17:73:538:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Other authors, including Zingales (2008) and Geanakoplos and Koniak (2008), have also
36:1269:100374:17:17:73:538:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:claimed that renegotiation used to be common, but we know of no historical studies that
36:1270:100461:17:18:73:537:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:verify this claim. There are, however, reasons to be skeptical. First, foreclosures were quite
36:1271:100555:18:17:73:537:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common in the past. Between 1929 and 1936, lenders carried out 1.8 million foreclosures
36:1272:100642:17:18:73:538:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the United States. To put that number in perspective, keepin mind that the number
36:1273:100726:18:17:73:538:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of occupied dwellings more than quadrupled from 22.9 million in 1930 to 105 million in
36:1274:100812:17:17:73:538:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:2000.64In addition, increases in credit and increases in owner-occupancy have resulted
36:1275:100898:17:17:73:538:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the number of owner-occupied, mortgaged homes rising from 4.8 million in 1940 to 39
36:1276:100984:17:18:73:538:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:million in 2000. Thus, an equivalent figure for the current crisis would be between 8.3 and
36:1277:101075:18:17:73:190:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:17 million foreclosures.

36:1280:101272:17:17:73:538:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:10 shows the fraction of loans foreclosed upon by year of origination for the three prin-
36:1281:101361:17:18:73:537:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cipal sources of credit in that period: savings and loan institutions (S&L), life insurance
36:1282:101452:18:17:73:537:407:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:companies, and commercial banks. The worst vintages were those of the late 1920s, when
36:1283:101538:17:17:73:537:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:approximately 30 percent of loans originated by life insurance companies ended in foreclo-
36:1284:101628:17:17:73:538:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sure, 20 percent of S&L mortgages ended in foreclosure, and about 15 percent of commercial
36:1285:101718:17:18:73:538:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bank loans were foreclosed upon. The bottom panel shows the fraction of homeownerships
36:1286:101804:18:17:73:538:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(not loans) originated each year in Massachusetts from 1988through 2008 that eventually
36:1287:101891:17:18:73:538:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ended in foreclosure.65Since at least some of these foreclosures did not occur on purchase
36:1288:101981:18:17:73:538:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages, but rather on subsequent refinances, one can viewthis as an upper bound on a
36:1289:102068:17:17:73:538:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similar measure using current data. What is clear is that we see farfewerforeclosures than
36:1290:102158:17:18:73:538:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we did in the 1930s. These statistics are difficult to square with the claim that renegotiation
36:1291:102253:18:17:73:230:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was more common in the past.
36:1292:102281:17:17:91:538:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In fact, historical documents do suggest that modificationsoccurred in the past. The

36:1294:102445:17:18:73:538:200:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the midst of the Great Depression, would buy loans at a deep discount from lenders and
36:1295:102531:18:17:73:538:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:re-underwrite the borrower into a new mortgage consistent with the borrower’s financial
36:1296:102618:17:18:73:538:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:situation at the time. However, it is important to understand that the economic situation
36:1297:102707:18:17:73:538:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was extremely poor, as 40 percent of American homeowners were more than 15 months in
36:1298:102791:17:18:73:537:130:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:arrears. In terms of our model, this made Type I error large and Type II error small.66

37:1306:103315:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1952) shows that as many as 40 percent of the loans originated in a given year would
37:1307:103400:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be modified at least once, and as many as half of those more thanonce. However, it is
37:1308:103485:17:18:73:538:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important to understand that until the 1930s, commercial banks could not make long-term
37:1309:103572:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:amortized loans, so renegotiation for term extensions and interest rate changes was common.
37:1310:103663:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:According to Behrens, “It should also be observed that the low level of interest rates current

37:1317:104270:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recommends turning the problem over to an attorney.67The author then discusses how to
37:1318:104355:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deal with the sale of a foreclosed property but never suggests that the servicer should make
37:1319:104447:17:17:73:537:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concessions to help the borrower continue making payments.Even HOLC, to a large extent,

37:1321:104622:18:17:73:238:365:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the borrowers to whom it lent.68
37:1322:104654:17:17:91:537:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Foreclosure has always been a common outcome in mortgage lending, even for the best-
37:1323:104738:17:18:73:538:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intentioned of lenders. The first borrower ever to obtain a loan from a Building and Loan

37:1325:104913:17:17:73:538:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out a mortgage on April 11, 1831, but “was frequently fined forfailure to pay his dues and
37:1326:105003:17:18:73:538:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interest.” The problems were resolved in what amounts to a foreclosure: both the house and
37:1327:105093:18:44:73:345:261:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the mortgage were transferred to another borrower.69
37:1328:105145:44:29:73:195:217:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5  Conclusion
37:1329:105158:29:17:91:537:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we have attempted to make two main points. First, while the concept
37:1330:105240:17:18:73:537:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of mortgage “affordability” is often used in explanations ofthe current rise in mortgage
37:1331:105328:18:17:73:537:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:defaults, this concept is not helpful if it is not defined precisely.  Many people believe
37:1332:105418:17:17:73:538:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the affordability of a mortgage is adequately summarized in the DTI at origination.
37:1333:105506:17:18:73:538:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, this ratio does not appear to be a strong predictor of default. What really matters
37:1334:105598:18:12:83:224:101:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:A:67Pease and Cherrington (1953).

38:1337:105680:0:17:73:538:677:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the default decision is the mortgage payment relative to the borrower’s income in the
38:1338:105768:17:17:73:538:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:present and future, not the borrower’s income in the past. Consequently, the high degree
38:1339:105856:17:17:73:538:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of volatility in individual incomes means that mortgages that start out with low DTIs can
38:1340:105945:17:18:73:538:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:end in default if housing prices are falling. A second, related point concerns the apparent
38:1341:106036:18:17:73:538:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unwillingness of loan servicers to turn “bad” (that is, high-DTI) mortgages into “good”
38:1342:106123:17:18:73:537:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(low-DTI) mortgages.  It is true that lenders may lose a greatdeal of money with each
38:1343:106208:18:17:73:538:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual foreclosure, but the loan modifications might have negative NPV if they are
38:1344:106294:17:17:73:538:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sometimes extended to people who are likely to pay on time anyway. And the benefits of
38:1345:106380:17:18:73:382:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:modifications are uncertain if borrowers have lost their jobs.
38:1346:106442:18:17:91:538:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:What do these findings suggest for foreclosure-reduction policy? One suggestion would
38:1347:106527:17:17:73:538:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be to focus a program on the effects of income volatility, helping people who lose their
38:1348:106615:17:18:73:538:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:jobs get through difficult periods without having to leave their homes. For example, the
38:1349:106703:18:17:73:538:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:government could replace a portion of lost income for a period of one or two years, through a
38:1350:106796:17:17:73:538:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:program of loans or grants to individual homeowners.70For more permanent and very large
38:1351:106883:17:18:73:538:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:setbacks, the government could help homeowners transitionto rentership through short sales
38:1352:106973:18:17:73:538:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or other procedures. Whatever policies are adopted, the results of this paper suggest that
38:1353:107063:17:17:73:537:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policies that encourage moderate, long-term reductions inDTIs face important hurdles in
38:1354:107150:17:315:73:278:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:addressing the current foreclosure crisis.

54:1653:120940:22:12:73:538:652:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:The top panel reports foreclosures on loans originated in that year. Loans may be purchase or refinance.
54:1654:121044:12:12:73:538:640:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Data comes from Morton (1956). The bottom panel reports foreclosures on homes purchased with mortgages
54:1655:121146:12:12:73:538:628:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in that year. For these data, we count a loan as foreclosed if there was a foreclosure on that loan or any
54:1656:121252:12:12:73:537:616:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:subsequent mortgage to that owner. Thus the probabilities in the lower panel are an upper bound on the
54:1657:121354:12:22:73:432:604:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:probabilities in the top panel. See Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen (2007) for details.
