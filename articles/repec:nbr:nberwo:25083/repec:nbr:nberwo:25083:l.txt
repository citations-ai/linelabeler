2:37:2230:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Can  macroprudential  foreign  exchange  (FX)  regulations  on  banks  reduce  the  financial  and 
2:38:2329:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:macroeconomic vulnerabilities  created  by  borrowing  in  foreign  currency?  To  evaluate  the 
2:39:2425:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:effectiveness  and  unintended consequences  of  macroprudential  FX  regulations,  we  develop  a 
2:40:2523:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:parsimonious model of bank and market lending in domestic and foreign currency and derive four 
2:41:2617:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:predictions. We confirm these predictions using a rich dataset of macroprudential FX regulations. 
2:42:2714:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:These empirical tests show that FX regulations:(1) are effective in terms of reducing borrowing in 
2:43:2812:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:foreign currency by banks; (2) have the unintended consequence of simultaneously causing firms 
2:44:2906:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:to increase FX debt issuance; (3) reduce the sensitivity of banks to exchange rate movements, but 
2:45:3003:14:14:72:542:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:(4) are less effective at reducing the sensitivity of corporates and the broader financial market to
2:46:3102:14:14:72:542:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:exchange  rate  movements.  As  a  result,  FX  regulations  on  banks appear  to  be  successful  in
2:47:3202:14:14:72:543:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:mitigating the vulnerability of banks to exchange rate movements and the global financial cycle,
2:48:3297:14:28:72:399:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:but partially shift the snowbank of FX vulnerability to other sectors.

3:74:3828:0:30:102:196:706:122:Georgia:122:Georgia:A:I. Introduction 
3:75:3842:30:19:102:528:676:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The  global  financial  crisis  has  prompted  renewed  interest  in  tools  to  reduce 
3:76:3930:19:19:75:528:657:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroeconomic and  financial vulnerabilities,  strengthen  financial  systems,  and  improve 
3:77:4023:19:19:75:528:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:country resilience. A key component of this   strategy is greater use of macroprudential tools — 
3:78:4120:19:18:75:528:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:such as countercyclical capital buffers, tighter reserve ratios, leverage ratios, and restrictions 
3:79:4219:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:on  loan-to-value  and  debt-to-income  ratios.  Several  papers  have  analyzed  the  use  and 
3:80:4315:19:19:75:548:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:effectiveness of many of these tools.1 One    type of tool, macroprudential foreign exchange (FX) 
3:81:4412:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations, however,  has    received  less  attention,  despite  the  long-standing  research 
3:82:4508:19:30:75:412:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:documenting the vulnerabilities associated with currency mismatch.  
3:83:4575:30:19:102:528:514:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This paper seeks to fill this gap. It   provides a detailed assessment of macroprudential 
3:84:4665:19:19:75:528:495:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations on the use of foreign currencies by banks, including theoretical predictions of how 
3:85:4761:19:19:75:528:476:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:they could work and then empirical assessments of their direct and unintended consequences 
3:86:4852:19:18:75:528:457:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:using  a  rich  new  dataset.  We  find that    macroprudential  FX policies  are  effective  in 
3:87:4949:18:19:75:528:439:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:accomplishing their primary goal of reducing bank exposure to for eign currency risk. But do 
3:88:5042:19:19:75:528:420:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:they simply shift the risk elsewhere—similar to “shifting a snowbank” (a pile of snow) from 
3:89:5134:19:19:75:528:401:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:one place to another? We find some evidence of a “shifting snowbank” effect, as reduced FX 
3:90:5225:19:18:75:528:382:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:lending from banks causes some firms to  increase  FX debt issuance to investors. This shifting 
3:91:5321:18:19:75:528:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:is only partial, however, so that aggregate exposure to FX debt    declines. Our results also show 
3:92:5420:19:19:75:544:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that these FX  regulations reduce the sensitivity of banks to currency movements, but   are less 
3:93:5517:19:19:75:527:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:successful at reducing the sensitivity of the corporate sector and the   broader economy. As a 
3:94:5612:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:result, although macroprudential FX regulations can    substantially improve the resilience of 
3:95:5707:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the banking sector to the global financial cycle  , the benefits to the broader economy may be 
3:96:5802:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:more moderate,  as some vulnerability shifts to other sectors that    may be less informed and 
3:97:5897:19:31:75:248:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:make less efficient lending choices. 
3:98:5934:31:18:102:528:220:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Exposure to foreign currency borrowing and currency mismatch has  been a habitual 
3:99:6016:18:19:75:530:202:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:concern, especially in emerging markets. Foreign currency exposure can increase a country’s  
3:100:6109:19:19:75:528:183:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:vulnerability to sudden stops, currency depreciations, and financial and banking crises, as well 
3:101:6206:19:19:75:528:164:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:as  limit    the ability of the exchange rate and monetary policy to respond to shocks (Rey, 2013). 
3:102:6306:19:18:75:528:145:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Despite these concerns, foreign currency exposure has continued to increase—especially in 
3:103:6396:18:32:75:525:127:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the corporate and household sector.2 For example, over our sample period from the mid-

4:108:6838:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:more than tripled to about $12 trillion USD. FX borrowing has continued to grow since the 
4:109:6928:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:2008 crisis   —with    cross   -border FX borrowing in international debt securities and FX loans 
4:110:7026:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increasing by  around $ 2.5   trillion USD    between 2009 and 2015—a sharp contrast to almost 
4:111:7121:19:18:75:529:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:no change in comparable cross-border borrowing in local currency over the same period. 
4:112:7208:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Concerns about the macroeconomic and financial risks related to FX exposure have increased 
4:113:7299:19:31:75:321:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:interest in using macroprudential FX regulations.

4:115:7436:19:18:75:529:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:partly due to insufficient data   linked to the limited experience with these tools until recently, 
4:116:7536:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and  partly  due  to  identification  challenges  related  to  macroprudential regulations  being

4:118:7729:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:should assess not only the direct effects of these measures on the intended sector of the 
4:119:7819:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:economy (such as banks), but also any spillovers or leakages as firms, banks, and    other    entities 
4:120:7921:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:respond to the regulations. These types of unintended consequences have been highlighted in

4:126:8449:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:parsimonious  model  of  bank  versus  market  lending,  building  on  the  seminal work  of 
4:127:8542:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), but adding the dimension that lending and borrowing is also 
4:128:8631:18:19:75:532:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:differentiated  between domestic and foreign currencies . Domestic firms seek funding from 
4:129:8722:19:19:75:531:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:lenders,  but have private information about their productivity. Banks can screen firms at a 
4:130:8815:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:cost and identify unproductive, low-productivity, and high-productivity firms, while market 
4:131:8907:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:investors can  only  lend  indiscriminately.  Funding  in  foreign  currency  is  cheaper than  in 
4:132:9006:18:19:75:529:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:domestic currency,  but subject to exchange rate risk. When the domestic currency depreciates, 
4:133:9101:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:low -productivity firms and their associated banks default. Macroprudential FX regulation 
4:134:9191:19:19:76:528:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increases  banks’  cost  of  funding  in  foreign  currency  (if the  regulation  is  a liability-side 
4:135:9294:19:32:76:528:157:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:measure) or the equilibrium lending rate to firms (if an asset-side measure). Banks stop

5:143:10055:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing from banks to investors.  Total factor productivity declines, as FX   lending shifts to 
5:144:10153:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:investors (who    cannot screen) and a share of FX  lending shifts to less productive firms. The 
5:145:10250:19:19:75:531:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:overall  impact  on  welfare  is  ambiguous and  reflects  a tradeoff  between  two  forces:  FX 
5:146:10347:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulation provides the benefit of reducing the social cost of bank failure after depreciations 
5:147:10443:18:31:75:459:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:at  the cost of reducing output due to the less efficient allocation of FX lending.  
5:148:10528:31:19:102:538:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Our simple framework yields four  testable implications for how macroprudential FX 
5:149:10611:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations affect bank and corporate borrowing, cross-border capital flows, FX exposure in 
5:150:10703:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:different  sectors  of  the  economy,  and  macroeconomic  vulnerability  to  exchange  rate 
5:151:10796:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:move   ments. After an increase in macroprudential FX regulations: (1) banks borrow and lend 
5:152:10889:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:less in foreign currency ( with no change in their borrowing in local currency); (2) firms shift 
5:153:10986:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:away from bank borrowing and increase  their FX borrowing from market investors (with no 
5:154:11075:19:18:76:532:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:in crease in firm and bank non-FX borrowing from investors);  (3) banks are less exposed to 
5:155:11167:18:19:76:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exchange rate movements; and (4) firms experience some reduction in their exposure to 
5:156:11253:19:31:76:323:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exchange rate movements, but less than for banks. 
5:157:11303:31:19:103:528:401:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To  test  these four    predictions, we  build  a rich  data  set  on  macroprudential  FX 
5:158:11394:19:18:75:528:382:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations,  defined  as  policies  directed  at  the  broader  financial  system  (compared  to 
5:159:11492:18:19:75:538:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:prudential regulations that target individual institutions) and that are  based on the currency 
5:160:11588:19:19:76:536:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:denomination  of  the  capital  transaction. The    dataset is  based  on  four  sources  that  each 
5:161:11689:19:19:76:529:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:document and measure macroprudential FX regulations in different contexts or for different 
5:162:11780:19:18:76:529:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:countries: Shim et al. (2013  ),  Vandenbussche et al. (2015  ),  Cerutti et al. (2017) and    Reinhardt 
5:163:11884:18:19:76:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and  Sowerbutts (2018) .  Our   resulting data  set includes  information  on  macroprudential 
5:164:11979:19:19:76:574:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations in 48 countries over the  period 1995  -2014. It    has    broader country and period 
5:165:12077:19:19:76:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:coverage of macroprudential FX regulations, as well as a  more detailed categorization of 
5:166:12167:19:30:76:351:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:different types of regulations, than previously available.  
5:167:12226:30:19:103:528:202:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The empirical analysis confirms the four testable implications of the model, as well as 
5:168:12314:19:19:76:528:183:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:provides additional details on how tighter macroprudential FX regulations affect (or do not 
5:169:12406:19:19:76:528:164:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:affect)  different  types  of  cross-border  capital  flows,  banks,  and  sensitivity  to  currency 
5:170:12507:19:18:76:528:145:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:movements. These  results  suggest  that  macroprudential FX  regulations  on  banks are 
5:171:12595:18:19:75:528:127:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:successful in accomplishing their direct goals —    of reducing the FX exposure of banks and 
5:172:12687:19:19:75:528:108:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:sensitivity of banks to currency movements. There is also some evidence that this occurs 
5:173:12776:19:0:75:528:89:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:because the regulations reduce domestic lending in FX, increase the average rate at which 
6:174:12868:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks lend, and reduce the share of banks’ non-performing loans, partly by reducing the 
6:175:12956:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:number of entities to which they lend. The FX regulations, however, also appear to have the 
6:176:13048:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:unintended consequence of causing companies to   partially shift   their    FX funding toward 
6:177:13141:19:19:75:529:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:international debt issuance, thereby mitigating the reduction in the aggregate exposure of the 
6:178:13236:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:economy to FX risk.  These results are robust to a series of sensitivity tests, including attempts 
6:179:13335:18:31:75:508:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to control for any potential endogeneity in the country’s decision to adjust FX measures.  
6:180:13425:31:19:102:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The   magnitudes of the est imates also    suggest that these direct and indirect effects of 
6:181:13518:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations are meaningful. A  tightening of FX  regulations causes banks 
6:182:13611:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to reduce their cross-border borrowing in FX by about a third,  a reduction equivalent to about 
6:183:13707:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:0.5%  -0.7 %  of  GDP.  For   major  emerging  markets,  such  as  Brazil or  Indonesia,  this  is 
6:184:13806:19:19:75:547:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:equivalent to reducing cross-border bank    FX borrowing by more than half.    At the same time, 
6:185:13903:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporates increase FX debt issuance by  about 10% of median annual FX debt issuance for the 
6:186:13996:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:full sample, equivalent to a 15%-20% increase in FX corporate debt issuance for emerging 
6:187:14085:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:markets such as Brazil and Indonesia. Combining these various estimates suggests that FX 
6:188:14174:19:19:75:525:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations still   cause a meaningful reduction in the aggregate FX borrowing of the country—
6:189:14268:19:19:75:529:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:as the reduction in cross-border FX bank borrowing is substantially greater than the increase 
6:190:14362:19:18:75:533:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:in FX corporate debt issuance—but that 10% -16% of the aggregate FX exposure shifts from 
6:191:14451:18:19:75:528:376:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks to other sectors (such as investors  and non-bank financial institutions). The    effects are 
6:192:14551:19:31:75:435:357:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:larger if the FX measures focus on bank liabilities instead of bank assets.   
6:193:14629:31:19:102:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Our    results  have several imp  ortant  implications.  They  support  a  growing  body  of 
6:194:14722:19:18:75:529:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:research showing that macroprudential regulations can be effective at accomplishing their 
6:195:14812:18:19:75:554:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:direct  goals5—in  this  case significantly reduc   ing   the  FX  exposure  of  banks  to  currency 
6:196:14913:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:movements. This  result is particularly relevant for the debate on how to address long-standing 
6:197:15009:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:concerns about vulnerabilities related to foreign currency borrowing and currency mismatch.6

6:199:15198:18:19:75:529:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Our    results  suggest  that any  such countries could     instead consider  macroprudential  FX 
6:200:15296:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations—especially  countries  for  which  capital  controls  (but  not  macroprudential  FX 
6:201:15393:19:40:75:528:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations) are illegal, such as in the European Economic Area and in some    trade agreements.

7:210:16227:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations work in terms of their direct goals, there can be leakages and 
7:211:16320:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:unintended consequences.7 Ranciere et al. (2010) highlight the importance of incorporating 
7:212:16411:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:these potential leakages in any analysis of the impact of macroprudential FX regulations. In 
7:213:16504:19:18:75:529:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:our analysis, these leakages are smaller than the direct effects of FX regulations, but still 
7:214:16598:18:31:75:280:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:significant and economically meaningful.  
7:215:16640:31:19:102:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A: Finally, this paper moves beyond most   other work     on macroprudential regulations by 
7:216:16730:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:assessing if the regulations  achieve the broader goal of improving financial resilience. The 
7:217:16824:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:results suggest that macroprudential FX  regulations can improve  the resilience of the banking 
7:218:16920:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:sector to currency fluctuations, but do less to improve the resilience of the broader economy 
7:219:17014:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to currency fluctuations. This may still provide net benefits by improving the resilience of 
7:220:17107:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banking institutions  that  can  create  broader  systemic  vulnerabilities,  just  as when  the 
7:221:17204:19:18:75:535:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:snowplow moves the snow off the road, it makes the road system safer. Yet , just as the snow 
7:222:17297:18:19:76:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:plow inevitably pushes a portion of the snow to block your driveway, macroprudential FX 
7:223:17385:19:19:76:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations can also shift some vulnerability to other sectors that are outside the regulatory 
7:224:17480:19:19:76:528:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:perimeter. These other institutions may be harder to monitor and less well informed than 
7:225:17569:19:18:76:529:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks, less able to screen for the risks inherent in corporate borrowing in FX, and less able to 
7:226:17666:18:19:76:541:376:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:handle subsequent losses after a depreciation. This shifting snowbank of r  isks could mitigate

7:228:17824:31:19:102:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This paper proceeds as follows. Section II  presents the theoretical model of bank and

8:243:19110:30:19:102:528:676:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Before assessing the impact of macroprudential FX regulations, we develop a simple 
8:244:19193:19:19:75:528:657:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:framework of bank versus market lending in domestic or foreign currency. This framework 
8:245:19281:19:19:75:528:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:shares with the seminal work of Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) the emphasis on asymmetric 
8:246:19368:19:18:75:528:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:information between lenders and borrowers, with banks as special lenders because of their 
8:247:19458:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:ability to reduce the consequences of asymmetric information at a cost. In Holmstrom and 
8:248:19547:19:19:75:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Tirole (1997), banks can monitor firms to reduce their moral hazard problem—a channel that 
8:249:19638:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:is absent in our model. Instead, we focus on how asymmetric information affects a lender’s 
8:250:19729:19:18:75:529:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:choice of the currency of their loans, where screening allows banks to identify more productive 
8:251:19825:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:firms that   are more likely to remain solvent after currency depreciations.8 While Holmstrom 
8:252:19919:19:19:75:529:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and Tirole (1997) consider an environment with a single good, we  consider two goods in order 
8:253:20013:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to   allow for a choice between foreign and    domestic currency.  Our model is not intended to 
8:254:20109:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:explain all of the factors that go into firm borrowing decisions, but instead provide structure 
8:255:20205:18:31:75:499:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and a framework for the key channels evaluated in the empirical analysis in the paper.9 
8:256:20292:31:20:102:528:420:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To begin, assume that   there are two dates, 푡푡= 0, 1, and a domestic D and a foreign F 
8:257:20378:20:19:75:528:400:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:good  .  Let 푒푒푡푡 be the exogenous exchange rate (the value of D goods in terms of F goods) at date 
8:258:20478:19:19:75:528:381:122:g_d0_f6:122:g_d0_f2:B:푡푡. We focus on FX risk (that is, the volatility of the exchange rate), with   no changes to its 
8:259:20575:19:19:75:528:362:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:expected level, which we normalize to one, 퐸퐸0 [푒푒1]=  푒푒0≡1. Specifically, the exchange rate 
8:260:20668:19:31:75:465:343:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:process is bivariate and can involve either depreciation or appreciation   :

8:263:20868:31:19:102:535:249:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The economy is populated by four    groups of risk-neutral agents: domestic firms, bank s, 
8:264:20959:19:18:75:528:230:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:investors, and savers. There are many banks,  investors, and    savers, each of whom take the 
8:265:21053:18:19:75:528:212:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:observable funding and lending rates as given and make zero profits due to competition.10 A

8:267:21245:19:20:75:526:174:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the foreign good, respectively. The outside option of savers is given by constant-returns-to-

8:269:21442:19:19:75:528:135:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:can  fund themselves in  domestic and foreign currency at these rates. Banks and investors are

8:271:21592:8:11:70:451:108:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:8 Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) is a seminal paper modelling bank screening in a one-good economy. 
8:272:21686:11:13:70:537:97:42:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:9 For example, the model and paper do not attempt to explain structural differences across countries in the reliance 
8:273:21802:13:8:70:260:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:on bank funding versus other forms of funding.

9:285:22825:19:19:75:531:472:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:its assets.  A bankrupt firm receives zero and, for simplicity, the bank or investor recoups its 
9:286:22922:19:30:75:433:453:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:asset value fully. Our results extend to partial recovery upon firm default. 
9:287:22998:30:19:102:528:423:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Relative  to  investors,  banks  are  special  in  that  they  have  access  to  a  screening

16:520:38245:31:18:102:528:399:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:More specifically, evidence suggests that exporters  tend to be larger and more productive 
16:521:38335:18:19:84:539:381:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:than non-exporters (e.g., Bernard et al., 20  03,   Melitz, 2003), so   we extend our framework 
16:522:38431:19:20:84:536:362:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:to assume that some high-productive firms are exporters. A   fraction of their output 퐴퐴퐻퐻 is  a 
16:523:38528:20:19:84:528:342:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:good   that is priced in 퐹퐹, offering a natural hedge against FX risk. The status of exporters is 
16:524:38626:19:19:84:528:323:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:publicly observable, so    investors can  infer    that these firms have high  productivity. Hence, 
16:525:38726:19:19:84:528:304:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:the competitive lending rate is 휌휌퐸퐸∗=푟푟퐹퐹 . This    cost of market funding in 퐹퐹 to exporters is 
16:526:38824:19:19:84:528:285:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:cheaper than bank funding in either currency, so exporters prefer to obtain funding from 
16:527:38913:19:31:84:387:266:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:investors in 퐹퐹–irrespective of macroprudential FX regulation. 
16:528:38975:31:19:102:528:235:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:All of the key implications from the model developed above continue to hold, except that 
16:529:39063:19:18:84:528:216:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:now   exporters default less often after a depreciation of the domestic currency. This lower 
16:530:39156:18:19:84:528:198:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:default probability is partly due to their natural hedge (with a share of production priced in 
16:531:39251:19:22:84:534:179:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f2:A:F), and partly due to their  cheaper funding.   Specifically, for  an intermediate depreciation

17:540:39758:30:19:102:528:676:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This section discusses the data used for the empirical analysis. It is divided into two 
17:541:39846:19:19:75:533:657:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:parts.  The  first  provides  details  on  the  newly  compiled  dataset  on  macroprudential  FX 
17:542:39944:19:19:75:528:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations that is central to this paper. The second discusses the additional explanatory and 
17:543:40039:19:30:75:263:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:control variables used in the  analysis.

17:545:40121:31:19:102:528:558:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:We define macroprudential FX regulations as regulations that discriminate based on the 
17:546:40208:19:19:75:528:539:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:currency denomination of a capital transaction.17 Macroprudential FX regulations usually 
17:547:40297:19:18:75:528:520:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:focus on the domestic banking system and can be implemented by the government, the central 
17:548:40388:18:19:75:528:502:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:bank, or the national prudential regulator. Our measures of macroprudential FX regulations 
17:549:40479:19:19:75:528:483:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:do not include capital controls—which discriminate by the residency of the parties involved in 
17:550:40574:19:19:75:528:464:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the transaction—although there is substantial overlap in these two types of measures given 
17:551:40665:19:18:75:528:445:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that   transactions between residents and non-residents are more likely to involve FX. Also,

17:554:40942:19:19:75:528:389:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:capital risk weights) can also be classified as microprudential regulations (which generally 
17:555:41035:19:30:75:351:370:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:target the resilience of individual financial institutions).  
17:556:41096:30:19:102:528:340:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To construct our database, we draw on four sources on   macro-prudential regulations: 
17:557:41182:19:19:75:528:321:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Shim et al. (2013  ), Vandenbussche et al. (2015), Cerutti et al. (2017), and Reinhardt and

17:559:41364:19:18:75:528:283:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f5:B:but includes some information on macroprudential FX regulations. More specifically, Shim et 
17:560:41456:18:19:75:533:265:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f2:B:al. (2013  ) provides  verbal descriptions of policy events broadly related to the housing sector 
17:561:41554:19:19:75:545:246:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:for  60  countries  at  a  monthly  frequency from 1990 -2012. Vandenbussche et  al.  (2015  ) 
17:562:41649:19:19:75:541:227:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:provides  detailed data on   a broad range of macroprudential policy actions for 16 countries 
17:563:41743:19:18:75:528:208:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:from Emerging Europe over the period 1997-2010. Cerutti et al. (2017) uses an IMF database 
17:564:41834:18:19:75:532:190:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:on country surveys to provide measures for 12 macroprudential policies, including on FX-  and

17:567:42116:19:49:75:556:133:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:starting in 1995. For   more details  on the construction  of this    dataset on macroprudential FX

18:571:42436:30:19:102:528:676:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:After combining these sources, our dataset includes information on 132 changes in 
18:572:42518:19:19:75:528:657:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations from 1995 through 2014 (on a quarterly basis) that represent 
18:573:42610:19:19:75:528:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:either a tightening or loosening in regulation. This full sample includes both advanced and 
18:574:42702:19:18:75:537:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:emerging economies, but we exclude reserve-issuing countries (i.e., long -standing members 
18:575:42793:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of the Euro Area, the US, Switzerland and Japan) to focus on countries more vulnerable to 
18:576:42883:19:19:75:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:currency mismatches and the global financial cycle. We also exclude offshore centers, as 
18:577:42972:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:defined by the BIS in International Banking Statistics, with the exception of Singapore and 
18:578:43064:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Hong Kong. This leaves us with a sample of 48 countries for our main empirical analysis.18 
18:579:43154:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Some countries have made no changes to macroprudential FX policy, while others have made 
18:580:43243:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:more than ten . There is good coverage of countries in Asia, Europe, and South America, but 
18:581:43335:19:31:75:357:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:coverage is more limited for   the Middle East and Africa.19

18:583:43483:18:19:75:529:439:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:through 2015. Any adoption or tightening of each regulation in the dataset is counted as a +1, 
18:584:43578:19:19:75:528:420:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and any reduction or removal is a -1, with the graph showing the cumulated total on the given

18:589:44021:32:19:84:528:313:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• FX  Asset-side  Measures  (in blue) include all policies aimed at the FX assets of 
18:590:44104:19:18:102:528:294:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:domestic  banks.  These  generally  focus  on  restricting  FX  lending  to  corporates  and

18:602:45119:11:7:70:360:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:emerging markets account for the vast majority of FX regulatory actions. 
18:603:45191:7:13:70:537:87:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:20 These two categories can be further disaggregated into various subcategories. We do not focus on the more detailed

19:613:46077:19:18:84:507:543:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:more rapidly just before the global financial crisis, and then experienced another surge 
19:614:46166:18:19:84:529:525:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:around 2010-11, but have since been adopted at a more moderate pace. Liability  -side FX 
19:615:46255:19:19:85:513:506:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:regulations were adopted more gradually from 2002-2006, after which use fell by about 
19:616:46341:19:19:85:514:487:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:half,    until    after 2010 they regained attention and their use roughly doubled during 2010-

19:618:46529:18:19:85:516:450:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:the economy. For example, measures targeting banks’ FX liabilities might affect their FX 
19:619:46618:19:19:85:521:431:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:lending to all their borrowers, while asset-side measures might only restrict FX lending to 
19:620:46710:19:31:85:392:412:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:specific borrowers (for example those lacking a natural hedge). 
19:621:46773:31:18:103:535:381:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:For a final cut of the data, Figure 2  uses the same categories to break out the number of 
19:622:46864:18:19:76:529:363:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:times each macroprudential FX measure was either tightened or loosened. This is useful to 
19:623:46954:19:19:76:528:344:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:better understand what is driving the cumulated statistics in Figure 1, as “no change” in the 
19:624:47048:19:19:76:529:325:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:cumulated graphs could mask no change in the given regulation by any country, or a number 
19:625:47138:19:18:76:528:306:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of countries which tightened the measure while an equal number simultaneously loosened. 
19:626:47226:18:19:76:528:288:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 2  shows that, in many periods, the latter is the case—with some years when a large 
19:627:47317:19:19:76:534:269:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:number of countries simultaneously tightened and loosened different policies. Figure 2  also 
19:628:47410:19:19:75:528:250:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:provides  more  detail  on  the phases of  tightening and  loosening in  macroprudential  FX 
19:629:47503:19:30:75:227:231:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations shown in Figure 1.

19:631:47595:31:19:102:528:170:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This section begins by discussing the international capital flow variables on bank and 
19:632:47682:19:19:75:528:151:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporate borrowing that will be the focus of the empirical tests. It closes with a discussion of 
19:633:47780:19:30:75:222:132:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the  various control variables.  
19:634:47812:30:19:102:525:102:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To begin, in order to test model prediction #1 on the impact of FX  regulations on cross-
19:635:47901:19:0:75:528:83:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:border loans to banks, we use quarterly data from the BIS International Banking Statistics 
20:636:47995:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:(IBS)   , which reports both FX and non-FX gross capital inflows to banks. These data are 
20:637:48085:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:expressed as a percent of annual GDP ( calculated as 4-quarter moving averages).21 In order to 
20:638:48180:19:19:75:529:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:test model prediction #2 on the spillover effects of the regulations, we use data from the BIS 
20:639:48275:19:19:75:533:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:International  Debt  Statistics  (IDS),  which  includes  debt  securities  issued  by  domestic 
20:640:48372:19:30:75:441:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:headquartered companies on international markets in FX and non-FX.    
20:641:48442:30:19:102:563:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 3  graph   s  several of these measures which will be a focus of the empirical analysis. 
20:642:48538:19:19:75:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 3a shows the evolution of cross-border loans to banks as a percent of GDP, broken into 
20:643:48632:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:loans in FX (red) and non-FX (blue). This shows the decline in cross-border lending since 
20:644:48722:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:around the crisis, with basically all of the decline occurring in FX lending. Figure 3b shows 
20:645:48816:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:international debt issuance over the same period, also broken down into FX (solid lines) and 
20:646:48909:19:19:75:547:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:non-   FX borrowing (dashed lines), and further distinguished into borrowing by banks (green) 
20:647:49003:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and corporates (orange). This shows that international debt issuance in FX has increased 
20:648:49092:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:fairly  steadily since the crisis for corporates, but fallen for banks. Non-FX borrowing by 
20:649:49184:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporates has been fairly flat, and for banks has decreased. These graphs are only suggestive, 
20:650:49280:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:but the trends agree with the model’s prediction; after a tightening in macroprudential FX 
20:651:49371:19:19:75:528:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations (such as after the 2008 crisis), cross-border FX lending by banks declines (with 
20:652:49464:19:18:75:528:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:no change in non-FX lending by banks), while corporate debt issuance in FX increases (with 
20:653:49555:18:31:75:525:376:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:no increase in corporate non-FX debt issuance or bank debt issuance in FX or non-FX).     
20:654:49645:31:19:102:528:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The empirical analysis also includes a number of control variables that merit discussion. 
20:655:49735:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:These variables were chosen to be consistent with existing literature, most closely following 
20:656:49829:19:18:75:529:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:recent work on the determinants of cross-border bank flows in Avdjiev et al. (2016a) and 
20:657:49918:18:19:75:532:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Bruno and Shin (2016).  An innovation in our control variables is that when we calculate the 
20:658:50011:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exposure of country i to certain variables in other countries, we weight the respective variable 
20:659:50108:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:by  country i’s  “financial  exposure”  instead  of  its  trade  exposure.  As shown  in  Lane  and 
20:660:50208:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Shambaugh (2010) and Bénétrix et al. (2015), this can be important when countries have 
20:661:50295:18:19:76:529:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:different currency than trade exposures (such as many emerging markets which are more 
20:662:50381:19:19:76:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exposed to US dollar movements than predicted based purely on trade patterns). A sensitivity 
20:663:50474:19:31:76:381:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:test shows that this weighting does not impact the key results.  
20:664:50538:31:18:103:549:145:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:We include five variables in our baseline specification, focusing on variables with    some 
20:665:50630:18:32:76:522:127:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:time   variation so that they are   not   absorbed in the   country fixed effects. These controls are:  
20:666:50733:32:8:228:231:95:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
20:667:50788:8:13:70:537:87:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:21 In the BIS banking statistics, capital ‘flows’ are calculated as estimated exchange rate-adjusted changes in stocks; 
20:668:50908:13:0:70:479:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:therefore they should not be affected by exchange-rate valuation effects. See Appendix A  of this paper.  
21:669:51017:0:18:102:528:705:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• Changes  in  non-FX  macroprudential  regulation:  measured  by  calculating  any 
21:670:51100:18:19:75:528:687:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:change in macroprudential regulations in the four datasets discussed above    (from Shim et al., 
21:671:51197:19:19:75:528:668:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:2013  ;  Vandenbussche et al., 2015  ;  Cerutti et al., 2017; and     Reinhardt and Sowerbutts, 2018) 
21:672:51298:19:19:75:528:649:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:for country i. Then any changes in FX regulations are removed. The resulting measure is 
21:673:51386:19:18:75:525:630:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:reported as +1 for any new use/tightening of any non-FX macroprudential regulation, and a -
21:674:51477:18:19:75:528:612:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:1 for any reduction/removal. The variable is  the sum of its contemporaneous effect as well as 
21:675:51572:19:32:75:499:593:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:three lags. Appendix A in Ahnert et al. (2018) discusses the compilation in more detail. 
21:676:51660:32:19:102:528:561:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• Real GDP growth: measured as quarterly real GDP (yoy) growth based on IMF 
21:677:51735:19:31:75:478:542:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:statistics. This is a standard control to capture changes in country-specific returns. 
21:678:51821:31:21:102:528:511:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• Exchange rate volatility, weighted based on country financial exposure: calculated

21:680:52005:24:18:75:528:466:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the weekly change in the bilateral exchange rate between the domestic economy and foreign 
21:681:52095:18:19:75:555:448:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:country n. This controls for the relative riskiness of FX-  versus non-FX  loans    (see Rosenberg 
21:682:52194:19:32:75:322:429:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and Tirpak, 2009 and Brown and De Haas, 2012).  
21:683:52240:32:22:102:529:397:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• Interest rate differential, weighted based on country financial exposure: calculated 
21:684:52326:22:24:75:528:375:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:as ∑⋅−=FtnFtnDtiwi,,, where Dtiis the domestic (D) nominal interest rate in quarter t; Ftnw, is the

21:686:52529:24:18:75:528:327:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:country n in quarter t, and n captures the major currencies/currency areas (USD, GBP, EUR, 
21:687:52620:18:19:75:528:309:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:YEN,  CHF).  This  controls  for  the  return/funding  costs  of  FX  loans  relative  to  the 
21:688:52715:19:19:75:528:290:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:return/funding costs of non-FX loans.22 The weightings place more weight on the relative 
21:689:52804:19:32:75:376:271:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:funding differentials for the most relevant countries/regions.  
21:690:52867:32:18:102:528:239:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:A:• Sovereign rating: measured as the change in sovereign rating, based on data from 
21:691:52949:18:32:75:445:221:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Trading Economics in order to capture any changes in country-specific risk.

22:700:53576:19:31:75:146:657:122:Georgia:122:Georgia:C:Regulations 
22:701:53587:31:19:102:528:626:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This  section  formally  tests  how  macroprudential  FX  regulations  affect  different 
22:702:53676:19:18:75:528:607:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:components of capital inflows, building on the theoretical framework developed in Section II. 
22:703:53770:18:19:75:546:589:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:It  begins by developing  the   specification that will be used for the remainder of the section. 
22:704:53868:19:19:75:534:570:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Then    it reports the central results on how macroprudential FX  regulations affect various types

22:706:54061:19:18:75:528:532:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:analysis, we aggregate the different types of macroprudential FX regulations. The    section ends 
22:707:54159:18:19:75:540:514:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:with    tests    for different effects of the disaggregated measures of m  acroprudential regulations. 
22:708:54262:19:19:75:528:495:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:It  is  worth  noting  that  a  key  aspect  of  this  series  of  tests  is  not  just  the  effects  of 
22:709:54368:19:19:75:528:476:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations on certain types of capital flows (such as bank borrowing in

22:724:55639:18:27:75:537:142:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX measures (discussed in Section III .A), expressed as a dummy variable 
22:725:55728:27:8:228:231:115:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
22:726:55783:8:13:70:537:107:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:23 Quarterly capital inflows are scaled by annual GDP, which is calculated as a 4-quarter moving average of annual 
22:727:55898:13:10:70:536:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:data to avoid breaks due to annual GDP rising or falling from Q4 to Q1. We scale by annual GDP rather than quarterly 
22:728:56015:10:10:70:536:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:GDP because the sum of the contemporaneous coefficient and three lags on fxmi,t reported in the regression tables can 
22:729:56133:10:0:70:389:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:then be read as the effect on capital flows to annual GDP over a one year period. 
23:730:56218:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that takes the value of +1 if restrictions on FX lending or borrowing are tightened (and −1 if 
23:731:56313:18:19:75:561:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:they are loo sened  ).  To account for potential time lags in the impact of these policies, we 
23:732:56408:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:include the contemporaneous value of fxmi,t as well as its three lags, and evaluate their joint

23:735:56705:18:31:75:368:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:global time effects. The sample period is 1996 Q1–  2014 Q4. 
23:736:56765:31:19:102:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Several details of this specification and variables merit further discussion.24 First, the

23:738:56958:20:19:75:528:543:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:predictions  of  the  model  and  better  understand  the  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  the 
23:739:57057:19:19:75:528:524:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations. More specifically, in order to test model prediction #1 on the 
23:740:57152:19:20:75:528:505:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:impact of the regulations on cross-border loans to banks, Fi,t is measured as FX or non-FX 
23:741:57243:20:19:75:528:485:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:gross capital inflows to banks, as well as the FX share of total capital inflows to banks. In order 
23:742:57343:19:20:75:528:466:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to test model prediction #2 on the spillover effects of the regulations, Fi,t, is measured as FX 
23:743:57440:20:19:75:528:446:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and non-FX net international debt issuance by corporates and banks, as well as the change in 
23:744:57533:19:18:75:528:427:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the FX share of total net debt issuance by each group. (Extensions also consider the impact of 
23:745:57628:18:31:75:435:409:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations on total loans to banks and total debt issuance by corporates.) 
23:746:57703:31:19:102:548:378:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:A  second noteworthy feature of equation (16)    is the measure of macroprudential FX

23:748:57885:19:18:75:528:340:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations and discussed in more detail in Appendix A of  Ahnert et al. 
23:749:57976:18:19:75:528:322:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:(2018). In our main analysis, this aggregates all of the different types of macroprudential FX 
23:750:58071:19:19:75:528:303:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations, but in some extensions it only includes changes in FX regulations targeting bank 
23:751:58165:19:31:75:498:284:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:assets or those targeting bank liabilities, disaggregated as discussed in Section III.A.   
23:752:58256:31:20:102:528:253:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:A final important point in equation (16)    is the time fixed effects (δt), which are included 
23:753:58351:20:19:75:528:233:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to control for all global factors common across countries in each period. These global factors 
23:754:58446:19:18:75:528:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:have been shown to be an important driver of global capital flows, such as in Forbes and 
23:755:58535:18:19:75:528:196:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Warnock (2012), Rey (2013), and Avdjiev et al. (2016a), but there are different views on which 
23:756:58630:19:19:75:528:177:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:factors are most important (such as the role of global risk or monetary policy in advanced 
23:757:58721:19:33:75:528:158:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:economies). By controlling for a global-time fixed effect, we do not need to take a stance on 
23:758:58815:33:8:228:231:125:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
23:759:58870:8:12:70:537:117:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:24 To ensure that large observations are not driving the results, all dependent and independent variables are winsorised 
23:760:58991:12:11:70:536:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:at the 2.5% level (except for variables based on bounded indices). In order to account for exchange rate valuation 
23:761:59106:11:10:70:537:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:effects, changes in shares are calculated based on a series of stocks calculated by adding cumulated exchange rate 
23:762:59221:10:10:70:536:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:adjusted changes in bank loans and deposits or net issuance of debt securities to initial stocks. Before winsorising the 
23:763:59342:10:0:70:378:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:resulting shares, we exclude changes in shares above +100% or below -100%.

24:765:59516:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that are difficult to measure. To show that this assumption does not affect our main results, 
24:766:59610:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:however, we also report tests where we include standard global variables that have been 
24:767:59698:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:shown to be associated with global capital flows (such as global volatility, global growth, and 
24:768:59794:19:18:75:529:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:changes  in  US  monetary  policy)  instead  of  this  common  global-time  fixed  effect.  These 
24:769:59892:18:31:75:498:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:different specifications of global factors have no meaningful impact on the key results.

24:775:60299:31:19:102:529:464:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To test these predictions, Table 1  begins by testing for the effects of FX regulations on 
24:776:60390:19:18:75:528:445:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:gross cross-border loans     from    international banks to domestic banks—using the specification

24:778:60586:19:19:75:528:408:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations should reduce the volume of FX borrowing and share of FX 
24:779:60674:19:19:75:528:389:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing by banks, with no significant effect on banks’  non  -FX borrowing. The first three

24:787:61453:19:19:75:528:239:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:variables. Also, to simplify an interpretation of the results, the coefficients on macroprudential 
24:788:61552:19:19:75:538:220:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:FX regulation s  and non-FX regulations are   reported as the sum of the quarterly coefficient 
24:789:61647:19:19:75:528:201:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:estimates (∑훽훽13푘푘=0), with a reported p-value to indicate if the sum is jointly significant. These 
24:790:61747:19:19:75:528:182:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:are written in italics, with no parentheses around the p-values, to clarify that this is distinct 
24:791:61845:19:31:75:483:163:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:from    the  other coefficient estimates reported with standard errors  (in parentheses). 
24:792:61935:31:19:102:528:132:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The coefficient estimates in Table 1 support the predictions on how macroprudential FX 
24:793:62022:19:29:75:528:113:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations affect international borrowing by domestic banks. Tighter macroprudential FX

24:795:62166:8:0:70:539:76:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:25 The   global variables follow the capital flow literature, such as Forbes and Warnock (2012) and Avdjiev et al. (2016a).  
25:796:62294:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations are correlated with a significant decrease in foreign currency borrowing by banks 
25:797:62388:18:19:75:529:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and in the FX share of total international borrowing by banks, over the subsequent year. To 
25:798:62480:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:put the magnitude of these estimates into context, cross   -border FX loans to banks fall over a 
25:799:62577:19:19:75:567:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:one -year period by 0.  50 % –  0.6 6% of GDP following a tightening in FX regulations. This 
25:800:62670:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:suggests the effect of macroprudential regulations on cross-border FX loans to banks is large 
25:801:62764:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and    meaningful. FX loans are around 1.9% of GDP at the median of our sample (across 
25:802:62851:19:19:75:528:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:quarters when inflows were positive), suggesting that tighter FX regulations corresponds to a 
25:803:62945:19:19:75:528:575:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:decline in FX cross-border loans by banks of  about one-third. Or, to put this in the context of 
25:804:63042:19:18:75:528:556:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:individual  countries,  consider  Brazil  and Indonesia—two  countries  which  have  been 
25:805:63132:18:19:75:528:538:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:concerned about FX exposure. In both countries, FX loans to banks are a little less than 1% of 
25:806:63227:19:19:75:536:519:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:GDP ,  suggesting  that  an  increase  in  macroprudential  FX  regulations  corresponds  to  a 
25:807:63323:19:31:75:290:500:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in FX loans to banks by over half. 
25:808:63368:31:18:102:531:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast, and as also expected, the inc rease in macroprudential FX regulations does 
25:809:63456:18:19:76:572:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:not have a significant effect on non-FX  borrowing by banks (columns  3,  6,  and 9   ). Banks do 
25:810:63554:19:19:76:529:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:not significantly increase their borrowing in local currency to compensate for their reduced 
25:811:63647:19:19:76:528:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing in FX. Corresponding estimates for the impact of macroprudential FX regulations 
25:812:63737:19:18:76:528:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:on total international borrowing by banks (not reported) show that the aggregate effect is 
25:813:63828:18:19:76:528:376:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:weakly negative—as expected—but only significant at the 10% level. This suggests that the

25:818:64253:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and sovereign ratings—which suggest that faster growth and higher ratings are significantly 
25:819:64345:19:19:75:527:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:correlated with increased capital inflows, especially in foreign currency. The global variables 
25:820:64441:19:18:75:533:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:also have the expected signs  in columns (7) through (9), with lower volatility, higher global 
25:821:64536:18:19:75:528:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:growth, and lower US interest rates correlated with stronger FX borrowing by banks. The 
25:822:64624:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:other  results  are  basically  unchanged  when  these  global  control  variables  are  included,

25:824:64822:30:19:102:542:146:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Next, Table 2 follows the same format as Table 1, except now tests   how macroprudential 
25:825:64911:19:22:75:528:127:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:FX regulations affect international debt issuance by domestic corporations (Hypothesis #2). 
25:826:65003:22:8:228:231:105:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
25:827:65058:8:13:70:536:97:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:26 An increase in non-FX macroprudential regulations is usually positively associated with cross-border inflows, albeit 
25:828:65178:13:10:70:541:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:generally insignificant. T his could indicate that increased regulation increases confidence in the financial system and 
25:829:65299:10:0:70:528:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:thereby supports greater inflows, as tentatively found in Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) and Forbes et al.    (2015). 
26:830:65421:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:The  coefficient  estimates  on  macroprudential  FX  regulations in  Table  2 again have  the 
26:831:65516:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:predicted effects. Tighter  macroprudential  regulations  are  correlated  with  a  significant 
26:832:65612:19:19:75:531:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increase in foreign currency debt issuance by corporates,  and a significant increase in the 
26:833:65705:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:share of corporate debt issued in FX by corporates, with no significant effect on non-FX debt 
26:834:65799:19:18:75:531:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:issuance.  The magnitude of these effects continues to be economically meaningful, albeit 
26:835:65889:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:substantially smaller than that of increased regulations on international bank flows. More 
26:836:65980:19:19:75:528:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:specifically, international debt issuance by corporates increases  by  0.05% to  0.06%    of GDP 
26:837:66076:19:19:75:528:575:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:following  a  tightening  in  FX  regulations.  This  suggests  the  effect  of  macroprudential 
26:838:66173:19:18:75:550:556:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations on cross-border FX corporate debt issuance is moderate, given that net   FX  debt 
26:839:66267:18:19:75:528:538:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:issuance is  around 0.6%  of GDP (at the sample median when net FX debt issuance was 
26:840:66352:19:19:75:528:519:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:positive). For some countries, however, the impact is substantially larger. For example, in 
26:841:66444:19:19:75:528:500:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Brazil and Indonesia FX d  ebt issuance is 0.26  %  and   0.36 % of GDP,  respectively, suggesting 
26:842:66543:19:30:75:513:481:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that tighter FX regulations correspond to roughly a 15%    to  20 % increase in this issuance.   
26:843:66640:30:19:102:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Combining the results of Tables  1 and 2 allows us to assess the aggregate effects of an 
26:844:66729:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increase in macroprudential FX measures on country exposure to FX risk through banks, as 
26:845:66818:19:19:75:533:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:well as the degree of “shifting snowbanks” (i.e., the substitution of FX exposure from banks  to 
26:846:66915:19:18:75:528:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:investors who hold the new FX corporate debt issuance). This   shifting of FX risk can be 
26:847:67005:18:19:75:528:376:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:calculated as the ratio of net FX debt issuance by corporates to international FX loans to 
26:848:67096:19:19:75:528:357:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks. This ratio indicates that   after an increase in FX regulations, about 10% of the decline 
26:849:67193:19:19:75:528:338:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:in FX exposure in banks shifts to corporate debt issuance (and thereby to investors and other

26:851:67383:18:19:75:528:301:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:FX regulations on banks leads to some “shifting snowbanks” of currency risk to other sectors 
26:852:67476:19:19:75:529:282:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of the economy, namely investors in our framework, there is still a meaningful net reduction 
26:853:67569:19:31:75:288:263:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:in aggregate FX borrowing in the economy. 
26:854:67611:31:18:102:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To complete the hypothesis testing and better understand the full set of relationships for

26:856:67798:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:B1 reports several additional results. Columns  (1) through (3) test for any impact of FX 
26:857:67888:19:18:75:526:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations on cross-border loans to non-banks. Although this data includes loans to non-

26:860:68136:8:12:70:535:117:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:27 Another way to calculate this ratio would be to adjust for the fact that not all FX lending by banks goes to corporates—
26:861:68259:12:11:70:537:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:with recently enhanced BIS data showing that on, average, 62% of FX loans from banks to non-banks are lent to the 
26:862:68373:11:10:70:537:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:corporate sector (with the remainder lent to households, government and non-bank financials). Taking this into 
26:863:68484:10:10:70:537:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:account, the “shifting” effect of FX exposure would be about 13% (instead of 10%). This new BIS data, however, is only 
26:864:68603:10:0:70:511:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:available for limited countries (Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, United Kingdom, Korea, Sweden and South Africa). 
27:865:68713:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:channel in the model (which only focuses on corporates), it finds no significant effect of FX 
27:866:68807:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations on cross-border loans to non-banks. This would agree with the model’s prediction 
27:867:68900:19:31:75:366:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of no significant effect on cross-border loans to corporates.  
27:868:68962:31:19:102:528:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we examine the impact of macroprudential FX regulations on domestic lending by 
27:869:69047:19:18:75:533:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks to corporates. The theoretical model suggests  that domestic lending by banks in FX 
27:870:69137:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:should decline (corresponding to the reduction in bank cross-border funding in FX), with no 
27:871:69229:19:19:75:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:significant decline in domestic bank lending in domestic currency. Unfortunately, our lending 
27:872:69323:19:19:75:528:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:dataset only includes cross-border capital flows and does not have information on domestic 
27:873:69414:19:18:75:548:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:lending. Therefore, to test this chan  nel, we    use enhanced BIS data that    provides information 
27:874:69515:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:on domestic lending in both local and foreign currencies.28 This data, however, has several 
27:875:69607:19:19:75:536:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:limitations: it only begins in 2012Q3 (thereby truncating our sample in roughly half);  it only 
27:876:69703:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:covers 30%  of the countries in our sample; and it is only available for lending to non-banks 
27:877:69797:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:(which includes non-bank financials) and not just corporates (as in the model).  With these 
27:878:69889:18:19:75:541:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:important caveats, the results in  columns (4) through (6) of Appendix Table B1   support the 
27:879:69983:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:main predictions of the model.29 An increase in FX regulations corresponds to a significant 
27:880:70075:19:19:75:529:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in FX  domestic lending by banks to non-banks (largely corporates) over the next 
27:881:70166:19:30:75:445:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:year  , with no significant effect on non-FX lending by banks to non-banks.30  
27:882:70245:30:19:102:528:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, as an additional set of tests to “complete the story”, columns (6) through (9) of

27:887:70710:19:19:75:549:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:predictions, and sharply  contrasts w ith   the results for corporate debt issuance (a significant

27:889:70903:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:suggests  that  there  may  be  a  weakly  negative  effect for  bank  debt  issuance—albeit  only 
27:890:71002:18:19:75:537:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:significant at the 10% level for FX inflows. This  weakly negative impact on bank FX debt 
27:891:71092:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:issuance may reflect the overall reduction in bank exposure to FX risk after increased FX 
27:892:71182:19:19:75:528:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations. It is unsurprising that bank s reduce this risk more through loans than net debt

27:898:71727:9:13:70:537:87:42:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:30 The coefficient on the share of FX lending is negative (as expected), but insignificant. This reflects the small decline 
27:899:71850:13:0:70:380:74:81:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:?:in non-FX domestic lending, mitigating  the impact on the ratio of FX lending. 
28:900:71932:0:30:75:392:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:FX regulations primarily target debt/loans at shorter maturities.

28:916:73311:19:18:75:528:370:122:g_d0_f2:116:g_d0_f2:B:work through somewhat different channels than those targeting the asset-side (i.e., aimed at 
28:917:73404:18:19:75:528:352:116:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:raising the cost of bank FX lending to households and corporates in the domestic economy). This 
28:918:73500:19:19:75:528:333:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:section  tests for  any  differential  effects  of  the  various  forms  of  macroprudential  FX 
28:919:73597:19:19:75:528:314:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations.  These results should be interpreted cautiously, however, as these finer divisions 
28:920:73693:19:18:75:528:295:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of  different  forms  of macroprudential  FX  regulations  imply  that  there  are  more  limited 
28:921:73791:18:31:75:250:277:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:degrees of freedom for the analysis. 
28:922:73828:31:19:102:533:246:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:To begin, we  focus on any differential effects if the FX macroprudential regulations 
28:923:73914:19:19:75:528:227:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:target banks’ assets or liabilities, using the definitions discussed in Section III.A.31 Results are 
28:924:74015:19:18:75:528:208:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:shown in Table 3, which repeats the baseline framework from Tables 1 and 2, with the full set 
28:925:74109:18:19:75:543:190:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of control variables and global-period dummy variables.32 The results are similar for   asset- 
28:926:74204:19:19:75:528:171:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and liability-based measures when assessing the effect on cross-border loans to banks, but 
28:927:74295:19:18:75:542:152:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:differ when assessing the impact on FX   debt issuance by corporates. More specifically, both 
28:928:74389:18:28:75:528:134:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:asset- and  liability-side  FX  measures  are  correlated  with  a  significant  decrease  in  FX 
28:929:74487:28:9:228:231:106:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
28:930:74542:9:13:70:537:97:42:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:31 We h   ave also examined effects using narrower definitions of FX regulations, but the number of regulatory actions 
28:931:74659:13:8:70:520:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:quickly becomes so limited that results become sensitive to minor changes in specification and country inclusion. 
28:932:74772:8:0:70:534:76:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:32 Results are basically identical when the individual global variables are included instead of the global-time dummy. 
29:933:74894:0:18:75:526:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing by banks—with the magnitude of the coefficient estimated to be larger for asset-
29:934:74984:18:19:75:531:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:side regulations,  but only significant at the 10% level in column (8). For both measures, FX 
29:935:75078:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations continue to have a positive effect on FX debt issuance by corporates—but this 
29:936:75168:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:effect is only estimated to be significant (at either the 5% or 10% level) for liability-side 
29:937:75262:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations. The magnitude of the coefficient on FX debt issuance is also estimated to be about 
29:938:75358:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:three times large   r  for liability-  side than asset-side regulations (In both cases, there continues 
29:939:75462:19:31:75:457:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to  be no significant effect on non-FX debt issuance by corporates and banks.).  
29:940:75543:31:19:102:532:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:These results suggest that both asset- and liability-side FX measures are effective in  their 
29:941:75637:19:18:76:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:direct goal of reducing cross-border loans to banks in FX. Only the liability-side measures, 
29:942:75730:18:19:76:542:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:however,  may  also  have  the  unintended side  -effect  of  increasing FX    debt  issuance  by 
29:943:75828:19:19:76:531:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporates.  Repeating  the calculations  to  gauge  the  degree  of “shifting”,  an  increase  in 
29:944:75927:19:19:76:537:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:lia bility   -side   FX  measures causes FX debt issuance by corporates to increase by 16%  of the 
29:945:76026:19:18:76:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:reduction in FX loans  by banks (instead of 10% when all FX regulations are aggregated).33 In 
29:946:76120:18:19:75:557:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:other words, liability-side regulations appear to cause more    “shifting snowbanks”    of  currency 
29:947:76221:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:vulnerability  from  banks  to  other  sectors.  As  a  result,  asset-side  regulations  may better 
29:948:76322:19:19:75:528:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:improve a country’s  resilience to currency movements, as they decrease bank exposure to 
29:949:76411:19:30:75:480:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:currency risk but simultaneously generate less shifting of this risk to other sectors.  
29:950:76498:30:19:102:528:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:One possible reason for these differential effects, as suggested in the theoretical model, 
29:951:76589:19:19:75:528:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:is that liability-based measures affect all forms of bank funding in all states of the world. In 
29:952:76686:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:contrast, asset-based measures only affect bank lending, and often only certain segments of 
29:953:76778:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:bank lending (such as through mortgages) —   thus    affecting a smaller share of bank balance 
29:954:76873:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:sheets and having a smaller aggregate effect. Closely related, if  asset-   side regulations primarily 
29:955:76976:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:affect  bank  lending  to  households,  while  liability-side  regulations  affect  lending  to  both 
29:956:77078:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporates and households, it is  natural that tighter liability-side FX regulations correspond 
29:957:77174:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to  a greater response in the corporate sector. Supporting this hypothesis, in some countries 
29:958:77268:18:19:75:528:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:most    FX regulations target the asset-   side  , a large share of which are regulations on LTV ratios, 
29:959:77373:19:19:75:529:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:DTI ratios, and other aspects of FX lending for mortgages (such as in Hungary and Poland). 
29:960:77464:19:19:75:538:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:A  final    possible explanation is  the maturity of the capital flows targeted by the se different 
29:961:77564:19:18:75:526:157:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:measures. FX liability-based measures tend to focus on shorter-term inflows, while FX asset-
29:962:77656:18:34:75:528:139:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:based measures tend to focus on longer-term maturities. As macroprudential measures often 
29:963:77746:34:8:228:231:105:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
29:964:77801:8:13:70:541:97:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:33 This is calculated as 0.0788 (Table 3, column 4) divided by 0.487 (Table 3, column 1). If one also incorporates that 
29:965:77921:13:10:70:541:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:only about 62% of FX loans from banks to non-banks are likely lent to the corporate sector, the degree of shifting 
29:966:78036:10:0:70:141:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:increases  to 26%. 
30:967:78058:0:18:75:526:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:involve a greater relative cost for short-term than longer-term capital flows, these shorter-
30:968:78151:18:31:75:262:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:term flows are the ones most affected. 
30:969:78189:31:19:102:528:657:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Macroprudential FX regulations could have different effects based not only on whether 
30:970:78275:19:19:75:531:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:they target assets or liabilities, but also based on how large the change in the regulation is . 
30:971:78372:19:18:75:528:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Assessing the intensity of changes in macroprudential regulation is difficult, however, because 
30:972:78468:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:most data on macroprudential regulations only records whether the regulation is tightened or 
30:973:78561:19:19:75:531:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:loosened using dummy variables (as in our data set). This is  the standard treatment in the 
30:974:78653:19:19:75:531:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:literature,  because  it  is  impossible  to  compare  discrete  changes  in  different  types  of 
30:975:78752:19:18:75:545:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations (i.e.,   a 10% increase in FX reserve requirements is unlikely to correspond to a 10% 
30:976:78850:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increase in the FX  liquidity coverage ratio). It is even difficult to compare changes of the same 
30:977:78949:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:magnitude in  a  specific  FX  regulation  across  countries, given  different definitions and 
30:978:79044:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:coverage (i.e., a 10% increase in the liquidity coverage ratio can mean very different things 
30:979:79138:19:18:75:528:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:based on the country’s definition of what qualifies as a liquid asset). A few papers have shown 
30:980:79234:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that    having more macroprudential  measures  in  place or   “major”  changes  in regulations 
30:981:79329:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:generate larger effects, results t hat   are   intuitive but do not provide concrete information on 
30:982:79429:19:31:75:505:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:how a given change in a regulation would be expected to affect a key outcome variable.34 
30:983:79517:31:18:102:528:382:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:In an effort to move beyond this standard treatment of macroprudential regulations, we 
30:984:79604:18:19:75:528:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:extend  our  analysis  to  estimate  the  impact  of  concrete  changes  in  specific regulatory 
30:985:79701:19:19:75:528:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:instruments. More specifically, we focus on two databases which provide information on the 
30:986:79792:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:intensity of macroprudential FX policies, albeit in a limited sample or for a limited set of 
30:987:79884:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:measures. First, Cerutti et al. (2017) includes data with information on the intensity of FX 
30:988:79977:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f5:B:reserve requirement changes for a sample similar to ours.35 Second, Vandenbussche et al. 
30:989:80066:19:19:75:532:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:(2012) includes information on the intensity of other types of regulations:  foreign currency

30:991:80259:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:weights on foreign currency mortgage loans, consumer loans and corporate loans.  These more

30:993:80446:19:19:75:550:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:missing a  period  of  active  use  of  macropr udential  FX  regulations)  and    the  data  is  only 
30:994:80549:19:38:75:436:176:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:available for Eastern Europe (thereby severely limiting country coverage). 
30:995:80624:38:9:228:231:138:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:C:                                                        
30:996:80679:9:13:70:540:129:42:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:34 More specifically, Cerutti et al. (2017) c reate a measure which is the sum of the number of different types of 
30:997:80793:13:10:70:537:116:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:macroprudential measures in use. Forbes et al. (2015) classify a subset of their measures of capital controls and 
30:998:80907:10:10:70:537:106:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:macroprudential measures as those which were “major”, based on the attention by investors, financial analysts, or 
30:999:81021:10:9:70:490:96:81:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:?:international financial institutions (as assessed by coverage in analyst reports, IMF papers, and surveys).  
30:1000:81129:9:13:71:537:87:42:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:35 Specifically, the authors state that given the mostly quantitative nature of reserve requirements, values above or 
30:1001:81247:13:0:71:506:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:below 1 and –1 for their index can capture the intensity in the changes (with the index   ranging from    -3 to +5). 
31:1002:81367:0:18:102:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Keeping these    caveats in mind,  the   resulting estimates give some idea of the magnitude 
31:1003:81459:18:19:75:528:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of the effects from these specif   ic FX regulations. First, a large increase in reserve requirements 
31:1004:81561:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:on foreign currency borrowing (proxied by the quantitative index taking a value of 5) leads to 
31:1005:81655:19:19:75:550:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:a decline in FX loans to banks by 0.46%    of GDP and an increase in FX international debt 
31:1006:81746:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:issuance by 0.15%  of GDP. Second, an increase in the foreign currency liquidity requirement 
31:1007:81839:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:by 10pp reduces FX loans to banks  by 2.9% of GDP and increases international FX debt 
31:1008:81925:19:19:75:528:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:issuance by corporates by 0.36% of GDP. Third   , a tightening in the maximum ratio of FX loans 
31:1009:82021:19:19:75:528:575:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:to own funds from 400% to 200% reduces FX loans to banks by around 1% of GDP and 
31:1010:82102:19:18:75:528:556:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increases FX debt issuance by corporates by 0.05% of GDP.  Finally, an increase in the risk

31:1018:82803:31:18:102:534:382:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The   finding that macroprudential FX  regulations significantly reduce bank borrowing in

31:1020:82982:19:19:75:544:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:these   regulations, so   we next perform a  series of robustness checks, including   specifications 
31:1021:83083:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:that should better identify the exogenous component of macroprudential regulations. For 
31:1022:83171:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:each test, we focus on whether macroprudential FX regulations decrease international bank 
31:1023:83261:18:19:75:529:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing (or share of borrowing) in FX and non-FX, and whether they increase corporate 
31:1024:83349:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:debt issuance (or share of debt issuance) in FX and non-FX (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). We 
31:1025:83443:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:do not report all of the “non-results” that are not significant (nor expected to be significant),

31:1027:83615:30:19:93:528:202:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:One potential concern with the baseline analysis is that   trends in our dependent variables 
31:1028:83708:19:19:75:528:183:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:could be driving changes in macroprudential policy instead of vice-versa (i.e., endogeneity).37 
31:1029:83803:19:18:75:529:164:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:For example, increased corporate debt issuance in FX could heighten concerns about risks to

31:1033:84166:12:8:70:477:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:the baseline regressions in Tables 1 and 2, including all of the control variables and global time effects. 
31:1034:84273:8:13:70:536:97:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:37  Omitted  variable  bias  is  also  a  frequent  concern  in  cross-country  empirical  papers,  as  some  hard-to-measure 
31:1035:84399:13:10:70:572:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:variables could simultaneously affect    cross   -border capital flows and FX regulations. This is less of a concern in our 
31:1036:84523:10:0:70:507:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:framework, however, due to the tests for “non-results” corresponding  to our main results (as in   Section IV.B).

32:1039:84835:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:estimates an “exogenous” shock to macroprudential policy, following the   approach used in 
32:1040:84926:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013) to  estimate more exogenous fiscal policy shocks and in 
32:1041:85016:19:18:75:547:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Furceri et al. (2016) to estimate more exogenous monetary policy shocks. We    estimate a first-
32:1042:85112:18:19:75:538:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:stage regression of FX regulations on a range of variables that could affect the implementation  
32:1043:85209:19:19:75:528:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of these regulations. Then,  we use the residuals  from    this regression, which should be a more 
32:1044:85308:19:19:75:528:575:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exogenous measure of changes in FX regulations, as the explanatory variable in our baseline

32:1050:85685:18:19:75:538:463:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:sources.38 The results in columns (1) through (4) suggest that stronger GDP growth, domestic 
32:1051:85778:19:19:75:538:444:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:credit  growth,  house  price  growth,  increased  financial  openness,  greater  use  of  non-FX 
32:1052:85876:19:19:75:537:425:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations, and    faster expected GDP growth over the next year are all positively associated with 
32:1053:85977:19:18:75:538:406:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:increases in FX regulations. Each of these variables usually has the expected sign, but most are 
32:1054:86073:18:19:75:537:388:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:not individually significant. This captures the well-known challenge of predicting exactly when 
32:1055:86169:19:19:75:537:369:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential regulations are adjusted. The one exception is the coefficient on exchange rate 
32:1056:86265:19:19:75:537:350:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:appreciation, which suggests that larger appreciations consistently correspond to increases in 
32:1057:86360:19:18:75:537:331:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations. Columns (5) and (6) also add lagged values of the dependent 
32:1058:86452:18:19:75:547:313:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:variables from our baseline analysis in order to   remove any impact of any trends in these 
32:1059:86544:19:31:75:374:294:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:variables that could be driving the variation in FX regulation. 
32:1060:86608:31:19:102:528:263:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Next , we use the residuals from the six different specifications  in  Table 4a as more

32:1065:87065:19:18:76:528:169:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations correspond to a significant increase in the level and share of cross-border FX loans

32:1067:87257:19:36:76:529:132:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporates. The results are also   usually robust across the six different specifications using

32:1070:87520:13:0:70:451:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:prudential regulations more broadly, including Cerutti et al. ( 2015) and Cerutti et al. (201  7).

33:1079:88324:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:when the variables are not financially weighted (as discussed in Section III). Then we drop

33:1084:88788:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:our main hypotheses. Tighter FX regulation of banks is correlated with banks borrowing less

33:1087:89075:19:30:75:471:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:from banks, with no significant effect on firms’ and banks’ non-FX debt issuance.

33:1092:89518:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:investors.  This  “shifting  snowbank”  is  only  partial,  as  the  reduction  in  international  FX 
33:1093:89620:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing by banks is larger as a percent of GDP than the estimated increase in FX debt

34:1119:91767:19:19:75:528:408:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:movements.  As  discussed  in  the  introduction,  there  is  longstanding  evidence  of  the 
34:1120:91861:19:19:75:528:389:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:multifaceted  risks  and  challenges  created  by  exposure  to  currency  movements.  If 
34:1121:91951:19:18:75:528:370:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations can mitigate these challenges and risks, they could provide

35:1163:95540:12:11:70:541:146:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:(which is largely banks) to proxy for bank returns, and we use the overall stock return index (which includes corporates, 
35:1164:95662:11:10:70:541:135:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:banks, and non-bank financial institutions) to proxy for corporate returns. To better isolate corporate returns from this 
35:1165:95784:10:8:70:459:125:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:broad index, we also construct a  series of corporate stock returns. The key results are unchanged.  
35:1166:95884:8:12:70:537:117:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:43 In equation (17), fxmi,t is measured as the sum of the contemporaneous value of the FX measure plus its three lags.

36:1174:96763:19:31:75:466:650:116:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:would expect the coefficient μ to be more negative for banks than for corporates.

36:1191:98225:19:30:75:499:295:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:currency appreciation corresponds to higher stock returns (as predicted in the model).

37:1208:99797:19:19:75:532:638:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of these effects. Focusing on the columns with the full set of controls in  columns (3) and (4), 
37:1209:99894:19:18:75:528:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:when the cumulated   measures of macroprudential FX regulation is neutral, a 1 percentage 
37:1210:99984:18:19:75:528:601:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:point  depreciation  in the  financially-weighted  exchange  rate  leads  to  a  decrease  in stock 
37:1211:100084:19:19:75:528:582:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:market returns for financials by 1.46 percentage points and for the broad market by 1.18 
37:1212:100173:19:19:75:534:563:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:per centage points. When FX regulations are tightened, the same depreciation corresponds to 
37:1213:100265:19:18:75:528:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:a 0.67 percentage point decline in returns for financials and 0.75 percentage point decline for 
37:1214:100361:18:19:75:528:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the broader market. Hence, tighter macroprudential FX regulations reduce the sensitivity of 
37:1215:100453:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:stock returns to exchange rate shocks for both banks and the broader economy, but the effect 
37:1216:100546:19:31:75:407:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:is  almost twice as large    for banks (and insignificant for corporates).  
37:1217:100622:31:18:102:528:457:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Next, since     the broad market index is only a rough proxy for corporate stock returns (as 
37:1218:100715:18:19:75:529:439:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:this   includes banks as well as non-bank financial institutions), column (5) shows results when 
37:1219:100812:19:19:75:533:420:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:an artificially-constructed measure of corporate stock returns  is used instead of the broad 
37:1220:100905:19:19:75:534:401:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:market index. This proxy is calculated by regressing the broad market return index on  the 
37:1221:100996:19:18:75:528:382:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:financial  return  index  and  taking  the  residual. This  should  better  isolate  the  impact  on 
37:1222:101097:18:19:75:528:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:corporate returns—but should be interpreted cautiously as this regression could also remove 
37:1223:101189:19:19:75:528:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the effects of any omitted variables that affect both corporate and financial stock returns. With 
37:1224:101287:19:19:75:528:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:this  caveat,  the  estimates  support  the  model’s  predictions  that  FX  macroprudential 
37:1225:101380:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations reduce corporate sensitivity to exchange rate movements by less than that for 
37:1226:101470:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks. More specifically, the coefficient on the interaction term between FX regulation and 
37:1227:101562:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:the exchange rate is insignificant and positive—a sharp contrast to the negative and significant 
37:1228:101659:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient for the financial index, as well as to the negative and sometimes weakly significant 
37:1229:101756:19:18:75:528:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:coefficient for the broad index. Since the coefficient estimate is insignificant, we are cautious 
37:1230:101854:18:19:75:528:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:about interpreting the sign of the effect on corporates—but instead can conclude that this 
37:1231:101945:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:result suggests any effect of macroprudential regulations on the sensitivity of corporates to 
37:1232:102039:19:40:75:339:176:122:g_d0_f2:116:g_d0_f2:B:exchange rate movements is small and insignificant.47

37:1234:102147:8:13:70:537:128:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:47 It is also possible, however, that these estimates understate the reduction in FX exposure due to the differential 
37:1235:102265:13:10:70:536:115:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:impact  on  small  firms.  More  specifically,  smaller  firms  are  more  likely  to  rely  on  banks  for  funding,  and  if  FX 
37:1236:102396:10:11:70:537:105:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:regulations cause banks to reduce their FX   lending to these smaller firms, these firms may be unable to issue debt on 
37:1237:102516:11:10:70:535:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:international markets. These smaller firms would therefore be forced to reduce their FX borrowing and exposure—
37:1238:102627:10:10:70:536:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:whether by shifting to local currency borrowing or not borrowing at all. These effects would not be captured in the 
37:1239:102743:10:0:70:495:74:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:?:empirical analysis as these smaller firms are also less likely to be included as part as the main equity index. 
38:1240:102858:0:18:102:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:The  final four columns  of  Table 5   further  explore  this  relationship between

38:1244:103215:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:for larger exchange rate movements. An extensive literature focuses on the greater sensitivity

38:1248:103592:19:18:75:547:556:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:suggested that the impact of exchange rate movements on the economy may be non-   linear 
38:1249:103681:18:19:75:544:538:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and greater after large movements, especially depreciations (e.g. ,  Kappler et al. 2013  )— so

38:1253:104059:18:19:75:528:463:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:but the estimated magnitudes of the coefficients are all larger. For example, and most relevant

38:1262:104875:19:19:75:528:282:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:exchange rate movements (corresponding to the collapse of Lehman Brothers). We have also 
38:1263:104964:19:19:75:528:263:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:repeated the analysis using dollar exchange rates (instead of financial-exposure weighted

38:1267:105330:19:19:75:528:175:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:movements. The sensitivity of stock returns for the broader economy may also be reduced, but

39:1272:105739:0:18:84:538:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:how    does  this  occur?  This  section  provides  some  initial  evidence,  focusing  on  the key 
39:1273:105839:18:19:84:558:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:mechanisms  suggested in the theoretical model and    for which data for our cross   -section of 
39:1274:105936:19:19:84:538:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:countries (particularly emerging markets) is available. Specifically, Section II.C. highlights 
39:1275:106030:19:32:84:491:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:three channels through which FX regulations could affect banks’ lending outcomes: 
39:1276:106111:32:18:107:550:618:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:?:• The lending rate that banks charge to their customers increases, due   to the tax from 
39:1277:106199:18:20:85:169:600:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:the regulations . 
39:1278:106217:20:19:107:538:580:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:?:• The   number of firms that borrow from banks declines, because the associated rise in 
39:1279:106304:19:19:85:536:561:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:borrowing costs forces low productivity firms to shift from bank funding to investor funding. 
39:1280:106398:19:19:107:538:542:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f2:?:• The share of non-performing bank loans falls, because low productivity firms borrow 
39:1281:106483:19:31:85:444:523:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:less from banks, thereby reducing banks’ shares of low-quality borrowers.

39:1286:106933:19:31:84:474:417:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:financial cycle (captured by real GDP growth and credit growth, respectively).

39:1288:107098:18:19:84:537:368:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:banks’ risk-adjusted lending rate.  Both  coefficients on the FX measures are positive and 
39:1289:107189:19:19:84:538:349:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:significant (at least at the 10% level), as expected; a tightening of FX regulations makes lending 
39:1290:107288:19:19:84:537:330:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:more expensive and increases the lending rate that banks charge to their customers. Next,

39:1294:107660:19:19:84:538:255:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:performing loans. Both    coefficients on FX regulations are again negative, as expected, and 
39:1295:107754:19:18:84:552:236:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:significant (at least at the 10% level). This supports the prediction that tighter FX   regulations 
39:1296:107854:18:31:84:295:218:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:reduce the  share of non-performing loans.

39:1299:108076:19:18:84:538:149:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:also provide additional support for how    these regulations could reduce bank sensitivity to 
39:1300:108170:18:25:84:538:131:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:currency movements—by reducing the share of loans made to the low productivity firms that

40:1311:108889:31:19:102:528:558:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:A growing literature is beginning to document how macroprudential tools can improve

40:1313:109069:19:18:75:528:520:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:also  beginning  to  document  how  these  tools  often  have  unintended  consequences.  One 
40:1314:109163:18:19:75:540:502:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential tool which is be  coming more widely utilized, but has   received relatively less

40:1316:109353:19:31:75:519:464:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:evidence that foreign currency exposure can generate important economic vulnerabilities .  
40:1317:109444:31:18:102:528:433:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:This  paper  attempts  to  address  this  gap  by  analyzing  the  incidence  and  impact  of 
40:1318:109538:18:19:75:528:415:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:macroprudential FX regulations. It develops the key concepts in a theoretical model, compiles 
40:1319:109632:19:19:75:528:396:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:a dataset with detailed information on these regulations over time, and then uses it to test the 
40:1320:109729:19:19:75:528:377:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:predictions of the model. The results show that after an increase in macroprudential FX 
40:1321:109817:19:18:75:528:358:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:regulations: (1) banks borrow and lend less in foreign currency (with no change in their 
40:1322:109906:18:19:75:535:340:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing in local currency); (2) firms shift    away from bank FX  borrowing and increase their 
40:1323:110003:19:19:75:528:321:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:FX borrowing from market investors (with no increase in firm and bank non-FX borrowing 
40:1324:110090:19:19:75:528:302:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:from  investors);  (3)  banks  are  less  exposed  to  exchange  rate  movements;  and  (4)  firms 
40:1325:110189:19:18:75:528:283:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:experience some reduction in their exposure to exchange rate movements, but less than for 
40:1326:110279:18:19:75:528:265:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks. Each of these results supports the main predictions of the model. This combination of 
40:1327:110372:19:19:75:528:246:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:results suggests that even if macroprudential FX regulations on banks accomplish their direct 
40:1328:110466:19:19:75:528:227:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:goals and significantly  reduc   e  bank vulnerability to currency movements, they also generate 
40:1329:110563:19:18:75:535:208:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:meaningful leakages and partially “shift the snowbanks” of FX  vulnerability to other sectors 
40:1330:110657:18:31:75:156:190:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:of the economy. 
40:1331:110672:31:19:102:528:159:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Although these empirical results are robust to a number of extensions and sensitivity 
40:1332:110758:19:19:75:528:140:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:tests, several caveats are important. The underlying data on foreign currency borrowing may 
40:1333:110850:19:18:75:528:121:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:miss important aspects of bank and firm FX exposures. For example, the data includes limited 
40:1334:110942:18:19:75:528:103:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:information on firm or bank exposure to foreign currency that occurs without crossing borders 
40:1335:111036:19:0:75:528:84:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:(such as if a local household makes a bank deposit in foreign currency). The data also does not 
41:1336:111136:0:18:75:528:706:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:incorporate any transactions or changes in exposure that occur entirely through trading or 
41:1337:111227:18:19:75:532:688:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:lending in a third country (as often occurs in financial centers).  Moreover, the analysis does 
41:1338:111323:19:19:75:528:669:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:not include information on hedging—whether natural or in financial markets—which could 
41:1339:111410:19:19:75:528:650:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:reduce an entity’s  vulnerability to currency movements even if it has large gross FX positions. 
41:1340:111507:19:18:75:528:631:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Many of these data challenges, however, might be expected to bias estimates toward zero, 
41:1341:111596:18:19:75:528:613:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:thereby suggesting some of the effects estimated in the paper could actually be larger if better 
41:1342:111693:19:19:75:528:594:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:data existed. For example, if firms respond to tighter FX regulations at home by issuing FX 
41:1343:111785:19:19:75:548:575:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:debt abroad and selling it to a foreigner ( with    the entire transaction in London),    this leakage 
41:1344:111888:19:30:75:263:556:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:would not be captured in our analysis. 
41:1345:111926:30:19:102:526:526:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:Another important caveat is that the analysis in this paper does not provide a full cost-
41:1346:112015:19:19:75:528:507:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:benefit calculation of the impact of macroprudential regulations—either in the theoretical 
41:1347:112106:19:19:75:528:488:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:model or the empirical analysis. Macroprudential regulations can have much broader costs 
41:1348:112195:19:18:75:529:469:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and benefits than those explored in this paper—such as on the distortions created as firms, 
41:1349:112287:18:19:75:528:451:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:banks and individuals find other ways to reduce the impact of the regulations (perhaps by 
41:1350:112376:19:19:75:528:432:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:shifting business to other countries with a different regulatory framework). A full test of these 
41:1351:112474:19:19:75:528:413:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:various effects is beyond the scope of this paper—but would be a promising avenue for future 
41:1352:112567:19:30:75:388:394:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:work (with datasets better targeted to address these questions).  
41:1353:112632:30:19:102:529:364:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:A:With  these  caveats,  the  results in  this  paper have  important  implications  for  the 
41:1354:112724:19:19:75:529:345:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:application  of  macroprudential  policy. One   key  implication  is  for  the  debate  on  capital 
41:1355:112824:19:19:75:529:326:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:controls versus macroprudential policy. Countries concerned about excessive borrowing in 
41:1356:112913:19:18:75:528:307:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:foreign currency may consider capital controls (especially for bank borrowing in FX, which is 
41:1357:113007:18:19:75:528:289:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:particularly volatile and linked to booms and busts50). Macroprudential regulations on banks, 
41:1358:113101:19:19:75:528:270:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:however, appear to be effective in reducing this vulnerability in the financial system without 
41:1359:113196:19:19:75:528:251:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:resorting to capital controls—controls which are illegal in some contexts (such as for EU 
41:1360:113286:19:18:75:552:232:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:members and in some trade agreements). A  lthough macroprudential bank     regulations can 
41:1361:113377:18:19:75:532:214:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:also    generate leakages (such as an increase in FX debt issuance by corporates),  capital controls 
41:1362:113478:19:19:75:528:195:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:can also generate costs    and unintended consequences—including other ways of “shifting the

41:1366:113721:10:13:70:532:107:36:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:51 For example, Keller (2018) shows that capital controls can cause banks to increase FX lending to domestic firms 
41:1367:113836:13:10:70:532:94:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:(in order to better hedge their foreign currency deposits when international hedging becomes more expensive), 
41:1368:113946:10:10:70:532:84:81:g_d0_f2:81:g_d0_f2:F:thereby causing an increase in the  foreign currency exposure of domestic companies. For other evidence on the costs

42:1374:114407:19:18:75:525:619:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:Our results suggest that macroprudential FX regulations can reduce risks in a systemically-

42:1378:114774:19:20:75:529:544:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:and/or  less  able  to  manage  exchange  rate  movements  than  banks? Do the  regulations 
42:1379:114866:20:19:75:534:524:122:g_d0_f2:122:g_d0_f2:B:generate other costs, such as by  reducing output due to the less efficient allocation of FX
