2:27:1230:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We explore the interrelationships between various measures of cultural distance. We first discuss measures
2:28:1336:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:of genetic distance, used in the recent economics literature to capture the degree of relatedness between
2:29:1441:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:countries. We next describe several classes of measures of linguistic, religious, and cultural distances.
2:30:1546:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:We introduce new measures of cultural distance based on differences in average answers to questions
2:31:1645:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:from the World Values Survey. Using a simple theoretical model we hypothesize that ancestral distance,
2:32:1747:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:measured by genetic distance, is positively correlated with linguistic, religious, and cultural distance.
2:33:1852:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:An empirical exploration of these correlations shows this to be the case. This empirical evidence is
2:34:1952:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:consistent with the view that genetic distance is a summary statistic for a wide array of cultural traits
2:35:2057:14:42:72:223:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:transmitted intergenerationally.

3:51:2368:0:31:72:185:708:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:52:2383:31:21:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Populations that share a more recent common ancestry exchange goods, capital, innovations and
3:53:2476:21:20:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technologies more intensively, but they also tend to Öght more with each other.1Why does ancestral
3:54:2574:20:20:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance matter for these outcomes? In this paper, we argue that when populations split apart and
3:55:2671:20:21:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:diverge over the long span of history, their cultural traits also diverge. These cultural traits include
3:56:2775:21:20:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:language and religion but also a broader set of norms, values and attitudes that are transmitted
3:57:2871:20:20:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intergenerationally and therefore display persistence over long stretches of time.  In turn, these
3:58:2969:20:21:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:traits introduce barriers to interactions and communication between societies, in proportion to how
3:59:3068:21:26:72:252:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:far they have drifted from each other.
3:60:3106:26:20:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the rate at which languages, religions and values diverged from each other over time varies
3:61:3203:20:21:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across speciÖc traits, we hypothesize and document a signiÖcant positive relationship between
3:62:3296:21:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long-term relatedness between populations, measured by genetic distance, and a wide array of
3:63:3388:20:20:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measures of cultural di§erences. In doing so, we provide support for the argument that the e§ect
3:64:3484:20:21:72:540:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of genealogical relatedness on economic and political outcomes captures at least in part the e§ects
3:65:3583:21:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of cultural distance. In sum, genetic relatedness is a summary statistic for a wide array of cultural
3:66:3684:20:20:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:traits transmitted vertically across generations. These di§erences in vertically transmitted traits
3:67:3783:20:27:72:320:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:introduce horizontal barriers to human interactions.
3:68:3835:27:20:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We begin our paper with a general discussion of measures of ancestral distance.  We focus
3:69:3924:20:20:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on genetic distance, a measure that has been used in a recent emerging literature on the deep
3:70:4017:20:21:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:roots of economic development. This measure captures how distant human societies are in terms
3:71:4110:21:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the frequency of neutral genes among them.  It constitutes a molecular clock that allows us
3:72:4204:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to characterize the degree of relatedness between human populations in terms of the number of
3:73:4297:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generations that separate them from a common ancestor population. We next turn to measures
3:74:4387:21:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of cultural di§erences. We consider three classes of such measures. The Örst is linguistic distance.
3:75:4487:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Since these measures are described in great detail elsewhere, we keep our discussion brief.2The
3:76:4582:20:23:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:second class of measures is religious distance. We adopt an approach based on religious trees to

3:79:4907:16:17:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and cultural distance is vast. Salient references include Melitz (2008), Melitz and Toubal (2012), Guiso, Sapienza

4:82:5116:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characterize the distance between major world religions, and use these distances to calculate the
4:83:5213:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:religious distance between countries. Third, in the newest part of this paper, we deÖne and compute
4:84:5312:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a series of measures of di§erences in values, norms and attitudes between countries, based on the
4:85:5409:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:World Values Survey. We show that these classes of measures are positively correlated between
4:86:5502:21:20:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:each other, yet the correlations among them are not large. This motivates the quest for a summary
4:87:5599:20:26:72:220:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measure of cultural di§erences.
4:88:5630:26:21:88:539:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We next argue that genetic distance is such a summary measure. We start with a simple model
4:89:5721:21:20:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linking genetic distance to cultural distance, providing a conceptual foundation for studying the
4:90:5818:20:20:72:540:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between relatedness and cultural distance.  The model shows that if cultural traits
4:91:5914:20:21:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are transmitted from parents to children with variation, then a greater ancestral distance between
4:92:6012:21:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:populations should on average be related with greater cultural distance. This relationship holds
4:93:6108:20:20:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in expectations and not necessarily in each speciÖc case (it is possible for two genealogically dis-
4:94:6208:20:21:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tant populations to end up with similar cultural traits), but our framework predicts a positive
4:95:6303:21:20:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relationship between genetic distance and cultural distance. We next investigate empirically the
4:96:6399:20:20:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:links between genetic distance and the aforementioned metrics of cultural distance, shedding some
4:97:6496:20:20:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:light on their complex interrelationships. We Önd that genetic distance is positively correlated with
4:98:6597:20:21:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linguistic and religious distance as well as with di§erences in values and attitudes across countries,
4:99:6699:21:20:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and is therefore a plausible measure of the average distance between countries along these various
4:100:6797:20:26:72:161:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dimensions jointly.

5:141:10446:26:21:88:539:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 addresses the measurement of ancestry using
5:142:10536:21:22:71:539:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:genetic distance. Section 3 discusses the constructions of each of our three classes of distances:

6:144:10744:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linguistic, religious and values / norms / attitudes distances. Section 4 presents a simple theoretical

6:146:10944:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlations, both simple and partial, between genetic distance and cultural distance. Section 6
6:147:11040:20:44:72:121:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concludes.

6:149:11061:31:28:72:355:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:2.1  Ancestry, relatedness, and genetic markers
6:150:11108:28:20:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Who is related to whom? The biological foundation of relatedness is ancestry: two individuals are
6:151:11205:20:20:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:biologically related when one is the ancestor of the other, or both have common ancestors. Siblings
6:152:11304:20:21:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are more closely related than Örst cousins because they have more recent common ancestors: their
6:153:11400:21:20:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parents, rather than their grandparents. It is well known that genetic information can shed light
6:154:11497:20:20:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on relatedness and common ancestry at the individual level. People inherit their DNA from their
6:155:11592:20:21:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parents, and contemporary DNA testing can assess paternity and maternity with great accuracy.
6:156:11685:21:20:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:By the same token, genetic information can help reconstruct the relations between individuals and
6:157:11782:20:26:72:370:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups who share common ancestors much farther in the past.
6:158:11841:26:21:88:539:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:From a long-term perspective, all humans are relatively close cousins, as we all descend from a
6:159:11936:21:20:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:small number of members of the speciesHomo sapiens, originating in Africa over 100,000 years ago.
6:160:12033:20:20:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As humans moved to di§erent regions and continents, they separated into di§erent populations.
6:161:12126:20:21:72:540:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Genetic information about current populations allows us to infer the relations among them and
6:162:12219:21:20:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the overall history of humankind. Typically, people all over the world tend to share the same set
6:163:12316:20:20:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of gene variants (alleles), but with di§erent frequencies across di§erent populations. Historically,
6:164:12416:20:21:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this was Örst noticed with respect to blood groups. The four main blood groups are A, B, AB and
6:165:12511:21:20:72:540:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:O, and are the same across di§erent populations. These observable groups (phenotypes) are the
6:166:12604:20:20:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outcome of genetic transmission, involving three di§erent variants (alleles) of the same gene: A, B,
6:167:12704:20:21:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and O. Each individual receives one allele from each parent. For instance, A-group people may be
6:168:12800:21:20:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so because they have received two copies of allele A (homozygotes) or because they have received
6:169:12896:20:20:72:540:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a copy of allele A and one of allele O (heterozygotes). In contrast, O-group people can only be
6:170:12991:20:20:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:homozygotes (two O alleles), and AB-group can only have an A from a parent and a B from the
6:171:13082:20:27:72:134:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other parent.
6:172:13095:27:0:88:539:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:By observing ABO blood groups, it is possible to infer the distribution of di§erent alleles (A,
7:173:13191:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:B and O) in a given population.  The frequencies of such alleles vary across populations. For
7:174:13284:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example, one of the earliest studies of blood group di§erences across ethnic groups, conducted
7:175:13378:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the beginning of the 20th century and cited in Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza (1994, p.
7:176:13472:20:21:72:539:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:18) found that the proportions of A and B alleles among the English were46:4percent and10:2
7:177:13563:21:20:71:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent respectively, were45:6percent and14:2percent among the French, while these proportions
7:178:13657:20:20:71:540:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were44:6percent and25:2percent among the Turks and30:7percent and28:2percent among the
7:179:13743:20:21:71:539:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Malagasy. It is reasonably to assume that these gene frequencies have varied mostly randomly over
7:180:13840:21:20:71:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time, as an e§ect ofgenetic drift, the random changes in allele frequency from one generation to the
7:181:13940:20:20:71:539:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:next due to the Önite sampling of which speciÖc individuals and alleles end up contributing to the
7:182:14038:20:21:71:539:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:next generation. Under random drift, it is unlikely that the French and the English have ended up
7:183:14135:21:20:71:539:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with similar distributions of those alleles just out of chance, and more likely that their distributions
7:184:14239:20:20:71:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are similar because they share recent common ancestors. That is, they used to be part of the same
7:185:14336:20:21:71:539:464:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:population in relatively recent times. In contrast, the English and the Turks are likely to share
7:186:14433:21:20:71:539:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:common ancestors farther in the past, and the English and the Malagasys even farther down the
7:187:14526:20:26:71:128:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generations.
7:188:14538:26:20:88:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Genetic information about ABO blood groups alone would be insu¢ cient to determine the
7:189:14624:20:21:71:539:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relationships among di§erent populations.  More information can be obtained by considering a
7:190:14716:21:20:71:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:larger range ofgenetic markers, that is, genes that change across individuals, and are therefore
7:191:14812:20:20:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:useful to study their ancestry and relatedness. Blood groups belong to a larger set of classic genetic
7:192:14914:20:21:71:539:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:markers, which also include other blood-group systems (such as the RH and MN blood groups),
7:193:15005:21:20:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variants of immunoglobulin (GM, KM, AM, etc.), variants of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA)
7:194:15095:20:26:71:120:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and so on.
7:195:15105:26:21:88:539:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:By considering a large number of classic genetic markers, pioneers in this area of human ge-
7:196:15197:21:20:71:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:netics, such as Cavalli-Sforza and his collaborators (e.g., see Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1964;
7:197:15294:20:20:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza, 1994) were able to measure global genetic di§erences across
7:198:15389:20:21:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:populations, and to use such measures to infer how di§erent populations have separated from each
7:199:15485:21:20:71:539:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other over time and space. More recently, the great advances in DNA sequencing have allowed the
7:200:15580:20:20:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:direct study ofpolymorphisms(that is, genetic information that di§ers across individuals) at the
7:201:15676:20:21:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:molecular level. In particular, human genetic di§erences can now be studied directly by looking
7:202:15771:21:20:71:539:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at instances ofSingle Nucleotide Polymorphismor SNP (pronounced snip), a sequence variation

11:354:23060:21:20:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994, Figure 2.3.2B, p. 78), is a phylogenetic tree, constructed from
11:355:23157:20:20:71:539:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:genetic distance data, that visually shows how di§erent human populations have split apart over
11:356:23252:20:20:71:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time. The phylogenetic tree is constructed to maximize the correlation between Euclidian distances
11:357:23350:20:21:71:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to common nodes (measured along the branches) andFSTgenetic distance computed from allele
11:358:23439:21:20:71:539:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:frequencies. Hence, the tree is a simpliÖed summary of (but not a substitute for) the matrix of
11:359:23534:20:20:71:540:336:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:FSTgenetic distances between populations. Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994) also calculated estimates
11:360:23630:20:21:71:538:316:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f6:B:of Neiís distance, which is a di§erent measure of genetic distance between populations. WhileFST
11:361:23726:21:20:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Neiís distance have di§erent analytical deÖnitions and theoretical properties, they capture the
11:362:23825:20:20:71:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same basic relationships, and their correlation is93:9percent. Therefore, in the rest of this paper
11:363:23924:20:27:71:199:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we only useFSTmeasures.
11:364:23947:27:20:88:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994) provide genetic distance data at the population level, not at the
11:365:24041:20:20:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:country level.  Therefore, economists and other social scientists interested in studying country-
11:366:24138:20:21:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:level data need to match populations to countries. In Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009), we did so
11:367:24231:21:20:71:539:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using ethnic composition data by country from Alesina et al.  (2003), who list1;120country-
11:368:24322:20:20:71:539:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ethnic group categories. We matched ethnic group labels with population labels in Appendices
11:369:24414:20:21:71:539:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2 and 3 from Cavalli-Sforza et al.  (1994).  For instance, according to Alesina et al.  (2003),
11:370:24509:21:20:71:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:India is composed of72percent of ìIndo-Aryansîand25percent ìDravidians.îThese groups were
11:371:24598:20:0:71:539:86:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:matched, respectively, to ìIndiansî and ìDravidhansî (S.E. Indians) from Cavalli-Sforza et al.
12:372:24693:0:21:72:542:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1994).  Another example is Italy, where the ethnic groups labelled ìItaliansî and ìRhaetiansî
12:373:24787:21:20:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(95:4percent of Italyís population) in Alesina et al. (2003) were matched to the genetic category
12:374:24884:20:20:72:539:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìItalianîin Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994), and the ìSardiniansîethnic group (2:7percent of Italyís
12:375:24981:20:27:72:355:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:population) was matched to the ìSardinianîgenetic group.
12:376:25037:27:20:88:539:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Using these matching rules, we constructed two measures ofFSTgenetic distance between
12:377:25122:20:20:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:countries.9The Örst was the distance between the plurality ethnic groups of each country in a pair,
12:378:25221:20:21:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:i.e. the groups with the largest shares of each countryís population. For instance, the plurality
12:379:25318:21:20:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:genetic distance between India and Italy is the genetic distance between the Indian genetic group
12:380:25415:20:20:72:539:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the Italian genetic group (FST= 0:026). This resulted in a dataset of21;321pairs of countries
12:381:25512:20:21:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(207underlying countries and dependencies) with available genetic distance data.10The second
12:382:25604:21:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was a measure of weighted genetic distance. Many countries, such as the United States or Australia,
12:383:25703:20:20:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are made up of sub-populations that are genetically distant, and for which both genetic distance
12:384:25799:20:21:72:539:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data and data on the shares of each genetic group are available. Assume that country1contains

12:386:25981:20:20:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:populationiin country1(similarly for country2) anddijthe genetic distance between populations
12:387:26074:20:34:72:446:397:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:iandj. The weightedFSTgenetic distance between countries1and2is then:
12:388:26143:34:0:234:264:363:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:?:FWST=

12:394:26175:36:20:71:539:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The interpretation of this measure is straightforward: it represents the expected genetic distance
12:395:26273:20:22:71:540:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between two randomly selected individuals, one from each country.11Weighted genetic distance
12:396:26365:22:21:84:539:285:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:9We also constructed genetic distance for populations as they were in 1500, based again on data from Cavalli-Sforza
12:397:26480:21:16:72:540:264:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:et al. (1994). For this variable, for instance, the United States is matched to the North Amerindian population. This
12:398:26597:16:17:72:539:248:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:measure of genetic distance in1500can either be used as an instrument for contemporary genetic distance (Spolaore
12:399:26710:17:16:72:540:231:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:and Wacziarg, 2009), or as an independent variable in applications that seek to explain pre-Industrial economic
12:400:26821:16:16:72:540:215:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:outcomes (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2013). However we do not make use of this variable in this paper, since we focus
12:401:26934:16:16:72:330:199:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:on the contemporary relationship between ancestry and culture.
12:402:26996:16:20:80:539:183:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:10For27countries, the data on group shares was missing from Alesina et al.ís (2003) database, but a match to
12:403:27104:20:16:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:genetic groups based on plurality groups was possible through information fromEncyclopedia Britannica. Thus, our
12:404:27216:16:17:72:539:147:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:weighted measure of genetic distance covers16;110pairs, or180countries, whereas for the plurality match we have
12:405:27327:17:15:72:236:130:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:data on21;321pairs from207countries.
12:406:27363:15:20:80:539:115:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:11Therefore, the weighted measure is not to be interpreted asFSTgenetic distance between thewholepopulation
12:407:27470:20:17:72:540:95:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of a country (say, all Australians) and thewholepopulation of another country (say, all Americans), as if each
12:408:27580:17:0:72:539:78:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:country were formed by one randomly-mating population (ademe).  Instead, to each pair of individuals in each
13:409:27690:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:is very highly correlated with genetic distance based on dominant groups: the correlation is93
13:410:27784:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent. In the rest of this paper we will mostly use weightedFSTdistance, which is a more precise
13:411:27882:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:measure of expected genetic distance between countries. Table 1 presents summary statistics for
13:412:27977:20:44:72:138:647:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:FSTandFWST.
13:413:27988:44:31:72:151:603:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3  Culture
13:414:27998:31:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To capture cultural distance we adopt a three-pronged approach. We Örst focus on a salient dimen-
13:415:28095:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sion of culture, language, likely to be strongly related with genetic distance because language, like
13:416:28196:20:21:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:genes, is transmitted from parents to children within populations, and because linguistic di§erenti-
13:417:28296:21:20:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ation, like genetic di§erentiation, results over time from horizontal separation between populations.
13:418:28397:20:20:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Religion is another salient characteristic of human societies, also transmitted intergenerationally
13:419:28496:20:21:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with variations. Finally, in the most novel part of this paper we use answers to the World Val-
13:420:28591:21:20:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ues Survey to construct broader metrics of distance in values, norms and attitudes. Jointly, these
13:421:28689:20:20:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:three classes of measures are referred to asmemetic distance, by analogy with genetic distance, us-
13:422:28788:20:21:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ing a distinction between culturally transmitted traits (memes) and genetically transmitted traits
13:423:28886:21:20:71:539:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(genes) that goes back to Dawkins (1976).  We describe in turn the methods by which each of
13:424:28977:20:20:71:539:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these measures were constructed, and provide descriptions of these variables, before turning to
13:425:29072:20:36:71:182:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their interrelationships.
13:426:29097:36:28:71:212:313:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.1  Linguistic distance
13:427:29121:28:20:71:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To capture linguistic distance, we employ two methods, one based onlanguage trees, and the other
13:428:29217:20:21:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based onlexicostatistics. These are arguably the most widely used in the social sciences, but there
13:429:29316:21:26:71:520:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:exist other types of measures of linguistic distance, discussed in Ginsburgh and Weber (2015).

13:435:29920:17:15:72:179:118:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of di§erent genetic groups.

14:441:30367:20:21:72:539:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tance between French and Italian, because Italian shares4nodes with French. Variation in the
14:442:30459:21:20:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of common nodes corresponds to variation in linguistic distance. French and Italian, for
14:443:30554:20:20:72:540:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instance, share no common nodes with non Indo-European languages, and are therefore at a higher
14:444:30649:20:26:72:360:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linguistic distance from them than they are with each other.
14:445:30709:26:20:88:539:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We use data from Fearon (2003), who assembled data on the prevalence of di§erent languages for
14:446:30803:20:21:72:540:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a large set of countries in the world from a variety of sources, and used the linguistic trees provided
14:447:30906:21:20:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Ethnologue to capture the distance between these languages. As we did with genetic distance, we
14:448:31004:20:20:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:compute two di§erent measures: the number of common nodes between the two plurality languages

14:450:31187:21:20:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:latter exploits the fact that countries can be linguistically heterogeneous, and consists of computing

14:470:31987:20:20:72:539:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f5:B:distances can be computed for a wide range of countries: we have12;246observations forTLD

14:472:32164:20:21:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of tree-based measures is that linguistic distance is calculated on a discrete number of common
14:473:32259:21:22:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nodes, which could be an imperfect measure of separation times between languages. A single split

14:475:32465:20:16:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:individuals chosen from each country in a pair, rather from within a single society. See Ginsburgh and Weber (2015)
14:476:32580:16:0:72:244:71:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:for further details on Greenbergís B-index.
15:477:32625:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between two languages that occurred a long time ago would result in the same measure of distance
15:478:32721:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than a more recent single split, but the languages in the Örst case may in fact be more distant than
15:479:32821:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the second. Similarly, numerous recent splits may result in two languages sharing few nodes,
15:480:32916:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:while a smaller number of very distant linguistic subdivisions could make distant languages seem
15:481:33012:21:26:72:379:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:close. This drawback justiÖes looking at an alternative measure.
15:482:33076:26:20:88:539:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This second measure of linguistic distance is based on lexicostatistics, the branch of quantita-
15:483:33172:20:21:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tive linguistics classifying language groups based on whether words used to convey some common
15:484:33266:21:20:72:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:meanings ñsuch as ìmotherîor ìtableîñarecognate, i.e. stem from the same ancestor word. Two
15:485:33357:20:20:71:539:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:languages with many cognate words are linguistically closer than those with non-cognate words.
15:486:33451:20:21:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For instance, the words ìtavolaîin Italian and ìtableîin French both stem from the common Latin
15:487:33546:21:20:71:539:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:term ìtabulaî. They are therefore cognate. Replicating this over a large number of meanings, the
15:488:33642:20:20:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percentage of cognate words is a measure of linguistic proximity. We rely on data from Dyen et al.

15:490:33832:21:20:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the percentage of cognate words: the percentage of cognate words between the plurality languages
15:491:33928:20:20:71:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spoken in each country in a pair,CLD, and the weighted percentage,CLDW, which represents the
15:492:34020:20:20:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expected percentage of cognate words between two individuals randomly chosen from each country
15:493:34114:20:21:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in a pair.14Once again, Table 1 provides summary statistics, showing thatCLDandCLDWvary
15:494:34201:21:26:71:378:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between0and0:92, with the sample mean equal to roughly0:6.
15:495:34259:26:20:88:539:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The big advantage of the lexicostatistical approach is that it approximates linguistic di§erences

15:497:34447:21:20:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:costatistical distance data in the social sciences is Dyen et al. (1992), which we use here. This
15:498:34544:20:20:71:539:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particular source only covers Indo-European languages, and therefore metrics of linguistic distance
15:499:34643:20:21:71:539:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are only available for country pairs where these languages are spoken. However, new data from
15:500:34736:21:23:71:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP), combining lexicostatistical methods with

15:503:35042:16:16:72:455:169:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:have63underlying countries (1;953pairs) forCLDWand85countries (3;570pairs) forCLD.
15:504:35124:16:20:80:539:153:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:15Under the assumption that linguistic drift is constant across languages, i.e. that the rate of linguistic innovation
15:505:35242:20:16:72:540:133:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:over time is similar across languages, lexicostatistical distance can be argued to be correlated with separation times
15:506:35360:16:17:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:between languages.  This insight gave rise to the Öeld ofglottochronology,the attempt to back out the dates of
15:507:35470:17:16:72:540:100:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:separation of population based on linguistic similarities between them. The assumption of common linguistic drift
15:508:35583:16:0:72:176:84:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:has been heavily debated.

16:510:35708:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of languages (Ginsburgh and Weber, 2015, provide further references and details on this recent

16:516:36247:21:20:72:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:highly correlated. The correlation between the two weighted measures is0:82, while the correlation
16:517:36345:20:36:71:257:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the plurality measures is0:78.

16:519:36406:27:21:71:539:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To capture religious distance between countries, we adopt an approach analogous to the tree-based
16:520:36503:21:20:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linguistic distance. We consider trees that describe the relationship between world religions. One
16:521:36601:20:20:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such tree is from Mecham, Fearon and Laitin (2006), displayed in Figure 2, and another is from the
16:522:36699:20:21:71:539:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:World Christian Database (2007, henceforth WCD), displayed in Figure 3. We make use of both
16:523:36790:21:26:71:235:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the empirical work that follows.
16:524:36825:26:20:88:539:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The trees consist of grouping religions into broad categories.  For instance, ìNear-Eastern
16:525:36916:20:21:71:539:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Monotheistic Religionsîis one broad category common to both trees we use. These broad categories
16:526:37012:21:20:71:539:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are further divided into Öner classiÖcations. For instance Near Eastern monotheistic religions are
16:527:37110:20:20:71:539:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subdivided into Christianity, Islam and Judaism. These are further reÖned into yet greater levels
16:528:37207:20:21:71:539:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of disaggregation. The number of common nodes between religions is a metric of religious prox-
16:529:37301:21:20:71:539:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:imity. For instance Lutherans are closer in religious space to Baptists than they are to the Greek
16:530:37399:20:26:71:120:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Orthodox.
16:531:37408:26:21:88:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the Mecham, Fearon and Laitin dataset there can be up to5common nodes between re-
16:532:37492:21:20:72:539:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ligions, while the WCD data is less Önely disaggregated, so there can be up to3common nodes
16:533:37583:20:20:72:539:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:only.16Each source provides data on the frequency of each religion in each country, so distances
16:534:37679:20:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between religions can be mapped to religious distance between countries. As before, we calculate
16:535:37775:21:20:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the number of common nodes between the plurality religions of each country in a pair, as well as
16:536:37871:20:23:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the expected number of common nodes (following a formula analogous to equation 15). Finally, to
16:537:37966:23:20:80:539:95:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:16Due to its Öner level of disaggregation the Fearon, Mecham and Laitin classiÖcation and data is preferred. However
16:538:38082:20:0:72:402:75:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:for the sake of completeness we present results pertaining to both datasets below.
17:539:38166:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtain measures of religious distance, we implement a transformation analogous to that in equation
17:540:38264:21:36:72:438:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(16). Summary statistics for the4resulting metrics are displayed in Table 1.

17:542:38395:27:21:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Answers to questions from social surveys can be used as indicators of a respondentís cultural norms,
17:543:38495:21:20:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:values and attitudes. By analogy with genetics, questions correspond togene lociwhile the speciÖc
17:544:38592:20:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:answers given are thealleles.  Di§erences across populations in the answer shares to a speciÖc
17:545:38686:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:question can be used to calculate the cultural distance between countries on that speciÖc question.
17:546:38785:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, aggregating over questions allows the computation of indices of cultural distance in values,

17:548:38912:26:20:88:539:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There are three major challenges when computing these indices.  The Örst challenge is the
17:549:39001:20:21:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:choice of questions. Rather than choosing questions arbitrarily, which would be open to criticism,
17:550:39099:21:20:72:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we consider the set ofallvalues-related questions appearing in the World Values Survey 1981-
17:551:39191:20:20:72:539:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:2010 Integrated Questionnaire, i.e. those listed by the WVS as categories A through G.17All740
17:552:39285:20:21:71:539:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:questions can be considered when computing distances question by question. When calculating
17:553:39376:21:20:71:539:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:summary indices of cultural distance that aggregate across questions, however, it is important to
17:554:39473:20:20:71:539:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have a sample that is balanced across country pairs, i.e. to have the same number of questions
17:555:39567:20:21:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for each pair. Some of the questions were only asked in a subset of countries, sometimes a small
17:556:39663:21:20:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subset. There is a trade-o§ between maintaining a large set of questions, in which case the number
17:557:39761:20:20:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of country pairs shrinks, or maintaining a broad sample of country pairs, in which case the set of
17:558:39859:20:21:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:questions is reduced. In what follows we chose to do the latter, to maximize the representativeness
17:559:39958:21:20:71:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the sample of countries. This led to keeping98questions out of the original set. Data availability
17:560:40059:20:20:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is the only concern that governs which questions remain. Yet since the remaining questions are
17:561:40153:20:21:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those that were asked in the broadest set of countries, they constitute the core questions of the
17:562:40250:21:20:71:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:WVS. Focusing on these questions, that were asked in at least one wave of the WVS in74countries,
17:563:40346:20:22:71:328:191:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:we are left with distances computed for2;701pairs.18
17:564:40398:22:21:80:539:169:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:17These categories are as follows: Category A: Perceptions of Life. Category B: Environment. Category C: Work.

17:567:40730:17:15:72:402:115:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:characteristics of the respondent or characteristics of the survey (wave, year, etc).
17:568:40815:15:20:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:18We also implemented di§erent choices in terms of the mix of country pairs and questions, increasing the number
17:569:40927:20:0:72:540:80:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of questions at the cost of losing some country pairs, leading to no appreciable change in the results. These results
18:570:41046:0:21:88:539:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The second challenge is the choice of a functional form for computing distances for each question.
18:571:41144:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There are many possible choices, but we focus on the simplest one, which is to calculate the
18:572:41236:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Euclidian distance. In further empirical work that is available in the online appendix, we used
18:573:41331:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Manhattan andFSTcultural distances instead of Euclidian distance, Önding results that are very
18:574:41425:21:20:71:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:similar to those reported here.19Consider countries1and2and questionifrom the WVS, which

18:576:41602:20:21:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:answers (J >2).20Letscijdenote the share of respondents in countryc2f1;2ggiving answerjto
18:577:41691:21:31:71:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:questioni. Then for binary questions, cultural distanceCD12ibetween countries1and2is simply:

18:592:41869:28:21:71:539:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The third challenge is to aggregate question-speciÖc distances in order to obtain summary measures
18:593:41967:21:20:71:539:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of cultural distance. To create summary indices we Örst standardize the question-speciÖc distances
18:594:42065:20:20:71:539:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to have a mean of zero and a standard error equal to one. This ensures equal weighing of questions
18:595:42163:20:21:71:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in every summary index. We next simply sum the question speciÖc indices, to compute several
18:596:42254:21:20:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indices of cultural distance. We Örst sum across all98questions, to obtain an overall index. Next,
18:597:42352:20:20:71:539:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we sum question-speciÖc distances for each of the six categories of questions, as speciÖed by the
18:598:42449:20:21:71:540:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:WVS.21Finally, we created an index for the whole group of binary questions and another one for
18:599:42543:21:26:71:267:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the whole group of non-binary questions.

18:603:42819:20:16:72:540:231:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:World Values Survey for a sample of European countries, and explored the relationship between the resulting matrix
18:604:42933:16:16:72:528:215:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of cultural distance andFSTgenetic distance in Europe, Önding like we do a strong association between the two.
18:605:43043:16:20:80:539:199:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:20We call these non-binary. Non-binary questions are further divided into those that admit an ordering on a scale
18:606:43156:20:16:72:540:179:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(e.g. happiness on a scale from1to10), and those that do not (e.g. do you prefer option 1, option 2 or option 3). This
18:607:43274:16:17:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:distinction is not relevant here. For an in-depth discussion of question types in the WVS, see Desmet, OrtuÒo-OrtÌn

19:615:43940:43:31:72:481:644:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4  Ancestry and culture: A simple conceptual framework
19:616:43994:31:20:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As we discussed in Section 2, genetic distance measures relatedness between populations and is
19:617:44088:20:21:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:roughly proportional to time since two populations shared the same ancestors, that is, since they
19:618:44185:21:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were the same population. Over time, ancestors transmit a large number of traits to their descen-
19:619:44282:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dants, not only biologically (through DNA), but also culturally. This transmission takes place with
19:620:44381:20:21:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation and change over time. Therefore, on average, populations that are more closely related
19:621:44477:21:20:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will have had less time to diverge from each other on a large set of culturally transmitted traits,
19:622:44576:20:20:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such as language, religion, traditions, habits, and values.  This process establishes a close con-
19:623:44674:20:21:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nection between ancestry, measured by genetic distance, and culturally transmitted traits: genetic
19:624:44772:21:20:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance and memetic distance should be positively correlated. A stylized formal model, adapted
19:625:44867:20:20:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009, 2012), can illustrate this relationship in a simpliÖed and concise
19:626:44967:20:27:72:93:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:way.
19:627:44971:27:20:88:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For simplicity, we consider three populations,i= 1;2;3, living at the present time. Population
19:628:45065:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:1and population2descend from the same last common ancestor population, which lived one period
19:629:45158:20:21:72:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ago. In contrast, population3only shares common ancestors with populations1and2going further
19:630:45250:21:20:72:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:in time, back to two periods ago. That is, population3is less closely related with populations1
19:631:45345:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and2than these are with each other. Using the analogy discussed in Section 2, we can say that
19:632:45438:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:populations 1 and 2 are like siblings, while population 3 is a more distant cousin. The phylogenetic
19:633:45538:21:26:72:331:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tree of the three populations is illustrated in Figure 4.
19:634:45595:26:20:88:539:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Building on the results described in Section 2.2.2, we can approximate the genetic distance
19:635:45686:20:21:72:539:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:dg(i;j)between populationiand populationjas the time since they were one population. There-
19:636:45777:21:20:72:539:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fore, genetic distancedg(1;2)between population1and population2is smaller than genetic distance
19:637:45872:20:20:72:539:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between population1and population3, and also smaller than genetic distance between population
19:638:45965:20:21:72:165:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:2and population3:
19:639:45982:21:23:214:539:133:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:A:dg(1;2) =F < dg(1;3) =dg(2;3) =F0(19)
19:640:46019:23:20:80:539:110:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:22However one country, Puerto Rico, drops out in our regression analysis due to missing data on genetic distance,
19:641:46132:20:0:72:336:90:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:leaving us with2;628observations in the regressions of Section 5.
20:642:46199:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:How far in cultural traits are these populations from each other? While, in general, their cultural
20:643:46298:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:divergence may depend on complex processes of transmission across generations of a large set of
20:644:46393:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cultural traits, it is useful to focus on the simplest possible mechanism of cultural transmission
20:645:46491:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with variation, whereby culture is captured by just one trait (ormeme), which we assume can be
20:646:46585:21:20:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:represented as a point on the real line. In each periodt, a populationihas cultural traitsci(t)that
20:647:46684:20:31:72:538:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are inherited with variation from its ancestor population, which had traitsci(t-1), according to:
20:648:46781:31:32:251:539:575:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:A:ci(t) =ci(t-1) +"i(t)(20)
20:649:46806:32:20:71:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where"i(t)measures random variation between timet-1and timet. We assume the simplest
20:650:46890:20:20:71:539:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possible mechanism for variation: cultural change as a random walk. That is,"i(t) =" >0with
20:651:46981:20:20:71:539:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability1=2and"i(t) =-" <0with probability1=2. In addition, we assume that such shocks
20:652:47070:20:27:71:473:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are independent across di§erent populations ("i(t)is independent of"j(t)forj6=i).
20:653:47151:27:20:88:540:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Letdc(i;j)-jcj-cijdenote the distance in cultural traits between populationiand population
20:654:47241:20:20:71:540:436:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:j. The expected memetic distance between population1and population2, which share their last
20:655:47332:20:32:71:458:416:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:common ancestors only one period ago, is denoted byE[dc(1;2)], and given by:23
20:656:47410:32:31:271:539:384:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:A:E[dc(1;2)] ="(21)
20:657:47427:31:20:71:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:All variation between populations1and2is given by cultural change that took place between one
20:658:47520:20:21:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period ago and now. In contrast, expected memetic distance between population1and population
20:659:47612:21:20:71:540:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:3, and between population2and population3, comes from shocks that took place both between
20:660:47701:20:20:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one period ago and now, and between two periods ago and one period ago. On average, such shocks
20:661:47796:20:32:71:407:272:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:are associated with a larger distance in culturally transmitted traits:24

20:666:47914:31:20:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, on average a larger genetic distance is associated with greater distance in cultural traits.
20:667:48017:20:20:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This relation is not deterministic. Some pairs of populations that are more distant cousins may end
20:668:48116:20:21:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:up with more similar cultural traits than two more closely related populations, but that outcome is
20:669:48215:21:20:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:less likely to be observed than the opposite. Therefore, genetic distance and distance in culturally
20:670:48315:20:23:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transmitted traits, such as language, religion, and values, are expected to be positively correlated.

21:676:48780:20:36:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are in fact positively related with di§erences in language, religion and norms, values and attitudes.
21:677:48881:36:28:72:336:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1  Genetic distance and linguistic distance
21:678:48926:28:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Measures of linguistic and genetic distances should be positively correlated. Cavalli-Sforza et al.
21:679:49025:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1994, pp. 98-105) observed that there is usually little genetic admixture between linguistic groups.
21:680:49126:20:21:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Languages are generally transmitted intergenerationally. Thus, phylogenetic trees and linguistic
21:681:49222:21:20:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trees tend to resemble each other. At the same time, we should not expect a perfect relationship,
21:682:49319:20:20:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for several reasons. Firstly, as already mentioned, linguistic data based on trees feature a discrete
21:683:49420:20:21:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of nodes, whereas genetic distance based on a large number of alleles, as we use, is a
21:684:49513:21:20:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:continuous measure of separation times.  Second, the functional forms for measures of genetic
21:685:49606:20:20:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance (FST) and linguistic distance (a nonlinear transformation of the number of di§erent nodes,
21:686:49705:20:21:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or the percentage of non-cognate words, depending on the measure) are di§erent. Third, successful
21:687:49802:21:20:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups conquering the territories of distinct linguistic groups can impose their language without
21:688:49899:20:20:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:necessarily imposing their genes. Such was the case, for instance, with the Magyar conquest of
21:689:49993:20:21:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Hungary: the resulting language was of the Uralic family, but the Magyar genetic admixture was so
21:690:50090:21:20:72:540:328:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limited that the Hungarians are genetically very close to other Slavic populations, such as the Poles.
21:691:50192:20:20:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:An even more stark example comes from the population movements that followed the discovery of
21:692:50285:20:20:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the New World, in particular the slave trade: the current descendants of former slaves do not speak
21:693:50384:20:21:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the original West African languages of their ancestors. Similarly, current inhabitants of the United
21:694:50484:21:20:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:States predominantly speak English, whereas their ancestors came from a diverse set of linguistic
21:695:50581:20:26:72:540:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:groups. Thus, modern migrations served to break the link between genetic and linguistic distance.
21:696:50678:26:21:88:539:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 2, Panel A explores the basic correlations. We Önd that our various measures of linguistic
21:697:50774:21:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance are highly correlated among themselves. For instance, the correlation between weighted
21:698:50869:20:20:72:539:160:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:TLDand weightedCLDis0:82. WeightedTLDis also positively correlated with weighted genetic
21:699:50957:20:21:72:540:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance, with a correlation equal to0:22. However,CLDis not strongly correlated with genetic
21:700:51050:21:20:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance, in all likelihood because the sample is limited to Indo-European speaking countries, which
21:701:51150:20:20:72:540:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tend to also be genetically close: there is not enough variation in the data to detect a signiÖcant
21:702:51249:20:0:72:126:79:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlation.
22:703:51263:0:21:88:539:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 3 presents regressions of our various measures of linguistic distance on genetic distance,
22:704:51359:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with or without controls for a wide range of measures of geographic separation - including geodesic
22:705:51458:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance, the absolute di§erence in longitudes and latitudes, etc. Indeed one concern is that genetic
22:706:51559:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance merely reáects geographic proximity, and that genetic and linguistic distance are positively
22:707:51660:21:20:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlated simply because the relationship goes through geographic distance. We Önd that this is
22:708:51756:20:20:72:540:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not the case, and that genetic distance is signiÖcantly related to tree-based measures of linguistic
22:709:51856:20:21:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance (TLD). In fact, the standardized beta coe¢ cient onFSTgenetic distance, reported in the
22:710:51952:21:20:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:last line of Table 2, suggests that a one standard deviation increase in genetic distance is associated
22:711:52055:20:20:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with a0:15-0:22standard deviation increase in linguistic distance, depending on the measure
22:712:52146:20:21:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and speciÖcation.25For the cognate-based measures (CLD), the relationship is negative, but not
22:713:52240:21:26:71:223:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:robustly signiÖcant statistically.
22:714:52274:26:20:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As mentioned already, the population movements that followed the discovery of the New World
22:715:52365:20:21:71:539:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were important factors breaking the link between genetic and linguistic distance. To investigate
22:716:52461:21:20:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this issue, Table 4 isolates the sample consisting of Old World countries. This excludes any country
22:717:52561:20:20:71:539:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pair containing a country from the Americas or Oceania. We Önd much larger correlations than in
22:718:52656:20:20:71:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table 3. For instance, the standardized betas on weightedTLDnow range between0:29and0:41.
22:719:52745:20:21:71:539:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, the correlations between genetic distance andCLDturn positive, and signiÖcant in the
22:720:52839:21:20:71:539:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:univariate cases. These results show there exists a strong correlation between genetic and linguistic
22:721:52940:20:20:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance for country pairs least likely to have experienced language replacement over the course of
22:722:53039:20:37:71:158:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the last500years.
22:723:53056:37:27:71:331:279:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.2  Genetic distance and religious distance
22:724:53100:27:20:71:539:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Like language, religious beliefs tend to be transmitted intergenerationally, leading us to expect a
22:725:53199:20:21:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive correlation between religious distance and genetic distance. However, several factors may
22:726:53297:21:20:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limit the extent to which religious distance correlates with genealogical distance. First, while they
22:727:53398:20:20:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may Önd their sources in ancient religious beliefs, several major world religions appeared relatively
22:728:53499:20:21:71:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:recently. For instance, one of the oldest monotheistic religions, Judaism, appeared only3;500years
22:729:53597:21:20:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ago. Second, in line with the Örst observation, the rate of drift of religious beliefs is likely to be much
22:730:53704:20:22:71:539:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:faster than that of genes, so that populations that are genetically similar often espouse di§erent
22:731:53802:22:21:80:539:108:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:25It is well-known that the standardized beta is equal to the correlation coe¢ cient for the univariate case. This can
22:732:53920:21:16:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:be veriÖed by comparing the standardized betas in columns (1) and (3) to the corresponding ones in Table 2 Panel
22:733:54032:16:0:72:81:71:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:A.
23:734:54036:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:religious beliefs. In fact, two recent religious innovations, Christianity and Islam, occurred among
23:735:54136:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:closely related populations in the Middle East. Third, religious beliefs are transmitted horizontally
23:736:54237:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:through conquests and conversions, perhaps to a faster extent than even languages, as it is easier
23:737:54335:20:21:72:540:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to change oneís religion than oneís language. Thus, the emergence and horizontal di§usion of new
23:738:54431:21:20:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:religions is likely to weaken the link between religious distance and genetic distance perhaps to a
23:739:54530:20:20:72:540:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:greater extent than for linguistic distance. Fourth, the aforementioned functional form di§erences
23:740:54628:20:21:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between metrics of linguistic and genetic distance apply with the same force to measures of religious
23:741:54729:21:26:72:114:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance.
23:742:54738:26:20:88:539:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite these caveats, we do Önd that religious distance is positively correlated with genetic
23:743:54832:20:21:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance. The Örst piece of evidence in presented in Panel B of Table 2. There we see, for instance,
23:744:54932:21:20:72:539:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that weighted religious distance based on the Mecham, Fearon and Laitin religious tree (F-RD)
23:745:55025:20:20:72:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bears a0:18correlation with weighted genetic distance. Correlations are smaller using measures
23:746:55119:20:21:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based on the World Christian Database tree (WCD-RD), which are less Önely disaggregated.
23:747:55207:21:20:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We also Önd substantial positive correlations among our various measures of religious distance, but
23:748:55306:20:26:72:460:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these correlations are not su¢ ciently high to justify looking at only one measure.
23:749:55389:26:20:88:539:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Tables 5 and 6 present regression evidence, again with or without controls for geographic dis-
23:750:55483:20:21:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tance for each of the4measures of religious distance. In all but one of the speciÖcations, genetic
23:751:55581:21:20:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance comes out with a positive statistically signiÖcant coe¢ cient. The standardized magnitude
23:752:55679:20:20:72:540:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the e§ect of genetic distance is generally smaller than for linguistic distance, in line with the
23:753:55779:20:21:72:539:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observation above. Yet, in particular forF-RD, we Önd standardized e§ects comprised between
23:754:55870:21:20:72:539:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:8:3percent and18:1percent, again consistent with our model of cultural drift. Moreover, unlike
23:755:55964:20:20:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for language, we do not Önd a particular tendency for the e§ect to be more pronounced among Old
23:756:56059:20:37:72:198:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:World countries (Table 6).
23:757:56085:37:27:72:329:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.3  Genetic distance and cultural distance
23:758:56128:27:20:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our Önal exploration concerns the relationship between genetic distance and distance in norms,
23:759:56222:20:21:72:540:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:values and attitudes. We start with an analysis of the relationship between genetic distance and
23:760:56318:21:20:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:question-speciÖc distances, for all available questions from the WVS. Under the null hypothesis of
23:761:56416:20:20:72:540:124:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no relationship between genetic and cultural distances we would expect5percent of the correlations
23:762:56514:20:21:72:540:104:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to be signiÖcant (2:5percent positive and signiÖcant), and the distribution of correlations to be
23:763:56611:21:0:72:540:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:centered around zero.  Figure 5 presents a histogram of sample correlations between bilateral
24:764:56706:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance for each question, and weighted genetic distance, for the full set of740questions.26The
24:765:56802:21:20:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mode of the distribution is well to the right of zero, with a mean of about10percent.71:6percent
24:766:56898:20:20:71:539:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the correlations were positive. In53:1percent of the cases the correlation with genetic distance
24:767:56997:20:21:71:539:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is both positive and signiÖcant, far in excess of what we would expect under the null. A substantial
24:768:57097:21:20:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subset of the questions feature correlations that are quite large - for22:4percent of the questions,
24:769:57197:20:26:71:492:606:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:the correlations are in excess of0:20and statistically signiÖcant at the5percent level.27
24:770:57286:26:20:88:539:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These simple correlations could confound the e§ects of geographic distance with those of genetic
24:771:57382:20:20:71:539:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance. To address this issue, we ran regressions, for each question, of WVS distance on genetic
24:772:57480:20:21:71:539:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and geodesic distance. Figure 6 presents a histogram of the standardized beta coe¢ cient on genetic
24:773:57579:21:20:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance, representing the e§ect of a one standard deviation change in genetic distance as a share of
24:774:57680:20:20:71:540:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a standard deviation in the dependent variable.66:9percent of the standardized betas are positive,
24:775:57778:20:20:71:539:479:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and47:2percent are both positive and signiÖcant at the5percent level. We also Önd a number of
24:776:57871:20:21:71:540:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:large e§ects, with20percent of the standardized betas greater than0:20.28Controlling for geodesic
24:777:57968:21:25:71:338:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance does not modify the conclusion reached earlier.
24:778:58024:25:21:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While these results are informative, they conáate questions on very di§erent subjects, and of
24:779:58117:21:20:71:539:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erent types (binary versus non-binary). So we now turn to the relationship between our9indices
24:780:58214:20:20:71:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of cultural distance, and genetic distance. The analysis is now limited to the98questions available
24:781:58313:20:21:71:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for74countries.  Table 7 presents simple correlations.  Genetic distance bears a correlation of

24:783:58504:20:20:71:539:311:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance is positively and signiÖcantly correlated with8of our9measures of cultural distance based
24:784:58602:20:21:71:539:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the WVS. The only category for which this is not the case is category D, pertaining to questions
24:785:58701:21:20:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:about family. Among the other categories, the correlation with genetic distance varies between7:4
24:786:58798:20:26:71:458:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent (questions on work) and29:9percent (questions on politics and society).
24:787:58877:26:20:88:539:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Tables 8 and 9 we turn to regression analysis, following the same format as earlier: for
24:788:58968:20:20:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:each index we present a univariate regression and one that controls for geographic barriers. Table

24:790:59159:22:20:80:539:162:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:26The underlying sample varies across questions, which could introduce some bias. However, the results are no
24:791:59268:20:16:72:519:142:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:di§erent when we focus on the set of98questions for which we have a balanced sample of2;701country pairs.
24:792:59373:16:20:80:539:126:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:27For the restricted set of98questions covering a balanced set of countries,63:3percent of the correlations were

24:794:59547:15:20:80:540:91:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:28For the restricted set of98questions,67:3percent of the standardized beta coe¢ cients on genetic distance were

25:796:59750:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-binary questions. We Önd a large, statistically signiÖcant positive relationship between genetic
25:797:59850:21:20:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance and cultural distance. In the speciÖcation with controls (column 2), the standardized e§ect
25:798:59950:20:20:72:540:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of genetic distance is25:5percent. While the e§ect remains positive and signiÖcant for both binary
25:799:60048:20:21:72:539:647:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and non-binary questions, it is largest for the latter - with a standardized e§ect of30:2percent.
25:800:60145:21:20:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Interestingly, the inclusion of geographic distance controls serves to weaken the e§ect of genetic

25:803:60364:21:20:71:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:controls, we see positive and signiÖcant e§ects of genetic distance on cultural distance for all but
25:804:60464:20:20:71:539:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:category D (Family). The largest e§ects, quantitatively, are for categories A (Perceptions of Life),
25:805:60564:20:21:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:E (Politics and Society) and F (Religion and Morale).  Future work should seek to delve more
25:806:60656:21:43:71:504:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deeply into the characteristics of questions most closely associated with ancestral distance.
25:807:60749:43:31:71:173:455:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6  Conclusion
25:808:60762:31:20:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:What does genetic distance measure? In this paper we argued that genetic distance is a summary
25:809:60856:20:21:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:statistic for di§erences in a wide range of intergenerationally transmitted human traits. We focused
25:810:60956:21:20:71:539:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on language, religion and values, Önding empirical evidence of a positive correlation between genetic
25:811:61057:20:20:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance and linguistic, religious and cultural distances. It is important to note that genetic distance
25:812:61161:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is not strongly correlated with only a small and speciÖc subset of di§erences in cultural traits. On
25:813:61261:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the contrary, genetic distance tends to be broadly and signiÖcantly correlated with a vast range
25:814:61357:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of di§erences in cultural traits.  Thus, while speciÖc correlations with individual sets of traits
25:815:61455:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are typically moderate in magnitude, there is an overall relation between ancestry and culture,
25:816:61550:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with a conceptual framework in which a broad range of cultural traits are transmitted
25:817:61646:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with variation across generations over time. Genetic distance is a useful summary statistic capturing
25:818:61747:20:27:71:300:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erences in this broad range of cultural traits.
25:819:61797:27:20:88:539:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Future research should seek to improve on this evidence. Recent progress in the measurement of
25:820:61891:20:20:71:539:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:linguistic di§erences, using systematic quantitative methods, will allow for a more precise evaluation
25:821:61993:20:21:71:539:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the e§ects of linguistic distance on political economy outcomes. Similarly, improvements in the
25:822:62091:21:20:71:539:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gathering of genetic data should lead to improvements in our ability to detect e§ects of ancestral
25:823:62189:20:20:71:539:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distance on cultural distance and in turn on political economy outcomes. As more genetic data
25:824:62282:20:20:71:539:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on more Önely deÖned populations become available, more granular analyses of the relationship
25:825:62375:20:0:71:539:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between genetic and cultural distance will become possible. Third, alternative data sets on values,
26:826:62476:0:21:72:540:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:norms and attitudes also exist, either regionally or worldwide, and could be used to complement
26:827:62571:21:25:72:132:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our analysis.

26:829:62676:21:20:72:540:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is in its infancy. With this paper we have sought to clarify what observable traits are captured by
26:830:62775:20:41:72:307:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ancestral distance, but much remains to be done.
