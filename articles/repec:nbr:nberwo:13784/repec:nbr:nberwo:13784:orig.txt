2:30:1653:28:28:306:339:602:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:31:1661:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:Strong sentences are common "tough on crime" tool used to reduce the incentives for individuals to
2:32:1759:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:participate in criminal activity. However, the design of such policies often ignores other margins along
2:33:1863:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:which individuals interested in participating in crime may adjust.   I use California's Three Strikes
2:34:1964:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:law to identify several effects of a large increase in the penalty for a broad set of crimes.  Using criminal
2:35:2073:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:records data, I estimate that Three Strikes reduced participation in criminal activity by 20 percent for
2:36:2177:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:second-strike eligible offenders and a 28 percent decline for third-strike eligible offenders.  However,
2:37:2281:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:I find two unintended consequences of the law. First, because Three Strikes flattened the penalty gradient
2:38:2387:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:with respect to severity, criminals were more likely to commit more violent crimes.  Among third-strike
2:39:2490:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:eligible offenders, the probability of committing violent crimes increased by 9 percentage points. 
2:40:2589:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:Second, because California's law was more harsh than the laws of other nearby states, Three Strikes
2:41:2688:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:had a "beggar-thy-neighbor" effect increasing the migration of criminals with second and third-strike
2:42:2789:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:eligibility to commit crimes in neighboring states. The high cost of incarceration combined with the
2:43:2889:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:high cost of violent crime relative to non-violent crime implies that Three Strikes may not be a cost-effective
2:44:3000:14:42:72:194:392:12:Times:12:Times:means of reducing crime.

3:52:3190:0:21:261:353:708:144:Times:144:Times:1. INTRODUCTION 
3:53:3205:21:21:89:92:687:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:54:3205:21:21:71:549:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The high crime rates of the 1980s coupled with the belief that prison served as a “revolving 
3:55:3298:21:21:71:550:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:door” for criminal activity, prompted new sentencing laws aimed at increasing sentences for repeat 
3:56:3397:21:21:71:541:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders.   One of the most publicized new policies was habitual offender law, commonly called 
3:57:3493:21:21:71:523:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“Three-Strikes You’re Out”.  This paper uses California’s version of this law to estimate how 
3:58:3587:21:21:71:529:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminals respond to changes in sentencing policy.  California’s Three Strikes law changed the 
3:59:3682:21:21:71:547:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:penalty structure in two ways: it increased the expected penalty for all crimes (intercept shift), and 
3:60:3785:21:21:71:541:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:flattened the penalty gradient with respect to severity of crime (slope shift).  I develop a model in 
3:61:3887:21:21:71:531:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:which the increase in the intercept has the expected effect of decreasing crime levels, while the 
3:62:3985:21:21:71:552:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gradient shift has the unanticipated consequence of encouraging a shift toward more serious crime.  
3:63:4085:21:21:71:507:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:I empirically examine the relative magnitude of these two effects using California’s Three 
3:64:4176:21:21:71:549:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes law.  The results suggest that Three Strikes reduced the overall level of crime but increased 
3:65:4278:21:21:71:556:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the propensity to commit violent crime.  Depending on the societal preferences regarding the cost of 
3:66:4379:21:21:71:541:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:non-violent and violent crimes, such offsetting distributional effects may substantially reduce the 
3:67:4479:21:21:71:556:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:benefits of broad enhancements in sentencing.  In addition I find that some of California’s reduction 
3:68:4581:21:21:71:544:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:comes at the expense of other states.  This further suggests that single-state enhancements may be 
3:69:4680:21:21:71:389:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more costly from a national perspective than previously believed. 
3:70:4746:21:21:71:529:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In part because of the high publicity surrounding the law and in part because it remains 
3:71:4835:21:21:71:539:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among the most striking examples of across-the-board sentence enhancements, there has been an 
3:72:4929:21:21:71:526:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:extensive literature aimed at estimating the overall effect of Three Strikes law.  Early work by 
3:73:5026:21:21:71:548:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Greenwood et al (1994) estimated huge costs and limited deterrence from the law change based on 
3:74:5122:21:21:71:546:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:projections of current offenders among Three Strikes states.  Macallair and Males (1999) compare 
3:75:5219:21:21:71:546:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:counties with strict versus lax Three Strikes enforcement. They find counties that strictly enforced 
3:76:5320:21:21:71:532:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the sentence enhancements saw negligible effects on crime rates.  Marvell and Moody’s (2000) 
3:77:5413:21:21:71:527:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cross-state analysis also found Three Strikes has little effect on overall crime rates but found a 
3:78:5512:21:21:71:524:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant increase in the number of murders.  Comparing counties and age groups, Jaimeson 
3:79:5604:21:21:71:549:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1999) finds little effect of Three Strikes on criminal participation.  Shepherd (2001) compared the 
3:80:5705:21:21:71:549:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rates of triggering and non-triggering offenses before and after Three-Strikes and found significant 
3:81:5806:21:21:71:554:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:declines in triggering offenses supporting a deterrence effect from expected increased punishment.   
3:82:5907:21:0:71:551:78:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Most recently, evidence from Helland and Tabarrok (2007) shows a significant deterrence effect of 
4:83:6011:0:21:72:483:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three Strikes law on second strike offenders concentrated among violent offenders.   
4:84:6096:21:21:72:549:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Previous attempts to estimate the effect of Three-Strikes have been limited by the ability to 
4:85:6190:21:21:72:549:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:establish a valid control group.  This paper uses the unique structure of Three-Strikes law in which 
4:86:6291:21:21:72:547:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders with the same criminal history but different ordering of crime commission face different 
4:87:6390:21:21:72:521:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing eligibility to identify the effect of Three-Strikes sentencing eligibility on criminal 
4:88:6488:21:21:72:516:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activity.  In particular, the law required that an individual commit a “record aggravating” or 
4:89:6583:21:21:72:538:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“triggering” offense in order to activate eligibility for Three-Strikes law sentencing.  This meant 
4:90:6683:21:21:72:556:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that individuals who committed a “triggering” offense followed by a felony faced different potential 
4:91:6784:21:21:72:538:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentences than those who committed a felony and then a “triggering” offense.  Using individuals 
4:92:6880:21:21:72:524:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:who committed the same crimes but in different orders, I estimate a baseline difference in the 
4:93:6975:21:21:72:558:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:likelihood of re-offending and of committing a violent crime conditional on re-offending prior to the 
4:94:7077:21:21:72:546:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:law change.  I estimate the post-Three-Strikes difference in their likelihood of re-offending and of 
4:95:7178:21:21:72:551:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:committing a violent crime conditional on re-offending.  Differencing out the baseline likelihood, I 
4:96:7279:21:21:72:548:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimate a 9 percentage point decrease in the propensity to re-offend.  In part, this appears due to a 
4:97:7382:21:21:72:476:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lengthened duration of non-participation in criminal activities by repeat offenders.   
4:98:7469:21:21:72:550:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: While Three Strikes had the intended effect of reducing participation in crime, there appear 
4:99:7562:21:21:72:519:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to be two sizeable unintended consequences of this law.  First, there is an 8 percentage point 
4:100:7657:21:21:72:539:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in the propensity to commit violent crime conditional on committing a new crime.  This 
4:101:7753:21:21:72:532:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect, while smaller than the effect on the participation margin is a non-negligible and socially 
4:102:7852:21:21:72:547:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:costly consequence of broad sentencing policies which apply equal penalties to a crime of varying 
4:103:7950:21:21:72:544:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:severity.   Second, some of the reduction in criminal participation in California appears due to the 
4:104:8051:21:21:72:534:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:migratory response of repeat offenders who opt to move to lower-sanctioning states. Thus there 
4:105:8146:21:21:72:493:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:appears to be a “beggar thy neighbor” spillover effect from state level sentencing laws. 
4:106:8235:21:21:72:553:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This paper adds to the literature attempting to estimate the effectiveness of harsh sentencing 
4:107:8330:21:21:72:553:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regimes on crime levels.  Consistent with more recent literature, I find an overall effect of a decline 
4:108:8434:21:21:72:535:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the criminal participation rate among second and third strike eligible offenders and a reduced 
4:109:8532:21:21:72:556:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:propensity to commit record-aggravating offenses among first-strike eligible offenders.  In addition, 
4:110:8634:21:21:72:497:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this paper attempt to systematically disentangle the competing effects of broad sentence 
4:111:8723:21:21:72:537:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enhancements on both the decision to participate in criminal activity and the selection of type of 
4:112:8822:21:21:72:552:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime committed conditional on participation criminal activity as well as the mechanisms by which 
4:113:8920:21:0:72:541:78:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:reduction in criminal activity is accomplished (e.g. deterrence versus migration).  Separating and 
5:114:9025:0:21:72:548:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:identifying the margins along which criminals adapt to sentence enhancements can reveal not only 
5:115:9122:21:21:72:541:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the overall effect of long sentences but also the general responsiveness of criminals to cost-based 
5:116:9222:21:21:72:504:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:incentives and the relative magnitudes of their responsiveness across different margins of 
5:117:9313:21:21:72:134:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:adjustment.  
5:118:9326:21:21:72:547:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents a framework for considering 
5:119:9418:21:21:72:539:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing regimes and the specific case of the effects of Three Strikes law on criminal activity.  
5:120:9518:21:21:72:542:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Section 3 presents the data and strategy used to identify the causal effect of change in the penalty 
5:121:9619:21:21:72:554:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:structure on criminal activity.  Section 4 presents the results from an empirical analysis of the effect 
5:122:9724:21:21:72:530:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of Three Strikes law on the propensity to commit crimes as well as its effects on migration and 
5:123:9820:21:21:72:534:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime selection.  Section 5 uses the empirical results to estimate the social benefit of changes in 
5:124:9920:21:21:72:379:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing structure and then offers some concluding remarks.

5:127:10040:21:21:72:75:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
5:128:10040:21:21:72:518:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Broad sentence enhancements have been a common tool for increasing the potential costs of 
5:129:10130:21:21:72:537:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal activity.  Most policies focus on maximizing the effect of these laws on participation in 
5:130:10229:21:21:72:557:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal activity but there are several margins of along which criminals may adjust their behavior in 
5:131:10331:21:21:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:response to the enhanced sentencing.  For example, as illustrated in Stigler (1978) while the most 
5:132:10430:21:21:72:551:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:obvious margin of adjustment is participation, another means of adjustment is the severity of crime 
5:133:10530:21:21:72:554:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(which assuming returns to crime are increasing in severity may raise the profit of crime despite the 
5:134:10632:21:21:72:503:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increased cost of enhanced sentencing).  In this section I develop a simple framework for 
5:135:10722:21:21:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:considering the potential effect of different types of sentence enhancements and then consider the 
5:136:10821:21:21:72:309:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specific case of California’s Three Strikes law.    
5:137:10873:21:21:72:75:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
5:138:10873:21:21:72:179:204:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:2.1 Basic Framework 
5:139:10893:21:21:108:510:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:To begin understanding the effect of changes in sentencing policies on a criminal’s 
5:140:10977:21:21:72:537:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decision, consider a simple version of the rational criminal’s decision-making process (based on 
5:141:11074:21:21:72:531:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Becker, 1968).  An individual will choose to commit a crime only if the utility from this crime, 
5:142:11171:21:23:72:538:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as defined by the difference between the revenue and the expected cost of committing this crime 
5:143:11267:23:0:72:328:97:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(Ucrime), is greater than some reservation utility (U): 
6:144:11329:0:23:333:576:706:144:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f1:UUcrime≥      (1) 
6:145:11347:23:21:72:550:683:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In such a model, the high cost of crime, typically generated by expected cost of imprisonment, will 
6:146:11447:21:21:72:535:662:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cause many individuals not to commit crime at all. To illustrate this relationship more formally, 
6:147:11545:21:23:72:214:641:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:define the utility from crime: 
6:148:11576:23:23:108:554:618:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:    TPgpRpUTTT⋅−⋅−−⋅=θ)()1(                                    (2)            
6:149:11654:23:21:72:544:595:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:An individual’s utility from crime expressed above is separated into three terms.  The first term is 
6:150:11755:21:21:72:555:574:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the returns from crime of type T, RT, which occurs with probability p.  The second term is the utility 
6:151:11858:21:21:72:518:553:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of a failed attempted at crime type T, for which the criminal must pay PT and receives utility 
6:152:11953:21:21:71:556:532:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponding to g(PT).  This second term occurs with probability 1 – p.   The third term is the fixed 
6:153:12056:21:21:72:504:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cost to the criminal of committing crime T, θ ·T, and occurs regardless of success.  In this 
6:154:12149:21:21:72:555:490:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:framework, θT represents an individual cost specific term that incorporates psychic costs of crime as 
6:155:12251:21:21:72:552:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:well as other individual-specific factors which may generate utility or disutility from crime (i.e. the 
6:156:12355:21:21:72:522:448:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:additional private return from crime).  The distribution θ is described by F(θ) which admits a 
6:157:12449:21:21:72:552:427:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:density f(θ).  Normalize the utility of the outside option to zero.  For illustrative purposes, let utility 
6:158:12557:21:21:72:552:406:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:gain from crime be linear in the type of crime and let the utility from punishment be represented by 
6:159:12658:21:21:72:435:385:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the function g which is strictly monotonic in PT and twice differentiable. 1   
6:160:12737:21:21:72:547:364:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f5: For simplicity, suppose there are only 2 types of crime.  Violent crime has a payoff RH = H 
6:161:12829:21:21:72:543:343:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and a penalty of PH and non-violent crime has a payoff of RL = L and a penalty of PL where H > L 
6:162:12924:21:21:72:548:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and PH ≥ PL.  Using these simplifications, it is possible to divide the decisions of individuals in the 
6:163:13027:21:22:72:548:301:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:distribution into three categories: non-criminal activity, non-violent crime, and violent crime.  The 
6:164:13129:22:21:72:540:279:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal participation margin is defined as the value of θ which sets the utility from non-criminal 
6:165:13228:21:21:72:552:258:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activity (T = 0) and non-violent criminal activity (T=L) equal.2  Defining θParticipate as the value that 
6:166:13334:21:21:71:554:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:makes the participation constraint hold at equality, the probability that an individual will participate 
6:167:13439:21:22:71:182:216:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in crime is:

6:169:13560:25:19:71:521:169:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:The cutoff value from equation 3 is illustrated in figure 1, where F is assumed to be a normal

6:171:13713:8:16:72:521:142:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1 Note that if g(.) were simply linear then the results in this section would obtain. However, because we wish to 
6:172:13827:16:12:71:492:126:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:allow for an ambiguous effect of an intercept shift in the level of punishment (rather than the ratio of the 
6:173:13936:12:8:71:393:114:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:punishments), the added complexity of a more general g(.) function is included. 
6:174:14016:8:0:72:528:106:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 Note that the subsequent analysis assumes, θParticipate< θSeverity.  This will be the case if g(PH) is sufficiently small 
7:175:14146:0:21:72:545:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.   As illustrated, the distribution of  θ generates a range of 
7:176:14248:21:21:72:537:687:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:individuals who participate in crime some of whom would shift their behavior into non-criminal 
7:177:14343:21:21:72:529:666:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:activity with a small increase in costs and some of whom would not deterred even after a large 
7:178:14438:21:21:71:533:645:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:increases in the cost of crime.  Since g (.) is monotonic in PL, an increase in the penalty for non-
7:179:14538:21:21:71:545:624:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:violent crime will shift θParticipate to the left.  Thus, some individuals are deterred from engaging in 
7:180:14643:21:21:71:165:603:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:criminal activity.    
7:181:14665:21:21:71:511:582:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: The crime severity margin is the boundary value of  θ  at which criminals decide to 
7:182:14749:21:21:72:554:561:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:participate in non-violent or violent crime. Individuals who commit violent crime are intuitively the 
7:183:14851:21:21:72:555:540:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:set of individuals whose value of θ sets the payoffs from non-violent (T = L) as less than those from 
7:184:14953:21:21:72:531:519:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:violent (T = H).  Defining θseverity as the value of θ which sets the payoffs from the two types of 
7:185:15052:21:30:72:467:498:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:crime equal, the probability that an individual will participate in violent crime is:

7:205:15591:21:21:72:557:310:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1: In the basic framework, the existence of the criminal participation margin and crime severity 
7:206:15685:21:21:72:553:289:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:margin is generated by an assumed difference in the penalty structure which penalizes more serious 
7:207:15784:21:21:72:524:268:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:crimes (e.g. violent crimes) more severely.4  Suppose the relationship between the penalty for 
7:208:15879:21:22:72:541:247:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:violent and non-violent crime is described as follows: PL = β·PH where 0 <  β ≤ 1.  In this setting, 
7:209:15979:22:20:72:542:225:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                                                                                                                                                           
7:210:16165:20:9:71:301:205:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:relative to g(PL).  Specifically, this condition will hold if

7:219:16246:25:16:72:534:186:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3 This follows in the vein of Stigler (1970) and Becker (1968).  The debate between the two articles concerns what 
7:220:16361:16:12:71:531:170:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:role that a penalty gradient with respect to crime severity might play.  In his classical model, the efficient criminal 
7:221:16481:12:12:71:539:158:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:punishment system applies maximal (ideally infinite) punishment to all crimes with low probability of enforcement. 
7:222:16596:12:12:71:538:146:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:This system is efficient in the sense that it has the highest ratio of crimes deterred relative to cost.  Stigler countered 
7:223:16720:12:12:71:529:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:that this effect was concentrated on the participation margin, which he labeled “average deterrence.”  In Becker’s 
7:224:16835:12:12:71:515:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:model, the additional penalties for more severe crime, which Stigler labeled “marginal deterrence” introduced 
7:225:16945:12:12:71:538:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:inefficiency in the sense that it potentially lowers this ratio. Stigler’s response suggested that the increased marginal 
7:226:17067:12:12:71:529:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:cost of crimes was necessary to transfer the increased social cost of these crimes onto the individual imposing the 
7:227:17183:12:8:71:140:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:costs on society. 
7:228:17201:8:0:72:319:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f5:4 This was generated in the above case by assuming PH > PL. 
8:229:17267:0:21:72:543:708:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:1/β represents the penalty-severity gradient.  A small β corresponds to a steep gradient meaning a 
8:230:17365:21:21:71:536:687:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:very large penalty for violent crime relative to non-violent crime. If β=1 then the crime-severity 
8:231:17464:21:21:71:523:666:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:gradient is flat meaning that there is no additional penalty for more severe crimes.  Using this

8:277:18679:21:21:71:538:326:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:because the returns from successful criminal activity are fixed and thus an increase in the cost of

8:283:19201:21:21:72:537:200:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:two effects: first, it reduces the number of individuals willing to participate in criminal activity.

8:288:19475:8:16:72:531:102:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:5 In the language of Becker and Stiglitz, for non-violent crime the average and marginal deterrence effect move in 
8:289:19590:16:12:72:518:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:the same direction and the model predicts an unambiguous decline in non-violent crime. For violent crime, the 
8:290:19700:12:0:72:503:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:average and marginal effects move in different directions and the overall effect of the policy is ambiguous. 
9:291:19815:0:21:72:227:708:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:2.3 Changing the Penalty Level

9:293:19938:21:21:72:504:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime participation and severity margins, a simple scaled increase in penalties has a more 
9:294:20029:21:29:72:536:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:ambiguous effect.  Suppose rather than changing the penalty gradient, there is an increase in the 
9:295:20127:29:9:72:461:616:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f5:absolute level of penalties of crime such that the new penalty, TP is defined as TTPP

9:381:21788:21:21:72:553:97:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from violent to non-violent crime because of the escalating disutility from more severe crime.  That

10:386:22253:21:21:72:525:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:it has an ambiguous effect on the fraction of individuals participating in criminal activity who

10:389:22375:21:21:72:505:582:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:2.4 California’s Three-Strikes Law as an Instrument for Changes in Sentencing Structure 
10:390:22463:21:21:89:529:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In 1993, Washington and Wisconsin were the first states to adopt Three-Strikes sentencing 
10:391:22553:21:21:71:531:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:laws. By 1997, twenty-two other states and the Federal Government instituted similar statutes.  
10:392:22649:21:21:71:506:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The common underlying theme among these statutes was severe punishment for recidivist 
10:393:22735:21:21:71:541:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders.  Although many states ignored their statute, two important components of California’s 
10:394:22832:21:21:71:514:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:law led it be strictly enforced.  First, the broad coverage of the law offered highly enhanced 
10:395:22927:21:21:71:499:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing for all felonies allowing wide application.  Second, lack of judicial discretion 
10:396:23019:21:21:71:488:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:prevented judges from circumventing the law in cases in which its application seemed 
10:397:23104:21:21:71:510:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unreasonable.6  In California as of 2000, over 40,000 offenders have been sentenced under 
10:398:23194:21:21:72:527:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three-Strikes while no other state has even reached 1000 (Zimring, Hawkins, Kamin, 2001).7  
10:399:23286:21:21:72:543:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Three-Strikes changed the entire sentencing structure for felonies in two distinct ways.  In 
10:400:23379:21:21:72:508:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:order to activate Three Strikes sentencing, individuals needed to be convicted of a “record 
10:401:23471:21:21:72:548:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aggravating” offense.  As Table 1 shows, the aggravating offenses are very broad under California 
10:402:23569:21:21:72:537:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:law, ranging from murder and rape to burglary.8  The important aspect of the legal structure was 
10:403:23666:21:21:72:533:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that California law invokes a second or third strike for any felony, so long as the individual was 
10:404:23765:21:21:71:310:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:previously convicted of an aggravating offense.9  
10:405:23815:21:21:72:554:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Specifically the structure of the law introduced two distinct changes to the penalty structure. 
10:406:23911:21:21:72:539:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: On the third strike, California’s Three Strikes law required individuals to serve the maximum of 
10:407:24009:21:21:72:542:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:three times the sentence of the current felony or 25 years to life.  Eligible individuals did not face 
10:408:24112:21:25:72:546:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:any additional punishment for violent offenses relative to non-violent ones.  This corresponds to a 
10:409:24212:25:8:72:219:158:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
10:410:24270:8:16:72:526:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:6 In California, only prosecutors had discretion as to whether to charge individuals with qualifying offenses until 
10:411:24386:16:8:71:360:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:1997, when the California Supreme Court reinstated judicial discretion. 
10:412:24458:8:16:72:536:126:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:7  Several studies (National Institute of Justice, 1996; Dickey, 1996; Kessler and Levitt, 1998), as well as anecdotal 
10:413:24577:16:8:71:491:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:observations by the media indicate that Three-Strikes statutes have rarely been invoked anywhere else.   
10:414:24682:8:12:72:316:102:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:8 Definitions of offenses are presented in Appendix Table 1. 
10:415:24743:12:16:72:529:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:9 In fact, a prior prison sentence is not even required to trigger additional penalties, a unique feature of California 
10:416:24863:16:0:71:234:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:law (Clark, Austin, and Henry, 1997).    
11:417:24911:0:21:72:547:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:flat penalty-severity gradient (i.e. β =1) and the anticipated effect illustrated above is a decrease in 
11:418:25016:21:21:72:546:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal participation but an increase violent crime conditional upon participation.  On the second 
11:419:25116:21:21:72:530:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strike, California’s Three Strikes law criminals faced a doubling of the sentence for the second 
11:420:25213:21:23:72:554:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:felony.  Thus, on the second strike, eligible individuals faced inflated sentences for all crimes.  This 
11:421:25318:23:23:72:546:622:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:corresponds to the case where α =0.5 such that TTPP2= for both violent and non-violent crimes.  
11:422:25414:23:21:72:546:599:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:There is an ambiguous effect on the severity of crime conditional on participation that depends on 
11:423:25513:21:21:72:386:578:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the nature of the disutility from unsuccessful criminal attempts.   
11:424:25581:21:21:72:554:557:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To summarize the predicted overall effect of the law: (1) there is an unambiguous decline in 
11:425:25674:21:21:72:557:536:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:participation in criminal activity among second and third-strike eligible offenders, (2) there is a shift 
11:426:25780:21:21:72:551:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to more severe crime among third-strike eligible individuals who participate in crime, and (3) there 
11:427:25881:21:21:72:456:494:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is a potential change in the severity level of crime committed by second strike.

11:430:25989:21:21:72:75:431:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5: 
11:431:25989:21:21:72:542:410:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  The analysis in this paper uses a sample of offender records for individuals arrested from 
11:432:26081:21:21:72:526:389:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:1990-1999 sampled from three California cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.  
11:433:26173:21:21:72:513:368:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The sample thus includes individuals who have been arrested at least one time for a felony, 
11:434:26265:21:21:72:504:347:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:though many of these individuals will not have been convicted.  This data is linked to the 
11:435:26356:21:21:72:522:326:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Criminal Offenders Record Information (CORI) which provides information on previous and 
11:436:26444:21:21:72:543:305:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:future offenses.  The retrospective information includes prior convictions, prior sentences served, 
11:437:26544:21:21:72:513:284:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and the total number of prior arrests.  The information on future criminal activity details all 
11:438:26640:21:21:72:522:263:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:felony convictions after the year of arrest until 1999.  These arrest records also document the 
11:439:26736:21:21:72:533:242:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:final disposition of the crime for which the individual is under arrest which includes conviction 
11:440:26834:21:21:72:487:221:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and sentence length.  Finally, the arrest records include some information on personal 
11:441:26921:21:21:72:537:200:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:characteristics such as age, gender, and race. I partition individuals into three groups: first strike 
11:442:27024:21:21:72:542:179:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eligible, second strike eligible and third strike eligible based on their criminal history and current 
11:443:27127:21:21:72:539:158:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offense and disposition.  Within each group, offenders have between zero and six prior felonies.  
11:444:27225:21:21:72:519:137:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In addition, I append information on police spending, prosecution, and other criminal justice 
11:445:27319:21:21:72:542:116:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:spending from California Criminal Justice Profiles.  I also use information on unemployment and 
11:446:27415:21:0:72:350:95:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:poverty information from the Current Population Survey. 
12:447:27478:0:21:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: It is worth noting that the data used in this paper, while imperfect, represents a substantial 
12:448:27573:21:21:72:532:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:improvement on previous data used to study the effect of sentencing enhancements on criminal 
12:449:27666:21:21:72:509:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activity.  Much of the previous work uses aggregate crime rates relying on regional and/or 
12:450:27757:21:21:72:511:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:temporal variation to identify the effects of sentence enhancements. An exception to this is 
12:451:27850:21:21:72:507:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recent work by Helland and Tabborak (HT).  HT identify the effect of Three Strikes using 
12:452:27939:21:21:72:533:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:whether an individual is convicted of two versus one strikeable offense as an exogenous source 
12:453:28034:21:21:72:541:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of variation. There are several reasons why this identification may not be the best way to identify 
12:454:28134:21:21:72:222:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the effects of the law change.   
12:455:28167:21:21:108:539:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:First, to the extent that there are systematic differences in offenders with two convictions 
12:456:28260:21:21:72:530:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:versus one, estimates which only difference post-law change will tend to be biased.  While HT 
12:457:28354:21:21:72:495:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:tests this assumption in states without Three-Strikes law and find little difference, if the 
12:458:28447:21:21:72:538:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:willingness or ability of juries to convict individuals of strikeable offenses changes as a function 
12:459:28548:21:21:72:489:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the law, then HT’s tests will not be able to ascertain the validity of their identifying 
12:460:28640:21:21:72:534:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assumption.  Indeed, there appears to be a relationship between Three Strikes law on the rate of 
12:461:28737:21:21:72:542:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:negotiated sentences (plea bargains).  The fraction of cases decided by jury trial increased almost 
12:462:28837:21:21:72:521:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:10 percent after the enactment of Three Strikes.10 While I cannot causally relate this to Three 
12:463:28933:21:21:72:517:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes, discussions with district attorneys, defense attorneys and judges suggests that Three 
12:464:29028:21:21:72:540:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes law has been one of the primary causes for this increase in the rate of cases going to trial. 
12:465:29130:21:21:72:537:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Because they are likely to face a lengthy sentence regardless of a plea bargain, many defendants 
12:466:29227:21:21:72:495:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decide not to negotiate a plea bargain in second and third strike cases. Thus many more 
12:467:29315:21:21:72:514:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders choose to go to court in the hopes of avoiding a conviction altogether altering the 
12:468:29409:21:21:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:probability of conviction after the law change. Moreover, even if Three Strikes did not cause the 
12:469:29507:21:21:72:540:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:increase in trial rates, the concurrent change in sentencing law and trial rates makes it difficult to 
12:470:29610:21:21:72:381:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:separately identify the Three Strikes effect from other changes.  
12:471:29676:21:21:108:517:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Second, because of the nature of discretion in the criminal justice system, the further 
12:472:29764:21:21:72:539:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:along the process data is collected the more affected by discretion is the data.  Ideally, we would 
12:473:29864:21:21:72:529:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observe all of the criminals who commit crime regardless of detection.  Arrest is only one-step 
12:474:29960:21:19:72:542:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:removed from that as it requires only detection by police.  Cases brought to trial are several steps 
12:475:30061:19:8:72:219:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
12:476:30119:8:16:72:538:114:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:10 This is based on the estimates of the change in the probability of a jury trial conditional on being prosecuted for a 
12:477:30240:16:12:72:523:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:strikeable offense based on California Department of Justice statistics.  From the data used in this paper it is not 
12:478:30357:12:12:72:536:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:possible to observe whether criminals were convicted due to a plea bargain or by trial.  However, the probability of 
12:479:30474:12:0:72:398:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:conviction does change significantly after the law and this change varies by city. 
13:480:30564:0:21:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:removed, requiring the decision to prosecute, determination of sufficient evidence for trial by a 
13:481:30662:21:21:72:511:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:grand jury, and decision to go to trial.  Such discretion can be directly influence by the law 
13:482:30757:21:21:72:517:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change.  For instance, in some areas prosecutors sought Three Strikes enhancements only in 
13:483:30848:21:21:72:528:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:certain cases, such as for certain types of crimes that are particular problems in their county or 
13:484:30947:21:21:72:530:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:where the current offense is serious or violent. While in other counties, prosecutors seek Three 
13:485:31044:21:21:72:525:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes enhancements in most eligible cases. Similarly, after 1997, judges varied in how often 
13:486:31139:21:21:72:523:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:they dismiss prior strikes, based on discretion afforded to them under the Romero decision.11  
13:487:31234:21:21:108:541:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Third, there was a great deal of variation in the rate at which offenders who were arrested 
13:488:31326:21:21:72:523:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:faced penalties from Three-Strikes law.  A legislative analysis by Brown and Jolivette (2005) 
13:489:31420:21:21:72:527:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:noted considerable variation among counties in the likelihood that an offender who is arrested 
13:490:31515:21:21:72:539:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would be prosecuted and convicted under the Three Strikes law.  For example, Kern County was 
13:491:31608:21:21:72:535:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:over 13 times more likely to send an arrestee to state prison with a strike enhancement than San 
13:492:31705:21:21:72:499:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Francisco County. This variation makes it difficult to identify the effect of Three Strikes 
13:493:31797:21:21:72:366:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:penalties on offenders independent of prosecutorial conduct. 
13:494:31858:21:21:108:534:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The approach used in this analysis is to compare similar individuals who faced different 
13:495:31947:21:21:72:541:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strike eligibility before and after Three Strikes law was introduced.  If we could observe the  true 
13:496:32048:21:21:72:523:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:underlying propensity of individuals to commit a crime in the pre-Three-Strikes era, and then 
13:497:32142:21:21:72:492:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their propensity to commit a crime in the post-Three-Strikes era, we could attribute the 
13:498:32231:21:21:72:531:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference in the propensity to commit crime to the effect of harsher sentencing (either through 
13:499:32328:21:21:72:499:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:incapacitation or deterrence).  In practice it is not possible to observe an individuals true 
13:500:32422:21:21:72:498:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:probability of committing crime.  However, we can observe among individuals who had 
13:501:32506:21:21:72:527:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:previously committed a crime, whether their probability of committing another crime changes 
13:502:32598:21:21:72:496:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:after the law change.  Specifically, suppose that we believed the underlying distribution 
13:503:32688:21:21:72:535:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regarding the probability of recidivism was fixed over time except with respect to Three Strikes 
13:504:32785:21:21:72:501:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing.  Then if we observed in a change in the propensity to commit a crime among 
13:505:32872:21:21:72:538:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals who had previously committed crimes—that is a change in the propensity to commit 
13:506:32965:21:21:72:495:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a crime—then we can attribute that to the average deterrence effect from Three Strikes. 
13:507:33053:21:31:72:507:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In order to match plausibly similar individuals, I use an individual’s prior criminal 
13:508:33139:31:8:72:219:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
13:509:33197:8:16:72:518:102:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:11 On June 20, 1996, the state Supreme Court ruled in People v. Superior Court (Romero)that the court has the 
13:510:33307:16:12:72:540:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:discretion to dismiss prior serious or violent felony convictions under the Three Strikes law.  For a discussion of the 
13:511:33427:12:0:72:325:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:evolution of Three Strikes law see Brown and Jolivette (2005) 
14:512:33496:0:21:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:history (PCH) as the source of identification.12  Under Three strikes, individuals with the same 
14:513:33593:21:21:72:513:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal history, but different ordering of crimes have different sentencing eligibility.  This 
14:514:33689:21:21:72:511:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:mismatch between strikes and felonies arises because while all felony convictions count as 
14:515:33780:21:21:72:484:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strikes after the first strike, only certain felonies are covered as record aggravating or 
14:516:33871:21:21:72:515:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:“triggering” offenses (to give an individual a record-enhancing strike and evoke the harsher 
14:517:33964:21:21:72:521:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:penalties).   The list of record aggravating offenses is presented in Table 2.  Using this fact, I 
14:518:34063:21:21:72:524:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:assume that individuals with the same PCH variable have a fixed difference across time in all 
14:519:34157:21:21:71:538:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:respects except sentencing eligibility.  Comparing individuals with similar histories but different 
14:520:34257:21:21:71:532:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three Strikes eligibility before and after Three-Strikes provides a means to measure the change 
14:521:34353:21:21:71:517:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in propensity to commit crime as well as the change in propensity to commit a violent crime 
14:522:34445:21:21:71:226:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:associated with the law change. 
14:523:34477:21:21:71:546:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: To illustrate the identification strategy, consider the following example with two criminals 
14:524:34570:21:21:71:554:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:both of whom have previously committed a theft and a burglary.  Criminal A first committed a theft 
14:525:34669:21:21:71:542:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and then committed burglary.  Criminal B first committed a burglary and then committed a theft.  
14:526:34766:21:21:71:518:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Under sentencing guideline prior to Three-Strikes, both these individuals would face similar 
14:527:34859:21:21:71:523:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentencing eligibility if they committed a third offense.  However, after the Three-Strikes law 
14:528:34955:21:21:71:544:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change, the ordering of the crimes committed matters.  Because burglary is a triggering offense, it 
14:529:35055:21:21:71:557:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activates Three-Strikes sentencing.  All felonies committed after the activation of Three-Strikes then 
14:530:35158:21:21:71:544:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:count as strikes.  Thus, if individual A commits a new offense, that offense will count as a second 
14:531:35258:21:21:71:547:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strike since he has committed no offenses after the burglary.  In contrast, a new offense committed 
14:532:35358:21:21:71:512:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:by individual B will count as a third strike because he committed a theft after committing a 
14:533:35451:21:21:71:547:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:burglary.  Thus in the post-period, individuals A and B are exposed to different penalties based on 
14:534:35551:21:21:71:316:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the ordering of their previously committed crimes. 
14:535:35602:21:21:71:543:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Because there may be differences in the probability of committing a crime and the type of 
14:536:35692:21:21:71:532:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime committed by an individual who first commits a less serious crime and then more serious 
14:537:35786:21:21:71:524:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime relative to an individual who commits a more serious and then a less serious crime, it is 
14:538:35882:21:21:71:545:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:important to control for the baseline difference in propensity to commit crimes.  Thus I compare a 
14:539:35981:21:19:71:534:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pair of individuals A and B, before and after the law change.  I assume that a pair of individuals 
14:540:36080:19:8:72:219:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
14:541:36138:8:16:72:542:114:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:12 The prior criminal history (PCH) variable is a vector of indicator variables for the types of crimes committed prior 
14:542:36258:16:12:72:526:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:to the current offense, where prior crime categories are murder, rape, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, drugs, and 
14:543:36375:12:0:72:523:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:other miscellaneous felonies..  For example, an individual with two priors in burglary and theft would have non-
15:544:36494:0:21:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with the same criminal history but different orderings of those crimes have a fixed difference in 
15:545:36592:21:21:71:550:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:their probability of committing a new offense.  I will attribute the change in the difference between 
15:546:36694:21:21:71:515:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:these two individual’s propensity to commit a crime to Three Strikes sentencing eligibility.  
15:547:36785:21:21:107:536:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f5:There are two important exclusions in these data that may result in a mis-measured PCH 
15:548:36872:21:21:71:516:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure.  First, juvenile records were not included despite the fact that under Three-Strikes  
15:549:36967:21:21:71:527:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:juvenile offenses may count as a strike if they meet the statutory criteria.  Second, out-of-state 
15:550:37066:21:21:71:517:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:felonies count as a strike but are not documented in California arrest records.   Thus, while I 
15:551:37162:21:21:71:519:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:might observe individuals who exit the California criminal market, I cannot observe whether 
15:552:37254:21:21:71:517:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals committing offenses in California are first time offenders or migrants from other 
15:553:37348:21:21:71:541:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:states.  Barring these exclusions, this data provides a comprehensive set of information regarding 
15:554:37447:21:21:71:391:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals allowing relatively detailed comparison of offenders.   
15:555:37515:21:21:71:497:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In order to construct the PCH variable, I classify previous convictions into one of seven 
15:556:37605:21:21:71:517:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:categories: murder, rape, assault, robbery, burglary, theft (which includes larceny and motor 
15:557:37699:21:21:71:541:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:vehicle theft), drug crimes, and other crimes.  The definitions of these categories are presented in 
15:558:37800:21:21:71:526:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Table 3.  I then construct the PCH variable. PCH is a vector-valued variable which counts the 
15:559:37894:21:21:71:520:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:number of prior convictions in any of the seven offense categories. Returning to the example 
15:560:37987:21:21:71:445:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:above, both criminal’s A and B would have the same prior criminal histories  
15:561:38064:21:21:71:197:351:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:PCH = [0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0].   
15:562:38091:21:21:71:538:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  In general, it would be troublesome to use prior criminal history as a control variable for 
15:563:38184:21:21:71:532:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an individual’s innate propensity to commit crime, as the prior history itself may be affected by 
15:564:38282:21:21:71:528:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the law change.  That is, individuals may be deciding whether to commit crimes now based, in 
15:565:38375:21:21:71:539:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:part, on their effect on sentencing for future crimes. In order to avoid including this, I restrict the 
15:566:38479:21:21:71:538:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sample to individuals who committed their prior offenses before the law change (in 1994).  Thus 
15:567:38575:21:21:71:517:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the retroactive nature of Three Strikes makes the variation in PCH independent of enhanced 
15:568:38666:21:21:71:398:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentence eligibility in both the pre- and post-Three Strikes periods.  
15:569:38737:21:21:107:540:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In addition, because of the censoring that occurs for individuals who commit crimes prior 
15:570:38827:21:21:71:521:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to 1990, I restrict the analysis to offenders who committed at least one prior criminal activity

15:572:39012:21:21:71:326:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime pre-1990 and then never commit crime again.  
15:573:39063:21:20:71:526:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The above restrictions may generate the concern that individuals who commit crime in

16:576:39421:0:21:72:521:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the pre-period may be less crime prone than those in the post-period because the sample is in 
16:577:39515:21:21:72:483:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:part selected on the timeframe of an individuals criminal history.   To address this all 
16:578:39604:21:21:72:533:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:specifications include the felony rate per criminal year (FRCY). The FRCY provides a measure 
16:579:39697:21:21:71:537:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the combination of effect from youth and being a “crime-prone” individual.  Specifically, it is

16:588:40051:21:21:72:542:520:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The final sample restriction I impose is that I remove all offenders who are serving prison 
16:589:40143:21:21:72:540:499:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentences for the entire analysis period since by construction they cannot recidivate. Because the 
16:590:40242:21:21:72:514:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:time frame for recidivism used in the subsequent analysis is relatively short, this should not 
16:591:40337:21:21:72:465:457:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:systematically bias the propensity for recidivism before and after the law change. 
16:592:40420:21:21:108:521:436:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Summary statistics for the sample used in the analysis are reported in Table 2.  When 
16:593:40506:21:21:72:542:415:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:compared to the statewide criminal population (not reported), the sample differs from the general 
16:594:40604:21:21:72:529:394:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:population on key demographics.  The sample includes a high fraction of minorities especially 
16:595:40698:21:21:72:511:373:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:blacks than in the population on average.  The higher proportion of minorities is due to the 
16:596:40791:21:21:72:543:352:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sampling of cities and the higher proportion of blacks is due to the concentration of blacks in Los 
16:597:40891:21:21:72:520:331:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Angeles.  Comparing outcomes between the cities also yields some notable differences.  The 
16:598:40982:21:21:72:532:310:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:fraction of individuals charged with record aggravating offenses appears significantly higher in 
16:599:41079:21:21:72:530:289:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Los Angeles than in San Francisco and marginally higher than in San Diego. This is consistent 
16:600:41173:21:21:72:518:268:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with previous literature which suggests Los Angeles was more zealous in its enforcement of 
16:601:41264:21:21:72:526:247:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three Strikes.  Similarly, conviction rates of second-strike and third-strike eligible defendants 
16:602:41362:21:21:72:506:226:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:were significantly higher in both Los Angeles and San Diego, than in San Francisco. This 
16:603:41451:21:21:72:496:205:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difference declines after 1997 most likely due to the introduction of judicial discretion.

16:606:41601:8:16:72:521:150:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:13 This restriction may raise the concern that individuals in the pre-period were required to commit their current 
16:607:41716:16:12:72:537:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:offenses in more rapid succession than those in the post-period. If these are “worse” criminals in the sense that they 
16:608:41835:12:12:72:519:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:are more likely to recidivate than the reported estimates would tend to overstate the recidivism effects of Three 
16:609:41949:12:12:72:535:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Strikes Law.  Thus in addition to the FRCY inclusion, I test the sensitivity of the reported results to these sampling 
16:610:42068:12:12:72:530:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:restrictions in two ways.  First, I include all individuals regardless of the year in which their prior was committed. 
16:611:42187:12:12:72:538:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Second, I restrict the post sample to 1995-1996.  This creates a symmetric timing requirement for pre- and post-law 
16:612:42303:12:0:72:464:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:change samples.  Results are consistent across regression and are reported in Appendix Table 3.   
17:613:42408:0:21:291:353:708:144:Times:144:Times:4.  RESULTS 
17:614:42419:21:21:72:564:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Before looking at the estimated effect of Three Strikes on criminal activity, I verify that Three-
17:615:42517:21:21:72:566:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes resulted in sentencing differences by strike eligibility.  Table 3 reports the sentencing statistics 
17:616:42626:21:21:72:561:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:before and after Three-Strikes for offenders convicted after arrest.14  It appears that Three-Strikes did 
17:617:42732:21:21:72:561:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in fact double sentences on the second strike and dramatically increased sentences on the third strike, 
17:618:42836:21:21:72:572:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:as is required by law.  It is worth noting that there is no effect on sentence length for first-strike eligible 
17:619:42948:21:21:72:525:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders but these offenders do face different penalty profiles for future offenses (as noted in 
17:620:43046:21:21:72:529:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Shepherd 2001).    Moreover, while there is variation in the probability of conviction by cities, 
17:621:43144:21:21:72:530:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conditional on conviction there is no significant difference in the sentences faced by criminals.

17:623:43242:21:21:72:261:498:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:4.1 Estimating the Participation Effect 
17:624:43282:21:21:108:497:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:I define the participation effect of Three Strikes as a change in the probability of 
17:625:43367:21:21:72:507:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:committing a crime conditional on strike eligibility.  To motivate this interpretation of the 
17:626:43461:21:23:72:517:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:participation effect, consider a latent variable model where we define a variable Y* such that 
17:627:43556:23:24:135:530:412:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:UUYCrime−=*.  Then, assume that Y*, the difference in utility from criminal and non-criminal 
17:628:43649:24:21:72:531:388:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activity, is a function of strike eligibility, prior criminal history, and individual characteristics.  
17:629:43753:21:45:72:219:367:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Therefore, we can write Y* as:

17:647:44214:23:21:72:529:236:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:per criminal year. Although the latent variable, *Y is not observable, I can observe whether an 
17:648:44310:21:21:72:534:215:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individual chooses to commit a crime (call this variable Y).  The observed binary variable Y is 1

17:650:44509:21:21:71:513:173:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:chooses to commit a new crime before and after the law passage and use the difference as a 
17:651:44600:21:21:71:328:152:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure of the laws effect on criminal participation.  
17:652:44655:21:21:108:525:131:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Because the data is drawn using individuals who are currently under arrest, in order to

17:656:45032:12:0:72:327:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:of assault or drugs who have updated sentencing information.

18:658:45195:21:21:72:540:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eligibility affects the probability that they commit a crime at some point in the future.  For future 
18:659:45297:21:21:72:491:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crimes, an individual's true strike eligibility includes both the total number of previous 
18:660:45388:21:21:72:529:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:convictions and the current offense if convicted.  However, using the true strike eligibility as a 
18:661:45487:21:21:72:517:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:measure of the cost of a future crime is problematic for two main reasons.  First, individuals 
18:662:45582:21:21:72:533:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:arrested for a felony after the law change may have chosen the type of crime for which they are 
18:663:45678:21:21:72:516:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:currently under arrest in response to the law change.  The theoretical prediction that penalty 
18:664:45773:21:21:72:527:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:structure may affect the severity of the crime chosen after the law change makes including the 
18:665:45868:21:21:72:531:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:current offense as part of strike eligibility undesirable.  Second, because conviction after Three 
18:666:45967:21:21:72:516:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes appears to be affected by the law change, a measure of strike eligibility after the law 
18:667:46063:21:21:72:378:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change includes the endogenously changing conviction rates.    
18:668:46126:21:21:108:537:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus in order to predict the effect of strike eligibility on the probability of recidivating, I 
18:669:46222:21:21:72:538:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:use an individual’s strike eligibility based on his/her prior criminal history committed before the 
18:670:46322:21:21:72:509:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:law change as an instrument for an individual’s true strike eligibility.  In order to do this, I 
18:671:46419:21:21:72:536:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:construct an individual’s true strike eligibility as determined by their strike eligibility from their 
18:672:46522:21:21:72:515:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:prior criminal history plus an additional strike if they were convicted of a strikeable offense 
18:673:46618:21:21:72:527:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(either a felony if Three Strikes was already triggered or a triggering offense). I then construct 
18:674:46717:21:21:72:517:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:four indicators: second strike eligible (strikes2), third strike eligible (strikes3), second strike 
18:675:46817:21:21:72:516:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:eligible after 1994 (after*strikes2) and third strike eligible after 1994 (after*strikes3). I also 
18:676:46916:21:21:71:537:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:construct a PCH based strike eligibility by counting the number of strikes acquired in the period 
18:677:47014:21:21:71:451:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pre-1994. Then I define the PCH based indicators: strikes2_pch, strikes3_pch, 
18:678:47092:21:21:72:490:267:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f1:after*strikes2_pch, after*strikes3_pch which count the number of strikes based on the 
18:679:47178:21:21:72:538:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals prior criminal activity excluding the crime for which they are currently under arrest.  
18:680:47277:21:21:72:528:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Using these PCH based strike counts, I estimate a first stage of this regression and instrument 
18:681:47374:21:21:71:517:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:for strikes2, strikes3, after*strikes2, after*strikes3 in equation 7.  The t-statistics for all first 
18:682:47476:21:21:71:287:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:stages are significant at the 1 percent level.   
18:683:47525:21:21:107:525:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The data used spans 1990-1999 and thus individuals toward the end for the time series 
18:684:47611:21:21:71:528:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:will be censored. To limit the fraction of the sample that is censored, I estimate the probability 
18:685:47710:21:22:71:534:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that an individual recidivates within 2-years of his/her release.15  The results of this analysis are 
18:686:47812:22:8:72:219:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
18:687:47870:8:16:72:539:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:15 The choice of 2 years was based on criminology literature which suggests that most offenders who recidivate will 
18:688:47986:16:0:72:529:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:do so within 2 years of their release from prison.  The results presented are not very sensitive to the length of this 
19:689:48112:0:21:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:presented in table 4.  Columns (1) and (2) compare the OLS and the instrumental variables (IV) 
19:690:48207:21:21:72:535:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:regressions.  The OLS appears to be upward biased consistent with a change in the composition 
19:691:48301:21:21:72:523:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of offenders convicted after Three Strikes changes.  If the offenders convicted after the Three 
19:692:48397:21:21:72:510:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes law change were less likely to recidivate then the post-Three Strikes cohorts would 
19:693:48489:21:21:71:507:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:include some individuals with a lower propensity to recidivate. Thus, some of the reduced 
19:694:48579:21:21:71:528:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:recidivism from the compositional change in Three-Strikes conviction rates is attributed to the 
19:695:48675:21:21:71:517:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:behavioral response of criminals.  The instrumental variable estimate implies a 9 percentage 
19:696:48768:21:21:71:509:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:point (18 percent) reduction in the probability of recidivating among second strike eligible 
19:697:48861:21:21:71:489:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders. The effect for third strike eligible offenders is higher, corresponding to a 14 
19:698:48952:21:21:71:538:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:percentage points or 28 percent reduction. Column (3) includes additional controls for economic 
19:699:49048:21:21:71:530:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:factors and criminal justice expenditures.  The estimates appear robust to the inclusion of these 
19:700:49146:21:21:71:172:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:additional variables. 
19:701:49168:21:21:108:513:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  To test how the stringency of enforcement affects the deterrent effect, columns (4) 
19:702:49254:21:21:71:530:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:through (8) report the OLS and IV estimates by city.  Because a proportionally high fraction of 
19:703:49350:21:21:71:512:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the total number of offenders come from Los Angeles, the results from Los Angeles appear 
19:704:49439:21:21:71:524:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:consistent with those in the Three City sample.  There does appear a slightly larger difference 
19:705:49535:21:21:71:539:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:between the IV and OLS estimates in Los Angeles relative to either San Diego or San Francisco. 
19:706:49630:21:21:71:537:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In San Diego, the IV is smaller than the OLS estimate, consistent with the pooled results. In San 
19:707:49728:21:21:71:529:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Francisco, however, the OLS estimates are smaller than the IV estimates.  If they are different, 
19:708:49825:21:21:71:523:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:this would suggest that discretionary use of Three Strikes is resulting in worse criminal being 
19:709:49921:21:21:71:515:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentenced under Three Strikes’ harsher sentencing.  However, because of the large standard 
19:710:50012:21:21:71:386:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:errors I cannot reject that the IV and the OLS are the same size.

19:712:50082:21:21:71:245:225:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:4.2 Estimating the Migration Effect 
19:713:50118:21:21:108:535:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:While the lower probability of recidivating may be due to reduced participation, another 
19:714:50207:21:21:71:494:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:less-desirable way in which crime in California might decline is the migration of repeat 
19:715:50296:21:21:71:535:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders into other states in order to commit crimes.  Indeed the probability that a criminal will 
19:716:50396:21:21:71:507:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:commit crime outside of California increased significantly after the Three Strikes law was 
19:717:50487:21:21:71:540:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:introduced.  However, because migration might be increasing generally during this time period, I 
19:718:50584:21:19:71:531:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:estimate two specifications attempting to identify the impact of Three Strikes law on inter-state 
19:719:50682:19:12:72:542:80:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:

20:722:50990:21:21:108:536:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:First, I estimate the propensity for criminals to commit crime in California, as a function 
20:723:51082:21:43:72:458:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of strike eligibility, before and after Three-Strikes law.  Specifically, I estimate:

20:736:51308:40:21:72:536:602:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Again to account for the endogeneity of conviction rates in the post-Three Strikes time period, I 
20:737:51406:21:21:72:534:581:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:instrument for strike eligibility using the criminal history.  The results are presented in columns 
20:738:51506:21:21:72:488:560:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:(1) through (3) of table 5.  The results show a larger participation effect of individuals 
20:739:51597:21:21:72:517:539:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:committing crime within California.  Thus there appears to be a participation effect separate 
20:740:51691:21:21:72:533:518:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from the migration effect and the migration effect moves in the opposite direction as the within-
20:741:51788:21:21:72:194:497:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:state participation effect. 
20:742:51816:21:21:108:489:476:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:I next estimate the relationship between strike eligibility and the probability of 
20:743:51899:21:21:72:535:455:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:committing crime outside of California conditional on recidivating as specified in equation (8).  
20:744:51997:21:21:72:516:434:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Consistent with the notion that criminals facing second and especially third strike eligibility 
20:745:52093:21:21:72:520:413:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:migrate to other states, I find a 6 percentage point increase in migration among second strike 
20:746:52188:21:21:72:535:392:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders and an 8.5 percentage point change among third strike offenders.  Thus it appears that 
20:747:52285:21:21:72:543:371:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among offenders committing new crimes, a growing fraction commit those crimes in other states. 
20:748:52380:21:21:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:  The overall migration effect is smaller in magnitude than within state participation but large 
20:749:52477:21:21:72:533:329:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relative to the fraction of individuals who migrated to conduct criminal activity prior to the law 
20:750:52576:21:21:72:118:308:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:change.   
20:751:52586:21:21:108:529:287:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In the sample, the two most frequent states to which criminals migrate are Nevada and 
20:752:52673:21:21:72:540:266:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Arizona.  Nevada’s equivalent of Three-Strikes law applies only for violent offenses and appears 
20:753:52770:21:21:72:526:245:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to be rarely invoked.16  Arizona does not have habitual offender legislation.  It is worth noting 
20:754:52868:21:21:72:499:224:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that these results are likely a lower bound on the estimated probability of migrating.  An 
20:755:52959:21:21:72:542:203:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individual shows up in the data as having committed a crime in another state if that state requests 
20:756:53059:21:21:72:532:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal records.  Because many states may not request criminal records for low-level felonies, 
20:757:53155:21:21:72:473:161:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:some individuals who migrate out and commit crimes will not appear in this data.

20:761:53296:8:16:72:517:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:16 Numerous articles and anecdotal evidence suggest that except in California, Three Strikes statutes are rarely 
20:762:53409:16:0:72:281:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:invoked.  See for example New York Times (1996)

21:764:53505:21:21:72:522:687:100:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: While Three-Strikes appears to have had the anticipated effect of reducing recidivism 
21:765:53591:21:21:72:494:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:among strike-eligible offenders, it may also have an effect on the distribution of crimes

21:788:54522:21:21:72:546:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:observations on crime choices, I can estimate the change in the distribution of crime types, i.e. the 
21:789:54624:21:21:72:561:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:marginal deterrence effect.  Note that the identification in equation (9) comes solely from individuals 
21:790:54728:21:21:72:561:384:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with the same prior criminal history facing differing strike eligibility.  Because the sampling requires 
21:791:54833:21:21:72:560:363:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:that all individuals have current offenses, I can use all individuals with a pre-period determined PCH 
21:792:54935:21:21:72:564:342:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and estimate the change in the crime severity differential probability before and after the law change.  
21:793:55040:21:21:72:534:321:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus unlike in the general participation estimates it is not necessary to estimate an instrumental 
21:794:55139:21:21:72:185:300:144:g_d0_f1:144:Times:variables specification. 
21:795:55163:21:21:72:550:279:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Table 6 reports the results of these regressions.  Column (1) reports coefficients for a linear 
21:796:55259:21:21:72:556:258:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:model with the outcome as whether an individual committed a violent crime or not.  The estimate of 
21:797:55358:21:21:72:545:237:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:propensity to commit violent crime indicates that second strike eligible individuals who choose to 
21:798:55457:21:21:72:563:216:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:commit a felony after Three-Strikes was passed are about 4 percentage points more likely to choose a 
21:799:55558:21:21:72:558:195:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:violent crime over a nonviolent crime than their counterparts were prior to Three-Strikes.  Similarly, 
21:800:55661:21:21:72:557:174:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:third-strike eligible individuals are about 10 percentage points more likely to commit violent crime.  
21:801:55764:21:21:72:559:153:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The similar effect on second strike eligible offenders suggests that the doubling of penalties does not 
21:802:55868:21:21:72:573:132:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:simply create a higher marginal cost of severity across the board but rather appears to flatten the cost of 
21:803:55976:21:21:72:568:111:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:more serious crime, possibly due to concavity in the cost function of criminals.    Columns 2 through 8 
21:804:56080:21:0:72:550:90:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in Table 6 provide estimates of the probability of committing a given type of crime (conditional on 
22:805:56187:0:21:72:568:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:committing crime). Third strike eligible offenders are more likely to commit rape and robbery and less 
22:806:56290:21:21:72:566:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to commit burglary and theft.  Among second strike eligible offenders the pattern was very similar but 
22:807:56393:21:21:72:568:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with no significant decline in theft rates.  Because burglary is record aggravating offense despite being 
22:808:56499:21:21:72:572:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:nonviolent, offenders who commit crime may be seeking a greater “bang for their buck” by committing 
22:809:56599:21:21:72:558:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:higher payoff, and therefore more violent, crimes.  There also appears to be fewer substitutions from 
22:810:56701:21:21:72:509:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:burglary but more substitutions from theft among third strike eligible offenders. 17     
22:811:56790:21:21:72:559:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Overall these results seem consistent with the theory that by eliminating marginal deterrence, 
22:812:56885:21:21:72:528:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three-Strikes resulted in a crime distribution that is skewed towards more violent crimes.  For 
22:813:56981:21:21:72:547:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:example, the decrease in murder given Three-Strikes seems reasonable since premeditated murder 
22:814:57076:21:21:72:571:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:activates the death penalty, thus preserving marginal deterrence.  Therefore, conditional on committing 
22:815:57180:21:21:72:556:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a violent crime, criminals should substitute away from murder to assault or robbery.  The shift away 
22:816:57281:21:21:72:562:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:from non-violent crime towards assault or robbery also seems consistent with the theory the marginal 
22:817:57382:21:21:72:538:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:deterrence is relevant.  The most compelling evidence appears in the increase in robbery and the 
22:818:57479:21:21:72:536:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:decrease in burglary.  Robbery and burglary are similar crimes in terms of goal, but differ in the 
22:819:57578:21:21:72:561:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:element of force. Moreover, both offenses are record aggravating, which means they generate similar 
22:820:57678:21:21:72:175:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:sentence eligibility.   
22:821:57702:21:21:72:560:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: One alternative explanation for these results is that police officers began charging individuals 
22:822:57799:21:21:72:564:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:with more serious crimes after the passage of Three-Strikes law.  If this is correct, then the type of the 
22:823:57906:21:21:72:559:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crimes committed before and after Three-Strikes are the same and instead police discretion about the 
22:824:58007:21:21:72:551:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crime with which an offender is charged resulted in more serious charges for Three-Strikes eligible 
22:825:58107:21:21:72:555:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:arrestees. While the use of discretion for an arrest is plausible, it is checked in part by the need for a 
22:826:58214:21:21:72:551:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:judicial arrest warrant.  Because the charges for violent felonies, like murder, rape and robbery, are 
22:827:58317:21:21:72:540:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:difficult to compare to any nonviolent or misdemeanor crime it is difficult to imagine that judges 
22:828:58416:21:21:72:556:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:would sanction the substitution of felony charges for lesser degree crimes. Discretion could apply in 
22:829:58518:21:21:72:526:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cases where individuals are arrested during the commission of a crime or during other exigent 
22:830:58612:21:21:72:572:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:circumstances.  However, in these cases it is unlikely that officers would know the strike eligibility of a 
22:831:58720:21:28:72:561:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:particular individual.18    Moreover, it is not necessarily clear that officers would have an incentive to 
22:832:58827:28:8:72:219:134:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                           
22:833:58885:8:16:72:533:126:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:17 These results appear to be linked to Three Strikes law change. I performed falsification checks to test the timing 
22:834:59003:16:12:72:528:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:of the shift in severity by limiting the data to 1990-1993, pre-law change. I artificially assign 1992 as the placebo 
22:835:59121:12:12:72:508:98:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:year of law change and find no significant changes when estimating the regression equation (9).  Results are 
22:836:59230:12:8:72:201:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:presented in Appendix Table 4. 
22:837:59261:8:0:72:541:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:18 This theory would be of greater concern with indictment or conviction level data, where charges often reflect both 
23:838:59386:0:21:72:553:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:charge more serious crimes.  They might charge less serious crimes after Three Strikes to offenders 
23:839:59486:21:21:72:550:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:who they perceive as less dangerous, which would bias against the results presented in this paper.   
23:840:59587:21:21:108:535:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Another alternative explanation consistent with the results presented in this paper is that 
23:841:59679:21:21:72:528:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:offenders for non-violent crime are disproportionately deterred from committing crime.  Thus, 
23:842:59773:21:21:72:512:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rather than a substitution effect, the results simply indicate the relative composition effect.  
23:843:59870:21:21:72:527:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Consistent with this view, the unconditional probability of any offense declines, albeit less for 
23:844:59968:21:21:72:511:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:violent than for non-violent crime.  Specifically three-quarters of the decline in crime rates 
23:845:60063:21:21:72:514:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:appear to be due to the reduction in criminal participation by non-violent offenders.19  Such 
23:846:60157:21:21:72:526:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:results are consistent with a story where violent criminals are less able to be deterred and thus 
23:847:60255:21:21:72:504:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enhanced sentencing reduces non-violent crime while keeping violent crime more-or-less 
23:848:60342:21:21:72:523:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:constant. This would produce results similar to those reported in Tables 5 and 6.  While there 
23:849:60437:21:21:72:543:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:does not appear to be a systematic way to disentangle the substitution story from the composition 
23:850:60535:21:21:72:491:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:story, I marshal some evidence that suggests that at least some of the effects are due to 
23:851:60625:21:21:72:525:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:substitution.  First, there also appears to be a change in the types of crimes committed by first-
23:852:60723:21:21:72:534:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:strike eligible offenders.  The probability that a first-strike eligible offender committed a record 
23:853:60824:21:21:72:524:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aggravating offense declined significantly by 8 percentage points (12 percent).20 Under Three 
23:854:60918:21:21:72:539:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Strikes the penalty associated with a triggering offense could be higher for individuals expecting 
23:855:61017:21:21:72:529:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to engage in criminal activity over their lifetime.  For these criminals, substituting from record 
23:856:61116:21:21:72:537:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aggravating to non-record aggravating offenses is consistent with the crime severity substitution 
23:857:61214:21:21:72:527:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect.   Second, the change in nature of the violent crimes being committed in the post-period 
23:858:61310:21:21:72:540:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:appears more consistent with a substitution story than a compositional story.  The increase in the 
23:859:61409:21:21:72:518:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:conditional likelihood to commit violent crime appears entirely driven by robbery and rape.  
23:860:61502:21:21:72:534:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Thus, the compositional story would require a deterrent effect largely from burglary that results 
23:861:61600:21:21:72:538:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:in the post-Three Strikes distribution being higher only in these two crimes.  Finally, an analysis 
23:862:61700:21:21:72:540:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of lesser-included charges, when looking at the fraction of rapes and assaults which occur during 
23:863:61798:21:21:72:523:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:non-violent crimes in the post-period, there appears to be a significant increase in these rapes 
23:864:61895:21:21:72:517:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relative to other forms of rapes or assault. Table 7 reports the results from this analysis.  For 
23:865:61993:21:19:72:537:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:rapes, lesser-included chargers of other sex-offenses remain relatively constant while rapes with 
23:866:62091:19:12:72:542:122:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:                                                                                                                                                                                           
23:867:62277:12:8:71:466:110:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:the nature of the crime and a bargaining position for plea negotiations.  Kesseler and Piehl (1998) 
23:868:62377:8:12:72:460:102:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:19 This claim is based on estimating equation (7) separately for violent and non-violent offenses. 
23:869:62476:12:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:20 This evidence is consistent with results in Shepherd (2001) which finds reduced levels of triggering offenses in a 
23:870:62594:16:0:72:227:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:structural model using aggregate data. 
24:871:62640:0:21:72:513:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:lesser-included charges of burglary and theft crimes increase.  Similarly, assaults with theft 
24:872:62735:21:21:72:535:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:related lesser-included-charges increase while assaults with no lesser-included charges decline.  
24:873:62833:21:21:72:494:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This combined with the increase in robberies is suggestive of the fact that at least some 
24:874:62923:21:21:71:524:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:individuals may be switching from committing burglary to robbery or may be more willing to 
24:875:63014:21:21:71:346:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:commit a rape or assault during the course of a burglary. 
24:876:63072:21:21:71:533:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Additionally, the compositional explanation for behavior does not diminish the need for 
24:877:63160:21:21:71:563:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:marginal deterrence.  If offenders who commit violent crimes receive higher payoffs for these crimes, 
24:878:63262:21:21:71:557:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:then harsher penalties are still required to deter these criminals. Thus coincident with this alternative 
24:879:63368:21:21:71:542:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:theory is an alternative justification for maintaining a penalty gradient: proportional sentencing is 
24:880:63470:21:21:71:563:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:necessary to ensure that violent crimes are deterred.  This bears directly on the cost-effectiveness of a 
24:881:63576:21:21:71:514:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:an enhanced sentencing policy, but requires a relative valuation of violent, non-violent, and 
24:882:63670:21:21:71:568:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:incarceration costs which are beyond the scope of this paper.  However, if this explanation of behavior 
24:883:63774:21:21:71:565:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:is true, then Three Strikes did not encourage any crime that would not have occurred in the absence of 
24:884:63877:21:21:71:326:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:Three Strikes, it simply failed to deter violent crime. 
24:885:63933:21:21:320:323:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: 
24:886:63933:21:21:255:389:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:5. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
24:887:63953:21:21:72:544:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: This study presents evidence that an increase in the severity of penalties for all crimes can 
24:888:64047:21:21:72:509:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:generate competing effects.  On the one hand, as intended, such a policy appears to reduce 
24:889:64138:21:21:72:572:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:participation in criminal activity.  In the case of habitual offender legislation such as Three-Strikes, this 
24:890:64248:21:21:72:522:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:effect appears to be especially concentrated among repeat offenders. Such an effect produces 
24:891:64341:21:21:72:562:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:unambiguous social gains.  On the other hand, the broad enhancement of penalty severity reduces the 
24:892:64441:21:21:72:563:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:cost of more severe crimes (such as violent crimes) relative to less severe crimes (such as non-violent 
24:893:64545:21:21:72:557:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:crimes).  This produces a social cost for societies who have a distaste for more severe crimes.  Thus, 
24:894:64648:21:21:72:572:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:while the overall effect of a sentence enhancement may be a reduction in crime levels, the cost in terms 
24:895:64753:21:21:72:569:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of a higher fraction of violent crimes may be unpalatable.  This study provides additional evidence that 
24:896:64858:21:21:72:572:183:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminals, when faced with harsh penalties in one area, may migrate to other less costly locations.  This 
24:897:64964:21:21:72:569:162:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:result is especially important when considering the efficacy of crime laws which are passed at the state 
24:898:65069:21:21:72:561:141:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:level. If these laws do littler more than beggar thy neighbor by shifting the worst criminals across the 
24:899:65174:21:21:72:518:120:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:border, then harsh sentencing regimes may not produce the anticipated reduction in criminal 
24:900:65266:21:21:72:457:99:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:participation but rather will only serve to shift criminal activity across borders.  
24:901:65351:21:0:72:532:78:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: In order to better compare the participation, severity, and migration effects, I attempt to 
25:902:65450:0:21:72:570:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:quantify and monetize the estimates of crimes reduced.  Based on the estimates presented in this paper, 
25:903:65554:21:21:72:560:687:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:it appears that on average 148,000 non-violent crimes and 74,000 violent crimes were not committed 
25:904:65653:21:21:72:570:666:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:each year due to the participation effect of the law change.  However, the escalating severity due to the 
25:905:65759:21:21:72:535:645:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:removal of proportional sentencing resulted in 21,000 additional violent crimes annually. Using 
25:906:65855:21:21:72:572:624:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:monetized estimates of the cost of crime by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, I estimate that this amounts 
25:907:65962:21:21:72:548:603:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:to $193 million dollars.21  A legislative analysis of Three Strikes estimated that the operating costs 
25:908:66065:21:21:72:571:582:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:resulting from Three Strikes law is nearly one-half billion dollars annually.22  Thus while Three-Strikes 
25:909:66171:21:21:72:556:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:does appear to be effective at deterring crime, the substitution from non-violent to violent crime and 
25:910:66274:21:21:72:533:540:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the high cost of incarceration make the law a somewhat costly strategy to reduce crime levels.   
25:911:66371:21:21:72:527:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: Separate from the within state effectiveness of Three-Strikes is the effect of such harsh 
25:912:66461:21:21:72:561:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:penalties on other states.  Three Strikes appears to have imposed 50,000 crimes on other states due to 
25:913:66564:21:21:72:565:477:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:the migration of criminals out of California. Such an affect appears to have been largely unanticipated 
25:914:66668:21:21:72:546:456:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:and may be extremely costly for other states, especially if the destination states are ill-equipped to 
25:915:66771:21:21:72:540:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:handle an influx of criminals.  This effect is particularly important when considering the types of 
25:916:66871:21:21:72:570:414:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:criminal justice policies advocated because most of these policies occur at the state level.  If these laws 
25:917:66979:21:21:72:540:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:are successful in part because they transfer criminal activity across borders then while politically 
25:918:67080:21:21:72:268:372:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:successfully they maybe socially costly. 
25:919:67121:21:21:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1: The evidence provided in this study highlights the responsiveness of criminals, especially 
25:920:67212:21:21:72:554:330:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:repeat offenders, to incentive-based penalty schemes.  Individuals appear to choose both whether to 
25:921:67312:21:21:72:564:309:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:participate as well as the form of the participation as a function of the penalty structure.  While it may 
25:922:67419:21:21:72:536:288:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:be surprising that criminals respond so sharply to incentives, sociological evidence (e.g. Shafer) 
25:923:67518:21:21:72:564:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:suggests that criminals are aware of the sentencing structure and their own eligibility for punishment.  
25:924:67623:21:21:72:513:246:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:The nuanced responsiveness of criminals to smaller enhancements and the effects of strong 
25:925:67713:21:21:72:566:225:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:enhancements that preserve proportionality with respect to severity are not estimated in this paper and 
25:926:67817:21:70:72:238:204:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:left as an area of future research.

25:928:67913:8:16:72:524:126:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:21 Cost estimates are weighted average of estimated costs for types of crimes from Miller, Cohen, and Wiersema

25:930:68049:8:16:72:542:102:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:22 These estimates are substantially smaller than the estimates presented in previous work (such as Greenwood et al.) 
25:931:68167:16:12:72:529:86:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1: The primary reason for the difference is the effect of discretion (i.e. the use of judicial discretion to dismiss prior 
25:932:68288:12:0:72:491:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:strikes and variation among counties in willingness to prosecute offenders under the Three Strikes law.)
