2:27:1388:28:14:72:539:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the effects of abolishing estate taxation in a quantitative and realistic framework that includes
2:28:1494:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:the key features that policy makers are worried about: business investment, borrowing constraints,
2:29:1592:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:estate transmission, and wealth inequality. We use our model to estimate effective estate taxation.
2:30:1691:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:We consider various tax instruments to reestablish fiscal balance when abolishing estate taxation. We
2:31:1792:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:find that abolishing estate taxation would not generate large increases in inequality, and would, in
2:32:1892:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:some cases, generate increases in aggregate output and capital accumulation. If, however, the resulting
2:33:1995:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:revenue shortfall were financed through increased income or consumption taxation, the immensely
2:34:2090:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:rich, and the old among those in particular, would experience a welfare gain, at the cost of welfare
2:35:2190:14:28:72:289:476:12:Times:12:Times:losses for the vast majority of the population.

3:47:2481:0:37:100:236:654:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:48:2496:37:20:100:497:617:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since its introduction in 1916 the estate tax has been one of the most contro-
3:49:2574:20:23:100:321:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:versial taxes in the United States tax code.
3:50:2618:23:20:117:496:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The estate tax opponents call it the “death tax”. Among the legislators
3:51:2689:20:20:100:497:554:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supporting the abolition of the estate tax, representative RonPaul (14th dis-
3:52:2766:20:20:100:497:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trict of Texas) states: “The estate tax is immoral and counter-productive. ...
3:53:2844:20:21:100:496:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:My office has received hundreds of letters and emails from individuals and
3:54:2918:21:20:100:497:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:small business owners in my district.  Theses people are not rich, but they
3:55:2993:20:20:100:497:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have worked hard and saved to create an inheritance for their children...” Sen-
3:56:3072:20:20:100:497:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ator Patty Murray, from Washington State, states “I believe that we need to
3:57:3147:20:20:100:496:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:repeal the estate tax. It is bad for businesses. It’s bad for workers and new job
3:58:3228:20:21:100:497:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:creation.” President George W. Bush shares this view “The deathtax results
3:59:3302:21:20:100:497:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in unfair double taxation of income and it hurts America’s small businesses,
3:60:3378:20:22:100:293:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which are the engine of job creation.”
3:61:3416:22:21:117:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The estate tax supporters see the estate tax as an extremely progressive
3:62:3488:21:20:100:496:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tax and a very effective effective way to tax the richest (and dead) few. Rep-
3:63:3566:20:20:100:496:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:resentative Bart Stupak (1st district of Michigan) states “I have continuously
3:64:3644:20:20:100:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:supported reforming the estate tax, but a complete repeal is fiscally irrespon-
3:65:3723:20:21:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sible, and serves to benefit only mega multi-millionaires while harming our
3:66:3798:21:20:100:496:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economy...”. Former Senator Tom Daschle, South Dakota adds “Do we really
3:67:3870:20:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have to protect the billionaires? We are talking about the richest 2%.” The
3:68:3945:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate tax supporters thus seem to believe that reducing estate taxation is a
3:69:4022:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“Paris Hilton Benefit Tax Act,” meaning that reduced estate taxes only ben-
3:70:4097:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:efit the heiresses and heirs of the largest fortunes in the country, rather than
3:71:4177:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:benefiting small entrepreneurs and family businesses. They also point out that
3:72:4255:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the abolition of the “death tax” would imply replacing a tax on few rich and
4:73:4332:0:21:100:336:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dead people with a “birth tax” on all citizens.
4:74:4379:21:20:117:497:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper studies the effects of abolishing estate taxation using a model
4:75:4453:20:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that explicitly studies entrepreneurial entry, continuation decisions, investment
4:76:4534:20:20:100:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and job creation, and transmission of estates across generations.While cali-
4:77:4610:20:21:100:496:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:brated to match some other key aspects of the data, this framework matches
4:78:4684:21:20:100:497:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the observed wealth inequality and wealth mobility for both entrepreneurs and
4:79:4761:20:20:100:411:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:workers, and replicates the observed consumption inequality.
4:80:4821:20:21:117:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We use our framework to provide a measure of effective estate taxation
4:81:4891:21:20:100:497:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by matching aggregate estate taxes paid as a fraction of output and the frac-
4:82:4968:20:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion of estates that pay estate taxes. Given that our model provides such a
4:83:5043:20:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:good fit of observed net worth holdings, we argue that this is a good way to
4:84:5119:20:20:100:497:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:measure effective estate taxation. We find that the current statutory estate
4:85:5195:20:21:100:497:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:taxation code implies a large effective exemption level (about 5 million dol-
4:86:5272:21:20:100:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lars per household), and a fairly low effective marginal tax rate (16%). These
4:87:5350:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:numbers are consistent with people rationally using legal exemptions, special
4:88:5427:20:20:100:496:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:provisions, and favorable valuation methods to lower the estate tax burden,
4:89:5502:20:21:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and with previous estimates which used various other methods to estimate
4:90:5574:21:20:100:496:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the schedule for the effective estate tax (see Gale, Hines and Slemrod for an
4:91:5651:20:20:100:496:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:overview [17]). They are also consistent with previous arguments according to
4:92:5728:20:20:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which the exemption level is high enough to imply that the impact of estate
4:93:5803:20:20:100:497:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:taxes on family farms and businesses is not a major concern for most estates
4:94:5879:20:21:100:380:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(see for example Harl [24] and Gale and Slemrod [19]).
4:95:5933:21:20:117:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We use our calibrated model to evaluate the aggregate and distributional
4:96:6005:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effects of abolishing estate taxation. We compute the steady states before and
4:97:6083:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:after abolishing estate taxes, and the transition path of the economy between
4:98:6160:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:steady states. We consider alternative fiscal policies to reestablish fiscal bal-
4:99:6241:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ance when estate taxation is eliminated. First, we allow the government to
5:100:6316:0:20:100:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cut government spending. Since government spending is unproductive in our
5:101:6389:20:21:100:496:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:framework, this should be the the scenario that is most favorable for abolish-
5:102:6467:21:20:100:496:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing estate taxes. Second, the government increases the tax on consumption.
5:103:6541:20:20:100:392:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Third, the government increases the tax on total income.
5:104:6597:20:21:117:496:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We find that the effect of these policies on long-run inequality(both in
5:105:6669:21:20:100:321:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:terms of consumption and wealth) is small.
5:106:6711:20:20:117:496:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In contrast, the steady state aggregate effects on output and capital are
5:107:6784:20:21:100:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:positive and significant, compared to the small revenue raised bythe estate
5:108:6859:21:20:100:497:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and gift taxes (which is about 0.3% of GDP) when either government spending
5:109:6934:20:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is cut, or when the tax rate on consumption is increased. Under those policies,
5:110:7013:20:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:aggregate output goes up by 1%-1.5%, while aggregate capital increases by
5:111:7086:20:20:100:496:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.5%. The aggregate effects are instead much smaller when the tax rate on
5:112:7159:20:21:100:497:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:total income is increased. Even if the income tax increase required to make
5:113:7234:21:20:100:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:up for the shortfall in estate taxes is very small, this increasedtax burden
5:114:7310:20:20:100:496:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decreases the return from running a business. The majority of entrepreneurs
5:115:7385:20:20:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would hence run their productive technologies on a smaller scale, which would
5:116:7462:20:21:100:368:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:imply smaller gains in aggregate output and capital.
5:117:7514:21:20:117:497:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These reforms have significant distributional implications. Looking at the
5:118:7588:20:20:100:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:welfare implications for the individual households, unsurprisingly the reform in
5:119:7668:20:21:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:which wasteful government spending is cut, is the reform that casts abolishing
5:120:7746:21:20:100:496:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate taxation in the most favorable light. In that case, increased investment
5:121:7825:20:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by the entrepreneurs increases capital, and hence wages. Wages are the largest
5:122:7903:20:20:100:496:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:source of income for most of the population, therefore most of the households
5:123:7980:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:experience a welfare gain from this reform. The super-rich, and especially the
5:124:8058:20:21:100:496:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:old, benefit from the reduction in estate taxation. The rich who were below
5:125:8133:21:20:100:496:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the estate taxation threshold before the reform, however, loose, because they
5:126:8210:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:receive a large fraction of income as capital income, and theinterest rate goes
6:127:8290:0:20:100:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:down due to the increase in entrepreneurial savings and aggregate capital.
6:128:8364:20:21:100:496:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:About 80% of the young and 90% of the old households benefit from this re-
6:129:8438:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:form, with an average welfare gain of the order or 0.2% of yearly consumption.

6:131:8587:20:21:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to make up from the budget shortfall from abolishing estate taxation, instead,
6:132:8665:21:20:100:497:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:generate small welfare costs (of at most 1% of yearly consumption) for the
6:133:8739:20:20:100:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vast majority of the population, while generating sizeable welfare gains for the
6:134:8819:20:20:100:496:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:richest few, and for the richest old in particular (on the orderof 6% of yearly
6:135:8898:20:20:100:497:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consumption). The average welfare costs of these reforms are about 0.2-0.3%
6:136:8973:20:21:100:217:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of yearly consumption.
6:137:8995:21:20:117:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our results thus suggest that most households alive today would find in
6:138:9066:20:20:100:497:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their interest to oppose a reform in which a consumption or income tax were
6:139:9141:20:21:100:493:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:raised to compensate for decreased revenues from abolishing estate taxation.
6:140:9217:21:20:117:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first work that evaluates
6:141:9289:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate taxation reforms by using a quantitative, general equilibrium model
6:142:9363:20:20:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that takes into account the effects of the reforms on the key channels that
6:143:9438:20:21:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:most worry legislators: wealth inequality, business activity, aggregate activity
6:144:9518:21:20:100:497:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at large, and estate transmission, and that quantitatively matches a number
6:145:9593:20:20:100:417:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of important features of the data, including wealth inequality.
6:146:9656:20:20:117:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our findings are based on a life-cycle model with perfect altruism across
6:147:9729:20:21:100:497:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:generations and period-by-period occupational choice. Some households have
6:148:9803:21:20:100:496:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the ability to employ capital and labor more productively than others, and po-

6:150:9960:20:20:100:241:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are imperfectly enforceable.
6:151:9988:20:21:117:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This framework builds on Cagetti and De Nardi [11] by allowingthe en-

7:155:10257:20:21:117:497:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Despite the relevance of estate taxation reforms and its big impact in the
7:156:10331:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:policy circles, few papers study it in the context of quantitative models capable

7:158:10486:20:20:100:496:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is because constructing such a model, computing it, and calibrating it to the

7:164:10899:20:21:100:497:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wealth observed in the data.  Neither of these papers, however, model en-

8:183:12135:33:20:100:496:590:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Among the most recent literature Gale, Hines, and Slemrod [17], Aaron and
8:184:12208:20:21:100:497:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gale [1], and Gale and Perozek [18] provide overviews and discussions on estate
8:185:12287:21:20:100:497:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and gift taxation. Here we only focus on the features of both statutory and
8:186:12362:20:21:100:453:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effective estate taxation that are most important given our purposes.
8:187:12431:21:20:117:497:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Federal law imposes an integrated set of taxes on estates, gifts, and gener-
8:188:12507:20:20:100:497:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ation skipping transfers. The gross estate includes all of the decedent’s assets.
8:189:12588:20:20:100:496:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the process of going from the gross estate to the net, taxable estate, there
8:190:12667:20:38:100:271:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are some of the important steps2:
8:191:12700:38:33:114:444:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1. The allowed estate tax implied exemption level was $675,000.
8:192:12763:33:20:114:497:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2. Assets are typically evaluated at fair market value. Closely held busi-

8:194:12906:20:20:129:496:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:value” rather than their highest alternative market-oriented value. The
8:195:12977:20:33:129:391:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximum allowed reduction in value was $770,000.
8:196:13025:33:21:114:497:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3. In addition, it is often possible to substantially discount assetvalue when
8:197:13103:21:20:129:497:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such assets are not readily marketable or the taxpayers’ ownership does
8:198:13174:20:33:129:263:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not correlate with control.
8:199:13201:33:20:114:497:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4. Interests in certain qualified family businesses were also allowed an extra
8:200:13279:20:20:129:497:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:deduction of up to $ 625,000 in 2000 for the value of the businessbeing

8:202:13362:27:16:113:496:143:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:2We focus on the characteristics of the 2000 tax code. See Johnson, Mikow, and Britton
8:203:13448:16:0:100:457:127:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Heller [8], and Brownlee [10] for a historic perspective on Federal Estatetaxation.
9:204:13532:0:38:114:496:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:5. One can apply unlimited deductions for transfers to a surviving spouse.
9:205:13606:38:20:117:497:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:After determining the net estate, that is, the gross estate appropriately
9:206:13679:20:21:100:496:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:valued less deductions, the statutory tax rate is applied. The “applicable credit
9:207:13760:21:20:100:497:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:amount” implied that in 2000 at least the first $675,000 were nottaxable. The
9:208:13837:20:20:100:497:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marginal federal tax rate for a taxable returns above that amount was starting
9:209:13915:20:21:100:262:535:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at 37% and topping out at 55%
9:210:13944:21:20:117:497:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Credit is given for state inheritance and estate taxes. Most states now levy
9:211:14020:20:20:100:497:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“soak-up taxes” that only shift revenues from the federal to thestate treasuries
9:212:14100:20:21:100:374:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:without adding to the total tax burden on the estate.
9:213:14153:21:21:117:497:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Just by looking at the simple scheme above, once can see that a richcouple
9:214:14227:21:20:100:496:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:could immediately double the standard exemption level just byleaving the
9:215:14299:20:20:100:497:412:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:children assets up to the deduction upon the death of the first decedent, and
9:216:14376:20:21:100:486:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then applying the deduction a second time upon death of the other spouse.
9:217:14449:21:20:117:496:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Judicious application of valuation schemes and extra deduction for the

9:219:14596:20:21:100:496:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:down the effective estate tax rate above the exemption level. Schmalbeck [40]
9:220:14673:21:20:100:497:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:describes many (legal) estate taxes avoidance schemes to reduce the estate tax
9:221:14751:20:20:100:497:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:burden and provides some measures of effective estate taxes after such schemes
9:222:14829:20:21:100:188:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are implemented.
9:223:14845:21:20:117:497:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gale and Slemrod [19] argue that simply by using legal valuation tech-
9:224:14915:20:20:100:497:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:niques, exemptions, and various deductions, a couple with a $4 million dollar
9:225:14992:20:21:100:497:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:business could pass it to their heir without paying any estate taxes, and without
9:226:15073:21:20:100:496:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:having to engage in any complicated tax avoidance scheme. They also argue
9:227:15146:20:21:100:486:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that this threshold can be increased even further using other legal schemes.
9:228:15222:21:20:117:496:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Britton Eller, Erard, and Ho [33] focus on tax noncompliance by using
9:229:15291:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:audit data. They find that overall (illegal) estate tax evasionto be about 13%
10:230:15370:0:21:100:229:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the potential tax base.
10:231:15396:21:20:117:497:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Aaron and Munnell [2] and Kopczuk et al. [28] also argue that there are
10:232:15467:20:20:100:337:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:many ways to reduce effective estate taxation.
10:233:15513:20:21:117:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Although many experts agree that effective estate taxation canbe sub-
10:234:15582:21:20:100:497:572:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stantially reduced by appropriate estate management and valuation (this can
10:235:15657:20:20:100:497:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be done, in part, even after the death of the decedent), thereis considerable
10:236:15734:20:20:100:496:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uncertainty about how much people can and do reduce the estatetax burden
10:237:15806:20:20:100:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by using both legal and illegal ways. Wolff [46] and Poterba [35]study this by
10:238:15884:20:21:100:497:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:comparing tax revenues and the distribution of estates reported in tax forms
10:239:15960:21:20:100:496:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the hypothetical one that would be implied by the Surveyof Consumer Fi-
10:240:16036:20:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nances using mortality probabilities and many other assumptions. While Wolf
10:241:16111:20:20:100:497:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:argues that the estate tax captures only about 25% of the potential tax base,
10:242:16188:20:21:100:497:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Poterba concludes that it catches most of it. Similarly, there is uncertainty
10:243:16265:21:20:100:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about the effective progressivity of the estate tax and on its exact exemption
10:244:16343:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:level. Some argue that it is easier to decrease the tax burden for smaller es-
10:245:16421:20:20:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tates (which are also less likely to be audited). Others argue that given the
10:246:16498:20:20:100:496:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:economies of scale for tax avoidance and evasion the tax burdenmight actually
10:247:16575:20:21:100:235:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be lower for larger estates.
10:248:16603:21:20:117:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is, in contrast, no dispute about the observed revenues from the
10:249:16673:20:20:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate and gift tax, and about the fraction of estates that do pay estate taxes.
10:250:16753:20:21:100:496:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In terms of revenue, only about 2% of the estates of adult decedents do pay any
10:251:16832:21:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate taxes, and their revenue is about 0.3% of US output (See for example
10:252:16907:20:20:100:222:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gale and Slemrod [19]).
10:253:16930:20:20:117:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the process of calibrating our model we propose a complementary and
10:254:17000:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:novel way to assess the burden of estate taxation. We assume a simple form
10:255:17074:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for estate taxation that allows for an exemption level and a constant tax rate
10:256:17152:20:0:100:496:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:above such exemption level, and we use our model generated datato match the
11:257:17228:0:20:100:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction of estates paying estate taxes, and estate tax revenuesas a fraction
11:258:17305:20:21:100:496:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of output.  Interestingly, we find numbers that fall well within the bounds
11:259:17380:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:proposed by the previous literature.  Given that our model matches asset
11:260:17452:20:20:100:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:holdings so well both for entrepreneurs and workers, and giventhe considerable
11:261:17530:20:20:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:uncertainty about effective estate tax avoidance and evasion,we see this as a
11:262:17607:20:21:100:214:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:useful way to proceed.
11:263:17629:21:21:117:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Legislation passed in 2003 has statutory marginal tax rates gradually de-
11:264:17702:21:20:100:497:511:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:crease each year, and statutory exemption levels to graduallyincrease every
11:265:17777:20:20:100:497:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:year until 2010. In 2010, all estates are be taxed at 0%. In 2011, however, these
11:266:17858:20:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:temporary cuts are scheduled to vanish, and the statutory taxation schedule
11:267:17933:20:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is to revert to much higher levels.  Many interpret this path ascompelling
11:268:18007:20:53:100:270:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence that a reform is needed.

11:271:18125:20:20:100:497:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sponding to a given policy experiment, we make time subscripts explicit when-

11:274:18233:30:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We adopt a life-cycle model with intergenerational altruism.  To make the
11:275:18306:20:20:100:496:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results quantitatively interesting, we need short time periods. To make the
11:276:18381:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model computationally manageable, we have to keep the number of stages
11:277:18451:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of life small. To reconcile these two necessities, we adopt a modeling device
11:278:18528:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:introduced by Blanchard [9] and generalized by Gertler [21]to a life-cycle
11:279:18602:20:0:100:138:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:setting.
12:280:18612:0:20:117:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our model period is one year long. Households go through two stages of
12:281:18682:20:21:100:497:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:life, young and old age. A young person faces a constant probability of aging
12:282:18759:21:20:100:496:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:during each period (1−πy), and an old person faces a constant probability
12:283:18832:20:20:100:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of dying during each period (1−πo). When an old person dies, his offspring
12:284:18906:20:21:100:465:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:enters the model, carrying the assets bequeathed to him by the parent.
12:285:18976:21:20:117:502:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Appropriately parameterized, this framework generates households for which
12:286:19050:20:20:100:496:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the average length of the working period and the retirement period is realistic.
12:287:19130:20:43:100:354:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is a continuum of households of measure 1.

12:295:19376:28:21:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Each person possesses two types of ability, which we take to be exogenous,
12:296:19450:21:20:100:497:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stochastic, positively correlated over time, and uncorrelated with each other.
12:297:19528:20:20:100:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Entrepreneurial ability (θt) is the capacity to invest capital and labor more or
12:298:19608:20:20:100:496:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:less productively using one’s own production function. Working ability (yt) is
12:299:19686:20:21:100:442:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the capacity to produce income out of labor by working for others.
12:300:19752:21:20:117:496:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The entrepreneurs can borrow, invest capital, hire labor, and run a tech-
12:301:19825:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nology whose return depends on their own entrepreneurial ability: those with
12:302:19901:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher ability levels have higher average and marginal returns from capital
12:303:19976:20:21:100:496:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and labor. When the entrepreneur investsktproduction net of depreciation is
12:304:20051:21:20:100:143:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given by
12:305:20059:20:0:194:402:127:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:f(kt, nt) =θ(kγt(1 +nt)(1−γ))ν+ (1−δ)k

13:307:20170:20:21:100:497:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:entrepreneur to 1. Entrepreneurs thus face decreasing returns from investment,
13:308:20248:21:20:100:496:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as their managerial skills become gradually stretched over larger and larger
13:309:20324:20:20:100:496:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:projects (as in Lucas (1978)).  While entrepreneurial ability is exogenously
13:310:20400:20:20:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given, the entrepreneurial rate of return from investing in capital is endogenous
13:311:20481:20:21:100:494:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and is a function of the size of the project that the entrepreneur implements.
13:312:20559:21:20:117:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is no within-period uncertainty regarding the returns of the en-
13:313:20629:20:20:100:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trepreneurial project.  The abilityθtis observable and known by all at the
13:314:20703:20:21:100:497:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:beginning of the period.  We therefore abstract from problemsarising from
13:315:20776:21:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:partial observability, costly state verification, and from diversification of en-
13:316:20857:20:20:100:191:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trepreneurial risk.
13:317:20876:20:21:117:487:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Workers can save (but not borrow) at a riskless, constant rate of return.
13:318:20949:21:20:117:497:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Many firms are not controlled by a single entrepreneur and are not likely
13:319:21022:20:20:100:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to face the same financing restrictions that we stress in our model. There-
13:320:21097:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fore, as in Quadrini (2000), we model two sectors of production: one popu-
13:321:21171:20:21:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lated by the entrepreneurs and one by “non-entrepreneurial” firms. The non-
13:322:21246:21:20:100:496:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:entrepreneurial sector is represented by a standard Cobb-Douglas production
13:323:21321:20:20:100:145:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function:
13:324:21330:20:29:227:497:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:F(Kct, Lct) =A(Kct)α(Lct)1−α(1)

13:328:21544:28:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in Marcet and Marimon [32], Kehoe and Levine [26], Albuquerque and
13:329:21613:21:20:100:516:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Hopenhayn[3], Cooley, Marimon, and Quadrini [15], and Cagetti and De Nardi [11],
13:330:21693:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the borrowing constraints are endogenously determined in equilibrium and
14:331:21767:0:21:100:459:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stem from the assumptions that contracts are imperfectly enforceable.
14:332:21836:21:20:117:497:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Imperfect enforceability of contracts means that the creditors will not be
14:333:21910:20:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:able to force the debtors to fully repay their debts as promised, but that the
14:334:21988:20:20:100:496:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:debtors fully repay only if it is in their own interest to do so.  Since both
14:335:22065:20:21:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:parties are aware of this feature and act rationally, the lender will lend to a
14:336:22144:21:20:100:497:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given borrower an amount (possibly zero) that will be in the debtor’s interest
14:337:22222:20:20:100:210:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to repay as promised.
14:338:22243:20:20:117:496:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In particular, we assume that the entrepreneurs who borrow either can
14:339:22312:20:21:100:497:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:invest the money and repay their debt at the end of the period orcan run
14:340:22384:21:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:away without investing it and be workers for one period. In thelatter case,
14:341:22459:20:20:100:496:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:they retain a fractionfof their working capitalkt(which includes own assets
14:342:22534:20:20:100:496:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and borrowed money) and their creditors seize the rest.  We assumethat
14:343:22604:20:21:100:497:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:labor services are paid at the end of the period, hence entrepreneurs are not
14:344:22681:21:20:100:352:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contrained in the amount of labor that they hire.
14:345:22730:20:20:117:496:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In the absence of market imperfections, the optimal level of capital is
14:346:22801:20:20:100:496:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only related to technological parameters and does not depend on initial as-
14:347:22876:20:21:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sets. In our framework, instead, the higher the amount of the entrepreneur’s
14:348:22952:21:20:100:496:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:own wealth invested in the business, the larger the amount that the borrower
14:349:23028:20:20:100:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would lose in case of default. Hence, the lower the incentive to default, and the
14:350:23109:20:20:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:larger the sum that the creditor is willing to lend to the entrepreneur. Hence,
14:351:23188:20:21:100:496:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the entrepreneur’s assets act as collateral, but the loan is not necessarily fully
14:352:23270:21:20:100:170:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:collateralized.
14:353:23285:20:20:117:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As a result, not all potentially profitable projects receive appropriate fund-
14:354:23363:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing. Households with little wealth can borrow little, even if they have high
14:355:23439:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ability as entrepreneurs. Since the entrepreneur forgoes his potential earnings
14:356:23518:21:20:100:496:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as a worker, he will choose to become an entrepreneur only if the size of the
14:357:23595:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm that he can start is big enough, that is, if he is rich enough to be able to
15:358:23678:0:45:100:399:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:borrow and invest a suitable amount of money in his firm.

21:507:30814:29:21:100:497:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our economy starts from an initial steady state in which there isestate tax-
21:508:30890:21:20:100:497:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ation. Unexpectedly, the government abolishes estate taxes and makes up for
21:509:30965:20:20:100:497:584:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the shortfall of government revenues by changing one of the following three
21:510:31040:20:33:100:164:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instruments:
21:511:31052:33:33:114:241:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1. government spending,
21:512:31075:33:33:114:238:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2. the consumption tax,
21:513:31098:33:33:114:379:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3. the proportional part of the tax on total income.
21:514:31150:33:21:117:497:432:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:When we use either the income or the consumption tax, we allow the
21:515:31216:21:20:100:496:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:government to adjust this policy instrument for ten years, and after this period
21:516:31296:20:20:100:497:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the tax is set at its final steady state level. The level of the tax during these
21:517:31377:20:20:100:497:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years is determined by the requirement that the government budget constraint
21:518:31453:20:20:100:497:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:has to be satisfied in present value. The shape of the tax change over this time
21:519:31533:20:21:100:497:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:period is constrained to be piecewise linear over two five-years subperiods.
21:520:31609:21:20:100:497:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:That is, during these ten years the government could, for example, raise the
21:521:31685:20:20:100:497:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:chosen tax instrument for five years, and then lower it down to itsfinal steady
21:522:31764:20:20:100:497:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:state value for other five years. In these experiments government expenditure
21:523:31841:20:21:100:497:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is kept fixed as a fraction of total output both during the transition and in the
21:524:31922:21:20:100:191:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:final steady state.
21:525:31941:20:21:117:497:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:For all final steady states we set government debt to be the same constant
21:526:32015:21:20:100:370:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction of total output as in the initial steady state.
21:527:32071:20:21:117:496:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:When we change government spending as a result of the abolitionof the
21:528:32140:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate tax, we keep all other tax rates fixed at their initial steady state value,
21:529:32222:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and we take government debt to be a constant fraction of outputalso during
22:530:32298:0:20:100:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the transition path. Budget balance for the government then implies how much
22:531:32374:20:21:100:239:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:government expenditure is.
22:532:32400:21:20:117:496:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As soon as people learn about the new policy, the households reoptimize

22:534:32547:20:20:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Barring any other changes, the economy will eventually settledown on a final
22:535:32623:20:21:100:497:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:steady state as a result of the new tax code (the final steady state).During
22:536:32699:21:20:100:397:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the intervening years, the economy will be in a transition.
22:537:32758:20:20:117:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The transition will take longer than the period over which taxes change
22:538:32829:20:20:100:496:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:because the distribution of people over state variables will take a while to
22:539:32905:20:21:100:497:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reach its steady state level, and because of general equilibrium effects (the
22:540:32982:21:49:100:425:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices will take a while to get close to their steady state levels).

22:545:33291:20:20:100:496:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:so that the data generated by the initial steady state of the model matches
22:546:33366:20:20:100:345:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:some relevant counterpart of the observed data.
22:547:33413:20:21:117:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Regarding the first set of parameters, we take the coefficient of relative
22:548:33487:21:20:100:497:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk aversion to be 1.5, a value close to those estimated, among others, by
22:549:33562:20:20:100:496:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Attanasio et al. [6]. As is standard in the business cycle literature, we choose
22:550:33642:20:20:100:496:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a depreciation rateδof 6% and the capital share in the non-entrepreneurial

22:552:33790:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the average length of the working life is 45 years and theaverage length
22:553:33867:21:20:100:496:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the retirement period is 11 years. This implies that the fraction of young
22:554:33944:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:people in the population is about 80%. The logarithm of the incomeyprocess

23:556:34096:20:21:100:496:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be .95, as estimated, for instance, by Storesletten et al. [44].The variance is
23:557:34175:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:chosen to match the Gini coefficient for earnings of .38, the average found in
23:558:34253:20:20:100:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the PSID. We assume that the income process and the entrepreneurial ability
23:559:34328:20:20:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:processes evolve independently; the exact values for the income and ability
23:560:34403:20:21:100:496:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:processes are described in Appendix A. The social security replacement rate
23:561:34478:21:20:100:395:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is 40% of average gross income. (see Kotlikoff et al. [29].)

23:566:34813:20:20:100:446:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accounts has been quite stable around 11%-12% from 1989 to 1999.
23:567:34877:20:21:117:496:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We pick the level of government debt (as a fraction of output)so that,

26:649:38400:21:20:100:497:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:match the empirical observation that 40% of entrepreneurs hire no labor on

29:718:41408:0:20:100:496:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as follows: workers that remain workers, workers that become entrepreneurs,
29:719:41483:20:21:100:497:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:entrepreneurs that remain entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs that switch to be-
29:720:41560:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing workers. For each of these subcategories we compute wealth mobility across

29:722:41657:20:21:117:496:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 4 reports both the results and the number of observationscorre-
29:723:41726:21:20:100:496:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sponding to each cell.  We can see that in our sample the total number of
29:724:41799:20:20:100:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:workers that remain workers is 2214, the total number of workers that switch
29:725:41875:20:20:100:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to being entrepreneurs is 75, the total number of entrepreneurs that switch to
29:726:41953:20:20:100:496:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:being workers is 49, and the number of entrepreneurs that stayentrepreneurs
29:727:42028:20:21:100:497:472:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is 206. These numbers are important because they highlight howsome of the
29:728:42101:21:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transition matrices are based on a small number of observations and should
29:729:42175:20:20:100:265:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:therefore be taken with caution.
29:730:42207:20:21:117:497:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This said, the transition matrices indicate more wealth upward mobility
29:731:42278:21:20:100:496:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for the entrepreneurs that stay entrepreneurs than for the workers that stay
29:732:42354:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:workers. Although the mobility matrices off the main diagonal (workers to en-
29:733:42431:20:20:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trepreneurs and entrepreneurs to workers) are based on a very small a sample
29:734:42507:20:20:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:size, they seem to broadly indicate that the workers that become entrepreneurs
29:735:42585:20:21:100:496:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are more upwardly mobile than those that remain workers, and that the en-
29:736:42658:21:20:100:497:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trepreneurs that switch to being workers are more downward mobile than those
29:737:42734:20:20:100:237:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that remain entrepreneurs.
29:738:42760:20:21:117:497:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We compute the analogous occupation and wealth mobility transition ma-
29:739:42830:21:20:100:496:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trix generated by our model (also over a five year period). The results are in
29:740:42908:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:table 5. The transition matrices estimated using our model include all of the
29:741:42985:20:20:100:422:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:population, and therefore do not have a small sample problem.
29:742:43046:20:21:117:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 5 shows that our model matches extremely well the wealthtransitions

29:744:43196:20:0:100:496:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and that also matches quite well the important patterns of thePSID data that

33:837:47715:25:28:137:246:337:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:ment purchases
33:838:47729:28:20:100:497:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Government purchases are unproductive in this framework.  Itis therefore
33:839:47801:20:20:100:496:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unsurprising that in the model economy (see Table 7, line 2) cutting the estate
33:840:47880:20:21:100:496:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tax at the expense of government purchases raises total output (by 1.3%)
33:841:47952:21:20:100:496:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and capital (by 2.4%).  The interesting finding here is that this effects are
33:842:48029:20:20:100:493:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:substantial when compared to the small revenue coming from the estate tax.
33:843:48103:20:20:117:496:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The elimination of the estate tax increases output by a factor of four times
33:844:48179:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the revenue raised by the estate tax, and raises capital by at least a factor
33:845:48256:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of eight. Abolishing estate taxation benefits the newborn entrepreneurs, who

33:847:48407:20:0:100:497:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as a result. More funds in the economy are thus invested in the more produc-

34:861:48927:20:20:100:497:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:amplified by the reduction in the interest rate, which represents the opportu-
34:862:49005:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:nity cost of funds for the entrepreneurs. This price change benefits all of the

34:867:49323:20:20:100:497:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tate tax, and the government has to cut government purchases as a fraction
34:868:49397:20:21:100:497:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of output as a result. However, while the revenue from estate taxes in initial
34:869:49475:21:20:100:496:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:steady state is 0.3% of output, the government has to cut spending only by
34:870:49549:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:0.05% as a fraction of output (with respect to the initial steady state) because
34:871:49629:20:20:100:496:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the increase in output (and thus tax revenues) generated by the abolition

35:888:50287:20:20:100:497:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:total capital increases for about 50 years.  Aggregate output follows a very
35:889:50363:20:21:100:165:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:similar path.

35:895:50704:20:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:consumption compensation lines, shows that almost 80% of the young and
35:896:50774:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over 90% of the old benefit from this reform. The young make up for 80% of
35:897:50848:20:20:100:178:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the population.
35:898:50863:20:21:117:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Who gains from this reform? The largest gains are experiencedby the old,
35:899:50935:21:20:100:496:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and especially by the rich among them, but people in the lower-middle class
35:900:51010:20:0:100:455:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(defined as having net worth below half a million dollar) also benefit.
36:901:51083:0:20:117:497:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Those that are very rich, and especially the old among them, benefit from
36:902:51156:20:21:100:497:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the break in estate taxation. The immensely rich old experience a consumption
36:903:51233:21:20:100:497:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gain of 7%, while the gain of their young counterparts is less than 1%. This
36:904:51309:20:20:100:497:593:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is because the old are much closer to the time of their demise, andthus value
36:905:51386:20:20:100:496:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the estate tax break more. (The scales at the left of each of the two graphs
36:906:51462:20:21:100:308:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:refer to the consumption compensation.)
36:907:51501:21:20:117:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Those whose net worth is below half a million dollars gain because of the
36:908:51574:20:21:100:497:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increase in wages resulting from more aggregate capital accumulation.  For
36:909:51648:21:20:100:381:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:them, wage income makes up for most of total income.
36:910:51700:20:21:117:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The losers are the young that are not poor enough and not rich enough:
36:911:51770:21:20:100:496:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:those whose net worth is above half a million dollar, but below ten or twenty
36:912:51847:20:20:100:497:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(depending on their entrepreneurial ability level). This is because capital in-
36:913:51926:20:20:100:496:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:come makes up for a large share of their total income, and the interest rate
36:914:52002:20:21:100:262:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:drops as a result of this reform.
36:915:52035:21:20:117:496:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Similarly, the old with low entrepreneurial ability and assets above 1 million
36:916:52113:20:20:100:497:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dollar, but below 7 million dollar, are hurt by the decrease inthe interest rate.
36:917:52194:20:21:100:497:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:They also do not benefit from the estate tax break, given that they were below
36:918:52272:21:20:100:427:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the exemption level, or close to it, before the reform took place.
36:919:52338:20:21:117:497:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The average welfare gain from this reform is of the order of 0.2% of yearly

39:1087:56810:21:20:100:496:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reform in a model with no entrepreneurial choice, in which the key force driving
39:1088:56890:20:20:100:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wealth inequality is that the rich are subject to very large idiosyncratic earnings

39:1090:57048:20:20:100:496:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:our model, they find that the abolition of the estate tax generates only a
39:1091:57122:20:21:100:496:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:small increase in wealth inequality. Compared to us, they obtain a long-run

40:1098:57653:20:41:100:497:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:results in much lower aggregate income than smaller investmentby the workers.
40:1099:57730:41:20:117:497:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Laitner [30] also studies the effects of a similar reform. He adopts a more
40:1100:57805:20:20:100:496:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stylized economy in which some household are altruistic while others do not
40:1101:57880:20:21:100:497:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:care about their descendants.  His main message is that, in his framework,
40:1102:57954:21:20:100:497:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:abolishing the estate tax generates a significant increase in theshare of total
40:1103:58033:20:20:100:497:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:net worth held by the richest 1%, while the effects on the aggregates are
40:1104:58106:20:20:100:497:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relatively small for most parameterizations, but can be positive or negative
40:1105:58182:20:41:100:357:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:depending on the fraction of altruistic households.
40:1106:58233:41:20:117:496:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In our framework the consumption compensations required by this reform
40:1107:58303:20:20:100:497:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are similar to the ones that we reported when the consumption tax is raised.
40:1108:58379:20:21:100:497:330:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in that policy, increasing the income tax to make up from lost revenues
40:1109:58453:21:20:100:497:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from the estate tax implies small welfare losses for most of the population.
40:1110:58529:20:20:100:496:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The average welfare cost for this reform is of the same order of magnitude
40:1111:58603:20:41:100:313:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than when the consumption tax is raised.
40:1112:58643:41:20:117:497:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In sum, we find that eliminating the estate tax while increasing the tax on
40:1113:58718:20:20:100:497:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:total income would generate a small increase on aggregate capital but would
40:1114:58793:20:20:100:497:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:have negligible effects on aggregate output. This reform would slightly increase
40:1115:58873:20:21:100:497:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wealth inequality, and would redistribute from the young to the old and from
40:1116:58949:21:20:100:497:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:most people to a tiny fraction of rich people, thus generatingwelfare losses for
40:1117:59029:20:0:100:241:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the most of the population.
41:1118:59058:0:32:100:229:654:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:7  Conclusions
41:1119:59072:32:21:100:496:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our model suggests that eliminating the estate tax would not generate large
41:1120:59147:21:20:100:497:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increases in wealth and consumption inequality, and increasesin aggregate
41:1121:59220:20:20:100:271:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:output and capital accumulation.
41:1122:59252:20:20:117:496:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Unfortunately, these reforms would also imply welfare losses to the vast
41:1123:59324:20:20:100:497:541:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:majority of the population, and benefit only the very rich and, in particular,
41:1124:59402:20:21:100:246:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the old among the very rich.
41:1125:59430:21:20:117:496:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This happens despite the fact that our framework models explicitly en-
41:1126:59500:20:20:100:497:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trepreneurial activity and borrowing constraints, which seemto be the key
41:1127:59573:20:20:100:497:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:features that the proponent of abolishing estate taxation aremost concerned
41:1128:59648:20:21:100:133:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about.
41:1129:59654:21:20:117:496:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There are features of reality that could provide additionalreasons to abolish
41:1130:59731:20:20:100:496:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estate taxation. For example, our model does not consider tax avoidance costs.
41:1131:59809:20:20:100:497:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Significant amounts of resources might be spent to decrease the tax burden,
41:1132:59884:20:20:100:496:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through the use of lawyers and accountants. The cost of tax avoidance might
41:1133:59959:20:21:100:496:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:generate a deadweight loss that should be considered in the overall evaluation
41:1134:60037:21:20:100:496:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of any change in the estate tax. (See Aaron and Munnell [2] and Schmalbeck

41:1136:60186:20:0:100:421:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:large extent unexplored issue that we leave for future research.

47:1319:69245:21:22:100:497:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:were to assume a somewhat smaller or larger cutoff for the amount ofbusiness
47:1320:69321:22:22:100:278:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:income received during the period.
47:1321:69355:22:21:117:497:545:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We perform the estimation on three samples:  the whole population of
47:1322:69423:21:22:100:497:524:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:households, including workers and entrepreneurs, the subpopulation of workers
47:1323:69500:22:22:100:496:502:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only, and the subpopulation of entrepreneurs only. The estimated values for
47:1324:69575:22:0:100:421:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the three groups are shown in Table 9 and plotted in Figure 1.
