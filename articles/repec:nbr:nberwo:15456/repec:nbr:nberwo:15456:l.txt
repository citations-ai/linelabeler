2:42:2615:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Based on managed care models of health insurance in wealthy countries, Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado
2:43:2715:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:is a publicly financed insurance program targeted to the poor, aiming both to provide risk protection
2:44:2816:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and to promote allocative efficiency in the use of medical care. Using a “fuzzy” regression discontinuity
2:45:2921:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:design, we find that the program has shielded the poor from some financial risk while increasing the

3:69:3527:0:27:72:152:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:70:3543:27:28:108:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:In developing countries, the inability to smooth consumption directly reduces welfare and 
3:71:3633:28:27:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:leads to informal risk management strategies that stifle productive activity (Paxson 1993, 
3:72:3724:27:28:72:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Townsend 1994, Morduch 1995).  Because unexpected illness is a leading source of economic 
3:73:3814:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk, the expansion of health insurance is therefore a public policy priority in many parts of the 
3:74:3913:28:27:72:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing world (Gertler and Gruber 2002, GTZ, WHO, and ILO 2005, WHO 2010, Mohanan 
3:75:3998:27:28:72:503:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:2012).1  Such initiatives are often large, centrally-planned programs operated exclusively 
3:76:4089:28:27:72:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:through the public sector – and they focus primarily on reducing the out-of-pocket price of 
3:77:4181:27:28:72:142:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:medical care.2 
3:78:4195:28:28:107:500:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:An early exception is Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado (or “Subsidized Regime,” 
3:79:4272:28:27:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:henceforth “SR”).  Introduced in 1993, the SR is a pluralistic, publicly-financed health insurance 
3:80:4371:27:28:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:program targeted to the poor.3  Colombians meeting a proxy means-test (determined by the 
3:81:4460:28:27:72:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sistema de Identificación de Beneficiarios, or SISBEN) are fully-subsidized to purchase 
3:82:4548:27:28:72:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance from private, government-approved insurers.  In contrast to the classical ‘managed 
3:83:4641:28:27:72:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:competition’ model of insurance (Enthoven 1978a and 1978b), participating insurers must offer 
3:84:4735:27:28:72:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:standardized benefits packages and accept standardized premiums.  Insurers can, however, form 
3:85:4829:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictive medical care networks, deny reimbursement for services deemed ‘unnecessary,’ and 
3:86:4922:28:15:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:pay health care providers in ways that encourage higher quality and lower cost medical care 
3:87:5014:15:8:72:219:224:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
3:88:5063:8:16:72:518:216:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 For example, one study finds that 5% of Latin American households spend 40% or more of ‘non-subsistence’ 
3:89:5170:16:11:72:538:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:income on medical care each year (Xu et al. 2003).  As Gertler and Gruber (2002) note, there are two major costs of 
3:90:5286:11:12:72:518:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:illness: medical care costs and reduced labor income.  Health insurance (our focus) addresses the former, while 
3:91:5398:12:7:72:234:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:disability insurance addresses the latter.

3:96:5861:11:7:72:322:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:Meghan (2008); and Gruber, Hendren, and Townsend (2012). 
3:97:5918:7:16:72:525:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 According to Article 153 of Law 100 (authorizing the creation of the SR), one of the SR’s guiding principles is 
3:98:6031:16:12:71:502:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Proteccion Integral: “The System of Social Security in health will provide health care to the population in: 
3:99:6140:12:11:71:525:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:education, information, health promotion and prevention, diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitation in quantity and 
3:100:6254:11:0:71:284:74:100:Times:144:Times:B:quality according to the Plan Obligatorio de Salud.” 
4:101:6308:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(through capitated payment contracts, for example – fixed payments per enrollee per month).  
4:102:6401:27:28:72:499:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Overall, Colombia’s SR shares features of managed care models of health insurance that 
4:103:6488:28:27:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasize cost-containment and allocative efficiency traditionally found only in wealthy 
4:104:6577:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries.  It therefore represents important early experience in a markedly different institutional 
4:105:6678:28:28:72:139:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:environment. 
4:106:6691:28:27:108:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:This paper studies the impact of the SR on financial risk protection, service use, and 
4:107:6778:27:28:72:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:health outcomes among Colombia’s poor.  Program eligibility is supposed to be determined 
4:108:6867:28:27:72:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:according to a discrete threshold in the continuous SISBEN index, so in principle we could use a 
4:109:6964:27:28:72:525:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression discontinuity design to do so.  Because SISBEN scores are manipulated in practice 
4:110:7057:28:28:72:526:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(BDO and CCRP 2000, DNP 2001, 2003a, and 2003b, Fresneda 2003, Camacho and Conover 
4:111:7140:28:27:72:525:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:2011), we instead use underlying index components collected through independent household 
4:112:7230:27:28:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:surveys to generate our own (un-manipulated) SISBEN score calculations.  We then instrument 
4:113:7322:28:27:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:for SR enrollment with our re-constructed eligibility measure (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw 
4:114:7416:27:28:71:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:2001).  In general, our estimates are robust across a variety of parametric and non-parametric 
4:115:7511:28:27:72:144:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:specifications. 
4:116:7527:27:28:108:496:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Despite our strategy for addressing manipulation of eligibility, our approach has 
4:117:7609:28:28:72:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:limitations.  First, because we use household surveys to implement a “fuzzy” regression 
4:118:7697:28:27:72:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:discontinuity design, our samples are relatively small.  Second, we measure SISBEN index 
4:119:7786:27:28:72:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:components after official SISBEN classification occurred, presumably resulting in a degree of 
4:120:7880:28:27:71:542:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:measurement error.  Third, due to financial shortfalls, many of Colombia’s municipios (hereafter, 
4:121:7978:27:28:72:502:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:“counties”) used eligibility thresholds that fell short of the official one.  Following Chay, 
4:122:8072:28:0:72:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:McEwan, and Urquiola (2005), we therefore estimate and use county-specific thresholds.  These 
5:123:8168:0:27:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:limitations introduce noise into the regression discontinuity design and generally bias us against 
5:124:8267:27:28:72:270:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:finding behavioral responses to the SR.   
5:125:8309:28:27:108:506:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:We first find evidence that by the mid-2000s, the SR succeeded in protecting poor 
5:126:8391:27:28:72:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Colombians from financial risk associated with the medical costs of unexpected illness.  In 
5:127:8483:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular, SR enrollment appears to have reduced the variability of out-of-pocket spending for 
5:128:8579:28:27:72:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:inpatient care.  Despite this reduction in risk, however, we observe little evidence of meaningful 
5:129:8678:27:28:72:493:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:portfolio choice effects (changes in the composition of household assets, human capital 
5:130:8766:28:27:72:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments, or household consumption), perhaps because the SR falls short of providing full 
5:131:8859:27:28:72:124:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance. 
5:132:8870:28:28:108:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our results also suggest that SR enrollment is associated with large increases in the use of 
5:133:8963:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:traditionally under-utilized preventive services – some of which nearly doubled.  Moreover, we 
5:134:9058:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:find evidence of health improvement under the SR as well – specifically, gains along margins 
5:135:9151:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:sensitive to the increases in preventive care that we observe.  There is more mixed evidence of 
5:136:9247:27:28:72:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in the use of curative services (although theoretical predictions about the use of curative 
5:137:9347:28:27:72:181:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:care are ambiguous).   
5:138:9370:27:28:108:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:We conclude by discussing the underlying behavioral mechanisms that may explain our 
5:139:9454:28:28:72:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:results.  Because the SR is complex and multi-faceted, it is important to note that we cannot draw 
5:140:9553:28:27:71:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm inferences about them; we emphasize this as an important direction for future research.  
5:141:9647:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Overall, we highlight two mechanisms that we suspect are important: high-powered supply-side 
5:142:9740:28:27:72:508:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives and the possibility that enrollees receive care from higher-quality private sector 
5:143:9834:27:28:71:118:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:facilities.

6:147:9881:27:28:72:439:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1 Public Sector Health Insurance for Colombia’s Poor Prior to the Reform 
6:148:9956:28:27:108:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Prior to the introduction of the SR in 1993, roughly 25% of Colombians (a subset of 
6:149:10040:27:28:72:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:those with formal sector jobs) had any form of explicit health insurance (Pinto 2008).  However, 
6:150:10137:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Colombians lacking formal insurance also had a degree of implicit insurance provided through 
6:151:10230:28:27:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:the public sector.  Specifically, they could receive medical care from public sector hospitals and 
6:152:10329:27:28:72:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:clinics for a fraction of the full cost of their services; out-of-pocket payments were generally 
6:153:10426:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:progressive and loosely based on socio-economic status.  Public sector facilities, in turn, covered 
6:154:10526:27:28:72:486:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:their losses with direct transfers from national and local governments, and health care 
6:155:10614:28:28:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:professionals were typically paid fixed salaries that did not reward productivity.  Thus, poor 
6:156:10709:28:27:72:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Colombians effectively had a degree of implicit health insurance coupled with inefficient 
6:157:10799:27:28:72:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:provider incentives – and the reform that we study aimed to expand coverage while improving 
6:158:10891:28:27:72:126:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficiency. 
6:159:10903:27:28:72:453:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.2 Overview of Colombia’s Subsidized Health Insurance Regime for the Poor 
6:160:10978:28:27:108:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:Under Law 100 in 1993, Colombia introduced the SR, a novel form of publicly-financed 
6:161:11063:27:28:72:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:health insurance for the poor (Gwatkin et al. 2005, Escobar 2005).  Primarily through SR 
6:162:11152:28:28:72:490:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:expansion, formal health insurance coverage in Colombia grew from about 25% of the 
6:163:11235:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:population in 1993 to 80% in 2007 (CENDEX 2008).  The SR is organized as a variant of the 
6:164:11325:27:28:72:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:classical ‘managed competition’ model (Enthoven 1978a and 1978b).  Beneficiaries are fully 
6:165:11416:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsidized to purchase health insurance from competing health plans.  During our study period 
6:166:11510:27:28:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the mid-2000s), subsidies were financed by a combination of public resources including payroll 
6:167:11606:28:28:72:493:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:taxes and national and local general revenue.  These resources are transferred to county 
6:168:11695:28:0:72:499:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments, which in turn are responsible for eligibility determination, enrollment, and 
7:169:11787:0:27:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:contracting with health plans.  This role of local government has important implications for our 
7:170:11884:27:28:71:164:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:empirical analysis. 
7:171:11904:28:27:107:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Health plans charge county health authorities a government-regulated premium per 
7:172:11985:27:28:71:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollee and offer a standardized package of benefits (see Appendix 1 for the details of these 
7:173:12080:28:28:71:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits).4  Participating health plans then act as group purchasers of health services for their 
7:174:12178:28:27:72:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollees by contracting with a network of health facilities and clinicians.  Because premiums 
7:175:12273:27:28:72:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:and benefit packages are standardized by law (unlike the classical ‘managed competition’ 
7:176:12362:28:27:72:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:model), health plans compete for enrollees on the basis of provider networks and service quality.  
7:177:12461:27:28:71:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:In practice, however, very few cities had more than one insurer during the years that we study. 
7:178:12557:28:28:107:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Insurers’ ability to contract with health care providers (hospitals and medical groups) for 
7:179:12649:28:27:71:521:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:more efficient service provision is a central innovation of the SR.  Insurers receive premiums 
7:180:12744:27:28:71:491:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:(fixed payments per enrollee per unit time) for all covered services, giving them strong 
7:181:12833:28:27:71:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives to constrain total spending.  Insurers then (partially) transmit these incentives to 
7:182:12929:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:provider organizations through capitated payment contracts, and they have the authority to deny 
7:183:13025:28:27:71:308:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:reimbursement for services deemed inefficient.5  
7:184:13074:27:28:108:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:In the next section we describe the major demand- and supply-side incentive changes 
7:185:13158:28:28:72:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:under the SR, and Section 3 then provides predictions based on them for health service use, out-
7:186:13254:28:27:72:354:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:of-pocket spending on medical care, and health outcomes.

7:190:13360:8:16:72:514:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 During our study period, the benefits package of the SR (Plan Obligatorio de Salud Subsidiado) emphasized 
7:191:13468:16:11:72:535:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:coverage for primary and basic outpatient services, drugs, and some catastrophic care.  There was limited coverage 
7:192:13583:11:7:72:414:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:for specialist services, and there were substantial gaps in coverage for hospital care.   
7:193:13673:7:16:72:537:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 Provider organizations, in turn, must transmit the incentives they face to individual clinicians whom they employ.  
7:194:13791:16:12:72:533:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:Our interviews with stakeholders in the Colombian health care system suggest that organizations solve this agency 
7:195:13905:12:11:72:531:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:problem through non-financial rather than payment-based incentives (systematic data on organizational incentives 
7:196:14018:11:0:72:285:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:and clinician contracts is unfortunately unavailable). 
8:197:14075:0:27:72:395:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.3 Changes in Demand- and Supply-Side Incentives under the SR 
8:198:14138:27:28:108:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:There were important changes in both demand- and supply-side incentives with the 
8:199:14219:28:27:72:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:introduction of the SR.  On the demand-side, out-of-pocket prices for covered curative services 
8:200:14315:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:are 10% of the full price (as opposed to 30% for poor uninsured Colombians).6  Moreover, total 
8:201:14410:28:28:72:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:out-of-pocket spending per episode of illness each year is capped at half of the monthly 
8:202:14499:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum wage for SR beneficiaries – while the same cap is six times as large for uninsured 
8:203:14590:27:28:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients (Decreto 2357 and Acuerdo 260 of the Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Social en Salud).  
8:204:14685:28:27:72:451:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Notably, preventive services are essentially free regardless of insurance status. 
8:205:14767:27:28:108:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:On the supply-side, changes in provider payment contracts created substantially different 
8:206:14857:28:28:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for the provision of health services.  Specifically, there are two types of contracts 
8:207:14954:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:between insurers and provider organizations under the SR: capitated primary care contracts and 
8:208:15049:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:fee-for-service specialty care contracts.  For primary care, insurers pay providers fixed amounts 
8:209:15147:28:27:72:501:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:per month for all services used by enrollees (“capitation”).  These contracts create strong 
8:210:15239:27:28:72:493:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for providers to constrain total spending on primary care and have important 
8:211:15327:28:27:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:implications for both preventive and curative health care (as discussed in the next section).  
8:212:15422:27:28:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Importantly, promotion of preventive care can be a central means of reducing total expenditures.7 
8:213:15519:28:28:108:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:For specialty care, insurers generally pay providers a pre-determined fee for each covered 
8:214:15610:28:27:71:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:service that they supply (i.e., on a “fee-for-service” basis).  These contracts encourage the 
8:215:15704:27:57:72:540:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:provision of all reimbursable services (both efficient and inefficient).  However, SR insurers also 
8:216:15804:57:8:72:219:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
8:217:15853:8:16:72:526:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 The Colombian Ministry of Social Protection maintains a fee schedule (SOAT) regulating out-of-pocket prices.  
8:218:15965:16:11:71:503:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:For example, the full price for a physician consultation was 17,300 pesos in 2007 and 18,460 pesos in 2008 
8:219:16072:11:12:71:539:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:(approximately US $10).  Medical facility social workers assess uninsured patients’ “ability to pay” and may charge 
8:220:16188:12:7:71:462:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:them sliding scale out-of-pocket fees (greater than 10% of the full price) on a case-by-case basis. 
8:221:16288:7:16:72:535:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 Many medical professionals believe that increasing prevention reduces overall medical spending – whether or not 
8:222:16402:16:11:72:539:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:this is true depends on prices, the health production function, and competing risks.  Cohen, Neumann and Weinstein 
8:223:16517:11:0:72:353:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2008) find that 20% of preventive measure in the US are cost saving. 
9:224:16589:0:27:72:527:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:have the authority to deny reimbursement on a case-by-case basis for inefficient specialty care 
9:225:16685:27:28:72:433:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(termed “utilization review”), allowing them to limit wasteful service use.8 
9:226:16761:28:27:72:194:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.4 Eligibility for the SR 
9:227:16788:27:28:108:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Eligibility for the SR is determined using a poverty-targeting index called SISBEN (or 
9:228:16875:28:28:72:527:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sistema de Identificación de Beneficiarios).  The original SISBEN index consisted of fourteen 
9:229:16969:28:27:72:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:components measuring different aspects of household well-being (such as housing material, 
9:230:17059:27:28:72:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:access to public utilities, ownership of durable assets, demographic composition, educational 
9:231:17153:28:27:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:attainment, and labor force participation – for a complete description, see Appendix 2).9  On each 
9:232:17252:27:28:72:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:dimension, households are classified according to mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive 
9:233:17346:28:28:72:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:categories with varying weights assigned to each category; these weights vary between urban 
9:234:17438:28:27:72:510:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:and rural areas.  A household’s SISBEN score is then calculated by summing points across 
9:235:17527:27:28:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:components.  Possible scores range from 0 to 100 (with 0 being the most impoverished) and are 
9:236:17621:28:27:72:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:divided into six strata.  Households scoring in SISBEN strata 1 and 2 (the lowest strata) are 
9:237:17715:27:28:72:415:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligible for the SR (below 48 in urban areas, below 31 in rural areas).10 
9:238:17788:28:27:72:273:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.5 Eligibility and Enrollment in Practice 
9:239:17831:27:28:108:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although eligibility for the SR increases the likelihood of enrollment, neither one 
9:240:17915:28:78:72:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily implies the other for at least three reasons: misclassification or manipulation of 
9:241:18010:78:7:72:219:189:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
9:242:18059:7:12:72:407:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 Utilization review does little to promote services traditionally used sub-optimally. 
9:243:18146:12:16:72:519:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 Eligibility also varies within households because certain demographic groups (including pregnant women and 
9:244:18255:16:7:72:259:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:young children) are prioritized for enrollment. 
9:245:18303:7:16:72:529:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 SISBEN eligibility shifts abruptly at each county’s cabecera boundary, an administrative demarcation formally 
9:246:18416:16:11:71:501:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:distinguishing urban and rural parts of each county and loosely corresponding to the fringe of public utility 
9:247:18526:11:12:71:518:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:infrastructure.  Distinct urban and rural SISBEN scales are applied to households on corresponding sides of the 
9:248:18638:12:11:71:530:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:boundary, differing both in component parts and in the weighting of response categories for each component.  We 
9:249:18750:11:12:71:523:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:implemented a research design exploiting these urban/rural index differences, but inconsistent application of the 
9:250:18864:12:11:71:538:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:rural index and data limitations prevent us from drawing meaningful conclusions from it.  In this paper we therefore 
9:251:18981:11:0:71:177:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:focus on urban eligibility. 
10:252:19011:0:27:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:SISBEN scores, shortfalls in local government revenue, and enrollment that preceded SISBEN 
10:253:19102:27:28:72:146:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:enumeration.11 
10:254:19116:28:27:108:518:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:First, both local governments and households have incentives to manipulate SISBEN 
10:255:19198:27:28:72:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:scores.  Local governments receive fixed transfers from the national government for each 
10:256:19287:28:28:72:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:resident they enroll, creating incentives to maximize enrollment.  The selective enrollment of key 
10:257:19386:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:constituents can also provide political benefits (Camacho and Conover 2011).  Households prefer 
10:258:19482:27:28:72:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment over “uninsurance” as well because co-payments are lower for SR beneficiaries than 
10:259:19576:28:27:72:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:for those lacking formal insurance.  Consistent with both types of incentives, there is evidence of 
10:260:19676:27:28:72:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:considerable SISBEN score manipulation between 1997 and 2003 (Camacho and Conover 
10:261:19758:28:28:72:114:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:2011).12 
10:262:19766:28:27:108:530:432:144:Times:144:Times:?:Second, most local governments lack sufficient revenue to finance the enrollment of all 
10:263:19854:27:28:72:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligible residents.  According to law, those with lower SISBEN scores and those belonging to 
10:264:19947:28:27:72:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific targeted groups (such as children under five and pregnant women) are therefore 
10:265:20035:27:28:71:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:prioritized for enrollment.13  This means that many counties use de facto eligibility thresholds 
10:266:20132:28:27:72:296:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:that fall below the uniform national threshold. 
10:267:20180:27:28:108:535:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:Third, some counties began enrolling residents in the SR before all of their residents had 
10:268:20271:28:28:72:519:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:been classified using SISBEN.  These counties instead used other means-test criteria such as 
10:269:20364:28:27:72:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:residents’ estrato, a neighbourhood-level measure of socio-economic status used to establish 
10:270:20457:27:23:72:279:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:electricity prices paid by local households. 
10:271:20502:23:7:72:219:189:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
10:272:20551:7:12:72:361:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 Administrative mistakes in the enrollment process are also important. 
10:273:20624:12:16:72:531:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 Using results from the 2005 population census, the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reports that there are more 
10:274:20736:16:11:71:529:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:SR enrollees than residents in some counties (El Tiempo, October 26, 2006).  Camacho and Conover (2011) show 
10:275:20845:11:12:71:510:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:that the distribution of official SISBEN scores exhibits both large leftward shifts in density over time and the 
10:276:20958:12:11:71:528:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:formation of a mass point just to the left of the national eligibility threshold in urban areas.  Neither are present in 
10:277:21079:11:12:71:519:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:Colombian household surveys.  The former suggests misrepresentation by households, while the latter suggests 
10:278:21188:12:7:71:258:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:misrepresentation by enumerators or officials. 
10:279:21235:7:16:72:530:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 The laws formalizing this prioritization are Acuerdos 244 and 253 of the Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Social 
10:280:21348:16:11:71:498:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:en Salud.  This prioritization also means that although SISBEN scores are calculated at the level of family 
10:281:21456:11:0:71:531:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:“nucleus,” individuals within families can vary in enrollment status; we observe this in our household survey data. 
11:282:21574:0:27:108:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:In general, these realities of the program’s implementation have two broad implications 
11:283:21662:27:28:72:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:for our empirical analyses (which we discuss in greater detail in Section 4.2).  One is the 
11:284:21754:28:27:71:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessity of an empirical strategy that addresses manipulation of SISBEN scores.  The other is 
11:285:21849:27:28:71:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:that de facto county threshold must be estimated (because they are not officially reported).  
11:286:21943:28:28:71:172:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.6 Previous Studies 
11:287:21964:28:27:108:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:Several previous empirical papers have studied Colombia’s SR as well (see Giedion and 
11:288:22050:27:28:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Uribe (2009) for a comprehensive review).  Trujillo et al. (2005) use propensity score matching 
11:289:22146:28:27:72:537:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:to compare SR enrollees to observationally similar uninsured Colombians, finding that the SR is 
11:290:22242:27:28:72:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with greater medical care use.  Giedion et al. (2009) also use propensity score 
11:291:22333:28:28:72:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:matching and find that SR enrollment is associated with more visits to health care providers, 
11:292:22427:28:27:72:522:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher vaccination coverage rates, and fewer reports of not seeking medical care for financial 
11:293:22522:27:28:72:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:reasons.  Gaviria, Medina, and Mejía (2007) instrument for SR enrollment using length of time a 
11:294:22618:28:27:72:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:household head lived in his/her current place of residence and report that SR enrollment is 
11:295:22710:27:28:72:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with better self-reported health, more preventive and curative outpatient care, and 
11:296:22805:28:27:72:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:fewer hospitalizations.  Finally, matching official SISBEN score data with birth records, 
11:297:22895:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Camacho and Conover (2008) use a regression discontinuity design in two samples: a county 
11:298:22985:28:28:72:491:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:lacking clear evidence of manipulation and selected counties observed shortly after SR 
11:299:23072:28:27:72:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:implementation.  They find that SR enrollment is associated with increased birth weight and 
11:300:23164:27:28:72:541:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:better APGAR scores but not antenatal care use, medical supervision of deliveries, or probability 
11:301:23262:28:27:72:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:of hospital delivery.  Relative to previous studies of the SR, our paper employs a different 
11:302:23355:27:0:72:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:strategy for addressing manipulation of program eligibility, uses an approach that disentangles 
12:303:23454:0:27:72:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the role of the SR from other public programs using SISBEN, and studies a broader range of 
12:304:23545:27:28:72:280:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavioral responses to health insurance.14

12:306:23588:27:28:71:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:3. Empirical Predictions on the Interaction of Supply- and Demand-Side Incentives 
12:307:23670:28:28:107:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although we emphasize the centrality of changes in supply-side incentives under the SR, 
12:308:23758:28:27:72:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:out-of-pocket prices for covered services also fell.  This section therefore considers the joint 
12:309:23855:27:28:72:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of supply- and demand-side changes in formulating predictions about changes in risk 
12:310:23946:28:27:72:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:protection, the use of preventive and curative services, and health outcomes.  Section 5 then 
12:311:24040:27:28:72:253:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides empirical evidence on each. 
12:312:24077:28:28:108:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Risk Protection and Out-of-Pocket Medical Spending.  Protecting households against 
12:313:24160:28:27:72:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:medical care costs associated with unexpected illness is a central objective of health insurance.  
12:314:24259:27:28:72:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:As Appendix 1 shows, the SR covers many of the most expensive services including trauma 
12:315:24347:28:27:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:care, dialysis, and major joint replacement (hips and knees, for example).  It also caps total out-
12:316:24446:27:28:72:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:of-pocket spending per episode of illness each year at half of the monthly minimum wage. The 
12:317:24539:28:27:72:537:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:SR should therefore reduce the variability of out-of-pocket medical spending. Assuming that the 
12:318:24635:27:28:72:530:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:price elasticity of demand for medical care is less than one, the SR should also reduce total out-
12:319:24733:28:28:72:251:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:of-pocket spending for medical care. 
12:320:24770:28:27:108:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:Preventive Health Services.  Most preventive services in Colombia are free regardless of 
12:321:24859:27:28:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance status (i.e., free both for SR enrollees and the uninsured), so the main difference in 
12:322:24956:28:27:72:538:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for preventive care originate on the supply-side.  Primary care providers are paid on a 
12:323:25055:27:25:72:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:capitated basis, so they have strong incentives to limit total primary care spending.  Increasing

12:326:25307:16:11:71:533:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2010a), and Anderson, Dobkin, and Gross (2012) for recent regression discontinuity studies of health insurance in 
12:327:25422:11:12:71:523:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:the United States. For recent work on the United States using other methodologies, see Doyle (2005), Dafny and 
12:328:25533:12:11:71:513:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:Gruber (2005), Finkelstein (2007), Finkelstein and McKnight (2008), Kolstad and Kowalski (2010), Chandra, 
12:329:25639:11:0:71:292:74:100:Times:144:Times:B:Gruber, and McKnight (2010b), and Kowalski (2011). 
13:330:25692:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:preventive service use can reduce the need for more costly curative care – and can therefore be 
13:331:25788:27:28:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost-saving – so capitated primary care incentives are likely to increase preventive care use.15   
13:332:25887:28:27:107:507:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:An opposing force at work is ex ante moral hazard: SR enrollees may have weaker 
13:333:25967:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives to use preventive services because they pay less for curative care (Nordquist and Wu 
13:334:26063:28:28:71:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:1976, Phelps 1978).  Although we fail to find evidence of ex ante moral hazard (as shown in 
13:335:26155:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 5.5) and there is little evidence of it in other studies (Kenkel 2000), our preventive care 
13:336:26255:27:28:71:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates reflect the net effect of these forces.16  Because preventive services generate important 
13:337:26355:28:27:72:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive externalities (both pecuniary and infectious disease-related), increases in their use 
13:338:26450:27:28:72:235:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:presumably improve welfare.17     
13:339:26484:28:28:108:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Curative Medical Care.  Three changes under the SR are likely to influence the use of 
13:340:26570:28:27:72:511:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:curative medical care: reductions in out-of-pocket prices, increases in the use of preventive 
13:341:26664:27:28:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:services, and supply-side incentives for limiting total medical spending.  First, for negative price 
13:342:26765:28:27:72:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:elasticities of demand, reductions in out-of-pocket prices will increase the use of curative care.  
13:343:26865:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:This increase is inefficient under standard assumptions (ex post moral hazard); however, curative 
13:344:26963:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:care in developing countries may produce positive externalities, and there may also be important 
13:345:27060:27:28:72:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:credit constraints.  Second, any increases in preventive service use may reduce the use of 
13:346:27151:28:28:72:494:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:curative care (an efficient result).  Third, both capitation and utilization review produce 
13:347:27243:28:27:72:509:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for providers to limit the use of curative medical care.  Some reductions may be 
13:348:27335:27:34:72:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficient (counterbalancing demand-side incentives leading to ex post moral hazard) while others

13:350:27481:8:16:72:540:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:15 One randomized controlled trial in the US and another in the UK show that capitation increases preventive service 
13:351:27598:16:11:71:533:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:use (Manning et al. 1984, Lennon et al. 1990). This finding is also consistent with the evidence from observational 
13:352:27714:11:7:71:461:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:studies summarized by Miller and Luft (1994) and more recent research by Keenan et al. (2009). 
13:353:27808:7:16:72:537:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:16 The RAND Health Insurance Experiment reports no sizeable or significant effect of insurance coverage on health 
13:354:27922:16:12:71:519:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:behaviors (smoking, drinking, and exercise) (Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 1993).  Medicare 
13:355:28028:12:7:71:456:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:coverage has also been reported not to increase unhealthy behaviors (Dave and Kaestner 2006). 
13:356:28122:7:16:72:522:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:17 Popular conditional cash transfer programs – including the Familias en Acción program in Colombia – aim to 
13:357:28232:16:11:71:540:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:increase the use of preventive services even though they are otherwise available for free.  At least eleven developing 
13:358:28351:11:0:71:456:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:countries have introduced such conditional cash transfer programs (Fiszbein and Schady 2009). 
14:359:28448:0:27:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:may be inefficient (leading to “stinting” – see for example Ellis and McGuire (1990), Holmstrom 
14:360:28544:27:28:72:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Milgrom (1991), Ma and McGuire (1997), and McGuire (2000)).  Predictions about changes 
14:361:28635:28:27:72:512:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:in curative care under the SR as well as their welfare implications are therefore ambiguous. 
14:362:28728:27:28:108:488:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Health Outcomes.  Both preventive and curative services are inputs into health 
14:363:28807:28:28:72:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:production.  If at least one of these two types of care increases and neither of them decreases, 
14:364:28904:28:27:72:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:health should presumably improve to some degree.  Alternatively, the prediction is ambiguous if 
14:365:29000:27:28:72:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:one type increases and the other decreases.  In our empirical analyses, we are able to examine the 
14:366:29099:28:27:72:539:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevalence of infectious diseases common among children (diarrhea, cough and fever) as well as 
14:367:29194:27:28:72:240:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:the number of days lost to illness.

14:371:29271:28:27:108:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our empirical approach requires household survey data containing three types of 
14:372:29351:27:28:72:514:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:information: (1) enrollment in the SR, (2) components of the SISBEN index (enabling us to 
14:373:29441:28:27:72:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:simulate SR eligibility), and (3) potential behavioral responses and outcomes of interest (both 
14:374:29537:27:28:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:welfare-improving and distortionary).  There are two candidate Colombian household surveys 
14:375:29628:28:28:72:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:that meet these criteria: the Encuestas de Calidad de Vida (ECV) and the Demographic and 
14:376:29717:28:27:72:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Health Surveys (DHS).  The ECVs are nationally-representative household surveys designed to 
14:377:29809:27:28:72:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure socio-economic well-being and “quality of life,” broadly defined.  The DHS data 
14:378:29897:28:27:72:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:reports detailed fertility, health, and socio-economic information for nationally-representative 
14:379:29994:27:28:72:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:samples of fertile age women (defined as ages 15-49) and their households.  Because the de facto 
14:380:30090:28:0:72:530:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:implementation of the SR occurred in 1996/1997, we use the 2003 ECV and the 2005 DHS for 
15:381:30182:0:27:72:516:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:our analyses.18  Table 1 shows descriptive statistics by type of behavior/outcome for the full 
15:382:30277:27:28:72:343:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:samples as well as those with and without SR coverage. 
15:383:30332:28:27:108:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:As our empirical strategy requires, we calculate household-level SISBEN scores to 
15:384:30414:27:28:72:536:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:simulate SR eligibility because simulated eligibility should not reflect manipulation of  SISBEN 
15:385:30511:28:28:72:496:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:scores (Camacho and Conover 2011).19  However, not all household surveys contain all 
15:386:30596:28:27:72:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessary components of the SISBEN index.  Appendix 2 provides a complete description of the 
15:387:30689:27:28:72:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:SISBEN components present in each survey.20  We impute values using ordered probit models 
15:388:30779:28:27:72:530:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the few variables that are missing (firm size and per-capita income in the DHS and primary 
15:389:30874:27:28:72:224:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:roof material in both surveys).  
15:390:30907:28:28:72:183:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2 Empirical Strategy 
15:391:30930:28:27:72:342:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Instrumenting for Enrollment with Simulated Eligibility 
15:392:30986:27:28:108:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:In principle, the SISBEN index’s SR eligibility threshold can be used to study behavioral 
15:393:31076:28:27:72:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:responses associated with SR enrollment.  This discontinuity induces an abrupt shift in eligibility 
15:394:31176:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and enrollment) along otherwise smooth distributions of household characteristics; coincident 
15:395:31271:28:27:71:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:shifts in behaviors and outcomes can reasonably be linked to the program.  However, adverse or 
15:396:31366:27:28:71:501:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:propitious selection into eligibility – or manipulation according to unobserved household 
15:397:31456:28:28:71:529:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics, as discussed in Section 2.5 – is likely to bias the estimates of interest (McCrary 
15:398:31556:28:27:71:105:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:2008). 
15:399:31563:27:28:107:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:To circumvent this difficulty, we employ an instrumental variables strategy closely 
15:400:31647:28:29:71:540:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:resembling one proposed by Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001).  Conceptually, we seek to

15:402:31788:8:16:72:524:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:18 There was also a Colombian DHS survey conducted in 2000, but it is much smaller and contains few outcome 
15:403:31896:16:11:71:522:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:variables of interest.  We do not use the 1997 wave of the ECV because SR enrollment was still very low in that 
15:404:32008:11:7:71:93:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:year. 
15:405:32014:7:12:72:375:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:19 Official SISBEN scores are also not available in the datasets that we use. 
15:406:32092:12:16:72:511:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 In theory, SISBEN scores should be calculated at the family (or “nucleus”) level.  However, we treat entire 
15:407:32203:16:11:71:535:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:households as families given reports that SISBEN enumerators adopted this definition in practice due to difficulties 
15:408:32320:11:0:71:238:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:in conforming to the technical definition. 
16:409:32366:0:27:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:reconstruct ‘true’ SISBEN scores when both official SISBEN scores and observed SR enrollment 
16:410:32459:27:28:72:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflect manipulation.  To do so, we calculate SISBEN scores for each household in the ECV and 
16:411:32553:28:27:72:498:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:DHS data and then use calculated scores to instrument for SR enrollment (for prominent 
16:412:32640:27:28:72:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:examples of simulated instruments, see Currie and Gruber (1996a and 1996b), and Cutler and 
16:413:32731:28:28:72:253:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gruber (1996), and Hoxby (2001)).21 
16:414:32766:28:27:108:499:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:Using urban households with simulated SISBEN scores near the urban eligibility 
16:415:32845:27:28:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:threshold (we do not use rural households because of sufficiently inconsistent application of the 
16:416:32943:28:27:71:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:rural scale)22, we could in principle begin by estimating the following first-stage equation for 
16:417:33040:27:28:72:211:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals i in household h: 
16:418:33070:28:28:72:382:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1) enrollih = α + γbelowh + βSISBENh + Σkδkestratohk + εih, 
16:419:33131:28:27:71:515:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:where enroll is an indicator for whether or not individual i is enrolled in the SR, below is an 
16:420:33227:27:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicator for simulated SISBEN score lying below the eligibility threshold, SISBEN is simulated 
16:421:33323:28:27:71:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:SISBEN score, and estrato is a dummy variable for an estrato category (a neighborhood-level 
16:422:33415:27:28:71:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure of socio-economic status used to establish electricity prices paid by local households).  
16:423:33513:28:27:71:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), we could then estimate the following second-stage 
16:424:33601:27:28:71:119:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation: 
16:425:33611:28:28:71:399:267:144:Times:144:Times:B: (2) outcomeih = φ + λenrollih + θSISBENh + Σkπkestratohk + ξih, 
16:426:33676:28:27:72:524:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:instrumeting for enroll with below.  The relationship between behavioral outcomes of interest 
16:427:33770:27:23:72:493:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:(outcome) and SR enrollment would then be captured by estimates of the parameter λ.   
16:428:33856:23:7:72:219:189:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
16:429:33905:7:16:72:536:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 We emphasize “old” SISBEN scores – those calculated using the official scale in effect between the beginning of 
16:430:34020:16:12:71:536:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:the SR and 2003.  Enrollees eligible only under the old scale were not disenrolled with the introduction of the “new 
16:431:34137:12:7:71:428:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:scale,” and the old (but not the new) eligibility discontinuity is evident in the 2005 DHS. 
16:432:34229:7:16:72:521:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 The combination of smaller sample size and inconsistent application of the scale in rural areas means that our 
16:433:34343:16:11:72:519:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:first-stage relationships are considerably weaker than in urban areas.  In the DHS, the first-stage F-statistics are 
16:434:34460:11:12:72:528:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:about 9 for the sample of children (N=574) and about 3 for the sample of mothers (N=302).  In the ECV, the first-
16:435:34573:12:11:72:519:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:stage F-statistics are about 18, but the size of the rural sample is roughly one quarter of the urban one (1318 vs. 
16:436:34689:11:12:72:103:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:4129).

17:439:34700:0:27:72:313:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Estimating County-Specific Eligibility Thresholds 
17:440:34750:27:28:108:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:?: As described in Section 2.5, financial shortfalls led many Colombian counties to use SR 
17:441:34838:28:27:71:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligibility thresholds at SISBEN scores below the official national threshold.  We therefore use 
17:442:34935:27:28:71:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:county-specific eligibility thresholds.   In addition to improving the strength of our first stage, 
17:443:35035:28:28:71:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:this approach offers another key benefit: because some local governments use the official 
17:444:35125:28:27:71:538:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:national threshold for other public benefits, changes in outcomes observed at county-specific SR 
17:445:35222:27:28:71:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:thresholds will not reflect behavioral responses to other public programs.  (Section 5.1 shows 
17:446:35317:28:27:71:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:that participation in other public programs is not discontinuous at county-specific thresholds.) 
17:447:35414:27:28:107:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Exact county-specific eligibility thresholds are unknown, so we estimate them following 
17:448:35502:28:28:71:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chay, McEwan, and Urquiola (2005).  Specifically, using our full samples, we establish county-
17:449:35596:28:27:71:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific breaks in SR eligibility at the SISBEN score that maximize the goodness-of-fit of a 
17:450:35689:27:28:71:485:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:model of SR enrollment as a function of a dichotomous indicator for whether or not a 
17:451:35774:28:27:71:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:household’s score falls below the threshold.23  This approach establishes thresholds that 
17:452:35864:27:28:72:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximize the percentage of individuals correctly classified as eligible in each county.  Threshold 
17:453:35963:28:27:72:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:means in the ECV and DHS are 45.03 and 45.83, respectively, and their interquantile ranges are 
17:454:36058:27:28:72:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.96 and 3.89.  Intuitively, estimated thresholds are positively correlated with current county 
17:455:36154:28:28:72:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:income (the sum of taxes, transfers from the state, and non-tax income) and negatively correlated 
17:456:36252:28:38:72:352:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the share of households having unmet basic needs.24  
17:457:36310:38:8:72:219:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
17:458:36359:8:16:72:541:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 There are 84 counties in the ECV and 220 counties in the DHS. We exclude individuals from a few counties using 
17:459:36473:16:11:71:513:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:two criteria related to having very few observations in some counties.  One is having the first percentile in the 
17:460:36587:11:12:71:506:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:SISBEN score distribution lie above the national threshold or the 99th percentile score lie below the national 
17:461:36698:12:11:71:523:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:threshold.  The other is having an estimated threshold with those below it having relatively lower SR enrollment 
17:462:36811:11:12:71:538:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:rates than those above it.  The total number of observations excluded for these reasons is minor (3.8% of the sample 
17:463:36928:12:7:72:539:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:in the ECV data and 5.2% of the sample in the DHS data). Estimated thresholds are constrained to be lower than 49. 
17:464:37043:7:16:72:529:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 To assess this, we ran an OLS regression of county-specific eligibility thresholds on current county income and 
17:465:37158:16:11:71:504:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:the share of households in the county having unmet basic needs (a composite indicator that collapses across 
17:466:37266:11:12:71:509:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:household population density, water source, toilet availability at home, education of household head, ratio of 
17:467:37377:12:11:71:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:employed household members to all household members, and children’s school attendance rate). Using the ECV 
17:468:37484:11:0:71:535:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:sample, the estimate for current county income is 0.0091 with a standard error of 0.004; in the DHS, the estimate is 
18:469:37604:0:27:108:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:We then use county-specific thresholds to re-code the variable below for each individual i 
18:470:37694:27:28:72:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:in households h and Colombian counties c and estimate the following first stage equation: 
18:471:37784:28:27:72:503:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3) enrollihc = α + γbelowhc + βSISBENh + φSISBEN_diffhc + Σkδkestratohk + μc + εihc, 
18:472:37869:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:where below is now an indicator for whether or not individual i’s simulated SISBEN score falls 
18:473:37964:28:28:71:500:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:below the eligibility threshold in the individual’s county c, SISBEN_diff is the difference 
18:474:38056:28:27:71:526:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:between an individual’s simulated SISBEN score and the estimated eligibility threshold in the 
18:475:38150:27:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual’s county (i.e., relative SISBEN score), μc represents county fixed effects (allowing us 
18:476:38249:28:27:72:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:to focus on within-county variation in simulated eligibility across county-specific thresholds), 
18:477:38346:27:28:71:532:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:and all other variables are defined as in equation (1).  To adhere transparently to the identifying 
18:478:38446:28:28:72:489:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumption that individuals with simulated SISBEN scores very near the threshold are 
18:479:38531:28:27:72:537:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparable with the exception of their eligibility, we conservatively focus on individuals whose 
18:480:38628:27:28:72:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculated scores lie within two index points of the county-specific cutoff (our main estimates 
18:481:38724:28:27:72:370:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:persist across various bandwidths, as shown in Section 5.6).25 
18:482:38786:27:28:108:538:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figures 1A and 1B use ECV and DHS data to show SR enrollment and “uninsurance” by 
18:483:38868:28:27:71:501:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:simulated SISBEN score relative to county-specific eligibility thresholds.  Each county’s 
18:484:38958:27:28:72:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:threshold is normalized to zero, and the figure then shows means and 95% confidence intervals 
18:485:39052:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:for each SISBEN index integer relative to the threshold as well as non-parametric kernel density 
18:486:39149:28:27:72:543:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:plots on either side.  The figure illustrates large discrete increases in the probability of enrollment 
18:487:39253:27:28:72:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:and concomitant decreases in the probability of uninsurance at the threshold ranging between 25 
18:488:39349:28:29:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 30 percentage points.  Figures 2A and 2B show the enrollment and “uninsurance” separately 
18:489:39442:29:12:72:543:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                             
18:490:39599:12:12:72:542:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:0.0043 with a standard error of 0.002.  For the share of households with unmet basic needs, the estimates are -0.0456 
18:491:39717:12:7:72:341:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:and -0.0444 with standard errors of 0.024 and 0.015, respectively.  
18:492:39785:7:16:72:532:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:25 Because eligibility thresholds vary by county, our approach essentially averages across sample respondents with 
18:493:39900:16:11:71:520:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:different absolute SISBEN scores.  To investigate how our estimates vary with absolute SISBEN score, we also 
18:494:40009:11:12:71:509:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimate variants of equation (4) below with interactions between SR enrollment and absolute SISBEN score 
18:495:40115:12:11:71:535:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:(instrumenting for this term with interactions between an indicator for falling below county-specific thresholds and 
18:496:40232:11:0:71:468:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:absolute SISBEN score) and find insignificant estimates for this interaction term (see Section 5.7). 
19:497:40336:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:by regions of Colombia as well. It is worth noting than SR enrollment falls short of 100% at low 
19:498:40433:27:28:72:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(calculated) SISBEN scores.  This may not only be due to mistargeting, but also to our use of 
19:499:40527:28:27:72:447:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:household survey data (rather than official data) to construct SISBEN scores   
19:500:40606:27:28:108:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Using our re-coded variable below to instrument for enroll, we then estimate the 
19:501:40687:28:28:72:214:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:following equation by 2SLS: 
19:502:40715:28:27:72:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(4) outcomeihc = φ + λenrollihc + θSISBENh + ψSISBEN_diffhc + Σkπkestratohk + μc + ξihc, 
19:503:40803:27:28:71:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:where the estimate of interest is the estimate of λ.26 Section 5.6 shows that our results are robust 
19:504:40904:28:27:72:493:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:across bandwidths to including higher-order relative SISBEN score polynomials, using 
19:505:40989:27:28:72:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:interactions between relative SISBEN scores and simulated eligibility, and excluding county 
19:506:41081:28:28:72:535:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects.  We also estimate λ using local linear regression without any covariates other than 
19:507:41180:28:27:72:194:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative SISBEN score.27 
19:508:41204:27:28:72:254:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Limitations of the Empirical Strategy 
19:509:41242:28:27:108:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although our approach addresses key irregularities in SR implementation, it also has 
19:510:41327:27:28:72:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:shortcomings.  First, because the ECV and DHS household survey data that we use to calculate 
19:511:41420:28:27:72:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:SISBEN scores was collected after official SISBEN classification, our calculations presumably 
19:512:41514:27:28:72:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:include measurement error (even absent manipulation of official SISBEN status).  Second, our 
19:513:41607:28:28:72:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of county-specific eligibility thresholds presumably do not match those used in practice 
19:514:41706:28:27:72:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:exactly, introducing additional noise into the relationship between our measure of simulated 
19:515:41799:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligibility and actual enrollment. Third, manipulation of official SISBEN scores further weakens 
19:516:41896:28:27:72:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the strength of the first stage relationship.  Fourth, our sample sizes are relatively small in the 
19:517:41996:27:37:72:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:neighborhood of the eligibility thresholds. Overall, these limitations clearly compromise the

19:519:42139:7:16:72:523:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 We estimate equations (3) and (4) using linear models; marginal probabilities computed using bivariate probit 
19:520:42252:16:12:71:532:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:models yield similar results to the 2SLS estimates for dichotomous outcomes examined throughout the paper.  We 
19:521:42363:12:7:71:270:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:calculate our standard errors clustered by county. 
19:522:42414:7:0:72:496:78:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 For comparison, we also estimate equation (4) by OLS and show the results at the bottom of our tables. 
20:523:42523:0:27:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:power of our estimates (few are significant at significance thresholds below α=0.10) and suggest 
20:524:42620:27:28:72:363:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:that our results should also be interpreted as lower bounds.

20:527:42694:28:28:108:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:This section presents empirical evidence on a variety of important behavioral responses 
20:528:42782:28:27:72:542:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the SR.  We begin by demonstrating that both background characteristics not influenced by the 
20:529:42879:27:28:72:537:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:program and participation in other social programs using SISBEN are balanced across estimated 
20:530:42973:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:SR eligibility thresholds. We then investigate the effectiveness of health insurance in protecting 
20:531:43072:27:28:72:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:households against financial risk (and possibly changing the optimal composition of household 
20:532:43166:28:28:72:491:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending and assets).  Next, we study changes in the use of traditionally under-utilized 
20:533:43255:28:27:72:530:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:preventive services in light of the SR’s emphasis on allocative efficiency.  In doing so, we also 
20:534:43353:27:28:72:499:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine changes in health outcomes that are sensitive to the use of important preventive 
20:535:43442:28:27:72:505:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:services.   We then analyze how SR enrollment is related to changes in the use of curative 
20:536:43533:27:28:72:526:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:medicine.  To investigate possible behavioral distortions, we also test for reductions in private 
20:537:43631:28:27:72:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:health investments (ex ante moral hazard) and insurance ‘crowd-out’ associated with SR 
20:538:43718:27:28:72:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment.  Finally, we assess the robustness of our estimates through a variety of additional 
20:539:43814:28:28:72:303:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:parametric and non-parametric specifications.28 
20:540:43861:28:27:72:345:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.1 Balance across Discontinuous Eligibility Thresholds 
20:541:43917:27:28:108:529:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our empirical approach assumes that no individual or household characteristics – other 
20:542:44004:28:27:72:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:than SR enrollment – that could influence the outcomes of interest vary discontinuously across 
20:543:44099:27:37:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:our estimated eligibility thresholds.  To test this assumption, Table 2 shows results obtained by 
20:544:44197:37:7:72:219:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
20:545:44246:7:16:72:535:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:28 As expected, power is lower in all analyses if we use the uniform national threshold rather than estimated county-
20:546:44363:16:12:72:526:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:specific ones.  In contrast to the F statistics shown in our main tables, using the uniform national threshold yields 
20:547:44481:12:11:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:first stage F statics of 4.7 in the ECV and 18 in the DHS. Even so, many of our key results on health care use and 
20:548:44596:11:0:72:415:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:health outcomes are nonetheless present when we use the uniform national threshold. 
21:549:44683:0:27:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimating equations (3) and (4) for individual attributes that could not reasonably change in 
21:550:44778:27:28:72:540:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:response to SR enrollment (such as age or educational attainment among adults). Consistent with 
21:551:44874:28:27:71:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:our assumption, the estimates are not generally distinguishable from zero.  (Examining the 
21:552:44965:27:28:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of simulated SISBEN scores across eligibility discontinuities, Appendix 3 shows 
21:553:45058:28:28:71:303:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence in support of this assumption as well.) 
21:554:45107:28:27:107:527:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:We then consider whether or not our estimates from equation (4) could be attributed to 
21:555:45194:27:28:71:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation in other public programs that also use the SISBEN index.   Before investigating this 
21:556:45293:28:27:71:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility directly, we first note that it is unlikely because these programs use the uniform 
21:557:45388:27:28:71:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:national eligibility threshold, while we estimate and utilize de facto county-specific thresholds 
21:558:45486:28:28:71:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the SR – many of which fall below the uniform national threshold.  To confirm this, we re-
21:559:45580:28:27:71:514:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate equations (3) and (4) using a dichotomous indicator for participation in these other 
21:560:45674:27:28:71:510:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs – including job training, home mortgage subsidies, education vouchers, Hogares 
21:561:45762:28:27:71:541:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Comunitarios (a large child care program), and services provided by the Instituto Colombiano de 
21:562:45858:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Bienestar Familiar (the largest social welfare agency in Colombia) – as the dependent variable in 
21:563:45956:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:equation (4).29  Table 2 presents these results, suggesting that participation in other programs is 
21:564:46056:27:28:72:372:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:also balanced across county-specific SR eligibility thresholds.

21:566:46171:28:27:108:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although a key innovation of the SR is its emphasis on allocative efficiency, a central 
21:567:46259:27:28:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:objective of any health insurance program is to provide protection against financial risk.  We 
21:568:46354:28:18:72:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:therefore begin by examining the relationship between SR enrollment and both level and 
21:569:46441:18:7:72:219:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
21:570:46490:7:16:72:519:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 The program Empleo en Acción (a workfare program active in 2003 but abolished in 2004) is the only public 
21:571:46599:16:12:71:520:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:program of which we are aware that used the uniform national SISBEN eligibility threshold for which the 2003 
21:572:46708:12:11:71:535:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:ECV does not contain data.  Participation in the program was low (only 7.4% of those in SISBEN strata 1 or 2) and 
21:573:46822:11:12:71:520:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:provided no benefits directly related to health (it paid 60% of the minimum wage to individuals who worked on 
21:574:46932:12:11:71:541:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:official program projects an average of at least 30 hours per week for 2.4 months) (IFS-SEI-Econometria 2005).  We 
21:575:47047:11:12:71:535:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:do not have information about participation in Familias en Acción, a Colombian conditional cash transfer program, 
21:576:47161:12:11:71:529:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:but the eligibility threshold for this program (36) is considerably lower, falling more than two standard deviations 
21:577:47278:11:0:71:265:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:below the mean of our estimated SR thresholds. 
22:578:47328:0:27:72:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:variability of out-of-pocket medical spending.  To construct our variability measure, we first 
22:579:47423:27:28:72:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculate mean individual spending separately among those enrolled and those not enrolled in the 
22:580:47520:28:27:72:543:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:SR.  For each individual, we then measure the difference between each individual’s spending and 
22:581:47616:27:28:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the mean among those with the same enrollment status, constructing our variability measure as 
22:582:47710:28:28:71:542:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:the absolute value of this difference.  We analyze outpatient and inpatient out-of-pocket spending 
22:583:47809:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(within the past twelve months) separately and emphasize the latter because of idiosyncrasies in 
22:584:47906:27:28:71:258:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:how outpatient spending is reported.30 
22:585:47944:28:27:108:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:We first graphically examine shifts in the distribution of medical spending associated 
22:586:48031:27:28:71:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:with simulated eligibility for the SR.  Figure 3 shows cumulative density functions for inpatient 
22:587:48129:28:28:72:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:medical spending in the preceding year separately for those falling above and below county-
22:588:48220:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific thresholds (using our sample of those within two index points of the cutoff).31  Both 
22:589:48315:27:28:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:distributions are heavily right-skewed, but mass in the distribution for those who are eligible 
22:590:48411:28:27:72:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:(those below the threshold) falls to the left of the distribution for those who are ineligible.  No 
22:591:48511:27:28:71:534:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:clearly comparable pattern is present for outpatient medical spending (Figure 4).  Overall, these 
22:592:48609:28:27:71:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:figures suggest that SR eligibility is associated with reductions in right-tail inpatient medical 
22:593:48707:27:28:71:331:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending – a pattern consistent with risk protection.32 
22:594:48762:28:28:107:541:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:The first four columns of Panel A in Table 3 then present econometric results obtained by 
22:595:48852:28:15:71:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimating equations (3) and (4) for medical spending by type.  The first row presents IV

22:597:48991:8:16:72:532:216:42:Times:100:Times:F:30 The ECV 2003 question about outpatient spending in the preceding 30 days excludes outpatient costs associated 
22:598:49104:16:11:71:540:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:with illness ultimately leading to hospitalization; the inpatient expenditure question asks about all inpatient spending 
22:599:49225:11:7:71:161:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:in the past 12 months. 
22:600:49248:7:16:72:522:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:31 These graphs do not correspond exactly to our formal RD estimates for several reasons.  One is that they only 
22:601:49361:16:12:71:525:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:include observations with positive expenditures and hence do not capture differential selection into any spending 
22:602:49475:12:11:71:526:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:between those above vs. below the eligibility threshold.  Another is that using our bandwidth of two sample, they 
22:603:49589:11:12:71:538:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:depict mean differences between those above vs. below the eligibility threshold (rather than differences between the 
22:604:49706:12:11:71:529:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:two groups as one converges to the threshold from above vs. below).  Conducting a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for 
22:605:49816:11:12:71:509:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:equality of distributions, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis of equality, presumably because of these 
22:606:49928:12:7:71:495:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:limitations and small sample sizes when conditioning on any spending.  They are nonetheless suggestive. 
22:607:50032:7:16:72:540:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:32 These figures may understate the magnitude of risk protection under the SR for two reasons: (1) some people may 
22:608:50147:16:11:71:535:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:not receive medical care at all, but nonetheless incur non-medical financial expenses due to poor health, and (2) the 
22:609:50265:11:0:72:483:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:figures show densities by eligibility rather than enrollment status (because enrollment is endogenous). 
23:610:50372:0:27:72:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates for SR enrollment, and the second row reports intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates for 
23:611:50464:27:28:71:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:simulated SR eligibility (estimates for a dummy variable coding whether or not an individual 
23:612:50557:28:27:71:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:falls below the eligibility threshold obtained by OLS regressions of outcomes on this dummy and 
23:613:50653:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the other covariates in equation 4).  The first column suggests that SR enrollment lowers mean 
23:614:50748:28:28:71:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:inpatient spending by about 60,000 pesos (α=0.10), around a 30% reduction among those using 
23:615:50840:28:27:71:534:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:any inpatient services.  Perhaps more importantly for assessing protection against financial risk, 
23:616:50939:27:28:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the third column shows that SR enrollment is associated with reductions in the variability of 
23:617:51033:28:27:72:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:inpatient medical spending (α=0.05).33  There is no statistically significant association for 
23:618:51127:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:outpatient care. Appendix 4 Figure 1 graphically shows all outcomes examined in Panel A across 
23:619:51222:28:28:71:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:county-specific eligibility thresholds (essentially, graphical versions of our intent-to-treat 
23:620:51317:28:27:71:122:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyses). 
23:621:51328:27:28:107:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Overall, the results shown in Table 3 Panel A suggest that SR enrollment is associated 
23:622:51415:28:27:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:with meaningful risk protection benefits.  By reducing household exposure to financial risk, SR 
23:623:51511:27:28:71:511:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment could also produce meaningful changes in the composition of household assets, 
23:624:51600:28:27:71:492:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:human capital investments, and household consumption (i.e., portfolio choice effects).  
23:625:51688:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically, it may increase investments not previously undertaken because of costly informal 
23:626:51783:28:28:71:542:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk-management activities (such as precautionary saving).  Panel B of Table 3 presents estimates 
23:627:51881:28:27:71:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:for durable goods not used to construct the SISBEN index (car and radio ownership) as well as 
23:628:51975:27:28:71:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:household education and consumption expenditures.  In general, it implies that SR enrollment is 
23:629:52071:28:27:71:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:not associated with discernible portfolio choice effects (perhaps because the SR falls short of 
23:630:52167:27:37:71:196:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:providing full insurance). 
23:631:52194:37:7:71:218:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
23:632:52243:7:16:72:534:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:33 Although this result is unsurprising given that Colombia’s reform caps the amount that SR enrollees are required 
23:633:52359:16:12:71:521:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:to pay out-of-pocket, it cannot be taken for granted in a developing country context. For example, Wagstaff and 
23:634:52471:12:11:71:537:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:Lindelow (2008) find that health insurance in China increases financial risk due to a combination of poor regulation 
23:635:52588:11:0:71:192:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:and asymmetric information.  
24:636:52620:0:27:72:293:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.3 Preventive Service Use and Health Status 
24:637:52665:27:28:108:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:As described earlier, a key innovation of the SR is its focus on improving allocative 
24:638:52751:28:27:72:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:efficiency in medical care.  In particular, increasing the use of highly beneficial preventive 
24:639:52846:27:28:72:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:services – many of which produce large positive externalities – is likely to improve welfare.  
24:640:52941:28:28:72:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:These externalities are due both to reduced rates of infectious disease transmission and to 
24:641:53033:28:27:72:376:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduced curative care costs borne by others through risk pools. 
24:642:53097:27:28:108:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:The first two columns of Table 4 report estimates for different types of preventive care 
24:643:53186:28:27:72:526:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:use obtained from equations (3) and (4) (Appendix 4 Figure 2 shows graphical versions of the 
24:644:53279:27:28:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:intent-to-treat analyses).  In general, they suggest substantial increases in the use of preventive 
24:645:53379:28:28:72:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:health care services.34  Specifically, SR enrollment is associated with a 29 percentage point 
24:646:53473:28:27:72:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in the probability of a preventive physician visit in the past year (a 75% increase; 
24:647:53567:27:28:72:541:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:Times:B:α=0.01).  Importantly, the SR is also associated with 1.50 more growth-monitoring and well-care 
24:648:53663:28:27:72:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:visits in the past year, a 50% increase relative to uninsured children (α=0.05).  These well-care 
24:649:53761:27:28:72:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:visits are a principal way of addressing important childhood health problems (parents receive 
24:650:53855:28:27:72:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:nutritional advice, iron supplements, and de-worming medications, for example – which are 
24:651:53945:27:28:72:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:important for strengthening children’s immune systems and making them less susceptible to 
24:652:54035:28:28:72:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:major childhood illnesses such as severe diarrhea and acute respiratory infections/pneumonia).35 
24:653:54131:28:27:107:496:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:We then investigate whether or not health status has improved under the SR – in 
24:654:54211:27:28:71:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:particular, dimensions of health that are sensitive to the use of preventive care.  Although our 
24:655:54308:28:27:71:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:preventive physician visit variable is not service-specific, our measure of childhood growth and 
24:656:54405:27:37:71:523:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:development checks should correspond directly with infectious disease prevalence.  Columns 
24:657:54496:37:7:71:218:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
24:658:54545:7:16:72:512:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:34 This increase in preventive care use dominates any ex ante moral hazard (which would reduce prevention – 
24:659:54653:16:7:71:346:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:although Section 5.5 suggests no evidence of ex ante moral hazard). 
24:660:54721:7:16:72:535:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:35 See Fogel (1994), Santos et al. (2001), Alderman (2007), Currie et al. (2008), Galasso and Umapathi (2009), and 
24:661:54836:16:0:71:454:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:Linnemayr and Alderman (2011) on the relationship between preventive care and child health.  
25:662:54932:0:27:72:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:three through six of Table 4 show estimates for child health outcomes linked to preventive care 
25:663:55028:27:28:72:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:use.  SR enrollment is associated with 1.4 fewer child days absent from usual activities due to 
25:664:55124:28:27:72:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:illness in the past month (α=0.05).  Enrollment is also associated with an 18 percentage point 
25:665:55219:27:28:72:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduction in the self-reported incidence of cough, fever, or diarrhea among children in the 
25:666:55311:28:28:72:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:preceding two weeks (but it is not statistically significant at conventional levels).  Appendix 4 
25:667:55409:28:27:72:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figure 2 shows graphical versions of the intent-to-treat analyses for these health outcomes as 
25:668:55504:27:28:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:well.36  Because these health gains can be linked to increases in preventive service use, they are 
25:669:55603:28:27:72:222:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:also likely to improve welfare. 
25:670:55635:27:28:72:237:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.4 Use of Curative Medical Care 
25:671:55668:28:28:108:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:?: As Section 3 discusses, there are a variety of competing incentives and other forces 
25:672:55753:28:27:71:510:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:influencing curative medical care under the SR.  These include reductions in out-of-pocket 
25:673:55844:27:28:71:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:prices, increases in the use of preventive services, and supply-side incentives for limiting total 
25:674:55943:28:27:71:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:medical spending.  Predictions about changes in curative service use under the SR – and their 
25:675:56037:27:28:71:478:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:welfare implications – are therefore ambiguous, but they remain a central interest of 
25:676:56123:28:27:71:494:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:policymakers and are important for assessing the costs of Colombia’s innovative health 
25:677:56210:27:28:71:159:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance reform. 
25:678:56228:28:28:107:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 5 reports estimates for various categories of curative care obtained from equations 
25:679:56318:28:27:72:529:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3) and (4) (Appendix 4 Figure 3 shows graphical versions of the intent-to-treat analyses).  We 
25:680:56414:27:28:71:528:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:find that SR enrollment is associated with a 13 percentage point increase in reported physician 
25:681:56510:28:27:71:537:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:visits because of health problems within the past 30 days (α=0.05).  There is no change in use of 
25:682:56608:27:25:71:540:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:curative care among children, which may be due to improvements in child health associated with 
25:683:56703:25:8:71:218:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
25:684:56752:8:16:72:526:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:36 Interestingly, for some of the more statistically pronounced results (such as physician visits for preventive care 
25:685:56870:16:11:71:541:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:and children’s healthy days lost due to illness), the graphical pattern of results shown in Figure 2 Appendix 4 closely 
25:686:56990:11:12:71:533:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:resemble the graphical pattern enrollment in the SR shown in Figure 1: a more or less flat relationship to the left of 
25:687:57109:12:11:71:497:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:the threshold, and a monotonic relationship to the right of the threshold. Although suggestive, these shape 
25:688:57217:11:0:71:261:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:similarities must still be interpreted cautiously. 
26:689:57271:0:27:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:SR enrollment (as Table 4 shows).  Finally, there is no meaningful relationship at conventional 
26:690:57367:27:28:72:420:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:significance levels between participation in the SR and hospitalizations. 
26:691:57441:28:27:72:328:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.5 Ex Ante Moral Hazard and Insurance Crowd-Out 
26:692:57490:27:28:108:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Protection from financial risk associated with unexpected illness weakens private 
26:693:57572:28:28:72:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for costly health protection (ex ante moral hazard) (Pauly 1968).  Because we find 
26:694:57666:28:27:71:525:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence of greater risk protection, we investigate how protective private health behaviors not 
26:695:57762:27:28:71:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly linked to medical care change with SR enrollment.37  As Table 6 and Appendix 4 Figure 
26:696:57857:28:27:72:519:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:4 show, however, we find no meaningful change in breastfeeding or maternal investments in 
26:697:57947:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:fetal health (alcohol, drug, or tobacco use during pregnancy; or prenatal dietary supplementation 
26:698:58045:28:28:72:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:with iron, calcium, or folic acid), suggesting little ex ante moral hazard associated with SR 
26:699:58139:28:27:72:138:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment.38 
26:700:58152:27:28:108:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Manipulation of official SISBEN scores suggests that Colombians perceive benefits of 
26:701:58237:28:27:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:SR enrollment, so we also investigate the possibility that SR enrollment displaces other forms of 
26:702:58335:27:28:72:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:explicit health insurance.39  Table 6 also presents intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates obtained by 
26:703:58431:28:27:72:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimating equation (3) with dichotomous indicators for Regimen Contributivo enrollment, other 
26:704:58526:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:forms of health insurance (those for the military, police officers, and certain industrial groups 
26:705:58624:28:28:72:539:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:like oil industry workers, for example), and “uninsurance” as dependent variables.  The Regimen 
26:706:58720:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Contributivo estimates are generally small (-0.02 in the ECV and -0.05 in the DHS) and the latter 
26:707:58818:27:28:72:499:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:is statistically significant (α=0.05), suggesting that some modest crowding-out of formal 
26:708:58908:28:18:72:218:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance may have occurred. 
26:709:58937:18:7:72:219:166:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
26:710:58986:7:16:72:533:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:37 More generally, private health behaviors and public health services could theoretically be either complements or 
26:711:59102:16:12:71:535:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:substitutes for publicly provided health services.  While reductions in the price of medical care may raise the return 
26:712:59221:12:11:71:529:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:to private health investments given competing risks, cheaper health services could also instead ‘crowd-out’ costly 
26:713:59336:11:7:71:481:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:private health behaviors (Dow, Holmes, Philipson, and Sala-i-Martin 1999, Murphy and Topel 2003). 
26:714:59434:7:12:72:495:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:38 We cannot rule-out the possibility that social desirability bias in reporting might attenuate a true effect. 
26:715:59546:12:16:72:538:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:39 Formal sector employees are mandated to enroll in an employment-based health insurance system called Regimen 
26:716:59658:16:11:71:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:Contributivo.  This mandate holds even for individuals with SISBEN scores falling below the SISBEN eligibility 
26:717:59769:11:0:71:157:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:threshold for the SR. 
27:718:59794:0:27:72:148:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.6 Robustness 
27:719:59809:27:28:108:491:681:144:Times:144:Times:?:To investigate the robustness of our results, we estimate a variety of alternative 
27:720:59892:28:27:72:536:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:parametric and non-parametric specifications based on our main estimating equations.  First, we 
27:721:59988:27:28:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:re-estimate equations (3) and (4) using SISBEN score bandwidths ranging between two and four.  
27:722:60083:28:28:72:529:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Second, at each bandwidth we estimate specifications that include higher order polynomials of 
27:723:60177:28:27:72:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:relative SISBEN scores (including squared, cubic, and fourth power terms) as well as models 
27:724:60269:27:28:72:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:that include interactions between relative SISBEN scores and simulated eligibility (although 
27:725:60362:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:allowing SISBEN gradients to vary on either side of the eligibility threshold should matter little 
27:726:60461:27:28:72:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:given our narrow bandwidth).  Third, we re-estimate specifications that do not include county 
27:727:60555:28:28:72:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed effects (at each bandwidth), allowing us also to make cross-county comparisons among 
27:728:60646:28:27:72:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals with identical simulated SISBEN scores but that fall on opposite sides of county-
27:729:60739:27:28:72:542:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific eligibility thresholds.  Finally, we also estimate models using non-parametric local linear 
27:730:60840:28:27:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression.40 As Tables 1-4 of Appendix 5 show that our results are generally robust (with some 
27:731:60936:27:28:72:445:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in precision) across these alternative bandwidths and specifications. 
27:732:61016:28:27:71:266:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.7 Heterogeneity and External Validity 
27:733:61056:27:28:72:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:While RD estimates can have good internal validity, their external validity is often limited 
27:734:61149:28:28:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:because they typically utilize a sample only in the neighborhood of the discontinuity (Imbens and 
27:735:61247:28:27:72:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lemieux 2008, Lee and Lemieux 2010).  However, because SR eligibility thresholds vary by 
27:736:61336:27:28:72:527:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:county, our empirical strategy allows us to investigate the external validity of our estimates by 
27:737:61434:28:41:72:490:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:extending equation (4) to include interactions between absolute SISBEN score and SR 
27:738:61518:41:7:72:219:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
27:739:61567:7:16:72:511:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:40 Specifically, we use local linear regression functions with triangle kernels to estimate conditional means of 
27:740:61680:16:12:71:512:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:outcome variables (conditioning on SISBEN_diff) on either side of the eligibility threshold, and we repeat this 
27:741:61792:12:11:71:526:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimation process for enrollment in the SR.  We then construct Wald statistics using differences in the estimated 
27:742:61907:11:12:71:524:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:conditional means of the outcome variable on either side of the threshold as numerators and the difference in the 
27:743:62021:12:11:71:524:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:conditional mean of SR enrollment on either side of the threshold as the denominator.  We estimate our standard 
27:744:62133:11:0:71:484:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:errors using 250 bootstrap replications.  Details of the implementation can be found in Nichols (2007). 
28:745:62240:0:27:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:enrollment.41  This allows us to test for heterogeneity by SISBEN score, a summary measure of 
28:746:62334:27:28:72:470:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:socio-economic status.  As Appendix 6 Tables 1-4 show, we find little evidence of 
28:747:62416:28:27:72:502:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneous effects, suggesting that our estimates are not sensitive to local variation in 
28:748:62509:27:28:72:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:SISBEN scores and may therefore apply to a broader range of the Colombian population.42  We 
28:749:62601:28:28:71:504:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:note, however, that the interaction terms’ standard errors are large, so our power to detect 
28:750:62694:28:27:71:190:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:heterogeneity is limited.

28:753:62733:27:28:107:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:This paper studies the role of Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado in protecting the poor 
28:754:62817:28:28:71:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:against financial risk, influencing their use of health services, and ultimately affecting their 
28:755:62914:28:27:71:533:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:health status.  Unusual among middle- and low-income countries at the time of its introduction, 
28:756:63010:27:28:71:486:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:the SR is a publicly-financed health insurance program with features of managed care 
28:757:63095:28:27:71:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasizing allocative efficiency that are traditionally only found in wealthy countries.  We find 
28:758:63194:27:28:71:509:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence that the SR provides some protection against financial risk and is associated with 
28:759:63286:28:27:71:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater use of preventive services having positive externalities – as well as with measurable 
28:760:63380:27:28:71:213:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:health gains among children. 
28:761:63409:28:28:107:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:Pinpointing the mechanisms through which complex insurance programs such as SR 
28:762:63488:28:27:71:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:work is an important topic of future research.  In our case, because preventive services are 
28:763:63581:27:28:71:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:generally free regardless of insurance status, one plausible interpretation of the increase in 
28:764:63676:28:41:71:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevention that we observe links them to the SR’s high-powered supply-side incentives (if 
28:765:63766:41:7:71:218:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
28:766:63815:7:16:72:525:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:41 Specifically, we estimate: outcomeihc = φ + λenrollihc + θSISBENh +δ(enrollihc×SISBENh) + ψSISBEN_diffhc + 
28:767:63925:16:12:72:513:120:100:g_d0_f6:100:Times:F:Σkπkestratohk + μc + ξihc, using belowhc and (belowhc×SISBENh) as instruments.  All variables are defined as in 
28:768:64036:12:7:72:161:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:equations (3) and (4). 
28:769:64059:7:16:72:533:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:42 The fifth row of Appendix 6 Tables 1-4 shows implied effects of Subsidized Regime enrollment evaluated at the 
28:770:64172:16:11:72:537:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:average SISBEN score (45) and their accompanying p-values.  The magnitude and significance of these effect sizes 
28:771:64285:11:0:72:251:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:generally match the estimates in Tables 3-6. 
29:772:64333:0:27:72:525:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:providers with capitated contracts believe that prevention is cost-saving).  Another potentially 
29:773:64430:27:28:72:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:important channel is patient substitution from public to private sector providers contracting with 
29:774:64529:28:27:72:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance plans under the SR (if private providers were more likely to supply preventive care).  
29:775:64626:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Although we suspect that these two mechanisms may be most salient, we cannot rule out others 
29:776:64719:28:28:72:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(individual feeling more comfortable going to the doctor when insured, the provision of 
29:777:64807:28:27:72:465:570:144:Times:100:Times:B:insurance making the universal entitlement to preventive care more salient, etc.).  
29:778:64890:27:28:108:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:We conclude by emphasizing that the welfare-improving potential of SR has yet to be 
29:779:64974:28:27:72:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:fully realized.  For example, a variety of political concessions followed the creation of the SR – 
29:780:65073:27:28:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:including exemptions from the end of government subsidies as well as requirements that insurers 
29:781:65169:28:28:72:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:contract with public facilities for a minimum share of the services that they finance.  These 
29:782:65263:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:concessions presumably limit the ability of health plans to contract with medical care providers 
29:783:65360:27:0:72:401:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:in ways that best encourage higher quality and lower cost services.

56:1558:114980:14:14:120:526:682:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:The figure in this appendix plots histograms of simulated SISBEN scores relative to 
56:1559:115064:14:13:84:514:668:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:county-specific eligibility thresholds.  Using the ECV 2003, density in the distribution of 
56:1560:115156:13:14:84:527:655:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:relative SISBEN scores evolves smoothly across local thresholds.  There are some spikes in 
56:1561:115247:14:14:84:532:641:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:density at other scores (-3, 5, and 7 for example) that we presume to be idiosyncratic noise.1  
56:1562:115343:14:14:84:523:627:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:In the DHS 2005, we observe similar spikes, but one of them coincides with relative score  
56:1563:115434:14:14:84:520:613:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:-1.  The magnitude is comparable to those at other scores (4 and 8, for example) as well as 
56:1564:115526:14:13:84:520:599:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:spikes in the ECV 2003.  Given balance on observable characteristics across the eligibility 
56:1565:115618:13:14:84:509:586:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:threshold (shown in Table 2) as well as the fact that county-specific thresholds were not 
56:1566:115708:14:14:84:503:572:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:stipulated or even known ex ante, we believe that it is unlikely that simulated SISBEN 
56:1567:115795:14:14:84:479:558:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:scores are manipulated.  We also predict values for more index components when
