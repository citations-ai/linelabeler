2:22:959:28:29:108:540:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  paper  assesses  different  organizational  forms  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  generate
2:23:1059:29:28:72:540:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:information  about  investment  projects  and  allocate  capital  to  these  projects  efficiently.  A
2:24:1161:28:28:72:540:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralized  approach–with  small,  single-manager  firms–is  most  likely  to  be  attractive  when
2:25:1263:28:29:72:540:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:information  about  individual  projects  is  “soft”  and  cannot  be  credibly  transmitted.    Moreover,
2:26:1369:29:28:72:540:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:holding  fixed  firm  size,  soft  information  also  favors  flatter  organizations  with  fewer  layers  of
2:27:1478:28:28:72:540:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:management.    In  contrast,  large  hierarchical  firms  with  multiple  layers  of  management  are  at  a
2:28:1586:28:29:72:540:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative advantage when information can be costlessly  “hardened” and  passed along within the
2:29:1683:29:28:72:540:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy.  As  a  concrete  application  of  the  theory,  the  paper  discusses  the  consequences  of
2:30:1787:28:28:72:540:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:consolidation in the banking industry.  It has been documented that when large banks acquire small
2:31:1885:28:29:72:540:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks,  there  is  a  pronounced  decline  in  lending  to  small  businesses.    To  the  extent  that  small-
2:32:1996:29:28:72:540:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:business lending relies heavily on soft information, this is exactly what the theory would lead one
2:33:2095:28:85:72:125:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:to expect.

3:40:2224:0:19:108:536:120:52:Times:144:Times:A:1The literature on this topic is surveyed in Berger, Demsetz and Strahan (1999).  I discuss
3:41:2315:19:0:72:261:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:this work in detail in Section IV below.
3:42:2356:0:28:108:180:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:I.  Introduction
3:43:2372:28:29:108:530:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:In this paper, I take up the question of how an organization should be designed–in terms
3:44:2460:29:28:72:534:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:of size, number of managers, and the division of responsibility amongst these managers–so as to
3:45:2555:28:28:72:487:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:most efficiently allocate capital to competing investment projects.  I contrast two basic
3:46:2644:28:29:72:507:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizational forms.  The first is “decentralization”, in which small, single-manager firms
3:47:2736:29:28:72:518:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:choose between relatively few projects.  The second is “hierarchy”, in which large firms with
3:48:2829:28:28:72:532:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:multiple layers of management evaluate many projects.  The ultimate goal is to understand what
3:49:2923:28:29:72:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:project-level characteristics lead either decentralization or hierarchy to be the preferred design.
3:50:3022:29:28:108:532:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:This question can be given a very concrete motivation.  Over the last several years, there
3:51:3112:28:28:72:532:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:has been enormous consolidation in the banking industry, both in the U.S. and worldwide.  This
3:52:3206:28:29:72:524:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:consolidation has been accompanied by widely-voiced concerns that the resulting larger banks
3:53:3298:29:28:72:542:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:will lend less to small businesses, who are particularly dependent on intermediaries for financing. 
3:54:3398:28:28:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:And indeed, a number of researchers have documented that, when two banks merge, the resulting
3:55:3491:28:29:72:495:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:larger entity tends to cut back significantly on its small-business lending.  Moreover, the
3:56:3582:29:28:72:472:283:144:Times:52:Times:B:evidence suggests that the loans that are cut are, at least on average, positive-NPV.1
3:57:3668:28:28:108:521:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:Why would a newly-enlarged bank ever willingly turn its back on a profitable existing
3:58:3753:28:29:72:532:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:line of business in this manner?  The most common informal argument is nicely summarized by
3:59:3844:29:28:72:250:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:Berger, Demsetz and Strahan (1999):
3:60:3879:28:14:108:530:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:“The larger institutions created by consolidation may also choose to provide fewer retail
3:61:3968:14:0:72:476:156:144:Times:144:Times:B:services to small customers because of Williamson (1967, 1988) type organizational
4:62:4051:0:14:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:diseconomies....That is, it may be scope inefficient for one institution to produce outputs which
4:63:4148:14:14:72:537:694:144:Times:144:Times:B:may require implementation of quite different policies and procedures.  These diseconomies may
4:64:4242:14:14:72:508:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:be most likely to arise in providing services to informationally opaque small businesses for
4:65:4334:14:14:72:534:666:144:Times:144:Times:B:whom intimate knowledge of the small business, its owner and its local market gained over time
4:66:4428:14:15:72:535:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:through a relationship with the financial institution is important...these arguments do not suggest
4:67:4527:15:14:72:519:637:144:Times:144:Times:B:that large complex financial institutions created by consolidation would reduce services to all
4:68:4622:14:28:72:504:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:small customers, rather just to those customers who rely on relationships.”  (pp. 165-166.)
4:69:4713:28:28:108:498:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:On the one hand, this informal argument is quite clear in asserting that there exist
4:70:4797:28:29:72:532:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:“organizational diseconomies” which somehow prevent big banks from being the most efficient
4:71:4888:29:28:72:519:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:providers of certain information-intensive services, such as relationship-based small business
4:72:4982:28:28:72:523:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:lending.  On the other hand, it is vaguer as to what the root cause of these diseconomies might
4:73:5077:28:29:72:500:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:be.  For example, the suggestion that big banks simply  have trouble engaging in multiple
4:74:5166:29:28:72:537:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:activities that require different technologies (“different policies and procedures”) seems less than
4:75:5266:28:28:72:520:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:compelling.  After all, most big banks are involved in a wide range of technologically distinct
4:76:5361:28:29:72:442:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:activities, from check processing to credit cards to foreign-exchange trading. 
4:77:5440:29:28:108:489:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:So what is it about small-business lending–as opposed to various other banking
4:78:5518:28:28:72:504:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:activities–that might lead it to be an especially poor fit for a large banking firm?    In what
4:79:5613:28:29:72:535:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows, I argue that the key distinguishing characteristic of small-business lending in this regard
4:80:5713:29:28:72:509:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:is that it relies heavily on information that is “soft”–i.e., information that cannot be directly
4:81:5810:28:28:72:520:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:verified by anyone other than the agent who produces it.  For example, a loan officer who has
4:82:5903:28:29:72:500:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:worked with a small-company president may come to believe that the president is honest,
4:83:5990:29:28:72:513:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:prudent, and hardworking–in other words, the classic candidate for an unsecured  “character
4:84:6081:28:28:72:537:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan”.  Unfortunately, none of these attributes can be unambiguously documented in a report that
4:85:6177:28:28:72:503:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:the loan officer can pass on to his superiors.  This situation contrasts sharply with, e.g., an
4:86:6272:28:0:72:522:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:application for a  home mortgage loan.  Here the decision of whether or not to extend credit is
5:87:6367:0:19:108:530:162:52:Times:144:Times:A:2It is worth noting, however, that this divergence between mortgages and small-business
5:88:6454:19:14:72:521:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:loans may be shrinking over time.  Improvements in technology, the accompanying growth of
5:89:6543:14:14:72:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:“infomediaries” (such as Dun and Bradstreet), and more widespread adoption of credit-scoring
5:90:6635:14:14:72:521:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:models would appear to make it possible for an increasing amount of information about small
5:91:6726:14:0:72:492:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:businesses to be hardened.  See, e.g., Petersen and Rajan (2000) for a recent discussion.
5:92:6816:0:28:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to be made primarily based on “hard”, verifiable information, such as the income shown on
5:93:6912:28:28:72:262:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:the borrower’s last several tax returns.2 
5:94:6953:28:29:108:494:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:The model that is developed below has the feature that although decentralization
5:95:7033:29:28:72:523:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily has some disadvantages, it may on balance be a good method for allocating capital
5:96:7126:28:28:72:497:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:when the projects in question must–like small-business loans–be evaluated based on soft
5:97:7213:28:29:72:508:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:information.  The flip side is that large, hierarchical firms have a comparative advantage in
5:98:7306:29:28:72:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital allocation when information about projects can be hardened, as in the case of mortgage
5:99:7400:28:28:72:111:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:lending.
5:100:7408:28:29:108:539:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:With soft information, the fundamental advantage of decentralization is that it strengthens
5:101:7499:29:28:72:540:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:the research incentives of line managers.  Imagine a loan officer in Little Rock who is responsible
5:102:7598:28:28:72:513:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:for deciding which small-business loans are worth making.  The quality of the loan officer’s
5:103:7690:28:29:72:509:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:judgement will depend on how good a job he has done  in terms of information production,
5:104:7778:29:28:72:524:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:which in turn will be a function of  his incentives.  Under full decentralization, the Little Rock
5:105:7876:28:28:72:537:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:loan officer is also the CEO of the local bank, and as such has the authority to allocate the bank’s
5:106:7976:28:29:72:536:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds as he sees fit.  Given that he can count on having some capital to work with, he knows that
5:107:8073:29:28:72:512:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:his research efforts will not be wasted, and hence his incentives to do research are relatively
5:108:8168:28:28:72:527:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:strong.  Said differently, decentralization rewards an agent who develops expertise by ensuring
5:109:8263:28:29:72:484:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:that he will also have access to some capital which he can use to lever that expertise.  
5:110:8352:29:0:108:510:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:In contrast, if the Little Rock loan officer is part of a large multi-bank hierarchy, the
6:111:8442:0:28:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:following problem arises.  Suppose that he spends a lot of effort learning about prospects in his
6:112:8539:28:28:72:536:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:area.  But then somebody higher up in the organization decides that overall lending opportunities
6:113:8636:28:29:72:540:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:are better in Tulsa, and sharply cuts the capital allocation for Little Rock.  In this case, because he
6:114:8739:29:28:72:530:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:doesn’t get a chance to act on the information that he has produced (and because he is unable to
6:115:8835:28:28:72:513:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:credibly pass it on) the Little Rock loan officer’s research effort goes to waste.  Ex ante, this
6:116:8932:28:29:72:516:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:implies that the loan officer does less research in a hierarchical setting.  Here the authority to
6:117:9030:29:28:72:529:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocate capital is separated from expertise–i.e., the Little Rock loan officer may be left with no
6:118:9129:28:28:72:447:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital to work with–which tends to dilute the incentives to become an expert.
6:119:9207:28:29:108:538:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:So with soft information, the advantage of decentralization relative to hierarchy is higher-
6:120:9299:29:28:72:506:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:powered research incentives and hence better capital allocation within operating units (i.e.,
6:121:9392:28:28:72:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:within the Little Rock office).  Of course, there is also a countervailing cost.  By committing to a
6:122:9492:28:29:72:523:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed capital allocation for the Little Rock office, decentralization leads to inefficiencies when
6:123:9590:29:28:72:533:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:lending opportunities are unexpectedly weak in Little Rock and strong in Tulsa.  In other words,
6:124:9686:28:28:72:494:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization does not allow for efficient reallocations across operating units, while a
6:125:9777:28:29:72:495:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchical design does. Nevertheless, if  line-manager research is sufficiently valuable,
6:126:9868:29:28:72:425:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization may on net be the better design when information is soft.
6:127:9942:28:28:108:530:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:However, things work very differently when the information produced by line managers
6:128:10026:28:29:72:520:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:can be hardened and passed on to their superiors.  Now, not only does a hierarchy do better in
6:129:10120:29:28:72:530:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of moving money across operating units, it can also generate more research on the part of
6:130:10215:28:28:72:493:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:line managers than under decentralization.  This is because with hard information, these
6:131:10303:28:28:72:518:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers effectively become advocates for their units–if they can produce verifiable positive
6:132:10396:28:0:72:539:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:information and pass it on to their superiors, they can  increase the amount of capital that they are
7:133:10498:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocated.   Here, paradoxically, separating authority from expertise actually improves research
7:134:10594:28:28:72:538:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives, as line managers struggle to produce enough information to convince their bosses that
7:135:10691:28:29:72:388:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:they should get a larger share of the firm’s overall capital budget. 
7:136:10760:29:28:108:513:623:144:Times:144:Times:A:Beyond just saying that soft information favors small firms, the model also produces
7:137:10844:28:28:72:509:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:several other conclusions.  First, suppose that for some other exogenous reason, it becomes
7:138:10935:28:29:72:511:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal to have a relatively large integrated firm operating in a setting where information is
7:139:11029:29:28:72:518:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:soft–say because there are significant synergies across the firm’s different projects.  In such a
7:140:11126:28:28:72:538:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:case, holding the firm’s size and scope fixed, the softness of information will tend to imply that a
7:141:11226:28:29:72:475:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:flatter organizational structure, with fewer layers of management, is more attractive.
7:142:11312:29:28:108:520:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another implication is that hierarchies tend to be characterized by inefficient levels of
7:143:11401:28:28:72:488:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:bureaucracy.  This implication follows if one extends the model so that the hardness of
7:144:11488:28:29:72:533:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:information is not exogenously fixed.  For example, one might assume that by devoting effort to
7:145:11583:29:28:72:528:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:documentation and report-writing, a line manager can harden information that would otherwise
7:146:11675:28:28:72:536:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:be soft.  Because hard information is so (privately) valuable to line managers in a hierarchy, they
7:147:11774:28:29:72:534:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:will devote excessive efforts to such documentation activities.  Thus in this modified setting, the
7:148:11873:29:28:72:532:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs of a hierarchy do not necessarily take the form of  line managers simply being discouraged
7:149:11969:28:28:72:517:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:and slacking off, but instead may manifest themselves as line managers working very hard to
7:150:12060:28:29:72:532:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:generate the wrong kind of information.  In particular, there will be too much report-writing and
7:151:12157:29:28:72:265:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:not enough soft-information production.
7:152:12196:28:28:108:514:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:The ideas in this paper build on several earlier works.  I defer a full discussion of the
7:153:12285:28:29:72:505:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:related  literature until Section V, and only note here the most direct linkages. The capital-
7:154:12379:29:0:72:528:113:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation model itself is a direct extension of that in Stein (1997), with the new twist being the
8:155:12479:0:28:72:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:explicit consideration of line-manager research incentives.  In Stein (1997),  line managers are
8:156:12575:28:28:72:539:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:treated as passive robots who do not need to be motivated.  Rather, the focus is more narrowly on
8:157:12672:28:29:72:524:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO’s incentives to shift resources across the firm’s different operating units–an approach
8:158:12767:29:28:72:402:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:that naturally leads to a more favorable view of large organizations.  
8:159:12838:28:28:108:539:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:In arguing that line managers’ incentives may be blunted when they are in a hierarchy and
8:160:12927:28:29:72:507:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:thus do not have ultimate authority, I am following Aghion and Tirole (1997).  However, a
8:161:13016:29:28:72:515:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:critical distinction is that in the model of this paper, a hierarchical structure need not weaken
8:162:13113:28:28:71:533:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:line-manager incentives–indeed, it only does so when information is soft.  In contrast, in Aghion
8:163:13210:28:29:71:532:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Tirole (1997), it is a more general proposition that line managers are discouraged when they
8:164:13306:29:28:71:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not have full authority.  Thus the models have quite different empirical implications, as the
8:165:13402:28:28:71:531:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:example of the banking industry suggests: the Aghion-Tirole model does not say anything about
8:166:13495:28:29:71:519:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:why large hierarchies might be at more of a disadvantage with small-business loans than with
8:167:13587:29:28:71:195:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:credit cards or mortgages.
8:168:13613:28:28:71:529:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:         The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.  The basic model is developed in Section
8:169:13710:28:29:71:533:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:II.  Section III considers several extensions and variations.  In Section IV, I return to the banking
8:170:13811:29:28:71:533:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry, and review the relevant empirical evidence more fully in light of the theory.  Section V
8:171:13909:28:57:71:504:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:discusses the related theoretical literature on organizational design.  Section VI concludes.
8:172:14002:57:28:107:176:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:II.  The Model
8:173:14016:28:28:108:199:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:A.  Basic Structure
8:174:14035:28:28:108:524:142:144:Times:144:Times:A:The model considers a firm with two divisions, i and j.  Within each division, there are
8:175:14123:28:0:72:478:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:two potential investment projects.  The projects in division i are denoted by i1 and i2
9:176:14211:0:28:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:respectively, while those in division j are denoted by j1 and j2.  Each of the four projects can be
9:177:14310:28:28:72:522:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:operated at a variable scale; in particular, each project can be allocated either zero, one or two
9:178:14408:28:29:72:516:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:units of capital.  The firm faces an overall capital constraint, in that it only has a total of four
9:179:14508:29:28:72:256:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:units of capital that can be distributed.
9:180:14549:28:28:108:509:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:The capital constraint can be interpreted in one of two ways.  First, one can think of
9:181:14635:28:29:72:537:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:“capital” as simply cash that can be spent on the projects.  In this interpretation, the firm faces an
9:182:14737:29:28:72:517:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall liquidity constraint.  Although the roots of this liquidity constraint are not modeled in
9:183:14834:28:28:72:533:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:detail here, they can be easily endogenized, as is done by Stein (1997) in a very similar setting; I
9:184:14934:28:29:72:510:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:will elaborate on this point briefly below.  Alternatively, the “capital” might represent, e.g.,
9:185:15030:29:28:72:525:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:access to specialized production facilities.  That is,  the firm might have a fixed amount of  lab
9:186:15128:28:28:72:522:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:space–which, due to adjustment costs, cannot be increased in the short run–and it must decide
9:187:15221:28:29:72:290:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:how to allocate this lab space across projects.
9:188:15268:29:28:108:529:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:Each of the four projects can be in either a G (good) or B (bad) state.  The probability of
9:189:15359:28:28:72:537:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:each state is ½, and the outcomes are independent across projects.  A project that is in the G state
9:190:15459:28:29:72:527:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:yields a net output of g(1) if it gets one unit of capital, and g(2) if it gets two units.  Similarly, a
9:191:15563:29:28:72:534:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:project that is in the B state yields a net output of b(1) with one unit of capital, and b(2) with two
9:192:15665:28:28:72:531:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:units.   It is assumed throughout that g(2) < 2g(1), and b(2) < 2b(1); that is, there are decreasing
9:193:15765:28:29:72:527:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns in either state.  In addition, g(2) > g(1) + b(1), which means that if one has two units of
9:194:15864:29:28:72:511:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital along with a G project and a B project, it is better to give the G project both units, as
9:195:15961:28:28:72:531:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:opposed to dividing the capital up equally across the projects.  In other words, it makes sense to
9:196:16059:28:29:72:263:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:move capital from bad to good projects.
9:197:16098:29:0:108:526:113:144:Times:144:Times:A:Each of the two divisions has its own division manager.  The division managers are, by
10:198:16184:0:19:108:509:148:52:Times:144:Times:A:3Non-responsiveness to monetary incentives is a common–albeit extreme–modeling
10:199:16262:19:14:72:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:device in papers in this genre.  One way to generate it is to assume that agents are infinitely
10:200:16357:14:14:72:507:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:averse to risk in their monetary income (though not necessarily averse to variations in non-
10:201:16449:14:0:72:432:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:monetary private benefits).  See Aghion and Tirole (1997) for a discussion.
10:202:16525:0:28:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:virtue of research effort, able to learn about the signals of the projects that they oversee. 
10:203:16619:28:28:72:536:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:Specifically, if manager i makes an effort ei, he has a probability p(ei) of observing the signals on
10:204:16720:28:29:72:535:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:both of his projects, i1 and i2, where the function p( ) is increasing, concave, and takes on values
10:205:16820:29:28:72:525:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the interval [0, 1).  I assume that the division managers have reservation utilities of zero, so
10:206:16919:28:28:72:413:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:that there is never any issue of satisfying their participation constraints.
10:207:16995:28:29:108:529:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:The firm also has a CEO, who may in some circumstances undertake her own research. 
10:208:17078:29:28:72:537:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:The CEO’s research technology is described in detail below.  For the time being it suffices to say
10:209:17176:28:28:72:533:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:that, because the CEO is overseeing a total of four projects, she is unable to learn as much about
10:210:17274:28:29:72:531:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:each one individually as are the division managers.  Instead, the CEO is at best able to get noisy
10:211:17372:29:28:72:415:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:information about the aggregate prospects of each of the two divisions. 
10:212:17444:28:28:108:524:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:To model the incentives of the divisions managers and the CEO, I follow Stein (1997),
10:213:17529:28:29:72:527:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:and assume that each agent seeks to maximize the gross output from the assets under his or her
10:214:17623:29:28:72:538:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:control.  This assumption can in turn be motivated based on: i) private benefits of control that are
10:215:17723:28:28:72:539:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:proportional to gross output; and ii) non-responsiveness of agents to monetary incentives.3   It has
10:216:17823:28:29:72:494:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:the following behavioral implication: each agent always prefers more capital to less, but
10:217:17912:29:28:72:541:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditional on being granted a certain amount of capital, each agent tries to allocate it efficiently. 
10:218:18015:28:28:72:511:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:Or said differently, the agents in the model are empire builders, but holding the size of their
10:219:18110:28:29:72:305:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:empires fixed, they prefer them to be profitable. 
10:220:18160:29:50:108:510:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:Note that division managers’ empire-building preferences create an agency problem
11:221:18241:50:19:108:527:148:52:Times:144:Times:A:4If one makes b(2) small enough (note that b(2) can be negative, since it is a net return),
11:222:18332:19:14:72:518:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders will always prefer to give the firm four units of capital rather than five or more. 
11:223:18429:14:14:72:515:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:This is because if the firm has five or more units, there will necessarily be some states of the
11:224:18525:14:0:72:377:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:world when two units are invested in a B project, yielding b(2). 
11:225:18591:0:28:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:between them and the CEO.  For example, if manager i has better information about projects i1
11:226:18684:28:28:72:511:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:and i2 than the CEO, he will, if asked, always say that both projects are in the G state.  As a
11:227:18779:28:29:72:537:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:result, the CEO cannot trust the division managers to give accurate reports about the prospects of
11:228:18877:29:28:72:138:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:their projects.
11:229:18892:28:28:108:540:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:A similar agency problem exists between the CEO and the firm’s shareholders.  However,
11:230:18978:28:29:72:536:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:the effects of this problem are suppressed in the equilibria that I consider below.  This is because
11:231:19078:29:28:72:517:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:I assume throughout that the amount of capital that the CEO has to work with is fixed at four
11:232:19171:28:28:72:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:units, so her own empire-building preferences do not come into play.  Rather, given the capital
11:233:19266:28:29:72:513:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraint, her efforts to maximize her private benefits coincide perfectly with shareholders’
11:234:19360:29:28:72:297:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:objective of maximizing the firm’s net profits. 
11:235:19408:28:28:108:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:Of course, the fact that the CEO is capital-constrained in the first place may be a result of
11:236:19501:28:29:72:522:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:shareholders trying to check her empire-building tendencies.  This is precisely how the capital
11:237:19596:29:28:72:519:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraint is endogenously derived in Stein (1997), and a similar argument can be made here.
11:238:19688:28:28:72:506:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:Shareholders can never rely on the CEO to honestly reveal anything she might know about
11:239:19775:28:29:72:510:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:project prospects, since given her taste for more capital, she will always make an optimistic
11:240:19868:29:28:72:521:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:report.  Thus the best that shareholders can do is simply to give the firm a fixed, uncontingent
11:241:19964:28:28:72:524:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation of capital.  By choosing parameter values appropriately, it is easy to set things up so
11:242:20062:28:0:72:459:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the optimal ex ante allocation from shareholders’ perspective is four units.4  
12:243:20148:0:28:108:252:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:B.  The First-Best Benchmark
12:244:20176:28:28:108:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:As a benchmark for comparison, it is useful to compute the value of expected net output
12:245:20263:28:29:72:528:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:that is obtained in a idealized situation where a single planner has access to perfect information
12:246:20361:29:28:72:537:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:about all the projects.  This computation is straightforward: simply enumerate each of the sixteen
12:247:20459:28:28:72:530:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible outcomes (four projects, each of which can be in one of two states) and, any time there
12:248:20555:28:29:72:532:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:is a G project that can be paired with a B project, have the planner invest two units in the former
12:249:20654:29:56:72:433:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:and none in the latter.  The resulting net output, denoted by Yfb, is given by:
12:250:20733:56:57:108:518:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:Yfb = (5g(2) + 3b(1) + 3g(1))/4 (1)
12:251:20768:57:28:108:204:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:C.  Decentralization
12:252:20788:28:29:108:538:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:The first–and simplest–organizational form to be considered is “decentralization”.  Under
12:253:20877:29:28:72:538:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization, the CEO does no research of her own and does not attempt to get involved at all
12:254:20974:28:28:72:540:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the capital allocation process.  Rather, there is simply an unconditional, ex ante commitment to
12:255:21073:28:29:72:517:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:give each division manager two of the four units of capital to work with.  Manager i can then
12:256:21166:29:28:72:532:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocate his two units however he sees fit across projects i1 and i2, and similarly for manager j.  
12:257:21266:28:28:108:522:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:Given how spare the model is on other dimensions–with no operating synergies across
12:258:21349:28:29:72:511:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:any of the projects–decentralization is most naturally interpreted as dis-integration.  That is,
12:259:21445:29:28:72:501:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization corresponds to the divisions being split up into two separate firms run by
12:260:21536:28:28:72:526:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers i and j, with the CEO out of the picture.  Indeed, Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (1999)
12:261:21628:28:8:72:515:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:argue that a breakup of this sort is the only way to credibly commit that the CEO will not get
13:262:21722:8:19:108:491:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:5Aghion and Tirole (1997) adopt a different point of view, assuming that formal
13:263:21801:19:14:72:539:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:authority–including the right to make capital allocation decisions–can be irrevocably delegated to
13:264:21899:14:0:72:502:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers other than the CEO. This is an important distinction, and I will return to it later.
13:265:21994:0:28:72:280:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:involved in the capital allocation process.5  
13:266:22040:28:28:108:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:The costs of decentralization are easy to see.  Imagine that the signals for projects i1 and
13:267:22132:28:29:72:524:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:i2 are {G, G} while those for projects j1 and j2 are {B, B}.  In this case, the optimal thing to do
13:268:22231:29:28:72:469:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be to give all four units of capital to division i, but this cannot happen under
13:269:22317:28:28:72:524:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization.  In other words, decentralization precludes making value-enhancing transfers
13:270:22411:28:29:72:519:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:across divisions.  This can be thought of as a failure to effectively coordinate activities across
13:271:22509:29:28:71:117:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:divisions.
13:272:22519:28:28:107:525:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:On the other hand, decentralization may allow for relatively efficient allocations within
13:273:22608:28:29:72:530:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:divisions.  For if a division manager’s research is successful and he observes {G, B} for the two
13:274:22705:29:28:72:539:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:projects under his purview, he will do the right thing ex post and give both units of funding to the
13:275:22805:28:28:72:485:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:G project.  The only question is how much effort he will put into this research ex ante.
13:276:22893:28:29:108:525:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:To answer this question, note that if a division manager knows the states and can make
13:277:22979:29:28:72:527:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocations conditional on this knowledge, expected net output is  (g(2) + b(1) + g(1))/2.  If, on
13:278:23077:28:28:71:515:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:the other hand, the manager is uninformed, each project always gets one unit of funding, and
13:279:23169:28:29:71:513:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected net output is simply  g(1) + b(1).  Thus the expected output gain to being informed
13:280:23261:29:56:71:315:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:under decentralization, denoted by )d, is given by:
13:281:23312:56:57:107:518:227:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:A:)d = (g(2) - g(1) - b(1))/2(2)
13:282:23342:57:0:108:523:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:Assuming that the manager puts a weight of ( on expected net output relative to effort
14:283:23430:0:28:72:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i.e., his private benefits are a fraction ( of gross output and investment is exogenously fixed),
14:284:23528:28:28:72:499:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:his first-order conditions imply that the level of research effort under decentralization, ed,
14:285:23622:28:57:71:113:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:satisfies:
14:286:23632:57:28:107:527:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:pN(ed) = 1/()d    (3)
14:287:23652:28:29:108:530:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:With two independent divisions each behaving this way, the total net return (on the four
14:288:23740:29:56:72:335:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:units of capital) under decentralization, Yd, is given by:
14:289:23798:56:57:108:518:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:Yd =  p(ed)(g(2) + b(1) + g(1)) +    (1 - p(ed))(2g(1) + 2b(1))(4)
14:290:23864:57:28:108:535:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:From equation (4) it can be seen that decentralization involves two inefficiencies relative
14:291:23955:28:29:72:527:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the first-best outcome in equation (1).  First, the fact that research is costly implies that there
14:292:24057:29:28:72:507:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:will not always be full information about project prospects:  p(ed) <  1.  Second, even if we
14:293:24150:28:28:72:535:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach the limit where  p(ed) = 1, Yd  still only reaches (g(2) + b(1) + g(1)), which is less than 
14:294:24251:28:29:72:519:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:Yfb.  This is because under decentralization, resources cannot be moved across divisions, only
14:295:24345:29:56:72:154:283:144:Times:52:Times:B:within divisions. 
14:296:24362:56:29:108:316:227:144:Times:144:Times:A:D.  Hierarchy: the Case of Soft Information
14:297:24405:29:28:108:523:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:The next case to be considered is one in which there is soft information and the firm is
14:298:24493:28:28:72:530:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:organized as an integrated hierarchy, with the two division managers ceding formal authority to
14:299:24588:28:28:72:513:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO.  To make this case interesting, one needs to assume that the CEO can gather some
14:300:24677:28:0:72:536:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:information on her own.  If not, she can do no better than to always grant each division two units
15:301:24777:0:28:72:480:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:of funding, thereby reproducing the decentralized outcome.  In other words, with soft
15:302:24862:28:28:72:513:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:information, a CEO who does no research of her own may have formal authority, but (in the
15:303:24951:28:29:72:367:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:words of Aghion and Tirole (1997)) she has no real authority.
15:304:25012:29:28:108:516:623:144:Times:144:Times:A:While it is plausible that the CEO can learn something about investment prospects, it
15:305:25097:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be unreasonable to posit that she can learn as much in total as the two division managers. 
15:306:25194:28:29:72:538:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:Instead, I assume that the CEO can only get coarse information about the aggregated prospects of
15:307:25290:29:28:72:502:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:each division.  Specifically, there is a probability q that the CEO’s research efforts will be
15:308:25384:28:28:72:524:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:successful.  Successful research means that, if one or both divisions are “stars”–in the sense of
15:309:25481:28:29:72:533:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:having both of their projects in the G state simultaneously–this star status will be revealed to the
15:310:25581:29:28:72:530:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:CEO.   The coarseness of the CEO’s research technology is captured in the fact that, even if her
15:311:25677:28:28:72:538:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:research is successful, she can never differentiate between a division that is “average” (has one G
15:312:25776:28:29:72:404:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:and one B project) and a division that is a “dog” (has two B projects).
15:313:25847:29:28:108:528:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:A couple of points about this formulation deserve comment.  First, the CEO’s research-
15:314:25933:28:28:72:532:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:success probability q is for the time being an exogenous parameter.  In Section III, I will discuss
15:315:26032:28:29:72:521:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:what happens when q is made an endogenous function of the CEO’s effort.  Second, the exact
15:316:26122:29:28:72:495:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:way that I have modeled the coarseness of the CEO’s information is not critical.  I could
15:317:26211:28:28:72:534:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:equivalently assume that successful research allows the CEO only to identify  dog divisions, and
15:318:26307:28:29:72:534:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:that she can never distinguish between average divisions and stars; this leads to the same results.
15:319:26406:29:28:108:490:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:Capital allocation in a hierarchy works as follows.  When the CEO’s research is
15:320:26485:28:0:72:511:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:unsuccessful (which happens with probability (1-q)), the best she can do is to just give each
16:321:26578:0:19:108:511:190:52:Times:144:Times:A:6I do not consider the possibility that the CEO might use her information as part of a
16:322:26664:19:14:72:534:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanism to induce division managers to reveal their own signals.  One could imagine that if a
16:323:26759:14:14:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager lies about his division being a star, and the CEO subsequently catches him, he would be
16:324:26854:14:14:72:530:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:punished with a reduced capital allocation, as in Harris and Raviv (1996).   In my set-up, such a
16:325:26951:14:14:72:516:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:scheme suffers from two distinct commitment problems.  First, punishment involves ex-post
16:326:27040:14:14:72:533:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:inefficient capital allocations.  And second, if in equilibrium the division managers do truthfully
16:327:27139:14:0:72:494:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:reveal their signals, the CEO will no longer have any incentive to do her own research.  
16:328:27230:0:28:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:division manager two units of funding, and we are back to the decentralized outcome.6  When the
16:329:27325:28:28:72:539:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:CEO’s research is successful (which happens with probability q), she may choose to deviate from
16:330:27420:28:29:72:530:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal funding, and give one division more than the other.  This will only happen if one division
16:331:27516:29:28:72:512:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:is identified as a star, and the other is not.  In such a “lone-star” scenario, the CEO has three
16:332:27613:28:28:72:529:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:options: 1) continue to give each division two units; 2) give the star division three units and the
16:333:27712:28:29:72:534:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:other division one unit; or 3) give the star division all four units.  It is easy to show that the CEO
16:334:27814:29:28:72:529:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:will choose the most extreme tilting of the capital budget–giving all four units of funding to the
16:335:27912:28:57:72:344:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:star division–if the following sufficient condition is met:
16:336:27971:57:56:108:518:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:g(2)/2 > (5g(1) +  b(1))/6(5)
16:337:28000:56:29:108:531:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:This condition simply requires that decreasing returns to scale are not too pronounced in
16:338:28089:29:28:72:509:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:the good state.  The analysis that follows is most transparent when this star-gets-everything
16:339:28182:28:28:72:521:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:condition is satisfied, so I will begin by assuming that it is. Later, I will come back to the case
16:340:28281:28:29:72:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:where returns decrease more sharply with scale, so that the CEO gives just three, rather than four
16:341:28379:29:28:72:360:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:units of funding to a division that is identified as a lone star.
16:342:28444:28:28:108:525:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:If division managers’ ex ante research incentives in a hierarchy were the same as under
16:343:28531:28:39:72:473:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization, it would follow immediately that hierarchy is the strictly dominant
17:344:28616:39:19:108:521:188:52:Times:144:Times:A:7Note that the negative incentive effect that comes from sometimes losing two units of
17:345:28702:19:14:72:520:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:funding is not offset by the fact that the division manager also sometimes gets two extra units
17:346:28797:14:14:72:534:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:(four units in total) of funding in a hierarchy.  When he receives four units, the only thing he can
17:347:28897:14:21:72:479:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:do is invest two in each of his projects, and his information is again not of any value.
17:348:28985:21:19:108:525:120:52:Times:144:Times:A:8Indeed, the discouragement effect occurs precisely because an “average” division (i.e.,
17:349:29073:19:0:72:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:one with one G and one B project) can lose all its funding based not on its own prospects, but
17:350:29169:0:28:72:484:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizational form.   This is because ex post, hierarchy allows for a form of selective
17:351:29257:28:28:72:526:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:intervention.  When the CEO knows nothing about divisional prospects, she does not interfere,
17:352:29350:28:29:72:536:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the outcome is the same as with decentralization.  When the CEO does know something, her
17:353:29442:29:28:72:512:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:ability to shift funds towards a star division leads to an improved across-division allocation.
17:354:29537:28:28:108:533:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:The problem, however, is that division managers’ ex ante research incentives are weaker
17:355:29624:28:29:72:528:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:in a hierarchy when information is soft.  To see why, suppose that the CEO’s research has been
17:356:29718:29:28:72:531:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:successful, and that she has identified division j as a star.  Division i, meanwhile, has one G and
17:357:29817:28:28:72:540:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:one B project.  In a hierarchy, division j gets all four units of funding, and division i gets nothing. 
17:358:29921:28:29:72:532:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence any information that manager i has acquired is not put to use.  In contrast, if the divisions
17:359:30020:29:28:72:510:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:were decentralized, and manager i had two units of funding to work with, he would find his
17:360:30110:28:28:72:512:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:information valuable–it would lead him to shift both units to his single G project.   Thus the
17:361:30204:28:29:72:508:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:downside to a hierarchy is that because the CEO sometimes takes away manager i’s capital
17:362:30292:29:28:72:534:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:budget, the marginal return to his research efforts is reduced, and he produces less information.7 
17:363:30390:28:28:108:509:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:It is important to recognize that the negative incentive effects of  hierarchy arise not
17:364:30478:28:29:72:506:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:simply because the CEO sometimes has her own independent information about divisional
17:365:30563:29:28:72:521:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:investment opportunities.  It is also crucial to the argument that the CEO have the authority to
17:366:30659:28:28:72:528:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:take away all funding from division i–even though i might be able to raise two units if it were a
17:367:30756:28:126:72:532:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:stand-alone entity–when her research indicates that division j is a star.8  As emphasized by Stein
18:368:30854:126:0:72:481:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather because the prospects of its counterpart division within the firm are so strong.  
18:369:30945:0:28:72:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1997), it is this authority that distinguishes a CEO from, e.g., a well-informed banker.  Thus
18:370:31040:28:28:72:509:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:what I am calling a “hierarchy” cannot be equivalently thought of as two independent firms
18:371:31130:28:29:72:359:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:facing a single well-informed external supplier of capital.    
18:372:31193:29:28:108:527:623:144:Times:144:Times:A:To formalize things, denote by )hs the gain in expected net output that arises when, in a
18:373:31282:28:28:72:501:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy with soft information, a division manager’s research efforts are successful.  It is
18:374:31375:28:57:72:211:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:straightforward to show that:
18:375:31404:57:57:107:518:510:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:A:)hs = (1 - q)(g(2) - g(1) - b(1))/2 + 3q(g(2) - g(1) - b(1))/8 = (1 -q))d + 3q)d/4(6)
18:376:31488:57:56:72:480:453:144:Times:144:Times:B: The  level of research effort in a hierarchy with soft information, ehs, satisfies:
18:377:31571:56:57:108:527:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:pN(ehs) = 1/()hs      (7)
18:378:31595:57:28:108:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:Since )hs  < )d, it follows that ehs < ed.   By working through all the possible outcomes, it
18:379:31687:28:57:72:533:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:can then be established that expected net output in a hierarchy with soft information is given by:
18:380:31785:57:28:108:434:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:Yhs = (1 - q){p(ehs)(g(2) + b(1) + g(1)) +  (1 - p(ehs))(2g(1) + 2b(1))}
18:381:31857:28:57:108:518:227:144:Times:144:Times:A:+  q{p(ehs)(6g(2) + 3b(1) + g(1))/4 +  (1 - p(ehs))(3g(2) + 6b(1) + 4g(1))/4}(8)
18:382:31937:57:28:108:484:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:By comparing equations (8) and (4), one can evaluate the relative efficiency of
18:383:32016:28:0:72:476:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization versus hierarchy.   The results to this point can be summarized as:   
19:384:32105:0:28:108:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 1: Assume that the condition in (5) holds, g(2)/2 > (5g(1) +  b(1))/6, so that
19:385:32195:28:28:72:537:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:in a hierarchy, a lone-star division gets four units of funding.  Then decentralization always leads
19:386:32295:28:29:72:491:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:to more research effort than hierarchy: ed  >  ehs.   In addition, it  is possible (though not
19:387:32388:29:56:71:537:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessary) that decentralization leads to higher expected output than hierarchy; i.e., that Yd  > Yhs.
19:388:32489:56:29:108:508:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:To see why decentralization can generate higher expected output, consider a simple
19:389:32571:29:28:72:521:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:limiting case where q = 1,  p(ed) = 1, and p(ehs) = 0.  (The latter two conditions can always be
19:390:32667:28:28:72:528:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:generated by picking the proper form for the p( ) function.)  In this case, equation (4) simplifies
19:391:32766:28:29:71:510:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:to Yd =  g(2) + b(1) + g(1), while equation (8) simplifies to Yhs = (3g(2) + 6b(1) + 4g(1))/4,
19:392:32860:29:28:72:531:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:implying that Yd  > Yhs.   What is going on here is that when the firm is organized as a hierarchy,
19:393:32959:28:28:72:534:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:only the CEO does any research, and the division managers are totally discouraged.  Conversely,
19:394:33054:28:29:72:498:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:under decentralization, the division managers are highly motivated and become perfectly
19:395:33141:29:28:72:531:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:informed.  Given that the two division managers taken together are able to gather more accurate
19:396:33236:28:28:72:507:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:information than the CEO, this latter effect is more than enough to outweigh any improved
19:397:33325:28:29:72:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:across-division allocation that can be obtained in a hierarchy.   As a result, decentralization is the
19:398:33427:29:28:72:208:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:better mode of organization.
19:399:33455:28:28:108:501:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:Of course, this example relies on  p(ed) and p(ehs) being relatively far apart–i.e., on
19:400:33542:28:29:72:530:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:division-manager effort being both important, and responsive to incentives.  If  p(ed) and p(ehs)  
19:401:33640:29:28:72:529:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:are sufficiently close to one another, it is easy to see that hierarchy becomes more efficient than
19:402:33739:28:28:72:197:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization: Yhs  > Yd.
19:403:33767:28:28:108:537:142:144:Times:144:Times:A:Although I have, for the sake of expositional simplicity, derived the results in Proposition
19:404:33859:28:0:72:532:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:1 under the assumption that the star-gets-everything condition in (5) holds, they are in fact more
20:405:33959:0:28:72:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:general.  Even when returns to scale are more sharply decreasing in the good state–so that a lone-
20:406:34057:28:28:72:534:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:star division gets three, rather than four units of funding–the basic intuition can carry over.  That
20:407:34158:28:29:72:533:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:is, when manager i generates information and gets allocated only one unit of financing, (because
20:408:34254:29:28:72:524:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager j has been deemed a star by the CEO) manager i’s information is not worthless, but it
20:409:34347:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:may still be less valuable than if he had been allocated two units of financing.  Thus the threat of
20:410:34447:28:29:72:495:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:losing some–if not all–of their funding can continue to exert a chilling effect on division
20:411:34538:29:28:72:219:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers’ research incentives.
20:412:34568:28:57:108:418:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:To make this idea precise, in the appendix I prove the following:
20:413:34633:57:28:108:500:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 2: Assume that  g(2)/2  > (3g(1) +  b(1))/4.  In this case, the CEO in a
20:414:34717:28:28:72:509:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy will still tilt the capital budget toward a lone-star division, but the tilt may be less
20:415:34815:28:29:72:508:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:extreme, with the lone star receiving three, rather than four units of funding.  Nevertheless,
20:416:34909:29:28:72:530:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization continues to lead to more research effort than hierarchy: ed  >  ehs.   In addition,
20:417:35009:28:28:72:524:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:it  is possible (though not necessary) that decentralization leads to higher expected output than
20:418:35106:28:57:72:207:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy; i.e., that Yd  > Yhs.
20:419:35137:57:28:108:319:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:E.  Hierarchy: the Case of Hard Information
20:420:35180:28:29:108:522:227:144:Times:144:Times:A:The relative merits of a hierarchy increase when the information generated by division
20:421:35266:29:28:72:534:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers can be hardened and passed along to the CEO.  To introduce hard information, I begin
20:422:35359:28:28:72:525:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:by assuming that the division managers have the same research technology as before–that is, if
20:423:35453:28:28:72:516:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager i makes an effort ei, he has a probability p(ei) of observing the signals on both of his
20:424:35549:28:0:72:529:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:projects, i1 and i2.  Now, however, the CEO does no separate research of her own.  Instead, if a
21:425:35645:0:19:108:504:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:9This issue does not arise if one takes the alternative interpretation that the “capital
21:426:35733:19:14:72:528:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:constraint” represents a shortage of some specialized physical asset (e.g., production facilities),
21:427:35832:14:0:72:389:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather than an inability to raise more cash from outside investors.  
21:428:35903:0:28:72:478:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:division manager  learns something, there is a chance that he may be able to credibly
21:429:35988:28:28:72:522:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:communicate it to the CEO.   Specifically, conditional on a division manager’s research being
21:430:36081:28:29:72:504:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:successful and yielding information about his two projects, there is a probability z that this
21:431:36175:29:28:72:516:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:information is verifiable, and can be shown directly to the CEO.  With probability (1 - z), the
21:432:36270:28:28:72:493:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:information is non-verifiable, and can be used by the division manager, but not credibly
21:433:36358:28:29:72:186:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:transmitted to the CEO.
21:434:36381:29:28:108:539:538:144:Times:144:Times:A:None of the results that follow depend on the particular value of z–anything in the interval
21:435:36473:28:28:72:538:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:(0, 1] works fine.  Thus one could in principle economize on notation by setting z = 1.  However,
21:436:36570:28:29:72:514:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:I allow for z < 1 because it leads to a richer and more natural interpretation of the role of the
21:437:36667:29:28:72:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:division managers.  When z < 1, there continue to be times when the information remains soft
21:438:36759:28:28:72:539:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:and a division manager knows more than he can ever communicate to the CEO.   Thus the role of
21:439:36852:28:29:72:538:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:the division manager goes beyond simply making reports to the CEO and then passively awaiting
21:440:36945:29:28:72:514:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:his capital allocation–there are times when he can add further value by choosing how to best
21:441:37037:28:28:72:170:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:spend his allocation.
21:442:37058:28:29:108:485:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:Note that I am implicitly assuming that while hard information can be credibly
21:443:37136:29:28:72:538:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:transmitted from division managers to the CEO, it cannot be transmitted to outside shareholders. 
21:444:37233:28:28:72:538:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:For if such information could be shown directly to outside shareholders, it would no longer make
21:445:37329:28:29:72:520:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:sense to specify that the firm faces a fixed, uncontingent liquidity constraint.  Rather, in cases
21:446:37427:29:28:72:514:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:where a lot of positive information could be shown to shareholders, they might be willing to
21:447:37519:28:0:72:267:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:invest more than four units in the firm.9  
22:448:37562:0:19:108:527:202:52:Times:144:Times:A:10Under this interpretation, the  parameter z can be thought of as reflecting the ability or
22:449:37654:19:14:72:503:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:effort of the CEO–a higher value of z means that the CEO can better evaluate the raw data
22:450:37743:14:14:72:515:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:produced by the division managers.  As will be made clear below, when information is hard,
22:451:37833:14:21:72:511:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:CEO and division-manager effort become strategic complements, as opposed to substitutes.
22:452:37921:21:19:108:500:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:11Of course, as in any agency model, I have been assuming all along that division-
22:453:38003:19:14:72:508:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager research effort is non-contractible–i.e., cannot be verified in court.  However, it is
22:454:38097:14:0:72:376:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:stronger to assume that it cannot even be observed by the CEO.
22:455:38161:0:28:108:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:What does it mean to assume that there is a type of  information that can be transmitted to
22:456:38252:28:28:72:513:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO but not to shareholders?   Think of division managers as providing the CEO with a
22:457:38341:28:29:72:535:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:variety of raw, albeit well-documented data about a project.  For example, if the project involves
22:458:38439:29:28:72:533:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:drilling for oil in a new location, the raw data might be a set of geological studies. This raw data
22:459:38539:28:28:72:512:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not literally say what the project’s dollar payoff  will be.  Instead, the raw data must be
22:460:38635:28:29:72:538:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:combined with the CEO’s effort and expertise (e.g., her knowledge of geology, her assessment of
22:461:38730:29:28:72:514:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:the costs of doing the drilling and extraction, etc.) to generate a final judgement about dollar
22:462:38826:28:28:72:531:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:value.  The CEO’s final judgement–what she concludes after studying the raw data–is itself soft
22:463:38921:28:29:72:478:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:information that cannot be credibly communicated to non-expert outside investors.10 
22:464:39004:29:28:108:503:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another crucial assumption is that the CEO does not observe the level of division-
22:465:39086:28:28:72:516:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager research effort, nor can she tell whether or not this research has been successful.11   
22:466:39182:28:29:72:525:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently, when a division manager has hard information, he can choose whether or not to
22:467:39273:29:28:72:505:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:report it to the CEO.    In particular, a division manager who gets hard information that his
22:468:39366:28:28:72:480:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:projects are {B, B} may opt to simply keep quiet.  Importantly, this will not lead to an
22:469:39454:28:29:72:531:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:“unraveling” situation where the CEO can infer that the state must be {B, B} simply because the
22:470:39549:29:28:72:529:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:division manager is quiet.  This is because the division manager may also be quiet as a result of
22:471:39646:28:0:72:355:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:not having obtained any hard information in the first place.
23:472:39708:0:28:108:493:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:The option to keep quiet when hard information is negative makes research very
23:473:39786:28:28:72:524:680:144:Times:52:Times:B:attractive to the division manager.  To see why, assume that the CEO has a fixed conjecture eic
23:474:39881:28:29:72:524:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:about the level of effort that manager i exerts, and a corresponding conjecture pc = p(eic) about
23:475:39978:29:28:71:495:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:the probability that his research is successful.   Now suppose that the division manager’s
23:476:40068:28:28:71:536:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:reporting strategy is to reveal his hard information to the CEO when it is either {G, G} or {G, B},
23:477:40167:28:29:71:519:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:but to keep quiet when it is {B, B}.  (As will be seen below, this reporting strategy constitutes
23:478:40264:29:28:71:502:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:equilibrium behavior.)   Bayes’ rule implies that, given his conjecture of  pc, the CEO will
23:479:40356:28:57:71:194:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpret quiet as follows:
23:480:40383:57:28:107:521:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:prob({B, B}/quiet) = 1/(4 - 3zpc)(9) 
23:481:40420:28:28:108:526:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:prob({G, G}/quiet) = (1 - zpc)/(4 - 3zpc)(10) 
23:482:40466:28:57:107:527:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:prob({G, B}/quiet) = 2(1 - zpc)/(4 - 3zpc)(11) 
23:483:40513:57:28:108:523:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:Taking the CEO’s conjecture of  pc as fixed, a division manager frames the problem as
23:484:40598:28:29:72:508:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows.  If he does no research, he will certainly be quiet, and the CEO will update on him
23:485:40690:29:28:72:520:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:according to equations (9)-(11).  However, if he does devote some effort to research, he gains
23:486:40784:28:28:72:532:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:pure option value.  If the research produces hard information that his division is either {G, G} or
23:487:40883:28:29:72:539:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:{G, B}, he can speak up and thereby impress the CEO.   If the research produces hard information
23:488:40979:29:28:72:538:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:that his division is {B, B}, he just keeps quiet and is no worse off than if he had done no research.
23:489:41080:28:28:108:516:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:The bottom line is that, from the perspective of the division manager, there is now an
23:490:41166:28:28:72:528:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:added benefit to doing research: if the information he generates is hard and positive, it can help
23:491:41264:28:0:72:499:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase his capital budget and hence his private benefits.  This contrasts with both of the
24:492:41356:0:19:108:541:162:52:Times:144:Times:A:12There are other equilibria that differ insignificantly from that described in Proposition 3. 
24:493:41451:19:14:72:525:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:When one division reveals {G, G} and the other reveals {G, B}, the CEO is actually indifferent
24:494:41545:14:14:71:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:between allocating two units to each, or three to the former and one to the latter.  I focus on the
24:495:41644:14:14:71:533:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:two-two allocation in the proposition (which implies that a manager with a {G, B} signal strictly
24:496:41741:14:0:71:496:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:prefers to reveal it).  However, parts (iii) and (iv) of the proposition apply in either case. 
24:497:41838:0:28:71:492:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous scenarios–decentralization and hierarchy with soft information–where division
24:498:41924:28:28:71:438:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers’ research efforts had no impact on the capital they were allocated. 
24:499:42001:28:29:107:539:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the appendix, I provide a detailed characterization of  the case when information can be
24:500:42092:29:56:71:348:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:hardened.  The key results can be summarized as follows:
24:501:42148:56:29:107:520:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 3: Assume that  g(2)/2  > (3g(1) +  b(1))/4.  Then in a hierarchy with hard
24:502:42235:29:28:72:389:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:information, there is an equilibrium with the following properties:
24:503:42302:28:28:108:539:510:144:Times:144:Times:A:i)  Division manager reporting strategies: Division managers reveal their hard information
24:504:42392:28:29:72:356:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:if it is either {G, G} or {G, B}, and keep quiet if it is {B, B}.
24:505:42457:29:28:108:529:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:ii)  CEO capital-allocation policy: If the CEO is facing one division that reveals itself to
24:506:42549:28:28:72:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:be {G, G} and one that is quiet, the {G, G} division gets at least three (and possibly four) units of
24:507:42650:28:29:72:451:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital.  In all other cases, the CEO allocates each division two units of capital.
24:508:42733:29:28:108:518:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:iii)  Division manager benefit from being informed: Denote by )hh the expected gross
24:509:42817:28:28:72:518:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:output gain to a division manager from being informed in a hierarchy with hard information. 
24:510:42909:28:29:72:468:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:This output gain significantly exceeds that under decentralization: )hh > )d + z/4. 
24:511:42991:29:28:72:535:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently, division-manager research effort is greater than under decentralization:  ehh  >  ed .
24:512:43090:28:57:107:490:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:iv) Output: Expected net output is greater than under decentralization: Yhh  > Yd.
24:513:43171:57:0:107:539:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:The intuition behind parts (i) and (ii) of the proposition has already been discussed.12  Part
25:514:43267:0:28:72:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(iii) gives a quantitative sense for just how much stronger division managers’ research incentives
25:515:43365:28:28:72:496:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:are when information can be hardened.  The expected output gain to being informed in a
25:516:43451:28:29:72:531:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy, )hh, is now not just larger than that under decentralization )d; it exceeds it by at least
25:517:43552:29:28:72:513:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:z/4 .  This is a very substantial difference, since )d is effectively denominated in units of net
25:518:43649:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:return differentials, while z/4 is in units of gross capital.  To take a concrete example, reasonable
25:519:43750:28:29:72:509:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:values of b(1), g(1) and g(2) might be 0.05, 0.10 and 0.19 respectively.  In other words, one
25:520:43843:29:28:72:528:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:dollar invested in a B project yields a net present value (after all discounting) of five cents, etc. 
25:521:43945:28:28:72:530:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:For these values, equation (2) says that )d = 0.02.   But then if z is anywhere near one, then  z/4
25:522:44044:28:29:72:532:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:is on the order of ten times the size of )d .  Even for much smaller values of z, it will still be the
25:523:44146:29:28:72:247:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:case that z/4 is much larger than )d .
25:524:44184:28:28:108:534:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:This all just reflects the fact that in a hierarchy with hard information, research effort can
25:525:44278:28:29:72:531:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:actually influence a division manager’s gross capital budget.  In contrast, under decentralization
25:526:44376:29:28:72:531:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:(or in a hierarchy with soft information) research effort only enables a division manager to get a
25:527:44474:28:28:72:534:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher return from a given capital budget.  To the extent that division managers’ private benefits
25:528:44572:28:29:72:509:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:are proportional to gross output, the former effect is naturally much stronger than the latter.
25:529:44667:29:28:108:537:283:144:Times:144:Times:A:Part (iv) of the proposition–regarding expected net output–follows immediately from part
25:530:44755:28:28:72:531:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:(iii).  Now a hierarchy does better than decentralization on both dimensions of importance.  Not
25:531:44851:28:29:72:528:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:only does it generate more information at the division-manager level, and thereby lead to better
25:532:44947:29:28:72:522:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:within-division allocations, but it also allows for reallocations across divisions when the CEO
25:533:45042:28:28:72:319:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:learns that such reallocations are value-increasing.  
25:534:45096:28:28:108:494:142:144:Times:144:Times:A:One might argue that the results in Proposition 3 in favor of hierarchy relative to
25:535:45179:28:0:72:472:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization are now “too strong”–once information can be hardened, hierarchy
26:536:45262:0:28:72:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:unambiguously dominates decentralization for all parameter values, which seems unrealistic. 
26:537:45354:28:28:72:512:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:Certainly the model omits a number of other factors that might tip the balance back towards
26:538:45445:28:29:72:504:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization.  For example, other than research effort, the model assumes that division
26:539:45536:29:28:72:525:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers do not need to take any other actions.  If one were to introduce another dimension of
26:540:45630:28:28:72:532:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-contractible firm-specific investment, this might (following the logic of Grossman and Hart
26:541:45725:28:29:72:528:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1986), Hart and Moore (1990), and Hart (1995)) be expected to make hierarchy less attractive.
26:542:45819:29:28:108:502:538:144:Times:144:Times:A:But it is important to emphasize that I am much less interested in making absolute
26:543:45901:28:28:72:528:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:unconditional statements about the virtues of hierarchy compared to decentralization, and more
26:544:45995:28:29:72:500:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:interested in making comparative-statics statements about the circumstances under which
26:545:46082:29:28:72:523:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy is more likely to be attractive.  And the key result in this regard–that hierarchy looks
26:546:46180:28:28:72:494:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:better when information is hard, as opposed to soft–seems like it should be robust to the
26:547:46269:28:57:72:306:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of various other factors into the model.
26:548:46319:57:28:108:195:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:III.  Further Issues
26:549:46339:28:29:108:355:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:A.  Does Decentralization Require Dis-Integration?
26:550:46389:29:28:108:540:283:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the preceding discussion, I have been treating the concept of decentralization as loosely
26:551:46481:28:28:72:509:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:synonymous with dis-integration, i.e., with the two divisions being spun off as independent
26:552:46572:28:29:72:534:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:stand-alone entities.  Given how minimalist the model is on other dimensions–with no operating
26:553:46666:29:28:72:533:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:synergies across the two divisions–this interpretation seems uncontroversial.  However, a harder
26:554:46762:28:28:72:518:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:question arises if there are significant synergies, which would be lost in a breakup.  Then one
26:555:46857:28:28:72:468:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:must ask whether it is possible to capture the benefits of decentralization in capital
26:556:46943:28:0:72:498:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation–i.e., to commit to division managers that they will always receive two units of
27:557:47035:0:28:72:236:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:funding–without a costly breakup.
27:558:47068:28:28:108:540:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:Different authors have adopted different perspectives on this question.  Aghion and Tirole
27:559:47158:28:29:72:537:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1997) assume that formal authority over certain decision rights can be contractually delegated to
27:560:47256:29:28:72:492:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers in the organization other than the CEO.  In the context of the model here, this
27:561:47344:28:28:72:521:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumption would correspond to the idea that the CEO can indeed be contractually prohibited
27:562:47435:28:29:72:519:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:from getting involved in the capital allocation process.  Clearly, if this is the case, and if such
27:563:47534:29:28:72:515:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:delegation does not interfere with the CEO’s ability do carry out other aspects of her job, the
27:564:47629:28:28:72:500:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits of decentralization can be obtained even in the context of a large integrated firm.
27:565:47721:28:29:108:504:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (1999) take the opposite position, arguing that formal
27:566:47801:29:28:72:522:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:authority over all decisions necessarily resides at the top of an organization.  In other words, a
27:567:47899:28:28:72:538:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:CEO cannot irrevocably contract away her right to get involved in any decision.  If this is a better
27:568:47999:28:29:72:505:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:description of reality, then there are limits to how far one can go towards the decentralized
27:569:48092:29:28:72:521:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome without a breakup.  Certainly, there are other devices short of a breakup that one can
27:570:48186:28:28:72:522:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:employ to reduce the CEO’s ex post incentive to get involved; in this vein, Aghion and Tirole
27:571:48279:28:29:72:526:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1997) suggest putting the CEO in a situation of “overload”, so that she is too busy to do much
27:572:48374:29:28:72:479:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:research on her own.  And Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (1999) emphasize the role of
27:573:48454:28:28:72:524:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:reputation–in a repeated-game setting, the CEO may try to develop a reputation for being non-
27:574:48547:28:29:72:538:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:interventionist.  But while these devices may be able to improve division managers’ incentives to
27:575:48644:29:28:72:534:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:a degree, they will not in general have as strong an effect as a binding commitment that prevents
27:576:48741:28:28:72:391:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO from altering the capital budget under any circumstances.
27:577:48806:28:29:108:533:142:144:Times:144:Times:A:A middle-ground view might be that even if Aghion and Tirole (1997) are right, and it is
27:578:48894:29:0:72:509:113:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible for the CEO to formally divest some types of decision rights, (e.g., the right to fire
28:579:48989:0:19:108:529:148:52:Times:144:Times:A:13Once one takes account of other factors, it is hard to imagine that the CEO would ever
28:580:49077:19:14:72:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:want to divest this particular right, even if she legally could.  For example, given incomplete
28:581:49172:14:14:72:523:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:contracting, it might be difficult for the CEO to surgically excise just her right to move capital
28:582:49270:14:0:72:445:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:around without interfering with her ability to conduct other aspects of her job.
28:583:49352:0:28:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:certain workers without establishing just cause) it is unlikely that she can cede the specific right
28:584:49452:28:28:72:531:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:that is of interest here, the right to make high-level capital allocation decisions.13  Indeed, others
28:585:49554:28:29:72:515:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Williamson (1975), Donaldson (1984), Stein (1997) and Scharfstein and Stein (2000)) have
28:586:49643:29:28:72:511:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:argued that the CEO’s authority to move capital across divisions is the single most defining
28:587:49735:28:28:72:240:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristic of an integrated firm.
28:588:49772:28:29:108:513:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:If this view is correct, it leads to the following qualitative conclusions.  Suppose that
28:589:49861:29:28:72:520:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:based purely on division-manager research incentives, an analysis such as that in Section II.D
28:590:49955:28:28:72:524:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:cuts in favor of decentralization.  Suppose further that the other, non-capital-allocation-related
28:591:50053:28:29:72:510:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:synergies from integration are given by X.  When X is relatively small, it will make sense to
28:592:50146:29:28:72:526:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralize “to the max” by breaking up the firm.  However, when X is relatively large, it may
28:593:50241:28:28:72:518:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:be better to preserve X  by  keeping the firm integrated, but at the same time to do as much as
28:594:50336:28:29:72:523:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible with various internal devices (reputation, overload, etc.) to mimic–even if one cannot
28:595:50431:29:56:72:488:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:fully replicate–the decentralized outcome in terms of division-manager incentives.       
28:596:50520:56:29:108:500:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:B.  CEO Research Incentives: Why Soft Information Favors Flatter Organizations
28:597:50598:29:28:108:527:283:144:Times:144:Times:A:In modeling a hierarchy with soft information, I have thus far taken as exogenous q, the
28:598:50686:28:28:72:511:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability that the CEO’s research will be successful.  Now I ask what happens in the soft-
28:599:50778:28:29:72:528:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:information case when the CEO’s incentives are also taken into account–i.e., when q = q(eCEO),
28:600:50872:29:93:72:525:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:where  eCEO is the research effort exerted by the CEO, and where q( ), like p( ), is an increasing
29:601:50970:93:0:108:429:105:52:Times:144:Times:A:14The model of Aghion and Tirole (1997) produces a similar result.
29:602:51038:0:28:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:concave function.  For simplicity, I stick to the case where the star-gets-everything condition in
29:603:51136:28:28:72:143:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:(5) is satisfied.
29:604:51153:28:29:108:531:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:Denote by )CEO the expected gain in net output that arises when, in a hierarchy with soft
29:605:51242:29:28:72:501:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:information, the CEO’s research effort is successful.  This quantity is easily calculated by
29:606:51334:28:57:72:460:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:evaluating Yhs in equation (8) for both q = 1 and q = 0, and taking the difference:
29:607:51417:57:56:107:524:538:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:A:)CEO = p(ehs)(2g(2) - b(1) - 3g(1))/4 +  (1 - p(ehs))(3g(2) - 2b(1) - 4g(1))/4(12)
29:608:51499:56:29:108:531:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:An immediate consequence of equation (12) is that the CEO’s research is more valuable
29:609:51584:29:28:72:534:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:when division managers do less research–i.e., when p(ehs) is low.  Specifically, differentiation of
29:610:51683:28:57:72:127:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:(12) yields:
29:611:51695:57:56:108:524:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:d)CEO/ dp(ehs) = b(1) + g(1) - g(2) < 0(13)
29:612:51738:56:29:108:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:It then follows from the CEO’s first-order conditions that deCEO/ dehs < 0 also:  the CEO’s
29:613:51829:29:28:72:531:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:research effort is reduced when the division managers are working hard.14   The intuition behind
29:614:51925:28:28:72:528:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:this result is straightforward.  Recall that the CEO, even when her research is successful, has at
29:615:52023:28:29:72:520:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:best coarse information.  Thus while her tilting of the capital budget adds value on average, it
29:616:52119:29:28:72:540:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:does have a cost  in some states of the world.  In particular, when faced with one division that is a
29:617:52220:28:28:72:535:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:star (i.e., that is {G,G}) and one that is not, the CEO gives the star all four units of funding.  This
29:618:52323:28:8:72:534:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:full tilting of the capital budget toward the star is optimal if it turns out that the non-star division
30:619:52427:8:19:108:532:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:15In other words, equilibrium involves the intersection of two downwards-sloping curves
30:620:52514:19:14:72:531:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:in (eCEO, ehs) space.  Without any further restrictions on functional forms, it is possible that these
30:621:52616:14:0:71:254:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:two curves may cross more than once.
30:622:52654:0:28:72:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:is {B, B}.  However, the tilt is too extreme if the non-star division turns out to be {G, B}–ideally,
30:623:52755:28:28:71:449:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:it would be better to leave a {G, B} division with at least one unit of funding .  
30:624:52838:28:29:107:537:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:In other words, because of her coarse information, an activist CEO sometimes takes away
30:625:52925:29:28:71:515:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:too much from a {G, B} division.  And what is the cost of taking capital away from a  {G, B}
30:626:53017:28:28:71:500:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:division?  It depends on how profitable this division can be expected to be.  If its division
30:627:53110:28:29:71:501:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager is informed, the {G, B} division generates a greater expected return from a given
30:628:53199:29:28:71:517:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation of capital, as this capital is always steered to the better project within the division. 
30:629:53299:28:28:71:507:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus the opportunity cost of the CEO’s activism is greater when she runs the risk of taking
30:630:53390:28:29:71:311:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:resources away from informed division managers.
30:631:53437:29:28:107:536:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Note the symmetry that is at work here: the CEO’s research  incentives are blunted by the
30:632:53526:28:28:71:516:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility that the division managers will become informed, much as the division managers’
30:633:53617:28:29:71:529:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives are blunted by the possibility that the CEO will become informed.   That is, the more
30:634:53713:29:28:71:535:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:senior agent in the organization can be discouraged by the hard work of her subordinates, as well
30:635:53810:28:28:71:142:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:as vice-versa.  
30:636:53826:28:29:107:508:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:This symmetry has a couple of consequences.  First, since the CEO’s effort eCEO is a
30:637:53910:29:28:72:532:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:decreasing function of division managers’ efforts ehs, and conversely, the model–without further
30:638:54006:28:28:71:511:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:restrictions on the p( ) and q( ) functions–admits the possibility of multiple equilibria.15  For
30:639:54103:28:29:72:534:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, one might have either a “control-freak” equilibrium where the CEO is highly informed
30:640:54196:29:28:72:533:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:and intervenes often, and where the division managers are very discouraged, or a  “laissez-faire”
30:641:54293:28:0:72:528:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome where the reverse occurs.  Depending on parameter values, one equilibrium will be ex
31:642:54387:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:ante more efficient than the other, and there is no guarantee that a firm will not get stuck in the
31:643:54486:28:28:72:520:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:wrong equilibrium.  Thus, for example, the negative consequences of the hierarchical form of
31:644:54578:28:29:72:532:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:organization may be more pronounced for a firm that has gotten stuck in a control-freak culture,
31:645:54674:29:28:72:501:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:as opposed to one that has somehow managed to maintain a laissez-faire environment.     
31:646:54762:28:28:108:539:595:144:Times:144:Times:A:A further implication of the model with endogenous CEO effort is that it suggests another
31:647:54851:28:29:72:484:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizational form that may be optimal in some circumstances.  In the same way that
31:648:54935:29:28:72:509:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization can be valuable as a precommitment to get the CEO out of the picture–and
31:649:55024:28:28:72:513:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:thereby increase division-manager incentives–it might sometimes make sense to remove the
31:650:55112:28:29:72:522:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:division managers, so as to increase CEO incentives.  It is easy enough to construct numerical
31:651:55206:29:28:72:535:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:examples that have this feature.  The key is to make CEO effort both valuable and highly elastic,
31:652:55303:28:28:72:506:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:while making division-manager effort less so.  In such cases, we are left with just the CEO
31:653:55394:28:29:72:539:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:overseeing all four investment projects, which can be interpreted as an integrated (i.e., large) firm
31:654:55495:29:28:72:239:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:with a flat management structure.  
31:655:55530:28:28:108:510:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:Moreover,  the same logic–that removing some of her subordinates can improve the
31:656:55610:28:29:72:504:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:performance of the CEO–leads to a richer and more interesting rendition of organizational
31:657:55699:29:28:72:510:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:flatness if applied to a scaled-up version of the model.  Imagine that there are eight projects
31:658:55794:28:28:72:534:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:within the firm, and that the firm is initially organized in a pyramid structure with three layers of
31:659:55895:28:29:72:534:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:management: four low-level managers, who each oversee two projects; two mid-level managers,
31:660:55986:29:28:72:531:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:who each oversee two low-level-managers; and the CEO.  Now consider the effects of stripping
31:661:56078:28:28:72:540:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:out the two mid-level managers, leaving only the four low-level managers to report directly to the
31:662:56176:28:29:72:521:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:CEO.  There will be two distinct positive incentive effects.  First, the low-level managers will
31:663:56272:29:0:72:505:113:144:Times:144:Times:B:work harder, for the reasons outlined in Section II.D–they face less intervention from their
32:664:56364:0:19:108:532:188:52:Times:144:Times:A:16A large flat firm is all the more likely to be attractive if, in addition to soft information,
32:665:56460:19:21:72:387:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:there are other operating synergies that cut in favor of integration.
32:666:56529:21:19:108:531:148:52:Times:144:Times:A:17An example would be an academic department chair, who, having already decided that
32:667:56613:19:14:72:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:he wants to make a tenure offer to somebody, undertakes the process of writing for outside
32:668:56703:14:14:72:523:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:letters.  The letters may provide no new information to the department chair, but they can help
32:669:56798:14:0:72:349:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:him to credibly sell the case to a less-well-informed dean.
32:670:56859:0:28:72:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:immediate supervisors.  Second, the CEO will also work harder, for the reasons developed just
32:671:56952:28:28:72:523:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:above–she no longer anticipates that her research will be devalued by the competing efforts of
32:672:57046:28:29:72:228:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:her immediate subordinates.       
32:673:57080:29:28:108:503:623:144:Times:144:Times:A:Thus when we compare hard vs. soft information in terms of their implications for
32:674:57161:28:28:72:515:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizational form, we now have a new conclusion.  Not only does soft information tend to
32:675:57251:28:29:72:522:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:favor decentralization (i.e., smaller firms with fewer projects), but holding fixed a firm’s  size
32:676:57349:29:28:72:528:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  scope, soft information also favors a flatter, more streamlined management structure.16  To
32:677:57445:28:57:72:471:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:put it simply, extra layers of management are more costly when information is soft.
32:678:57528:57:28:108:489:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:C.  Hardness of Information is Endogenous: Excess Bureaucracy in Hierarchies
32:679:57604:28:28:108:530:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:I have been assuming throughout that the hardness of information is exogenous–either a
32:680:57690:28:29:72:520:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:division manager’s information can or cannot be credibly transmitted to the CEO, but there is
32:681:57783:29:28:72:522:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:nothing that the division manager can do to influence this.  An alternative approach is to posit
32:682:57879:28:28:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the degree of hardness is endogenous.  In particular, there may be cases where, by expending
32:683:57976:28:29:72:505:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:additional effort on documentation, a division manager can harden information that would
32:684:58064:29:28:72:163:283:144:Times:52:Times:B:otherwise be soft.17
32:685:58084:28:28:108:527:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:To capture this idea formally, I return to the version of the model in Section II.E, where
32:686:58174:28:0:72:531:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO does no research of her own, and make one modification.  Now each division manager
33:687:58266:0:28:72:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:can choose between one of two research technologies: he can either put one unit of effort into
33:688:58360:28:28:72:535:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:acquiring soft information, or he can put one unit of effort into acquiring hard information.  If he
33:689:58460:28:29:72:520:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:opts for soft information, there is a probability  ps that his research is successful.  If instead he
33:690:58560:29:28:72:530:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:chooses to go after hard information, there is a probability ph that his research is successful, and
33:691:58660:28:28:72:527:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditional on success, a probability z that the information actually turns out to be verifiable.  I
33:692:58760:28:29:72:507:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:assume that  ph   = $ps and $ < 1.  Thus effort devoted to acquiring hard information is less
33:693:58853:29:28:71:517:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:productive.  A  high value of $  means that information about the project in question is by its
33:694:58947:28:28:72:522:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:nature relatively easy to document, so that not too much of a price is paid to make it hard; one
33:695:59043:28:29:72:505:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:can think of the previous cases of absolutely “hard” and “soft” information in Section II as
33:696:59135:29:28:72:427:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponding to the polar extremes where  $ = 1 and $ = 0  respectively.
33:697:59208:28:28:108:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:It is easy to see that even when $  is substantially less than one, the only equilibrium may
33:698:59299:28:29:72:522:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:be one in which both division managers opt to go after hard information.  If both managers go
33:699:59392:29:28:72:527:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:after soft information, the CEO never learns anything, and we are effectively in a decentralized
33:700:59488:28:28:72:504:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcome, with each division manager’s effort yielding him a private benefit of  ps()d .  In
33:701:59578:28:29:72:523:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast, if one division manager deviates and goes after hard information, we know from part
33:702:59671:29:28:72:517:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:(iii) of Proposition 3 that this manager’s private benefit will exceed  ph( ()d + z/4).  So even
33:703:59765:28:28:72:536:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:when ph  is much smaller than  ps, hard information can yield higher private benefits.  This is just
33:704:59865:28:29:72:537:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:an application of the logic developed in Section II.E: hard information is much more attractive to
33:705:59963:29:28:72:536:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:division managers, because, unlike soft information,  it can help them get a larger capital budget.
33:706:60062:28:28:108:500:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:Moreover, while hard information is, all else equal, more valuable to the firm as a
33:707:60145:28:28:72:536:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:whole–it enables the CEO to make value-enhancing reallocations–division managers’ preference
33:708:60237:28:0:72:535:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:for it is far too strong.   That is, there are low values of  $  for which the firm would be better off
34:709:60340:0:19:108:509:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:18Note that when $ = 1, the firm is actually more valuable as a result of the fact that
34:710:60427:19:14:72:532:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:division managers choose to go after hard, rather than soft information.  This corresponds to the
34:711:60524:14:0:72:371:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:case where information is intrinsically hard, as in Section II.E.
34:712:60591:0:28:72:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:if the division managers pursued soft information, but division managers’ private incentives are
34:713:60687:28:28:72:522:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:such that they pursue hard information instead.18  This is because of an externality.  Manager i
34:714:60783:28:29:72:515:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:gets a first-order benefit of ( when he generates hard information that lands his division one
34:715:60877:29:28:72:538:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:additional unit of capital.  However, manager j  loses an equal amount, and the gain to the firm as
34:716:60976:28:28:72:415:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:a whole is only proportional to the improved net return on this one unit.
34:717:61049:28:29:108:533:567:144:Times:144:Times:A:This logic implies that when project information is innately hard to document (i.e., when
34:718:61138:29:28:71:485:538:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:B:$  is small but non-zero) the costs of a hierarchical form of organization may manifest
34:719:61224:28:28:72:534:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:themselves not just as division managers slacking off and doing no research, as in Section II.D.  
34:720:61322:28:29:72:527:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rather, one may observe division managers working extremely hard at creating the wrong kind
34:721:61413:29:28:72:533:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:of information.  In other words, a hierarchy may be characterized by a great deal of bureaucracy,
34:722:61510:28:28:72:524:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the sense of division managers generating lots of reports that are very well-documented, but
34:723:61605:28:29:72:513:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:ultimately not terribly informative.  And conversely,  if a  hierarchical firm is broken up, the
34:724:61701:29:56:72:532:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:excessive bureaucracy vanishes, and division managers instead produce only soft information.   
34:725:61796:56:29:108:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:IV.  Empirical Implications: A Closer Look at Banks’ Small-Business Lending Practices
34:726:61881:29:28:108:535:283:144:Times:144:Times:A:The most basic implication of the theory developed above is that large, hierarchical firms
34:727:61971:28:28:72:512:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:are at a comparative disadvantage when information about individual investment projects is
34:728:62061:28:29:72:527:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:innately soft.   Moreover, if one takes the model seriously, the hardness or softness that is most
34:729:62159:29:28:72:536:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:relevant for organizational form has to do with information about  those “small” projects that are
34:730:62257:28:0:72:527:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:overseen by line managers.  In other words, what matters is the nature of  information that, in a
35:731:62354:0:19:108:480:202:52:Times:144:Times:A:19There are of course a number of big strategic investment decisions where no
35:732:62431:19:14:72:525:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:information produced by line managers comes into play.  (E.g.: Should the company look for a
35:733:62523:14:14:72:537:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:merger partner?  Or expand overseas?)  In such cases, one might think of  the CEO–perhaps with
35:734:62617:14:14:72:501:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:the help of outside consultants–more or less doing all the research directly herself, so that
35:735:62710:14:14:72:528:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:information transmission within the firm is not an issue.  Whether the information produced by
35:736:62804:14:22:72:454:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:the CEO in these cases is hard or soft  is less relevant for organizational form.   
35:737:62888:22:0:108:459:105:52:Times:144:Times:A:20See Tirole 1988 (Chapter 10) for a discussion of the replacement effect.
35:738:62964:0:28:72:497:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchical setting, would be produced far from the ultimate decisionmaker, the CEO.19 
35:739:63051:28:28:108:508:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:While these ideas would seem to have significant empirical content, there are many
35:740:63133:28:29:72:512:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:challenges in mapping the theory into a set of precise, differentiating predictions that can be
35:741:63228:29:28:72:538:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:readily tested.  For example, one interesting implication of the theory is that small firms might be
35:742:63328:28:28:72:511:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:better able than large ones to engage in certain types of new product development, since the
35:743:63420:28:29:72:520:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:prospects of many new products must often be assessed based on soft information.  However,
35:744:63510:29:28:72:520:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:any empirical test of this proposition would have to control for a variety of other mechanisms
35:745:63604:28:28:72:537:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:that could lead to a broadly similar outcome–e.g., the well-known “replacement effect”, whereby
35:746:63699:28:29:72:507:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:large firms are discouraged from innovating for fear of cannibalizing their existing product
35:747:63791:29:28:72:536:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:lines.20  Implementing such a control would most likely require a careful case-by-case analysis of
35:748:63889:28:28:72:222:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:the new products in question.   
35:749:63921:28:29:108:539:397:144:Times:144:Times:A: These sorts of complications underscore  why it can be particularly informative to look at
35:750:64012:29:28:72:532:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:small-business lending by banks.  Here we have a well-defined  “industry” where: i) it is easy to
35:751:64109:28:28:72:527:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:identify the primary “projects” that line managers must choose among–namely, individual loan
35:752:64201:28:29:72:518:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:applications; and moreover ii) it seems quite plausible that information about these particular
35:753:64296:29:109:72:243:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:projects is likely to be innately soft.
36:754:64335:109:19:108:537:174:52:Times:144:Times:A:21A recent survey by Berger, Demsetz and Strahan (1999) provides a much  more detailed
36:755:64421:19:21:72:306:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:and comprehensive discussion of this literature.  
36:756:64471:21:19:108:492:134:52:Times:144:Times:A:22Relatedly, Brickley, Linck and Smith (2000) document that large banks are the
36:757:64550:19:14:72:540:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:dominant players in densely populated metropolitan areas (where presumably borrowers are more
36:758:64643:14:0:72:507:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to be big firms) while small banks have a greater role in suburban and rural regions. 
36:759:64738:0:28:108:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:The following findings emerge from the empirical literature on small-business lending.21  
36:760:64828:28:28:71:538:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:First, small banks invest a much greater share of their assets in small-business loans than do large
36:761:64928:28:29:71:521:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks (Nakamura (1994), Berger, Kashyap and Scalise (1995), Berger and Udell (1996), Peek
36:762:65017:29:28:71:529:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Rosengren (1996) and  Strahan and Weston (1996)).22  Perhaps more strikingly, when large
36:763:65109:28:28:71:538:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:banks acquire small banks, the small-business lending of the new combined organization tends to
36:764:65204:28:29:71:533:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:fall significantly (Peek and Rosengren (1998), Berger et al (1998), Sapienza (1998)).  Moreover,
36:765:65300:29:28:71:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:it appears that the loans that are cut as a result of consolidation are not cut simply because they
36:766:65399:28:28:71:519:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:are negative-NPV–i.e., because the acquiring bank is cleaning out the bad loans of the target. 
36:767:65494:28:29:71:524:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:Two pieces of evidence support this view.  Berger et al (1998) establish that many of the loans
36:768:65589:29:28:71:541:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are cut in the process of consolidation are picked up by other banks in the same local market. 
36:769:65689:28:28:71:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:And Sapienza (1998) finds that there is no relationship between a borrowing firm’s credit quality
36:770:65786:28:29:71:486:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the likelihood that it will have its lending relationship severed following a merger.
36:771:65875:29:28:107:529:368:144:Times:144:Times:A:Although these patterns are broadly consistent with the theory developed above, they do
36:772:65962:28:28:71:527:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:not really pinpoint the exact mechanism at work.   That is, they do not explain why large banks
36:773:66057:28:29:72:516:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:might be disadvantaged at small-business lending.  However, other findings are beginning to
36:774:66148:29:28:72:476:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:emerge which speak more directly to the central idea of this paper, namely that large
36:775:66233:28:28:72:501:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizations are not well-suited to handling soft information.   Three types of studies are
36:776:66325:28:107:72:187:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:especially worth noting.
37:777:66349:107:19:108:492:120:52:Times:144:Times:A:23More precisely, standard measures of borrower credit quality do a better job of
37:778:66430:19:0:72:407:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:explaining (in an R2 sense) the loan approval decisions of large banks.
37:779:66503:0:28:108:538:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:First, it appears that it is not just bank size per se that discourages small-business lending,
37:780:66598:28:28:72:535:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:but rather organizational complexity.  For example, DeYoung, Goldberg and White (1997) show
37:781:66689:28:29:72:525:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:that controlling for a bank’s size and age, its proclivity for making small-business loans is also
37:782:66787:29:28:72:521:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:negatively related to the number of branches it has, as well as to its being part of a multi-bank
37:783:66884:28:28:72:513:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:holding company.  Keeton (1995) finds similar results, with a particularly negative effect on
37:784:66977:28:29:72:479:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:small-business lending for banks that are owned by out-of-state holding companies.  
37:785:67061:29:28:108:529:538:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second, there is some evidence that in making small-business loans, large banks tend to
37:786:67148:28:28:72:527:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:shy away from those “difficult credits” where soft information is likely to be most important in
37:787:67244:28:29:72:538:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:assessing whether or not the loan is positive-NPV.  Berger and Udell (1996) find that large banks
37:788:67341:29:28:72:511:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:charge about 100 basis points less on small-business loans than do small banks, and require
37:789:67432:28:28:72:529:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:collateral about 25% less often.  One interpretation of this result is that large banks only lend to
37:790:67532:28:29:72:529:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:those small customers whose financial position is so strong that detailed further investigation is
37:791:67630:29:28:72:127:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:not needed.
37:792:67641:28:28:108:531:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, Cole, Goldberg and White (1997) use a new survey of small-business finance to
37:793:67727:28:29:72:521:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:look at differences in the loan approval process across large and small banks.  They show that
37:794:67821:29:28:72:528:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:large banks (over $1 billion in assets) tend to base loan approvals primarily on standard criteria
37:795:67919:28:28:72:522:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtained from financial statements.  In contrast, “small banks deviate from these criteria more
37:796:68014:28:29:72:534:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:and appear to rely on their impression of the character of the borrower to a larger extent.”23  This
37:797:68114:29:28:72:409:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence fits very nicely with the spirit of the model developed above.
37:798:68185:28:0:108:536:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:While much of the foregoing discussion has implicitly treated the softness of information
38:799:68276:0:28:72:535:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:in small-bank lending as an exogenously fixed parameter, there is evidence that this parameter is
38:800:68373:28:28:72:540:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:changing over time, with improvements in information technology, widespread adoption of credit
38:801:68467:28:29:72:519:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:scoring models, and the growth of “infomediaries” such as Dun and Bradstreet.  Petersen and
38:802:68558:29:28:72:539:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rajan (2000) document that the physical distance between small firms and their bankers has been
38:803:68653:28:28:72:539:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:growing–from an average of 16 miles in the 1970's to 68 miles in the 1990's–a pattern which they
38:804:68749:28:29:72:526:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpret as evidence that an increasing amount of hard information is being brought to bear on
38:805:68844:29:28:72:527:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:credit decisions.  If their interpretation is correct, and if this  trend continues, then the model of
38:806:68946:28:28:72:513:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:this paper suggests that the comparative advantage of small banks in small-business lending
38:807:69037:28:57:72:214:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:should diminish in the future.
38:808:69067:57:28:108:250:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:V.  Related Theoretical Work
38:809:69095:28:29:108:528:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:The ideas in this paper are related to several distinct strands of earlier theoretical work. 
38:810:69188:29:28:72:510:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey, I will just briefly discuss a few of the most
38:811:69280:28:28:72:530:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct linkages.  One branch of the literature takes the perspective that firms are organized so as
38:812:69379:28:29:72:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:to be maximally efficient at the processing and communication of various types of information. 
38:813:69474:29:28:72:522:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:(See, e.g., Sah and Stiglitz (1986), Radner (1993), Bolton and Dewatripont (1994), Harris and
38:814:69567:28:28:72:515:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:Raviv (1999)).   Although information production and transmission are clearly central to my
38:815:69658:28:29:72:514:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:story as well, I differ from these other works in a couple of ways.  First, I focus explicitly on
38:816:69755:29:28:72:514:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers’ private incentives to create and pass on various types of information, whereas the
38:817:69847:28:28:72:508:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:above-mentioned papers abstract away from agency problems within the firm.  Second, the
38:818:69934:28:28:72:528:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:notion of authority is more prominent in my model.  In particular, the CEO does more than just
38:819:70028:28:0:72:526:114:144:Times:144:Times:B:listen to and act on reports from her subordinates; she actually controls the resources that these
39:820:70128:0:28:72:299:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:subordinates work with and derive utility from.
39:821:70175:28:28:108:518:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:The soft-information variant of the model–which emphasizes how the CEO’s capital-
39:822:70256:28:29:72:517:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation authority can discourage division managers from doing research–is, as has already
39:823:70348:29:28:72:509:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:been noted, closely related to Aghion and Tirole (1997).  On a similar note, Rotemberg and
39:824:70438:28:28:72:514:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:Saloner (1994) argue that firms may wish to avoid being too broad in scope.  For if there are
39:825:70531:28:29:72:534:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:credit constraints at the firm level, such narrowness can help the CEO commit to employees that
39:826:70626:29:28:72:491:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:she will adopt any good ideas that they generate, thereby strengthening ex ante research
39:827:70714:28:28:72:522:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives.  More generally, the idea that agents’ incentives are weaker when they do not have
39:828:70808:28:29:72:526:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:control over asset-allocation decisions is familiar from the work of Grossman and Hart (1986),
39:829:70902:29:28:72:272:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hart and Moore (1990), and Hart (1995). 
39:830:70942:28:28:108:536:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:However, a sharp distinction between my model and these “costs-of-integration” theories
39:831:71029:28:29:72:530:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:arises when information is hard, rather than soft.  With completely hard information, there is no
39:832:71126:29:28:72:517:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:downside to integration in my model.  To the contrary, the fact that division managers do not
39:833:71219:28:28:72:511:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:have control actually serves to heighten their incentives, as they struggle to produce enough
39:834:71312:28:29:72:537:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive information to convince the CEO to give them a larger share of the capital budget.  Thus
39:835:71409:29:28:72:486:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:the model not only paints a generally more favorable picture of the incentive effects of
39:836:71497:28:28:72:490:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:integration than much of the recent literature, its comparative statics with respect to the
39:837:71588:28:29:72:539:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:hardness/softness of information also imply more nuanced empirical implications.  The empirical
39:838:71683:29:28:72:534:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:distinctions among the theories are underscored by the facts from the banking industry: the other
39:839:71780:28:28:72:486:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost-of-integration stories cannot easily explain why large banks might be at more of a
39:840:71867:28:29:72:493:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:disadvantage in small-business lending than in, say, credit-card or mortgage lending.     
39:841:71957:29:0:108:500:113:144:Times:144:Times:A:In some ways, the hard-information version of the model–with managers trying to
40:842:72036:0:19:108:519:160:52:Times:144:Times:A:24The positive, information-creating effects of self-interested advocacy have also been
40:843:72123:19:21:72:468:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:emphasized by Rotemberg and Saloner (1995) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1999).
40:844:72200:21:19:108:525:120:52:Times:144:Times:A:25Other papers that stress the negative aspects of intra-firm struggles for capital include
40:845:72291:19:0:72:406:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rajan, Servaes and Zingales (2000) and Scharfstein and Stein (2000).
40:846:72361:0:28:72:528:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:convince the CEO to give them more capital–is also reminiscent of the influence-cost literature
40:847:72456:28:28:72:539:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Milgrom (1988), Milgrom and Roberts (1988), Meyer, Milgrom and Roberts (1992)).  However,
40:848:72546:28:29:72:511:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:when information is innately hard (i.e., when $ = 1), the welfare implications are reversed. 
40:849:72639:29:28:72:531:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:Unlike in the influence-cost models, division managers’ efforts to sway the CEO are productive
40:850:72733:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:here, rather than wasteful.24   It should be noted, though, that this positive result is quite sensitive
40:851:72837:28:29:72:533:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the details of the information structure.  When the hardness of information is endogenous and
40:852:72933:29:28:71:503:538:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:B:$ is low (as in Section III.C), division managers’ efforts to attract more capital can lead to
40:853:73027:28:28:72:536:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:inefficient levels of bureaucracy, a result very much in the spirit of the influence-cost theories.25  
40:854:73130:28:29:108:518:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, it is worth touching on the connection between my model and recent work by
40:855:73213:29:28:72:523:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hart and Moore (1999).   In their model, some agents (specialists) have ideas about individual
40:856:73307:28:28:72:524:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:assets, while other agents (coordinators) have ideas about how to use multiple assets together. 
40:857:73403:28:29:72:514:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:These ideas are mutually exclusive, so that only one agent’s idea can be implemented with a
40:858:73494:29:28:72:533:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:given asset.  Moreover, there is no ex post renegotiation.  In this setting, the organization-design
40:859:73594:28:28:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:problem is to allocate decision rights ex ante in such a way as to make sure that the best ideas get
40:860:73694:28:29:72:187:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:implemented ex post.    
40:861:73718:29:28:108:511:283:144:Times:144:Times:A:Perhaps the most significant distinction between the models has to do with Hart and
40:862:73801:28:28:72:522:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moore’s assumption that the ideas of different agents in the firm are mutually exclusive.  This
40:863:73896:28:39:72:491:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:exclusivity in turn rests on the premise that the firm’s assets can be combined in certain
41:864:73986:39:19:108:520:188:52:Times:144:Times:A:26For example, it is hard to imagine that Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric, has
41:865:74072:19:14:72:490:169:144:Times:144:Times:B:many ideas about how to use the assets of NBC and GE’s aircraft division together in a
41:866:74158:14:14:72:534:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:synergistic fashion.  In the context of my model, Welch would not spend his time thinking about
41:867:74253:14:14:72:511:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:how to generate synergies between these two divisions; instead he would think about which
41:868:74342:14:22:72:232:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:division should get more capital. 
41:869:74376:22:0:108:445:105:52:Times:144:Times:A:27This idea is stressed by Holmstrom and Tirole (1993), among others.
41:870:74447:0:28:72:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:synergistic ways–a premise that may be more appropriate in some situations than others.26   In
41:871:74541:28:28:72:500:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast, in my model, the  research of the CEO and the division managers can be ex post
41:872:74629:28:29:72:503:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary.  Specifically, the CEO’s research can help her decide to allocate a certain
41:873:74719:29:28:72:498:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:amount of capital to a given division manager, who then draws on his own more detailed
41:874:74805:28:28:72:513:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:knowledge to make the right sub-allocations to individual projects within the division.  As a
41:875:74898:28:29:72:518:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:result, there is no issue of ex post inefficiency when both the CEO and the division managers
41:876:74991:29:28:72:529:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:have “ideas”.  Rather, the problem is the ex ante one of creating incentives for them to generate
41:877:75088:28:28:72:208:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:these ideas in the first place.

41:879:75119:29:28:108:189:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:VI.  Conclusions
41:880:75135:28:28:108:538:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:By way of conclusion, it is useful to point out a limitation of the model developed above. 
41:881:75226:28:29:72:535:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:At a fundamental level, the question being asked is: “What organizational form–decentralization
41:882:75321:29:28:72:523:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:or hierarchy–does the best job of allocating capital to competing investment projects?”  But in
41:883:75416:28:28:72:522:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:addressing the question, the entire focus has been on information production and transmission
41:884:75509:28:29:72:526:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:inside firms.  As a result, the idea that valuable information might also be generated by outside
41:885:75606:29:28:72:508:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:investors–e.g., by traders in the stock market–has been ignored.27  In particular, I have been
41:886:75700:28:28:72:539:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:implicitly assuming that outside investors have a fixed prior about investment opportunities, such
41:887:75798:28:79:72:530:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:that they always find it optimal to give a firm exactly one unit of funding for each project that it
42:888:75898:79:19:108:495:148:52:Times:144:Times:A:28As noted above, even if the stock market (or any other outside capital provider)
42:889:75980:19:14:72:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:produces the same information about divisions i and j as an integrated-firm CEO, it does not
42:890:76072:14:14:72:520:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:follow that decentralization is equivalent to hierarchy.  This is because under decentralization
42:891:76168:14:0:72:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is no analog to the CEO’s authority to take all funding away from a non-star division.  
42:892:76264:0:28:72:176:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:has under its control. 
42:893:76287:28:28:108:536:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:Clearly, it would be nice to incorporate endogenous stock-market information production
42:894:76374:28:29:72:517:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:into the model.  There are several further issues that this sort of extension might allow one to
42:895:76470:29:28:72:530:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:address.  For example, the ability of outside investors to undertake their own research may alter
42:896:76567:28:28:72:534:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:the net benefits of decentralization relative to hierarchy.  Recall that the drawback to splitting up
42:897:76668:28:29:72:527:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:divisions i and j  in the model is that there is then no possibility of moving resources from i to j
42:898:76768:29:28:72:525:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:when j has the better investment prospects.  But if outside investors can reproduce some of the
42:899:76863:28:28:72:524:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:information that an integrated-firm CEO would otherwise generate, then stock prices might be
42:900:76955:28:29:72:284:482:144:Times:52:Times:B:useful in guiding reallocations from  i to  j.28
42:901:77003:29:28:108:524:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:Moreover, further subtleties arise when one recognizes that the quality of stock-market
42:902:77090:28:28:72:539:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:information is likely to depend on firm size and scope.  On the one hand, a potential advantage of
42:903:77188:28:29:72:517:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:decentralization is that it leads to stock prices that are specific to narrow, “pure-play”  sets of
42:904:77287:29:28:72:520:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:assets, thereby providing more precise guidance for investment decisions.  On the other hand,
42:905:77380:28:28:72:539:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:pushed too far, decentralization may dampen the overall amount of stock-market information that
42:906:77475:28:29:72:532:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:is produced: given fixed costs of information acquisition, very small firms may not attract much
42:907:77571:29:28:72:496:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:interest from either sophisticated investors or stock analysts.  By taking such factors into
42:908:77663:28:28:72:519:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:consideration, one might hope to develop a more complete understanding of the link between
42:909:77753:28:0:72:356:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:organizational form and the efficiency of capital allocation.
43:910:77816:0:28:108:155:680:144:Times:144:Times:A:Appendix
43:911:77824:28:29:108:218:652:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof of Proposition 2:
43:912:77847:29:28:108:520:623:144:Times:144:Times:A:First, straightforward calculation establishes that a sufficient condition for the CEO to
43:913:77936:28:28:72:535:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:prefer an allocation of at least three units to a lone-star division (rather than just giving two units
43:914:78039:28:29:72:503:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:to each division) is: g(2)/2 > (2g(1) +  b(1))/3.  This condition is clearly satisfied if, as the
43:915:78136:29:28:72:535:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:proposition requires, g(2)/2 > (3g(1) +  b(1))/4.  So it must be that a lone-star division will get at
43:916:78238:28:28:72:203:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:least three units of funding.
43:917:78267:28:29:108:535:482:144:Times:144:Times:A:Now suppose that a lone-star division does in fact get exactly three units of funding.  It is
43:918:78360:29:28:72:527:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:easy to show that equation (6) in the text is modified so that the gain )hs in expected net output
43:919:78458:28:57:72:365:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:when a division manager’s research is successful is given by:
43:920:78519:57:56:143:530:368:191:g_d0_f4:144:Times:A:)hs =  )d  -  q(2g(2) - 3g(1) - b(1))/16    (A.1)
43:921:78568:56:29:108:538:312:144:Times:144:Times:A:But given the condition in the proposition, we know that (2g(2) - 3g(1) - b(1)) is positive. 
43:922:78661:29:28:72:539:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:So )hs <  )d, which in turn implies that ehs <  ed.   Thus even when the tilt in the capital budget is
43:923:78763:28:28:72:496:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:less extreme, a hierarchy induces less research effort than under decentralization.  That a
43:924:78854:28:29:72:521:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchy also may also lead to lower output–i.e., that we may have Yhs < Yd–follows from the
43:925:78947:29:56:72:485:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:same reasoning as in the example that was used to illustrate Proposition 1 in the text.  
43:926:79036:56:28:108:218:142:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof of Proposition 3:
43:927:79059:28:0:108:538:114:144:Times:144:Times:A:I begin by assuming that the division-manager reporting strategies are as described in part
44:928:79152:0:28:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(i) of the proposition; I will verify momentarily that these strategies are optimal for the division
44:929:79252:28:28:72:526:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:managers.  With these reporting strategies, the CEO updates on a quiet division manager using
44:930:79345:28:29:72:522:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:equations (9)-(11) in the text.  Given these updating rules, let us ask what the CEO does when
44:931:79439:29:28:72:538:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:she faces one division manager that reports {G, G} and another one that is quiet.  It is not hard  to
44:932:79540:28:28:72:508:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:show that, for any value of  zpc, it will be optimal for the CEO to give at least three units of
44:933:79636:28:29:72:525:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital to the {G, G} division if the following sufficient condition (which is the one required in
44:934:79734:29:28:72:530:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:the statement of the proposition) holds: g(2)/2 > (3g(1) +  b(1))/4.   Conversely, it is easy to see
44:935:79834:28:28:72:531:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:that there is never any advantage to deviating from the equal-funding allocation under any other
44:936:79930:28:29:72:146:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:circumstances. 
44:937:79945:29:28:108:515:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:If the CEO follows these capital-allocation rules, then it must in fact be optimal for a
44:938:80033:28:28:72:514:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:division manager to speak up when his information is either {G, G} or {G, B}.  In the former
44:939:80125:28:29:72:535:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:case, he may get a third or fourth unit of capital by speaking up, and in the latter case, he ensures
44:940:80226:29:28:72:529:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:that he will not be reduced down to one or zero units (which could happen if he were quiet and 
44:941:80321:28:28:72:524:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:the other division reported {G, G}).  It is also at least weakly better for the division manager to
44:942:80420:28:29:72:516:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:remain silent when his information is {B, B}.  Indeed, for many parameter values it is strictly
44:943:80515:29:28:72:537:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:better, since a division that reports {B, B} will get allocated zero units of capital in circumstances
44:944:80617:28:28:72:270:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:when a quiet division would get one unit.
44:945:80658:28:29:108:538:227:144:Times:144:Times:A:These arguments establish parts (i) and (ii) of the proposition.  To prove part (iii), assume
44:946:80751:29:28:72:524:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:that when a {G, G} division manager is paired with a quiet one, the former is allocated exactly
44:947:80846:28:28:71:533:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:three units of capital.  This will establish a lower bound on the gains to being informed, as being
44:948:80945:28:28:71:535:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:informed would be strictly more attractive if a {G, G} division were to get four units of capital in
44:949:81045:28:0:72:534:114:144:Times:52:Times:B:this situation.  Now take the perspective of manager i, assuming that manager j exerts effort of ej
45:950:81146:0:28:72:495:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:and therefore has a probability of research success of p(ej ).   (This implies that there is a
45:951:81240:28:28:72:526:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability zp(ej ) that manager j will uncover hard information, and a probability zp(ej )/4  that
45:952:81339:28:29:72:509:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager j will be able to document to the CEO that his division is {G, G}.)  A little algebra
45:953:81432:29:28:72:501:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:yields the following expression for the expected gross output gain  )ihh to manager i if his
45:954:81524:28:57:72:178:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:research is successful:
45:955:81547:57:28:108:483:538:144:Times:144:Times:A:  )ihh = )d +  z/4 +  z(4g(2) - 4g(1))/16 +  z p(ej )(2g(1) + 2b(1) - 2g(2))/16  +
45:956:81629:28:57:108:530:510:144:Times:144:Times:A: z2 p(ej )(2g(1))/16(A.2)
45:957:81654:57:56:108:192:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:This implies that:
45:958:81672:56:57:108:530:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:  )ihh > )d +  z/4 +  z p(ej )(2g(2) + 2b(1) - 2g(1))/16  +  z2 p(ej )(2g(1))/16(A.3)
45:959:81757:57:28:108:513:340:144:Times:144:Times:A:It then follows immediately from (A.3) that   )ihh > )d +  z/4 for any value of  p(ej ),
45:960:81845:28:29:71:534:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:which establishes part (iii) of the proposition.  Part (iv) is then obvious, since in a hierarchy with
45:961:81947:29:28:71:526:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:hard information there is both more information produced than under decentralization, plus the
45:962:82041:28:28:71:483:255:144:Times:144:Times:B:added advantage that the CEO reallocates funds across divisions according to a value-
45:963:82126:28:0:71:175:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximizing criterion.
