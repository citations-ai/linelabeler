2:29:1547:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:30:1555:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We argue that once we take into account the students' rational enrollment decisions, mismatch in the
2:31:1655:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:sense that the intended beneficiary of affirmative action admission policies are made worse off could
2:32:1756:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:occur only if selective universities possess private information about students' post-enrollment treatment
2:33:1862:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:effects. This necessary condition for mismatch provides the basis for a new test. We propose an empirical
2:34:1967:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:methodology to test for private information in such a setting. The test is implemented using data from
2:35:2069:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:Campus Life and Learning Project (CLL) at Duke. Evidence shows that Duke does possess private
2:36:2162:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:information that is a statistically significant predictor of the students' post-enrollment academic performance.
2:37:2274:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:We also propose strategies to evaluate more conclusively whether the evidence of Duke private information
2:38:2379:14:42:72:190:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:has generated mismatch.

3:66:2881:0:28:72:185:722:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:67:2898:28:18:88:539:694:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The use of racial preferences in college and university admissions has generated much debate.
3:68:2991:18:18:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Proponents of racial preferences argue that race-conscious admissions are important both for helping
3:69:3091:18:17:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:minorities overcome the legacy of the institutionalized discrimination and for majority students to
3:70:3190:17:18:72:539:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:receive  the  benefits  from  diverse  classrooms.1Opponents  of  racial  preferences  assert  that  race-
3:71:3296:18:17:72:540:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conscious  admissions  are  unfair  and  may  actually  be  damaging  to  the  intended  beneficiaries  by
3:72:3402:17:18:72:379:606:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:placing them at institutions where they are unlikely to succeed.2
3:73:3467:18:18:88:539:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Recently the controversy over race-conscious admission policies has increasingly moved from a
3:74:3560:18:17:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:normative to a positive perspective.  On one front, several papers attempted to empirically exam-
3:75:3657:17:18:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ine the educational benefits of attending racially diverse colleges.  For example, Black, Daniels and
3:76:3758:18:17:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Smith  (2001)  found  a  positive  relationship  between  proportion  of  blacks  in  the  college  attended
3:77:3866:17:18:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  the  post-graduate  earnings  in  the  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Youth;  Arcidiacono  and
3:78:3970:18:18:72:540:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Vigdor (2009), using information on graduates of 30 selective universities in College and Beyond
3:79:4066:18:17:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data, found only weak evidence of any relationship between collegiate racial composition and the
3:80:4162:17:18:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:post-graduation outcomes of white or Asian students.3Duncan et.  al.  (2006), exploiting condi-
3:81:4257:18:18:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tional random roommate assignment at one large public university, found that cross-racial exposure
3:82:4355:18:17:72:334:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:influences individual attitudes and friendship patterns.
3:83:4411:17:18:88:539:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A second front, spurred by the provocative article of Sander (2004) and followed up by Ayres and
3:84:4507:18:17:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Brooks (2005), Ho (2005), Chambers et.  al.  (2005), Barnes (2007) and Rothstein and Yoon (2008),
3:85:4604:17:18:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attempts to empirically examine whether the effects of affirmative action policies on the intended
3:86:4702:18:18:72:539:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:beneficiaries  is  positive  or  negative.   These  papers  essentially  tests  for  the  so-called  “mismatch
3:87:4812:18:17:72:539:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis,” i.e.  whether the outcomes of minority students might have been worsened as a result
3:88:4909:17:18:72:442:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of attending a selective university relative to attending a less selective school.
3:89:4991:18:17:88:539:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:But even if some of the outcomes for minority students are worse under affirmative action, it
3:90:5084:17:18:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:still may be the case that minority students are better off under affirmative action.  To illustrate
3:91:5184:18:18:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this point, suppose that one can convincingly establish that blacks are less likely to pass bar exams
3:92:5285:18:17:72:539:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:after attending an elite law school.  Does this necessarily mean that blacks are worse off in anex
3:93:5383:17:18:72:539:236:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:anteexpected utility sense?  If attending an elite university also makes it possible for blacks to be
3:94:5484:18:18:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high-profile judges, and if the outcome of being a high-profile judge is valued by blacks much higher
3:95:5585:18:17:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than just passing the bar exam, blacks could still be better offex  anteunder affirmative action.
3:96:5682:17:19:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Alternatively, it is possible that elite universities may provide amenities to minority students that
3:97:5783:19:18:84:540:164:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f7:F:1In  bothRegents of University of California v.  Bakke438  U.S.  265  (1978)  and  more  recently  inGrutter v.
3:98:5894:18:15:72:539:146:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f6:F:Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), the Supreme Court ruled that the educational benefits of a diverse student body is a
3:99:6010:15:11:72:382:131:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:compelling state interest that can justify using race in university admissions.
3:100:6089:11:15:84:503:120:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:2See Kellough (2006) for a concise introduction to various arguments for and against affirmative action.
3:101:6193:15:18:84:540:105:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3Arcidiacono,  Khan,  and  Vigdor  (2008)  also  suggest  that  affirmative  action  actually  leads  tolessinter-racial
3:102:6313:18:0:72:538:87:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:interaction due to the exacerbation of the within-school gap between minority and majority academic backgrounds.
4:103:6426:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more  than  compensate  the  worse  outcome  measures  that  are  examined  by  the  researcher,  thus
4:104:6528:18:17:72:436:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:making the minority students better offex antein an expected utility sense.
4:105:6603:17:18:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper we take a new and complementary viewpoint to the above-mentioned literature
4:106:6692:18:17:71:539:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on  mismatch  by  bringing  to  the  center  therational  decisionof  the  minority  students  who  are
4:107:6795:17:18:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:offered admission to a selective school, possibly due to affirmative action policies.  The question we
4:108:6897:18:18:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ask is, why would students be willing to enroll themselves at schools where they cannot succeed,
4:109:6993:18:17:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as the mismatch hypothesis stipulates?  Posing the question in this way immediately leads us to
4:110:7088:17:18:72:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:focus our attention to the role of asymmetric information.  We show that anecessary conditionfor
4:111:7184:18:17:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mismatch to occur once we take into account the minority students’ rational enrollment decisions
4:112:7280:17:18:72:539:564:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:is that the selective university has private information about the treatment effect of the students.4
4:113:7381:18:18:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In  the  absence  of  asymmetric  information  about  her  treatment  effect  in  the  selective  university
4:114:7489:18:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(relative to attending a non-selective university),  a minority student will choose to enroll in the
4:115:7589:17:18:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selective university only if her treatment effect is positive, thus there is no room for mismatch to
4:116:7689:18:18:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:occur.  However, when the selective university has private information about a minority student’s
4:117:7786:18:17:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment effect, it is possible that a minority student with a negative treatment effect may end up
4:118:7886:17:18:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:enrolling in the selective university if offered admission.  The reason is simple:  when the minority
4:119:7987:18:17:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student decides whether to enroll in the selective university,  she can only condition her decision
4:120:8086:17:18:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the event that her treatment is above its admission threshold.  When the selective university’s
4:121:8184:18:18:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:admission  threshold  for  the  minority  student  is  negative,  due  to  its  desire  to  satisfy  a  diversity
4:122:8297:18:17:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constraint for example, it may still be optimal for a minority student with a negative treatment
4:123:8393:17:18:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect to enroll as long as the average treatment effect conditional on admission is higher than that
4:124:8494:18:17:72:230:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the non-selective university.
4:125:8528:17:18:88:539:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The central message from the simple model is that the presence of private information by the
4:126:8620:18:18:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selective university regarding the students’ treatment effect is a necessary condition for mismatch
4:127:8719:18:17:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effect as a result of affirmative action.  This simple observation leads to a novel test for a necessary
4:128:8823:17:18:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:condition for mismatch, which is a test for whether selective universities possess private information
4:129:8925:18:17:72:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:regarding the students they admit.  We will emphasize that our test is only a test fornecessary
4:130:9020:17:18:72:539:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:condition:  if  we  find  strong  evidence  for  asymmetric  information,  it  does  not  necessarily  imply
4:131:9128:18:18:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that mismatch has occurred.  However, if we find no evidence for asymmetric information, then we
4:132:9224:18:17:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can rule out mismatch without having to rely on strong unverifiable assumptions needed for the
4:133:9318:17:18:72:258:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assessment of counterfactual outcomes.
4:134:9356:18:18:88:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We propose a non-parametric method to test for asymmetric information.  We assume that the
4:135:9446:18:19:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:researcher has access to the elite university’s assessment of the applicants, the applicants’ subjective
4:136:9550:19:18:84:539:139:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:4There is some evidence in the literature that students’ expectations about their performance are inaccurate and
4:137:9662:18:14:72:540:121:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:updated over time.  Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) have information at multiple points during the student’s
4:138:9777:14:14:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:college career from Berea college.  They find strong evidence of students updating their expectations over time and
4:139:9892:14:0:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:making decisions (such as the decision to drop out) based upon the new information they receive through their grades.
5:140:10010:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expectation about their post-enrollment performance in the selective university and their actual
5:141:10106:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performance.  We show that the celebrated Kotlarski (1967) theorem can be used to decompose the
5:142:10201:17:18:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:private information possessed by the applicant, the private information possessed by the selective
5:143:10299:18:17:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:university, and the information common to the selective university and the applicant but unobserved
5:144:10398:17:18:72:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the researcher.5We propose an estimation method after the Kotlarski decomposition to test
5:145:10490:18:18:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether  the  selective  university  possess  private  information  important  for  the  prediction  of  the
5:146:10598:18:17:72:277:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students’ actual post-enrollment outcomes.
5:147:10640:17:18:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We  use  data  from  the  Campus  Life  and  Learning  Project  (CLL),  which  surveys  two  recent
5:148:10739:18:17:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consecutive  cohorts  of  Duke  University  students  before  and  during  college.   The  survey  was  ad-
5:149:10846:17:18:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ministered to all under-represented minorities in each of the cohorts as well as a random sample
5:150:10942:18:18:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of whites and Asians.  The CLL provides information about the participants’ college expectations,
5:151:11039:18:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:social and family background, and satisfaction measures as well as providing confidential access to
5:152:11138:17:18:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students academic records.  The key features of the data for our purposes is that we have Duke
5:153:11232:18:18:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Admission Office’s ranking of the applicants as well as the student’s pre-enrollment expectations
5:154:11329:18:17:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about their grade point average.  We also have a rich set of control variables about the students’
5:155:11427:17:18:72:242:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:family and high school background.
5:156:11461:18:17:88:539:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We test whether Duke’s private information is important to outcomes such as grade point aver-
5:157:11554:17:18:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:age after conditioning on what is in the student’s information set, including the private information
5:158:11655:18:18:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the student’s expected grade point average.  Not only is Duke’s private information important for
5:159:11755:18:17:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:both grades and graduation rates even after conditioning on the student’s information set, but we
5:160:11852:17:18:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also find that the student has virtually no private information on their probabilities of succeeding.
5:161:11953:18:17:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:That is, once we condition on Duke’s information set, the student’s expected grade point average
5:162:12049:17:18:72:275:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is virtually uncorrelated with their grades.
5:163:12093:18:18:88:539:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We will also discuss in Section 7 how we can follow up our necessary condition test with addi-
5:164:12187:18:17:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tional data collection to more conclusively establish the presence or absence of mismatch.  It is also
5:165:12289:17:18:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:important to note that, regardless of whether we can empirically establish the presence/absence of
5:166:12387:18:17:72:540:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mismatch, our simple theory highlighting the rational enrollment decisions of the students naturally
5:167:12487:17:18:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests policies that will be effective to decrease the possibility of mismatch, namely, to increase
5:168:12588:18:18:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the information flow from the selective university to the minority students that can assist them in
5:169:12687:18:17:72:333:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:predicting their post-enrollment educational outcomes.
5:170:12741:17:18:88:539:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.   In  Section  2  we  discuss  the  mismatch
5:171:12846:18:18:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:literature.  In Section 3 we present a simple model of a selective university’s admission problem with
5:172:12948:18:17:72:540:158:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rational students to clarify the key concepts of mismatch in our framework, and illustrate that the
5:173:13047:17:18:72:540:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selective university’s private information is a necessary condition for mismatch to occur.  In Section
5:174:13149:18:20:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:4 we describe the Campus Life and Learning (CLL) Project data that we use in our application
5:175:13241:20:18:84:539:103:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:5Kotlarski theorem has been applied in economics in Krasnokutskaya (2008) and Cunha, Heckman and Navarro

6:177:13353:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  test  for  private  information.   In  Section  5  we  provide  some  baseline  regressions  to  provide
6:178:13461:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:some preliminary bounds the importance of Duke and student private information in predicting
6:179:13553:17:18:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students’ performance at Duke.  In Section 6 we describe a non-parametric empirical method to
6:180:13646:18:17:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identify private information and present our main empirical results.  In Section 7 we discuss two
6:181:13743:17:18:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:potential avenues to provide more conclusive evidence for mismatch; and Section 8 concludes.  In
6:182:13839:18:40:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Appendix, we discuss some data attrition issues and report some omitted regression coefficients.
6:183:13939:40:28:72:242:594:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2    Mismatch Literature
6:184:13963:28:18:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  mismatch  literature  to  date  has  focused  on  comparing  the  “outcome”  (e.g.,  GPA,  bar
6:185:14062:18:17:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:passage, post-graduate earnings etc.)  of the minority students enrolled in elite universities relative
6:186:14165:17:18:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  the  correspondingcounterfactualoutcome  when  these  minority  students  attend  less  selective
6:187:14266:18:18:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:universities.   As  well  summarized  in  Rothstein  and  Yoon  (2008),  the  papers  differ  in  how  the
6:188:14372:18:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:counterfactual outcomes are assessed.  For example, Sander (2004) first used a comparison of black
6:189:14470:17:18:72:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and white students with the sameobservablecredentials, who typically attend different law schools
6:190:14567:18:17:71:539:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because of affirmative action, to estimate a negative effect of selectivity on law school grades; he
6:191:14667:17:18:71:539:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:then included both selectivity and grades in a regression for graduation and bar passage where he
6:192:14764:18:18:71:539:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:found that both selectivity and grades have positive coefficient, with the latter much larger than
6:193:14862:18:17:71:540:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the former.6Combining these two findings, he concluded that, on net, preferences in law school
6:194:14956:17:18:71:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:admission in favor of black students depressed black outcomes because such preferences led black
6:195:15052:18:18:71:539:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students into more selective schools, lowering their law school grades, which swamps the positive
6:196:15149:18:17:71:453:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effective of attending a selective school on their graduation and passing the bar.
6:197:15231:17:18:88:539:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Ayres  and Brooks  (2005),  Ho (2005),  Chambers et.  al.  (2005)  and Barnes  (2007),  however,
6:198:15327:18:17:71:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used versions ofselective-nonselective  comparison,i.e., comparing students of the same race and
6:199:15423:17:18:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same observable admission credentials who attend more- and less-selective schools to assess whether
6:200:15522:18:18:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attending more selective schools has negative effects.7All strategies used above to assess the coun-
6:201:15622:18:17:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terfactual outcome are likely to yield biased estimates when there areunobservablecharacteristics
6:202:15719:17:18:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that may be considered in admission but unobserved by researchers.  For example, the selective-
6:203:15814:18:17:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unselective comparison used by Ayres and Brooks (2005), Ho (2005), Chambers et.  al.  (2005) and
6:204:15910:17:20:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Barnes (2007) are likely to underestimate mismatch effect because those who are admitted to more
6:205:16006:20:18:84:539:194:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:6Loury and Garman (1995) appears to be the predecessor of the “mismatch” literature.  They found that college
6:206:16115:18:15:72:540:176:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:selectivity and performance at college both have significant effects on earnings.  The earnings gain by black students
6:207:16233:15:14:72:540:161:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:from attending selective colleges are offset by worse college performance for those Black students whose own SAT
6:208:16345:14:11:72:485:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:scores are significantly below the median of the college they attended, i.e.  those “mismatched” blacks.
6:209:16449:11:18:84:539:136:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:7Barnes (2007) also explains that the performance for black students may suffer in a selective school both because
6:210:16563:18:15:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:of mismatch, i.e., they are over-placed in such selective schools, or because there are race-based barriers to effective
6:211:16683:15:0:72:185:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:learning in selective schools.
7:212:16714:0:18:72:539:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selective schools are likely to have better unobserved credentials.8In contrast, Sanders (2004), by
7:213:16813:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attributing  the  black’s  lower  grades  in  selective  schools  to  school  selectivity  instead  of  potential
7:214:16926:17:18:72:382:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unobserved credentials, is likely to overstate the mismatch effect.
7:215:16993:18:17:88:539:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  Rothstein  and  Yoon  (2008)  used  both  the  selective-unselective  and  the  black-white
7:216:17094:17:18:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comparisons to provide bounds for the mismatch effect in law school.  They find no evidence of
7:217:17188:18:18:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mismatch effects on any students’ employment outcomes or on the graduation or bar passage rates
7:218:17283:18:17:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of black students with moderate or strong entering credentials, a group that makes up 25% of the
7:219:17379:17:18:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample.  However, they could not conclusively find effects for the bottom 75% of the distribution
7:220:17476:18:17:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to not having enough whites with similar credentials.  We will argue that the success of the
7:221:17572:17:18:72:539:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top 25% isnecessaryfor mismatch to occur if blacks at least know the overall relationship between
7:222:17669:18:18:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:credentials and success while only have expectations on their own credentials.  Namely, if all blacks
7:223:17770:18:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were mismatched then there would be no scope for students making rational decisions to attend
7:224:17863:17:18:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:schools where they were mismatched: there has to be some non-mismatched black students in order
7:225:17958:18:18:72:221:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for rational mismatch to occur.
7:226:17989:18:17:88:539:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To summarize, the existing literature on the mismatch effect differs in the empirical strategy
7:227:18083:17:18:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:used to assess the counterfactual outcome of minority students attending less selective universities;
7:228:18184:18:17:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the evidence is mixed.  We want to recast the mismatch problem in the context of rational de-
7:229:18281:17:18:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cision making which, as show in the next section, points us towards examining whether universities
7:230:18379:18:40:72:378:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have private information on the future success of their students.
7:231:18444:40:28:72:174:365:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3    The Model
7:232:18458:28:18:88:539:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Consider two universities that differ in selectiveness.  For convenience, suppose that only one
7:233:18553:18:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:university is selective, which we refer to as the elite university. The elite university has an enrollment

7:240:19186:20:18:84:539:194:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:8Dale and Krueger (2002) proposed and applied a strategy to control for the unobservable credentials in estimating
7:241:19300:18:14:72:540:176:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the treatment effect of attending highly selective colleges by comparing students attending highly selective colleges
7:242:19417:14:14:72:540:162:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:with others admitted to these schools but enrolled elsewhere.  Ayres and Brooks (2005) and Sanders (2005b) also
7:243:19528:14:14:72:540:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:attempted to approximately apply the Dale and Krueger strategy by comparing law students who reported attending

7:245:19757:15:14:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:expensive or too far from home.  A potential problem is that they do not know whether those reporting attending
7:246:19868:14:14:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:their second choice would have been admitted to the schools attended by the former group, thus it is not clear that

8:249:20140:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Importantly, this treatment effect is determined by the quality of matching between the student’s
8:250:20237:17:18:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:own characteristics and the university’s characteristics.  To the extent that the non-elite university

8:253:20501:18:18:88:539:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We assume that the objective of the elite university is to maximize the total treatment effect
8:254:20595:18:17:71:539:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the admitted students subject to a capacity constraint and to a diversity constraint.9,10We
8:255:20690:17:18:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assume that the student is risk neutral, and thus will choose the university (if she is admitted) that
8:256:20792:18:33:72:255:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:offers her the highest treatment effect.

8:258:20895:25:17:88:539:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We first consider the case that the students know their treatment effects from attending the
8:259:20987:17:18:72:540:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:elite university.11In this symmetric information case, no students with a negative treatment effect
8:260:21086:18:18:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will matriculate in the elite university,  even if they are admitted.  Note if the university admits
8:261:21186:18:17:72:539:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a  student  of  racerand  treatment  effectT′r,  then  it  will  also  admit  all  students  of  racerwho
8:262:21291:17:18:72:539:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have treatment effects aboveT′r.  LetT∗rdenote the lowest treatment effect among those who are
8:263:21385:18:28:72:450:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:admitted of racer.  Thus the matriculation constraint for the students must be
8:264:21463:28:28:253:358:407:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:T∗r≥0 forr∈{w,b}.
8:265:21480:28:18:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:It  is  this  constraint  that  effectively  makesex  antemismatch  under  symmetric  information  im-
8:266:21582:18:17:71:539:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possible:  no student will attend a school where their treatment effect is negative.  Note that the
8:267:21681:17:18:71:516:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:matriculation constraint must hold regardless of the objective function of the elite university.
8:268:21777:18:18:88:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  elite  university’s  problem  is  then  to  maximize  the  treatment  effect  of  its  student  body
8:269:21882:18:29:71:205:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subject to three constraints:
8:270:21911:29:26:88:377:279:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•That enrollment is no larger thanC(capacity constraint);
8:271:21968:26:20:88:485:253:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•That the fraction of blacks attending is no less thanλ≥0 (diversity constraint);
8:272:22049:20:18:84:539:233:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:9The elite university may have other factor besides the treatment of the student in their objection function such
8:273:22162:18:14:72:540:215:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:as future donations or whether the treatment effect is positive relative to not attending college.  We note the effect
8:274:22280:14:14:72:540:201:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:of different objective functions throughout this section, though fundamentally a different objective function by the
8:275:22396:14:15:72:539:187:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:university will not change our conclusion that mismatch canonlyoccur when the university has private information
8:276:22508:15:14:72:539:172:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:about  the  treatment  effect  for  the  student.   It  will  become  clear  that  the  key  driver  of  our  result  isthe rational
8:277:22640:14:11:72:432:158:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f6:F:matriculation constraint of the students,notthe objective function of the elite university.
8:278:22731:11:18:80:539:147:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:10While we treat diversity as a constraint that must be satisfied here, the qualitative results do not change if we put
8:279:22850:18:14:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:a penalty function that penalizes deviations from optimal diversity levels into the objective function.  These results
8:280:22968:14:12:72:180:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:are available upon request.
8:281:22995:12:18:80:539:103:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:11Alternatively, both the student and the school could be uncertain about the treatment effect.  The key assumption
8:282:23110:18:0:72:504:85:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:is that they are operating with the same information set:  the university does not have private information.
9:283:23219:0:18:88:540:722:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•That  the  expected  treatment  effect  for  individuals  of  both  races  is  positive  (matriculation

13:468:30358:29:17:71:539:570:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f4:C:Proposition 2In the asymmetric information case, the elite university’s admission threshold for

13:473:30736:25:17:88:539:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We are now ready to present our main conclusion from the analysis so far.  First, let us pro-
13:474:30829:17:18:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vide several notions of “mismatch” as a result of affirmative action admission policies by the elite
13:475:30929:18:28:71:120:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:university.
13:476:30940:28:18:71:540:396:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f19:C:Definition 1We say that affirmative action admission policy by the elite university leads to alocal

13:479:31164:28:18:71:540:332:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f4:C:Definition 2We  say  that  affirmative  action  admission  policy  by  the  elite  university  leads  to  a

13:487:31409:33:28:88:254:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Equivalently, (9) can be written as

13:489:31508:27:18:88:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Note thatT∗b(0) =T∗b≥0 regardless of whether the elite university has asymmetric information
13:490:31600:18:18:71:540:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about the students’ treatment effects.  Together with the fact thatT∗b(λ) is weakly decreasing in
13:491:31697:18:17:71:539:155:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:λ,we can conclude that a global mismatch is possible only ifT∗b(λ) is sufficiently negative.  Thus
13:492:31795:17:18:71:285:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:global mismatch must imply local mismatch.
13:493:31837:18:17:88:539:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Because both the local and global notions of mismatch require that the admission thresholds for
13:494:31932:17:18:71:540:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:blacks,T∗b(λ), to be sufficiently negative, and students with negative treatment effect will choose to
13:495:32034:18:0:71:539:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attend the elite university only when they are not fully knowledgeable about their treatment effect,
14:496:32136:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we conclude that anecessarycondition for mismatch to occur is that the elite university has private
14:497:32235:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information regarding the students’ treatment effect.  Combining the results from Propositions 1
14:498:32331:17:30:72:146:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 2, we have:

14:500:32438:17:18:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C:tive action admission policy is that the elite university has private information about the students’

14:504:32713:18:17:72:539:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decisions, anecessarycondition for either local mismatch or global mismatch to arise is that the elite
14:505:32815:17:18:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:university has private information about the students’ treatment effects.  In our empirical section,
14:506:32915:18:18:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we propose tests for private information by the elite university.  If our tests reject the presence of
14:507:33017:18:17:72:540:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:private information by the elite university, then we can conclude that mismatch does not arise as
14:508:33114:17:18:72:539:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:a result of affirmative action admission policies; however, if we detect private information, it isnot
14:509:33216:18:17:72:295:448:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:sufficientto establish that mismatch occurred.
14:510:33262:17:18:88:539:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this section, we describe data from the Campus Life and Learning Project (CLL) at Duke

14:512:33460:18:17:72:539:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:success of their students.12CLL is a multi-year prospective panel study of consecutive cohorts of
14:513:33557:17:18:72:539:378:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:students  enrolled  at  Duke  University  in  2001  and  2002  (graduating  classes  of  2005  and  2006).13
14:514:33665:18:17:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The target population of the CLL project included all undergraduate students in Duke’s Trinity

14:516:33860:18:18:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ethnic group from their Duke Admissions application form, the sampling design randomly selected
14:517:33955:18:17:72:540:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about 356 and 246 white students from the 2001 and 2002 cohorts respectively, all black and Latino
14:518:34053:17:18:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students, about two thirds of Asian students and about one third of Bi-Multiracial students in each
14:519:34152:18:18:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cohort.  The final design across both cohorts contains a total of 1536 students, including 602 white,
14:520:34253:18:17:72:381:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:290 Asian, 340 black, 237 Latino and 67 Bi-Multiracial students.
14:521:34317:17:18:88:539:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Each cohort was surveyed via mail in the summer before initial enrollment at Duke, in which
14:522:34408:18:17:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they were also asked to sign an informed consent document, as well as given option of providing

14:528:34976:11:18:80:539:118:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:13Duke is among the most selective national universities with about 6,000 undergraduate students. Duke’s accep-
14:529:35087:18:0:72:355:100:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:tance rate for its regular applications is typically less than 20 percent.

16:531:36348:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates declined in the years following enrollment with 71, 65 and 59 percent responding in the first,
16:532:36448:17:18:72:306:687:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:second and fourth years of college, respectively.15
16:533:36499:18:17:88:539:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The pre-college survey provides detailed measurement of the students’ social and family back-

16:535:36692:18:28:72:234:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In particular, students were asked
16:536:36726:28:17:99:512:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:“What do you realistically expect will be your cumulative GPA at Duke after your first
16:537:36812:17:28:99:130:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:year?”
16:538:36818:28:18:88:539:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We can then relate this measure to the student’s actual first year grade point average (GPA).The
16:539:36914:18:18:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in-college surveys contain data on social networks, performance attributions, choice of major, resi-

16:541:37093:17:18:88:539:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For those who released access to their institutional records, we also have information about their
16:542:37191:18:17:72:540:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grades, graduation outcomes, test scores (SAT and ACT) and financial aid and support.  Further,
16:543:37286:17:18:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we have the Duke Admission Officers’ rankings of their applications on six measures:  achievement,
16:544:37384:18:18:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:curriculum, essay, personal qualities, recommendations and test scores.  Each of these rankings are
16:545:37483:18:17:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reported on a five point scale.  It is these rankings coupled with student expected performance that
16:546:37583:17:18:72:540:420:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will be used to disentangle what the student knows from what the institution knows about how
16:547:37675:18:17:72:261:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well the student will perform in college.
16:548:37716:17:18:88:539:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 1 contains summary statistics for the key variables in the CLL data set by race.  The first
16:549:37813:18:18:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rows reveal that there is substantial amount of variation in entering credentials among students of
16:550:37912:18:17:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:difference races.  Asians and Whites tend to have higher evaluations by Duke Admission Officers in
16:551:38010:17:18:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all six categories than black and Latino students, with test score showing by far the largest gap.
16:552:38108:18:18:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Despite these differences in credentials, black and white students have quite similar expectations
16:553:38206:18:17:72:494:296:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:about their GPA during their first year in college (3.51 for whites and 3.44 for blacks).16
16:554:38297:17:18:88:539:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However,  Table  1  shows  that  there  is  a  significant  racial  difference  in  the  actual  first  year
16:555:38405:18:17:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cumulative GPAs.  The actual GPA for blacks is on average 2.90,  in contrast to that for whites
16:556:38500:17:18:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(3.33) and for Asians (3.40).  In fact at-test rejects the null hypothesis of equal means.  Notice
16:557:38598:18:18:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that, for all races, the students’ actual first year GPAs are on average lower than their expected
16:558:38696:18:17:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:GPAs.  This suggests that all students have over-optimistic expectations.  However, this optimism
16:559:38793:17:18:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bias is much stronger for black (0.54) and Latino (0.4) students than for white (0.18) and Asian
16:560:38889:18:17:71:451:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(0.27) students.  Again, at-test rejects the null hypothesis of equality of means.
16:561:38971:17:18:88:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Of course, part of the actual GPA differences across races are predicted by observable differences
16:562:39069:18:19:71:539:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:across  races  in  their  entering  credentials.   For  example,  Table  1  shows  Asians  and  whites  have

16:564:39278:15:15:80:376:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:15In the appendix we examine who attrits and test for non-repsonse bias.

17:566:39409:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantially higher (more than one standard deviation) SAT scores than Latino and black students.
17:567:39507:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Average family income for Black students tend to be lower than Asians and Latinos, which in turn
17:568:39603:17:18:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are lower than the whites. The parents of white students tend to have higher educational attainment
17:569:39702:18:17:72:130:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than blacks.
17:570:39714:17:18:88:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The key question is then,  why do the black and Latino students suffer a worse bias in their

17:573:39996:17:18:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dents form more realistic expectations?  If the black and Latino students were able to form more

17:575:40196:17:18:72:540:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their decisions to enroll at Duke?  These are the key empirical questions related to the mismatch

17:578:40329:28:18:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While  the  CLL  data  set  has  the  advantage  of  reporting  both  information  from  the  students
17:579:40431:18:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regarding their expected grades and information from Duke regarding the ranking of the applicant,
17:580:40528:17:18:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:disentangling Duke’s private information from what the student knows is challenging.  We begin by
17:581:40625:18:18:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:running some baseline regressions which mayboundthe amount of private information both the
17:582:40715:18:17:72:325:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student and Duke have about student’s performance.
17:583:40765:17:18:88:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We begin by examining the difference between the student’s expected GPA for their freshman
17:584:40855:18:18:72:539:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year,ExpGPA, and their actual cumulative GPA for their freshman year,GPA.17Specifically we
17:585:40945:18:17:71:539:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:see how forecastable this difference is with variables the student should know the effects of, such as
17:586:41047:17:18:71:540:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their race and SAT scores.  LetZindicate this set of variables.  We then add variables the student
17:587:41145:18:17:71:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:might only have partial information about such as Duke’s ranking of the student (DukeEv).  The
17:588:41239:17:29:71:237:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forecast error for studentiis then:

17:591:41334:28:18:71:256:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where the-’s are the projection errors.
17:592:41373:18:17:88:539:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Results from regressions (10) and (11) are reported in Table 2.18For ease of interpretation, we
17:593:41468:17:18:71:539:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:adjusted the SAT score such that it has zero mean and a standard deviation of one. Column 1 of Ta-
17:594:41566:18:19:71:539:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ble 2 shows that students underestimate the relationship between their SAT score and performance.
17:595:41663:19:18:80:540:152:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:17In  our  data,   the  correlation  between  student’s  actual  cumulative  GPA  (GPA)and  their  expected  GPA
17:596:41775:18:12:72:265:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:(ExpGPA)at the end of their first year is 0.178.
17:597:41823:12:18:80:539:122:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:18We have also experimented with specifications that include high school characteristics (private, public, religious
17:598:41939:18:14:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:etc.)  in the regressions.  Their coefficients are not significant and they neither affect the other coefficient estimates,
17:599:42062:14:0:72:276:90:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:nor significantly increase theR2of the regressions.

18:636:42662:17:33:71:500:376:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:in the Appendix.  *, ** and *** indicate that the coefficient is significant at 10%, 5% and 1% respectively.
18:637:42770:33:18:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Virtually all groups on average over-predict their performance, with the one exception being white
18:638:42868:18:17:71:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:females with SAT scores more than one standard deviation above the mean.  As expected given
18:639:42959:17:18:71:539:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the descriptive statistics in Table 1, blacks significantly overestimate their performance relative to
18:640:43061:18:17:71:539:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:the other racial groups.  Further, the variance of (GPA-ExpGPA) is 0.27 and is actuallyhigher
18:641:43154:17:18:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than the variance of first year GPA, which is 0.22.  Clearly if we assume that the student’s only
18:642:43251:18:18:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information about their future performance is captured in their expected GPA, then there is a lot
18:643:43348:18:17:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of information that the university possesses and a significant amount of noise in expected GPA.
18:644:43443:17:18:72:540:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, the statistically significant coefficient estimates on the Adjusted SAT and race variables
18:645:43543:18:17:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicates that the student does not accurately know how these characteristics translate into their
18:646:43641:17:18:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:future performance.  Duke, however, is likely to know more accurately about the relationship be-
18:647:43737:18:18:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tween characteristics and performance.  Column 2 in Table 2 adds controls for Duke’s evaluation
18:648:43832:18:17:72:539:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rankings of the students.  TheR2increases from 0.088 to 0.148 when we include Duke’s rankings,
18:649:43926:17:18:71:539:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:again suggesting that Duke has either private information about the student’s future performance
18:650:44022:18:19:71:535:114:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:or in how information known to both the student and Duke translates into future performance.19
18:651:44116:19:0:80:486:95:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:19The coefficients on the Duke evaluation ranking variables are given in Table A.1 in the Appendix .
19:652:44218:0:18:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  expected  GPA  of  the  student,  however,  may  not  reflect  the  student’s  true  information
19:653:44319:18:17:72:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:set.  We now test whether the university has private information under a more restrictive setting.
19:654:44417:17:18:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Namely,  we  assume  students  know  how  their  SAT  scores  and  other  demographics  translate  into
19:655:44520:18:17:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:future  performance.   The  information  set  for  both  the  student  and  the  university  then  contains
19:656:44627:17:18:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this common observed information plus common information that is unobserved to the researcher.
19:657:44721:18:29:72:304:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Under these assumptions, running the regression
19:658:44768:29:28:258:539:605:11:g_d0_f21:11:g_d0_f2:A:GPAi=Ziα3+-i3,(12)
19:659:44786:28:18:72:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and calculating theR2then leads to a lower bound on the amount of common information that the
19:660:44879:18:17:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student and the university have regarding the student’s future performance as it does not include
19:661:44976:17:18:72:539:542:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:common unobserved information.  Results from this regression are reported Column 1 of Table 3.20
19:662:45072:18:18:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Close to 19 percent of the variation in grades can be explained by these observables.  Comparing
19:663:45168:18:17:72:540:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this result with that in Column 1 of Table 1 suggests that students underestimate the relationship
19:664:45266:17:18:72:375:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between SAT scores and performance by more than 50 percent.
19:665:45325:18:28:88:394:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To this baseline regression, we add the student’s expected GPA:
19:666:45388:28:29:221:539:443:11:g_d0_f21:11:g_d0_f2:A:GPAi=Ziα4+ExpGPAiδ4+-i4.(13)
19:667:45416:29:18:71:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The difference inR2between (12) and (13) should provide anupperbound on the student’s private
19:668:45509:18:17:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information as it includes not only the student’s private information, but also common unobserved
19:669:45606:17:18:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information  that  is  correlated  with  student’s  private  information.   These  results  are  reported  in
19:670:45715:18:17:71:539:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Column 2 of Table 3.  The differences inR2between Column 2 and Column 1 in Table 3 indicates
19:671:45807:17:18:71:540:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that including the expected GPA of the student increases theR2by less than 0.01, which provides
19:672:45902:18:18:71:394:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an upper bound of the importance of student’s private information.
19:673:45968:18:28:88:371:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we add Duke’s evaluation rankings of the students:
19:674:46027:28:29:185:539:280:11:g_d0_f21:11:g_d0_f2:A:GPAi=Ziα5+ExpGPAiδ5+DukeEviβ5+-i5.(14)
19:675:46065:29:17:71:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The difference inR2between (13) and (14) should provide alowerbound on the importance of
19:676:46153:17:18:71:539:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Duke’s private information.  Notice from Column 3 that controlling for Duke’s rankings increase
19:677:46248:18:18:71:539:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:theR2by more than 0.12, again suggesting substantial Duke private information.21Note that this
19:678:46342:18:17:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:still leaves two-thirds of the variation in GPA unexplained,  perhaps due to course selection and
19:679:46439:17:19:71:292:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shocks to how students respond to college life.
19:680:46486:19:19:80:539:162:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:20Adding additional variables such as family income and mother’s education had little effect on theR2but did
19:681:46594:19:11:72:162:143:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:lead to some attrition.

21:739:47694:0:18:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A drawback of this empirical strategy is that we do not fully observe common information; as

21:747:48337:29:17:88:539:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There is a large existing economics literature that tests for asymmetric information particularly
21:748:48434:17:18:72:540:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for adverse selection in the empirical analysis of a variety of insurance markets.22Most of these
21:749:48531:18:18:72:539:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:papers test whether the data supports a positive association between insurance coverage andex

21:751:48721:17:18:72:456:478:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:Arrow (1963), Pauly (1974), Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977).23
21:752:48800:18:17:88:539:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our setting substantially differs from the insurance market setting studied in the existing liter-
21:753:48898:17:18:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ature.  The empirical insurance literature assumes that private information is possessed by one-side
21:754:48998:18:18:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  market,  the  potential  insured,  and  it  is  manifested  through  their  insurance  purchase  and
21:755:49107:18:17:72:539:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:theirex  postrisk occurrence.  In our setting,  there is presumably private information about the
21:756:49204:17:18:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment  effect  by  both  the  student  and  the  university.   Moreover,  the  empirical  insurance  lit-
21:757:49313:18:18:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:erature typically assumes either to have access to observations for individuals with and without
21:758:49409:18:17:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:insurance and their risk realizations, or to have access to observations for individuals with different
21:759:49512:17:18:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amount of coverage and their risk realizations.  In particular, the risk realization may be related to
21:760:49614:18:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:insurance coverage due to moral hazard, but will be unrelated to which insurance company provides
21:761:49711:17:18:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the coverage.  In our setting, if a student does not attend the elite university, we will not observe
21:762:49812:18:18:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the student’s outcome had he attended it; or if the student attends the elite university, we will not
21:763:49913:18:17:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observe the student’s outcome had he not attended.  For these reasons, we describe below a new

22:798:52518:25:29:88:420:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We propose an empirical strategy that consists of the following steps:
22:799:52588:29:18:85:540:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:1.  Invoking  Kotlarski’s  (1967)  theorem,  we  separately  recover  the  marginal  distributions  of
22:800:52690:18:27:99:418:165:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:A:XC,XUandXSfrom the observed joint distribution of (WU,WS) ;
22:801:52749:27:17:85:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:2.  We draw random samples of{XCi,XUi,XSi}from the marginal distributions ofXC,XUand
22:802:52833:17:20:99:211:121:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:A:XSrecovered in step 1;
22:803:52855:20:0:80:485:101:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:24We will describe in Subsection 6.3 below the empirical counterparts ofWUandWSin our setting.
23:804:52951:0:18:85:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:3.  We obtain samples of{WUi,WSi}from the random samples of{XCi,XUi,XSi}generated in
23:805:53035:18:17:99:540:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:step two, and then recover a sample ofYiconditional on{WUi,WSi}using multiple imputation
23:806:53123:17:27:99:150:687:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:A:methods.25
23:807:53133:27:17:85:540:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:4.  We run regressions ofYonXC,XU,XSusing the pseudo-sample{Yi,XCi,XUi,XSi}simu-
23:808:53213:17:30:99:453:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:lated above to estimateγC,γUandγS,and to do variance decomposition.
23:809:53280:30:18:88:539:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Now we provide more details about the above empirical strategy.  The key is the first step which
23:810:53376:18:29:71:366:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uses a mathematical result known as the Kotlarski’s theorem:
23:811:53436:29:18:71:540:566:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f4:C:Theorem 1(Kotlarski’s Theorem)LetXC,XUandXSbe three independent real-valued ran-
23:812:53516:18:17:71:540:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C:dom variables.  SupposeWUandWSare generated as in (16) and (17).  Then the joint distribution
23:813:53609:17:18:71:539:531:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C:of(WU,WS)determines the marginal distribution ofXC,XU,XSup to a change of the location as
23:814:53698:18:18:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C:long as the characteristic function of(WU,WS)does not vanish (i.e., it does not turn into zero on
23:815:53795:18:29:72:264:495:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C:any non-empty interval of the real line).
23:816:53836:29:18:88:539:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This well-known theorem is first proved in Kotlarski (1967) and the proof can also be found in
23:817:53930:18:17:72:539:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Rao (1992, pp 7-8).26The proof of the theorem also suggests how the marginal distributions for
23:818:54024:17:29:72:266:431:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:XC,XSandXUcan be constructed.  Let

23:844:54577:15:18:80:539:143:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:26Kotlarski theorem has been widely used in measurement error models in econometrics (e.g., Li and Vuong 1998).
23:845:54688:18:14:72:540:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:It  has  been  applied  elsewhere  in  economics,  e.g.   Krasnokutskaya  (2008)  used  in  the  context  of  identifying  and
23:846:54814:14:15:72:540:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:estimating auction models with unobserved auction heterogeneity, and Cunha, Heckman and Navarro (2005) used it
23:847:54924:15:0:72:409:96:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:to distinguish uncertainty from heterogeneity in their analysis of life-cycle earnings.
24:848:55013:0:18:72:540:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally the characteristic functions of these three random variables uniquely determines the prob-

24:886:55917:33:17:71:540:407:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f2:B:Remarks.We have assumed in equation (15) that the student outcomeYis a linear function

25:913:57918:24:17:71:539:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This specification implies that students have an accurate idea about how to weight each informa-

25:919:58470:18:17:88:545:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Applying Kotlarski’s decomposition to{WU,WS}allow us to recover a sample of{XCi,XUi,XSi},
25:920:58559:17:18:71:539:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and to construct a sample of{WUi,WSi}.  The next step is to obtain a sample of grades (i.e.Yi)

25:922:58734:17:18:88:539:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Once we haveYiand{XCi,XUi,XSi},we perform a variance decomposition analysis (keeping
25:923:58818:18:18:71:539:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in mind thatXCi,XUi,XSiare orthogonal to each other) to establish the contributions of Duke
25:924:58909:18:17:71:416:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f21:B:and students private and common information to the variation inGPA.
25:925:58976:17:18:88:539:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 4 reports the variance decomposition ofGPAfollowing two different specifications for
25:926:59066:18:17:71:540:306:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:WSas described above.  Specification (1) assumes that students know how to weight the available
25:927:59161:17:18:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information  when  they  predict  their  performance;  results  show  that  Duke’s  private  information
25:928:59265:18:18:71:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explains  9.1  percent  of  the  variance  in  the  students’  actual  first  year  cumulativeGPA;  the  stu-
25:929:59374:18:19:71:539:253:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dent’s private information explains no more than 0.05 percent and the common information 26.5
25:930:59467:19:16:80:540:234:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:28The basic steps of Rubin multiple imputation are as follows.  (1).  CalculateV= (W′W)−1,̂β=V W′Yand
25:931:59568:16:16:73:539:218:9:g_d0_f24:9:g_d0_f6:F:̂Y=W′̂βwhereW={WU,WS}; (2).  Draw a randomgfromχ2distribution with degree of freedomnobs−r; (3).

25:933:59766:14:15:72:540:188:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:identity matrix of orderr; (5).  Calculatêβ∗=̂β+σV1/2D,whereV1/2is the triangular square root ofVobtained
25:934:59872:15:14:72:540:173:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:by the Cholesky decomposition;  (6).  Calculate predicted valueŝYi=W′îβ∗; (7).  For each missing value find the
25:935:59985:14:11:72:539:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:respondent whosêYis closest tôYiand takeYof this respondent as the imputed value (predictive mean matching).
25:936:60095:11:18:80:540:148:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:29In  order  to  test  for  robustness  of  the  results  we  also  implemented  a  nonparametric  approach  to  recoverYi.
25:937:60218:18:15:72:540:130:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f16:F:Basically, we draw a sample ofZiconditional on{WUi,WSi}from the observed conditional distributionG(Y|WU,WS),
25:938:60326:15:14:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:which was obtained using the Epanechnikov kernel (K(u) =34(1−u2)1(|u|≤1)).  The smoothing parameter was selected
25:939:60438:14:14:72:540:101:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:by following a refined plug in method, which tries to find the bandwidth that minimizes the mean integrated square
25:940:60552:14:0:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:error.  Results obtained using this strategy did not differ significantly from those using multiple imputation technique.

26:952:61225:18:17:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consequence, the fraction of the variance inGPAexplained by Duke private information increases
26:953:61319:17:18:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to 23.5 percent, that by common information declines to 8.1 percent, but the fraction explained by
26:954:61417:18:18:72:335:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:student private information remains about 0.1 percent.
26:955:61471:18:17:88:539:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:It  is  worth  noting  the  changes  inR2depending  on  the  specification.   First  the  totalR2in
26:956:61570:17:18:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specification  (2)  is  smaller  than  in  specification  (1),  this  could  be  due  to  the  loss  of  valuable
26:957:61683:18:17:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information  when  students  do  not  correctly  weight  the  available  information  or  it  could  be  due
26:958:61791:17:18:72:540:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to students reporting expected GPA with error.  Second, there is an important change, similar in
26:959:61887:18:18:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:magnitudes but in opposite directions, of the proportion of the variance that could be explain by
26:960:61984:18:17:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:common information and duke private information.  This seems to suggest that the size of Duke
26:961:62077:17:18:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:private information not only depends on what information is not available to the students, but also
26:962:62176:18:17:72:511:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:how they weigh the information available to them in forecasting their performance at Duke.
26:963:62266:17:18:88:539:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Assuming  that  students  are  rational  implies  that  coefficient  on  students  private  information
26:964:62369:18:18:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:should  be  equal  one;  however  as  we  can  see  from  Table  4,  this  is  not  the  case.   One  possible
26:965:62479:18:17:72:540:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explanation to this discrepancy is that students may report with error their expected GPA. The
26:966:62573:17:18:72:539:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:attenuation bias from the measurement error might drive the smallR2we found for the students
26:967:62665:18:18:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:private  information  reported  in  Table  4.   However,  if  we  assume  that  the  discrepancy  between
26:968:62770:18:17:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimated  ˆγSand  the  postulated  valueγS=  1  under  rational  expectations  is  completely  due
26:969:62869:17:18:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  measurement  error,  we  can  easily  provide  an  estimate  of  the  variance  of  the  student  private
26:970:62978:18:17:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information without measurement error. To see this, note that in the case of orthogonal explanatory
26:971:63077:17:26:72:317:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variables with classical errors-in-variables, we have:
26:972:63131:26:0:263:301:129:11:g_d0_f14:8:g_d0_f9:C:̂γS=γS
26:973:63137:0:15:303:344:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Var(X∗S)
26:974:63145:15:0:303:344:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Var(XS)
26:975:63152:0:26:345:348:129:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:C:,
26:976:63153:26:18:72:540:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where Var(X∗S) is the variance of the student private information when it is purged of measurement
26:977:63251:18:0:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error,  and  Var(XS)  isX∗Smeasured  with  error.   Given  that  we  know  ˆγS,γS(which  is  equal  1
27:978:63354:0:18:72:539:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:under the rational expectation assumption) and Var(XS),then Var(X∗S) =̂γSVar(XS).Thus the
27:979:63443:18:17:72:539:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fraction  of  the  variation  inGPAexplained  byX∗S,  denoted  byR2∗,is  simply  theR2reported
27:980:63537:17:18:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Table 4 divided bŷγS.Therefore,  once we correct for measurement error,  the fraction of the
27:981:63633:18:17:72:539:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation in GPA that is explained by student private information measured without error (i.e.X∗S)
27:982:63731:17:18:72:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f10:B:under  specifications  (1)  and  (2)  are  respectively  equal  to  0.006  (≈0.0004/0.066)  and  0.0135  (≈
27:983:63838:18:18:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.0005/0.037);  again,  both  are  substantially  smaller  in  magnitude  than  the  private  information
27:984:63943:18:17:72:163:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possessed by Duke.
27:985:63961:17:18:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the results obtained in this section are quite similar to those obtained from the baseline
27:986:64060:18:17:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regressions.  Thus, the conclusion that Duke does possess private information that can predict the
27:987:64158:17:40:72:456:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:students’ post-enrollment performance is robust to different empirical strategies.
27:988:64240:40:29:72:170:524:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:7    Discussion
27:989:64255:29:17:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We  have  argued  that  for  affirmative  action  to  lead  to  mismatch  effect  in  the  sense  that  its
27:990:64362:17:18:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intended  beneficiary  may  be  made  worse  off,  a  necessary  condition  is  that  the  selective  univer-
27:991:64471:18:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sity has private information about the student’s treatment effect.  However, even though we have
27:992:64567:17:18:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shown substantial evidence that Duke does possess private information about the student’s future
27:993:64663:18:18:72:349:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performance, we can not conclude that there is mismatch.
27:994:64719:18:17:88:539:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We would also like to propose two potential avenues that may lead to a more conclusive test of
27:995:64813:17:18:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mismatch.  The first potential avenue requires the cooperation of the selective university’s Admis-
27:996:64912:18:18:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sion’s Office.  After the admission decisions are made, the Admissions Officer could randomly assign
27:997:65012:18:17:72:540:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:admitted minority students into two groups:  the first group will receive the standard admission
27:998:65108:17:18:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:letter;  and  the  second  group  will  receive  the  standard  admission  letter  together  with  additional
27:999:65217:18:17:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:information (e.g.  the Admissions Officer’s evaluation rankings of the applicant) that the Admis-
27:1000:65314:17:18:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sions Officer thinks are relevant to predict the applicants’ post-enrollment performance.  Then if
27:1001:65412:18:18:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we observe that the enrollment rate for the second group is smaller than the first group, this will
27:1002:65511:18:17:72:445:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prove that the university’s private information may have generated mismatch.
27:1003:65587:17:30:88:539:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The second potential avenue to test for mismatch is to ask the admitted students two questions:
27:1004:65682:30:17:99:513:219:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f2:A:Q1.“What do you realistically expect will be your cumulative GPA at Duke after your
27:1005:65765:17:22:99:152:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:first year?”
27:1006:65777:22:30:99:513:180:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f2:A:Q2.“Suppose your expected GPA at Duke was X. Would you still have chosen Duke?”
27:1007:65856:30:18:88:539:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If a researcher with access to the Admission Officer’s private information would have predicted
27:1008:65951:18:17:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a student’s cumulative GPA to be lower than the stated threshold by the student in Q2, we could
27:1009:66046:17:17:72:258:115:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:also conclude that there is mismatch.30
27:1010:66085:17:0:80:464:98:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:30Note that in both cases we would be testing for local mismatch rather than global mismatch.
28:1011:66180:0:18:88:539:722:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  even  if  one  cannot  conclusively  prove  the  existence  of  mis-
28:1012:66287:18:17:72:539:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:match, evidence that a selective university possesses valuableex  anteinformation could be used

28:1014:66479:18:17:72:540:669:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concerned about potential mismatch, it suggests that releasing more information to their applicants
28:1015:66578:17:18:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about how the admission officers feel about their fit with the university will minimize possibilities
28:1016:66679:18:18:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for actual mismatch.  More transparency and more effective communication with the students, and
28:1017:66774:18:17:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possibly pre-enrollment sit-ins in college classrooms etc.  can help minority students enrolling in an

28:1019:66961:40:28:72:173:559:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:8    Conclusion
28:1020:66976:28:18:88:539:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We argue that once we take into account the students’ rational enrollment decisions, mismatch
28:1021:67069:18:18:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the sense that the intended beneficiary of affirmative action admission policies are made worse off
28:1022:67171:18:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:could occur only if selective universities possess private information about students’ post-enrollment
28:1023:67273:17:18:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treatment effects.  This necessary condition for mismatch provides the basis for a new test.  We
28:1024:67369:18:17:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:propose  an  empirical  methodology  to  test  for  private  information  in  such  a  setting.   The  test  is
28:1025:67480:17:18:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implemented using data from Campus Life and Learning Project (CLL) at Duke.  The evidence
28:1026:67569:18:18:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows  that  Duke  does  possess  private  information  that  is  a  statistically  significant  predictor  of
28:1027:67679:18:17:72:540:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the students’ post-enrollment academic performance.  We also propose strategies to evaluate more
28:1028:67775:17:0:72:492:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conclusively whether the evidence of Duke private information has generated mismatch.

29:1033:68073:28:18:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Registrar’s Office data provided information on students who were not enrolled at the end

29:1037:68460:18:17:71:539:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were not enrolled at the end of the first year; about three percent by the end of the second year
29:1038:68557:17:18:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(n= 48) and just over five percent (n= 81) by the end of the senior year.  We combined all of
29:1039:68650:18:18:71:539:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these  reasons  and  tested  for  differences  in  selected  admissions  file  information  of  those  enrolled
29:1040:68761:18:17:71:539:483:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:versus not enrolled at the end of each survey year.  The test variables included racial ethnic group,

29:1044:69162:18:18:71:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:produced  significant  differences  (withp-value  less  than  0.05):  (1).   At  the  end  of  the  first  year,
29:1045:69274:18:17:71:539:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dropouts had SAT-verbal scores of 734 versus 680 for non-dropouts; (2).  by the end of the fourth
29:1046:69371:17:18:71:539:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:year,  those who had left college had an overall admissions rating of 46.0 (on a 0-60 scale) while
29:1047:69469:18:17:71:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:those in college had an average rating of 49.7.  No other differences were significant.  We conclude
29:1048:69569:17:18:71:294:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that our data contain very little drop-out bias.
29:1049:69617:18:18:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We conducted similar tests for respondents versus non-respondents for each wave for the same

29:1052:69904:18:18:71:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:previous to the survey semester.  Seven variables show no significant differences or only a few small

29:1055:70203:18:29:71:305:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other variables show more systematic differences:

29:1058:70444:18:26:99:217:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:of a standard deviation).
29:1059:70469:26:18:88:540:128:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•Non-respondents have slightly better educated parents at waves one and three, but not waves
29:1060:70561:18:0:99:163:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:two and four.
30:1061:70576:0:18:88:540:722:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•Non-respondents at every wave are less likely to be from a public high school and somewhat
30:1062:70667:18:26:99:384:704:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:more likely to be from a private (non-religious) high school.
30:1063:70728:26:18:88:540:678:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f2:A:•Non-respondents have somewhat lower GPA in the previous semester compared with respon-
30:1064:70815:18:29:99:321:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:dents (by about one-quarter of a letter grade).
30:1065:70862:29:18:88:539:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These differences are somewhat inconsistent in that they include lower SAT and GPA for non-
30:1066:70953:18:18:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respondents, but higher parental education and private (more expensive) high schools.  In general,
30:1067:71051:18:17:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the non-response bias is largest in the pre-college wave and smaller in the in-college waves even
30:1068:71148:17:18:72:540:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:though the largest response rates are in the pre-college wave.  In general, we judge the non-response
30:1069:71249:18:40:72:461:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bias as relatively minor on most variables and perhaps modest on SAT measures.
