2:31:1775:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  combine  data  on  trade,  production,  and  input  use  to  document  changes  in  the  value  added 
2:32:1881:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:content of  trade  between  1970  and  2009.    The  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports  fell  by 
2:33:1986:14:14:71:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:roughly   10   percentage points   worldwide.      The   ratio   declined   20   percentage   points   in 
2:34:2091:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:manufacturing, but rose in non-manufacturing sectors.  Declines also differ across countries and 
2:35:2187:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:trade  partners:  they  are  larger  for  fast  growing  countries, for  nearby  trade  partners,  and  among 
2:36:2296:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:partners that adopt regional trade agreements.  Using a multi-sector structural gravity model with 
2:37:2394:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:input-output linkages, we show that changes in trade frictions play a dominant role in explaining 
2:38:2491:14:42:72:140:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:all these facts.

3:51:2757:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Recent decades have seen the emergence of global supply chains. Echoing Feenstra (1998),
3:52:2845:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rising  trade  integration  has  coincided  with  the  simultaneous  disintegration  of  production
3:53:2944:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across  borders.1As  inputs  pass  through  these  global  supply  chains,  they  typically  cross
3:54:3042:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:borders multiple times. Since the national accounts record gross shipments across the border,
3:55:3135:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not  the  locations  at  which  value  is  added  at  different  stages  of  the  production  process,
3:56:3237:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conventional trade data obscure how value added – and the primary factors embodied therein
3:57:3327:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:– is traded in the global economy.  This means that gross trade data alone are not sufficient to
3:58:3423:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:isolate the causes or interpret the consequences of the massive changes in the global economy
3:59:3516:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that have occurred in recent decades.  We need to pierce the veil of the gross flows to analyze
3:60:3611:18:18:71:278:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in trade in value added directly.
3:61:3652:18:18:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This paper computes and analyzes the value added content of trade over the last four
3:62:3736:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decades (1970-2009). In doing so, we make three contributions. First, we provide long horizon
3:63:3829:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures of value-added trade for a wide cross section of countries.  Second, we document
3:64:3918:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:five stylized facts about changes in value-added and gross trade at the world, country, and
3:65:4009:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bilateral level over time.  We show that the value added content of trade has declined for
3:66:4099:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  world  as  a  whole,  that  there  is  substantial  heterogeneity  in  declines  across  countries,
3:67:4203:18:18:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  that  regional  trade  agreements  lower  value-added  relative  to  gross  trade.   Third,  we
3:68:4303:18:18:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:use a trade model with input-output linkages across sectors and countries to quantify the
3:69:4392:18:18:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:role  of  international  trade  frictions  in  explaining  the  divergence  between  value-added  and
3:70:4493:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gross  trade  over  time.   We  show  that  changes  in  trade  frictions,  particularly  frictions  for
3:71:4597:18:18:71:440:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufactured inputs, play a key role in explaining all five stylized facts.
3:72:4672:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To  track  value-added  trade  over  time,  we  combine  time  series  data  on  trade,  produc-
3:73:4768:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion, and input use to construct an annual sequence of global bilateral input-output tables
3:74:4859:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:covering forty-two countries back to 1970.  These synthetic tables track shipments of final
3:75:4950:18:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and intermediate goods both within and between countries.  Using this framework, we com-
3:76:5038:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pute value-added exports:  the amount of value added from a given source country that is
3:77:5126:18:17:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consumed in each destination (i.e.,  embodied in final goods absorbed in that destination)
3:78:5216:17:18:71:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:[Johnson  and  Noguera  (2012a)].   Value-added  exports  measure  international  transactions
3:79:5310:18:18:71:539:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a manner consistent with commonly used value-added representations of production and
3:80:5397:18:18:71:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:preferences.2They differ from gross exports for several distinct reasons: exports are typically
3:81:5492:18:18:71:539:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:produced using imported inputs, some exported inputs return home embodied in imports,
3:82:5577:18:18:71:539:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and exported inputs often are processed in third countries before being shipped onto their
3:83:5667:18:16:85:539:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1This theme is reflected in work on vertical specialization, offshoring, and global value chains [Feenstra
3:84:5773:16:8:72:471:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Hanson (1999), Yi (2003, 2010), Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), Antr`as (2016)].
3:85:5861:8:16:85:539:110:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:2On the production side, value-added exports are explicitly comparable to GDP. On the demand side,
3:86:5959:16:11:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:value-added imports equal final expenditure on value added from foreign sources, regardless of whether that
3:87:6066:11:0:72:340:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:value-added is embodied in domestic or imported final goods.
4:88:6127:0:18:72:158:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:final destination.
4:89:6145:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This  data  work  builds  on  and  extends  an  active  literature  on  global  input-output  ac-
4:90:6242:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:counting and trade in value added.3Our data construction effort is distinguished from this
4:91:6332:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related  work  in  that  we  provide  a  long  historical  perspective  on  the  rise  of  global  supply
4:92:6437:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:chains, with broad country scope.  In this, our work extends the pioneering long run analysis
4:93:6530:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of vertical specialization by Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001), who measured the import content
4:94:6621:18:18:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of exports for ten OECD countries from 1970 to 1990.4The data that we compile span a
4:95:6705:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:period  of  major  structural  changes  in  the  global  economy,  including  the  rise  of  emerging
4:96:6806:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markets, the (re-)integration of Europe, and the spread of regional trade agreements.  The
4:97:6896:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:long panel dimension of our data is essential to credibly identify the impact of these events.
4:98:6990:18:18:89:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We  summarize  the  most  significant  changes  in  value-added  versus  gross  trade  via  five
4:99:7086:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stylized facts.  The first fact is that the ratio of value-added to gross exports is declining over
4:100:7185:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time, by about ten percentage points over four decades [Fact 1].  Consistent with anecdotal
4:101:7276:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evidence, this decline has accelerated over time: the ratio of value-added to gross exports has
4:102:7371:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fallen roughly three times as fast since 1990 as it did from 1970 to 1990.  This global decline
4:103:7466:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:masks  significant  heterogeneity  across  sectors,  countries,  and  bilateral  partners.   Across
4:104:7565:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sectors,  the  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports  has  fallen  by  almost  twenty  percentage
4:105:7667:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points within manufacturing, but has risen outside manufacturing [Fact 2].  Across countries,
4:106:7760:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declines in value-added to gross exports range from near zero to over twenty-five percentage
4:107:7852:18:18:72:479:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:points, and fast growing countries have seen larger declines on average [Fact 3].
4:108:7933:18:18:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Across bilateral partners, we show that both bilateral distance and adoption of bilateral
4:109:8022:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade agreements predict changes in value-added to gross export ratios.  In the time series,
4:110:8114:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance is negatively correlated with changes in the bilateral ratio of value-added to gross
4:111:8207:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exports, so that the largest declines in value-added to export ratios are concentrated among
4:112:8299:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proximate trading partners [Fact 4].  We also find that adoption of regional trade agreements
4:113:8392:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(RTAs) is associated with declines in the ratio of bilateral value-added to gross exports [Fact
4:114:8487:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:5].  For a typical agreement, the ratio of value-added to gross trade falls by five to eleven
4:115:8580:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:percent.   Further,  deep  trade  agreements  (e.g.,  customs  unions  or  common  markets)  are
4:116:8676:18:18:72:526:206:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:associated with larger declines in value-added to export ratios than shallow agreements.5
4:117:8765:18:18:89:539:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To isolate the driving forces underlying these changes, we interpret the five facts through

4:123:9265:8:16:85:539:104:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:5These findings contribute to an important literature on the impact of RTAs [Freund and Ornelas (2010)].
4:124:9369:16:11:71:539:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Despite the fact that many agreements were explicitly adopted to promote integration of supply chains across
4:125:9477:11:0:71:392:77:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:borders, existing evidence on whether or how they have done so is scarce.
5:126:9551:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ages across sectors and countries.6There are two steps in this analysis.  First, we use our
5:127:9642:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:global  input-output  data,  together  with  auxiliary  data  on  prices  of  real  value  added  and
5:128:9743:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:final  expenditure,  to  measure  changes  international  trade  frictions  and  sectoral  expendi-
5:129:9842:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ture weights for final goods and inputs.  Conditional on prices, the trade frictions influence
5:130:9936:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bilateral sourcing decisions for final goods and intermediate inputs, the final and input ex-
5:131:10029:18:18:72:513:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:penditure weights govern the allocation of final and inputs expenditure across sectors.
5:132:10116:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we analyze counterfactual model simulations to evaluate the role of trade frictions
5:133:10207:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in explaining changes in value-added versus gross trade.7We show that declines in trade
5:134:10294:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions  over  time  play  an  important  role  in  explaining  all  five  stylized  facts  highlighted
5:135:10399:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:above.  Changes in other driving forces – including changes in productivity, factor supplies,
5:136:10492:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and sectoral expenditure weights – play a comparatively minor role.  Among trade frictions,
5:137:10583:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declines  in  frictions  for  manufacturing  goods,  particularly  manufactured  inputs,  are  most
5:138:10682:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:important  for  matching  the  data.   We  also  show  that  declines  in  bilateral  trade  frictions
5:139:10784:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:associated  with  RTA  adoption  explain  changes  in  bilateral  value-added  to  export  ratios.
5:140:10882:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Moreover, the spread of RTAs over time can account for up to 15% of the global decline in
5:141:10971:18:18:72:252:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio of value-added to gross trade.
5:142:11007:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 1 outlines the procedure and data we use to mea-
5:143:11095:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sure value-added exports.  Section 2 documents five stylized facts about differences between
5:144:11187:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gross and value-added exports.  Section 3 presents the model, our quantification procedures,
5:145:11279:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and results on the role of trade frictions versus other forces in accounting for the five facts.
5:146:11375:18:45:72:484:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We analyze the role of trade frictions in detail in Section 4.  Section 5 concludes.

5:148:11506:30:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  begin  by  laying  out  the  global  input-output  framework  and  procedure  for  computing
5:149:11602:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added exports, drawing on Johnson and Noguera (2012a).  We then briefly discuss how
5:150:11691:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we combine sector-level production, input use, and trade data to implement the calculations,
5:151:11783:18:18:72:271:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with details provided in the Appendix.
5:152:11821:18:15:85:539:202:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:6Our model shares many similarities with recent multi-sector Ricardian models, which incorporate trade
5:153:11923:15:12:72:540:187:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:in both final and intermediate inputs [Caliendo and Parro (2015), Levchenko and Zhang (2016), Eaton et al.
5:154:12029:12:12:72:540:175:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:(2016)].  Though we rely on Armington rather than Ricardian micro-foundations for trade,  the aggregate
5:155:12132:12:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:response of value-added trade to frictions would be similar in both models.  In contrast to recent Ricardian
5:156:12240:12:12:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:models, we allow differences in trade costs for final and intermediate goods to match imports of final and
5:157:12346:12:8:72:287:139:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:intermediate goods separately within each sector.
5:158:12395:8:16:85:539:131:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:7Our long horizon analysis complements Eaton et al. (2016), who examine high frequency (business cycle)
5:159:12498:16:12:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:variation in trade frictions.  Our results on the impact of regional trade agreements also complement Caliendo
5:160:12608:12:0:72:326:103:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Parro (2015), who study North American integration.

7:229:16842:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between commodity and industry classifications.  The result is a sector-level data set of cross-
7:230:16938:18:18:72:449:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country final and intermediate goods shipments from 1970 to the present.
7:231:17010:18:18:89:539:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We turn to input-output tables for additional information on input use and sector-level fi-
7:232:17101:18:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nal expenditure.  We take data for benchmark years from the OECD Input-Output Database
7:233:17187:17:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and IDE-JETRO Asian Input-Output Tables.  Input-output tables are available for all forty-

7:235:17368:18:18:72:470:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tries (the G7 plus Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands) from the 1970’s.
7:236:17444:18:18:89:539:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  combining  these  data,  we  face  two  challenges.   First,  there  are  discrepancies  across
7:237:17543:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:alternative data sources, both due to differences in definitions and measurement error.  Sec-
7:238:17636:18:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ond, whereas the national accounts and trade data are annual, the input-output tables are
7:239:17725:18:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:produced  for  benchmark  years  only,  which  are  asynchronous  across  countries.   To  resolve
7:240:17823:18:15:85:539:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:9The countries in our sample (listed in the Appendix) account for roughly 80% of world GDP and 70-80%
7:241:17924:15:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of world trade in the 1970-1990 period, rising to over 90% of GDP and 80-90% of world trade after 1990.
7:242:18027:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Due to lack of data, we include the Czech Republic, Estonia, Russia, Slovakia, and Slovenia in the rest of
7:243:18133:12:0:72:227:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the world during 1970’s and 1980’s.
8:244:18169:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these issues, we prioritize the national accounts data and adjust the commodity trade data
8:245:18259:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in order to match the levels of aggregate trade in the national accounts.  We then use a con-
8:246:18352:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:strained least squares procedure to simultaneously adjust the input-output data to match
8:247:18440:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the annual production and trade data and extrapolate benchmark data to non-benchmark

8:249:18530:18:18:89:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The result is a sector-level data set containing gross output (yit), value-added to output

8:252:18800:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(s={1,2,3}), we use observed bilateral final and intermediate import shares to splitfIit(s)

8:254:18985:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we assume that bilateral import shares for final and intermediate services are the same and
8:255:19076:18:45:72:412:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equal to the share of each partner in multilateral services imports.

8:257:19189:30:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Using the framework and data introduced above, we document five stylized time-series facts
8:258:19279:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regarding  changes  the  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports  over  time.   We  start  at  the
8:259:19380:17:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:multilateral  level,  documenting  changes  at  the  world,  sector,  and  country  level.   We  then
8:260:19481:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:examine  how  proxies  for  bilateral  trade  frictions  have  shaped  changes  in  bilateral  value-
8:261:19582:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added versus gross exports.  These serve as focal points in the model accounting analysis
8:262:19671:18:39:72:200:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that follows in Section 3.

8:264:19738:26:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We start at the global level, plotting the ratio of value-added exports to gross exports for
8:265:19830:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  world  as  a  whole  in  Figure  1.   The  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports  declines  by
8:266:19934:18:18:72:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.08 including the ROW and 0.09 excluding the ROW from 1970-2009.  Excluding the 2009
8:267:20019:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade collapse, the value-added to export ratio declines by 0.11 including the ROW and by
8:268:20108:18:18:72:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.13 excluding the ROW.11This decline is spread unevenly over time.  During the 1970-1989
8:269:20197:18:17:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interval, there is only a small net decline value added relative to gross exports, on the order
8:270:20292:17:16:81:539:174:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:10Because  we  do  not  have  production  or  input-output  data  for  countries  in  the  rest  of  the  world,  we
8:271:20408:16:12:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:assume that all exports from the forty-two countries in our data to the rest of the world are absorbed there.
8:272:20517:12:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:This assumption has little practical effect on measured value-added exports among countries in the sample
8:273:20622:12:8:72:210:134:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:[Johnson and Noguera (2012b)].
8:274:20652:8:16:81:539:126:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:11Bems, Johnson and Yi (2010) point to the composition of changes in final expenditure during the 2009
8:275:20754:16:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:recession to explain why value added rose relative to gross trade.  When spending on final goods from sectors
8:276:20863:12:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:with high degrees of vertical specialization (e.g., durable goods) falls, then the ratio of value-added to gross
8:277:20975:12:0:72:129:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:exports rises.
9:278:20990:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a few percentage points.  In contrast, value added relative to gross exports fall rapidly, by
9:279:21086:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:8.5 (9.5 excluding the ROW) percentage points from 1990-2008.  The decline in the value-
9:280:21174:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added to export ratio is roughly three times as fast during the 1990-2008 period as during
9:281:21264:18:18:72:175:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the pre-1990 period.
9:282:21284:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To drill down, we disaggregate these global trends along two dimensions, into changes in
9:283:21372:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added to export ratios at the sector level and across countries.  We plot sector-level
9:284:21464:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in Figure 2.  The headline result is that manufacturing is the only sector in which
9:285:21555:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the value-added to export ratio is falling over time.  The ratio is increasing for agriculture
9:286:21649:18:18:72:428:564:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:and services and stable in non-manufacturing industrial production.12
9:287:21718:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Figure 3, we plot changes in value-added to export ratios at the country level.  Panel
9:288:21807:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(a)  of  Figure  3  contains  cumulative  changes  in  the  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports
9:289:21909:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 1970-2008 at the country level.  Nearly all countries experienced declines in the ratio
9:290:22001:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of value-added to gross exports,  but the magnitude of the decline is heterogeneous across
9:291:22091:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries.   Most  experience  declines  larger  than  10  percentage  points,  though  some  large
9:292:22190:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and prominent countries (e.g.,  Japan,  the UK, and Brazil) have smaller declines.  Among
9:293:22279:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries  with  large  declines,  one  sees  many  emerging  markets,  but  also  some  important
9:294:22377:18:18:71:261:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:advanced economies (e.g., Germany).
9:295:22412:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To organize this cross-country variation, we plot the average annual change in the ratio
9:296:22500:18:18:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of value-added to gross exports against the average annual growth rate in real GDP in Panel
9:297:22591:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(b)  of  Figure  3.   The  correlation  is  negative  and  statistically  significant  at  the  1%  level.
9:298:22697:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Cumulated over four decades, the point estimate implies that a country at the 90thpercentile
9:299:22789:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the growth distribution (5.8% per year) has a decline in the ratio of roughly 0.21 while
9:300:22880:18:18:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  country  at  the  10thpercentile  (2.2%  per  year)  has  a  decline  of  0.11.   Because  emerging
9:301:22982:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:markets  on  average  have  higher  growth  than  advanced  countries,  this  also  reinforces  the
9:302:23081:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observation above that gross exports have risen more than value-added exports on average
9:303:23169:18:39:72:169:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for these countries.
9:304:23189:39:25:72:282:220:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:C:2.2    Bilateral Trade Frictions
9:305:23221:25:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Shifting  our  focus  to  bilateral  country  pairs,  we  describe  how  changes  in  bilateral  value-
9:306:23324:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added versus gross exports are shaped by bilateral trade frictions.  We focus on two common
9:307:23415:18:18:72:429:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proxies for bilateral frictions:  distance and regional trade agreements.
9:308:23488:18:16:81:539:141:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:12Note that the sector-level value-added to export ratio is not bounded by one.  The reason is that each
9:309:23592:16:11:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:sector can export value added directly,  embodied in gross exports from the sector,  or it can export value
9:310:23699:11:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:added indirectly, embodied in gross exports from other sectors.  For example, non-manufacturing inputs are
9:311:23805:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:used in production of manufactured goods, and hence non-manufacturing value added is indirectly exported
9:312:23909:12:0:72:190:90:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:embodied in manufactures.
10:313:23935:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:The Differential Burden of DistanceWe are interested in two main questions.  First,
10:314:24018:18:18:71:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:how do gross exports (xijt),  value-added exports (vaijt),  and value-added to export ratios
10:315:24110:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(V AXijt≡vaijtxijt) respond to bilateral distance?  Second, how have these responses changed
10:316:24202:18:18:72:125:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over time?
10:317:24212:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To  answer  these  questions,  we  estimate  gravity-style  regressions  for  each  of  the  three
10:318:24310:18:33:72:175:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variables of interest:
10:319:24332:33:33:200:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:log(yijt) =φyit+φyjt+βytlog(distij) +εijt,(3)
10:320:24377:33:18:72:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whereyijt∈ {xijt,vaijt,V AXijt}),{φyit,φyjt}are  importer-year  and  exporter-year  fixed  ef-

10:322:24569:17:18:72:539:517:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For interpretation, it is useful to note thatβV AX=βva−βxholds by construction, since
10:323:24654:18:18:72:256:499:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:log(V AXijt) = log(vaijt)−log(xijt).
10:324:24690:18:18:89:539:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The distance coefficients estimated in Equation (3) are plotted in Figure 4.13Looking at
10:325:24778:18:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the left panel, the ratio of value-added to gross exports is higher for more distant markets.
10:326:24871:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This  is  reflected  in  the  separate  distance  coefficients  for  gross  versus  value-added  exports
10:327:24975:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  the  right  panel.   While  distance  depresses  both,  gross  exports  fall  more  strongly  with
10:328:25077:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance  than  do  value-added  exports  –  i.e.,  the  absolute  value  of  the  distance  coefficient
10:329:25181:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on gross exports is larger than the coefficient on value-added exports in all years.  Further,
10:330:25275:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this differential impact of distance is strengthening over time.  The distance coefficient for
10:331:25369:18:18:72:539:355:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the value-added to export ratio has risen from under 0.1 to 0.2.  The reason is that distance
10:332:25462:18:34:72:539:337:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient for gross exports has risen (in absolute value) over time, from roughly 0.9 to 1.1.14
10:333:25559:34:18:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Regional Trade AgreementsWe now examine how value-added and gross exports re-
10:334:25636:18:18:72:345:285:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:spond to the adoption of regional trade agreements.15
10:335:25689:18:18:89:539:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To demonstrate the main result visually, we take an event study approach.  We compare
10:336:25774:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the evolution of the value-added to export ratio for the treatment group of bilateral country
10:337:25867:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pairs that form new RTA’s during our sample to outcomes for a pair-specific control group
10:338:25956:18:18:72:539:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a window surrounding adoption of the RTA. For country pair (i,j) that forms an RTA,
10:339:26042:18:16:81:539:195:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:13Very  small  bilateral  gross  trade  flows  are  often  lead  to  extreme  value-added  to  export  ratios,  which
10:340:26159:16:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:distort the point estimates and muddy inference.  These outliers are mostly for emerging markets with low
10:341:26264:12:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:quality data during the 1970-1985 period.  We remove them by dropping bilateral flows less than one million
10:342:26371:12:8:72:349:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:dollars and value-added to gross export ratios greater than ten.
10:343:26435:8:16:81:539:147:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:14In  the  Appendix,  we  show  that  changes  in  these  coefficients  are  robust  to  adding  additional  gravity
10:344:26551:16:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:controls (e.g., indicators for common language, border, and colonial origin) and country-pair fixed effects.
10:345:26659:12:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Further, distance stands out among gravity variables in terms of its ability to explain changes in the value-
10:346:26768:12:8:72:168:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:added to export ratio.
10:347:26790:8:16:81:539:99:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:15We  use  data  on  economic  integration  agreements  assembled  by  Scott  Baier  and  Jeffrey  Bergstrand,
10:348:26900:16:12:72:539:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:covering  the  1960-2009  period  [September  2015  Revision;http://www.nd.edu/~jbergstr/].   Our  RTA

11:352:27242:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We plot the resulting treatment and control series in Figure 5.  Prior to RTA adoption,
11:353:27329:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added to export ratios are quite similar across the treatment and control groups.  There
11:354:27423:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is then a strong divergence between the two, coinciding with adoption of the RTA: for pairs
11:355:27514:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that adopt an RTA, the value-added to export ratio drops sharply around the adoption date
11:356:27603:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and then continues to fall for roughly a decade thereafter.  This divergence is prima facie
11:357:27694:18:18:72:520:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evidence that trade agreements have different effects on gross versus value-added trade.
11:358:27782:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To formalize these results and control for confounding factors, we turn to panel regressions
11:359:27874:18:18:72:132:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the form:
11:360:27886:18:26:162:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:log(yijt) =φyit+φyjt+φyij+βyTradeAgreementijt+εyijt,(4)

11:363:28121:18:17:72:539:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:specifications forTradeAgreementijt.  The first uses a single indicator for whether countries
11:364:28214:17:18:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have an RTA in force, the second distinguishes “shallow” from “deep” agreements, and the
11:365:28302:18:18:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:third allows for phase-in effects.18We estimate this equation using data at five-year intervals
11:366:28397:18:18:72:360:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 1970 to 2009 (the 2005-2009 interval is four years).
11:367:28454:18:18:89:539:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Table 1 reports the estimation results.  We find that adoption of trade agreements low-
11:368:28541:18:18:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ers value-added relative to gross exports among countries in those agreements.  Using the
11:369:28630:18:18:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simple  binary  RTA  indicator  (RTAijt),  the  ratio  falls  by  about  5%  following  adoption  of
11:370:28730:18:18:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an agreement.  In columns 3 and 4, we split out the effects of different agreements.  While
11:371:28821:18:18:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:signing a preferential agreement has no impact on the ratio of value-added to gross exports,
11:372:28913:18:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adoption  of  an  FTA  lowers  the  ratio  of  value-added  to  gross  exports.   Further,  “deeper”
11:373:29013:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:CUCMEU agreements are associated with larger declines than FTAs.  Following adoption
11:374:29097:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of a CUCMEU, the ratio declines between 8-12%, whereas adoption of a FTA is associated
11:375:29183:18:19:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with a drop of 4-5%.  The response of gross and value-added trade flows to RTA adoption
11:376:29270:19:7:81:251:232:7:g_d0_f5:5:g_d0_f19:A:16Formally, defineTt(i,j) =vaijt+vajit
11:377:29308:7:10:214:539:225:7:g_d0_f18:10:g_d0_f6:F:xijt+xjitto be the bilateral value-added to export ratio for (i,j) pairs in
11:378:29383:10:14:72:539:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the treatment group.  Further, letK(i,j) denote the set of countries with whom bothiandjnever form
11:379:29481:14:0:72:203:201:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:an RTA, and defineCt(i,j) =

11:386:29812:8:16:81:539:167:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:17As discussed by Baier and Bergstrand (2007), the pair fixed effect accounts for endogenous adoption of
11:387:29916:16:11:71:539:151:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:agreements based on time-invariant characteristics of the bilateral pair.  In some specifications, we also add
11:388:30026:11:12:71:540:140:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:a pair-specific linear trend (δyijt), which controls for endogenous adoption based on trending characteristics.
11:389:30137:12:9:71:438:128:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:These controls also absorb pair-specific levels and trends in unmeasured trade costs.
11:390:30222:9:15:81:539:119:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:18In terms of depth,  we distinguish preferential trade agreements (PTA), free trade agreements (FTA),
11:391:30324:15:12:71:539:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and customs unions, common markets, and economic unions (CUCMEU). To allow for phase-in effects, we
11:392:30423:12:12:71:540:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:define a set of indicator variables:RTAijt(1) takes the value 1 in the RTA adoption year,RTAijt(2) equals
11:393:30528:12:0:71:530:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:1 in the 5th year,RTAijt(3) equals 1 in the tenth year, andRTAijt(4) equals 1 one for years 15 onward.
12:394:30632:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are reported in Panels B and C. Consistent with the changes in value-added to export ratios,
12:395:30724:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we find that gross exports rise more following the adoption of RTAs than do value-added
12:396:30811:18:18:72:351:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exports, with larger differences for “deep” agreements.
12:397:30866:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To quantify adjustment dynamics, we report the coefficients on RTA indicators for specific
12:398:30956:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periods post-RTA adoption in columns 5 and 6 of Table 1.  Consistent with the dynamics in
12:399:31045:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 5, the impact of RTA adoption appears to grow over time.19Upon adoption of the
12:400:31130:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:RTA, the ratio of value-added to gross exports falls by 3-5% and then continue to fall over
12:401:31221:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the duration of the agreement.  The total effect levels off at around 9-11%.  Value added and
12:402:31314:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gross exports follow similar adjustment dynamics, with value-added exports rising between
12:403:31403:18:39:72:405:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:28-39% and gross exports rising between 37-50% in the long run.
12:404:31466:39:25:72:347:507:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:C:2.3    Summing Up:  Five Stylized Facts
12:405:31505:25:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To  sum  up,  we  have  documented  five  stylized  facts.   The  first  is  that  the  ratio  of  world
12:406:31609:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added  to  gross  exports  has  fallen  over  time,  by  roughly  ten  percentage  points  and
12:407:31709:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mostly post-1990.  The second is that the ratio of value-added to gross exports has fallen for
12:408:31803:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing, but actually risen outside of manufacturing.  The third fact is that changes
12:409:31894:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have been heterogeneous across countries, with fast growing countries seeing larger declines
12:410:31986:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the ratio of their value-added to gross exports.  The fourth and fifth facts concern bilateral
12:411:32083:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes:  declines in value-added to export ratios have been larger for proximate partners
12:412:32173:18:45:72:372:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and country pairs that adopted regional trade agreements.
12:413:32230:45:30:72:478:311:17:g_d0_f8:17:g_d0_f8:C:3    What Driving Forces Account for the Facts?
12:414:32277:30:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we ask:  what driving forces account for the five stylized facts identified in
12:415:32372:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section 2?  Are they products of distinct driving forces, or do common driving forces account
12:416:32465:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for multiple facts simultaneously?  These questions are difficult to answer with data alone.
12:417:32557:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Many features of the global economy have changed over time, and these changes are linked
12:418:32645:18:18:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:together: any given candidate driving force (e.g., changes in productivity, endowments, trade
12:419:32738:18:17:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions, etc.)  leads to changes in multiple aspects of the input-output system.  Therefore,
12:420:32832:17:18:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we need a structural equilibrium framework to disentangle competing explanations for the
12:421:32920:18:18:72:141:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stylized facts.
12:422:32935:18:18:89:539:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We develop an Armington-style model with cross-sector and cross-country input-output
12:423:33019:18:16:81:539:120:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:19Adjustment dynamics may arise for several reasons.  First, trade agreements are typically phased in, so
12:424:33124:16:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:impact of the agreement may grows over time.  Second, it may take time for trade flows to respond to those
12:425:33230:12:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:changes.  Third, countries with weaker agreements may adopt stronger agreements at a later date, so the
12:426:33333:12:0:72:304:80:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:depth of liberalization evolves over time within pairs.
13:427:33390:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:linkages suited to this task.  The analysis then proceeds in two steps.  First, we use the model
13:428:33486:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as a measurement device.  While we are able to collect data on some driving forces (e.g.,
13:429:33575:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in factor inputs and productivity across countries), it is difficult to directly measure
13:430:33671:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:others.  Specifically, trade costs are difficult to measure in a comprehensive, consistent way
13:431:33765:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through time [Anderson and van Wincoop (2004)].  Changes in preferences and production
13:432:33851:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:technologies needed to match final and input expenditure across sectors are also unobserved.
13:433:33943:18:18:72:374:600:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, we combine the model and data to infer them.20

15:550:39860:18:18:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:B:σgoverns substitution between real value added and inputs, as well as across inputs from
15:551:39948:18:18:71:539:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different sectors.  We setσ=ρ=−1, corresponding to an elasticity of substitution equal
15:552:40034:18:18:71:539:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to 0.5.  This means that manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors are complements in
15:553:40121:18:18:71:539:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:final demand, and that value added and inputs, and inputs across sectors, are complements
15:554:40210:18:18:71:512:254:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:on the production side.  These assumptions are both supported by existing evidence.24
15:555:40295:18:18:89:540:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We  also  need  values  for  the  parameters{α,δit}and  the  exogenous  forcing  variables

15:561:40830:12:8:71:115:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:close to 4.
15:562:40841:8:16:81:539:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:24The low final expenditure elasticity is consistent with the fact that both the share of non-manufacturing
15:563:40948:16:12:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:in final expenditure and the relative price of non-manufacturing output have been rising over time.  This
15:564:41053:12:12:71:539:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:observation motivates low elasticities in the structural change literature [Ngai and Pissarides (2007), Herren-

15:566:41274:12:0:71:288:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:by Atalay (2015) and Oberfield and Raval (2015).
16:567:41324:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Trade Frictions and Expenditure WeightsWe introduce the following notation and
16:568:41402:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nomenclature to clarify what aspects of trade frictions and preference/technology parame-
16:569:41491:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ters we are able to back out of the data.25First, we normalize international iceberg frictions
16:570:41585:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative  to  domestic  frictions:ωXjit(s′,s)≡τXjit(s′,s)/τXiit(s′,s)  andωFjit(s)≡τFjit(s)/τFiit(s).
16:571:41686:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Henceforth,  we  refer  toωXjit(s′,s)  andωFjit(s)  as  “trade  frictions,”  since  they  govern  sub-
16:572:41788:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stitution  across  country  sources.   Given  this  normalization  of  the  international  frictions,
16:573:41889:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we define a second set of “expenditure weights” that combine CES weight parameters and
16:574:41975:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestic frictions:ωXit(s′,s)≡λXit(s′,s)(σ−1)/στXiit(s′,s),ωFit(s)≡λFit(s)(ρ−1)/ρτFiit(s).  These
16:575:42072:18:18:72:531:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure weights govern substitution across sectors in sourcing inputs and final goods.
16:576:42162:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To compute changes in trade frictions and expenditure weights, we need additional price
16:577:42249:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data, not already included in our global input-output data.  We need changes in the price
16:578:42338:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of real value added in each sector  ˆpVi(s), and changes in the price of final expenditure  ˆpFi.
16:579:42435:18:18:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Drawing on national accounts sources, we set  ˆpVi(s) equal to changes in GDP deflators in
16:580:42525:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors,  and we set  ˆpFiequal to changes in the
16:581:42614:17:18:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio of nominal to real final expenditure.26We use this price data, along with first order
16:582:42705:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conditions and price indexes from the model, to solve for changes in the trade frictions and
16:583:42797:18:18:72:444:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure weights implied by changes in expenditure shares over time.
16:584:42868:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  estimates  we  recover  via  this  procedure  are  sensible  and  consistent  with  related
16:585:42964:18:18:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work.27Globally, iceberg trade frictions decline by 35% from 1970-2009.  There is significant
16:586:43057:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion in the magnitude of the declines across countries, and declines are strongly corre-
16:587:43151:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lated with changes in openness (as expected).  Trade frictions decline both in manufacturing
16:588:43243:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and non-manufacturing sectors, though declines are somewhat larger for manufactures.  As
16:589:43331:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss further in Section 4.2, RTA adoption predicts declines in trade frictions at the
16:590:43422:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bilateral level.  As for the expenditure weights, changes in final goods expenditure weights
16:591:43514:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are  similar  across  manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  sectors,  while  input  expenditure
16:592:43610:18:39:72:452:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weights have tended to pull input expenditure toward non-manufacturing.

16:594:43703:25:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  now  conduct  counterfactuals  in  the  model  to  assess  the  role  of  trade  frictions  in  ex-
16:595:43806:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:plaining changes in value-added to export ratios.  The first counterfactual holds both trade
16:596:43898:18:16:81:539:159:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:25If domestic trade frictions are constant, then we could identify changes in the level of international trade
16:597:44008:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:frictions and changes in the CES expenditure weights in preferences and technologies.  We do not assume
16:598:44111:12:8:72:395:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:that domestic frictions are constant, so we must redefine parameters here.
16:599:44185:8:15:81:539:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:26We take price changes and exchange rates (to convert GDP and final expenditure deflators to a common
16:600:44287:15:12:72:539:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:currency) from the UN National Accounts Database, with one exception.  For China, we take  ˆpVi(s) from
16:601:44390:12:9:72:467:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the World Development Indicators, since it is missing for many years in the UN Database.
16:602:44478:9:15:81:539:87:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:27For example, our estimated changes in trade frictions are comparable to estimates by Jacks, Meissner
16:603:44580:15:0:72:332:72:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and Novy (2011).  See the Appendix for detailed discussion.
17:604:44641:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions and expenditure weights constant at their 1970 levels. Following our notation above,
17:605:44735:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f14:B:ˆωXit(s′,s) = ˆωFit(s) = ˆωXjit(s′,s) = ˆωFjit(s) = 1, and the exogenous variables{ˆsit,ˆTit,ˆZit(s),ˆLit}
17:606:44841:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evolve as in the data.  We treat this simulation as the baseline against which we assess the
17:607:44933:18:18:72:360:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative importance of trade versus expenditure weights.
17:608:44989:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The second and third counterfactuals decompose the gap between this baseline and the
17:609:45073:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data into components due to trade frictions versus expenditure weights.  The second coun-
17:610:45162:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:terfactual holds expenditure weights constant at their 1970 levels (ˆωXit(s′,s) =  ˆωFit(s) = 1)
17:611:45258:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and allows trade frictions to evolve as implied by the data.  The third counterfactual holds
17:612:45350:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade frictions constant at their 1970 levels (ˆωXjit(s′,s) = ˆωFjit(s) = 1) and allows expenditure
17:613:45449:18:18:72:282:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weights to evolve as implied by the data.
17:614:45490:18:18:89:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  6  plots  changes  in  value-added  to  export  ratios  for  the  world  as  a  whole.28In
17:615:45588:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the baseline simulation of the model,  there is virtually no long run change in the ratio of
17:616:45680:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added to gross exports.  This means that changes in country size and sectoral output
17:617:45770:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:composition, driven by both productivity and factor endowments in the baseline simulation,
17:618:45860:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:do not explain the decline in the ratio of value-added to gross exports.  Interestingly, these
17:619:45954:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results obtain even though world trade does rise substantially in this counterfactual simu-
17:620:46045:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lation:  the baseline model alone accounts for about 40% of the growth of trade since 1970.
17:621:46136:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The stability of the value-added to export ratio simply means that this gross trade growth
17:622:46226:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is matched by increases in value-added exports.  Adding expenditure weights to the model
17:623:46314:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:does little to change this result.  In contrast, allowing trade frictions to change generates a
17:624:46409:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulated series that captures the evolution of the ratio of value-added to gross exports well.
17:625:46504:18:18:89:539:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 7 plots changes in value-added to export ratios at the sector level.  Here again,
17:626:46592:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the baseline simulation performs poorly.  It accounts for only a small part of the declining
17:627:46684:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added  to  export  ratio  in  manufacturing,  and  the  ratio  in  non-manufacturing  moves
17:628:46781:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the wrong direction entirely.  Expenditure weights close the gap between simulation and
17:629:46871:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data,  but their explanatory power is limited.  Where they play a role is in explaining the
17:630:46962:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:medium-term dynamics of the manufacturing VAX ratio, capturing the pre-1990 slowdown
17:631:47046:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and post-1990 acceleration in the rate of decline.  Trade frictions are important in explaining
17:632:47141:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in the VAX ratio for both sectors.  They explain changes in the non-manufacturing
17:633:47230:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sector almost completely, and explain more than half of the steady decline in manufacturing.
17:634:47322:18:18:89:539:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  8  plots  changes  in  value-added  to  export  ratios  from  1975-2005  at  the  country
17:635:47419:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level.  As in previous figures, both the baseline simulation and the simulation with changes
17:636:47511:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in expenditure weights struggle to match the data.  The baseline simulation under-predicts
17:637:47601:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the magnitude of the declines,  particularly for countries with large declines.  Expenditure
17:638:47693:18:15:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:28To match the simulation, the ‘true’ value-added to export ratios in these figures are computed using a
17:639:47797:15:0:72:317:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:thirty-seven country, two-sector aggregation of the data.
18:640:47856:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weights generate additional dispersion, but do little to improve the overall fit. Again, changes
18:641:47952:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in trade frictions bring the simulated data in line with actual changes for most countries.
18:642:48043:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The visual impression conferred by the figures is confirmed by more systematic measures of
18:643:48133:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the goodness of fit.  The correlations between simulations and data are 0.39 in panels (a)
18:644:48223:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and (b), and 0.69 in panel (c).  Mean errors are 0.11, 0.08, and 0.03 for the three simulations
18:645:48318:18:18:72:125:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(in order).
18:646:48329:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Turning to bilateral flows, we estimate the same regressions used to describe the stylized
18:647:48419:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:facts in Section 2 using simulated data.  The left panel of Table 2 includes long difference
18:648:48511:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regressions that focus on the role distance, while the right panel examines the role of RTAs.
18:649:48604:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consistent with the discussion above, the baseline simulation fails badly at explaining the
18:650:48695:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance or RTA results.  Input-output and final goods expenditure weights do a little better
18:651:48788:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the distance effects.  However, it looks initially like they help explain declines in the value-
18:652:48888:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added to export ratio surrounding RTAs.  This apparent good performance is misleading.
18:653:48974:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Looking at Panels B and C, changes in input-output and final goods expenditure weights
18:654:49060:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lower the simulated bilateral VAX ratio because they lead bilateral value-added exports to
18:655:49150:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fall post-RTA adoption, while gross exports are unchanged – both these results are grossly
18:656:49240:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inconsistent with the data.  Changes in trade frictions, instead, do well in matching both the
18:657:49334:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance and RTA evidence.  They predict both the decline in the VAX ratio and the rise in
18:658:49424:18:18:72:332:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added and gross exports post-RTA adoption.
18:659:49472:18:18:89:539:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To sum up, we set out to evaluate the role of trade frictions in explaining the data.  The
18:660:49562:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:counterfactuals point to changes in trade frictions as the most important force underlying all
18:661:49656:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:five stylized facts.  We therefore shift our attention to examining the role of trade frictions
18:662:49751:18:45:72:157:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in greater detail.

18:664:49814:30:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To  interpret  the  role  of  trade  frictions  in  explaining  the  five  facts,  we  unpack  the  fric-
18:665:49919:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions  themselves.   First,  we  distinguish  trade  frictions  by  sector  (manufacturing  vs.  non-
18:666:50020:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing)  and  end  use  (final  vs.  intermediate  goods).   We  simulate  the  model  with
18:667:50118:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each set of frictions independently, and we use these simulations together with accounting
18:668:50208:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relationships  to  examine  the  mechanics  underlying  changes  in  multilateral  value-added  to
18:669:50306:17:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:export ratios.  Second, we hone in on bilateral frictions to examine the role of policy changes
18:670:50401:18:0:72:488:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:– specifically, RTA adoption – in driving changes in value-added to export ratios.

19:672:50517:26:18:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  run  four  new  counterfactual  simulations  with  changes  in  (1)  final  non-manufacturing
19:673:50614:18:18:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade frictions, holding other trade frictions fixed (ˆωFjit(m) = ˆωXjit(s′,s) = 1), (2) input non-
19:674:50713:18:18:72:540:646:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing trade frictions (with  ˆωFjit(s) = ˆωXjit(m,s) = 1), (3) final manufacturing trade
19:675:50809:18:18:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions (with  ˆωFjit(n) =  ˆωXjit(s′,s) = 1), and (4) input manufacturing trade frictions (with
19:676:50907:18:18:72:539:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ˆωFjit(s)  =  ˆωXjit(n,s)  =  1).   In  all  these  simulations,  expenditure  weights  are  held  constant
19:677:51014:18:18:72:539:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at 1970 levels (ˆωXit(s′,s) =  ˆωFit(s)).  These four simulations decompose the Trade Frictions
19:678:51109:18:34:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulation presented previously, so we compare them that simulation in the analysis below.

19:680:51215:26:18:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Along  all  three  dimensions  of  the  multilateral  data  –  for  the  world,  countries,  and  sec-
19:681:51317:18:18:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tors  –  trade  frictions  for  manufactures  are  more  important  than  trade  frictions  for  non-
19:682:51418:18:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing  output.   Further,  among  manufacturing  trade  frictions,  frictions  for  inputs
19:683:51516:18:18:72:325:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are more important than frictions for final goods.
19:684:51566:18:18:89:539:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Figure 9, we plot the four simulations for the world.  As is evident, changes in trade
19:685:51655:18:18:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions for manufacturing goods used as inputs generate a large decline in the simulated
19:686:51745:18:17:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added to export ratio.  While changes in the remaining frictions are less important,
19:687:51835:17:18:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the ratio also declines due to changes in frictions for final manufacturing goods (particularly
19:688:51930:18:18:72:129:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:post-1990).
19:689:51941:18:18:89:539:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Turning to sectors, we plot value-added to export ratios in the four simulations in Figure
19:690:52031:18:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:10.  Here again, manufacturing trade frictions do the bulk of the work.  Frictions on manu-
19:691:52122:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factured inputs are most important in accounting for the decline in the manufacturing ratio,
19:692:52214:18:18:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though frictions on final manufactures matter as well.  For the non-manufacturing sector,
19:693:52303:18:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:final  manufacturing  frictions  are  most  important,  with  input-manufacturing  frictions  also
19:694:52401:18:18:72:481:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:playing a role in explaining the rising value-added to export ratio in this sector.
19:695:52484:18:18:89:539:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:At the country level, all four simulations generate data that is positively correlated with
19:696:52575:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the composite Trade Frictions simulation, and roughly equally so (the correlations are all near
19:697:52670:18:18:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.5).  However, simulations with changes in non-manufacturing frictions alone underpredict
19:698:52760:18:18:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the size of the declines in value-added to export ratios:  the mean error is 0.10 in simulation
19:699:52855:18:18:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1)  and  0.08  in  simulation  (2).   In  contrast,  simulations  with  changes  in  manufacturing
19:700:52954:18:17:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions generate significant declines in value-added to export ratios, with a mean error of
19:701:53047:17:18:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:0.04 in simulation (3) and -0.006 in simulation (4).  From this, we conclude that frictions for
19:702:53142:18:0:72:495:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufactured inputs are most important in explaining country-level ratios as well.

20:740:54103:18:18:89:539:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We report this decomposition in actual and simulated data in Table 3.  In the data, both
20:741:54191:18:17:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the between and within terms are negative, and the within term is larger than the between
20:742:54280:17:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:term. The within term is obviously driven by the decline in the manufacturing value-added to
20:743:54372:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:export ratio, which dominates the rise in the non-manufacturing ratio because manufactures
20:744:54462:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account  for  60-70%  of  world  trade.   The  between  term  is  negative  because  the  share  of
20:745:54561:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing rises over the period, and the level of the value-added to export ratio is lower
20:746:54655:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  manufacturing  than  non-manufacturing.   The  between  term  is  modest  in  size  because
20:747:54750:18:18:72:378:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:changes in trade shares are small (a few percentage points).

20:752:55191:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that point in the wrong direction for explaining the data, in one way or another.29Falling

20:755:55473:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:effects.  The between effects arise because declines in non-manufacturing trade frictions raise the share of non-
20:756:55586:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:manufacturing in trade, and non-manufacturing has a higher value-added to export ratio than manufacturing.
20:757:55692:12:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Declining trade frictions for final manufactures generate strong negative between effects, but positive within
20:758:55802:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:effects.  The negative between effect here arises because declines in manufacturing frictions raise the share
20:759:55911:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of  manufactures  in  trade.   The  positive  within  effect  is  a  product  of  the  strong  rise  in  VAX  ratios  for
20:760:56032:12:0:72:405:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:non-manufacturing in response to falling final manufacturing trade frictions.
21:761:56111:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:turing (as in Figure 10), and this drives the within effect.  They also increase the share of
21:762:56204:18:35:72:433:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufactures in trade, which accounts for the negative between effect.
21:763:56274:35:18:72:539:655:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Sector  TrendsWe  now  turn  our  attention  to  explaining  the  sector  trends  themselves.
21:764:56367:18:18:71:539:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To  do  this,  it  is  helpful  to  appeal  to  the  tight  (empirical  and  conceptual)  link  between
21:765:56470:18:18:71:539:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added  to  export  ratios  and  the  domestic  content  of  exports.   Domestic  content  is
21:766:56568:18:18:71:539:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  value  of  exports  less  the  import  content  of  exports,  and  it  measures  the  amount  of
21:767:56669:18:18:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestic  value  added  needed  to  produce  exports  [Hummels,  Ishii  and  Yi  (2001)].   As  an
21:768:56767:18:18:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:empirical matter, sector-level domestic content is approximately equal to sector-level value-
21:769:56860:18:18:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added  exports  [Johnson  and  Noguera  (2012a)].   We  therefore  use  domestic  content  as  a
21:770:56956:18:17:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proxy for value-added exports in interpreting sector trends, because domestic content is a
21:771:57046:17:18:72:294:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mathematically simpler object to interpret.
21:772:57089:18:18:89:539:494:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f10:A:Formally,  domestic  content  can  be  written  asDCit=Rit(I−ADit)−1Xit,  whereRit
21:773:57171:18:18:72:539:476:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f10:B:is  a  matrix  with  sector-level  value-added  to  output  ratiosrit(s)  along  the  diagonal,ADit
21:774:57270:18:18:72:539:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  the  domestic  input-output  matrix,  andXitis  the  export  vector  of  countryi.30The
21:775:57361:18:18:72:539:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestic content to gross export ratio at the sector level is then:DCit(s)/Xit(s) =wit(s,s)+
21:776:57453:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f2:B:wit(s,s′)(Xit(s′)/Xit(s)), where the weightswit(s,s′) are the elements ofRit(I−ADit)−1and
21:777:57542:18:18:72:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicate how much domestic content from sectorsis needed to produce exports from sector
21:778:57629:18:18:72:539:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sectors′.   These  weights  depend  both  on  cross-sector  input  linkages  –  how  much  output
21:779:57726:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from sectorsis used in producing exports in sectors′(via (I−ADit)−1) and the imported-
21:780:57812:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:input  intensity  of  production  in  sectors(viaRit).   Finally,  note  that  this  ratio  depends
21:781:57911:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:directly  on  export  composition,  because  domestic  content  is  both  exported  directly  via  a
21:782:58011:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sector’s own exports and indirectly via exports of other sectors.  As indirect exports rise,
21:783:58103:18:18:72:221:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thenDCit(s)/Xit(s) will rise.
21:784:58132:18:17:89:539:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Putting  these  observations  to  work,  falling  frictions  on  manufactured  inputs  increase
21:785:58227:17:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:foreign  sourcing  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  hence  drive  downDCit(m)/Xit(m)  in
21:786:58320:18:18:72:539:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing.  They also simultaneously drive upDCit(n)/Xit(n), because they raise the
21:787:58407:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:share  of  manufactures  in  trade,  which  in  turn  raises  the  level  of  indirect  exports  by  the
21:788:58511:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:non-manufacturing  sector.   Falling  frictions  on  final  manufactures  have  similar  composi-
21:789:58608:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tional  effects,  which  explains  why  they  too  raise  the  value-added  to  export  ratio  in  non-
21:790:58711:18:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing.  These compositional effects also contribute to the decline in the value-added
21:791:58804:18:18:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to export ratio in manufacturing, since they lower indirect exports of manufacturing value
21:792:58894:18:18:72:539:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added, by reducing (Xit(n)/Xit(m)).  Together these mechanisms explain the dominant role
21:793:58982:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of manufacturing trade frictions in explaining the trends in sector-level VAX ratios, depicted
21:794:59076:18:15:81:540:99:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:30To interpret this, (I−ADit)−1Xitis the amount of domestic gross output needed to produce exports,
21:795:59175:15:0:72:502:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:so multiplying by the value-added to output ratio yields a measure of domestic content in exports.

22:797:59287:35:18:72:539:673:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Country-Level ChangesLooking at cross-country changes in value-added to export ra-
22:798:59369:18:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tios,  the same basic within and between forces come into play as in the aggregate.  As at
22:799:59459:18:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the world level,  the value-added to export ratio in manufacturing declines in virtually all
22:800:59551:18:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries.  The large majority of countries also see increases in value-added to export ratios
22:801:59645:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in non-manufacturing.  Further, the level of the non-manufacturing ratio is higher than the
22:802:59736:18:18:72:295:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing VAX essentially everywhere.
22:803:59777:18:18:89:539:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The main difference is that between effects are more important in explaining country-
22:804:59862:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level changes than they are at the world level.  The reason is that changes in trade shares
22:805:59953:18:17:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are substantially larger at the country-level than in the aggregate, so they play a larger role
22:806:60048:17:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the between-within decomposition.  Countries with the largest declines in value-added to
22:807:60139:18:18:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:export ratios tend to have very large, negative between effects (i.e., tend to see large increases
22:808:60237:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the share of manufacturing exports).  Because declines in manufacturing trade frictions
22:809:60327:18:18:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increase manufacturing exports, they are important in explaining cross-country variation as
22:810:60418:18:39:72:95:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:well.
22:811:60423:39:26:72:394:401:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:C:4.2    The Role of Regional Trade Agreements
22:812:60467:26:18:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  now  turn  to  assessing  the  role  of  regional  trade  agreements  in  our  results.   Our  first
22:813:60571:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goal is to confirm that Fact 5 – that RTAs lower bilateral value-added to export ratios –
22:814:60660:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is  explained  entirely  by  changes  in  bilateral  trade  costs  surrounding  RTA  adoption.   Our
22:815:60760:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:second goal is to quantify how much of the decline in the world value-added to export ratio
22:816:60851:18:17:72:306:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is explained by the spread of RTAs over time.
22:817:60896:17:18:89:539:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  approach  we  take  is  to  simulate  a  counterfactual  world  in  which  no  new  regional
22:818:60993:18:18:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade agreements were adopted between 1970 and 2009, and then we compare this to data.
22:819:61079:18:18:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To do this, we need to construct counterfactual trade frictions that capture how trade fric-
22:820:61171:18:18:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tions would have evolved in the absence of post-1970 RTAs.  We proceed in two steps (see
22:821:61259:18:18:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the Appendix for details).  In the first step, we model trade frictions as a function of RTAs
22:822:61352:18:18:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other unobserved time-varying importer,  exporter,  and pair-specific factors.  We then
22:823:61443:18:18:72:540:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate the impact of RTA adoption by regressing changes in measured frictions (for each
22:824:61532:18:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:input sector-pair or final goods sector separately) on fixed effects and trade agreement in-
22:825:61624:18:18:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dicators.  In the second step, we use the estimated RTA coefficients to adjust the measured
22:826:61715:18:18:72:454:124:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:trade frictions, removing changes in trade frictions due to RTA adoption.31
22:827:61790:18:15:81:539:106:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:31For pairs that form a new RTA after 1970, trade frictions equal measured values prior to RTA adoption
22:828:61893:15:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:and then are adjusted upward post-RTA as if the RTA were never signed.  For all pairs that either never
22:829:61996:12:0:72:468:79:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:form an RTA or already had an RTA in force in 1970, trade frictions evolve as in the data.
23:830:62088:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:As expected,  our estimates indicate that RTA adoption lowers bilateral trade frictions
23:831:62175:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among adopting countries.32To summarize the magnitudes, trade frictions fall by roughly
23:832:62262:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:7-8% after RTA adoption when we measure RTA adoption using a simple binary indicator.
23:833:62347:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:When we allow for dynamic phase-in effects, RTAs lower trade frictions by 16-20% in the
23:834:62434:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:long run.  We view these estimates as lower and upper bounds on plausible RTA-impacts.
23:835:62520:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:When we separate agreements, we find an ordering of changes in trade frictions consistent
23:836:62609:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with our previous gravity results:  deep trade agreements are associated with larger declines
23:837:62702:18:18:72:300:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in trade frictions than shallower agreements.
23:838:62747:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Using these results, we simulate the model with counterfactual trade frictions, removing
23:839:62835:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:post-1970  RTAs  and  allowing  all  other  driving  forces  (including  changes  in  expenditure
23:840:62932:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weights) to evolve as implied by data.  This means that deviations between simulated and
23:841:63020:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:true  data  in  this  set  of  results  reflect  only  the  removal  of  RTAs.   To  frame  the  analysis,
23:842:63126:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recall that we showed (in Table 2) that changes in trade frictions can account for declines in
23:843:63220:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value-added relative to gross exports following adoption of regional trade agreements (Fact
23:844:63311:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:5).  We now demonstrate that changes in bilateral frictions attributable to RTA adoption
23:845:63399:18:18:72:156:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:drive this result.
23:846:63417:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Using  the  simulated  data,  we  re-estimate  the  baseline  regressions  specifications  used
23:847:63512:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:previously to document RTA effects.  Because we have removed changes in trade frictions
23:848:63599:18:18:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:attributable to RTAs, we expect RTAs to haveno effecton bilateral value-added to export
23:849:63686:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratios in these regressions.  In fact, that is exactly what we find.  In Panel A of Table 4, the
23:850:63782:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:RTA-coefficient is numerically close to, and statistically indistinguishable from, zero.  This
23:851:63876:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:holds regardless of the technique we use to remove RTAs.  Further, this result reflects zero
23:852:63968:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:impact  of  regional  agreements  on  both  value-added  exports  (Panel  B)  and  gross  exports
23:853:64065:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Panel  C)  when  RTAs  are  removed.   These  results  imply  that  RTA-induced  changes  in
23:854:64158:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bilateral trade frictions alone drive the differential response of bilateral value-added versus
23:855:64253:18:18:72:378:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gross trade that we observe in the data post-RTA adoption.
23:856:64311:18:17:89:539:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:An important remaining question is: does the spread of RTAs also help explain the global
23:857:64399:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:decline in the ratio of value-added to gross exports?  The answer is that post-1970 RTAs can
23:858:64491:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explain  roughly  6-15%  of  the  overall  decline.   With  RTA  effects  estimated  using  a  binary
23:859:64592:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:RTA indicator, the ratio of value-added to gross exports for the world as a whole falls by
23:860:64682:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:about 6% less in the counterfactual than in the data.  When we split agreements by type,

24:867:65291:18:46:72:424:690:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in driving the global decline in value-added relative to gross exports.
24:868:65362:46:29:72:194:644:17:g_d0_f8:17:g_d0_f8:C:5    Conclusion
24:869:65377:29:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:With the rise of cross-border supply chains, conventional (gross) trade data is an increasingly
24:870:65472:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:misleading  guide  to  how  value  added  is  traded  in  the  global  economy.   In  this  paper,  we
24:871:65574:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:characterized  changes  in  gross  versus  value-added  trade  over  four  decades.   Value-added
24:872:65671:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exports are falling relative to gross exports, implying double counting in gross trade data is
24:873:65765:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more pervasive today than in the past.  Importantly,  gaps between gross and value-added
24:874:65853:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exports are unevenly distributed across time, sectors, countries, and bilateral partners. These
24:875:65948:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:differences imply that shifting from a gross to value-added view of trade changes the relative
24:876:66042:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:openness of sectors or countries, and the relative importance of bilateral trade partners for
24:877:66135:18:18:72:154:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a given country.
24:878:66151:18:18:89:539:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Using a structural gravity model, we found that changes in trade frictions play a first-
24:879:66239:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:order role in explaining not only global trends, but also differences across countries, sectors,
24:880:66335:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and bilateral partners. We emphasize in particular that regional trade agreements have led to
24:881:66428:17:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declines in value-added relative to gross trade among adopting partners, such that the spread
24:882:66521:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of RTAs over time can account for 15% of the decline in the world value-added to export
24:883:66608:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio  over  time.   In  contrast,  other  major  structural  changes  in  the  global  economy  (e.g.,
24:884:66711:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the increasing weight of emerging markets in global GDP) play a minimal role.  Changes in
24:885:66800:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sector-level patterns of input use and demand are also relatively unimportant, as compared
24:886:66890:18:18:72:218:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to the role of trade frictions.
24:887:66921:18:18:89:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our  results  have  a  number  of  implications  for  future  research.   First,  the  value-added
24:888:67019:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data  we  provide  are  immediately  useful  for  parameterizing  quantitative  models.   Because
24:889:67116:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the value-added content is falling over time, shifting from gross to value-added export data
24:890:67208:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in empirical applications is more important now than ever.  Second, the large role of trade
24:891:67299:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:frictions in explaining changes in gross versus value-added trade calls for re-visiting classic
24:892:67394:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:questions about the burden of trade frictions.  For example, how do gross trade frictions map
24:893:67487:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:into reduced form frictions for trading value added, or how do RTAs induce trade creation
24:894:67576:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:vs. diversion in value-added exports?  Third, if one knows the factor/task contents employed
24:895:67668:17:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in producing value added, one can immediately convert value-added exports into bilateral
24:896:67756:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measures of factor/task trade.  Therefore, the type of value-added data we provide should
24:897:67845:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be useful in analyzing models of factor/task trade, including the role of factor/task trade in
24:898:67939:18:0:72:322:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explaining changes in the distribution of income.

36:1278:82460:27:14:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This appendix describes the data sources and procedures that we use to construct the input-

36:1281:82657:22:14:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To measure macroeconomic aggregates and sector-level production over time, we primarily
36:1282:82744:14:15:72:539:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f33:B:rely on the United Nations National Accounts Main Aggregates Database [http://unstats.

36:1284:82917:14:15:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expenditure side breakdown of GDP (consumption, investment, government spending, ex-
36:1285:83001:15:14:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ports, and imports) from the UN data.  We use data from the World Development Indicators
36:1286:83089:14:15:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:[http://databank.worldbank.org] for China.33We also take sector-level GDP data from
36:1287:83172:15:14:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these sources for the four composite sectors, and include the sector definitions in Table A2.
36:1288:83265:14:15:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, we extract goods and services trade shares in total exports and total imports from
36:1289:83356:15:14:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the IMF Balance of Payments Statistics (BPM5) [http://elibrary-data.imf.org/], and
36:1290:83438:14:14:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we use these shares to split exports and imports from the expenditure-side GDP data into
36:1291:83526:14:35:72:170:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:goods and services.

36:1293:83562:22:15:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We combine bilateral commodity trade statistics with multilateral totals from the national
36:1294:83652:15:14:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:accounts  to  generate  a  bilateral  trade  database  that  is  consistent  in  level  terms  with  the
36:1295:83756:14:15:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:national accounts.  First, we discuss bilateral commodity trade data sources, classification of
36:1296:83851:15:14:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade according to final and intermediate use, and correspondences to industry data.  Second,
36:1297:83944:14:15:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss how we harmonize the commodity trade data with national accounts data.  Third,
36:1298:84033:15:14:72:409:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we discuss how we deal with missing bilateral services trade data.
36:1299:84099:14:14:89:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f33:A:For  bilateral  goods  trade,  we  draw  on  the  NBER-UN  Database  [http://cid.econ.
36:1300:84185:14:15:71:540:308:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f2:B:ucdavis.edu]  for  1970-2000  and  the  CEPII  BACI  Database  [http://www.cepii.fr]  for
36:1301:84274:15:14:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1995-2009.   This  data  is  reported  on  a  commodity-basis.   We  assign  commodities  to  end
36:1302:84371:14:15:71:540:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f33:B:uses  and  industries  using  existing  correspondences  from  the  World  Bank  [http://wits.
36:1303:84465:15:14:71:539:264:12:g_d0_f33:12:g_d0_f2:B:worldbank.org].  To assign commodities to end uses, we use correspondences between SITC
36:1304:84552:14:15:71:539:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Revision 2) 4-digit or HS (1996 Revision) 6-digit commodities and the BEC end use clas-
36:1305:84640:15:14:71:539:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sifications.  To assign commodities to industries, we use correspondences between SITC and
36:1306:84730:14:15:71:539:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:HS categories and ISIC (Revision 2) industries.34We then map ISIC sectors into our four
36:1307:84817:15:14:71:164:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:composite sectors.
36:1308:84835:14:14:89:539:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  general,  these  correspondences  provide  a  clean  mapping  from  the  trade  to  end  use
36:1309:84931:14:15:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or industry classifications.  We are able to match upwards of 95% of trade to industries in
36:1310:85022:15:14:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:most country years, and the match quality for the post-1995 BACI data is nearly perfect.
36:1311:85110:14:18:71:369:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, there are a few complications that we note here.
36:1312:85167:18:16:81:539:131:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:33Comparing the WDI to the UN data, values for most countries are nearly identical. China is an exception.
36:1313:85273:16:8:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:Upon examination of other sources (e.g., Chinese national accounts), the WDI data appears more accurate.
36:1314:85377:8:16:81:539:107:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:34For  a  few  unassigned  commodities,  we  use  a  supplemental  correspondence  between  SITC  and  ISIC
36:1315:85484:16:0:72:524:91:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:classifications developed by Marc Muendler [http://econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/html/resource.html].
37:1316:85580:0:15:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:First,  though  most  commodities  map  into  unique  end  use  classifications,  some  do  not
37:1317:85675:15:14:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., “motor spirits” in the BEC classification is a mixed use commodity).  For these mixed
37:1318:85767:14:15:72:497:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:use commodities, we assign half the value to final use and half to intermediate use.
37:1319:85851:15:14:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, some trade cannot be assigned using the correspondences.  This problem occurs
37:1320:85936:14:15:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:primarily in the NBER-UN data, where there are aggregate categories ending in ’X’ (e.g.,
37:1321:86024:15:14:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:04XX)  for  some  countries  and  years  that  include  trade  that  could  not  be  disaggregated.
37:1322:86123:14:15:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Where possible, we map directly from higher levels of aggregation (e.g., SITC 2 digit codes)
37:1323:86215:15:14:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to sectors/uses.  Where necessary,  we split unallocated SITC 1-digit residual trade across
37:1324:86306:14:14:72:437:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sectors/uses using the world-level allocation shares for these categories.
37:1325:86380:14:15:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Having formed a complete bilateral goods trade dataset, we need to harmonize the levels
37:1326:86467:15:14:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of bilateral trade with aggregate exports and imports in the national accounts. The procedure
37:1327:86560:14:15:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we  use  is  as  follows.   First,  we  harmonize  levels  for  aggregate  bilateral  goods  trade  with
37:1328:86664:15:14:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:national accounts totals.35Second, we use the share of each sector and end use in bilateral
37:1329:86755:14:15:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade from the commodity trade data to allocate the harmonized bilateral goods trade to
37:1330:86842:15:14:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sectors and end uses.  This yields a sector-level bilateral final and intermediate goods trade
37:1331:86936:14:15:72:358:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dataset that aggregates to match the national accounts.
37:1332:86991:15:14:89:539:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Next, we turn to bilateral services trade.  Unfortunately, bilateral services trade data has
37:1333:87083:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:not  been  collected  with  the  same  scope  and  rigor  as  goods  trade  data;  Data  on  bilateral
37:1334:87185:14:15:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:services trade is incomplete today, and virtually nonexistent going back in time.  Therefore
37:1335:87277:15:14:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we impute these flows using multilateral data on services trade along with bilateral trade
37:1336:87367:14:15:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shares  for  goods.   This  procedure  is  sensible,  given  the  strong  correlation  between  goods
37:1337:87468:15:14:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and services trade shares in modern data.  We run a constrained least squares program that
37:1338:87558:14:15:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:finds the bilateral services flows that minimize deviations between imputed services trade
37:1339:87648:15:14:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shares and target shares (based on goods trade), subject to the constraint that the sum of
37:1340:87738:14:35:72:493:361:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:the bilateral flows be equal to multilateral exports and imports for each country.36
37:1341:87822:35:22:72:259:326:14:g_d0_f8:14:g_d0_f8:C:A.3    Input-Output Tables
37:1342:87848:22:14:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  obtain  input-output  tables  from  the  OECD  Input-Output  Database  (1995  and  2011
37:1343:87939:14:15:72:539:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:editions)  [http://www.oecd.org/sti/inputoutput/]  and  the  IDE-JETRO  Asian  Input-
37:1344:88024:15:14:72:539:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Output Tables [http://www.ide.go.jp/].  Benchmark tables are available for countries and
37:1345:88112:14:18:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:years listed in Table A1.  The mapping between sectors in the input-output data and our
37:1346:88199:18:16:81:539:243:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:35In this step, we take bilateral trade shares from the commodity trade data and multiply them with the
37:1347:88302:16:12:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:level of goods exports and imports reported in the national accounts.  This procedure yields two conflicting
37:1348:88410:12:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:estimates for each bilateral trade flow, one ‘exporter report’ from multiplying the trade share times reported
37:1349:88520:12:12:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:multilateral exports in a given source country and a corresponding ‘importer report’ from multiplying the
37:1350:88625:12:12:72:540:191:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:trade share times reported multilateral imports in a given destination.  To reconcile the flows, we average the
37:1351:88736:12:12:72:540:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:flows to form a single bilateral flow and then add or subtract the residual (e.g., the exporter report minus
37:1352:88844:12:11:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:the reconciled trade flow) from trade flows with the rest of the world.  This procedure occasionally results
37:1353:88952:11:12:72:540:156:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:in negative values for trade with the rest of the world, concentrated in particular countries and years where
37:1354:89061:12:12:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:either trade or national accounts data are suspect (e.g., for Argentina in the early 1970’s).  We adjust the
37:1355:89169:12:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:data to eliminate these zeros using a constrained least squares procedure that penalizes changes in trade
37:1356:89274:12:9:72:479:120:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:shares among the 42 countries in our sample.  The necessarily adjustments are trivially small.
37:1357:89368:9:15:81:539:111:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:36The  target  shares  are  constructed  by  multiplying  goods  trade  shares  with  multilateral  services  trade
37:1358:89483:15:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:from the national accounts.  As in the goods data, this yields conflicting exporter and importer reports, and
37:1359:89592:12:0:72:430:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:we set the reconciled flow equal to the average report, as in the previous footnote.
38:1360:89678:0:15:72:327:708:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:four composite sectors are included in Table A2.37
38:1361:89728:15:14:89:539:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In  the  input-output  tables,  there  are  accounting  variables  that  we  did  not  explicitly
38:1362:89825:14:15:71:539:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:define in our framework, such as statistical discrepancies, other adjustments, non-comparable
38:1363:89918:15:14:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports, and net taxes.38In general, these tend to be small or exactly zero (due to how data
38:1364:90010:14:15:71:539:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is reported from national authorities to the OECD). We drop net taxes, and therefore define
38:1365:90101:15:14:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:value  added  as  output  (the  row  sum  of  the  tables)  less  inputs  used  (the  column  sum  of
38:1366:90202:14:15:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the domestic and import input-output tables).39We allocate other adjustments and non-
38:1367:90287:15:14:71:539:606:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comparable exports and imports to the services sector, based on the fact that non-comparable
38:1368:90379:14:14:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:imports in the U.S. input-output accounts are entirely services.  Finally, values in the input-
38:1369:90474:14:15:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:output tables are reported in national currency in the OECD input-output tables. We convert
38:1370:90565:15:14:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these to U.S. dollars using end-of-year exchange rates from the IMF’s International Financial
38:1371:90658:14:15:71:539:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Statistics (AE series) and OECDStat.  Values in the IDE-JETRO tables are reported in U.S.
38:1372:90747:15:14:71:108:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dollars.
38:1373:90755:14:15:89:539:520:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Because the input-output and national accounts data are taken from separate sources,
38:1374:90839:15:14:71:539:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:they are not identical.  On top of this,  input-output tables are available only for selected
38:1375:90932:14:15:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:benchmark years, which differ across countries.  To reconcile data sources and extrapolate
38:1376:91022:15:14:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from benchmark to non-benchmark years,  we adjust the benchmark input-output data to
38:1377:91106:14:14:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:match the time-varying national accounts and trade data using a constrained least squares
38:1378:91195:14:15:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:procedure.  In doing so, we give priority to matching the national accounts and trade data,
38:1379:91286:15:14:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both because they are available in all years and measured consistently through time (likely
38:1380:91377:14:15:71:539:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with less error).  The objective is to minimize the weighted squared distance between the
38:1381:91466:15:14:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adjusted data and input-output data for benchmark years (or interpolations thereof), subject
38:1382:91558:14:15:71:457:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to a set of accounting identities.  We pause here to spell out this procedure.
38:1383:91636:15:14:89:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To define notation, letIDiandIIibe 4×4 matrices of domestic and imported inputs, with
38:1384:91721:14:15:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elementsIDi(s,s′) andIIi(s,s′), letfDiandfIibe 4×1 vectors of domestic and imported
38:1385:91804:15:14:71:539:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:final demand, and letyibe a 4×1 vector of sector-level output.  Further, the 4×1 vector
38:1386:91891:14:14:71:428:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of exports isxi.  Note we suppress year notation here for convenience.
38:1387:91961:14:15:89:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the national accounts and trade data, we observe the following objects, denoted with
38:1388:92048:15:14:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bars to indicate data.  We observe sector-level value added in a 1×4 vector   ̄vaiand (scaler)

38:1390:92237:15:14:71:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:observe  imports  by  sector  and  end  use  for  goods  – ̄fIi(s)  and ̄IIi(s)  fors=  1,2,3  –  and
38:1391:92338:14:15:71:192:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:services imports   ̄mit(4).
38:1392:92365:15:14:89:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Sector-level  input  use  for  domestic  and  imported  intermediates  (IDi,IIi),  sector-level
38:1393:92460:14:15:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestic  and  imported  final  goods  absorption  (fDi,fIi(4)),  and  sector-level  gross  output
38:1394:92558:15:14:71:539:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(yi(s))  are  treated  as  unknowns.   We  observe  ‘target’  values  for  each  of  these  unknowns,
38:1395:92659:14:18:71:539:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:based on the value of these variables in the input-output tables for benchmark years, and
38:1396:92748:18:15:81:539:184:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:37The  original  OECD  data  covers  35  sectors  for  years  before  1990  and  48  sectors  for  years  after  1995,
38:1397:92866:15:12:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:though  not  all  countries  report  data  at  this  level  of  disaggregation.   The  IDE-JETRO  tables  contain  24
38:1398:92983:12:9:72:298:157:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:sectors.  Aggregation enables us to link these tables.
38:1399:93037:9:15:81:539:148:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:38Further,  in  the  pre-1995  data,  a  few  countries  have  negative  entries  in  their  import  tables,  due  to
38:1400:93154:15:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:treatment  of  transport  margins,  recycled  products,  and  measurement  error.   We  eliminate  these  using  a
38:1401:93268:12:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:procedure similar to that which we use to merge the IO tables with the production and trade data below,
38:1402:93371:12:9:72:209:109:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:so omit details here for brevity.
38:1403:93404:9:15:81:539:100:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:39Recall that we adjust this data to match national accounts value added by sector.  The only way value
38:1404:93507:15:12:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:added from the input-output tables is used is to create value-added to output ratios, which are the basis for
38:1405:93616:12:0:72:465:73:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:generating target values for gross output in the harmonization procedure described below.
39:1406:93707:0:15:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:linear  interpolations  between  benchmark  years.40We  construct  target  sector  output  by
39:1407:93800:15:14:71:539:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dividing value added from the national accounts by the value added to output ratio in the
39:1408:93889:14:15:71:539:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:input-output tables.  We also construct target sector final expenditure by multiplying final
39:1409:93981:15:14:71:458:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand in the national accounts by sector shares from input-output tables.
39:1410:94055:14:15:89:539:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In each year, we solve for values for these ‘unknown’ variables that:  (a) minimize differ-
39:1411:94146:15:14:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ences between the adjusted data and raw data observed in benchmark years (or interpolations
39:1412:94237:14:15:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:thereof between benchmark years); and (b) satisfy adding up constraints.  We constrain the
39:1413:94327:15:14:71:539:606:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:solution to match sector-level GDP, exports and imports of final and intermediate goods for
39:1414:94418:14:14:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each of the three goods sectors, exports and imports of services, and aggregate final expen-
39:1415:94510:14:15:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diture.  These constraints provide a lot of discipline in extrapolating the benchmark data.

45:1860:105756:22:14:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In computing trade frictions,  expenditure weights,  and counterfactuals,  we confront a few

45:1863:105927:12:16:81:539:203:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:43Because the Penn World Tables capital stock series is built using an investment-specific deflator, this
45:1864:106032:16:12:72:540:187:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:real investment series allows for investment-specific technical change, which is embedded in ˆsit.  In making

45:1866:106244:12:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of  investment  in  final  expenditure  and  the  rate  of  investment-specific  technical  are  exogenous.   This  is
45:1867:106362:12:12:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:substantively the same as in Levchenko and Zhang (2016).  While Levchenko and Zhang take the (nominal)
45:1868:106464:12:12:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:savings  rate  as  exogenous,  this  is  equivalent  to  taking  the  nominal  investment  share  as  given  since  their
45:1869:106585:12:12:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:baseline  model  has  balanced  trade.   They  also  use  the  Penn  World  Tables  capital  stock  to  compute  real
45:1870:106702:12:0:72:165:115:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:investment, as we do.
46:1871:106725:0:15:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:B:Rest of the WorldAs noted in Section 1.2, we possess input-output data for 42 individual

46:1873:106914:14:15:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model accounting exercise, we focus on the 37 countries that have complete time series data
46:1874:107005:15:14:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 1970-2009, and add the remaining 5 Eastern European countries to the rest-of-the-world
46:1875:107096:14:15:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:composite.  Because we do not have input-output and price data for this rest-of-the-world

46:1877:107239:14:15:89:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:First, we assume that changes in gross exports from each country to the rest of the world

46:1893:107780:15:14:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second,  we  assume  that  gross  output  prices  for  imports  from  the  rest  of  the  world

46:1897:108076:15:14:89:540:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f14:A:In all simulations, we feed realized values for̂EXi,ROW,t(s) and{ˆτXROW,it(s,s′),ˆτFROW,it(s)}

46:1904:108723:15:14:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Alternatively, if a particular value is positive in the initial period and then zero in period

46:1906:108910:14:15:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these occurrences are rare, we deal with them by adopting an approximation.  We take any

46:1909:109190:15:14:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:output) as necessary to satisfy adding up conditions.  This approximation plays no role in

47:1912:109340:27:14:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This appendix documents how trade frictions and expenditure weights change over time.  It
47:1913:109429:14:15:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also describes how we estimate the response of trade frictions to adoption of regional trade

47:1916:109636:22:15:72:540:596:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  our  framework,  changes  in  trade  frictions  vary  across  bilateral  pairs  at  the  sector  (or
47:1917:109740:15:14:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sector-pair) level.  To summarize them, we aggregate the frictions in to composite indexes.
47:1918:109831:14:15:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These indexes can be constructed for any time horizon.  In our analysis below, we focus on
47:1919:109921:15:14:72:539:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:long horizon changes in trade frictions, from 1970 to 2009.44Therefore, the hat-notation in
47:1920:110012:14:15:72:540:538:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this section can be interpreted as denoting the ratio of frictions in 2009 relative to 1970, and

48:2029:111918:14:15:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this translates into a decline in iceberg frictions on the order of 17%.47For comparison, our
48:2030:112011:15:14:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimates imply that iceberg frictions fell by 23% over the 1970-2000 interval, close to the
48:2031:112103:14:15:72:539:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Jacks et al.  estimate.48Comparing this to our estimate over the entire 1970-2008 interval,
48:2032:112194:15:14:72:400:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:iceberg trade costs continued to fall (rapidly) during the 2000’s.

48:2037:112629:15:14:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is that they line up with changes in openness in a sensible way.  To illustrate this, Figure C1

48:2046:113306:15:14:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Three general points are worth making.  First,  the changes in final goods expenditure
48:2047:113392:14:15:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weights  are  broadly  similar  across  sectors.   This  holds  despite  the  fact  that  the  share  of
48:2048:113496:15:14:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:services in final expenditure is rising.  The reason is that this rise in the services share is
48:2049:113591:14:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largely accounted for in the model by the complementarity between manufactures and non-
48:2050:113678:18:16:81:539:343:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:46In the main body of the paper, Jacks et al.  use country-level GDP data to measure production (and
48:2051:113778:16:12:72:540:327:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:hence domestic trade).  In Appendix B of their paper, they use data on gross output for goods producing
48:2052:113881:12:12:72:540:315:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:sectors instead.  Our approach to measuring frictions is closer to this second gross output method, and so
48:2053:113987:12:8:72:194:303:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:we use it as our benchmark.
48:2054:114014:8:11:81:540:295:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:47Letτ= (1 +t) be the iceberg friction and lettis the ad valorem tariff equivalent.  Jacks et al.  report
48:2055:114119:11:8:73:90:284:7:g_d0_f18:5:g_d0_f34:F:t2000
48:2056:114124:8:0:73:503:276:7:g_d0_f18:10:g_d0_f6:F:t1970= 0.74.  To compare this to our figure, we need to convert this into a ratio of iceberg frictions:
48:2057:114227:0:8:508:535:284:7:g_d0_f5:5:g_d0_f34:?:1+t2000
48:2058:114234:8:8:508:540:276:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:1+t1970.
48:2059:114242:8:12:72:540:268:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:This requires taking a stand on the level of trade frictions in 1970.  A reasonable guess is that trade frictions
48:2060:114355:12:12:72:540:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:were 200% in 1970,  since Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) report ad valorem trade costs totaled 170%
48:2061:114455:12:12:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:based on evidence from the 1990’s and early 2000’s.  Given this prior, then the Jacks et al.  tariff equivalent
48:2062:114566:12:9:72:465:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:estimates implies that the ratio of iceberg frictions in 2000 relative to 1970 would be 0.83.
48:2063:114659:9:15:81:539:223:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:48There are many technical reasons why the estimates should not match exactly, and it is not the purpose
48:2064:114763:15:12:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:of this paper to conduct a fine-grained comparison of them.  Nonetheless, it is useful to highlight a few basic
48:2065:114874:12:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:issues.  First, we use a lower trade elasticity than do Jacks et al.  (4 versus 8).  Second, our sample includes
48:2066:114986:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:emerging markets, where declines in frictions have been larger.  Both these tend to raise our estimates relative
48:2067:115098:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:to Jacks et al.  On the other hand, we include services trade, where the Jacks et al.  estimate covers goods
48:2068:115206:12:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:trade only.  This tends to attenuate measured changes in aggregate trade frictions, since frictions in services
48:2069:115317:12:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:have fallen more slowly than in manufactures (see Table C1).  All together, we conclude that our estimates
48:2070:115423:12:8:72:404:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:are in the ballpark of what is currently known about changes in trade costs.
48:2071:115499:8:16:81:539:128:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:F:49Here  we  exclude  data  for  2009,  during  the  Great  Recession  and  Trade  Collapse.   The  reason  is  that
48:2072:115614:16:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:there are sharp changes in demand composition during the recession, which are picked up in the measured
48:2073:115717:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:expenditure weights.  For example, the final expenditure weight on manufacturing is substantially lower in
48:2074:115823:12:12:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:2009,  reflecting the collapse in demand for manufactures (despite minimal price changes) observed in the
48:2075:115928:12:0:72:475:76:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:F:data.  Discarding these recession-induced changes gives us a clearer picture of secular trends.
49:2076:116025:0:15:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufactures  in  preferences.   Second,  on  the  input  side,  increases  in  expenditure  weights
49:2077:116125:15:14:72:540:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for  the  use  of  non-manufactures  as  inputs  have  tended  to  pull  input  expenditure  toward
49:2078:116224:14:15:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:non-manufactures over time.  This reflects structural change in IO tables, not accounted for
49:2079:116316:15:14:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by relative price changes.  In contrast, manufactures have become more intensively used in
49:2080:116406:14:15:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:services (indicated in the 2,1 column) for reasons not accounted for by relative prices.  Third,
49:2081:116502:15:14:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at the individual and country and sector level, there is a good bit of heterogeneity in how
49:2082:116593:14:15:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these expenditure weights evolve.  We implicitly assess whether these structural shifts and
49:2083:116684:15:34:72:303:606:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:heterogeneity matter via the counterfactuals.

49:2107:118169:14:15:89:539:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Following the discussion in Section 2.2, we estimate these regressions using several alter-

49:2110:118382:14:15:89:539:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Using the point estimates on trade agreement indicators from estimating Equation (C6),
49:2111:118468:15:14:72:539:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we adjust measured trade frictions ˆωXijt(s,s′) and ˆωFijt(s) to remove changes due to adoption
49:2112:118563:14:15:72:392:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of trade agreements.  The exact procedure we use is as follows.
49:2113:118626:15:14:89:539:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We first cumulate changes in the trade frictions to define a series that defines changes
49:2114:118714:14:15:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since 1970.  Let ˆυXijt(s,s′)≡ωXijt(s,s′)/ωXij1970(s,s′) and ˆυFijt(s)≡ωFijt(s)/ωFij1970(s) denote the
49:2115:118816:15:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio  of  trade  frictions  in  year  t  relative  to  1970.   Then  we  compute  bilateral  adjustment

55:2331:126559:14:15:89:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Section 4, we mentioned that trade composition plays a large role in explaining differ-

55:2356:127119:17:15:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To reiterate, the between term is driven by changes in trade shares for a given country, while
55:2357:127213:15:14:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the within term is driven by changes in value-added to export ratios within sectors in that
55:2358:127304:14:15:71:112:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country.
55:2359:127312:15:14:89:539:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results for this decomposition are presented in the last two columns of Table D2.  We
55:2360:127397:14:14:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:also  include  data  on  changes  in  the  share  of  manufacturing  of  exports  in  the  table.   The
55:2361:127500:14:15:71:539:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:takeaway is that is that changes in the composition of trade are important determinants of
55:2362:127590:15:14:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:difference in the magnitude of value-added to export ratio changes across countries.  Broadly,
55:2363:127684:14:15:71:539:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the share of manufactures in trade increases in non-commodity exporter emerging markets.
55:2364:127772:15:14:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Since the value-added to export ratio is lower for manufacturing than non-manufacturing,
55:2365:127860:14:15:71:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:an increase in the share of manufacturing in trade mechanically lowers the aggregate VAX
55:2366:127948:15:14:71:539:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ratio.  Interesting, the within term is actually positive in many countries, where increases in
55:2367:128043:14:15:71:539:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the value-added to export ratio in non-manufacturing dominate declines in manufacturing
55:2368:128130:15:14:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(this  can  occur  either  due  to  the  magnitude  of  the  VAX  changes  themselves,  or  because
55:2369:128229:14:14:71:327:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:non-manufacturing has a large weight in exports).
55:2370:128278:14:15:89:539:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Figure D1, we project the components of this Between-Within decomposition on in-
55:2371:128361:15:14:71:539:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:come  growth,  similar  to  Panel  (b)  of  Figure  3.   The  within  term  tends  to  be  positively
55:2372:128462:14:15:71:539:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlated  with  income  growth,  while  the  between  term  tends  to  be  negatively  correlated
55:2373:128561:15:14:71:539:189:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with income growth.  As such,  the fact that growth predicts declines in the overall value-
55:2374:128652:14:15:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:added to export ratio is entirely due to the between term.  That is, fast growing countries
55:2375:128743:15:14:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tend  to  see  the  share  of  manufacturing  in  their  exports  rise,  and  this  drives  the  overall
55:2376:128847:14:15:71:451:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation between declining VAX ratios and growth at the country level.
55:2377:128920:15:14:89:539:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Section 2.2, we discussed how bilateral value-added to gross export ratios respond to
55:2378:129008:14:15:71:539:117:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distance,  and how this response has changed over time.  Here we document this result in
55:2379:129096:15:14:71:539:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a complementary way, which allows us to discuss the role of additional gravity proxies for
55:2380:129186:14:0:71:539:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade costs as well.  Building on Equation (3), we estimate a gravity-type equation in long

56:2385:129543:15:14:71:539:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stand-in variable for conventional gravity proxies included in the regression, with associated

56:2387:129729:15:14:71:539:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proxies to the regression – common language,  common borders (contiguity),  and common
56:2388:129815:14:15:71:155:580:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:colonial origin.52
56:2389:129833:15:14:89:539:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In Table D3, the estimates in Column (1) of Panel A indicate that declines in the ratio
56:2390:129920:14:14:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  value-added  to  gross  exports  are  smaller  for  countries  that  are  farther  apart.   Looking
56:2391:130023:14:15:71:539:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at gross and value-added exports separately, changes in both gross and value-added trade
56:2392:130111:15:14:71:539:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are smaller for countries that are far apart, but distance increasingly dampens gross exports
56:2393:130204:14:15:71:509:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than value-added exports.  These results confirm the results plotted in Figure 4.
56:2394:130290:15:14:89:539:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast to distance, we see that gross and value-added exports respond similarly to
56:2395:130377:14:15:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:other  gravity  proxies  for  trade  costs  in  columns  (2)-(5)  of  Table  D3.   Common  borders,
