2:28:1299:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:This paper studies the relationship between financial structure and the welfare consequences of fixed
2:29:1400:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:exchange rate regimes in small open emerging economies with downward nominal wage rigidity. 
2:30:1492:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:The paper presents two surprising results. First, a pegging economy might be better off with a closed
2:31:1593:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:than with an open capital account. Second, the welfare gain from switching from a peg to the optimal
2:32:1693:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:(full-employment) monetary policy might be larger in financially open economies than in financially

3:47:2065:0:30:72:207:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:48:2080:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A characteristic of the current European crisis is that countries in its periphery have found
3:49:2173:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:themselves increasingly cut off from international financial markets. In the present study,
3:50:2264:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we ask how such changes in the financial structure influence the welfare consequences of
3:51:2352:18:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime. We address this issue in the context of a dynamic
3:52:2443:18:18:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of an emerging economy with involuntary unemployment developed in Schmitt-Groh ́e
3:53:2530:18:18:72:163:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Uribe (2011).
3:54:2547:18:18:89:539:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In that model negative external shocks lead to involuntary unemployment because of the
3:55:2633:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:combination of downward nominal wage rigidity and a currency peg. The mechanism is as
3:56:2718:18:18:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follows. Consider the economy’s adjustment to a negative tradable output shock, such as
3:57:2805:18:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a deterioration in the terms of trade. Households respond to this negative external shock
3:58:2894:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by lowering their demand for consumption goods. In the nontraded sector, the decline in
3:59:2981:18:17:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate demand causes the relative price of nontradables to fall. In turn, firms face lower
3:60:3074:17:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices but unchanged costs. The reason why costs are unchanged is that nominal wages are
3:61:3162:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downwardly rigid and the exchange rate is pegged, so that real wages expressed in terms of
3:62:3252:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tradables are unable to fall. As a result firms demand fewer hours of labor. The resulting
3:63:3342:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underemployment is involuntary because at the going wage rate workers would prefer to work
3:64:3432:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:longer hours. As shown in Schmitt-Groh ́e and Uribe (2011), in this environment the optimal
3:65:3523:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exchange rate policy brings about full employment at all times. It does so by depreciating
3:66:3613:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the value of the domestic currency during periods of low aggregate demand. The resulting
3:67:3701:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:real allocation is Pareto optimal. Elsewhere (Schmitt Groh ́e and Uribe, 2012) we show that
3:68:3792:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this model currency pegs create a pecuniary externality. The nature of the externality is
3:69:3884:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that agents fail to internalize that high current absorption of tradables drives up real wages,
3:70:3979:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which, once the expansion is over, fall only sluggishly (due to nominal rigidities) causing
3:71:4070:18:18:72:241:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underemployment along the way.
3:72:4100:18:17:89:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The contribution of the present paper is to show that the aforementioned externality
3:73:4184:17:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gives rise to two paradoxical results. The first one is that a country with a fixed exchange
3:74:4276:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate regime might enjoy higher welfare under financial autarky than when it has access to an
3:75:4368:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:internationally traded risk-free bond. In a version of the model calibrated to match salient
3:76:4460:18:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:features of the Argentine economy, we find that the fixed-exchange rate economy with access
3:77:4551:18:18:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to an international bond requires an increase in total consumption of two thirds of one
3:78:4638:18:18:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent every period to be as well off as a fixed-exchange rate economy in financial autarky.
3:79:4731:18:18:89:539:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The second paradoxical result is that the welfare cost of pegging the currency may be
3:80:4816:18:18:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger in financially open economies than in financially closed ones. This finding suggests that
3:81:4912:18:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the pressure on central banks to abandon a currency peg in favor of optimal exchange-rate
4:82:5002:0:18:72:353:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy may be larger in the absence of capital controls.
4:83:5058:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is organized in five sections. Section 2 presents the model
4:84:5144:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a small open economy with involuntary unemployment due to downward nominal wage
4:85:5226:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rigidity originally developed in Schmitt-Groh ́e and Uribe (2011).  Section 3 characterizes
4:86:5317:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:welfare under the optimal exchange rate policy and under a currency peg in a financially
4:87:5405:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:autarkic economy. Section 4 introduces an internationally-traded, risk-free bond and shows
4:88:5495:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that in this environment the welfare costs of currency pegs may be higher than under financial
4:89:5589:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:autarky. Section 5 shows that peggers may be better off in a financially closed economy.
4:90:5677:18:45:72:175:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Section 6 concludes.
4:91:5697:45:30:72:194:519:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:2  The Model
4:92:5709:30:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our theoretical framework builds on Schmitt-Groh ́e and Uribe (2011). The model is one
4:93:5795:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a small open economy in which nominal wages are downwardly rigid, giving rise to an
4:94:5881:18:18:72:541:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:occasionally binding constraint. The labor market is assumed to be perfectly competitive.
4:95:5970:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As a result, even though all participants understand that wages are nominally rigid, they do
4:96:6062:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not act strategically in their pricing behavior. Instead, workers and firms take factor prices
4:97:6156:17:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as given. The model features a traded and a nontraded sector and aggregate fluctuations
4:98:6243:18:39:72:412:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are driven by stochastic movements in the supply of traded goods.

5:115:7142:18:18:72:465:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These assumptions imply that tradables and nontradables are normal goods.
5:116:7215:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Households are assumed to be endowed with an exogenous and stochastic amount of

5:118:7384:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the labor market.1Because of the presence of nominal wage rigidities in the labor market,

8:219:12228:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now study the role of exchange rate policy in an environment of financial autarky. To
8:220:12316:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this end, we assume that households are cut off from international capital markets. Because
8:221:12407:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the capital account is closed, consumption of tradables must equal tradable output at all
8:222:12496:18:33:72:399:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:times. As result, the market clearing condition (13) collapses to
8:223:12561:33:33:284:540:591:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:A:cTt=yTt.(14)
8:224:12573:33:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This condition makes it clear that under financial autarky, consumption of tradables inherits
8:225:12666:18:17:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all of the volatility present in tradable output. More importantly for the purpose of our
8:226:12755:17:18:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investigation, as we are about to show, because nominal wages are downwardly rigid, swings
8:227:12845:18:18:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the absorption of tradable goods can potentially spill over to the nontraded sector. While
8:228:12938:18:18:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the monetary authority can do nothing about the volatility in traded consumption, it can,
8:229:13027:18:18:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through appropriate policies, keep those fluctuations from causing unemployment in the
8:230:13113:18:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nontraded sector. Thus, under financial autarky, monetary policy becomes responsible for

8:247:14091:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sumption of tradables is as follows. Given the relative price of nontradables, an increased
8:248:14182:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:desire to consume tradable goods is accompanied by an increased demand for nontradables.
8:249:14270:18:17:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In turn, the elevated demand for nontradables pushes the relative price of these goods up-
8:250:14360:17:18:72:540:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ward, creating an incentive for entrepreneurs to hire more labor.  However, because the
8:251:14447:18:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy is already at full employment in the nontraded sector, the increased demand for
9:252:14535:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:labor causes the real wage to rise to a level at which the quantity of hours demanded by

9:280:15652:18:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It follows from (8) and (15) thatwt= Ω(yTt). Combining this expression with (9) yields

9:283:15752:0:18:128:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:, as claimed. To see that the full-employment allocation is Pareto optimal, simply
9:284:15834:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:note that the processesht= ̄handcTt=yTtfor alltrepresent the solution to the problem of

9:286:16013:18:30:72:452:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:social planner who is not constrained by downward nominal wage rigidity.
9:287:16085:30:18:89:539:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It follows from proposition 1 that when the economy is in financial autarky, the optimal
9:288:16173:18:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exchange-rate policy calls for a devaluation whenever the economy experiences a sufficiently
9:289:16265:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large negative tradable-endowment shock. To see this more transparently, replacewt−1for

9:295:16411:36:18:72:539:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since Ω is strictly increasing, we have that-t>1 whenyTtfalls sufficiently belowyTt−1. The
9:296:16501:18:18:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intuition behind this result is as follows: In response to a fall in tradable output, all other
9:297:16596:18:18:72:540:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:things equal, households feel poorer, and, as a consequence, reduce their demands for both
9:298:16686:18:0:72:540:73:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tradable and nontradable goods. The contraction in the demand for the nontraded good
10:299:16771:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depresses its relative price, which in turn induces firms to cut supply. This causes a fall in
10:300:16865:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the aggregate demand for labor. Full employment, therefore, requires a reduction in the real
10:301:16957:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage,Wt/Et. Because the nominal wage,Wt, is downwardly rigid, however, the required
10:302:17040:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decline in the real wage must be brought about via a depreciation of the domestic currency,
10:303:17131:18:18:72:202:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:i.e., via an increase inEt.
10:304:17158:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Should the central bank fail to devalue the domestic currency in a situation of depressed
10:305:17247:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand for tradables like the one described in the previous paragraph, unemployment would
10:306:17336:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ensue. In this case, a negative shock that originates in the traded sector would spread to the
10:307:17430:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nontraded sector. It follows immediately that a currency peg, defined as an exchange-rate
10:308:17519:18:18:72:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy that sets-t= 1 at all times, is in general not optimal under financial autarky. We
10:309:17608:18:30:72:309:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formalize this result in the following corollary:
10:310:17657:30:18:72:543:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f13:C:Corollary 1 (Nonoptimality of Currency Pegs Under Financial Autarky)Suppose
10:311:17732:18:33:72:499:480:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:C:that the economy is in financial autarky. Then, in general, the exchange-rate policy

10:314:17880:31:18:89:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A natural question is how far the allocation induced by a currency peg is from the Pareto
10:315:17969:18:18:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal allocation. One way to measure this distance, is to gauge how costly it is in terms
10:316:18060:18:18:72:540:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of welfare to adhere to a currency peg as opposed to following the optimal exchange rate
10:317:18148:18:18:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy. This question is essentially quantitative. For this reason, we resort to numerical
10:318:18238:18:17:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simulations. Specifically, using a calibrated version of the model, we compare the levels of

11:353:19852:18:18:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2011) analyze data on unemployment and nominal wage growth in ten peripheral European

11:355:20029:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They show that unemployment increased in all ten countries during this period. At the same

11:357:20211:18:18:72:539:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 13 quarters considered. This means that the smallest implied value ofγin this sample
11:358:20299:18:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is 0.996. Our calibrated value of 0.99 implies that over the 13 quarters considered nominal
11:359:20390:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages could have fallen by 13 percent, which is more than twice the maximum observed
11:360:20474:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage decline. This is the precise sense in which we argue that our choice ofγallows for more
11:361:20566:18:18:72:443:279:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:downward wage flexibility than observed in the recent European crisis.2

14:488:26381:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:play an important role in moderating the negative effects of adverse external shocks. The
14:489:26470:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:root of these large welfare losses is that a currency peg causes unemployment of 9 percent of
14:490:26563:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the labor force on average. By contrast, unemployment is nil at all times under the optimal
14:491:26654:18:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:monetary policy. The key difference between the optimal monetary policy and the currency
14:492:26742:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peg is that the former allows for reductions in the real wage in periods of weak aggregate
14:493:26832:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand.  The standard deviation of real wage changes under the optimal exchange-rate
14:494:26916:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy is significant, 9.2 percent. Recall that these real wage changes are the ones that would
14:495:27011:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:occur in an flexible-wage economy. The optimal policy engineers efficient reductions in real
14:496:27103:18:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wages during recessions by means of appropriate devaluations of the domestic currency. We
14:497:27192:18:23:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find that these devaluations are large. The minimum devaluation rate compatible with full

14:500:27492:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:percent during the period 2008:Q1 to 2011:Q2, which is five times larger than the largest observed decline
14:501:27598:12:0:72:150:95:10:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f12:F:in nominal wages.
15:502:27617:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment is 10.5 percent on average.4By contrast, a currency peg in combination with
15:503:27703:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:downward nominal wage rigidity prevents the downward adjustment of real wages during
15:504:27787:18:18:72:305:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contractions, causing massive unemployment.
15:505:27830:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The rate of unemployment is highly volatile under a currency peg, with a standard
15:506:27911:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deviation of 8.0 percentage points. In turn, the high volatility of unemployment implies a
15:507:28001:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highly volatile supply and consumption of nontradable goods. As result, total consumption
15:508:28090:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is also more volatile under a currency peg than under the optimal policy. The standard
15:509:28176:18:18:72:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deviation of ln(ct), not shown in the table, more than doubles from 3.2 percent under the
15:510:28265:18:44:72:336:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal policy to 7.3 percent under a currency peg.

15:512:28367:28:29:101:149:492:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:Pegs?
15:513:28372:29:18:72:539:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus far, we have established that for the type of shocks considered in our model subop-
15:514:28460:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:timal exchange-rate policy has large negative welfare consequences under financial autarky,
15:515:28551:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:posing great policy challenges to central banks in emerging countries. It would be natural
15:516:28641:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to conjecture that these challenges would become more manageable the more complete asset
15:517:28729:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets are. In this section we show that this conjecture need not hold. We find that the
15:518:28818:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:welfare cost of a currency peg can be higher when financial markets are open than when
15:519:28904:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are closed. This result implies that central banks that peg their currencies have greater
15:520:28998:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incentives to abandon the fixed-exchange-rate regime in favor of the optimal exchange rate

15:522:29178:18:18:72:106:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closed.
15:523:29185:18:18:89:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition behind this result has to do with two opposing forces determining the
15:524:29268:18:17:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:welfare costs of currency pegs, to which we refer as the consumption smoothing versus
15:525:29353:17:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption level tradeoff. One force is the increased ability of financially open economies
15:526:29445:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to insure against tradable endowment shocks. This force tends to reduce the cost of pegs
15:527:29533:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because it reduces the extent to which negative endowment shocks in the traded sector,
15:528:29619:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through their contractionary effects on aggregate absorption, lead to unemployment in the
15:529:29708:18:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nontraded sector under currency pegs. The second force is that the average level of external
15:530:29800:18:18:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:debt is higher in the economy with access to financial markets (see figure 2). As we will
15:531:29889:18:18:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explain shortly, the higher the level of debt, the larger the welfare cost associated with a
15:532:29981:18:18:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peg, because the level of external debt amplifies the volatility of real-wage changes, making
15:533:30074:18:17:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nominal rigidities bind more often. When the second force dominates the first (i.e., when the

18:584:32530:18:18:89:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As in the case of financial autarky, we approximate aggregate dynamics by discretizing

18:587:32794:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exchange-rate policy. The numerical problem is now more complex due to the emergence of
18:588:32881:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two additional state variables: the endogenous statedtand the exogenous statert. We use
18:589:32968:18:18:72:368:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:501 equally spaced points to discretize the debt subspace.
18:590:33026:18:18:89:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:An important difference between the autarkic and one-bond economies is that the latter
18:591:33112:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:features positive debt on average. Figure 2 displays the unconditional distribution of external
18:592:33207:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:debt in the one-bond economy when exchange-rate policy takes the form of an exchange-rate
18:593:33296:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peg. The mean external debt is 3.38, or 26 percent of annual output. The average level
18:594:33382:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of debt in the present environment is determined to a large extent by the assumption that
18:595:33471:18:18:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:agents are impatient (note thatβ(1 +Ert) is less than unity) and by aggregate uncertainty.5
18:596:33562:18:18:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Impatience induces agents to choose debt levels near the natural limit, ̄d, whereas uncertainty
18:597:33657:18:17:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gives an incentive for precautionary savings and, therefore, for keeping debt below the natural
18:598:33752:17:18:72:100:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limit.
18:599:33758:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As in the case of financial autarky, we define the welfare cost of a currency peg vis-`a-vis

18:613:34533:18:18:72:283:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a currency peg in the one-bond economy.
18:614:34572:18:18:89:539:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 shows that the mean welfare cost of a currency peg relative to the optimal

18:616:34750:18:18:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:require a permanent increase in consumption of 12.3 percent to not have incentives to put
18:617:34839:18:18:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pressure on their central bank to abandon the peg. This large welfare cost stems from the
18:618:34928:18:18:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact that the average unemployment rate in the currency-peg economy is 14.5 percent. The

19:628:35413:28:14:101:510:593:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:Note. The welfare cost of a currency peg relative to the optimal policy is computed

19:630:35566:15:14:101:510:564:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:namely, zero (the autarkic level) andEdt= 3.38, whereEdtdenotes the unconditional
19:631:35647:14:15:101:510:550:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:mean of debt in the one-bond economy under a currency peg. The welfare cost of a
19:632:35727:15:14:101:510:535:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:peg is calculated as the percent increase in the consumption process associated with a
19:633:35813:14:47:101:496:521:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:peg required to yield the same level of welfare as the optimal exchange-rate policy.
19:634:35897:47:18:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average cost of pegs in the one-bond economy is much larger than the 6.5 percent obtained
19:635:35986:18:18:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under autarky. Indeed, as can be seen from figure 1, the entire density function of welfare
19:636:36077:18:18:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:costs of pegs in the one-bond economy is located to the right of the corresponding density
19:637:36167:18:18:72:194:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under financial autarky.
19:638:36191:18:18:89:539:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Because the average levels of debt in the autarkic and one-bond economies are so differ-
19:639:36279:18:18:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ent, comparing the relative merits of alternative exchange-rate policies across asset market
19:640:36371:18:18:72:540:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structures is more meaningful at common initial values of the state vector. There are two
19:641:36460:18:18:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:initial conditions that are of particular interest. The first such initial condition is the one in
19:642:36558:18:18:72:539:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which the level of debt equals its autarkic value of zero (d0= 0) and the second is the one
19:643:36649:18:18:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which the level of debt equals its mean in the one-bond economy under a currency peg
19:644:36736:18:17:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(d0= 3.38). Accordingly, we compute the welfare cost of a currency peg for these two values
19:645:36827:17:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of initial debt. For the remaining state variables, we set the initial levels of tradable endow-
19:646:36923:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment and of the real interest rate at their respective unconditional means (yT0=E(yTt) = 1
19:647:37013:18:18:72:541:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:andr0=E(rt) = 0.0316) and the initial value of the past real wage at the full-employment
19:648:37101:18:18:72:394:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level when tradable consumption is unity (w−1= Ω(1) = 2.13).
19:649:37161:18:18:89:539:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 shows that the welfare cost of pegs are also extremely high at the initial conditions
19:650:37254:18:18:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considered. In all four cases, agents in the peg economy require an increase of more than
19:651:37343:18:18:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3.5 percent of the entire consumption process to be as well off as in the optimal-exchange-
19:652:37434:18:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate-policy economy. A novel result of the present investigation is that the welfare cost of
19:653:37526:18:18:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a currency peg relative to the optimal exchange-rate policy is larger when the economy is
19:654:37615:18:18:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financially open than when it is financially closed. Specifically, table 3 shows that conditional
19:655:37712:18:18:72:539:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the initial net foreign asset position being zero (d0= 0), the welfare cost of a currency
19:656:37804:18:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peg relative to the optimal exchange-rate policy in the autarkic economy is 3.7 percent,
20:657:37894:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:almost two percentage points lower than the corresponding conditional welfare cost in the
20:658:37983:18:18:72:312:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financially open economy, which is 5.4 percent.
20:659:38030:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This result is surprising because one might expect that as financial markets become more
20:660:38118:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complete, agents would be able to better insure against external shocks, making suboptimal
20:661:38208:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy less harmful. The result is due to the fact that under a currency peg the average
20:662:38296:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment rate is larger in the one-bond economy than in the autarkic economy (14.5
20:663:38382:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:versus 9.0 percent). The intuition why a peg creates more unemployment in the one-bond
20:664:38468:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy than in the closed economy is clear, but a bit involved. It has to do with the fact that
20:665:38564:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the one-bond economy has on average a positive level of external debt, whereas the autarkic
20:666:38655:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy features no debt by construction.  In the one-bond economy, under a currency
20:667:38739:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peg, the debt-to-output ratio is 0.26 per year. This debt requires the allocation of some
20:668:38828:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tradable output to paying interest. As a result, households optimally choose an average level
20:669:38921:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of tradable consumption that is lower than the corresponding level in the autarkic economy
20:670:39011:18:18:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(0.9 versus 1.0). This means that a given shock to the tradable endowment represents a larger
20:671:39104:18:17:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share of traded consumption in the one-bond economy than in the autarkic economy. This
20:672:39190:17:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:translates into higher volatility of the growth rate of tradable consumption (5.1 percent in the
20:673:39286:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-bond economy versus 4.1 percent in the autarkic economy). Recalling that the flexible-
20:674:39376:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wage real wage, Ω(cTt), is a function of tradable consumption alone (see equation (15)),
20:675:39464:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we have that a higher variance of tradable consumption growth is associated with a higher
20:676:39553:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility of the flexible-wage real wage growth (18.1 percent in the one-bond economy versus
20:677:39646:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:9.2 percent in the autarkic economy). In turn, a higher volatility in the growth rate of the
20:678:39738:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flexible-wage real wage means that under a peg the constraint on nominal wages will bind
20:679:39826:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more often, which implies that the one-bond economy will experience unemployment more
20:680:39911:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:often than the autarkic economy. Finally, more frequent unemployment spells are welfare
20:681:39998:18:18:72:457:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decreasing as they reduce the supply and consumption of nontraded goods.
20:682:40070:18:18:89:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our intuition for why a currency peg is more costly in the one-bond economy than under
20:683:40156:18:18:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:autarky suggests that this result could be overturned if one were to define financial autarky as
20:684:40252:18:17:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a situation in which the country is forced to run a balanced current account in every period—
20:685:40345:17:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that the level of external debt stays constant over time—but carries a debt burden equal
20:686:40436:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the average external debt in the one-bond economy with a fixed-exchange-rate policy.
20:687:40523:18:33:72:403:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Under this definition of financial autarky, equation (14) becomes

21:694:40783:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:external debt in the one-bond economy with a fixed-exchange-rate regime. This experiment
21:695:40871:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amounts to eliminating the consumption-level force from the consumption-smoothing versus
21:696:40959:18:18:72:210:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption-level tradeoff.
21:697:40986:18:18:89:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 3 shows that the welfare cost of a peg relative to the optimal exchange-rate policy
21:698:41075:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditional on the initial debt being equal to 3.38 is 9.6 percent, slightly below the welfare
21:699:41169:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of a currency peg in the autarkic economy with external debt equal to 3.38 at all times.
21:700:41262:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This result is more intuitive and is due to the fact that in the autarkic economy tradable
21:701:41352:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumption is on average lower than when debt was fixed at zero. As a result a given shock
21:702:41443:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the endowment of tradables causes a larger percent increase in tradable consumption. In
21:703:41533:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:addition, the autarkic economy is now hit by an additional shock, the interest rate, which
21:704:41623:18:45:72:394:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adds even more volatility to the tradable consumption process.

21:706:41726:30:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Consider a country that is highly committed to a peg. We have in mind arrangements like
21:707:41813:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the eurozone in which breaking away from the common currency appears difficult for reasons
21:708:41903:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that go beyond the state of the business cycle. In this section, we investigate whether, given
21:709:41997:17:18:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the country is pegging the exchange rate, it would be desirable to restrict capital account
21:710:42093:18:18:72:506:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transactions as a way to reduce the inefficiencies caused by negative external shocks.
21:711:42179:18:18:89:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We address this issue by considering two economies in which the currency is fixed. In
21:712:42264:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one economy the capital account is closed (possibly through explicit government regulation).
21:713:42356:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As in previous sections, we refer to this economy as the autarkic economy. In the second
21:714:42444:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy, the capital account is unrestricted. Households have access to an internationally
21:715:42534:18:18:72:480:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:traded bond. As before, we refer to this environment as the one-bond economy.
21:716:42611:18:18:89:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The specific question we aim to answer is whether it could be that closing the capital
21:717:42697:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account is desirable. In the absence of downward nominal wage rigidity, the answer is trivially
21:718:42792:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no. For given identical initial conditions, welfare must be higher in the economy with an
21:719:42881:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:open capital account. The result follows directly from the facts that under flexible wages
21:720:42971:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal and that the autarkic allocation is feasible in
21:721:43064:18:17:72:190:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the one-bond economy.
21:722:43085:17:18:89:539:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When wages are downwardly rigid, however, it is no longer the case that welfare must be
21:723:43172:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher in the financially open economy than in the closed one. The reason is that the cur-
21:724:43262:18:18:72:541:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rency peg economy with wage rigidity (whether open or closed) has a pecuniary externality.
21:725:43352:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The nature of this externality has to do with the fact that, in states in which aggregate ab-
21:726:43445:18:18:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sorption contracts sufficiently, the lower bound on nominal wages binds, causing involuntary
21:727:43537:18:0:72:540:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment. The household understands this mechanism, but, because of its atomistic
22:728:43624:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature, is unable to internalize the fact that its individual expenditure contributes to the
22:729:43716:18:18:72:221:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generation of unemployment.
22:730:43743:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Whether agents are better or worse off in the open economy than under financial autarky
22:731:43830:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the result of a tradeoff. On the one hand, opening the current account provides households
22:732:43923:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a financial instrument to smooth consumption. On the other hand, opening the current
22:733:44012:18:18:72:541:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account induces households to accumulate foreign debt, which aggravates the inefficiencies
22:734:44102:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introduced by the pecuniary externality. The reason why the inefficiencies are larger the
22:735:44191:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger is the net debt position is that, as explained earlier, traded consumption is lower on
22:736:44284:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average in economies with larger levels of external debt, because resources must be devoted
22:737:44375:18:18:72:541:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to servicing the external obligations.  This implies that external shocks have a relatively
22:738:44466:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger effect on traded consumption the larger the average level of external debt. And higher
22:739:44559:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility of traded consumption growth causes the lower bound on nominal wages to bind
22:740:44646:18:18:72:130:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more often.
22:741:44657:18:18:89:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We define the welfare cost of financial autarky for peggers as the percent increase in the

23:783:46764:14:15:101:510:535:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:process associated with financial autarky in a pegging economy required to yield the
23:784:46848:15:14:101:510:520:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:same level of welfare as the one enjoyed by households in the one-bond economy under

23:786:46938:47:18:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:means. The initial past real wage is set at the full-employment level when traded absorption
23:787:47030:18:18:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equals unity. The table reveals the surprising result that a pegging economy would be better
23:788:47122:18:18:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off never opening its capital account. That is, welfare is higher under financial autarky than
23:789:47216:18:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the one-bond economy. And the welfare cost of liberalizing the capital account, at two
23:790:47305:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thirds of one percent, is sizable.  As explained above, the reason for this finding is that

23:795:47722:18:18:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account in a situation in which its external debt is sufficiently high.  To show this, we
23:796:47811:18:18:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:redefine autarky to mean a situation in which the current account is zero at all times, but
23:797:47902:18:18:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the level of debt is positive (and constant). Equation (21) displays the country’s resource
23:798:47993:18:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraint under this definition of autarky. In terms of the notation of that equation, we
23:799:48083:18:18:72:539:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:setda, the constant level of external debt, at 3.38, which equals the unconditional mean
23:800:48171:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of debt in the one-bond economy under a peg. Table 4 shows that in this case the welfare
23:801:48259:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of autarky is 0.9 percent of consumption. This means that a country with a significant
23:802:48350:18:18:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amount of debt (26 percent of output) is worse off closing its capital account. The intuition
23:803:48443:18:18:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for this result is clear. Closing the capital account when the level of external debt is high
23:804:48536:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not ameliorate the inefficiencies introduced by the combination of wage rigidity and a
23:805:48627:18:17:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fixed exchange rate, but does prevent the economy from smoothing consumption through
23:806:48711:17:18:72:175:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the current account.
23:807:48731:18:0:89:540:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This result suggests that if a country that is a member of a currency union, such as Greece,
24:808:48825:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defaults (bringing its external debt close to zero) but decides to stick to the currency union,
24:809:48920:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it would be better off preventing its citizens from borrowing abroad. Curiously, individual
24:810:49011:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:agents would prefer the lifting of such capital controls.  Therefore, a referendum asking
24:811:49100:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:people’s opinion on the adoption of capital controls would fail.  But society as a whole
24:812:49188:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would be badly served by capital account liberalization, because of the pecuniary externality
24:813:49281:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identified above. On the other hand, if the indebted economy chose to neither default nor
24:814:49370:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:abandon the currency union, then it would find it in its own interest to keep the current
24:815:49459:18:45:72:423:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account open to allow households to smooth consumption over time.
24:816:49524:45:30:72:193:537:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6  Conclusion
24:817:49537:30:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we study the role of financial market structure in determining the welfare
24:818:49626:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of currency pegs in small open emerging economies. The central friction in the
24:819:49717:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theoretical framework we use in our analysis is downward nominal wage rigidity. This nomi-
24:820:49807:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nal rigidity in combination with a fixed exchange rate regime gives rise to downward rigidity
24:821:49900:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in real wages. Therefore, negative external shocks, such as terms-of-trade deteriorations or
24:822:49992:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases in the country interest rate, cause involuntary unemployment, as wages fall only
24:823:50082:17:18:72:258:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sluggishly to clear the labor market.
24:824:50119:18:18:89:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The frictions embedded in our model give rise to two surprising results. First, a pegging
24:825:50208:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy might be better off with a closed than with an open capital account.  Second,
24:826:50293:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the welfare gain from switching from a peg to the optimal (full-employment) exchange-rate
24:827:50382:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy might be larger in financially open economies than in financially closed ones. This
24:828:50472:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:finding suggests that central banks in financially open economies have greater incentives to
24:829:50564:18:18:72:204:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:avoid hard currency pegs.
24:830:50589:18:18:89:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One avenue along which the analysis presented in this paper could profitably be extended
24:831:50677:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is to introduce a meaningful reason for firms to hold dollarized liabilities. Such a modification
24:832:50774:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has the potential to counterbalance the expansionary effect of devaluations stressed here and
24:833:50867:18:0:72:357:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in that way enhance the appeal of fixed exchange rates.
