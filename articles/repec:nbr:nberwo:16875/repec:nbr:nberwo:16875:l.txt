2:33:1780:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Motivated by the literature on limits-to-arbitrage, we build an equilibrium model of commodity markets
2:34:1882:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in which speculators are capital constrained, and commodity producers have hedging demands for
2:35:1976:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:commodity futures. Increases (decreases) in producers' hedging demand (speculators' risk-capacity)
2:36:2074:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures, reduce producers' inventory holdings, and thus
2:37:2174:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:spot prices. Consistent with our model, producers' default risk forecasts futures returns, spot prices,
2:38:2277:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and inventories in oil and gas market data from 1980-2006, and the component of the commodity 
2:39:2371:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces.
2:40:2472:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect both
2:41:2575:14:42:72:182:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:asset and goods prices.

3:63:2997:0:28:72:201:691:209:g_d0_f2:209:g_d0_f2:C:1Introduction
3:64:3010:28:16:72:539:663:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The neoclassical theory of asset pricing (Debreu (1959)) has been confronted by theory and evidence
3:65:3109:16:17:72:539:647:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that highlight the numerous frictions faced byfinancial intermediaries in undertaking arbitrage
3:66:3204:17:16:72:539:630:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(Shleifer and Vishny (1997)), and the consequent price effects of such frictions. These price effects
3:67:3305:16:16:71:539:614:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:appear to be amplified in situations in whichfinancial intermediaries are substantially on one side
3:68:3404:16:17:71:539:598:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the market (say, for instance, when they bear the prepayment and default risk of households in
3:69:3501:17:16:71:539:581:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:mortgage markets, or when they provide catastrophe insurance to households, as in Froot (1999)).
3:70:3597:16:17:71:539:565:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we apply the “limits to arbitrage” view to the analysis of commodity futures markets,
3:71:3697:17:16:71:539:548:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:asignificant sector of the economy that has recently experienced significant asset price movements
3:72:3795:16:17:71:539:532:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as well as a renewed surge of attention fromfinancial economists. In our theoretical model, com-
3:73:3891:17:16:71:539:515:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:modity investment funds — speculators — are are constrained in their ability to deploy capital in the
3:74:3992:16:16:71:539:499:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity futures market, and meet demands for hedging that come from commodity producing
3:75:4081:16:17:71:539:483:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms. The model, as well as our empirical analysis,reveals that this limit to arbitrage translates
3:76:4180:17:16:71:539:466:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:into “limits to hedging” experienced by producers, which in turn impacts real variables such as the
3:77:4279:16:17:71:178:450:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spot commodity price.
3:78:4300:17:16:88:539:433:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:More specifically, the limit on the risk-taking capacity of speculators implies a price impact of
3:79:4397:16:17:71:539:417:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the hedging demand of risk-averse producers, who are naturally short commodity futures. This price
3:80:4495:17:16:71:540:400:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:impact constitutes a cost of hedging, which has consequences for the optimal inventory holding of
3:81:4592:16:16:71:540:384:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity producers, and in turn, the commodityspot price. We derive implications of producer
3:82:4685:16:17:71:539:368:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk aversion and speculator capital constraints for the absolute and relative levels of futures and
3:83:4785:17:16:71:540:351:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spot prices. To understand the comparative statics generated by the model, consider the following
3:84:4882:16:17:71:539:335:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:example: assume that producers as a whole need to hedge more by shorting futures contracts,
3:85:4973:17:16:71:540:318:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:say, on account of their rising default risk. Given that speculators are limited in their ability to
3:86:5073:16:17:71:539:302:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:take positions to satisfy this demand, it depresses futures prices and makes hedging more expensive.
3:87:5173:17:16:71:539:285:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Consequently, producers scale back on holding inventory, releasing it into the market and depressing
3:88:5273:16:17:71:539:269:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spot prices. Therefore, futures risk premia and expected percentage change in the spot price have
3:89:5370:17:16:71:539:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a common driver — the hedging demand of producers.  Due to this common driver, the model
3:90:5458:16:16:71:539:236:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:also predicts that the commodity convenience yield (or basis) should not be strongly related to
3:91:5553:16:17:71:530:220:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity futures risk premia. Increases in speculators’ capital constraints have similar effects.
3:92:5651:17:16:88:539:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To test the implications of our model, we employ data on spot and futures prices for heating oil,
3:93:5748:16:17:71:539:187:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:crude oil, gasoline and natural gas over the period 1980 to 2006. To identify changes in producers’
3:94:5847:17:16:71:539:170:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk aversion and hedging demand, we use movements in the default risk of commodity producing
3:95:5940:16:16:71:538:154:121:g_d0_f4:121:g_d0_f3:B:firms, an identification strategy driven by extant theoretical and empirical work on hedging.1We
3:96:6036:16:15:84:539:138:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:1A large body of theoretical work and empirical evidence on hedging has attributed managerial aversion to risk
3:97:6146:15:11:72:539:123:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:as a primary motive for hedging byfirms (Amihud and Lev (1981), Tufano (1996), Acharya, Amihud and Litov
3:98:6250:11:11:71:540:112:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:(2007), and Gormley and Matsa (2008), among others); and has documented that top managers suffer significantly
3:99:6360:11:0:71:539:101:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:fromfiring and job relocation difficulties whenfirms default (Gilson (1989), Baird and Rasmussen (2006) and Ozelge
4:100:6475:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:employ three different aggregate measures of the default risk of oil and gas producers in our work:
4:101:6574:17:16:72:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a balance-sheet based measure — the Zmijewski (1984) score; a measure that combines market data
4:102:6669:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with balance-sheet data — the Moody’s KMV’s expected default frequency; and a pure market-based
4:103:6764:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measure — the lagged three-year stock return of these producers. Ourfindings are as follows: First,
4:104:6863:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity producer default risk is positively related to both aggregate and individual producer
4:105:6958:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging demand. The latter is measured using information from the FAS 133 disclosures in annual
4:106:7053:16:16:72:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and quarterly reports, while the former is measuredas the net short positions of market participants
4:107:7153:16:17:72:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:classified as ‘hedgers’ by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Second, an increase
4:108:7248:17:16:72:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the default risk of producers forecasts an increase in the excess returns on short-term futures of
4:109:7349:16:17:72:539:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:these commodities. The effect is robust to business-cycle conditions and economically significant:
4:110:7447:17:16:72:539:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a one standard deviation increase in the aggregate commodity sector default risk is on average
4:111:7541:16:17:72:539:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:associated with a 4% increase in the respective commodity’s quarterly futures risk premium.2Third,
4:112:7639:17:16:72:540:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the effect of the default risk of producers on futures risk premia is greater in periods with higher
4:113:7739:16:17:72:540:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(conditional) volatility of commodity prices, consistent with such periods being associated with
4:114:7835:17:16:72:540:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:greater risk of commodity stock outs and a lower risk appetite in thefinancial intermediation sector.
4:115:7936:16:16:72:539:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Fourth, wefind that the fraction of the futures risk premium attributable toproducers’ default
4:116:8030:16:17:71:539:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk is higher in periods in which broker-dealer balance-sheets and the assets under management
4:117:8125:17:16:71:539:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of commodity-focused funds are shrinking (these two measures of speculator risk appetite also
4:118:8218:16:17:71:540:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:predict futures risk premia, consistent with our model). Finally, as producer default risk increases,
4:119:8319:17:16:71:539:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:our model predicts that producers will hold less inventory, depressing current spot prices. This
4:120:8415:16:17:71:540:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:prediction is also confirmed in the data — increases in the default risk of oil and gas producers
4:121:8512:17:16:71:326:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:predict both lower inventory and higher spot returns.
4:122:8565:16:16:88:539:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We verify that our results are driven by changes in producer hedging demand in a number of
4:123:8655:16:17:71:539:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ways. First, we employ a “matching” approach. In particular, we separate the sample of producers
4:124:8751:17:16:71:539:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:into thosefirms that hedge commodity price exposure using derivatives (identified by their FAS
4:125:8845:16:17:72:540:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:133 disclosures between 1998-2006), versus those that do not hedge. We show that our results are
4:126:8941:17:16:72:539:263:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:drivenonlyby measures of aggregate hedging demand derived from thefirms that hedge. Second,
4:127:9032:16:17:72:539:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we account for the possibility that default risk of commodity producers may be related to business-
4:128:9131:17:16:72:539:230:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cycle conditions that also drive risk premiums. In particular, we employ controls in our forecasting
4:129:9231:16:16:72:540:214:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:regressions, in the form of variables commonly employed to predict the equity premium, such as
4:130:9325:16:17:72:540:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:changes in forecasts of GDP growth, the risk-free rate, the term spread, and the aggregate default
4:131:9423:17:16:72:540:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spread, and confirm that our results are unaffected by the introduction of these controls. Third,
4:132:9520:16:17:72:540:165:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from the set of commodityfirms that are included in our Crude Oil measures, we separate out pure
4:133:9616:17:20:72:540:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:play refiners from those that extract (or extract and refine) the commodity. Since refiners use crude
4:134:9717:20:11:72:539:128:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:(2007)). Fehle and Tsyplakov (2005) argue, both theoretically and empirically, thatfirms hedge more actively when
4:135:9830:11:7:71:157:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:default risk is higher.
4:136:9853:7:0:84:537:110:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:2Futures risk premia are identified through standard forecasting regressions as in, e.g., Fama and French (1987).
5:137:9967:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:oil as an input, their hedging demand is likely to be in the opposite direction to that of producers
5:138:10067:17:16:72:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:—weverifythisdifferential effect in the data. Finally, we employ controls that are commodity
5:139:10159:16:17:71:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specific, such as the basis, inventory, lagged futuresreturn, and the realized variance of futures
5:140:10257:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns in our specifications. This is to control for the possibility that producer default risk - an
5:141:10358:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:endogenous variable - may also be related to supply uncertainty, in the form of the likelihood of
5:142:10455:17:16:72:539:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:inventory stock-outs or other production shocks. Our model predicts that such supply uncertainty
5:143:10551:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is related to the variance of the commodity price, but that increases in producer risk aversion
5:144:10646:16:17:72:539:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:should have effects as outlined earlier, even after controlling for this effect. The empirics confirm
5:145:10747:17:16:72:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that default risk, our proxy for producer risk aversion, continues to explain futures risk premia after
5:146:10850:16:17:72:540:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the introduction of these controls, indeed, there is an interactive effect of this predictive power with
5:147:10954:17:16:72:539:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:realized futures return variance as predicted bythe model. To summarize, our model implies that
5:148:11049:16:17:72:539:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:limits to arbitrage generate limits to hedging forfirms in the real economy. Consequently, factors
5:149:11147:17:16:72:539:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that capture time-variation in such limits have predictive power for asset prices and affect outcomes
5:150:11248:16:17:71:539:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in underlying product markets (spot prices and inventories). Our empirical results are consistent
5:151:11345:17:16:71:487:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with the implications of the model and robust to a number of alternative explanations.
5:152:11431:16:16:88:539:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the introduction relates our paper to the literature.  Section 2 introduces
5:153:11523:16:17:71:539:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:our model. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy. Section 4 establishes the link between the
5:154:11619:17:16:71:539:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging demand of commodity producers and measures of their default risk at the individualfirm
5:155:11713:16:17:72:474:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:level. Section 5 discusses our main, aggregate empirical results. Section 6 concludes.
5:156:11799:17:16:88:540:378:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f3:A:Related Literature.There are two classic views on the behavior of commodity forward and
5:157:11886:16:17:72:540:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures prices. TheTheory of Normal Backwardation(Keynes (1930)), states that speculators, who
5:158:11980:17:16:72:540:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:take the long side of a commodity futures position, require a risk premium for hedging the spot price
5:159:12081:16:16:72:540:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:exposure of producers (an early version of the “limits to arbitrage” argument). The risk premium
5:160:12177:16:17:72:540:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:on long forward positions is thus increasing in the amount of demand pressure from hedgers and
5:161:12271:17:16:72:540:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:should be related to observed hedger and speculator positions in the commodity forward markets.
5:162:12366:16:17:72:540:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Carter, Rausser and Schmitz (1983), Chang (1985), Bessembinder (1992), and de Roon, Nijman,
5:163:12457:17:16:72:540:263:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and Veld (2000) empirically link this “hedging pressure” to futures excess returns, the basis and
5:164:12554:16:17:72:357:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the convenience yield, as evidence in support of this theory.
5:165:12615:17:16:88:540:230:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:TheTheory of Storage(Kaldor (1939), Working (1949), and Brennan (1958)), on the other
5:166:12700:16:16:72:540:214:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hand, postulates that forward prices are driven by optimal inventory management. In particular,
5:167:12795:16:17:72:539:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:this theory introduces the notion of aconvenience yieldto explain why anyone would hold inventory
5:168:12892:17:16:72:540:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in periods in which spot prices are expected to decline.  Tests of the theory include Fama and
5:169:12986:16:17:72:540:165:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:French (1987) and Ng and Pirrong (1994). In more recent work, Routledge, Seppi and Spatt (2000)
5:170:13081:17:16:72:540:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:introduce a forward market into the optimal inventory management model of Deaton and Laroque
5:171:13173:16:17:72:540:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(1992) and show that time-varying convenience yields, consistent with those observed in the data,
5:172:13270:17:16:72:325:115:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:can arise even in the presence of risk-neutral agents.3
5:173:13325:16:0:84:543:99:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:3There is a large literature on reduced form, no-arbitragemodelingofcommodityfuturesprices(e.g.,Brennan
6:174:13429:0:17:88:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The two theories are not mutually exclusive.  A time-varying risk premium on forwards is
6:175:13517:17:16:71:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with optimal inventory management if producers are not risk-neutral or face (say) bank-
6:176:13615:16:17:71:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ruptcy costs; and speculator capital is not unlimited, as in our model. In the data, wefind that
6:177:13711:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedgers are net short forwards on average, while speculators are net long, which indicates that
6:178:13806:16:17:71:539:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producers do have hedging demands.  In support of this view, Haushalter (2000, 2001) surveys
6:179:13898:17:16:71:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:100 oil and gas producers over the 1992 to 1994 period andfinds that close to 50 percent of them
6:180:13994:16:16:71:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedge, in the amount of approximately a quarter of their production each year. In a recent paper,
6:181:14091:16:17:71:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Gorton, Hayashi, and Rouwenhorst (2007) provide evidence that futuresrisk premia are related
6:182:14183:17:16:71:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to inventory levels. Consistent with theirfindings, our model also predicts that inventory should
6:183:14280:16:17:71:540:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:forecast commodity futures returns. In our model, this results is driven by the interaction between
6:184:14379:17:16:71:539:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:capital-constrained speculators and producer hedging demand, proxied by measures of producer de-
6:185:14475:16:17:71:539:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:fault risk. Our empirical contribution is to identify that this default risk measure helps to explain
6:186:14576:17:16:71:508:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity spot prices, risk premia, CFTC hedging pressure measures and inventory levels.
6:187:14664:16:17:88:539:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In closely related work, Hirshleifer (1988, 1989, 1990) considers the interaction between hedgers
6:188:14761:17:16:71:539:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and arbitrageurs.  In particular, Hirshleifer(1990) observes that in equilibrium there must be
6:189:14855:16:16:71:539:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:a friction to investing in commodity futures in order for hedging demand to affect prices and
6:190:14948:16:17:71:539:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:quantities. In our model, this friction arises due to limited movement of capital, motivated by the
6:191:15047:17:16:71:539:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:‘limits to arbitrage’ literature, and hedging demand of producers, motivated by a principal-agent
6:192:15144:16:17:71:539:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:problem as the commodityfirm is ultimately owned by the consumers. Furthermore, our analysis,
6:193:15237:17:16:71:540:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:unlike Hirshleifer’s, is also empirical. As a usefulconsequence, in addition to providing evidence
6:194:15335:16:17:71:540:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for our model, we are able to confirm many of the propositions of Hirshleifer’s (1988, 1989, 1990)
6:195:15433:17:16:71:540:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:theoretical models, using a different approach than that in Bessembinder (1992). Another related
6:196:15529:16:16:71:540:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:paper is by Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002), who show that hedging demand affects spot and
6:197:15618:16:17:71:539:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures prices in electricity markets when producers are risk averse. They highlight that the absence
6:198:15719:17:16:71:539:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of storage is what allows for predictable intertemporal variation in equilibrium prices. We show in
6:199:15818:16:17:71:539:280:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:this paper that the price impact can arise even in the presence of storage in the oil and gas markets.
6:200:15920:17:16:88:539:263:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, it has proven difficult to explain the unconditional risk premiums on commodity fu-
6:201:16012:16:17:71:539:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tures using traditional asset pricing theory (see Jagannathan, (1985) for an earlier effort). Although
6:202:16114:17:16:71:539:230:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:conditional risk premiums on commodity futures do appear to be reliably non-zero (see Bessem-
6:203:16207:16:16:71:539:214:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:binder (1992)), Bessembinder and Chan (1992) document that the forecastability of price changes
6:204:16302:16:17:71:539:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in commodity futures is based on different asset pricing factors as compared to equity markets.
6:205:16397:17:16:71:539:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Furthermore, in a recent paper, Tang and Xiong (2009) show that the correlation between com-
6:206:16489:16:17:71:539:165:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:modity and equity markets increases in the amount of speculator capitalflowing to commodity
6:207:16580:17:16:71:539:148:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:markets. These results are consistent with our assumption of time-varying market segmentation
6:208:16673:16:20:71:265:132:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:between equity and commodity markets.

7:244:19152:15:10:71:539:164:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:does not correspond exactly with the evidence - for instance airlines have been known periodically to hedge their

8:280:21286:17:16:71:539:243:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:however, the current demand shock is sufficiently high, an inventory stock-out occurs (i.e.,0),
8:281:21383:16:16:71:540:227:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and current spot prices can rise above expected future spot prices. In such a circumstance,firms

8:283:21586:15:7:72:523:196:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:creates a role for inventory management, is that it is prohibitively costly to change production in the short-run.
8:284:21700:7:15:84:539:189:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:6The literature on corporate hedging provides several justifications for this modeling choice. Hedging demand
8:285:21809:15:11:71:539:174:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:could result from managers being underdiversified, as in Amihud and Lev (1981) and Stulz (1984), or better informed
8:286:21924:11:11:71:539:163:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:about the risks faced by thefirm (Breeden and Viswanathan (1990), and DeMarzo and Duffie (1995)). Managers
8:287:22030:11:11:71:540:152:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:could also be averse to variance on account of private costs suffered upon distress, as documented by Gilson (1989) for
8:288:22149:11:11:71:540:141:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:example, or thefirm may face deadweight costs offinancial distress, as argued by Smith and Stulz (1985). Aversion
8:289:22262:11:7:71:540:130:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to earnings volatility can also be generated from costs of externalfinancing as in Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993).
8:290:22382:7:15:84:539:123:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:7The setup implicitly assumes that the equity-holders cannot write a complete contract with the managers, on
8:291:22490:15:0:71:342:108:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:account of (for instance) incentive reasons as in Holmstrom (1979).
9:292:22558:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:wish to have negative inventory, but cannot. Thus, aconvenience yield for holding the spot arises,
9:293:22656:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as those who hold the spot in the event of a stock-out get to sell at a temporarily high price. This

9:296:22948:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reduces the amount of earnings variance that the producer would otherwise be exposed to. Thus,

10:336:25057:0:17:88:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The basis is not a good measure of the futures risk premium when inventories are positive.
10:337:25147:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Producers in the model can obtain exposure to future commodity prices in one of two ways — either
10:338:25244:16:17:71:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by going long a futures contract, or by holding inventory. In equilibrium, the marginal payofffrom
10:339:25342:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:these strategies must coincide. Thus, producers managing inventory enforce a common component

10:341:25535:17:16:71:539:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:prediction of the model is borne out in our empirical results, and is consistent with thefindings of
10:342:25635:16:32:71:191:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Fama and French (1987).
10:343:25658:32:24:72:170:560:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:2.3  Speculators
10:344:25674:24:16:72:539:536:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Speculators take the long positions that offset producers’ naturally short positions, and allow the
10:345:25773:16:17:71:540:520:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:market to clear. We assume that these speculators are specialized investment management com-
10:346:25865:17:16:71:539:503:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:panies, with superior investment ability in the commodity futures market (e.g., commodity hedge
10:347:25960:16:16:71:540:487:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:funds and investment bank commodity trading desks). As a consequence of this superior invest-
10:348:26053:16:17:71:540:471:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ment technology, investors in otherfinancial assets (the equity-holders) only invest in commodity
10:349:26150:17:16:71:539:454:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:markets by delegating their investments to these specialized funds. As in Berk and Green (2004),
10:350:26246:16:17:71:539:438:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the managers of these funds extract all the surplus ofthis activity and the outside investors only get
10:351:26348:17:16:71:540:421:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:theirfairriskcompensation.Thepayoffto the fund manager per long futures contract is therefore
10:352:26441:16:17:71:539:405:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:[Λ(1−)], making the net present value for equity-holders of investing in a commodity fund
10:353:26533:17:16:71:229:388:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:zero, as dictated by no-arbitrage.
10:354:26567:16:17:88:540:372:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The commodity fund managers are assumed to be risk-neutral, but they are subject to capital
10:355:26658:17:16:71:540:355:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:constraints. These constraintscould arise from costs of leverage such as margin requirements, as
10:356:26754:16:16:71:539:339:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:well as from value-at-risk (VaR) limits. We model these capital constraints as proportional to the
10:357:26852:16:17:71:539:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:variance of the fund’s position, in the spirit of a VaR constraint, as in Danielsson, Shin, and Zigrand

10:373:27360:15:11:72:540:144:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:capital constraints in commodity futures pricing. Gromb and Vayanos (2002) show in an equilibrium setting that

10:376:27702:11:11:72:540:111:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:He and Xiong (2008) show that narrow investment mandates and capital immobility are natural outcomes of an

11:378:27903:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures positions. If commodity funds were not subject to any constraints (i.e.,=0), the market
11:379:28000:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:clearing futures price would be the same as that which would prevail if markets were frictionless;

11:381:28196:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:previously, and the futures risk premium would be independent of the level of managerial risk

12:466:30903:16:17:88:539:379:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The optimal inventory is decreasing in both producer and speculator hedging demand,  unless
12:467:30994:17:28:71:165:362:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:C:there is a stock-out.
12:468:31015:28:16:88:539:334:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition for these results is as follows. When producers’ fundamental hedging demand ()
12:469:31109:16:17:71:540:318:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increases, the manager’s sensitivity to the risk of holding unhedged inventory increases. In response
12:470:31210:17:16:71:539:301:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to this, the manager reduces inventory and increases the proportion of future supply that is hedged.
12:471:31310:16:17:71:539:285:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The former means that more of the commodity is sold on the spot market, which depresses current
12:472:31405:17:16:71:540:268:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spot prices and raises future spot prices. The latter leads to a higher variance-adjusted demand
12:473:31501:16:17:71:539:252:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for short futures contracts, which is accommodated by increasing the futures risk premium. An
12:474:31594:17:16:71:539:235:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increase in speculator capital constraints,,hassimilareffect. The cost of hedging now increases
12:475:31691:16:16:71:539:219:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as the speculators require a higher compensation per unit of risk. The direct effect of this is to
12:476:31789:16:16:71:540:203:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:decrease the number of short futures positions. However, this leaves the producer more exposed to
12:477:31886:16:15:80:539:187:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:10Since producer hedging demand and limits to arbitrage both affect the optimal supply (inventory) of the com-
12:478:31996:15:11:71:539:172:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:modity, the volatility of futures returns is also affected, meaning that the frictions assumed in the commodity market
12:479:32114:11:11:71:539:161:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:also show up in the standard risk adjustment (the covariance term). Thus, there is a component of the futures risk
12:480:32228:11:11:71:539:150:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:premium that originates from limits to arbitrage and hedging demand that cannot be separately observed from the
12:481:32339:11:11:71:539:139:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:standard risk adjustment. Symmetrically, if the volatility and mean of the demand shocks change, this is reflected
12:482:32453:11:11:71:539:128:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:in the volatility of the futures return which also shows up in the futures risk premium term due to hedging demand
12:483:32567:11:11:71:539:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:and limits to arbitrage. In the Appendix, we further discuss the interaction between the frictions proposed here and

13:487:32943:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the inventory is constant (at zero) and consequently so are the expected spot price and its variance.
13:488:33044:16:17:71:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In that case, the only effect of an increase in producer (or speculator) risk aversion is the direct
13:489:33144:17:16:71:439:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the futures risk premium, as the marginal cost of hedging increases.

13:491:33316:17:16:71:539:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:model results, we calibrate the model using key moments of the data: in particular, the volatility
13:492:33414:16:16:71:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the commodity futures returns, commodity expenditure relative to aggregate endowment (GDP)
13:493:33507:16:17:71:539:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and aggregate endowment growth, as well as the mean and volatility of the equity market pricing
13:494:33602:17:16:71:378:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:kernel. The details of the calibration are given in the Appendix.
13:495:33667:16:17:88:539:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The severity of the model’s frictions are increasing in the variance aversion of producers and

13:500:34138:17:16:72:539:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and futures risk premiums are indeed increasing in producer and speculator risk aversion, while
13:501:34233:16:16:72:545:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:inventory is decreasing.  The calibration implies economically significantvariationinbothspot

13:505:34614:17:16:72:539:378:121:g_d0_f9:121:g_d0_f3:B:6%, whereas for low producer hedging demand and speculator risk aversion (Sharpe ratio of about

13:507:34803:17:16:72:540:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:than1%. At the same time, the impact on inventory is about a1%to9%change in the level. The
13:508:34893:16:16:72:540:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:effect on expected percentage spot price changes is about the same as for the futures, since the cost
13:509:34994:16:17:72:540:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of carry relation holds when there is no stock-out. In sum, reasonable levels of the costs of hedging
13:510:35095:17:16:72:539:296:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and required risk compensation leads to economically significant abnormal returns in the futures

13:512:35252:17:16:88:539:263:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Figure1also illustrates an intuitive interaction between speculator risk tolerance and producer
13:513:35347:16:17:72:539:247:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging demand. In particular, the response ofthe abnormal futures risk premium to changes in
13:514:35440:17:16:72:540:230:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producer hedging demand is smaller when speculator risk tolerance is high. These are times when
13:515:35535:16:16:72:540:214:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:speculators are willing to meet the hedging demand of producers with small price concessions. If,
13:516:35632:16:17:72:539:198:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:conversely, speculators are more risk averse, the price concession required to meet an additional
13:517:35729:17:38:72:224:181:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:unit of hedging demand is high.

13:519:35781:27:17:72:539:116:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In our empirical analysis we test the main predictions of the model, as laid out in Proposition1.
13:520:35878:17:0:71:540:99:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:To do so, we need proxies forand- the fundamental hedging demand and risk appetite of
14:521:35969:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producers and speculators, respectively. Clearly, from Equation (11), to identify time-variation in
14:522:36068:17:16:72:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the futures risk premium from hedging pressure and limits to speculative capital, we must control for
14:523:36169:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the covariance of the futures return with the equity pricing kernel. We therefore apply a substantial
14:524:36270:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:set of controls and robustness checks in the empirical analysis in order to establish that ourfindings
14:525:36372:16:32:72:433:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:arise on account of producer hedging demand and limited arbitrage capital.

14:532:36928:16:16:72:539:487:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:four commodities: crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas. The full sample of producers

14:544:37943:16:17:72:540:245:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:There are both empirical and theoretical motivations for this choice, which we discuss below. In
14:545:38039:17:16:72:539:228:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:addition, we show in the following section that the available micro-evidence of individual producer
14:546:38138:16:17:72:349:212:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging behavior in our sample supports this assumption.
14:547:38194:17:16:88:539:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The driver of hedging demand that we focus on is managerial aversion to distress and default.
14:548:38287:16:17:72:540:179:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, we postulate that managers act in an increasingly risk averse manner as the likelihood
14:549:38388:17:16:72:540:162:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of distress and default increases. Amihud and Lev (1981) and Stulz (1984) propose general aversion
14:550:38486:16:16:72:539:146:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of managers to variance of cashflows as a driver of hedging demand, the rationale being that while

15:558:39265:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:with higher leverage and deteriorating performance: e.g., Coughlan and Schmidt (1985), Warner
15:559:39358:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:et al. (1988) and Weisbach (1988) provide evidence that top management turnover is predicted
15:560:39450:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by declining stock market performance. Gilson (1989) refines this evidence, and examines the role
15:561:39547:16:16:72:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of defaults and leverage. Hefirstfinds that management turnover is more likely following poor
15:562:39640:16:17:72:539:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stock-market performance, and thatfirms that are highly leveraged or in default on their debt
15:563:39733:17:16:72:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:experience higher top management turnover than their counterparts. Gilson further documents
15:564:39824:16:17:72:539:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that following their resignation fromfirms in default, managers are not subsequently employed
15:565:39917:17:16:72:539:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by another exchange-listedfirm for at least three years - consistent with managers experiencing
15:566:40012:16:17:72:540:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:large personal costs when theirfirms default. Finally, Haushalter (2000, 2001) in a survey of one
15:567:40109:17:16:72:539:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hundred oil and gasfirms over the 1992 to 1994 period, uncovers that their propensity to hedge is
15:568:40206:16:17:72:540:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:highly correlated with theirfinancing policies as well as their level of assets in place. In particular,
15:569:40310:17:16:72:539:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hefinds that the oil and gas producers in his sample that use more debtfinancing also hedge a
15:570:40403:16:16:72:540:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:greater fraction of their production, and he interprets this result as evidence that companies hedge
15:571:40503:16:17:72:282:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to reduce the likelihood offinancial distress.
15:572:40549:17:16:88:540:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Given this theoretical and empirical motivation, we employ both balance-sheet and market-
15:573:40638:16:17:72:539:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:based measures of default risk as our empirical proxies for the cost of externalfinance. The balance-
15:574:40739:17:16:72:540:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sheet based measure we employ is the Zmijewski (1984) score. This measure is positively related
15:575:40834:16:17:72:540:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to default risk and is a variant of Altman’s (1968) Z-score, and the methodology employed to
15:576:40926:17:16:72:539:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:calculate the Zmijewski-score was developed by identifying thefirm-level balance-sheet variables
15:577:41022:16:16:72:540:329:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that help to “discriminate” whether afirm is likely to default or not. The market-based measures we

16:607:42108:17:16:72:540:578:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:estimate of the EDF, employing certain assumptions about the variable used as inputs into the
16:608:42201:16:17:72:540:562:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:formula above.  We use their estimates in our empirical analysis.12Of the set of 525firms, we
16:609:42294:17:16:72:263:545:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:have naive EDF estimates for 435firms.
16:610:42332:16:17:88:540:529:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In the next section, wefirst confirm Haushalter’s (2000, 2001) results in our sample offirms —
16:611:42426:17:16:72:540:512:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:i.e., that our default risk measures are indeed related to individual producerfirms’ hedging activity.
16:612:42528:16:17:72:540:496:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We then aggregate thesefirm-specific measures within each commodity sector to obtain aggregate
16:613:42622:17:16:72:539:479:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measures of fundamental producer hedging demand,which are used to test the pricing implications
16:614:42717:16:16:72:540:463:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the model. To arrive at these aggregate measures of producer’s hedging demand, we construct an

16:616:42907:17:16:72:539:430:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in each commodity sector. While our sample offirms goes back until 1974, the number offirms in

16:618:43098:17:16:72:540:397:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f7:B:more than 10firms underlying the aggregate hedging measure in any given quarter. Figures2

16:621:43381:16:16:72:540:348:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:For ease of comparison, the series have been normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. All

16:623:43574:17:16:72:540:315:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for all the measures). As expected, the aggregate Zmijewski-scores and Naive EDF’s are positively
16:624:43671:16:17:72:539:299:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:correlated, while the aggregate 3-year producer lagged stock return measure is negatively correlated

17:639:44957:16:17:71:539:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:EDGAR database to ascertain the extent and nature of individual commodity producer hedging

17:642:45097:23:17:72:540:553:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The EDGAR database has available quarterly or annual statements for 231 of the 525firms in the
17:643:45191:17:16:72:540:536:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sample. In part, the smaller EDGAR sample is due to the fact that derivative positions are only
17:644:45286:16:17:72:540:520:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:reported in accounting statements, in our sample, from 1998 onwards.14We determine whether
17:645:45376:17:16:71:540:503:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:or not eachfirm uses derivatives for hedging commodity price exposure by reading at least two

17:647:45564:16:17:71:539:471:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:172 that explicitly state that they use commodity derivatives, 20 that explicitly state that they do
17:648:45664:17:16:71:540:454:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:notuse commodity derivatives, and 39 that don’t mention any use of derivatives. Of the 172firms
17:649:45759:16:17:71:539:438:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that use commodity derivatives, Panel B shows that 146 explicitly state that they use derivatives
17:650:45856:17:16:71:540:421:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:onlyfor hedging purposes, while 16firms say they both hedge and speculate. For the remaining
17:651:45948:16:17:71:539:405:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:10firms, we cannot tell. In sum, 74% of the producers in the EDGAR sample state that they use
17:652:46041:17:16:71:540:388:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity derivatives, while a maximum of 26% of thefirms do not use commodity derivatives.
17:653:46132:16:16:71:459:372:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Of thefirms that use derivatives, 85% are, by their own admission, pure hedgers.

17:657:46488:17:16:71:539:306:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:respectively. Most options positions are not strong volatility bets. In particular, low-cost collars
17:658:46588:16:17:71:539:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that are long out-of-the-money put and short out-of-the-money calls are the most common option
17:659:46682:17:16:71:539:273:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:strategy for producers — a position that is very similar to a short futures position. Thus, derivative
17:660:46784:16:17:71:540:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging strategies that are linear, or close to linear, in the underlying are by far the most common.
17:661:46885:17:16:88:539:240:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We focus on short-term commodity futures - the most liquid derivative instruments in the
17:662:46973:16:16:71:539:224:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity markets - in our empirical analysis. However, a considerable fraction of the hedging

17:664:47179:15:7:71:187:193:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:data from gold miningfirms.
17:665:47206:7:15:80:539:186:36:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:14Since the introduction of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s 133 regulation (Accounting for Derivative
17:666:47314:15:11:71:539:171:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Instruments and Hedging Activities), effective forfiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000,firms are required
17:667:47425:11:11:71:540:160:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:to measure allfinancial assets and liabilities on company balance sheets at fair value. In particular, hedging and
17:668:47539:11:10:71:539:149:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:derivative activities are usually disclosed in two places. Risk exposures and the accounting policy relating to the use of
17:669:47661:10:11:71:539:139:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:derivatives are included in “Market Risk Information.” Any unusual impact on earnings resulting from accounting for
17:670:47776:11:11:71:539:128:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:derivatives should be explained in the “Results of Operations.” Additionally, a further discussion of risk management
17:671:47893:11:11:71:539:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:activity is provided in a footnote disclosure titled “Risk Management Activities & Derivative Financial Instruments.”
17:672:48010:11:0:71:448:106:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Somefirms, however, provided some information on derivative positions also before this date.
18:673:48104:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is done with swaps, which are provided by banks over-the-counter, and often are longer term. On
18:674:48199:17:16:72:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the one hand, this indicates that a significant proportion of producer’s hedging is done outside
18:675:48295:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the futures markets that we consider. On the other hand, banks in turn hedge their aggregate
18:676:48387:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:net exposure in the underlying futures market and in the most liquid contracts. For instance, it is
18:677:48486:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:common to hedge long-term exposure by rolling over short-term contracts (e.g., Metallgesellschaft).
18:678:48585:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:A similar argument can be made for the net commodity option imbalance held by banks in the
18:679:48675:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate. Therefore, producers’ aggregate net hedging pressure is likely to be reflected in trades
18:680:48774:16:32:72:285:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the underlying short-term futures market.

18:682:48867:24:16:72:540:520:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Information about hedging positions from accounting statements could potentially be used directly
18:683:48964:16:16:72:540:504:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to assess the impact of time-varying producer hedging demand on commodity returns. However,
18:684:49055:16:17:72:539:488:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:there are significant data limitations for such use. First, FAS 133 requires thefirms to report mark-
18:685:49156:17:16:72:539:471:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to-market values of derivative positions, which are not directly informative about underlying price
18:686:49255:16:17:72:539:455:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:exposure. There is no agreed upon reporting standard or requirement for providing information
18:687:49348:17:16:72:540:438:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:on effective price exposure for eachfirm’s derivative positions, which leads to either non-reporting,
18:688:49449:16:17:72:540:422:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:or very different reporting of such information.  For instance,firms sometimes report notional
18:689:49543:17:16:72:540:405:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:outstanding or number of barrels underlying a contract, but not the direction of the position or the
18:690:49643:16:16:72:540:389:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:actual derivative instruments and contracts used, the 5%-, 10%-, or 20%-delta with respect to the
18:691:49740:16:17:72:539:373:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:underlying, or Value-at-Risk measures (again sometimes without mention of direction of hedge).
18:692:49834:17:16:72:540:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We went throughallthe quarterly and annual reports available for thefirms with SIC codes 2910
18:693:49927:16:17:72:540:340:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and 2911 (50firms) in the EDGAR database to attempt to extract (a) whether thefirms were long
18:694:50020:17:16:72:540:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:or short the underlying, and (b) the extent of exposure in each quarter or year as measured by
18:695:50114:16:17:72:532:307:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sensitivity to price changes in the underlying commodity futures price (i.e., a measure of Delta).
18:696:50212:17:16:88:540:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:PanelDinTable1reports that of the 34firms with these SIC codes that we couldfind in
18:697:50295:16:17:71:539:274:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:EDGAR, only 19 (56%) gave information about the direction of the hedge (long or short the
18:698:50384:17:16:71:540:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:underlying). Of these, 80%, on average, of thefirm-date observations were short the underlying
18:699:50478:16:16:71:539:241:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity. Since commodity producers are naturally long the commodity, one would expect that
18:700:50570:16:17:71:540:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the producers’ derivative hedge positions are always short the underlying.  However, there are
18:701:50664:17:16:71:540:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:complicating factors. First, somefirms do take speculative positions. Second, there are cases where
18:702:50763:16:17:71:539:192:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging demand could manifest itself in long positions in the futures market. For instance, a pure
18:703:50861:17:16:71:540:175:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:refiner may have an incentive to go long crude oil futures to hedge its input costs, but short,
18:704:50956:16:17:71:539:159:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:say gasoline futures to hedge its production. This suggests that it might be fruitful to separate
18:705:51053:17:16:71:539:142:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producers and producer refiners (such as Marathon Oil) from pure refiners (such as Frontier Oil)
18:706:51149:16:16:72:318:126:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in the analysis, and we do so as a robustness check.
18:707:51201:16:17:88:540:110:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Of the 19firms that reported whether they were long or short in the futures markets, we could
18:708:51294:17:0:72:540:93:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:only extract a reliable, and relatively long, time-series of derivative position exposure to the under-
19:709:51399:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:lying commodity price for 4firms: Marathon Oil, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation,
19:710:51491:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and Frontier Oil Corporation. Consequently, the data is not rich enough to provide a measure
19:711:51583:16:17:71:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ofaggregateproducer hedging positions based on direct (self-reported) observations of producers’
19:712:51679:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures hedging demand, even for the relatively short period for which EDGAR data is available.
19:713:51774:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Nevertheless, we show the relationship between the time series of hedging behavior and default
19:714:51868:17:16:72:539:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk for the 4firms for which we were able to extract this information. This represents an interest-

19:716:52067:16:17:72:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Haushalter (2000, 2001)) of the cross-sectional relation between hedging behavior and default risk

19:719:52219:23:16:72:540:504:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:From the quarterly and annual reports of these fourfirms, we extract a measure of eachfirm’s
19:720:52311:16:17:72:540:488:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:$1 delta exposure to the price of crude oil (i.e., how does the value of the company’s derivative
19:721:52408:17:16:72:540:471:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:position change if the price of the underlying increases by $1). This measure of eachfirm’s hedging
19:722:52507:16:17:71:540:455:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:position is constructed from, for instance, value-at-risk numbers that are provided in the reports
19:723:52605:17:16:71:539:438:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by assuming log-normal price movements and using the historical mean and volatility from the
19:724:52697:16:17:71:540:422:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:respective commodity futures returns. In other cases,firms report delta’s based on 5%, 10% and
19:725:52791:17:16:71:539:405:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:20% moves in the underlying price, which are then used to construct the $1 delta number as a
19:726:52883:16:16:71:207:389:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:measure of hedging demand.
19:727:52909:16:17:88:540:373:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We next compare the time-series of each of thefirms’ commodity derivatives hedging demand
19:728:52998:17:16:71:539:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to eachfirm’s Zmijewski-score and 3-year lagged stock return throughout the EDGAR sample.
19:729:53087:16:17:71:539:340:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:There are too few observations perfirm to compare with the naive-EDF scores, which is only
19:730:53177:17:16:71:539:323:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:provided to us until the end of 2003. Figure3shows the negative of the imputed delta and the
19:731:53270:16:17:71:539:307:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Zmijewski-score for each of the four companies. Both variables are normalized to have mean zero
19:732:53365:17:16:71:540:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and unit variance. Thefigure shows that there is a strong, positive correlation between the level
19:733:53462:16:17:71:540:274:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of default risk, as measured by the Zmijewski-score and the amount of short exposure to crude oil
19:734:53559:17:16:71:539:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:using derivative positions for Marathon Oil, Hess Corp., and Valero Energy Corp. For Frontier Oil
19:735:53656:16:16:71:539:241:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Corp., the hedging activity is strongly negatively correlated with the Zmijewski-score. The same
19:736:53752:16:17:71:539:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:pattern can be seen in Figure3,whereeachfirm’s hedging activity is plotted against the negative
19:737:53848:17:16:71:540:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of its 3-year average stock returns. Marathon Oil and Hess both extract and refine oil and so it is
19:738:53947:16:17:71:540:192:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:natural that as default risk and hedging demand increases, thesefirms increase their short crude
19:739:54043:17:16:72:540:175:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:oil positions. Valero, however, is a pure refining company that one might argue should go more
19:740:54137:16:17:72:540:159:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f3:B:longcrude oil as default risk increases. This does not happen, however, because Valero in fact
19:741:54231:17:16:72:539:142:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:holds inventory of its input, crude oil, as well as for refined products. This was inferred by reading
19:742:54333:16:16:72:539:126:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Valero’s quarterly reports, and is anecdotally quite a common happenstance for refiners. Thus, an
19:743:54430:16:17:72:540:110:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the demand for hedging leads to increasing hedge of both the input and output good
19:744:54524:17:0:72:540:93:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:inventories. Frontier Oil, however, behaves more as one might naively expect of a refiner, as the
20:745:54623:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:company does not hold significant crude inventory in this sample, and decreases its short crude
20:746:54718:17:16:72:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:positions as default risk increases. Finally, as a check that the proxies used capture default risk in
20:747:54820:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:our sample, Figure3shows the time-series relation between Valero’s 5-year CDS spread (obtained
20:748:54915:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:from Markit) and its short crude oil hedging. Valero is the only of thesefirms where CDS data was
20:749:55012:16:17:72:460:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:available to us. Again, we see a strong relation between hedging and default risk.
20:750:55094:17:16:88:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, in these fourfirms, which constituted the best sample available in EDGAR of the
20:751:55181:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producerfirms, it is clear that hedging activity is time-varying, and related to the proposed proxies
20:752:55282:16:17:72:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for fundamental hedging demand. However, the graphs highlight that one must take care when
20:753:55372:17:16:72:539:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:inferring expected hedging activity from whether afirm is involved only with extraction, extraction
20:754:55471:16:17:72:540:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and refining, or purely refining. Essentially, allfirms are to some extent naturally long crude oil,
20:755:55571:17:16:72:543:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:but for pure refiners,thisislikelylesstruethanforcompaniesthatengageinbothextractionas
20:756:55657:16:17:72:396:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:well as refining - echoing the analysis in Ederington and Lee (2002).
20:757:55726:17:16:88:539:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We now turn to our analysis of theaggregaterelationships between our proxies for fundamental

20:762:56133:27:17:72:539:379:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we employ the aggregate measures of producer hedging demand, for which we

20:764:56318:16:32:72:192:346:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:documented in Section2.

20:766:56379:24:16:72:540:290:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Our commodity futures price data is for NYMEX contracts and is obtained from Datastream. The
20:767:56471:16:17:72:539:274:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:longest futures return sample period available in Datastream goes from thefirst quarter of 1980
20:768:56566:17:16:72:345:257:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:until the fourth quarter of 2006 (108 quarters; crude oil).
20:769:56625:16:17:88:539:241:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To create the basis and returns measures, we follow the methodology of Gorton, Hayashi and
20:770:56715:17:16:72:540:224:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Rouwenhorst (2007). We construct rolling commodity futures excess returns at the end of each
20:771:56807:16:17:72:539:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:month as the one-period price difference in the nearest to maturity contract that would not expire
20:772:56905:17:16:72:539:191:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:during the next month. That is, the excess return from the end of monthto the next is calculated
20:773:57002:16:9:72:85:175:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as:

20:779:57212:16:0:71:539:99:121:g_d0_f7:121:g_d0_f3:B:+1. The quarterly return is constructed as the product of the three monthly gross returns in the
21:780:57311:0:17:72:110:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:quarter.
21:781:57319:17:16:88:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The futures basis is calculated for each commodity as(12−1),where1is the nearest
21:782:57403:16:17:72:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures contract and2is the next nearest futures contract.  Summary statistics about these
21:783:57494:17:16:72:540:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:quarterly measures are presented in Table2. Note that the means and medians of the basis in the
21:784:57589:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:table are computed using the raw data, while the standard deviation andfirst-order autocorrelation
21:785:57687:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient are computed using the deseasonalized basis, where the deseasonalized basis is simply
21:786:57784:16:16:72:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the residual from a regression of the actual basis onfour quarterly dummies. The basis is persistent
21:787:57884:16:17:72:375:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:across all commodities once seasonality has been accounted for.
21:788:57947:17:16:88:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Table2further shows that the excess returns are on average positive for all three commodities,
21:789:58041:16:17:71:539:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:ranging from25%to67%, with relatively large standard deviations (overall in excess of20%). As
21:790:58136:17:16:72:540:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:expected, the sample autocorrelations of excess returns on the futures are close to zero. The spot
21:791:58234:16:17:72:540:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns are defined using the nearest-to-expiration futures contract, again consistent with Gorton,
21:792:58333:17:11:72:233:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Hayashi and Rouwenhorst (2007):

21:796:58390:27:17:72:540:448:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Again, the quarterly return is constructed by aggregating monthly returns as defined above. Note
21:797:58486:17:16:72:540:431:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that the spot returns display negative autocorrelation, consistent with mean-reversion in the level
21:798:58585:16:32:72:153:415:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the spot price.
21:799:58603:32:24:72:159:383:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:5.2  Inventory
21:800:58617:24:16:72:540:359:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:For all four energy commodities, aggregate U.S. inventories are obtained from the Department
21:801:58709:16:17:72:540:343:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of Energy’s Monthly Energy Review.  For Crude Oil, we use the item: “U.S. crude oil ending
21:802:58799:17:16:72:540:326:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stocks non-SPR, thousands of barrels.” For Heating Oil, we use the item: “U.S. total distillate
21:803:58894:16:17:72:540:310:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:stocks”. For Gasoline, we use: “U.S. total motorgasoline ending stocks, thousands of barrels.”
21:804:58988:17:16:72:540:293:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, for Natural Gas, we use: “U.S. totalnatural gas in underground storage (working gas),
21:805:59082:16:17:72:540:277:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:millions of cubic feet.” Following Gorton, Hayashi and Rouwenhorst (2007), we compute a measure
21:806:59177:17:16:72:540:260:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the discretionary level of aggregate inventory by subtracting a moving trend of inventory from
21:807:59274:16:16:72:540:244:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the quarterly realized inventory (so as to avoid look-ahead bias).  Quarterly trend inventory is
21:808:59370:16:17:72:540:228:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:created using a Hodrick-Prescottfilter with the recommended smoothing parameter (1600). In all
21:809:59464:17:16:71:540:211:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:specifications that employ inventories, we also include quarterly dummy variables, to control for
21:810:59561:16:17:71:539:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the strong seasonality present in inventories. Table2shows summary statistics of the resulting
21:811:59655:17:16:71:539:178:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate inventory measure, i.e., the cyclical component of inventory stocks, for the commodities.
21:812:59754:16:0:71:539:162:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Once the seasonality in inventories is accounted for, the trend deviations in inventory are persistent.

22:814:59886:24:16:72:540:667:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reports aggregate data on net “hedger”
22:815:59972:16:17:72:540:651:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:positions in a variety of commodity futures contracts. These data have been used in several papers
22:816:60070:17:16:72:539:634:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that arrive at differing conclusions about their usefulness.  For example, Gorton, Hayashi and
22:817:60164:16:17:71:540:618:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Rouwenhorst (2007)find that this measure of hedger demand does not significantly forecast forward
22:818:60261:17:16:71:540:601:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk premiums, while De Roon, Nijman and Veld (2000)find that they hold some forecasting power
22:819:60355:16:17:71:540:585:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for futures risk premia. The CFTC hedging classification has significant shortcomings; in particular,
22:820:60456:17:16:72:540:568:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:anyone that can reasonably argue that they have a cash position in the underlying can obtain a
22:821:60550:16:16:72:540:552:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedger classification.  This includes consumers of the commodity, and more prominently, banks
22:822:60643:16:17:72:539:536:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that have offsetting positions in the commodity (perhaps on account of holding a position in the
22:823:60739:17:16:71:543:519:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:swap market). The line between a hedge trade and a speculative trade, as definedbythismeasure,
22:824:60833:16:17:71:539:503:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:is therefore blurred. We note these issues with the measure as they may help explain why the
22:825:60925:17:16:71:540:486:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:forecasting power of hedging pressure for futures risk premia is debatable, while our measures of
22:826:61022:16:17:71:539:470:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:default risk do seem to explain futures risk premia. Nevertheless, we use the CFTC data as a check
22:827:61120:17:16:71:539:453:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:that our measures of producers’ hedging demand is in fact reflected in futures positions as noted
22:828:61217:16:16:71:138:437:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:by the CFTC.
22:829:61229:16:17:88:539:421:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:The Hedger Net Positions data are obtained from Pinnacle Inc., which sources data directly from
22:830:61324:17:16:71:540:404:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Classification into Hedgers, Speculators and

22:840:61970:16:17:71:539:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the hedger positions are on average positive, which means investors classified as “hedgers” are

22:842:62160:16:16:72:540:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:indicating that there are times when the CFTC classified “hedgers” are actually net long commodity
22:843:62258:16:33:72:155:209:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures contracts.
22:844:62276:33:23:72:217:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:5.4  Aggregate Controls
22:845:62299:23:17:72:540:153:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:In our empirical tests, we use controls to account for sources of risk premia that are not due to
22:846:62396:17:16:72:540:136:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging pressure. In a standard asset pricing setting, time-varying aggregate risk aversion and/or
22:847:62494:16:16:72:539:120:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate risk can give rise to time-variation in excess returns.  This is reflected in the pricing
22:848:62593:16:0:72:539:104:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:kernel,Λ, of equity-holders in the model. To capture this source of variation, therefore, we include
23:849:62695:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:business cycle variables that have been shown to forecast excess asset returns in previous research.
23:850:62795:17:16:88:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We include the Default Spread: the difference between the Baa and Aaa rated corporate bond
23:851:62885:16:17:71:539:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:yields, which proxies for aggregate default risk in the economy and has been shown to forecast
23:852:62979:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:excess returns on stocks and bonds (see, e.g., Fama and French (1989), and Jagannathan and Wang
23:853:63074:16:17:71:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:(1996)). Following Harrison and Yogo (2009), we also include the Term Spread, constructed as the
23:854:63170:17:16:71:539:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:difference between the yield on a 5-year zero-coupon T-bond and the yield on the 3-month T-bill. We
23:855:63269:16:16:71:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:do not include the aggregate dividend yield, as this variable has no forecasting power for commodity
23:856:63369:16:17:71:539:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns (results available on request). Finally, to account for time-varying expected commodity spot
23:857:63469:17:16:71:539:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:demand, we use a forecast of quarterly GDP growth, obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s survey
23:858:63563:16:33:71:196:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of professional forecasters.
23:859:63591:33:23:72:274:510:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:C:5.5  Commodity Specific Controls
23:860:63623:23:16:72:540:487:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We also include controls that are specific to each commodity. As emphasized in Gorton, Hayashi,
23:861:63718:16:17:71:539:471:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and Rouwenhorst (2008), the cyclical level of inventory is related to the conditional volatility of the
23:862:63821:17:16:71:539:454:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:commodity price, and as such, the volatility of spot and futures returns. The basis is related to (the
23:863:63923:16:17:71:539:438:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:probability) of an inventory stock-out, and so is expected to have predictive power mainly for the
23:864:64021:17:16:71:539:421:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:spot return. When there is ample inventory, however, the basis is not expected to be informative

24:902:67170:16:16:71:539:273:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:demand are associated with higher futures risk premia. To do so, we run a standard forecasting

24:910:67834:15:11:71:539:117:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:West (1987) method, which is robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of the error terms, and in all pooled
24:911:67949:11:11:71:539:106:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:regressions, we employ Rogers (1983, 1993) errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity, own and cross-autocorrelation
24:912:68067:11:0:71:365:95:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:and contemporaneous correlation across all commodities in each quarter.
25:913:68140:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:well as a pooled regression across all commodities. First, we note that in all cases, the regression
25:914:68240:17:16:72:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients have the predicted sign: an increase in default risk forecasts higher futures returns over
25:915:68343:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the next quarter. For ease of interpretation, the default risk measures are in all cases normalized
25:916:68442:17:16:72:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to have unit variance, and thus the regression coefficients give the expected futures return response
25:917:68543:16:17:72:540:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:to a one standard deviation change in the aggregate default risk measure. The average expected
25:918:68637:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:return response is highly economically significant at4%per quarter across the commodities. The
25:919:68731:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f9:B:standard deviation of quarterly futures returns of Crude Oil, Heating Oil, and Gasoline is20%
25:920:68824:16:17:72:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:per quarter, and so the implied quarterly2from the effect of the producer fundamental hedging
25:921:68918:17:16:71:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:demand alone is4%for these commodities.  This is high for a quarterly forecasting regression,
25:922:69011:16:17:71:419:543:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:considering the high persistence of thepredictive default risk variables.16
25:923:69086:17:16:88:539:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f9:A:The pooled regressions show that the effect of producer hedging demand is significant at the5%
25:924:69180:16:17:71:539:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:level or greater for all the default measures. In the individual regressions, the evidence is strongest
25:925:69283:17:16:71:539:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for Crude Oil, Heating Oil and Gasoline, and somewhat weaker for Natural Gas. However, the the
25:926:69377:16:17:71:540:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:latter has the shortest time-series (49and63quarters when using the naive EDF or the two other
25:927:69471:17:16:71:539:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:default risk measures, respectively), which potentially explains the lower significance. Furthermore,
25:928:69572:16:16:71:539:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Haushalter (2000, 2001) points out that hedging for Natural Gas producers in particular is less
25:929:69667:16:17:71:539:428:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:prevalent and more risky since there is substantial basis risk depending on the location of the
25:930:69762:17:16:71:540:411:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producer relative to the location at which the benchmark price is set.17This may also be responsible
25:931:69862:16:17:72:463:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:for the somewhat weaker results we see for this commodity throughout the paper.
25:932:69941:17:16:88:540:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:In sum, we conclude that there is strong evidence that commodity producers’ fundamental
25:933:70028:16:17:72:540:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedging demand is positively related to the expected return of commodity futures, consistent with
25:934:70125:17:31:72:447:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the model in Section2. Next, we report three robustness checks of our results.
25:935:70203:31:17:88:539:314:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f3:A:Volatility Interaction.From the expression for the futures risk premium in Equation (11),
25:936:70292:17:16:72:540:297:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the model implies an interaction between fundamental hedging demand () and the commodity
25:937:70382:16:17:71:540:281:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:futures return volatility. In particular, a changein fundamental hedging demand has a larger impact
25:938:70481:17:29:71:530:264:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:on the futures risk premium if volatility is high. We test this relation by running the regression:

26:950:71414:17:16:71:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:Further, the conditional volatility of futures returns is an indirect control for supply uncertainty

26:952:71613:17:16:71:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk. The estimate of the conditional variance we use is the realized average squared daily futures

26:954:71809:17:16:71:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as there are both seasonalities and trends in volatility over the sample. Table5shows the results
26:955:71906:16:16:71:539:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:of the above regression, where all the independent variables are normalized to have zero mean
26:956:71999:16:17:71:539:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and unit variance. Focusing on the pooled regression results in the rightmost column, we see that

26:963:72592:17:16:71:540:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tofindfirms that are solely refiners. As discussed in Section3, pure play refiners may hedge short

26:978:73917:16:17:72:540:157:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:sures based on producers that state they are hedgers, and contrast these measures with measures
26:979:74012:17:16:72:540:140:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:derived from producers that are stated non-hedgers. First, we use the CFTC measures to substan-
26:980:74107:16:16:72:540:124:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:tiate a split of the sample of producingfirms intofirms that state they hedge, versusfirms that
26:981:74202:16:0:72:539:108:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are self-stated non-hedgers. This split is then used as a robustness check for the futures return
27:982:74301:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:forecasting regressions. The goal is to substantiate that our results arise from fundamental hedging
27:983:74401:17:16:72:540:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:demand rather than from any omitted variable in our empirical model that simultaneously drives
27:984:74495:16:17:72:313:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:defaults and the commodity futures risk premium.
27:985:74543:17:16:88:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:We split the producers into two groups based on whether a producer is a stated hedger or
27:986:74631:16:17:72:539:625:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:non-hedger, according to the data we gathered in Section3on individualfirms’ disclosures about
27:987:74725:17:16:72:540:608:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:their hedging policies.  If our model is correct, the forecasting power of default risk for futures
27:988:74824:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk premia should ariseonlyfor thosefirms that engage in hedging. To implement the split, we
27:989:74917:16:17:72:543:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:must implicitly extrapolate the behavior of the samplefirmsbackwardsintime. Thisisbecause
27:990:75006:17:16:72:540:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the EDGAR data only contains information back to 1998. Panel A of Table II identifies 20firms
27:991:75099:16:17:72:539:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:as stated non-hedgers and 146firms as stated hedgers. We construct aggregate Zmijewski-scores,

27:993:75265:16:17:88:540:510:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:One concern that arises in this context is that hedgingfirms tend to be quite a bit larger than
27:994:75360:17:16:72:540:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the non-hedgers. In particular, the average market value of the hedgers is $3,035 million versus
27:995:75456:16:17:72:545:477:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:only $313 million for stated non-hedgers.  Furthermore, the sample of hedgingfirmsislarger,
27:996:75547:17:16:72:540:460:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which reduces the idiosyncratic noise in aggregate measures constructed for this group offirms. To
27:997:75645:16:16:72:540:444:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:facilitate comparisons that are not driven by these differences, we identify a matched sample of self-

27:1000:75938:16:17:72:540:395:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the standard deviation of the market values is also then comparable to that of the non-hedgers.
27:1001:76033:17:16:72:534:378:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:There are 59firms in this matched sample, and we run our tests also using this matched sample.
27:1002:76127:16:17:88:539:362:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To decrease the amount of noise in the proxy for fundamental hedging demand in these tests, we
27:1003:76221:17:16:72:540:345:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:here define a consolidated default risk variable as simply an equal weighted average of the Zmijewski-

27:1005:76425:16:17:72:540:313:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:have been normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. The resulting consolidated, aggregate

28:1047:80038:15:11:71:539:137:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:normally employed in the literature, namely, the CFTC reported classification of futures market participants into

28:1049:80269:11:11:71:540:115:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:based purely on the reported functions of commodityfirms such as producer, refiner, marketer or distributor (see
28:1050:80381:11:0:71:540:104:82:g_d0_f3:82:g_d0_f3:F:Ederington and Lee (2002) for evidence that such classifications are noisy measures offirms’ actual hedging activities).
29:1051:80503:0:17:72:539:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:returns are of a similar size. Unlike in the results for futures returns, however, the basis is highly
29:1052:80605:17:16:72:539:674:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:significant in the pooled regressions. This is also consistent with the model, which predicts that
29:1053:80703:16:32:72:510:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the basis will indeed be more informative about future spot prices than futures risk premia.

29:1060:81356:17:16:72:539:527:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:an increase in the spot price. This effect is due to the possibility for increased risk-sharing between

30:1092:84251:16:17:72:540:577:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:predicts an intuitive interaction between the severity of the speculator constraint and producers’
30:1093:84349:17:16:72:540:560:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:fundamental hedging demand. In particular, if speculators have ample capital, they are willing to
30:1094:84446:16:17:72:540:544:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cheaply take the opposite side of producers’ hedge-motivated futures demand, while if speculator
30:1095:84542:17:16:72:453:527:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:capital is scarce, the compensation required (the futures risk premium) is large.
30:1096:84623:16:16:88:539:511:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:To empirically evaluate this interaction, we check whether the component of the Crude Oil

30:1098:84814:17:16:72:539:478:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:asset growth. The proxy for the fundamental hedging demand used here is the consolidated default
30:1099:84910:16:17:72:539:462:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:risk measure, based on a weighted average of the three default risk measures. The proportion of
30:1100:85005:17:16:71:539:445:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the risk premium due to producer hedging demand is constructed using the same regressions as

30:1105:85475:16:16:72:540:363:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:we sum to an annual, overlapping quarterly series to avoid seasonalities and to better capture
30:1106:85569:16:17:72:540:347:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:the underlying lower frequency dynamics.  The asset growth measures are also summed to an

31:1131:87731:17:16:71:539:520:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:However, this effect is only statistically significant for the 3 year lagged return measure.  The

31:1139:88421:28:16:72:540:356:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:We build a theoretical model in which the interaction between commodity producers who are

31:1143:88791:16:17:72:540:291:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:producers - their default risk - and data from oil and gas markets, wefind evidence to support the
31:1144:88889:17:16:72:540:274:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:predictions of the model. Our main insight is that the hedging demand of producers is an important
31:1145:88987:16:17:72:540:258:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:channel through which trading in commodity futures markets can affect spot prices. This occurs in
31:1146:89084:17:16:72:540:241:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:our model because futures markets allow producers’ inventory holdings to better adjust to current
31:1147:89181:16:17:72:201:225:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:and future demand shocks.
31:1148:89206:17:16:88:539:208:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:A:Our model and results provide a useful lens through which to view an important debate about

31:1150:89392:16:17:72:540:176:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cious metals experienced price rises in excess of 100%. Over the same period, there was a huge
31:1151:89486:17:16:72:539:159:121:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the amount of capital committed to long positions in commodity futures contracts.22

32:1156:89904:0:17:72:540:691:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:While these trends occurred concurrently, some market practitioners and economists vehemently

32:1158:90093:16:17:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:relationship with commodity spot prices. Other commentators (most notably, Michael Masters, a
32:1159:90186:17:16:72:539:641:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:hedge-fund manager, and George Soros, who both testified to the US Congress) have blamed spec-

32:1162:90470:16:16:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:are fundamentally driven by physical demand, but thatfinancial speculation has played some role
32:1163:90565:16:17:72:540:576:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:in recent price rises. This last set of commentators has also argued thatfinancial speculation is in
32:1164:90665:17:16:72:539:559:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:fact stabilizing, for some of the reasons we outline in the model: the long positions taken byfinan-
32:1165:90765:16:17:72:540:543:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:cial investors have enabled producers to take short hedging positions and hold larger inventories,
32:1166:90863:17:16:72:439:526:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:which increases current spot prices and should stabilize prices going forward.

32:1168:91038:17:16:72:540:493:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:B:prices.  This is also consistent with the fallout of the sub-prime crisis in 2008, which increased

42:1777:112716:15:15:88:539:557:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:This analysis shows that the frictions assumed in this paper (limits to arbitrage and producer hedging demand) in general

42:1780:113080:15:15:72:539:512:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:main text, but also through the dynamics of the pricing kernel (Λ). However, the identifying component of the frictions lies in
42:1781:113207:15:15:72:539:497:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:the risk compensation of the second term in Equation (11), which is related to the magnitude of desired hedging and the total
42:1782:113332:15:15:71:335:482:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:volatility (including any idiosyncratic components) of the futures price.
42:1783:113405:15:15:88:539:467:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:Since changes in producer and speculator variance aversion coefficients affect the pricing kernel, and thus the risk-free

42:1786:113766:15:15:71:539:422:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:decreases in response to an increase in producer fundamental hedging demand. However, the implications for the futures risk
42:1787:113889:15:0:71:433:407:65:g_d0_f3:65:g_d0_f3:F:premium remained robust in these calibrations (results not reported, but available upon request).

52:2217:141575:14:14:76:532:651:127:Times:127:Times:C:dashed line corresponds to high speculator capital constraints (Js=40), while the solid line is the case 
52:2218:141680:14:13:76:500:637:127:Times:127:Times:C:of low speculator capital constraints ((Js=8)). The two top plots show the cost of hedging as a

52:2220:141873:13:13:76:529:611:127:Times:127:Times:C:speculators. The two middle plots show (on the left) the component of the futures risk premium due 
52:2221:141972:13:13:76:525:598:127:Times:127:Times:C:to the covariance with the equity market pricing kernel and (on the right) the component due to the 
52:2222:142072:13:13:76:524:585:127:Times:127:Times:C:combination of hedging pressure and limits to arbitrage. The two lowest graphs show the expected
