2:33:1856:17:21:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:India was a major player in the world export market for textiles in the early 18th century, but by the
2:34:1958:21:22:71:539:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:middle of the 19th century it had lost all of its export market and much of its domestic market. India
2:35:2060:22:21:71:539:549:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:underwent secular deindustrialization as a consequence. While India produced about 25 percent of
2:36:2156:21:24:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:world industrial output in 1750, this figure had fallen to only 2 percent by 1900. We ask how much
2:37:2254:24:26:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of India's deindustrialization was due to local supply-side forces -- such as political fragmentation
2:38:2355:26:25:71:539:478:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the 18th century and rising incidence of drought between the early 18th and 19th century, and how
2:39:2455:25:25:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:much to world price shocks. We use an open, three-sector neo-Ricardian model to organize our
2:40:2547:25:26:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thinking about the relative role played by domestic and foreign forces. A newly compiled database
2:41:2644:26:25:71:539:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of relative price evidence is central to our analysis. We document trends in the ratio of export to
2:42:2743:25:26:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:import prices (the external terms of trade) from 1800 to 1913, and that of tradable to non-tradable
2:43:2842:26:25:71:539:351:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:goods  and  own-wages  in  the  tradable  sectors  back  to  1765.  Whether  Indian  deindustrialization
2:44:2946:25:26:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:shocks and responses were big or small is then assessed by comparisons with other parts of the
2:45:3040:26:30:71:119:300:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:periphery.

3:57:3510:0:12:272:342:710:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4:1. Introduction 
3:58:3526:12:24:71:74:698:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4: 
3:59:3526:24:25:108:539:674:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The idea that India suffered deindustrialization during the 19th century has a long pedigree. The image 
3:60:3630:25:24:71:509:649:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of skilled weavers thrown back on the soil was a powerful metaphor for the economic stagnation Indian 
3:61:3732:24:24:71:528:625:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:nationalists believed was brought on by British rule. However, whether and why deindustrialization actually 
3:62:3840:24:24:71:529:601:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:happened in India remains open to debate. Quantitative evidence on the overall level of economic activity in 
3:63:3949:24:24:71:521:577:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:18th and 19th century India is scant, let alone evidence on its breakdown between agriculture, industry, and 
3:64:4058:24:24:71:541:553:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:services. Most deindustrialization assessments rely on very sparse data on employment and output shares. Data 
3:65:4168:24:24:71:538:529:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:on prices are much more plentiful, and, as a consequence, this paper uses newly compiled evidence on relative 
3:66:4278:24:25:71:539:505:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:prices to offer a new (price dual) assessment of deindustrialization in 18th and 19th century India. A simple neo-
3:67:4392:25:24:71:527:480:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Ricardian model of deindustrialization links relative prices to employment shares. We think the paper sheds 
3:68:4500:24:24:71:524:456:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:new light on whether and when deindustrialization happened, whether it was more or less dramatic in India 
3:69:4606:24:24:71:231:432:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:than elsewhere, and its likely causes.  
3:70:4646:24:24:107:539:408:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The existing literature primarily attributes India’s deindustrialization to Britain’s productivity gains in 
3:71:4754:24:24:71:509:384:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textile manufacture and to the world transport revolution. Improved British productivity, first in cottage 
3:72:4861:24:24:71:503:360:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:production and then in factory goods, led to declining world textile prices, making production in India 
3:73:4965:24:25:71:539:336:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:increasingly uneconomic (Roy 2002). These forces were reinforced by declining sea freight rates which served 
3:74:5074:25:24:71:528:311:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:to foster trade and specialization for both Britain and India. As a result, Britain first won over India’s export 
3:75:5188:24:24:71:535:287:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:market and eventually took over much of its domestic market as well. This explanation for deindustrialization 
3:76:5298:24:24:71:541:263:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:was a potent weapon in the Indian nationalists’ critique of colonial rule (see e.g. Dutt 1906/1960; Nehru 1947). 
3:77:5411:24:24:71:521:239:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Like the first, a second explanation for India’s deindustrialization also has its roots in globalization forces: 
3:78:5524:24:24:71:537:215:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India’s commodity export sector saw its terms of trade relative to textiles improve significantly in the late 18th 
3:79:5638:24:25:71:530:191:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:century and it drew workers away from textiles. The historical literature also suggests a third explanation for 
3:80:5750:25:24:71:541:166:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization coming from the supply side. We believe the economic malaise India suffered following the 
3:81:5860:24:24:71:514:142:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:dissolution of Mughal hegemony in the 18th century ultimately led to aggregate supply-side problems for 
3:82:5964:24:24:71:515:118:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Indian manufacturing, even if producers in some regions benefited from the new order. In addition, India 
3:83:6069:24:0:71:541:94:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:suffered a secular deterioration in climate conditions in the century or so following the early 1700s. We believe 
4:84:6427:0:24:72:538:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:these added to the slump in agricultural productivity, to the rise in grain prices, and thus to deindustrialization. 
4:85:6544:24:25:72:524:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We will argue that these explanations are complementary and that each makes a contribution to our overall 
4:86:6650:25:24:72:311:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:understanding of India’s deindustrialization experience.  
4:87:6708:24:24:108:470:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: Before proceeding to our argument and evidence, we first offer a precise definition of 
4:88:6795:24:24:72:536:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization and elaborate on its likely causes. We develop some initial intuition using a simple 2-good 
4:89:6907:24:24:72:537:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:3-factor framework. Suppose an economy produces two commodities: agricultural goods, which are exported, 
4:90:7012:24:24:72:517:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and manufactured goods, which are imported. Suppose it uses three factors of production: labor, which is 
4:91:7117:24:24:72:519:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:mobile between the two sectors; land, which is used only in agriculture; and capital, which is used only in 
4:92:7225:24:25:72:541:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:manufacturing. Suppose further that this economy is what trade economists call a “small country” that takes its 
4:93:7337:25:24:72:529:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:terms of trade as exogenous, dictated by world markets. Given these assumptions, deindustrialization can be 
4:94:7445:24:24:72:512:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:defined as the movement of labor out of manufacturing and into agriculture, either measured in absolute 
4:95:7549:24:24:72:513:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f5:numbers (what we call strong deindustrialization), or as a share of total employment (what we call weak 
4:96:7653:24:24:72:162:420:110:g_d0_f5:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization).  
4:97:7676:24:24:108:533:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:While deindustrialization is easy enough to define, an assessment of its short and long run impact on 
4:98:7778:24:24:71:540:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:living standards and GDP growth is more contentious and hinges on the root causes of deindustrialization. One 
4:99:7888:24:25:71:539:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:possibility is that a country deindustrializes because its comparative advantage in the agricultural export sector 
4:100:8003:25:24:71:521:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:has been strengthened by productivity advance on the land at home or by increasing openness in the world 
4:101:8108:24:24:71:532:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:economy, or both. Under this scenario, GDP increases in the short-run. If productivity advance on the land is 
4:102:8218:24:24:71:537:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the cause, nothing happens to the terms of trade unless the small country assumption is violated, in which case 
4:103:8330:24:24:71:502:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:they deteriorate. If increased openness is the cause, the country enjoys an unambiguous terms of trade 
4:104:8433:24:24:71:537:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:improvement as declining world trade barriers raise export prices and lower import prices in the home market. 
4:105:8543:24:24:72:510:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Whether real wages also increase depends on the direction of the terms of trade change and whether the 
4:106:8646:24:25:71:524:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural good dominates workers’ budgets. Whether GDP increases in the long run depends on whether 
4:107:8749:25:24:71:540:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:industry generates accumulation and productivity externalities that agriculture does not. If industrialization is a 
4:108:8865:24:24:71:535:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:carrier of growth—as most growth theories imply—then deindustrialization could lead to a growth slowdown 
4:109:8970:24:24:71:519:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and low-income equilibrium. The possibility that deindustrialization induced by increased openness in the 
4:110:9076:24:0:71:506:82:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:world economy could engender low growth over the long run provides one potential explanation of the 
5:111:9420:0:24:72:496:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:divergence in income between countries that characterized the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries 
5:112:9524:24:25:72:534:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(Maddison 2001), and accounts for the much of the power that deindustrialization has had in both the politics 
5:113:9634:25:24:72:285:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and the historiography of countries affected by it.  
5:114:9687:24:24:108:520:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:A second possibility is that a country deindustrializes due to deterioration in home manufacturing 
5:115:9786:24:24:72:520:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:productivity and/or competitiveness. In this case, and still retaining the small country assumption, nothing 
5:116:9895:24:24:72:512:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:happens to the terms of trade, but real wages and living standards will deteriorate, and so will GDP. The 
5:117:10001:24:24:72:531:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:economic impact of deindustrialization from this source is unambiguous, and similarly carries the possibility 
5:118:10111:24:24:72:197:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of a low-growth equilibrium. 
5:119:10140:24:25:108:541:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:In order to make this theoretical framework flexible enough to handle the causes of deindustrialization 
5:120:10244:25:24:71:539:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:we believe most important, we need to add a non-tradable grain sector. The three sectors considered in the rest 
5:121:10356:24:24:71:531:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of the paper are: agricultural commodity exports, which are tradable on world markets and include industrial 
5:122:10465:24:24:71:496:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:intermediates (such as raw cotton and jute) and high-value consumer goods (such as opium and tea); 
5:123:10564:24:24:71:530:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:manufacturing, which is dominated by textiles and metal products and is also tradable; and grains, which are 
5:124:10673:24:24:71:331:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:non-tradable and include rice, wheat and other food staples.1  
5:125:10736:24:24:107:514:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We will build up our account of India’s deindustrialization as follows. In Section 2 we present a 
5:126:10834:24:25:71:503:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:theoretical narrative of India’s deindustrialization experience, drawing on evidence from the historical 
5:127:10939:25:24:71:541:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:literature. Section 3 reviews existing attempts to measure India’s deindustrialization. We then present a simple, 
5:128:11053:24:24:71:540:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:neo-Ricardian, general equilibrium model of deindustrialization in Section 4 to formalize our predictions about 
5:129:11165:24:24:71:533:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:relative prices and their relationship to employment shares. Section 5 presents three price series – commodity 
5:130:11276:24:24:71:530:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural exports (pC), manufactured textiles (pT) and non-tradable grains (pG), three intrasectoral terms of 
5:131:11389:24:24:72:527:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:trade series – pC/pT, pC/pG and pT/pG, three wage series – the grain wage (w/pG), the own-wage in the import 
5:132:11498:24:24:71:539:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:competing sector (w/pT), and the own-wage in the export sector (w/pC), and the external terms of trade (pC/pT). 
5:133:11610:24:25:71:525:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We will then assess this evidence in relation to the theoretical narrative, and also compare the relative price 
5:134:11722:25:24:71:510:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:experience of India with its primary competitor during this period, England. Section 6 compares India’s 
5:135:11826:24:34:71:532:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrializing terms-of-trade shocks with those from other parts of the periphery, and section 7 concludes.

5:137:11990:7:15:72:527:89:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:1 Grains became tradable commodities throughout Asia in the late 19th century, but for the 18th and early 19th century, it 
5:138:12113:15:0:72:271:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:seems more accurate to treat them as non-tradables.

6:141:12463:25:24:108:537:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Our narrative account of India’s deindustrialization embraces the three contending deindustrialization 
6:142:12566:24:24:72:520:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:hypotheses, and traces the roots of deindustrialization well back into the 18th century. Two continent-wide 
6:143:12674:24:24:72:535:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:political changes ground our understanding of India’s 18th century: The dissolution of the Mughal empire into 
6:144:12784:24:24:72:517:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:a constellation of small successor states followed after a time by the initial phase of reintegration of these 
6:145:12895:24:24:72:533:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:states under the East India Company. Historians have long thought that India underwent an overall economic 
6:146:13002:24:24:72:516:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:decline during the 18th century, following the collapse of Mughal authority. This proposition has recently 
6:147:13109:24:25:71:500:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:become controversial, and we will stake out our position in favor of it below. We believe the political 
6:148:13213:25:24:71:523:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:fragmentation of the 18th century engendered a decline in agricultural productivity that was reinforced by a 
6:149:13322:24:24:72:510:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:devastating climatic shift, a steep upward trend in the frequency of droughts.2 We start with the Mughal 
6:150:13427:24:24:71:326:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:collapse hypothesis, and then turn to the climate hypothesis. 
6:151:13489:24:24:71:74:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: 
6:152:13489:24:24:71:230:396:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4:The Mughal Collapse Hypothesis    
6:153:13523:24:24:108:527:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The dissolution of Mughal hegemony could have affected manufacturing through several channels. 
6:154:13618:24:25:71:507:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The first is a reduction in overall agricultural productivity through an increased rent burden, shifting of 
6:155:13726:25:24:71:507:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:settlement owing to insecurity, and warfare. Reduced agricultural productivity would be reflected in an 
6:156:13830:24:24:71:518:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:increase of the price of grain, the key non-tradable, and therefore in the relative price of non-tradeables to 
6:157:13941:24:24:71:537:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:tradables (such as textiles).3 To the extent that grain was the dominant consumption good for workers and that 
6:158:14052:24:24:72:534:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the grain wage was close to subsistence, this negative productivity shock should have put upward pressure on 
6:159:14161:24:24:72:529:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the nominal wage in cotton spinning and weaving. Cotton textile wages started from a low nominal but high 
6:160:14267:24:24:72:541:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:real base in the mid-18th century (Parthasarathi 1998; Allen 2001). Competitiveness in textile manufacturing is 
6:161:14379:24:25:72:519:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:negatively related to the own real wage w/pT, the nominal wage divided by the price of textiles. Declining 
6:162:14486:25:24:71:527:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textile prices and rising nominal wages put downward pressure on “profits” from both below and above. An

6:164:14644:7:15:72:541:123:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:2 Some have argued that deteriorating weather conditions helped precipitate the collapse of the Mughal Empire (Grove and 
6:165:14765:15:7:71:363:108:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:Chappell 2000: 15), but the alleged connection is not central to our analysis. 
6:166:14844:7:15:72:538:101:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:3 We assume that India was a price taker for textiles and other manufactures. Given this assumption, domestic demand did 
6:167:14965:15:0:72:540:86:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:not matter in determining the performance of Indian industry. Only price and competitiveness on the supply side mattered. 
7:168:15331:0:24:72:537:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:increase in the own wage in textiles would have hurt the edge India had relative to its 18th century competitors 
7:169:15444:24:25:72:539:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:in third-country export markets, such as the booming Atlantic economy.4 A decline in 18th century agricultural 
7:170:15555:25:24:71:532:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:productivity in India would suggest that even before factory-driven technologies appeared between 1780 and 
7:171:15662:24:24:71:541:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1820, Britain was already beginning to wrest away from India its dominant grip on the world export market for 
7:172:15772:24:24:71:113:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textiles.5  
7:173:15784:24:24:108:535:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We are not the first to exploit the connection between labor productivity in pre-industrial agriculture, 
7:174:15889:24:24:71:508:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:nominal wages in manufacturing, and the resulting competitiveness in world markets for manufactures. 
7:175:15990:24:24:71:536:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Alexander Gerschenkron (1962) and W. Arthur Lewis (1978: chp. 2) both used the argument to good effect in 
7:176:16096:24:25:71:523:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:explaining why low productivity in agriculture helps explain the absence or delay of industrial revolutions. 
7:177:16205:25:24:71:528:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:More recently, Prasannan Parthasarathi (1998) has argued that while low nominal wages in pre-colonial and 
7:178:16311:24:24:71:525:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:early colonial India gave it the edge in world textile markets, living standards for labor in the south of India 
7:179:16424:24:24:71:535:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:were just as high as that in the south of England. Indian productivity was higher in food grain production, and 
7:180:16536:24:24:71:220:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:thus food grain prices were lower.  
7:181:16572:24:24:108:535:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Historians have traditionally viewed India’s 18th century as a dark era of warfare, political chaos, and 
7:182:16677:24:24:71:531:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:economic decline sandwiched between stable and prosperous Mughal and British hegemonies. This view has 
7:183:16780:24:25:71:514:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:been vigorously challenged by the most recent generation of Indian historians, who have emphasized the 
7:184:16883:25:24:71:532:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:continuities between the earlier Mughal and later British states and the constellation of small successor states 
7:185:16996:24:24:71:530:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:that emerged with the ebbing of Mughal power (e.g. Alam 1986; Bayly 1983; Marshall 1987). The largest of 
7:186:17101:24:24:71:530:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:these successor states were the former Mughal provinces of Bengal, Awadh, Benaras, and Hyderabad. There 
7:187:17205:24:25:71:526:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:were many smaller ones as well. Their rulers were former provincial governors, Mughal officials, and other 
7:188:17312:25:11:539:542:226:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                                           
7:189:17482:11:11:72:517:215:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:Thus, we ignore as irrelevant any argument which appeals to a rise in the demand for cloth as per capita income rose 
7:190:17599:11:11:72:75:204:90:g_d0_f3:36:g_d0_f3:(Harnetty 1991: 455, 506; Morris 1983: 669).  4
7:191:17646:11:11:75:541:193:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3: English merchants and English ships were the main suppliers to the Atlantic trade, a lot of it the so-called re-export trade. 
7:192:17773:11:11:72:525:182:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:The share of Indian textiles in the West African trade was about 38 percent in the 1730s, 22 percent in the 1780s and 3 
7:193:17893:11:10:72:526:171:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:percent in the 1840s (Inikori 2002: 512-3 and 516). By the end of the 17th century, Indian calicos were a major force in 
7:194:18014:10:11:72:514:161:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:European markets (Landes 1998: 154). For example, the share of Indian textiles in total English trade with southern 
7:195:18130:11:11:72:539:150:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:Europe was more than 20 percent in the 1720s, but this share fell to about 6 percent in the 1780s and less than 4 percent in 
7:196:18255:11:11:72:531:139:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:the 1840s (Inikori 2002: 517). India was losing its world market share in textiles during the 18th century, long before the 
7:197:18379:11:7:71:153:128:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:industrial revolution. 
7:198:18402:7:15:72:526:121:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:5 To make matters worse, India, which had captured a good share of the English market in the 17th century, had -- as an 
7:199:18522:15:11:71:533:106:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:English defensive response -- already been legislated out of that market by Parliamentary decree between 1701 and 1722 
7:200:18641:11:0:71:532:95:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:(Inikori 2002: 431-2), thus protecting local textile producers. But Parliament kept the Atlantic economy as a competitive 
8:201:19007:0:24:72:513:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:men powerful enough to assert de facto sovereignty. They collected the land revenue, sometimes using a 
8:202:19110:24:25:72:532:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:modification of the old Mughal system, but submitted less and less of it to Delhi in favor of building up their 
8:203:19222:25:24:72:172:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:own armies and courts. 
8:204:19245:24:24:108:514:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:While it has been widely accepted that the successor states provided a greater degree of political 
8:205:19344:24:24:72:535:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:continuity and stability than was previously thought to have existed, no consensus has been reached about the 
8:206:19454:24:24:72:518:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:implications of this fact for overall course of the continental Indian economy in the 18th century. Marshall 
8:207:19563:24:24:72:534:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(2003) brings together contributions from the contending scholars and provides a useful overview. Where the 
8:208:19671:24:24:72:525:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:18th century economy is concerned, some see the literature on the successor states as a useful corrective but 
8:209:19781:24:25:72:541:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:believe the overall picture is one of decline. Others believe the traditional view to be fully overturned and view 
8:210:19896:25:24:72:542:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the 18th century as a period of continued growth, despite the ebbing of Mughal hegemony. Two key differences 
8:211:20005:24:24:71:520:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:between these views concern, first, the implications of the emergence of a new prosperity for the principal 
8:212:20113:24:24:71:502:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:towns and middle classes of the successor states, and second, the degree of centralization and stability 
8:213:20218:24:24:71:478:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:provided by the Mughal regime before its collapse, and thus the relative effect of the subsequent

8:215:20344:24:24:108:533:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We tend to agree with the position that sees an aggregate economic decline following the dissolution 
8:216:20445:24:25:71:517:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of a strong empire into contending states. We believe that the more optimistic narrative tends to place too 
8:217:20553:25:24:71:538:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:much emphasis on the prosperity of a few areas and groups, such as the towns of the successor states and their 
8:218:20664:24:24:71:527:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:middle classes, and too little emphasis on the evidence for decline in the rural areas and peripheries of these 
8:219:20776:24:24:71:541:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:states. Even in an era of aggregate economic decline, we would expect local booms to result from the diversion 
8:220:20887:24:24:71:512:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of land revenue flows from Delhi to the big towns of the successor states, where the new rulers and their 
8:221:20993:24:24:71:512:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:revenue farmers lived. Moreover, the rural, agricultural sector was overwhelmingly dominant in the 18th 
8:222:21096:24:25:71:540:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:century Indian economy,6 so it is the economic performance of that sector which will largely dictate the course 
8:223:21208:25:28:71:541:178:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of the overall economy, not what happens in the towns.7 The optimistic narrative also seems to overly discount 
8:224:21319:28:11:539:542:150:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                                           
8:225:21489:11:11:72:521:139:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:free trade zone. Of course, the large Indian Ocean market was also a free trade zone, and India had dominated this for 
8:226:21608:11:11:72:75:128:90:g_d0_f3:36:g_d0_f3:centuries (Chaudhuri 1978; Landes 1998: 154). 6
8:227:21655:11:11:75:75:117:90:g_d0_f3:36:g_d0_f3: Agriculture employed 68 percent of the Indian labor force even as late as 1901 (Roy 2002: 113). 7
8:228:21753:11:11:75:522:106:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3: Since we take grain to have been non-tradable internationally, any secular tendency for domestic demand to outpace 
8:229:21869:11:10:72:524:95:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:domestic supply would have raised grain prices. An exogenous acceleration of population growth would have lowered 
8:230:21983:10:11:72:512:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:labor productivity on the land, reduced food supply relative to demand, and thus raised the price of food. However, 
8:231:22099:11:0:72:526:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:population grew at only 0.26 percent per annum between 1700 and 1820, and this was only a trivial increase over what 
9:232:22460:0:24:72:540:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the strength of the Mughal empire and the economically favorable stability it brought. The Mughal state shows 
9:233:22570:24:25:72:538:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:evidence of having achieved a high level of centralization and control of revenue sources. Revenue realization 
9:234:22681:25:24:71:520:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:per cultivated acre was as high in remote provinces as in the center. Examination of the careers of Mughal 
9:235:22788:24:24:71:516:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:revenue officials shows that provincial postings were of virtually the same duration (about two and a half 
9:236:22895:24:24:71:532:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:years) all over the empire, suggesting that remote provinces were well integrated into the imperial machinery 
9:237:23005:24:24:71:528:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(Habib 2003). There do not appear to have been many Mughal officials who were in reality local potentates. 
9:238:23112:24:24:71:519:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:An imperial regime powerful enough to extract 40 percent of the economic surplus from distant provinces 
9:239:23216:24:24:71:501:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:must have also insured peace and security, which are in turn favorable for agricultural investment and 
9:240:23319:24:25:71:130:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:productivity.  
9:241:23334:25:24:108:525:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Our evidence for an overall 18th century economic decline begins with an examination of unskilled 
9:242:23432:24:24:71:493:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:wages in grain units, which are a good measure of the overall level of economic activity in a largely 
9:243:23534:24:24:71:522:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural economy. Figure 1 presents three grain-wage series, two from North India and one from South 
9:244:23639:24:24:71:537:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India, from Radhakamal Mukerjee (1939) and Stephen Broadberry and Bishnupriya Gupta (2005). This figure 
9:245:23743:24:24:71:531:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:documents a long-run decline in grain wages beginning in the last decades of the 17th century and continuing 
9:246:23852:24:24:71:539:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:until late in the 18th century.8 We believe it is important to realize that even though the wage and price data for 
9:247:23968:24:25:71:536:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:early modern India are thin, they provide us with one of the few indicators of the condition of ordinary people 
9:248:24080:25:24:71:508:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and the aggregate economy that is easily compared across time. We believe a number of features of the 
9:249:24182:24:24:71:510:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:transition of political authority from the Mughal empire to the successor states provide further evidence 
9:250:24288:24:24:71:541:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:supporting an overall economic decline, and moreover one that resulted from reduced agricultural productivity. 
9:251:24399:24:24:71:541:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:We find Christopher Bayly’s view of 18th century north India particularly compelling, as it is shows how urban 
9:252:24510:24:24:71:362:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:prosperity coexists with aggregate agricultural decline (Bayly 1983). 
9:253:24580:24:24:108:508:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:As central Mughal authority waned, the state resorted increasingly to revenue farming, and the 
9:254:24675:24:25:71:531:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:practice became even more widespread in the successor states. This served to raise the effective rent share to 
9:255:24786:25:35:71:518:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:50 percent or more, greater than the 40 percent maximum said to have been extracted by the Mughal state 
9:256:24890:35:11:539:542:119:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                                           
9:257:25060:11:11:72:521:108:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:preceded it (Moosvi 2000: 322). Thus, we believe other forces would have to explain any observed rise in the relative 
9:258:25178:11:12:71:131:97:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:price of grains. 
9:259:25195:12:11:72:75:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:

10:262:25548:24:25:72:522:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:to China’s 5 to 6 per cent, the Indian peasant had little incentive to invest labour or capital” (Raychaudhuri 
10:263:25659:25:24:72:512:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1983: 17). The economics is familiar to development economists, economic historians, and observers of 
10:264:25761:24:24:72:542:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:modern agrarian backwardness: The lower the share of output received by the peasant, the less incentive he has 
10:265:25872:24:24:72:522:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:to be productive, to carefully monitor the crop, to invest in land, and to remain in place rather than fleeing. 
10:266:25984:24:24:72:536:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Scattered evidence suggests that the rent burden may have been quite extreme in some locations (Bayly 1983: 
10:267:26092:24:24:72:524:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:42). In the Rohilla state north of Delhi, cultivators were stripped of their land rights entirely and reduced to 
10:268:26205:24:24:72:519:541:110:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:direct dependence. Under the savak system in north Awadh, cultivators received as little as one sixth of the 
10:269:26314:24:23:71:496:517:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:produce and their wives and children were required for corvée for a large part of the year. The Sayyids of 
10:270:26421:23:23:71:536:494:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Moradabad employed the batai system in which they “appropriated all 'save a bare subsistence' from the cultivators 
10:271:26536:23:23:71:536:471:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:and invaded the villages for several months a year with bullock teams, armed retainers, and weighmen to secure the 
10:272:26651:23:23:71:491:448:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:best portion of the crop.” Productivity must have suffered as a result of the increased rent burden. Tapan 
10:273:26758:23:25:71:508:425:100:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Raychauduri claims the grain prices “increased by 30 percent or more in the 1740s and 1750s” as a result 
10:274:26863:25:24:72:522:400:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(Raychaudhuri 1983: 6). There is no reason to believe that when the British became rulers of the successor 
10:275:26970:24:24:71:533:376:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:states the revenue burden declined. Initially at least, British revenue officials saw slack in the existing system 
10:276:27085:24:24:71:305:352:110:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:more often than not, and increased the revenue burden. 
10:277:27139:24:24:108:533:328:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Rulers of the successor states also engaged in territorial disputes, and it is possible the increased rent 
10:278:27246:24:24:71:510:304:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:burden reflected military expenses. These wars drew key resources out of agriculture and also led to the 
10:279:27351:24:24:71:168:280:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:destruction of capital:  
10:280:27376:24:23:108:508:256:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:“Endemic local warfare ... and the collapse of local aristocracies had effects which were inimical to 
10:281:27478:23:23:108:534:233:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:agricultural production ... Cultivation was driven back from the roads by the passage of marauding armies 
10:282:27584:23:23:108:446:210:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:who sometimes deliberately destroyed walls and irrigation tanks” (Bayly 1983: 70). 
10:283:27667:23:23:72:525:187:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Areas at the edges of successor states were particularly prone to agricultural decline, perhaps because these were 
10:284:27782:23:23:72:526:164:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:most affected by territorial disputes, both between states and between local strongmen, who in remote areas were 
10:285:27895:23:23:72:534:141:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:relatively free to plunder their neighbors. This led to population shifts as cultivators retreated to more secure areas. 
10:286:28016:23:0:72:525:118:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Bayly describes “large penumbras of agricultural decline, particularly in the northwest” (1983, 76). However, he 
11:287:28373:0:23:72:496:710:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:believes that increases in input prices were even more significant than the withdrawal of some areas from 
11:288:28479:23:23:72:120:687:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:cultivation:

11:291:28703:23:23:107:513:618:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:local decline in cultivated area. Draught animals determined the extent of cultivation even more than 
11:292:28805:23:23:107:515:595:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:human labor, and there is scattered evidence of a great dearth of animal power in north central India” 
11:293:28908:23:23:107:189:572:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:(Bayly 1983: 70-1). 
11:294:28928:23:24:72:541:549:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:A dearth of animal power would certainly have led to less efficient cultivation techniques and increased prices. 
11:295:29041:24:24:72:542:525:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Cultivators who relied on the bullocks owned by others would have been particularly vulnerable to fluctuations 
11:296:29152:24:25:72:521:501:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:in their availability due to warfare. To cite an example, when Ahmed Shah Durrani invaded India from the 
11:297:29257:25:24:72:517:476:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:northwest in 1759, bullock hire rates between Benares and Patna, a route nearly 600 km from the furthest 
11:298:29362:24:24:72:535:452:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:extent of the fighting, increased by 500 percent (Bayly 1983: 68). This suggests the agricultural economy was 
11:299:29472:24:24:72:498:428:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:operating on very inelastic regions of the supply and/or demand curves for these key inputs, which is 
11:300:29574:24:24:72:539:404:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:suggestive of a shortage. Political fragmentation and warfare also disrupted India’s major internal trade routes, 
11:301:29688:24:24:72:517:380:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and likely increased transport costs and insurance. Since most long distance transport was by bullock, the 
11:302:29795:24:25:72:540:356:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:scarcity of bullock power resulting from warfare would have increased transport costs. Irfan Habib (2003) also 
11:303:29906:25:23:72:469:331:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:presents fragmentary evidence that insurance rates may have gone up during the 18th century.  
11:304:30000:23:23:108:531:308:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:We therefore find credible Holwell’s claim that the dissolution of the Mughal empire led to “a scarcity of 
11:305:30107:23:23:72:532:285:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:grains in all parts, [and] the wages of labour [were] greatly enhanced,” even if other aspects of the traditional view 
11:306:30226:23:23:72:539:262:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:of 18th century India have been discredited (Holwell 1766-1767, cited in Raychaudhuri 1983: 6). This presumed rise 
11:307:30341:23:23:72:477:239:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:in nominal wages would have slowly eroded the long-standing source of Indian 17th and 18th century

11:309:30554:23:23:72:535:193:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:and declining agricultural productivity in India must have been at the heart of it. After 1800, Indian “textile exports 
11:310:30674:23:23:72:525:170:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:... could not withstand the competition of English factory-produced cottons in the world market” (Moosvi 2002:

12:319:31403:24:24:72:534:613:110:g_d0_f5:110:g_d0_f3:the Species: “Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical 
12:320:31513:24:24:72:512:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be the most effective of all checks” (1972: 72, italics added). 
12:321:31620:24:24:72:511:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Indeed, for some time now, climate historians have developed evidence documenting frequent and deep 
12:322:31720:24:24:72:533:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:droughts in South Asia over the late 18th and 19th century (e.g. Grove 1997; Grove, Damodaran and Sangwan 
12:323:31826:24:25:71:522:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1998; Grove and Chappell 2000) and modern Indian data clearly document the powerful role of rainfall on 
12:324:31930:25:24:71:213:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:grain yields (Kapuscinski 2000).  
12:325:31964:24:24:107:527:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Figure 2 presents a centered 50-year moving average of the occurrence of drought in India between 
12:326:32062:24:24:72:527:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1550 and 1900. It includes archive-based drought data reported in Richard Grove and John Chappell (2000: 
12:327:32167:24:24:72:511:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Table 1) and culled from various sources (Habib 1977; Dyson 1989; and 19th century publications). The 
12:328:32269:24:24:71:518:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:pattern is striking. The average is close to 0.35 for the period 1550-1640, or about one drought year every 
12:329:32377:24:24:71:542:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:three. It then falls precipitously over a fifteen-year span to about 0.17, or about one drought year every six. The 
12:330:32493:24:25:71:522:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:statistic remains at this favorable level for the seventy years from 1655-1725. It then falls to an even lower 
12:331:32604:25:24:71:530:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:level in 1735, 0.10, or one drought year every ten, before beginning a steep eighty year climb to over 0.40 in 
12:332:32715:24:24:71:274:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1813, or one drought year every two and a half. 
12:333:32763:24:24:108:500:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India thus experienced a historically low rate of drought during the period 1650-1735, which 
12:334:32856:24:24:71:526:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:corresponds to the Mughal Empire’s golden age under Shah Jahan and its overextension and collapse under 
12:335:32960:24:24:71:539:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Aurangzeb. Shah Jahan’s reign was the height of Mughal opulence, and he built the Taj Mahal at Agra and the 
12:336:33068:24:24:71:533:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Lal Quila at Delhi. Aurangzeb by contrast was austere, and loved conquest more than luxury (Wolpert 1989). 
12:337:33175:24:25:71:516:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The Mughals increased the territory under their control by about half during the reigns of Shah Jahan and 
12:338:33281:25:24:71:515:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Aurangzeb, moving deep into southern and western India. The Empire reached its territorial maximum at 
12:339:33383:24:24:71:537:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:around the end of the 17th century, when only the very southern tip of the subcontinent was excluded (O’Brien 
12:340:33493:24:24:71:521:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1999). The last decades of Aurangzeb’s life were spent trying to subdue the tenacious Marathas in western 
12:341:33599:24:0:71:537:82:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India, at great cost in both blood and treasure. During the fractious succession following Aurangzeb’s death in 
13:342:33953:0:24:72:523:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1707, the Marathas surged out of their Deccan strongholds, extending their control across almost a third of 
13:343:34061:24:25:72:535:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India by 1757. The low drought occurrence during these years must have augmented agricultural productivity 
13:344:34168:25:24:72:525:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and thus the resources available for the conquest of vast territories by the Mughals and the Marathas. These 
13:345:34277:24:24:72:506:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:unusually good climatic conditions soured in 1735, when India was politically fragmented and conflict 
13:346:34379:24:24:72:384:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:widespread, thus making an increasingly bad agricultural situation worse. 
13:347:34453:24:24:108:534:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:All of this evidence suggests that a worsening climate may have reinforced the impact of the Mughal 
13:348:34553:24:24:71:538:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Empire’s decline on agricultural productivity. The combined influence of drought and the disintegration of the 
13:349:34664:24:24:71:540:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Mughal Empire on diminishing grain yields in the second half of the 18th and early 19th century can be inferred 
13:350:34776:24:25:72:523:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:from various fragmentary sources. For example, the evidence documenting deserted villages in rural Tamil 
13:351:34881:25:24:72:533:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Nadu in southern India (Lardinois 1989: 34-43) reveal very high rates between 1795 and 1847, but they were 
13:352:34988:24:25:72:540:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:more than twice as high in 1795-1814 (21.4 percent) than 1816-1847 (10.1 percent). Indeed, the worst El NiΖo 
13:353:35097:25:25:71:266:443:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:episode in written history was probably 1791: 
13:354:35143:25:24:107:536:418:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:“Already devastated by a famine in 1780 the Circars of the Madras Presidency were again very badly

13:356:35342:24:24:107:513:370:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:[One observer] later reported that ‘owing to a failure of rain ... one half of the inhabitants in the

13:360:35724:24:25:71:536:274:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:This evidence certainly suggests low and falling agricultural productivity in the second half of the 18th and the 
13:361:35838:25:24:72:532:249:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:early 19th century, but we think that the best evidence of poor agricultural conditions in India was the soaring

13:365:36089:24:24:108:510:153:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Even if we had good data on Indian employment and output in the 18th and early 19th centuries, 
13:366:36184:24:24:72:521:129:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization effects could be difficult to discern between 1772 and 1815, because during that period 
13:367:36292:24:25:72:541:105:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:there was a huge net financial transfer from India to Britain that was matched by a net transfer of Indian goods. 
13:368:36406:25:0:72:531:80:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The “drain resulting from contact with the West was the excess of exports from India for which there was no

14:372:37073:24:24:72:515:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:accumulated in India to England, increasing demand for them. Javier Cuenca Esteban estimates these net 
14:373:37176:24:24:72:535:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:financial transfers from India to Britain reached a peak of £1,014,000 annually in 1784-1792 before declining 
14:374:37286:24:24:72:529:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:to £477,000 in 1808-1815 and -£77,000 in 1816-1820 (Cuenca Esteban 2001: Table 1, line 20). However, at 
14:375:37390:24:24:72:524:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:their peak in 1784-1792, these net Indian transfers still amounted to less than 2 percent of British industrial 
14:376:37502:24:24:72:517:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:output (Deane and Cole 1967: Table 37, 166, using 1801 “manufacture, mining, building”). As a share of 
14:377:37605:24:25:72:523:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Indian industrial output, these net transfers were probably about the same.9 Thus, while a secular fall in the 
14:378:37716:25:24:71:522:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:“drain” after the 1784-1792 peak must have served to speed up the pace of deindustrialization in early 19th

14:380:37934:24:24:71:288:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:other fundamentals at work that mattered far more.

14:385:38230:25:24:72:512:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Globalization is the most popular explanation for India’s deindustrialization in the literature, and it is an 
14:386:38340:24:24:72:506:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:important component of the historiography of colonial India constructed by the Indian nationalists. For 
14:387:38444:24:24:72:506:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:example, Jawaharlal Nehru’s classic Discovery of India (1947) argued that India became progressively 
14:388:38545:24:24:72:533:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:ruralized in the 19th century owing to the destruction of artisanal employment by British factory-made goods. 
14:389:38655:24:24:72:532:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Nehru laid the blame squarely on colonial economic policy, which almost entirely eschewed tariff protection 
14:390:38763:24:24:72:532:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and did nothing to help nurture Indian industry (Nehru 1947: 247-53). Similar arguments can be found in the 
14:391:38871:24:25:72:541:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:work of the 19th century nationalist Dadabhai Naoroji, pioneering Indian economic historian R.C. Dutt, and the

14:395:39182:15:11:71:538:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:Pakistan) was about three times that of the United Kingdom, but the industrial share must have been a lot smaller in India.

15:399:39828:25:24:71:533:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:products and other manufactures in world markets. The European industrial leaders shared those productivity 
15:400:39936:24:24:71:527:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:gains with the rest of the world as augmented world supplies of manufactures lowered world prices. Having

15:406:40586:25:24:71:509:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and 1841-1850 (Mitchell and Deane 1962: 331). That is, the price of British exports (manufactures) fell 
15:407:40690:24:24:71:521:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:dramatically compared with that of its imports (industrial intermediates, food and other primary products).

15:409:40905:24:24:71:533:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:shock on that score alone. Failing to keep up with the factory-based productivity growth achieved abroad, the 
15:410:41015:24:24:71:540:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Indian textile industry took the price hit, became less profitable, and deindustrialization ensued. As if this were 
15:411:41131:24:24:72:535:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:not enough, the foreign-productivity-induced negative price shock was reinforced by another powerful global 
15:412:41239:24:25:72:502:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:event. Trade barriers between India and her foreign markets declined, particularly due to the transport 
15:413:41343:25:24:71:532:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:revolution (Shah Mohammed and Williamson 2004) but also due to tariff policy. The relative supply price of 
15:414:41450:24:24:71:535:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:manufactures in India was driven down still further, and it was driven down even more compared with Indian 
15:415:41557:24:24:71:535:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:exports, since overseas transport improvements served to raise export prices in the home market. These world 
15:416:41666:24:24:71:516:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:market integration trends served to create “Dutch disease” effects in India: The import-competing sectors 
15:417:41772:24:24:71:396:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:slumped, the export sectors boomed, and deindustrialization was reinforced.  
15:418:41849:24:24:107:533:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The decline in world textile prices caused by British productivity advance made textile production in 
15:419:41951:24:25:71:531:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India less attractive relative to Britain. It also contributed to a shift in the terms of trade between India’s own 
15:420:42067:25:24:71:522:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textiles and agricultural commodity export sectors, a shift reinforced by booming world demand for Indian 
15:421:42173:24:24:71:534:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural commodities. This shift alone would have caused a decline in the relative employment in textiles. 
15:422:42284:24:24:71:521:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The most important agricultural commodities for India in the first half of the 19th century were opium, raw 
15:423:42392:24:0:72:531:82:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:cotton, raw silk, and sugar, and they were a growing fraction of India’s exports. By 1811, they accounted for 
16:424:42744:0:24:72:530:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:57 percent of India’s exports by value, compared to 33 percent for cotton piecegoods (Chaudhuri 1983). The 
16:425:42851:24:25:72:541:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:role played by the terms of trade in reallocating resources to commodity agriculture is noted in the literature on 
16:426:42966:25:24:72:539:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the commercialization of Bengali agriculture in the late 18th century (Chowdhury 1964), but it has not yet been 
16:427:43078:24:24:72:241:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:a part of the deindustrialization debate.  
16:428:43121:24:24:108:539:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:In sum, our view is that the long run sources of India’s deindustrialization were both the globalization 
16:429:43226:24:24:72:530:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:price shocks due to European productivity advance in manufacturing (and the induced demand for industrial 
16:430:43332:24:24:72:540:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:intermediates such as cotton and indigo) plus the negative productivity shocks to Indian agriculture induced by 
16:431:43444:24:24:72:527:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the earlier Mughal decline and deteriorating climate conditions.10 We do not see these foreign and domestic 
16:432:43552:24:25:71:517:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:effects as competing. They were both at work, and they reinforced each other, although each had its most 
16:433:43657:25:24:71:240:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:important influence in different epochs.

16:437:43781:24:24:108:533:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Despite its importance for Indian historiography, owing to the dearth of statistical sources there have 
16:438:43885:24:24:72:521:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:been only four attempts to directly measure India’s 19th century deindustrialization experience by trying to 
16:439:43994:24:25:72:476:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:construct employment shares. We believe we are the first to apply relative price evidence to the 
16:440:44091:25:24:72:515:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization question, and by doing so the first to offer evidence, tentative though it may be, about 
16:441:44200:24:24:72:511:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization in the 18th and early 19th century. Tirthankar Roy (2000) offers a useful survey of the 
16:442:44308:24:24:72:533:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:existing direct evidence, starting with this big fact: It seems likely that the share of the work force engaged in 
16:443:44423:24:24:72:536:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:industry was quite a bit higher in 1800 (probably 15-18 percent) than it was in 1900 (about 10 percent). In the 
16:444:44535:24:24:72:499:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:strictest sense, therefore, strong deindustrialization appears to have taken place over the 19th century. 
16:445:44641:24:24:72:532:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:However, the literature insists on some qualifications to this big deindustrialization fact. First, many workers 
16:446:44754:24:25:72:520:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:who gave up industry over the century were working only part-time. Second, the import of machine-made 
16:447:44856:25:47:72:502:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:goods only helps explain the demise of textiles. Finally, cheaper imported cloth would have benefited 
16:448:44958:47:7:216:219:107:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
16:449:45011:7:15:72:538:100:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:10 Peter Harnetty would appear to agree, although he was speaking of the Central Provinces in the 1860s, after our century 
16:450:45134:15:11:72:529:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:of interest starting roughly with 1750. Harnetty says (1991: 460): “The combination of high food prices and cheap cloth 
16:451:45254:11:0:72:280:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:imports had a depressing effect on the local industry.” 
17:452:45552:0:24:72:527:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:consumers. All of these qualifications make good sense.11 In addition, the literature stresses that there was a 
17:453:45664:24:25:72:536:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:rise in employment in indigo, opium, and saltpeter, but these became major commodity exports, not industrial 
17:454:45773:25:24:71:101:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:goods. 
17:455:45780:24:24:107:531:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: The first evidence supporting strong deindustrialization was offered more than a half century ago by 
17:456:45881:24:24:71:532:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Colin Clark (1950). Clark published tabulations of the 1881 and 1911 Census of India showing that the share 
17:457:45989:24:24:71:528:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of the Indian workforce in manufacturing, mining, and construction declined from 28.4 to 12.4 percent from 
17:458:46096:24:24:71:502:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1881 to 1911, implying dramatic deindustrialization in the late 19th century. Daniel Thorner (1962) re-
17:459:46199:24:24:71:525:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:examined the Census data and convincingly argued that the tabulations used by Clark were misleading. His 
17:460:46304:24:25:71:542:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:revised estimates show that the sectoral employment structure was stationary after 1901, with only a very small 
17:461:46416:25:24:71:528:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:decline in male non-agricultural employment between 1881 and 1901. Thorner used these revisions to make 
17:462:46520:24:24:71:526:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:two important points. First, if there was a major shift out of industry and into agriculture, it occurred before 
17:463:46633:24:24:71:515:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1881, not after. Indeed, Om Prakash (2005: 28) reports that Indian textile employment fell by 3.6 million 
17:464:46739:24:24:71:536:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:between 1850 and 1880. Second, if deindustrialization occurred after 1881, it was on a very modest scale, and 
17:465:46849:24:24:71:206:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:all of it took place before 1901. 
17:466:46883:24:24:108:521:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: The third attempt to measure deindustrialization looks to the early 19th century, closer to the years 
17:467:46985:24:25:72:519:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:which anecdotal evidence has always suggested were those of most dramatic deindustrialization.12 Amiya 
17:468:47088:25:24:72:527:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Bagchi (1976a, 1976b) examined evidence on handloom spinning and other traditional industry in Gangetic 
17:469:47192:24:24:72:520:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Bihar, an area of eastern India, collected between 1809 and 1813 by the East India Company surveyor Dr. 
17:470:47296:24:24:72:510:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Francis Buchanan Hamilton.13 Bagchi compared Hamilton’s data with the 1901 Census estimates of the 
17:471:47395:24:24:71:519:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:population dependent on industry for the same area. His findings are presented in Table 1. The population 
17:472:47501:24:32:72:518:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:dependent on industrial employment requires an estimate of family size, and Bagchi makes two estimates 
17:473:47604:32:7:216:219:195:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
17:474:47657:7:15:72:508:188:42:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:11 The literature also argues that cheaper imported yarn would have reduced the production costs facing handloom 
17:475:47769:15:11:71:524:173:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:weavers, thus making them more competitive. Since cheaper European factory-produced yarn would have lowered the 
17:476:47881:11:11:71:521:162:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:production costs not just for Indian handloom weavers but for weavers the world around, it is not clear how this made 
17:477:47999:11:7:71:281:151:90:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Indian weavers more competitive with imported cloth. 
17:478:48051:7:16:72:536:144:42:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:12 Among the most well known examples is the powerful image quoted by Karl Marx in Das Kapital: “The misery hardly 
17:479:48165:16:11:71:493:128:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:finds a parallel in the history of commerce. The bones of the cotton-weavers are bleaching the plains of India” 
17:480:48277:11:11:71:541:117:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:(1977[1867], vol. 1: 558). Marx attributed this quote to the Governor-General of India in 1834-1835, who was Sir William 
17:481:48398:11:11:71:541:106:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:Bentinck. However, Morris D. Morris has pointed out that the quoted words do not appear in Bentinck’s report of that year 
17:482:48520:11:10:71:78:95:90:g_d0_f3:36:g_d0_f3:or in his papers (Morris 1969: 165, n.152). The true source of this first report of deindustrialization remains a mystery. 13
17:483:48644:10:11:78:536:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3: Hamilton spent nearly $20 million (2005 US$) on the survey, and his information appears to be of high quality (Martin 
17:484:48763:11:0:72:99:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:1838). 
18:485:49012:0:24:72:516:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:using altenative assumptions. Under Assumption A, each spinner supports only him or herself, and under 
18:486:49115:24:25:72:506:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Assumption B, each spinner also supports one other person. Under both assumptions, non-spinners are 
18:487:49215:25:24:72:538:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:assumed to support the survey’s modal family size (five). He also removes commercial workers from the 1901 
18:488:49321:24:24:71:513:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:data to make them consistent with the 1809-13 data. Spinners in Gangetic Bihar were almost exclusively 
18:489:49424:24:24:71:531:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:women who spun in the afternoons (Dutt 1960: 232-5). Hamilton’s estimates show that women earned about 
18:490:49527:24:24:71:541:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Rs. 3.25 annually at spinning, while a male day laborer who worked 200 days would earn about Rs. 8 annually, 
18:491:49636:24:24:71:536:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:all of which suggests that Assumption B is more likely to be true. In either case, Bagchi’s evidence suggests a 
18:492:49748:24:24:71:524:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:substantial decline in the industrial employment share during the 19th century from more than 21 percent to 
18:493:49856:24:25:71:522:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:less than 9 percent. When the Bagchi and Thorner evidence is combined, it suggests that most 19th century 
18:494:49962:25:24:71:282:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization took place during its first half. 
18:495:50016:24:24:107:510:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:While the employment share in “other industrial” occupations fell over the century as well, it is 
18:496:50114:24:24:71:535:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:important to note that the largest component of deindustrialization was the decline of cotton spinning.14 Table 
18:497:50226:24:24:72:468:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:2 rearranges Bagchi’s original numbers, making the contribution of cotton spinning to overall 
18:498:50320:24:24:72:529:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization more transparent. Of the 12.7 percent of the population that depended on cotton weaving 
18:499:50428:24:24:72:538:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and spinning in 1809-1813, more than 80 percent depended on spinning. Since cotton spinning was performed 
18:500:50534:24:25:72:524:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:part-time by women at home using extremely simple technology, it may seem implausible to argue that the 
18:501:50638:25:24:72:541:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:demise of cotton spinning in the early 19th century destroyed India’s platform for modern industrialization. Yet 
18:502:50751:24:24:71:532:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:British economic historians assign the same importance to home-based cotton spinning: 17th and 18th century 
18:503:50859:24:24:72:508:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:“proto-industrial” cottage industries are said to have supplied the platform for the factory-based British 
18:504:50966:24:24:72:536:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:industrial revolution that followed in the late 18th century (Mokyr 1993: chps. 1-3). Furthermore, employment 
18:505:51076:24:24:72:482:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of women and children was central to the process then too (Mokyr 1993: chp. 1; De Vries 1994). 
18:506:51171:24:24:108:536:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Finally, in an unpublished study reported by Habib (1985), Amalendu Guha calculated the amount of 
18:507:51269:24:25:72:509:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:cotton yarn available for Indian handloom production by subtracting the quantity used in local machine 
18:508:51372:25:24:72:537:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:production from total local yarn production and imports. The result documents a huge decline in yarn used for 
18:509:51482:24:24:72:515:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:handloom production, from 419 million pounds in 1850, to 240 in 1870 and to 221 in 1900. This indirect 
18:510:51585:24:0:72:527:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:evidence suggests that the decline in hand spinning documented for Gangetic Bihar in the early 19th century 
19:511:51935:0:24:72:542:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:was widespread, that it was followed by a decline in hand weaving during the mid-century, and that the decline

19:513:52147:25:24:72:436:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Harnetty’s summary characterization of Indian handloom weaving in the 19th century: 
19:514:52231:24:24:108:536:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:“At the opening of the century, the handloom weavers had supplied all the textile requirements of the 
19:515:52333:24:24:108:510:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:country and had maintained a flourishing export trade, notably to Britain [e.g. re-exports]. This 
19:516:52431:24:24:108:533:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:reached its peak in value in 1800 and in volume in 1802, thereafter, imports of Indian piece goods to 
19:517:52533:24:24:108:516:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Britain declined sharply in face of competition from the growing British cotton industry.” “From 
19:518:52630:24:24:108:507:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:about 1840 ... British imports entered the [local] market in strength.” “At the turn of the [20th] 
19:519:52729:24:25:107:504:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:century, India was absorbing more than 40 per cent of total British cloth exports to the world” 
19:520:52825:25:24:107:201:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(Harnetty 1991: 472). 
19:521:52847:24:24:71:513:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:As we have argued, the trouble actually started over the half century before the 1800 peak with Britain’s 
19:522:52953:24:24:71:320:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:challenge to India’s dominant presence in foreign markets. 
19:523:53012:24:24:107:522:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Paul Bairoch (1982) used evidence similar to that reviewed above to assess deindustrialization not 
19:524:53111:24:24:71:524:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:only in India, but across the non-European periphery. Table 3 reports Bairoch’s survey. In 1750, China and 
19:525:53218:24:24:71:541:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India together accounted for 57 percent of world manufacturing output, while India itself accounted for about a 
19:526:53330:24:25:71:532:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:quarter. By 1800, India’s world share had already eroded to less than a fifth, by 1860 to less than a tenth, and 
19:527:53443:25:24:71:535:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:by 1880 to less than 3 percent. Bairoch’s investigation found that India’s share in world manufacturing output 
19:528:53554:24:24:71:531:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:declined precipitously in the half century 1750-1800, before factory-led industrialization took hold in Britain 
19:529:53666:24:24:71:536:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and consistent with our hypothesis that deindustrialization took place in the 18th century. Furthermore, India’s 
19:530:53779:24:24:72:536:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:experience was different than that of China or the rest of the periphery. Between 1750 and 1830 India’s world 
19:531:53889:24:24:72:528:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:manufacturing output share dropped by 6.9 percentage points from a base of 24.5 percent, much bigger than 
19:532:53995:24:24:72:521:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the fall elsewhere (China lost 3 percentage points, and the rest of the periphery lost 2.4 percentage points). 
19:533:54106:24:25:72:516:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Bairoch’s data suggest that during the century before 1830, well before European factories flooded world 
19:534:54211:25:24:72:532:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:markets with manufactures, India suffered much more pronounced deindustrialization than did the rest of the 
19:535:54319:24:24:72:539:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:periphery. This fact must be explained by domestic conditions in India, not shared by the rest of the periphery, 
19:536:54432:24:24:72:335:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:fully consistent with our agricultural productivity hypothesis.  
19:537:54497:24:7:539:542:82:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                                                                                                                                           
19:538:54667:7:0:72:460:75:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:14 The percent of industrial workers who were spinners fell from 82 to 15 between 1809-13 and 1901. 
20:539:55009:0:24:108:520:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:World output shares can also change due to different rates of output growth across countries. The 
20:540:55107:24:25:72:518:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:economic implications of faster growth abroad are much more benign than those of slow growth at home. 
20:541:55209:25:24:71:494:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Anticipating this criticism, Bairoch (1982: Tables 6 and 9) also documented that per capita levels of 
20:542:55311:24:24:71:530:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:industrialization in India fell from an index of 7 in 1750 to 3 in 1860 and 2 in 1913. In contrast, Britain’s per 
20:543:55425:24:24:71:414:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:capita industrialization index rose from 10 in 1750 to 64 in 1860 to 115 in 1913.

20:546:55543:24:24:108:524:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Models of deindustrialization such as that of Paul Krugman and Anthony Venables (1995) suggest 
20:547:55638:24:25:71:539:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:that it should be accompanied by a long run decline in real wages. The evidence for 18th and 19th century India 
20:548:55750:25:24:71:371:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:is not yet of high quality, but it does document a secular deterioration.  
20:549:55825:24:24:108:530:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Parthasarathi (1998) argues that real wages in mid-late 18th century South India were comparable to 
20:550:55925:24:24:72:532:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:those in the south of England, and thus that the rising living standard gap between the two was a late 18th and 
20:551:56037:24:24:71:518:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:early 19th century phenomenon. Robert Allen (2001) uses Mughal manuscript sources to compute the real 
20:552:56139:24:24:71:541:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:wage in 1595 Agra, then the capital of the Mughal Empire. He compares it to the real wage in 1961, based on a 
20:553:56249:24:24:71:524:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:common market basket of consumer goods. Allen’s evidence documents a fall in the real wage by about 23 
20:554:56352:24:25:71:528:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:percent over those 366 years, and if Parthasarathi is correct, most of that fall must have taken place after the 
20:555:56465:25:24:71:508:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:mid-late18th century. Anthropometric evidence on south Indian indentured workers suggests that living 
20:556:56567:24:24:72:533:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:standards stagnated during the last half of the 19th century (Brannan et al. 1994). But perhaps the most telling 
20:557:56680:24:24:71:528:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:evidence of real wage performance, and its timing, comes from Mukerjee (1939) and Broadberry and Gupta 
20:558:56783:24:24:72:520:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(2005), reproduced in Figure 1. Mukerjee reports 1600-1938 real wages in northern India of unskilled and 
20:559:56888:24:24:72:523:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:skilled labor (nominal wage rates deflated by grain prices) starting with the same 1595 benchmark used by 
20:560:56994:24:24:72:535:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Allen. Broadberry and Gupta offer grain wages for both north and south India, with the most resolution in the 
20:561:57104:24:25:72:522:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:17th and 18th centuries. According to this evidence, by 1789 real wages had fallen 30-44 percent from their 
20:562:57212:25:24:71:400:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1600 level. By 1875, real wages were at only 25-50 percent of the 1600 level. 
20:563:57290:24:24:107:518:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:This evidence suggests that the vast majority of the real wage and living standards fall took place 
20:564:57390:24:24:71:516:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:before 1850, or even before 1825, not after. Was deindustrialization responsible for the fall, and were the 
20:565:57497:24:0:71:518:82:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization forces more powerful before 1850, or even before 1807, than after? The sparse data on 
21:566:57845:0:24:72:517:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:employment and output shares suggests deindustrialization was an important force in the Indian economy 
21:567:57948:24:25:72:526:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:during the 19th century. This account can be supplemented and pushed back into the 18th century with much 
21:568:58054:25:24:72:525:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:richer relative price data, but before doing so we need to model the relationship between relative prices and

21:574:58321:24:25:72:536:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization, we develop a simple neo-Ricardian model that relies on the classic contribution of Ronald 
21:575:58432:25:24:72:524:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Jones (1971). Consider a perfectly competitive economy in which there are three sectors: textiles (T), grain 
21:576:58541:24:24:72:538:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(G), and agricultural commodity exports (C). Grain is not traded. Agricultural commodity exports include non-
21:577:58650:24:24:72:542:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:grain items such as opium, tea, indigo, jute, and raw cotton. Textiles and agricultural commodities are traded in 
21:578:58764:24:24:72:527:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the world market and sell for the world prices pT and pC, respectively. Labor (L) is mobile between all three 
21:579:58874:24:24:72:538:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:sectors, is the only factor of production, and costs nominal wage w per unit. We abstract from capital and land 
21:580:58986:24:24:72:378:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:for simplicity,15 but in any case we do not need them to make our point.  
21:581:59060:24:25:107:526:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:To create a link between agricultural productivity and wages in the textile sector, which we believe 
21:582:59161:25:24:71:527:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:was a key driver in India's loss of competitiveness in the 18th century world textile market, we follow Lewis 
21:583:59271:24:24:72:538:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(1954, 1978) in assuming that the real wage in grain units is constant. This reflects the Malthusian assumption 
21:584:59383:24:24:72:538:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:that in a poor country the supply of labor will be unlimited as long as the wage assures subsistence. Any lower 
21:585:59495:24:24:72:514:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:wage leaves laborers unable to sustain the physical capacity for work. The Lewis assumption implies the 
21:586:59599:24:24:72:531:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:possibility of unemployment, so L represents employment rather than the population, which we denote by P.

22:608:61330:25:24:72:532:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Growth in the own wage in either commodity agriculture or textiles leads to a decline in the absolute number 
22:609:61439:24:24:72:514:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f5:of workers employed there. Thus, strong deindustrialization results from an increase in the own wage in 
22:610:61543:24:24:72:539:275:110:g_d0_f5:110:g_d0_f3:textiles. The own wage in either sector could increase due to a decline in the world price for its output. It could 
22:611:61659:24:24:72:499:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:also increase if the price of grain rose, for example from a negative productivity shock in agricultural

23:645:63478:24:24:71:538:424:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Given that both commodity agriculture and textile sectors are small shares of total employment in late 18th and 
23:646:63590:24:24:72:526:400:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:early 19th century India, the ratio on the right-hand side is likely to be less than one.17 This implies that own 
23:647:63704:24:25:72:499:376:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:wage growth in agricultural commodity exports would have to be even higher to counteract the weak 
23:648:63802:25:24:72:530:351:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization effect of own wage growth in textiles. In short, we expect to see weak deindustrialization 
23:649:63913:24:24:72:538:327:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:whenever own wage growth in textiles is positive, unless own wage growth in agricultural commodity exports 
23:650:64020:24:24:72:529:303:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:is much greater. Own wage growth in agricultural commodity exports dampens the weak deindustrialization 
23:651:64124:24:24:72:542:279:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:effect because it reduces LC, which is in the denominator of our weak deindustrialization measure. As the share 
23:652:64236:24:24:71:516:255:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:of the labor force employed in agricultural commodities increases, the greater growth in the own wage in 
23:653:64341:24:24:71:465:231:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textiles needs to be to overcome growth of the own wage in agricultural commodities and for 
23:654:64433:24:25:71:535:207:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization to ensue. We can also rewrite condition (11) to relate nominal wage growth to the terms of 
23:655:64544:25:24:71:287:182:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:trade between textiles and commodity agriculture.

23:659:64770:15:11:71:516:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization to occur, own wage growth in textiles must be about 0.12 times greater than own wage growth in

24:676:65596:25:24:71:526:595:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f5:production in textiles over agricultural commodities. Thus, weak deindustrialization should have been most

24:686:66268:24:24:107:529:354:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: We divide the Indian deindustrialization experience over the century and a half between about 1750 
24:687:66367:24:24:71:515:330:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and 1913 into three distinct epochs. Our interpretation of the fundamentals explaining deindustrialization 
24:688:66474:24:24:71:459:306:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:within each of these epochs implies predictions regarding changes in Indian relative prices.  
24:689:66568:24:25:107:523:282:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The first epoch, approximately 1750-1810, was one during which India lost its significant share of 
24:690:66667:25:24:71:525:257:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:world textile markets to Britain. What was an important export sector in India at the beginning of the epoch 
24:691:66776:24:24:71:538:233:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:became an important import-competing sector at the end. While that result can be explained by increasing cost 
24:692:66886:24:24:71:534:209:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:competitiveness favoring Britain, superior factory technology was not yet the main force at work. Instead, we 
24:693:66996:24:24:71:540:185:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:believe that it was reduced agricultural productivity in India that mattered most in this epoch. Grain prices rose 
24:694:67111:24:24:71:532:161:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and thus—in a relatively stable real wage subsistence economy where grain was the key consumption good—
24:695:67214:24:0:71:517:137:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:pushed up nominal wages economy-wide. Hence, the own wage rose in both tradable sectors, textiles and 
25:696:67558:0:24:72:502:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:commodity production, damaging cost competitiveness there.18 Textiles would thus experience strong 
25:697:67657:24:25:71:525:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization. To the extent that the price of textiles relative to commodities fell, the effect of reduced 
25:698:67771:25:24:71:470:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural productivity would have fallen more heavily on textiles than commodities, a weak 
25:699:67865:24:24:71:181:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization effect. 
25:700:67893:24:24:107:530:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The second epoch, approximately 1810-1860, was one during which India lost much of its domestic 
25:701:67989:24:24:71:523:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textile market to Britain. This result can be explained by the combined influence of relatively rapid factory-
25:702:68099:24:24:71:538:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:based productivity advance in Britain and by increased world market integration, the latter driven by declining 
25:703:68211:24:24:71:526:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:transport costs between the two trading partners, and to a free trade commitment for India on the part of her 
25:704:68321:24:25:72:533:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:colonial rulers. The terms of trade moved to favor India and hurt her import competing manufacturing sector. 
25:705:68430:25:24:72:532:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The effects of the economic difficulties of the 18th century were pretty much over, and the induced decline in 
25:706:68541:24:24:71:232:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Indian grain productivity had ceased.  
25:707:68580:24:24:108:515:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:The third epoch, approximately 1860-1913, was one during which the rate of deindustrialization 
25:708:68675:24:24:71:516:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:slowed down and eventually reversed. Late in the epoch, India was “reindustrializing.” This result can be 
25:709:68781:24:24:71:526:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:explained by the subsidence in both the unbalanced productivity advance favoring European manufacturing 
25:710:68885:24:24:71:533:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and in the world transport revolution. The terms of trade no longer moved in India’s favor and thus no longer 
25:711:68995:24:25:71:299:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:served to penalize import competing manufacturing.   
25:712:69048:25:24:108:536:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: These predictions are largely confirmed by our new relative price and terms-of-trade evidence, which 
25:713:69149:24:24:71:528:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:we plot in Figures 3-7. A full description of how we constructed the data can be found in the Appendix. The 
25:714:69257:24:24:71:505:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:analysis which follows will focus on the first two epochs, when deindustrialization was most dramatic. 
25:715:69360:24:24:108:522:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: Let us first consider strong deindustrialization across the first two epochs combined, recalling that 
25:716:69462:24:24:71:535:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:strong deindustrialization is defined as an absolute decline in the industrial workforce, driven in our model by 
25:717:69575:24:24:71:533:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the own wage. Figure 3 documents that between 1765 and 1810 the price of textiles relative to grains fell at a 
25:718:69686:24:25:71:535:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:spectacular rate: by 1805-1810, it was less than 20 percent of its 1765-1770 level. The decline continued after 
25:719:69798:25:24:71:538:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1810, but at a much slower rate. Why the spectacular fall in pT/pG in the late 18th century, especially compared 
25:720:69911:24:34:71:532:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:with the early 19th century? The answer is that grain prices, while volatile in the short run, soared upwards in 
25:721:70024:34:7:216:219:96:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
25:722:70077:7:15:72:527:89:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:18 If this formal “cost competitiveness” and “own-wage” language seems awkward when applied to household spinners 
25:723:70191:15:0:71:468:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:and weavers, think instead of the grain that could be bought with nominal earnings in those households. 
26:724:70537:0:24:72:537:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the long run. However, this did not serve to reduce real wages (w/pG). Figure 1 shows that grain wages appear 
26:725:70647:24:25:72:528:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:to have been largely stable following the early-mid 18th century.19 Figure 4 presents the grain wage using an 
26:726:70757:25:24:71:541:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:alternative series of grain prices and confirms this claim for roughly the same years, between the 1720s and the 
26:727:70870:24:24:71:357:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:1810s. Nominal wages were thus driven up along with grain prices. 
26:728:70936:24:24:108:531:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:While there was great short-run volatility in the grain wage, a Lewis-like assumption about long run 
26:729:71037:24:24:72:483:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:real wage stability seems to be reasonable for the first epoch. As a result, the own-wage in Indian 
26:730:71137:24:24:72:512:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:manufacturing (Figure 5: w/pT) more than doubled between 1765 and 1810. Since there is no qualitative 
26:731:71239:24:24:72:525:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:evidence suggesting significant productivity advance in Indian textiles and other manufacturing production 
26:732:71346:24:25:72:498:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:during this epoch,20 we take this evidence as powerful support for the thesis that reduced agricultural 
26:733:71450:25:24:71:537:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:productivity attendant on the dissolution of Mughal hegemony and more frequent droughts can indeed explain 
26:734:71557:24:24:71:487:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:much of India’s pre-1810 deindustrialization and loss of world markets. India lost much of its cost 
26:735:71657:24:24:71:540:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:competitiveness as the own-wage in home manufacturing underwent that spectacular rise, and it was the rise in 
26:736:71767:24:24:71:531:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the price of non-tradable grains that pushed up the nominal wage to such high levels. Most of the secular rise 
26:737:71878:24:24:71:521:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:in grain prices stopped after around 1810, and the upward pressure on nominal wages began to ease. Thus, 
26:738:71983:24:24:71:468:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:conditions in the grain sector stabilized a bit in the second epoch, and the fall in pT dominated 
26:739:72081:24:25:72:534:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization conditions in Indian manufacturing. The relative price pT/pG fell (Figure 3), the own-wage 
26:740:72192:25:24:71:530:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:w/pT rose (Figure 5), and deindustrialization continued – but now driven mainly by exogenous world market 
26:741:72298:24:24:71:102:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:forces. 
26:742:72306:24:24:108:538:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Now let us consider weak deindustrialization across the first two epochs, recalling that it will be more 
26:743:72411:24:24:71:527:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:intense when the own-wage in textiles is growing faster and when the intersectoral terms of trade is shifting 
26:744:72521:24:24:71:539:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:most strongly in favor of agricultural commodities. Figure 5 shows w/pT doubling between 1770 and 1810 and 
26:745:72628:24:24:71:514:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:more than doubling between 1810 and 1850. Thus, own-wage growth was slightly stronger in the second 
26:746:72728:24:25:71:513:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:epoch. Conversely, the terms of trade shift appears to be strongest in the first epoch. Figure 8 documents 
26:747:72835:25:36:71:511:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India’s external terms of trade from 1800. It shows two big spikes in the second epoch, the first over the 
26:748:72942:36:7:216:219:118:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
26:749:72995:7:16:72:538:111:42:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:19 Note that Broadberry and Gupta’s north India grain wage series contains no data points between 1690 and 1874, so it is 
26:750:73116:16:10:71:78:95:90:g_d0_f3:36:g_d0_f3:impossible to discern trends within the 18th century from it. 20
26:751:73180:10:11:78:534:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3: In any case, since agriculture was so huge, it must have dominated nation-wide labor scarcity conditions, not just those 
26:752:73302:11:0:72:142:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:in manufacturing. 
27:753:73562:0:24:72:533:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:decade of the 1810s and the second over the decade of the 1850s. When the series is smoothed, the measured 
27:754:73669:24:25:72:536:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:trend in the terms of trade favoring India (and thus penalizing the import competing sector) is very modest. In 
27:755:73781:25:24:72:531:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:contrast, during the first epoch the intersectoral terms of trade between textiles and agricultural commodities 
27:756:73893:24:24:72:540:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:(Figure 3: pT/pC) underwent a very sharp decline. By 1810 it was only 20 percent of its 1780 level, causing lost 
27:757:74006:24:24:71:524:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:agricultural productivity to fall much more heavily on textiles than on agricultural commodities during that 
27:758:74115:24:24:71:542:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:period. Indeed, the own wage in agricultural commodities actually fell during this period (Figure 5: w/pC). This 
27:759:74228:24:24:71:508:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:pattern suggests that strong deindustrialization may well have been greater in the first epoch than in the 
27:760:74335:24:24:71:527:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:second. In the first epoch, labor left textiles due to labor’s demand for higher nominal wages and to a strong 
27:761:74446:24:25:71:541:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:shift in the terms of trade favoring agricultural commodity exports and disfavoring textiles, while in the second 
27:762:74560:25:24:71:316:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:epoch labor left mainly due to falling world textile prices. 
27:763:74621:24:24:108:510:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: If we take the own-wage in manufacturing as a critical indicator of cost competitiveness, and if 
27:764:74718:24:24:71:524:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:England was India’s main competitor in world markets, we can compare trends in the own-wage in textiles 
27:765:74822:24:24:71:529:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:between the two as an indicator of relative productivity change. We must be cautious here, since a measured 
27:766:74930:24:24:71:534:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:increase in the ratio of Indian to English w/pT will understate the role of own-wage inflation to the extent that 
27:767:75044:24:24:72:540:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:English productivity growth performance was superior to India even before the great factory boom. Our source 
27:768:75153:24:25:71:536:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:for England is Gregory Clark (2004: Table 6 for nominal wages; Table 4 for grain and clothing prices), whose 
27:769:75262:25:24:71:514:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:data allow us to construct the price of clothing relative the grain (pT/pG) 1705-1865 and the own-wage in 
27:770:75368:24:24:72:520:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:textiles (w/pT). Figure 6 plots an index of the ratio of English pT/pG to Indian pT/pG. The Indian series uses 
27:771:75479:24:24:72:518:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:decadal averages due to the volatility of pG in India, and thus starts in 1775, the end of the first decade for 
27:772:75591:24:24:72:526:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f5:which we have data. The price of textiles relative to grains fell in both economies 1765-1850, but it fell five 
27:773:75703:24:24:72:531:227:110:g_d0_f5:110:g_d0_f3:times faster in India due to the much bigger pG boom there. The index of British relative to Indian pT/pG rose 
27:774:75814:24:24:71:539:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:from 100 in 1775 to 228 by 1815, and again to 421 by 1845. Grain prices rose almost four times faster in India 
27:775:75925:24:25:71:536:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:than England, an event which we argue put greater upward pressure on wage costs in India than England, thus 
27:776:76033:25:24:71:522:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:lowering the English own-wage in textiles relative to India. Indeed, the ratio of w/pT in England relative to 
27:777:76143:24:24:71:517:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India fell from 100 in 1775, to 56 in 1815, and to 26 in 1845, as shown in Figure 7. More than half of that 
27:778:76251:24:24:71:529:106:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:century fall was completed by 1805, before the great flood of factory-produced textiles hit Indian markets in 
27:779:76361:24:0:71:464:82:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:the second deindustrialization epoch. But even after 1810, it appears that some part of Indian 
28:780:76698:0:24:72:523:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization was explained by poor productivity performance in grains: after all, pT was pretty much 
28:781:76806:24:25:71:507:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:equalized between India and Britain, so the faster decline in India’s pT/pG implies a poorer productivity 
28:782:76912:25:24:72:531:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:performance in grains there, and perhaps even compared with the rest of the periphery. If we had Indian data 
28:783:77021:24:24:72:522:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:for 1705-1765, we think it would extend these trends backwards. After all, the English pT/pG declined only 
28:784:77128:24:24:72:542:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:modestly between 1705 and 1765,21 and w/pT hardly changed at all. Our guess is that pT/pG fell sharply in India 
28:785:77240:24:24:72:508:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:given that pG about doubled between 1704-1706 and 1764-1766. This added evidence seems to point to 
28:786:77339:24:24:72:530:565:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:reduced agricultural productivity, with its roots in the decline of the Mughal empire and in the secular rise in 
28:787:77452:24:24:72:513:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:drought frequency, as the central cause of Indian deindustrialization in the 18th and even in the early 19th 
28:788:77560:24:25:72:108:517:110:g_d0_f3:49:g_d0_f3:century.

28:790:77568:24:24:142:475:468:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4:6. Indian Relative Price Trends Compared with the Rest of the Periphery  
28:791:77641:24:24:305:308:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3: 
28:792:77641:24:24:108:536:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Deindustrialization appeared everywhere around the 19th century periphery, and globalization plays a 
28:793:77742:24:24:72:515:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:major role in each region’s historiography. Here we ask whether 19th century India faced a big or a small 
28:794:77848:24:24:71:530:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrializing global price shock compared with other parts of the periphery. If India’s global price shock 
28:795:77959:24:25:71:523:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:was small, it follows that domestic supply-side deindustrialization forces were relatively important in India 
28:796:78069:25:24:71:248:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:compared to other parts of the periphery.  
28:797:78112:24:24:107:533:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:Figure 8 shows that India underwent a significant improvement in its terms of trade from 1800 to the 
28:798:78213:24:24:71:509:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:mid-1820s, followed by a collapse, and then a significant rise again up to the early 1860s. Over the half-
28:799:78319:24:24:71:517:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:century between 1800-1804 and 1855-1859, India’s terms of trade rose only 28.6 percent, or less than 0.5 
28:800:78424:24:24:71:528:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:percent per annum. In contrast, the Egyptian terms of trade rose by two and a half times between 1820-1824 
28:801:78531:24:24:71:529:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:and 1855-1859, or 2.7 percent per annum (Figure 9); the Ottoman terms of trade increased by two and a half 
28:802:78638:24:25:72:540:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:times between 1815-1819 and 1855-1859, or 2.4 percent per annum (Figure 10); and the Latin American terms 
28:803:78744:25:69:72:521:154:110:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:of trade increased by 1.7 times between 1820-1824 and 1855-1859, or 1.7 percent per annum (Figure 11).

28:805:78901:7:0:72:524:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:21 Furthermore, the English terms of trade rose over those sixty years (Mitchell and Deane 1962: Table 14, 330). 
29:806:79256:0:24:108:527:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:In short, it appears external price shocks facing India were quite modest compared to the rest of the 
29:807:79358:24:25:72:532:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:periphery.22 Yet, Indian historians discuss deindustrialization more than do historians of other poor periphery 
29:808:79470:25:24:71:535:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:regions. This suggests that domestic supply side conditions played a far more important role in accounting for

29:811:79627:24:24:273:340:589:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4:7. Conclusions 
29:812:79642:24:24:305:308:565:110:g_d0_f4:110:g_d0_f4: 
29:813:79642:24:24:108:483:541:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:India deindustrialized between 1750 and 1860, and two main epochs, with very different 
29:814:79729:24:25:71:526:517:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deindustrialization causes, distinguish that century. The first epoch runs from about 1750 to 1810 and was a 
29:815:79838:25:24:71:521:492:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:direct result of poor climate conditions and an indirect result of the dissolution of the Mughal Empire. The 
29:816:79947:24:24:71:525:468:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:deterioration in climate conditions lowered agricultural productivity, raised grain prices, and thus increased 
29:817:80058:24:24:71:537:444:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:nominal wages in home manufacturing, like textiles, lowering India’s competitiveness with England and other 
29:818:80166:24:24:71:518:420:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:world textile producers. Furthermore, as central authority waned, these forces were strengthened: revenue 
29:819:80272:24:24:71:537:396:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:farming expanded, the rent burden increased, warfare raised the price of agricultural inputs, and regional trade 
29:820:80385:24:24:71:515:372:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:within the sub-continent declined, all serving to drive down the productivity of foodgrain agriculture still 
29:821:80494:24:25:71:533:348:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:further. So grain prices had another reason to rise, and given that ordinary workers lived near subsistence, the 
29:822:80607:25:24:71:527:323:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:nominal wage rose even faster, hurting India’s competitiveness in the export market all the more. India thus 
29:823:80716:24:24:71:542:299:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:lost ground to Britain in the world textile market during a period when most British production was still carried 
29:824:80830:24:24:71:539:275:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:out using the cottage system. Additionally, the intersectoral terms of trade moved against textiles, encouraging 
29:825:80943:24:24:71:541:251:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:a shift to agricultural commodity production. India’s share of world industrial production fell faster than in any 
29:826:81058:24:24:71:488:227:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:other part of the non-European world. During the second epoch, running from about 1810 to 1860, 
29:827:81154:24:24:71:540:203:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:productivity advance resulting from the adoption of the factory system drove down the relative price of textiles 
29:828:81267:24:25:71:513:179:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:world-wide, a trend that was magnified as a world transport revolution lowered the price of textiles even 
29:829:81373:25:24:71:517:154:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:further everywhere in the periphery. Thus, while the productivity of Indian agriculture stopped its decline 
29:830:81481:24:34:71:538:130:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:during this period, under the relative security of Company rule and reinforced by a cessation in the secular rise 
29:831:81595:34:7:216:219:96:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
29:832:81648:7:15:72:522:89:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:22 Terms of trade increases up to the 1860s were also much bigger for Indonesia, Italy and Spain. In addition, after the 
29:833:81769:15:0:71:394:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:1840s their increase was much bigger for Japan and the Mideast (Williamson 2005). 
30:834:82093:0:24:72:532:710:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:in drought frequency, and while the rise in grain prices slowed down and then stabilized, the relative price of 
30:835:82205:24:25:72:523:686:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:grain continued to rise.23 By 1860, India had completed a century-long two-part transition from being a net 
30:836:82313:25:24:72:534:661:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:exporter to a net importer of textiles. A secular rise in the terms of trade stopped, turned around, and started a 
30:837:82428:24:24:72:504:637:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:long run fall that lasted until the late 1930s. A deterioration in the terms of trade meant that the import 
30:838:82536:24:24:72:525:613:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:competing sector (textiles) was no longer being penalized by unfavorable external price shocks. By the late 
30:839:82644:24:471:72:530:589:110:g_d0_f3:110:g_d0_f3:19th century, India’s deindustrialization was over, and the country began a period of slow reindustrialization. 
30:840:82756:471:7:216:219:118:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:                                                      
30:841:82809:7:16:72:535:111:36:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:23 After 1860, global trade in grains changed conditions considerably. Thus, the assumption that grains were non-tradable 
30:842:82931:16:10:72:526:95:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:is increasingly untenable as the late 19th century concludes. We think cheap imported grains (and railroad development 
30:843:83050:10:11:71:532:85:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:within India) may have played a role in lowering the own wage in manufacturing after the 1860s or 1870s, and thus may 
30:844:83168:11:0:71:255:74:90:g_d0_f3:90:g_d0_f3:have contributed to reindustrialization in India.
