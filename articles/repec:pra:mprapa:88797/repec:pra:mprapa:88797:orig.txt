2:22:754:25:13:72:120:577:12:Times New Roman:14:Times New Roman:Abstract 
2:23:762:13:14:72:526:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  present  study investigated  the  existence  of  asymmetry  in  exchange  rate  pass-through  to 
2:24:864:14:14:72:526:550:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer prices in Nigeria by collecting monthly data over the period of 2001 to 2015 from 
2:25:955:14:14:72:525:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:various  sources. Owing  to  the  absence  of  a  long-run  relationship,  results showed  that,  over 
2:26:1057:14:14:72:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  short  term, consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  have  adaptive  expectations;  the  case  of  imported 
2:27:1161:14:13:72:525:508:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  was  also  found;  partial/incomplete  exchange  rate  pass-through was found  over  the 
2:28:1260:13:14:72:526:495:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:short  term  and  the  pass-through  estimates  became  larger  when  the  asymmetric  effect  of 
2:29:1358:14:14:72:526:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange rate changes was considered; differences in the responsiveness of consumer prices 
2:30:1449:14:14:72:526:467:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  exchange  rate  appreciation  and  depreciation  were  also  registered. However, industrial 
2:31:1544:14:14:72:526:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production index had no significant role in the determination of consumer prices in Nigeria. 
2:32:1635:14:13:72:526:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  prevalence  of  imported  inflation  in  the  Nigerian  economy  reflects  the  larger  proportion 
2:33:1739:13:14:72:526:426:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of imported goods in the consumption baskets of Nigerians. To this end, it is suggested that 
2:34:1832:14:14:72:526:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governments  at  all  levels  should  give  adequate  and  timely  incentives  to  local  producers  so 
2:35:1936:14:14:72:526:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  their  products  could  become  affordable.  Nigerians  are  also  encouraged  to  patronize 
2:36:2035:14:14:72:470:384:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“Made-in-Nigeria” products so as to make government policy initiatives effective.

2:41:2188:14:14:90:176:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction 
2:42:2202:14:13:72:526:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Exchange rate pass-through is defined as the percentage change in import price attributed to a 
2:43:2297:13:14:72:526:288:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:certain  percentage  change  in  exchange  rate.  The  extent  to  which  changes  in  exchange  rate 
2:44:2399:14:14:72:526:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:affect  the  domestic price  indices,  majorly,  the  consumer  price  index,  depends  on  the  degree 
2:45:2502:14:14:72:526:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of openness, inflation environment, the credibility of the monetary policy, and exchange rate 
2:46:2596:14:14:72:526:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:volatility,  among  others1.  There  is,  however,  a  growing  argument  in  the  literature  that 
2:47:2696:14:13:72:526:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  pass-through  is  higher  in  developing  and  emerging  economies  than  in 
2:48:2789:13:14:72:448:219:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:developed countries. Previous empirical studies have rather found otherwise2. 
2:49:2866:14:14:72:75:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
2:50:2866:14:14:72:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Both micro and macro channels of exchange rate pass-through have different implications for 
2:51:2958:14:14:72:525:177:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the effectiveness  of  exchange  rate  depreciations  in  improving  the  external  balance  position. 
2:52:3060:14:13:72:523:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:On  the  one  hand,  microeconomic  factors  ensure  that  a  high  level  of  exchange  rate  pass-
2:53:3160:13:14:72:526:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through makes exchange rate depreciations more effective because they create a competitive 
2:54:3251:14:14:72:526:136:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:advantage  for  domestic  producers  that  can  gain  market  share  at  the  expense  of  imports.  On 
2:55:3355:14:25:72:526:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  other  hand,  a  higher  level  of  pass-through  owing  to  macroeconomic  factors  makes 
2:56:3451:25:7:72:218:97:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:                                                           
2:57:3509:7:12:72:393:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:1See Taylor (2000); Choudhri and Hakura (2006); Frimpong and Adam (2010).

3:59:3628:0:14:72:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  depreciations  less  effective  because  it  results  in  higher increases  in  the  prices 
3:60:3735:14:14:72:525:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of non-traded goods and wages, and frustrates any gain in competitiveness brought about by 
3:61:3826:14:14:72:387:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the exchange rate change (Borensztein and von Heideken, 2006).

3:63:3888:14:13:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover, the next strand of argument is the possibility of an asymmetric effect of exchange 
3:64:3981:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate movement on domestic price level. As observed by Ghosh and Rajan (2007), the existing 
3:65:4072:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:literature   suggests   that   the   response   of   exporters   to   exchange   rate   changes   is   often 
3:66:4181:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:asymmetric,  depending  on  whether  the  exchange  rate  appreciates  or  depreciates.  Also,  as 
3:67:4280:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:noted  by  Aron, et  al (2012),  the  import  price  may  not  fall  as  far  with  an  appreciation,  but 
3:68:4386:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:could rise with depreciation as reflected in scarce, but mounting, evidence of various types of 
3:69:4482:13:14:72:284:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nonlinearities in the pass-through literature. 
3:70:4528:14:14:72:78:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  
3:71:4528:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A  number  of  studies  have  been  carried  out  to  examine  the  extent  of  pass-through  to  price 
3:72:4632:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indices  such  as  trade  prices  (import  or  export  prices)  and  consumer  prices.  Virtually,  all  the 
3:73:4741:14:13:72:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:studies  found  an  incomplete  or  partial  pass-through  and  most  of the  studies  concluded  that 
3:74:4844:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange rate pass-through has been declining over time along the price chain, that is, from 
3:75:4937:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:import  prices  to  domestic  consumer  prices3. While  the  majority  of  the  empirical  studies  on 
3:76:5039:14:14:72:525:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  pass-through  ignored  the possibility  of  asymmetric  effect  of  exchange  rate 
3:77:5138:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depreciation and appreciation on price indexes, only few studies captured this effect4. Almost 
3:78:5233:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:all the studies (especially those focused on Nigeria)5 looked at the linear/symmetric effect of 
3:79:5328:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange rate depreciation and appreciation on price indexes while ignoring the possibilities 
3:80:5422:14:14:72:304:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of asymmetric effect of exchange rate changes.  
3:81:5469:14:14:72:75:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
3:82:5469:14:14:72:523:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The present study adds to the literature on accounting for asymmetry in exchange rate pass-
3:83:5560:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through to consumer prices with reference to the Nigerian economy. To this end, the rest of 
3:84:5651:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  study  is  structured  as  follows:  section  two  discusses  theoretical  issues;  section  three 
3:85:5755:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contains a review of the empirical literature; section four uncovers the methodology and data 
3:86:5849:14:14:72:486:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:issues; section five entails the results of empirical analysis, and section six concludes.

3:88:5938:14:13:90:203:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2. Theoretical Issues 
3:89:5958:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The literature on exchange rate pass through to consumer prices relies majorly on the law of 
3:90:6051:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one price (LOP) and the purchasing power parity theory (PPP). The purchasing power parity 
3:91:6141:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(PPP,  subsequently)  doctrine,  in  absolute  version,  states  that  the  equilibrium  exchange  rate 
3:92:6245:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equals  the  ratio  of  domestic  to  foreign  prices.  The  relative  version  of  the  theory  relates 
3:93:6350:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes in the exchange rate to changes in price ratios, that is, inflation differentials (Frenkel, 
3:94:6450:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1976).  The  law  of  one  price  underlies  the  PPP  theory  as  the  former  relates  to  individual 
3:95:6554:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:commodity whereas the latter relates to a bundle of commodities. The law of one price states 
3:96:6647:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that once prices are converted to a common currency, the same good should sell for the same 
3:97:6739:14:14:72:280:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:price in different countries (Rogoff, 1996).

3:99:6783:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  order  to  test  the  validity  of  law  of  one  price  and  purchasing  power  parity  theory  using 
3:100:6890:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:empirical  data  set,  Goldberger  and  Knetter  (1997)  developed  a  framework  appropriate  for 
3:101:6989:14:14:72:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:future  micro-economic  studies  regarding  the  importance  of  the  competitive  structure  in 
3:102:7086:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:international  markets.  Their  framework  is  well  suited  for  explaining  price  adjustments  to 
3:103:7187:14:18:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  movements  and  deviations from  the  law  of  one  price.  The  authors  therefore

4:124:8864:14:14:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mark-up  of  price  over  cost  (industries  are  perfectly  competitive  and  mark-up  is  constant  at 
4:125:8969:14:13:72:526:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:zero) and  (ii) constant marginal costs. Conversely, deviations from the law of one price and 
4:126:9063:13:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incomplete   pass-through   can   to   a   large   extent   be   attributed   to   third-degree   price 
4:127:9167:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:discrimination, which is present when different groups of consumers pay different prices for 
4:128:9260:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:identical  goods;  thus,  two  national  markets  are  segmented  if  buyers  in  those  markets  face 
4:129:9363:14:14:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:systematically  different  common-currency  prices  for  the  same  product  (Goldberger  and 
4:130:9457:14:13:72:525:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Knetter,  1997).  The  latter  proposition  gave  rise  to  a  hypothesis  called  pricing-to-market 
4:131:9558:13:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(PTM)  as  developed  by  Krugman  (1986)  to  explain  how  exporters  adjust  their  mark-ups  in 
4:132:9658:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:response  to  exchange  rate  changes.  PTM  generally  takes  two  forms  and  they  are,  producer 
4:133:9759:14:14:72:350:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:currency pricing (PCP) and local currency pricing (LCP). 
4:134:9815:14:14:72:75:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
4:135:9815:14:13:72:526:413:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Producer currency pricing is a pricing strategy where the exporter prices products in his home 
4:136:9909:13:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country  currency,  whereas  local  currency  pricing  refers  to  a  pricing  behaviour  where  the 
4:137:10010:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exporter  prices  products  in  the  home  currency  of  the  importer.  Since  this  particular  study 
4:138:10114:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:concentrates on investigating the response of prices in the importing country to exchange rate 
4:139:10209:14:14:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes,  the  latter  concept  (that  is,  local  currency  pricing)  is  adopted.  In  that  wise,  if  the 
4:140:10319:14:13:72:526:344:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:currency of the destination market (that is, the importing country) depreciates, then exporters 
4:141:10415:13:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may be willing to absorb this exchange rate changes (by way of reducing their mark-ups) to 
4:142:10506:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:keep local currency price of their products stable and retain market share, thereby giving rise 
4:143:10602:14:14:72:525:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to low or incomplete exchange rate pass-through. However, if the currency of the destination 
4:144:10695:14:14:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market  strengthens  or  appreciates,  the  exporters  leave  their  mark-ups  the  same  so  as  not  to 
4:145:10801:14:13:72:523:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suffer  a  decline  in  their  profits,  a  situation  which  generates  complete  exchange  rate  pass-
4:146:10905:13:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through (Zubair, et al, 2013). In addition, given the decision of exporters in terms of whether 
4:147:11001:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  adjust  their  mark-ups  or  not  in  response  to  exchange  rate  changes,  it  therefore  becomes 
4:148:11106:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:imperative to investigate the asymmetric or differential impacts of exchange rate depreciation 
4:149:11201:14:14:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  appreciation  on  the  domestic  prices  of  the  importing  country,  and  this  constitutes  the 
4:150:11305:14:13:72:269:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:central contribution of the present study.

4:152:11347:15:13:90:291:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3. Review of the Empirical Literature 
4:153:11383:13:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The study conducted by Aliyu, et al (2008) showed that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) 
4:154:11470:14:14:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was significant in Nigeria, though found to be higher in import prices than in consumer prices 
4:155:11565:14:14:72:526:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:during  the  period.  Their  results  suggested  that  ERPT  in  Nigeria  was  partial  and  declining 
4:156:11668:14:13:72:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:along  the  price  chain  contrary  to  the  age-long  belief  in  the  literature  that  ERPT  is  much 
4:157:11773:13:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:higher  in  developing  economies  than  developed  ones.  The  study  by  Frimpong  and  Adam 
4:158:11868:14:14:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2010) validated the  work of Aliyu, et al (2008).  According to  Frimpong  and Adam (2010), 
4:159:11958:14:0:72:526:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  pass-through  to  inflation  was  partial  and  declining  in  Ghana.  The  reason  for 
5:160:12063:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:low but persistent exchange rate pass-through could be traced to the openness of the economy 
5:161:12152:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  the  tight  monetary  policy  the  central  bank  applied  over  the  period.  In  the  same  vein, 
5:162:12257:14:14:72:518:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Zubair, et al (2013) found that exchange rate pass-through in Nigeria is incomplete and low. 
5:163:12347:14:14:72:75:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:164:12347:14:13:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, in contrast to Aliyu, et al (2008), the study conducted by Ogundipe and Egbetokun 
5:165:12436:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2013) found  a large  exchange  rate  pass-through  to  inflation  in  Nigeria.  According  to  the 
5:166:12537:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:authors, the  finding  is  consistent  with  those obtained for  most  developing  countries.  For 
5:167:12635:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instance, Ito, et al (2005), Ca„Zorzi, et al (2007) and Sanusi (2010) found substantially large 
5:168:12728:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pass-through  elasticities  for  several  countries.  Also,  Oyinlola  and  Babatunde  (2009)  found 
5:169:12829:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that exchange rate shocks have a positive effect on import prices, implying that depreciation 
5:170:12923:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:increases  import  prices.  They  also  showed  that  world  export  prices  had  a  dominant  effect 
5:171:13025:14:14:72:526:607:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:compared to exchange rate in explaining changes in Nigeria‟s import prices in the short and 
5:172:13117:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:long run. Moreover, Adelowokan (2012) could not find any evidence of ERPT to inflation in 
5:173:13206:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Nigeria as neither the exchange rate of the Naira vis-à-vis the US dollar nor could its lagged 
5:174:13301:14:13:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:value  influenced consumer  prices.  However,  it  found  evidence  of  the  pass-through  effect  to 
5:175:13402:13:14:72:141:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interest rates.  
5:176:13418:14:14:72:75:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:177:13418:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Razafimahefa  (2012)  analyzed  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  to  domestic  prices  and  its 
5:178:13516:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:determinants   in   sub-Saharan   African   countries.   The   study   found   that   pass-through   is 
5:179:13620:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incomplete.  The  pass-through  is  larger  following  depreciation  than  after  an  appreciation  of 
5:180:13723:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  local  currency.  The  average  elasticity  is  estimated  at  about  0.4.  It  is  lower  in  countries 
5:181:13833:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with more flexible exchange rate regimes and in countries with a higher income. Also, a low 
5:182:13924:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inflation  environment,  a  prudent  monetary  policy,  and  a  sustainable  fiscal  policy  are 
5:183:14021:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:associated  with  a  lower  pass-through. Similarly,  Lopez-Villavicencio  and  Mignon  (2016) 
5:184:14116:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found  that  emerging  economies  share  same  characteristics  with  advanced  countries  in  terms 
5:185:14217:13:14:72:525:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of declining pass-through once inflation is controlled for and that low inflation environment 
5:186:14311:14:14:72:506:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and transparency of monetary policy decisions clearly reduce exchange rate pass-through. 
5:187:14399:14:14:72:75:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
5:188:14399:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In addition, Dube (2016) showed that ERPT declined significantly for producer inflation but 
5:189:14491:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not for consumer inflation after the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) in South Africa. Also, 
5:190:14588:13:14:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:Ca„Zorzi et al. (2007) verified that exchange rate pass-through is higher in import prices than 
5:191:14684:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer prices because of variation across the pricing  chain.  Furthermore, it disproved the 
5:192:14779:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contemplation  that  exchange  rate  pass-though  is  high  in  developing  countries  compared  to 
5:193:14879:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  of  developed  counties  by  arguing  that  for  emerging  countries  with  single  digit  inflation 
5:194:14986:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate entertained low rate of exchange rate pass-through which is not that far from developed 
5:195:15079:13:14:72:525:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:world.  The  study  also  concluded  a  positive  relationship  between  exchange  rate  pass-though 
5:196:15180:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  inflation  rate  which  is  in  line  with Taylor‟s hypothesis. In  his  own  case, Maka  (2013) 
5:197:15281:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found strong evidence of a response in CPI inflation to changes in exchange rate for Ghana. 
5:198:15372:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The response was not immediate but it featured prominently three months into the future and 
5:199:15464:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dissipates  thereafter.    ERPT  is  found  to  be  asymmetric  with  depreciation  having  a  positive 
5:200:15568:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effect  on  CPI  inflation  as  expected  within  the  first  three  months.  Appreciation  on  the  other 
5:201:15675:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:hand has little impact on CPI inflation and has no statistical significance. To differ from the 
5:202:15771:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:studies  reviewed  above,  this  paper  offers  a  new  approach  to  investigate  the  asymmetric 
5:203:15870:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behaviour  of  exchange  rate  pass-through  to  consumer  prices  drawing  evidence  from  the 
5:204:15966:14:13:72:114:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Nigeria.

6:211:16004:13:14:90:337:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:4.1 Estimation Procedure and Model Specification 
6:212:16051:14:14:72:525:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The study adopts the framework of non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL) 
6:213:16141:14:14:72:525:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for the following reasons. First, NARDL model (as in eq. 3 below) allows for both the static 
6:214:16233:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and dynamic effect(s) of the independent variable(s) on the dependent variable unlike a static 
6:215:16327:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:model  that  accounts  for  static  or  fixed  effect(s)  only. Second,  NARDL  framework  offers  a 
6:216:16428:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:technique for checking the existence of a long-run relationship between variables, and that is 
6:217:16523:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:referred to as the Bounds test. Bounds test is flexible as it accommodates both stationary and 
6:218:16618:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:integrated  series  unlike  other  tests  of  cointegration,  such  as,  Engle-Granger  and  Johansen 
6:219:16720:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tests, which considers only non-stationary series that are integrated of the same order. Lastly, 
6:220:16817:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:NARDL allows one to capture the dynamic effect of both positive and negative changes in an 
6:221:16908:14:14:72:342:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:explanatory variable on a particular dependent variable. 
6:222:16964:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Before model estimation using the ordinary least squares (OLS) technique, it is important to 
6:223:17057:14:14:72:525:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:check the time-series properties such  as unit root and cointegration tests to avoid estimating 
6:224:17153:14:13:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spurious  regression.  To  achieve  this,  the  present  study  adopts  the  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller 
6:225:17255:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(ADF)  unit  root  test  and  the  Bounds  test  for  cointegration.  The  ADF  unit  root  test  is 
6:226:17356:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conducted  to  check  if  series  are  stationary  or  not.  The  null  hypothesis  is  that  a  series  has  a 
6:227:17468:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unit  root  or  is  nonstationary.  If  the  ADF  tau  stat  is  greater,  in  absolute  terms,  than  the 
6:228:17575:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:MacKinnon critical values at any chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected; 
6:229:17671:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:otherwise, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root. Similarly, the Bounds test 
6:230:17768:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  cointegration  tests  the  null  hypothesis  that  there  is  no  cointegration  between  consumer 
6:231:17872:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prices  and  naira-dollar  exchange  rate,  after  controlling  for  other  factors,  such  as,  United 
6:232:17976:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:States‟ producer  price  index  and industrial  production  index  in  the  Nigerian  context.  To 
6:233:18074:14:14:72:523:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conclude the presence or absence of cointegration, there is need to compare the computed F-
6:234:18165:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stat  with  the  critical  bound  values,  that  is,  I0  bound  (the  lower  bound)  and  I1  bound  (the 
6:235:18272:13:14:72:525:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:upper bound) at any chosen level of significance. If the F-stat is less than the I0 critical value 
6:236:18371:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:at  any  chosen  level  of  significance,  then  there  is  no  cointegration.  However,  if  the  F-stat  is 
6:237:18481:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:greater   than   the   I1   critical   value   at   any   chosen   level   of   significance,   then   there   is 
6:238:18595:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cointegration. However, if the F-stat lies between the I0 and I1 critical values at all levels of

6:241:18744:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In addition, the estimated models would be subject to post-mortem tests to check if they are 
6:242:18837:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequate for valid and reliable statistical inferences to be made therefrom. In the light of this, 
6:243:18936:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the present study would investigate whether some assumptions underlying the CLRM hold or 
6:244:19025:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not, specifically, linearity, normality, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity tests would be 
6:245:19124:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conducted.  The  associated  null  hypotheses  are,  respectively,  that  the  estimated  model  is 
6:246:19224:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:linear,  have  residuals  that  follow  normal  distribution,  does  not  suffer  from  non-serial 
6:247:19323:14:14:72:525:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:correlation  in  the  residuals,  and  does  not  suffer  from  non-constant  residual  variance.  The 
6:248:19426:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decision  rule  is  that  if  the  probabilities  associated  with  the  test  statistics  of  all  the  tests  are 
6:249:19542:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:greater than 0.1, then the estimated models do not suffer from inadequacy, otherwise, they are 
6:250:19636:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:said  to  be  inadequate  for  policy  prescription.  Of  major  interest  is  the  test  for  asymmetry 
6:251:19741:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(short-run  and/or  long-run)  using  the  Wald  test.  The  null  hypothesis  in  this  case  is  that 
6:252:19845:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer  prices  respond equally  to  exchange  rate  depreciation  and  appreciation.  The 
6:253:19937:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decision  rule  is  that  if  the  probability  associated  with  the  Wald  test  is  greater  than  0.1,  then 
6:254:20050:14:13:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:null of no asymmetry is not rejected. Conversely, if the associated probability is less than or 
6:255:20146:13:14:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:equal  to  0.1,  then  there  is  evidence  of  asymmetric exchange  rate  pass-through  to  consumer 
6:256:20248:14:14:72:157:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prices in Nigeria. 
6:257:20265:14:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:To  this  end,  the  present study adopts  the  modeling  framework of Goldberger  and  Knetter

8:362:23750:14:13:72:526:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:volatile  is  the  US  producer  price  index.  Lastly,  in  terms  of  probability  distribution  as 
8:363:23852:13:14:72:526:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicated by the Jarque-Bera statistic, all the six variables do not follow normal distribution. 
8:364:23948:14:14:72:409:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This result has implications for the stationarity status of the variables.

8:378:24464:14:14:72:526:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table  2  shows  the  result  of  ADF  unit  root  test.  Only  three  variables  including  positive  and 
8:379:24571:14:14:72:526:251:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:negative changes in exchange rate, and log of Nigeria's CPI are stationary at levels, and hence 
8:380:24667:14:14:72:525:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  said  to  be  integrated  of  order  zero,  that  is,  I(0).  The  remaining  three  variables  including 
8:381:24778:14:13:72:526:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the natural logs of US PPI, exchange rate, and industrial production index become stationary 
8:382:24871:13:14:72:526:210:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:only after first differencing, and hence are said to be integrated of order one, that is, I(1). The 
8:383:24971:14:14:72:525:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mixture of I(0) and I(1) requires the use of Bounds test to check if the series are cointegrated

9:407:25759:14:14:72:526:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 3 shows the result of Bounds test for cointegration. It can be observed that irrespective 
9:408:25855:14:13:72:526:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of   specifications   (linear   or   non-linear),   there   exists   no   long-run   relationship   between 
9:409:25963:13:14:72:525:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  and  its  possible  determinants  including  exchange  rate,  United 
9:410:26063:14:14:72:526:528:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:States‟ producer price index and industrial production index. This conclusion is informed by 
9:411:26156:14:14:72:526:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the fact that the F-statistics in both specifications fall below the lower critical bound at 10%

9:428:26646:14:14:72:526:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Since  the  study  could  not  establish  a  long-run  relationship  between  consumer  prices  and  its 
9:429:26751:14:14:72:526:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:determinants in Nigeria, only short-run estimates are presented (see Table 4 below). First and 
9:430:26845:14:13:72:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:foremost,  the  expectations  about  consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  were  found  to  be  adaptive  in 
9:431:26947:13:14:72:526:240:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nature  as  the  previous  value  of  consumer  prices  constitutes  an  important  determinant  of its 
9:432:27051:14:14:72:526:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:current value. Regardless of the specifications considered (that is, symmetric and asymmetric 
9:433:27145:14:14:72:526:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effects  models),  there  is  an  evidence  of  imported  inflation  in  Nigeria  as  the  increase  in 
9:434:27249:14:14:72:526:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production costs as measured by producer price index (PPI) of the exporting country (in this 
9:435:27342:14:13:72:526:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:case,  the  United  States)  is  well  absorbed  into  the  consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  over  the  short 
9:436:27450:13:14:72:526:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:term.  This  finding  reflects  the  large  extent  to  which  the  Nigerian  economy  is  vulnerable  to 
9:437:27556:14:14:72:451:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:external shocks due to its overreliance on external trade (imports and exports). 
9:438:27636:14:14:72:75:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:439:27636:14:14:72:526:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the symmetric-effect models considered (see Models I), the presence of short-run partial or 
9:440:27731:14:13:72:526:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:incomplete exchange rate pass-through was confirmed for the Nigerian economy. This result 
9:441:27821:13:14:72:523:102:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:parallels the  findings  of Razafimahefa  (2012);  Zubair, et  al (2013); Delatte  and  Lopez-
9:442:27912:14:0:72:526:88:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Villavicencio (2012). By accounting for the asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes (see 
10:443:28006:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Model II),   short-run   partial   exchange   rate   pass-through   was   also   obtained.   However, 
10:444:28107:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  pass-through to  consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  was  not  significantly  transmitted 
10:445:28208:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:via  exchange  rate  depreciation  but  through  the  exchange  rate  appreciation  channel.  Besides, 
10:446:28311:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the pass-through estimates associated with exchange rate appreciation (0.609) are greater than 
10:447:28406:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:those associated with exchange rate depreciation (0.028). This finding showed that exporters 
10:448:28497:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:do not alter their mark-ups during appreciation so as not to suffer a profit decline but reduce 
10:449:28593:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their  mark-ups  during  depreciation  in  order  to  maintain  their  market  shares  in  the importing 
10:450:28698:14:14:72:523:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:country  (in  this  case  Nigeria).  This  result  contrasts  with  the  findings  of Delatte  and  Lopez-
10:451:28804:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Villavicencio  (2012)  who  found  asymmetry  in  the  effects  of  exchange  rate  changes  on 
10:452:28900:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer  prices,  and  the  pass-through  estimates  were  higher  for  depreciation  than  for 
10:453:28997:13:14:72:137:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:appreciation. 
10:454:29010:14:14:72:75:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
10:455:29010:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Industrial  production  index  (a  proxy  for  domestic  demand  conditions)  was  found  to  play  an 
10:456:29113:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:insignificant role in price determination in Nigeria, even after accounting for the asymmetric 
10:457:29208:14:13:72:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effects  of  exchange  rate  changes.  A  possible  explanation  for  this  is  that  depreciation  in 
10:458:29311:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange  rate  makes  imports  expensive,  thereby  leading  to  the  shift  in  demand  towards 
10:459:29409:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:locally-made import substitutes by the Nigerian consumers. However, in the short-run, due to 
10:460:29502:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  J-curve  effect,  domestic  consumers  and  producers  do  not  instantaneously  alter  their 
10:461:29601:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behaviour in response to exchange rate changes, thereby lending credence to the insignificant 
10:462:29695:14:13:72:492:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effect of industrial production index on consumer prices in Nigeria over the short term. 
10:463:29783:13:14:72:75:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
10:464:29783:14:14:72:525:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Moreover, the very high adjusted R2 and  F-statistic are indicative of the  greater explanatory 
10:465:29877:14:14:72:525:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:power  of  both  models.  Also, post-estimation/diagnostic  tests,  including  linearity,  normality, 
10:466:29979:14:14:72:525:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:serial  correlation,  heteroscedasticity  and  asymmetric  tests  were  also  conducted  on  the  six 
10:467:30081:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:models. Though the models generally suffer  from non-normality of the residuals, the results 
10:468:30174:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the other three tests (linearity, serial correlation, and heteroscedaticity tests) confirmed the 
10:469:30274:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adequacy  of  the  models  for  policy  prescription  and  the  regression  estimates  are  considered 
10:470:30377:14:14:72:523:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE).  In the same vein, the results of Wald test for short-
10:471:30471:14:14:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:run  asymmetry  showed,  in  a  clear-cut  manner,  of  the  presence  of  asymmetric  effects  of 
10:472:30570:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange rate changes, implying that both appreciation and depreciation of the exchange rate 
10:473:30663:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have dissimilar effects on consumer prices in Nigerian economy over the period considered, 
10:474:30754:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:thereby  justifying  the  obvious  differences  in  pass-through  estimates  associated  with  both 
10:475:30854:14:14:72:289:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exchange rate appreciation and depreciation.

11:517:31989:14:13:72:523:421:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The present study  has so far investigated the  existence of asymmetry in  exchange  rate pass-
11:518:32084:13:14:72:526:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through to consumer prices in Nigeria by collecting monthly data over the period of 2001 to 
11:519:32176:14:14:72:526:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2015 on relevant variables from various sources. The results of model estimation showed that 
11:520:32269:14:14:72:525:380:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumer  prices  in  Nigeria  have  adaptive  expectations;  the  case  of  imported  inflation  was 
11:521:32371:14:13:72:526:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:also found; partial/incomplete exchange rate pass-through was found over the short term and 
11:522:32461:13:14:72:526:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  pass-through  estimates  became  larger  when  the  asymmetric  effect  of  exchange  rate 
11:523:32557:14:14:72:526:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes  was  considered;  differences  in  the  responsiveness  of  consumer  prices  to  exchange 
11:524:32657:14:14:72:526:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate  appreciation  and  depreciation  were  also  registered,  as  the  former  exerts  a  significant 
11:525:32761:14:14:72:526:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:influence on consumer prices, while the latter does not. However, industrial production index 
11:526:32855:14:13:72:526:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has  no  significant  role  in  the  determination  of  consumer  prices  in  Nigeria.  Similarly,  the 
11:527:32959:13:14:72:526:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:results of Wald test for short-run asymmetry showed, in a clear-cut manner, of the presence 
11:528:33051:14:14:72:526:270:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of  asymmetric  effects  of  exchange  rate  changes,  implying  that  both  appreciation  and 
11:529:33146:14:14:72:526:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:depreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  have  dissimilar  effects  on  consumer  prices  in  Nigerian 
11:530:33247:14:14:72:523:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy  over  the  period  considered,  thereby  justifying  the  obvious  differences  in  pass-
11:531:33345:14:23:72:481:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through estimates associated with both exchange rate appreciation and depreciation.  
11:532:33429:23:14:72:525:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Based on the findings of this study, a few policy options should be considered important. The 
11:533:33523:14:14:72:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prevalence of  imported  inflation  in  the  Nigerian  economy  reflects  the  larger  proportion  of 
11:534:33625:14:14:72:526:177:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:imported  goods  in  the  consumption  baskets  of  Nigerians.  To  this  effect,  it  is  suggested that 
11:535:33730:14:14:72:525:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governments  at  all  levels  should  give  adequate  and  timely  incentives  to  local  producers  so 
11:536:33834:14:14:72:526:149:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that  their  products  could  become  affordable.  Nigerians  are  also  encouraged  to  patronize 
11:537:33933:14:13:72:525:135:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:“Made-in-Nigeria” products  so  as  to  make  government  policy  initiatives  effective.  Also, 
11:538:34029:13:14:72:525:122:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:since  exporters   respond  to  exchange  rate  depreciation  differently   from  exchange  rate 
11:539:34126:14:14:72:526:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:appreciation,   the   Central   Bank   of   Nigeria   is   expected   to   live   up   to   expectations   of 
11:540:34236:14:14:72:526:94:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maintaining  a  stable  foreign  exchange  management  so  that  exchange  rate  volatility  can  be 
11:541:34337:14:0:72:122:80:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tamed.
