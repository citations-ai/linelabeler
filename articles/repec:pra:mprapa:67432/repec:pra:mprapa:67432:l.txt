2:22:571:14:14:72:523:578:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In the existing literature much attention has been given to the toolbox of regulatory policy

2:24:758:14:13:72:523:550:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Microeconomic treatment of environmental policy considers the optimal allocation of a given 
2:25:850:13:14:72:523:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:scale  of  resource  flow  within  the  economy,  but  neglects  the  scale  and  composition  of 
2:26:948:14:14:72:522:523:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  activity  relative  to  the  ecosystem  that  supports  it.  An  ecological  approach  to 
2:27:1048:14:14:72:523:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:macroeconomics requires the appreciation of physical constraints to economic growth. This 
2:28:1138:14:14:71:523:495:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:paper presents the theoretical underpinnings and the empirical findings of the literature on the 
2:29:1235:14:13:72:523:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:link  between  economic  growth  and  environmental  quality,  as  well  as  of  the  relationship 
2:30:1334:13:14:71:526:468:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between fiscal policy and environmental degradation, by reviewing the relevant literature. 
2:31:1425:14:14:72:523:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The empirical findings on both relationships are not robust and are therefore inconclusive.

3:50:2161:30:27:107:523:726:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In the existing literature much attention has been given to the toolbox of regulatory 
3:51:2247:27:28:71:523:699:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:policy instruments at the disposal of policy makers for addressing environmental concerns 
3:52:2337:28:27:71:525:671:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Islam  and  Lopez,  2015).  On  the  other  hand,  while  the  effects  of  several  economy3wide 
3:53:2436:27:28:71:523:644:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:policies such as trade policies have been extensively studied, little efforts have been devoted 
3:54:2532:28:28:71:523:616:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to  the  study  of  the  impact  of  fiscal  policy  on  environmental  quality.  This  is  particularly 
3:55:2637:28:27:71:523:588:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:surprising in view of the immense importance of government expenditure in many economies 
3:56:2726:27:28:71:134:561:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:worldwide.   
3:57:2739:28:27:107:523:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  physiocratic1  and  classical  schools2  of  economic  thought,  already  during  the 
3:58:2830:27:28:71:523:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, pointed out the significance of land in the production 
3:59:2922:28:28:71:523:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:process, and highlighted the way of life of natural constraints on economic growth (Harris 
3:60:3013:28:27:71:522:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Codur, 2004). Most notably, Thomas Malthus (1798, 1820) argued that humanity was 
3:61:3098:27:28:71:523:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:trapped in a world where population growth would intensively consume natural resources and 
3:62:3189:28:27:71:523:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:eventually cause, particularly for the lower class, misery and therefore prevent any permanent 
3:63:3284:27:28:71:523:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improvement of their state. Malthus suggested that two types of stabilizers may assist in 
3:64:3374:28:28:71:523:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:holding  population  within  sustainable  limits: positive checks,  which  raise  the  death  rate; 
3:65:3474:28:27:71:523:312:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and preventive checks,  which  lower  the  birth  rate  (Hollander,  1997).  The  positive  checks 
3:66:3573:27:28:71:522:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:include  war,  hunger  and  disease;  the  preventive  checks  birth  control,  abortion, 
3:67:3663:28:27:71:359:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:encouragement of celibacy and postponement of marriage.  
3:68:3720:27:28:107:523:230:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Moreover, Malthus offered no gleam of hope, since he dismissed the effectiveness of 
3:69:3804:28:28:71:523:202:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:several  possible  solutions  to  put  an  end  on  this  vicious  cycle,  such  as  the  argument  that 
3:70:3909:28:27:71:523:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improvements  in  agricultural  productivity  could  satisfy  increasing  nutritional  needs.  It  is 
3:71:4011:27:28:71:522:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:therefore not surprising that with such ominous predictions, Economics were characterized as 
3:72:4104:28:22:71:261:119:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the dismal science (Heilbroner, 1953).  
3:73:4144:22:7:71:218:97:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:                                                 
3:74:4192:7:12:71:422:90:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:1 Includes writers like A.R.J. Turgot, the Marquis de Condorcet and Francois Quesnay. 
3:75:4278:12:0:71:334:78:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:2 Particularly in the writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.  
4:76:4345:0:28:107:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Nevertheless, this inconvenient characterisation of Economics appears highly unfair, 
4:77:4430:28:28:71:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considering that macroeconomic theory was oriented, for more than  a  century, towards a 
4:78:4519:28:27:71:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:hypothesis of continuous growth in GDP and not much attention was given to the relationship 
4:79:4611:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between economic growth and environmental degradation until early 1970s. It was indeed 
4:80:4698:28:27:71:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this neglection that led Brock (1973) to argue that growth theory is biased, since it does not 
4:81:4793:27:28:71:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:explicitly take into account the environmental costs of economic growth. On a similar note, 
4:82:4885:28:28:71:522:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Daly (1990) pointed out the failure of an ‘‘environmental macroeconomics’’ to emerge, apart 
4:83:4977:28:27:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from the efforts to consider environmental factors in national accounting, which were already 
4:84:5071:27:28:71:522:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:being  developed  during  the  1990s.  Microeconomic  treatment  of  environmental  policy 
4:85:5162:28:27:71:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considers the optimal allocation of a given scale of resource flow within the economy but 
4:86:5252:27:28:71:522:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:neglects  the  scale  and  composition  of  economic  activity  relative  to  the  ecosystem  that 
4:87:5351:28:28:71:523:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:supports it (Daly 1991; Heyes, 2000). An ecological approach to macroeconomics requires 
4:88:5439:28:27:71:438:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the appreciation of physical constraints to economic growth (Harris, 2009).  
4:89:5516:27:28:107:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical 
4:90:5604:28:27:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:underpinnings  and  the  empirical  findings  of  the  literature  on  the  link  between  economic 
4:91:5704:27:28:71:523:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth and environmental quality, while Section 3 does the same for the relationship between 
4:92:5797:28:28:71:523:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fiscal policy and environmental degradation. Section 4 provides conclusions and directions 
4:93:5888:28:0:71:165:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for future research.

5:97:6009:28:27:107:523:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A fundamental theoretical tool of macroeconomic theory is the circular flow model of 
5:98:6094:27:28:72:523:639:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an economic system. In its standard form, this model describes the exchange of services and 
5:99:6186:28:27:72:523:611:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:goods,  as  well  the  supply  and  demand  of  factors  of production  between  two  types  of 
5:100:6282:27:28:72:523:584:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  actors,  namely  consumers  (households)  and producers  (firms).  However,  the 
5:101:6373:28:28:72:523:556:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environment  and  the  natural  resources,  which  support  the  production  process,  are  not 
5:102:6469:28:27:72:308:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered in the standard version of this model. 
5:103:6519:27:28:108:522:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:According to contemporary economic theory, an economy has at least three factors 
5:104:6600:28:27:71:523:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that contribute to production and eventually to economic growth and welfare: human capital, 
5:105:6692:27:28:71:523:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:physical  capital  and  natural  capital  (Lopez  et  al.,  2010).  Natural  capital  in  particular, 
5:106:6794:28:27:71:523:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:comprises natural resources as well as environmental quality. Therefore, the standard circular 
5:107:6889:27:28:71:523:391:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:flow model can be enhanced by the introduction of the biosphere as ‘‘a provider of natural 
5:108:6980:28:28:71:523:363:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:resources  and  also  as  the  receptor  of  various  undesirable  outputs  of  the 
5:109:7064:28:27:71:515:335:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f7:B:production/consumption processes, i.e. of pollution and wastes’’ (Harris and Codur, 2004).  
5:110:7156:27:28:107:523:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Following Harris and Codur (2004), we may consider the entire economic activity to 
5:111:7239:28:27:71:522:280:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:be embedded in the biosphere. Related to this, Kumbhakar and Tsionas (2015) examined the 
5:112:7328:27:28:71:523:253:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental  production  process  (for  example,  during  the  production  of  electricity)  and 
5:113:7427:28:28:71:523:225:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emphasized  the  existence  of  inefficiencies  in  by3product  technologies,  which  implies  that 
5:114:7527:28:27:71:526:197:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:more  than  the  minimal  amounts  of  the  undesirable  outputs  are  produced  (SO2  and  NOx

5:116:7713:28:27:71:523:142:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that, given a level of inputs, less than the maximum possible level of desirable outputs is

6:130:8338:28:27:108:523:140:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:During recent decades, the increasing urgency of environmental problems, both in 
6:131:8419:27:28:72:523:113:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:national  and  global  levels,  provoked  a  growing  body  of  research  that  incorporate 
6:132:8511:28:0:72:522:85:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental pollution factors in growth models and explicitly explores the relationships 
7:133:8604:0:28:71:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between  economic  growth,  capital  accumulation  and  environmental  degradation.  The 
7:134:8693:28:28:71:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:foundation of these models is the acknowledgement of a flow of waste material as a by3
7:135:8779:28:27:71:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:product of the production process, which deteriorates the environment and possibly the factor 
7:136:8873:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:productivity.  Moreover,  in  these  models  environmental  quality  is  positively  valued  by 
7:137:8969:28:27:71:133:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:individuals.  
7:138:8983:27:28:107:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:According to Xepapadeas (2005) and assuming that the flow of emissions is related

7:140:9157:28:28:71:158:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can be written as:

7:142:9248:32:27:71:523:505:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:where Kp is the pollution generating capital, AL represent effective labour that allows for 
7:143:9340:27:29:72:522:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:labour  augmenting  technical  change  and  Ka  is  the  abatement  capital  which  helps  reduce 
7:144:9438:29:31:71:522:449:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution levels. The flow of emissions can be represented as ()YKZαφ=where φ depicts 
7:145:9524:31:30:71:523:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emissions  per  unit  of  output  and ()0'<Kφ,  assuming  existence  of  emissions  reducing

7:157:10053:37:27:71:526:202:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by assuming that individuals derive satisfaction from the consumption of goods as well as 
7:158:10143:27:29:71:491:175:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from the quality of the environment. Hence, the utility function for the ith individual is:

8:174:10623:28:27:107:522:647:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The development of the models that explore the interrelationships between economic 
8:175:10706:27:28:71:523:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth and the environment is closely linked to the evolution of growth theory. As already 
8:176:10797:28:28:71:522:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:discussed in Chapter 1, the first wave of models constituting the neoclassical growth theory, 
8:177:10891:28:27:71:523:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered technical change as exogenous and the role of government policy to be limited, 
8:178:10981:27:28:71:403:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with no effect on the exogenously determined long3run growth rate.  
8:179:11049:28:27:107:522:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:On the other hand, endogenous growth theory incorporated technological progress as 
8:180:11132:27:28:71:523:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an endogenous factor, which allowed the determination of the growth rate endogenously in 
8:181:11221:28:28:71:523:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the model and eventually offered the theoretical framework for a more active and efficient 
8:182:11312:28:27:71:523:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:role for government policy. Therefore, following the classification and analytical framework 
8:183:11405:27:28:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:proposed by Xepapadeas (2005) the predictions and policy implications of three types of 
8:184:11493:28:27:71:523:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:related  theories  are  briefly  presented  below,  namely  models  with  fixed  savings  ratio  and 
8:185:11594:27:28:71:523:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exogenous technical change, optimal growth models with exogenous technical change and 
8:186:11680:28:29:71:258:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:finally, endogenous growth models.     
8:187:11719:29:27:89:278:287:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Models with a fixed savings ratio 
8:188:11754:27:28:71:522:260:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:These models consider that the savings ratio is fixed and no related optimization process is 
8:189:11847:28:27:71:523:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:followed  by  individuals.  In  addition,  the  degradation  of  environmental  quality  does  not 
8:190:11946:27:28:71:523:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reduce utility and is therefore not taken into account, a situation that may in some cases not 
8:191:12041:28:27:71:523:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:deviate from reality, for instance in industrialised societies. Under these assumptions, at the 
8:192:12137:27:28:71:522:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:steady3state environmental pollution grows at the fixed rate n + g, where n and g represent 
8:193:12229:28:28:71:523:122:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  exogenous  rates  of  population  and  labour  augmenting  technology  growth  rates, 
8:194:12320:28:0:71:138:94:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:respectively.  
9:195:12337:0:28:107:522:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Therefore, accumulation of pollution would only cease when there is no exogenous 
9:196:12418:28:28:71:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth,  i.e.  when  n  =  g  =  0  and  the  economy  also  stops  growing.  The  introduction  of 
9:197:12518:28:27:71:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emissions  reducing  technologies  in  this  model  is  one  way  to  sufficiently  prevent  the 
9:198:12615:27:28:71:522:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:accumulation  of  pollution  as  the  economy  grows.  In this  case  the  level  of  steady3state 
9:199:12714:28:27:71:491:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution is reduced, albeit pollution in physical units still grows at an exogenous rate.  
9:200:12806:27:28:107:526:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Apparently,  an  equilibrium  steady3state  level  of  pollution  might  not  exist  in  the 
9:201:12899:28:28:71:522:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:aforementioned basic model. This could be achieved if the flow of emissions is incorporated 
9:202:12991:28:27:71:522:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:as an input in the production function, as in Eq. (2), and could be justified as a maximum 
9:203:13082:27:28:71:522:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:level of emissions imposed by emission standards or by technological constraints. In this 
9:204:13172:28:27:71:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model the steady3state growth rates of the main variables in per capita terms are constant and 
9:205:13267:27:28:71:522:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:determined exogenously, while the steady3state levels of these variables are determined by 
9:206:13358:28:28:71:231:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the specified level of emissions.  
9:207:13393:28:27:107:523:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Moreover, due to nonlinearities, certain levels of the specified environmental standard 
9:208:13481:27:28:71:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:might result in the fast accumulation of pollution which may be difficult, or even impossible, 
9:209:13576:28:27:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to reverse. Xepapadeas (2005) points out that such an environmental trap may be likely in 
9:210:13666:27:28:71:523:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this case, since environmental standards are not set in an optimum way based on the disutility 
9:211:13761:28:29:71:244:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:related to environmental pollution.  
9:212:13798:29:27:89:240:288:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Optimal growth models    
9:213:13824:27:28:107:522:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In these models, environmental considerations are explicitly taken into account by 
9:214:13907:28:27:71:522:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:introducing the utility function of the representative household. However, the steady state for 
9:215:14003:27:28:71:523:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  competitive  economy  has  the  same  characteristics  as  the  standard  Ramsey–Cass–
9:216:14094:28:28:71:522:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Koopmans model without environmental pollution, with only the growth rate of consumption 
9:217:14183:28:27:71:523:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:being  lowered.  This  result  reflects  the  fact  that  producers  do  not  take  into  account  the 
9:218:14286:27:28:71:523:123:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:disutility from pollution, environmental degradation will continue as long as the economy 
9:219:14376:28:0:71:487:95:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:grows at an exogenous rate, and that there are diminishing returns in physical capital.  
10:220:14467:0:28:107:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:On the other hand, as expected due to environmental externalities, the optimal levels 
10:221:14553:28:28:71:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of the main variables are reduced when the optimization problem of the social planner is 
10:222:14642:28:27:71:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:taken  into  account.  This  result  may  be  achieved  by imposing  environmental  taxes  or 
10:223:14736:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:introducing  abatement  activities  that  diverge  resources  from  capital  formation  or 
10:224:14827:28:27:71:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption.  The  achieved  steady  state  levels  are  reduced  compared  to  the  competitive 
10:225:14924:27:28:71:526:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equilibrium, due to the internalization of environmental externalities by the social planner.  
10:226:15019:28:28:71:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:However, also in this case, the growth rates are not affected by environmental concerns, since 
10:227:15114:28:28:71:266:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these rates are determined exogenously. 
10:228:15154:28:28:89:251:537:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Endogenous growth models 
10:229:15180:28:27:107:523:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Endogenous growth theory defines capital in the broad sense to include human capital 
10:230:15265:27:28:71:523:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  therefore  constant  returns  are  achieved.  Moreover,  if  the  occurrence  of  diminishing 
10:231:15364:28:28:71:523:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:returns in the abatement sector is prevented, it is possible to have sustained growth without 
10:232:15458:28:27:71:523:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution accummulation. The fundamental factor that leads to growth is the accumulation of 
10:233:15550:27:28:71:523:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:knowledge which is considered a public good while technological progress is endogenous, 
10:234:15638:28:27:71:523:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and driven by investment in R&D, in expectation of future monopolistic profits. Therefore, in 
10:235:15732:27:28:71:523:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the framework of endogenous growth models with an environmental dimension, growth rates 
10:236:15820:28:28:71:523:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can be affected by government policies that internalize the negative externalities linked with 
10:237:15915:28:27:71:523:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution and positive externalities associated with the knowledge accumulation and human 
10:238:16005:27:28:71:112:261:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital.  
10:239:16015:28:27:107:523:233:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:These  policies  include  public  expenditure  in  education,  R&D  and  health, 
10:240:16096:27:28:71:523:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental taxes, maintenance of public order, as well as regulations of international trade 
10:241:16192:28:28:71:522:178:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and environmental protection. Environmental policies can be distinguished between market3
10:242:16281:28:27:71:523:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:based instruments and regulatory instruments. Bithas (2011) emphasized the need to combine 
10:243:16372:27:28:71:522:123:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:both types of instruments to ensure sustainability, since in order to satisfy the necessary and 
10:244:16468:28:0:71:523:95:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sufficient conditions for it, the intertemporal externalities should be internalized alongside the 
11:245:16570:0:28:72:522:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interspatial  externalities.  In  particular,  conventional  environmental  policy  instruments  can 
11:246:16671:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ensure the  environmental welfare of  current  generations and achieve allocative  efficiency 
11:247:16765:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:under existing economic and social conditions (Bithas, 2006). Nevertheless, command and 
11:248:16853:27:28:72:522:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:control instruments, suitably designed to reflect absolute ecological targets which respect the 
11:249:16949:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental rights of future generations, could complement payment rules and provide the 
11:250:17040:27:28:72:263:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sufficient conditions for sustainability.

11:253:17108:30:27:71:272:533:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:2.2.1. The Environmental Kuznets Curve 
11:254:17147:27:28:107:523:506:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A  thorough  examination  of  the  growth  models  sketched  in  the  previous  section 
11:255:17235:28:28:71:522:478:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:suggests that, at least from a theoretical point of view, there are important interrelationships 
11:256:17332:28:27:71:523:450:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between economic growth and the environment while the exact magnitude and sign of this 
11:257:17419:27:28:71:523:423:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationship  depends  on  several  factors.  As  Xepapadeas  (2005)  points  out,  growth  theory 
11:258:17518:28:27:71:523:395:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provides  indeterminate  evidence  regarding  this  relationship.  First,  if  disutility  from 
11:259:17614:27:28:71:523:368:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental  degradation  is  not  considered,  environmental  quality  might  degrade  with 
11:260:17709:28:28:71:523:340:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  if  externalities  of  pollution  are  taken  into  account, 
11:261:17812:28:27:71:523:312:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental concerns might limit growth if the productivity of capital in production and 
11:262:17903:27:28:71:351:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution abatement tends to zero as capital accumulates.  
11:263:17962:28:27:107:523:257:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Finally, sustained growth could be associated with stable pollution in the presence of 
11:264:18049:27:28:71:523:230:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:non3diminishing  returns  in  abatement  processes  or  output  production.  Nevertheless,  it  is 
11:265:18148:28:28:71:522:202:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:important to explore which of these mechanisms are confirmed by empirical evidence. Thus, 
11:266:18238:28:27:71:523:174:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a great deal of empirical work, sought to test the relationship between per capita income and 
11:267:18332:27:28:71:523:147:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the environment, was undertaken during the 1990s and still consists an active research field 
11:268:18425:28:0:71:221:119:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of Environmental Economics.  
12:269:18457:0:28:108:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Much  of  the  studies  that  explore  the  relationship  between  economic  growth  and 
12:270:18546:28:28:72:522:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental degradation test the hypothesis of the existence of the Environmental Kuznets 
12:271:18638:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Curve (EKC). This terminology is related to the work of Kuznets (1955) who hypothesized 
12:272:18726:27:28:72:522:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an inverted3U shape relationship between an indicator of income inequality and the level of 
12:273:18818:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  growth.  The  EKC  hypothesis  posits  that  during  the  early  stages  of  economic 
12:274:18914:27:28:72:522:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:development  environmental  degradation  increases,  until  a  threshold  level  of  income  is 
12:275:19010:28:28:72:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reached and thereafter improvements in environmental quality are achieved. This relationship 
12:276:19103:28:28:72:188:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is depicted in Figure 2.

13:283:19279:28:28:108:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:According to the literature which identifies several factors that lead to the existence of 
13:284:19370:28:27:71:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the EKC, the main determinants of the growth3pollution relationship may be categorized as 
13:285:19460:27:29:71:488:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:follows (Halkos, 2013b; Panayotou, 2003; Alstine and Neumayer, 2010; Stern, 2014): 
13:286:19543:29:27:89:168:647:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Scale effect 
13:287:19557:27:28:107:522:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The expansion of production, ceteris paribus, i.e. with the mix of products produced, 
13:288:19643:28:28:71:523:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the mix of production inputs used, and the state of technology all held constant, increases 
13:289:19735:28:27:71:523:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental  pressures  and  is  associated  with  deterioration  of  environmental  quality 
13:290:19830:27:29:71:199:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Panayotou, 1993, 1997).  
13:291:19856:29:27:89:206:508:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Composition effect 
13:292:19876:27:28:107:523:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:During the course of economic development the output mix of the economy changes 
13:293:19956:28:27:71:523:453:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Janicke  et  al.,  1997;  Copeland  and  Taylor,  2004). In  particular,  at  the  early  stages  of 
13:294:20058:27:28:71:526:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  development  as  the  rural  sector  contributes  the  larger  percentage  of  GDP, 
13:295:20152:28:28:71:522:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental pollution is minimum. However, as the economy develops and the role of 
13:296:20237:28:27:71:523:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:industries  becomes  more  important,  environmental  pressures  progressively  increase.  This 
13:297:20333:27:28:71:523:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution intensity is eventually relieved as the economy further grows and relies more on the 
13:298:20428:28:29:71:149:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:service sector.   
13:299:20446:29:27:89:195:286:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Technique effect 
13:300:20464:27:27:107:522:259:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The technique effect is associated with three distinct mechanisms that may reduce 
13:301:20546:27:28:71:523:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental pressures, depending on the elasticity of substitution in production (Lopez, 
13:302:20637:28:28:71:523:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1994;  Grossman  and  Krueger,  1995;  de  Bruyn  and  Opschoor,  1997;  Han  and  Chatterjee, 
13:303:20732:28:27:71:523:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1997). Firstly, it involves the modification of inputs mix employed in production, in such a 
13:304:20825:27:28:71:523:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:way  as  to  substitute  pollution  intensive  factors  with  other  which  are  environmentally 
13:305:20922:28:27:71:523:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:friendlier. Moreover, as an economy grows, its capabilities in supporting R&D expenditure 
13:306:21012:27:0:71:523:94:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:increase, eventually leading to improvements in the state of technology.  Thereafter, these 
14:307:21107:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improvements  lead  to  the  introduction  and  diffusion  of  cleaner  technologies,  which  may 
14:308:21205:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:substitute older ones that were more pollution intensive. Finally, new technologies enhance 
14:309:21297:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the productivity of physical capital and therefore limit the use of pollution intensive inputs 
14:310:21392:27:29:71:164:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:per unit of output.  
14:311:21413:29:27:90:289:647:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Demand for environmental quality 
14:312:21447:27:28:107:523:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:As  income  increases,  demand  for  environmental  quality  also  rises,  implying  that 
14:313:21537:28:28:72:523:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental quality is a normal  good, i.e. its income elasticity is positive (Beckerman, 
14:314:21629:28:27:72:523:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1992). In developing countries, demand for environmental quality is rather small but, as the 
14:315:21722:27:28:72:523:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economy  grows,  environmental  concerns  rise  and  demand  for  enhanced  environmental 
14:316:21812:28:27:72:522:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quality shifts out. This effect is also related with the Frisch coefficient of preferences which 
14:317:21909:27:28:72:523:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reflects how the value of goods declines with income, in particular how the marginal utility of 
14:318:22005:28:29:72:295:454:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:income declines with income (Lopez, 1994).   
14:319:22050:29:27:89:208:425:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:A:• International trade 
14:320:22070:27:28:107:523:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Many studies have shown that the existence of the EKC may reflect the changing 
14:321:22149:28:27:72:523:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:scale,  composition  and  technique  patterns  that  are associated  with  liberalized  trade  and 
14:322:22248:27:28:72:523:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  growth  (Alstine  and  Neumayer,  2010;  Grossman  et  al.,  1993,  1995;  Heil  and 
14:323:22343:28:27:72:523:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Selden, 2001; Suri and Chapman, 1998). According to Halkos (2013a) the environmental 
14:324:22428:27:28:72:523:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effect  of  trade  liberalization  may  be  decomposed  into  three  distinct  effects.  First  of  all, 
14:325:22533:28:28:72:523:260:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental degradation may increase through the scale effect due to the increased volume 
14:326:22625:28:27:72:247:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of international trade (scale effect).  
14:327:22665:27:28:108:522:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:On the other hand, international trade is associated with implementation of stricter 
14:328:22750:28:27:72:523:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental  regulations,  which  promote  technological  advances  that  reduce  pollution 
14:329:22844:27:28:72:523:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:levels (technique effect). Finally, the composition effect may increase pollution in developing 
14:330:22940:28:28:72:523:122:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:countries  by  encouraging  the  establishment  of  new  industries  which  are  more  pollution 
14:331:23037:28:0:72:523:94:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:intensive,  particularly  in  view  of  the  lower  environmental  standards  of  these  countries 
15:332:23139:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(displacement  hypothesis3).  Furthermore,  the pollution  haven  hypothesis  may  explain  the

15:345:24061:27:28:71:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Consequently, the ‘turning point’ can be calculated by the level of per capita income at which

15:349:24425:28:27:72:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In  each  regression,  they  employed  a  cubic  specification  of  the  level  of  PPP  adjusted  per 
15:350:24528:27:28:72:523:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capita GDP and controlled for various site3related variables and a time trend. The turning 
15:351:24619:28:28:71:523:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:points for SO2 and dark matter were estimated between $4,00035,000, while the concentration

16:365:25810:27:28:107:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A recurring pattern in the literature, is that an EKC exists for pollutants with semi3

16:368:26088:28:28:72:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environment, no turning point is confirmed. These aspects include CO2 emissions (Shafik,

16:371:26369:28:27:72:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:EKC holds for those measures of environmental pollution that have significant implications 
16:372:26460:27:28:72:523:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:on human health and/or may not be easily externalized; these tend to improve already at low 
16:373:26552:28:28:72:522:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:levels of income. On the other hand, those indicators that have the characteristics of global

16:375:26750:27:28:72:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  growth  since  they  have  historically  not  been  subject  to  particular  regulation 
16:376:26848:28:27:72:227:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Alstine and Neumayer, 2010).  
16:377:26879:27:28:108:523:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In a related common finding, the turning points for emissions of each pollutant are

16:379:27055:28:27:72:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Song, 1994). According to Stern (2014), a plausible explanation for this finding is that in the 
16:380:27151:27:28:72:523:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:initial stages of economic development urban and industrial development tends to concentrate 
16:381:27244:28:27:72:522:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:more in a smaller number of cities, which also have rising population densities, while the 
16:382:27335:27:28:72:523:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:opposite is happening during the later stages of economic growth. Therefore, it is not unlikely 
16:383:27431:28:28:72:523:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to observe declining pollution concentrations as income rises, even if total national emissions

17:389:27858:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:concentrations do not provide the most proper indicator of environmental impact (Halkos and 
17:390:27950:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Tsionas, 2001). Moreover, the use of emission indicators avoids dependence of the estimated 
17:391:28042:28:27:72:429:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:results on geographic location characteristics and atmospheric conditions. 
17:392:28117:27:28:108:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Despite the overwhelming presence of empirical studies on the existence of the EKC, 
17:393:28201:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:there are a growing number of studies that have suggested that several other factors must be 
17:394:28294:27:28:72:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:taken into account before drawing robust conclusions. Halkos and Tsionas (2001) argued that 
17:395:28386:28:28:72:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the EKC hypothesis may be a function of income and employed regime switching models on 
17:396:28473:28:27:72:522:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a  cross3section  of  developing  and  developed  countries,  explicitly  taking  into  account  the 
17:397:28574:27:28:71:522:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:presence of non3linearities. Their results suggested that there is an increasing relationship 
17:398:28668:28:27:71:416:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between two pollution indicators (CO2 and deforestation) and income.

17:400:28823:28:28:72:523:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emissions are very sensitive to the choice of sample used in the analysis. In particular, they 
17:401:28918:28:27:72:523:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:found that SO2 emissions per capita were a monotonic function of income per capita when 
17:402:29006:27:28:71:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:they used a global sample and an inverted U3shape function of income in a sample of OECD 
17:403:29095:28:27:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:countries  only.  Halkos  (2003)  highlighted  the  existence  of  dynamics  in  the  examined 
17:404:29190:27:28:71:522:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationships and proposed the use of dynamic econometric methods. In particular, using the 
17:405:29282:28:28:71:523:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:same database as Stern and Common (2001), but employing a dynamic model formulation, 
17:406:29367:28:27:71:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:he found much lower turning points, well within the sample levels of income, in the range of 
17:407:29460:27:28:71:523:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:$2,805–$6,230 and confirmed existence of inverted U3shape curves. The differences in the 
17:408:29549:28:27:71:523:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:extracted  relationships  between  these  studies,  as  well  as  the  differences  in  the  estimated 
17:409:29652:27:28:71:523:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:turning points may be, solely, attributed to the econometric models’ functional form used and 
17:410:29746:28:28:71:283:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the adoption of static or dynamic analysis.   
17:411:29792:28:27:107:523:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Related  to  the  aforementioned  issues,  if  the  environmental  indicator  used  in  the 
17:412:29884:27:28:71:522:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:analysis and GDP are non3stationary, i.e. they show a common trend over time, then spurious 
17:413:29976:28:0:71:523:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regression results may be reported. Tests for integrated variables designed for use with panel

18:415:30175:28:28:72:522:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Stern, 2014). Therefore regression estimates by using time series or panel data are reliable 
18:416:30269:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:only if the regression exhibits co3integration, i.e. there is a long3term relationship between the 
18:417:30368:27:28:72:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:models  variables.  Otherwise,  the  model  must  be  estimated  by  the  use  of  alternative 
18:418:30463:28:27:72:522:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:approaches such as first differences or the between estimator, which first averages the data 
18:419:30556:27:28:72:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:over time (Stern, 2010). According to Alstine and Neumayer (2010), only a small number of 
18:420:30646:28:28:72:522:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:studies have addressed this potential problem properly (for example, Galeotti, Manera, and

18:423:30901:28:27:72:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the EKC empirical specifications, in order to avoid potential omitted variable bias that 
18:424:30993:27:28:72:523:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:could  influence  the  relationship  between  economic  growth  and  the  environment.  These

18:435:31826:28:28:71:523:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quasi3automatic or policy induced (Alstine and Neumayer, 2010; Grossman et al., 1995). A

18:437:32003:27:0:71:523:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution  could  be  attributed  to  policy  distortions  in  the  form  of  under3pricing  of  natural 
19:438:32111:0:28:72:522:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:resources and subsidies to energy and agrochemicals, which are destructive both in terms of 
19:439:32203:28:28:72:410:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic efficiency and environmental perspectives (Halkos 2013a).  
19:440:32271:28:27:108:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Governments can flatten out their EKC by confining policy distortions that lead to 
19:441:32354:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:market failures, reinforcing the establishment of property rights over natural resources and in 
19:442:32450:28:27:71:522:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:general, opt to internalize environmental externalities to the sources that generate them by 
19:443:32543:27:28:71:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:enforcing  stricter  environmental  regulations  (Panayotou,  1993).  Regulatory  institutions, 
19:444:32639:28:28:71:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:normative institutions, and the beliefs and values that are imposed on, or internalized by, 
19:445:32731:28:27:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:social  actors  may  also  determine  corporate  decisions’  and  shape  corporate  social

19:448:32934:27:28:107:523:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Related to this, Jones et.al (2010, 2012) stressed the need to increase environmental

19:450:33116:28:27:71:523:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:spillovers and the importance of increasing citizens’ participation during the decision3making 
19:451:33211:27:28:71:522:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:phase of environmental policy. These factors may further alleviate environmental degradation 
19:452:33304:28:27:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by increasing citizens’ environmental awareness and willingness to pay for environmental

19:454:33486:28:28:71:213:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of these policy implications.  
19:455:33517:28:27:107:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Considering  developing  countries,  if  the  technique effect  is  emphasized  through 
19:456:33605:27:28:71:523:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:policy, then these countries may be able to ease their way through the EKC, as abatement 
19:457:33694:28:27:71:523:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:already exist. Therefore, there is a need for technology transfer and abatement assistance to 
19:458:33788:27:28:71:523:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:developing  countries  to  achieve  sustainability,  since  production  methods  in  developed 
19:459:33883:28:28:71:522:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:countries are relatively less pollution intensive. Finally, the finding that the EKC increases 
19:460:33978:28:27:71:522:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:monotonically  for  pollutants  with  more  global  externalities  highlights  the  need  for  the 
19:461:34077:27:28:71:523:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:establishment  of  international  environmental  treaties  and  cooperation,  which  will  aid  the

20:470:34533:28:27:72:523:241:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(1651).  On the other hand, Adam Smith (1776) has argued that governments should limit 
20:471:34620:27:28:72:523:214:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their tasks to fundamental functions such as protecting property rights and ensuring the rule 
20:472:34714:28:27:72:522:186:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of law and order, otherwise economic growth and welfare would be significantly deteriorated. 
20:473:34807:27:28:71:523:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Nevertheless, he has warned against the complete confinement of the state, since this would 
20:474:34899:28:28:72:523:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lead to detrimental effects and social disorder. Moreover, Adolf Wagner’s law suggests that 
20:475:34991:28:0:72:523:103:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the size of government tends to increase with the level of income in order to maintain the 
21:476:35085:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:same  level  of  administrative  and  law  enforcement  functions,  as  well  as  to  ensure  the 
21:477:35183:28:28:72:440:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:necessary provision of public goods and the alleviation of market failures8.   
21:478:35262:28:27:107:522:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Nowadays, in most countries a large part of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is being 
21:479:35344:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:spent  through  government  consumption  and  investment.  In  particular,  the  share  of 
21:480:35435:28:27:71:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government expenditure in GDP increased in most developed countries during the period 
21:481:35521:27:28:71:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1970–1995,  in  an  attempt  to  alleviate  the  effect  of  business  cycles  and  achieve  income 
21:482:35621:28:28:71:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equality. This trend reverted during the period 1995 – 2005, in order to confine increasing 
21:483:35713:28:27:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:public debt ratios, but subsequently increased again, as several governments have followed 
21:484:35804:27:28:71:523:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expansionary  macroeconomic  policies  to  support  and expedite  the  recovery  of  their 
21:485:35895:28:27:71:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economies in response to the economic crisis that initiated in 2008. The evolution of the size 
21:486:35990:27:28:71:523:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  government  expenditure  from  1970  to  2013,  for  a sample  of  28  OECD  countries,  is 
21:487:36086:28:28:71:523:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:depicted in Table 1. Despite renewed recent attempts to reduce government expenditure, still 
21:488:36179:28:27:71:381:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:an average of more than 45% of GDP is spent by governments.  
21:489:36240:27:28:107:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  economic  implications  of  government  expenditure  have  been  shown  to  be 
21:490:36324:28:27:71:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:significant  and  broad,  however  the  empirical  evidence  concerning  the  qualitative 
21:491:36414:27:28:71:523:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:characteristics of these relationships remain inconclusive. In particular, government spending 
21:492:36509:28:28:71:523:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has  been  shown  to  enhance  long3run  economic  growth by  increasing  the  level  of  human 
21:493:36605:28:27:71:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital  and  Research  and  Development  (R&D)  expenditure,  and  by  improving  public 
21:494:36695:27:28:71:523:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:infrastructure (Ram, 1986; Ghali, 1998; Dalamagas, 2000; Agenor and Neanidis, 2006). In 
21:495:36783:28:27:71:522:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:contrast to the above, there is evidence that a greater size of government spending may be 
21:496:36874:27:28:71:523:207:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:less efficient and therefore not necessarily associated with a better provision of public goods

22:537:40317:38:27:107:523:311:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Moreover, it is likely that the size of government expenditure and its composition are 
22:538:40404:27:28:72:523:284:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:associated  with  key  aspects  of  the  quality  of  growth,  such  as  income  inequality  and 
22:539:40501:28:28:72:523:256:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental sustainability (Lopez et al., 2010). Calbick and Gunton (2014) suggest that 
22:540:40591:28:27:71:522:228:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:policy  factors  alone  account  for  much  of  the  variation  in  emissions  among  developed 
22:541:40687:27:28:72:523:201:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:countries.  This  relationship  is  of  great  interest  since,  if  a  positive  relationship  between 
22:542:40791:28:27:72:523:173:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government  expenditure  and  environmental  quality  can  be  established,  it  will  provide 
22:543:40886:27:28:72:522:146:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reassurance  to  macroeconomic  policy  makers  that  a  fiscal  spending  expansion  does  not 
22:544:40982:28:28:72:522:118:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:induce pollution and in fact may lead to a significant alleviating effect on environmental 
22:545:41073:28:0:72:523:90:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:degradation.  In  such  a  case,  fiscal  spending  could complement  the  efforts  to  improve 
23:546:41172:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental quality, rendering environmental policy easier and more cost efficient. Despite 
23:547:41266:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the potentially significant implications of fiscal spending on the environment, it is surprising 
23:548:41363:28:27:72:522:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  this  relationship  had  been  neglected  in  the  literature  and  only  recently  there  is  a 
23:549:41466:27:28:71:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:burgeoning  body  of  theoretical  and  empirical  studies  that  have  systematically  started  to 
23:550:41566:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:explore  it  (Lopez  et  al.  2011;  Halkos  and  Paizanos,  2013;  Bernauer  and  Koubi,  2013; 
23:551:41663:27:28:72:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Galinato and Islam, 2014). At the same time, as we have seen in Section 2, a large body of 
23:552:41754:28:38:72:465:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:empirical literature posits a relationship between economic growth and pollution/ 
23:553:41836:38:27:108:523:555:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Therefore,  the  framework  for  analysis  in  this  field  is  related  to  three  bodies  of 
23:554:41931:27:28:72:523:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:literature: (i) the literature linking fiscal policy to long3term growth and short3term income 
23:555:42026:28:27:72:522:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fluctuations;  (ii)  the  literature  on  the  growth3pollution  relationship;  and  (iii)  a  small  but 
23:556:42132:27:28:72:522:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growing  literature  on  the  effects  of  fiscal  policy on  the  environment.  Since  the  literature 
23:557:42236:28:28:72:526:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:examining the fiscal policy3growth is well3established and the growth3pollution relationship 
23:558:42329:28:27:72:522:417:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:has  been  already  reviewed  in  Section2,  this  section  focuses  on  how  fiscal  policy  affects 
23:559:42431:27:40:72:184:390:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental quality. 
23:560:42454:40:40:71:305:350:14:g_d0_f6:14:g_d0_f6:C:3.1. Fiscal policy and the environment  
23:561:42494:40:28:107:523:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:As  already  mentioned,  economic  theory  identifies  three  main  factors  which  are 
23:562:42582:28:27:72:523:282:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:important for production and to promote economic growth sustainability, namely, physical 
23:563:42671:27:28:72:523:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital, human capital and natural capital. Physical capital accumulation leads to economic 
23:564:42763:28:27:72:523:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:growth and eventually enhances welfare. On the other hand,  accumulation of human and 
23:565:42849:27:28:72:523:200:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:natural  capital  not  only  contributes  to  growth  by  boosting  total  factor  productivity  and 
23:566:42950:28:28:72:522:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:increasing  investment  returns,  but  these  forms  also  consist  direct  components  of  welfare 
23:567:43050:28:27:72:172:144:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Lopez et al. 2010).  
23:568:43072:27:0:72:75:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
24:569:43075:0:28:107:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Natural  capital,  which  comprises  natural  resources and  environmental  quality,  is 
24:570:43164:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered a public good, since it is characterized by significant externalities. Inadequacy to 
24:571:43260:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:internalize such externalities due to market failures, systematically leads to overexploitation 
24:572:43356:27:28:72:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of natural capital and degradation of environmental quality. Moreover, considering human 
24:573:43445:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital, there are limited incentives for the private sector and often for the public sector to 
24:574:43541:27:28:72:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:invest  on  that,  since  returns  of  investments  on  education,  knowledge  and  health  require 
24:575:43641:28:28:72:522:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:several years to materialize. This inherent gap in the optimum accumulation of human and 
24:576:43730:28:27:72:522:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:natural capital may ultimately imperil the sustainability of long3term growth. As discussed in 
24:577:43825:27:28:72:523:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the previous sections, when considering public goods and in the presence of externalities, 
24:578:43916:28:38:72:395:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:there is a significant role for government policies and intervention. 
24:579:43986:38:37:72:330:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:3.1.1. The effect of fiscal policy on the environment   
24:580:44042:37:28:108:523:435:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:An  important  tool  through  which  governments  can  alleviate  the  negative 
24:581:44122:28:27:72:523:407:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consequences of market failures and contribute to growth sustainability is the implementation 
24:582:44216:27:28:72:522:380:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of fiscal policy, especially taking into account that government expenditures often account 
24:583:44308:28:27:72:523:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for more than 30 percent of GDP. The mechanisms through which government expenditure 
24:584:44393:27:28:72:523:325:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and environment interact with each other were initially examined in theoretical papers by 
24:585:44483:28:28:72:289:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Heyes (2000), Lawn (2003) and Sim (2006). 
24:586:44525:28:27:108:522:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:More recently, according to Lopez et al. (2010), there are three reasons that render 
24:587:44610:27:28:72:523:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fiscal policy crucial in this framework. First, fiscal policy may determine the allocation of 
24:588:44704:28:27:72:523:214:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:resources  to  human  capital,  physical  capital  and  natural  capital  in  an  optimum  way  by 
24:589:44803:27:28:72:522:187:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:creating appropriate incentives through expenditure and tax policies. Second, implementation 
24:590:44896:28:28:72:523:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  fiscal  policy  can  generate  macroeconomic  expansions  and  contractions  and  determine 
24:591:44992:28:27:72:523:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:intergenerational  transfers  through  debt,  social  security,  taxation  on  the  use  of  natural 
24:592:45093:27:28:72:523:104:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:resources and pollution and finally, by expenditures on mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
24:593:45187:28:0:72:523:76:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Third, there is also the possibility that fiscal policy may harm environmental quality. For 
25:594:45282:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:example, government may succumb to lobbies and interest groups and offer subsidies and tax 
25:595:45373:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exemptions and thus, encourage resource extraction, depletion, and generation of emissions 
25:596:45464:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that contribute to the deterioration of environmental quality. This highlights the requirement 
25:597:45559:27:28:72:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for high institutional quality and political freedom that can promote good governance and 
25:598:45649:28:27:72:197:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:help avoid bad practices.  
25:599:45676:27:28:108:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Furthermore, five more ways through which fiscal policy can affect environmental 
25:600:45757:28:28:72:523:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quality  may  be  additionally  identified.  First,  as  the  size  of  government  increases  as  a 
25:601:45858:28:27:71:523:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:percentage  of  GDP,  progressively  the  structure  of  production  in  the  economy  changes  in 
25:602:45957:27:28:72:522:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:favour of the service sector, which is less pollution intensive compared to the industrial and 
25:603:46052:28:27:72:522:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rural  sectors.  Second,  government  spending  on  public  order  and  safety  reinforces  the 
25:604:46148:27:28:71:523:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:protection of property rights which may in turn alleviate environmental externalities such as 
25:605:46242:28:28:72:523:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  overexploitation  of  natural  resources  and  assist  the  enforcement  of  environmental 
25:606:46338:28:27:72:523:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regulations. Third, public spending in education and health can increase public awareness 
25:607:46428:27:28:72:523:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regarding the adverse effects of environmental pollution and therefore increase demand for 
25:608:46519:28:27:72:523:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:improved environmental quality. Moreover, a greater educational level may also contribute to 
25:609:46612:27:28:72:523:345:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the control of population growth rate that can reduce environmental pressures. Moreover, if 
25:610:46704:28:28:72:522:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the environment is considered a luxury public good, it is likely that it will only be demanded 
25:611:46799:28:27:72:523:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when the demand for other public goods has been satisfied, i.e. at large levels of government 
25:612:46893:27:28:72:522:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:size (Frederik and Lundström, 2001). Finally, investment in infrastructure, such as the public 
25:613:46988:28:27:72:523:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:transportation  system,  can  reduce  environmental  degradation  by  encouraging  more

25:617:47321:27:28:72:523:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  therefore  can  influence  environmental  quality  indirectly  through  this  channel.  These

26:623:47652:38:27:108:523:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Despite the potentially significant implications of fiscal spending on environmental 
26:624:47737:27:28:71:523:359:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution, it is surprising that this relationship was not considered in the literature and only 
26:625:47834:28:28:72:523:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:recently  theoretical  and  empirical  studies  have  systematically  started  to  explore  it.  A

26:627:48028:27:28:72:430:276:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is presented in the respective sections of Chapters 335 of this dissertation.  
26:628:48107:28:27:108:523:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:It is important however to mention at this point, that the mechanism through which 
26:629:48190:27:28:72:523:221:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government  expenditure  may  affect  environmental  degradation  is  expected  to  differ, 
26:630:48282:28:28:72:523:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:according  to  the  generating  source  of  the  pollutants  and  in  particular  whether  they  are 
26:631:48383:28:27:71:523:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:production  or  consumption  generated.  These  differences  are  important  since  they  can 
26:632:48477:27:28:72:523:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influence  the  magnitude  and  the  significance  of  the  estimated  effect  of  government 
26:633:48571:28:27:72:523:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditure  on  different  indicators  of  pollution.  The  theoretical  underpinnings  of  this 
26:634:48669:27:0:72:523:83:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationship are hereby sketched, based on the models proposed by Lopez et al. (2011) and 
27:635:48762:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Galinato and Islam (2014). Both these studies focused on the effect of the composition of 
27:636:48852:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government expenditure, i.e. of the share of public goods in total government expenditure, on 
27:637:48946:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the environment. In their research, public goods are defined broadly to include expenditures 
27:638:49039:27:28:72:523:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that complement rather than substitute for production in the private economy and comprise 
27:639:49129:28:27:72:523:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such functional categories of expenditure as spending on education, health, social security, 
27:640:49222:27:28:72:523:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:transport,  communication,  public  order  and  safety, housing  and  community  amenities, 
27:641:49314:28:28:72:423:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental protection and finally, spending on religion and culture.

27:644:49520:28:27:72:523:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:international trade on environmental quality, suggest four main mechanisms through which 
27:645:49609:27:29:72:427:483:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government expenditure can affect environmental pollution, as follows:    
27:646:49683:29:28:90:168:454:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Scale effect 
27:647:49697:28:27:71:523:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Depending  on  the  relationship  between  fiscal  spending  and  economic  growth,  increased 
27:648:49792:27:29:71:416:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government spending may amplify or reduce environmental pressures.  
27:649:49860:29:27:89:207:370:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f7:A:• Composition effect 
27:650:49879:27:28:107:522:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Government  expenditure  may  favor  human  capital  intensive  instead  of  physical 
27:651:49965:28:27:72:523:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital intensive activities which are more pollution3generating inputs, and therefore is likely 
27:652:50062:27:29:72:457:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to improve environmental quality by modifying the output mix of the economy. 
27:653:50139:29:27:89:195:259:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Technique effect 
27:654:50157:27:28:107:523:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Government  expenditure  in  education  and  health  encourages  the  accumulation  of 
27:655:50244:28:28:72:522:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human  capital  and  is  associated  with  greater  labor efficiency.  To  the  extent  that  human 
27:656:50344:28:27:72:523:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:capital and physical capital are substitutes in production, it is likely that a greater provision of 
27:657:50445:27:28:72:523:149:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human  capital  would  encourage  more  environmentally friendly  production  and  therefore 
27:658:50538:28:27:72:523:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reduce  the  pollution  per  unit  of  output.  Furthermore,  government  spending  in  R&D  may 
27:659:50635:27:0:72:496:94:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:further enhance knowledge diffusion and lead to the adoption of cleaner technologies.    
28:660:50727:0:27:90:180:757:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Income effect 
28:661:50742:27:28:108:526:730:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Depending  on  the  relationship  between  fiscal  spending  and  economic  growth, 
28:662:50826:28:27:71:523:702:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditures on public goods can also induce an income effect, according to which increased 
28:663:50918:27:28:71:523:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:income raises the demand for improved environmental quality and thus more environmental 
28:664:51006:28:27:71:339:647:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:regulation, which consequently may reduce pollution.   
28:665:51061:27:28:108:523:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The analysis of Lopez et al. (2011) suggests that the effect of government expenditure 
28:666:51148:28:28:72:523:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:on environmental pollution, ceteris paribus, is strictly non3positive when a) there is a larger 
28:667:51244:28:27:72:523:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:output elasticity of public goods in the non3polluting sector compared to the polluting sector 
28:668:51339:27:28:72:526:537:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and b) the marginal utility of consumption is elastic9. Moreover, if both the above mentioned 
28:669:51433:28:27:71:522:509:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:assumptions hold, a shift in fiscal spending from private subsidies to public goods is expected 
28:670:51529:27:28:71:349:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to cause a reduction in production3generated pollution.

28:673:51630:27:28:108:523:399:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Galinato and Islam (2014) recognized that the mechanism that connects consumption3
28:674:51712:28:27:72:523:371:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:generated pollution and government expenditure must consider the ways that government 
28:675:51798:27:28:72:522:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:spending affects consumers’ budget, income and prices.  In particular, they suggested that 
28:676:51889:28:28:72:523:316:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government expenditure might affect consumption3generated pollution through the following 
28:677:51979:28:28:72:141:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:two channels: 
28:678:51993:28:28:90:176:260:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Scale effect10 
28:679:52008:28:27:107:523:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Fiscal spending on sectors like health and education increases the current and future 
28:680:52094:27:28:72:481:205:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:income of households and may in turn lead to an increase of consumption pollution.  
28:681:52178:28:27:107:110:177:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A: 
28:682:52178:27:18:107:110:150:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:

28:684:52226:8:16:71:523:124:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:9  The  assumption  that  the  elasticity  of  consumption is  greater  than  1  is  supported  by  several  studies. For 
28:685:52348:16:11:72:74:108:10:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f7:F:example, see Evans (2005). 10
28:686:52377:11:12:78:523:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F: It should be noted that Galinato and Islam (2014) define this effect as income effect; however we refrain using 
28:687:52490:12:11:71:523:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:this definition here, in order to avoid confusion with the income effect on production3generated pollution which 
28:688:52603:11:0:71:449:74:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:tends to reduce environmental pollution. For a similar approach see Islam and Lopez (2015).   
29:689:52698:0:27:90:210:757:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Regulations effect11 
29:690:52719:27:28:107:523:730:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Government expenditure encourages the development of institutions and therefore the 
29:691:52803:28:27:72:523:702:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:establishment and enforcement of environmental regulations which enhance environmental 
29:692:52890:27:28:72:522:675:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quality (Fullerton and Kim 2008). For example, such a regulation is the introduction of a 
29:693:52980:28:27:71:339:647:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution tax which changes the output price of a good. 
29:694:53036:27:28:72:188:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Other relevant channels 
29:695:53059:28:28:107:523:592:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Furthermore, the following two mechanisms are expected to be significant in both 
29:696:53140:28:27:71:523:564:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:production3 and consumption3generated pollution and interact with the effect of government

29:698:53269:29:27:89:211:508:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Governance quality 
29:699:53289:27:28:107:523:481:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Galinato and Islam (2014) emphasize the importance of governance quality in this 
29:700:53370:28:27:71:523:453:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:framework. In particular, they suggest that in democratic regimes, where it is more likely to 
29:701:53464:27:28:71:523:426:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:adopt  stricter  environmental  instruments  compared  to  non3democratic  administrations,  the 
29:702:53561:28:28:71:523:398:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effect of environmental regulations has been found to dominate that of the scale effect and 
29:703:53653:28:27:71:522:370:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:therefore lead to a reduction of consumption pollution. Likewise, it is expected that enhanced 
29:704:53748:27:28:71:522:343:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:institutional quality may reinforce also the alleviating effect of government expenditure on 
29:705:53841:28:29:71:212:315:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:production3related pollution. 
29:706:53871:29:27:89:227:286:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f6:C:• Special interest groups 
29:707:53896:27:27:107:523:259:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Special  interest  groups  that  support  a  large  government  in  order  to  gain  private 
29:708:53989:27:28:71:522:232:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:benefits can lead to environmental degradation, particularly if the dominant special interest 
29:709:54083:28:28:71:523:204:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:groups  are  not  promoters  of  environmental  quality  and  influence  the  strictness  of 
29:710:54176:28:27:71:523:176:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental regulation the government imposes (Mueller and Murrell 1986; Bernauer and

29:712:54363:28:24:71:526:121:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reported that labour union strength is negatively associated with air pollution, a finding that is

29:714:54510:7:16:71:521:90:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:11 This effect is also relevant in production3generated pollution, however its importance is expected to be greater 
29:715:54626:16:0:72:208:74:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in consumption3related pollution. 
30:716:54663:0:28:72:523:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consistent with this interpretation. The greater the strength of interest groups that tend to lose 
30:717:54762:28:28:72:523:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from stricter environmental policies, the higher the environmental degradation is likely to be 
30:718:54857:28:27:72:523:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Bernauer  and  Koubi,  2009).  This  mechanism  may  influence  the  effect  of  government 
30:719:54950:27:28:72:522:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditure  on  pollution  since  the  existence  of  such  groups  is  associated  with  greater

30:724:55258:28:27:72:518:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:effect of government size on pollution. In an early study, Frederik and Lundstrom (2001) 
30:725:55347:27:28:72:521:501:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:suggested that greater economic freedom, in terms of lower government size, reduces CO2 
30:726:55434:28:27:72:519:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emissions when the size of government is small, but increases emissions when the initial size 
30:727:55528:27:28:72:519:446:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of government is large. In a related work, Bernauer and Koubi (2013) found that an increase 
30:728:55620:28:27:72:519:418:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the government spending share of GDP is associated with more air pollution and this 
30:729:55707:27:28:72:519:391:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationship is not affected by the quality of the government. In addition, several studies 
30:730:55799:28:28:71:518:363:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provide  a  theoretical  basis  for  determining  the  effect  of  government  expenditure  on 
30:731:55894:28:27:71:518:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution, emphasizing the importance of fiscal spending composition (Lopez et al., 2011; 
30:732:55984:27:38:72:206:308:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Galinato and Islam, 2014).  
30:733:56012:38:27:108:519:270:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In particular, these studies have shown that a reallocation of government spending 
30:734:56095:27:28:72:518:243:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:composition  towards  social  and  public  goods  reduces  pollution  while  increasing  total 
30:735:56190:28:28:72:518:215:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:government size, without changing its orientation, has a negative or non3positive effect on 
30:736:56282:28:27:72:519:187:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental pollution. Given this background, there is still scope for future research that 
30:737:56376:27:28:72:519:160:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:explicitly examines several dimensions of this relationship that have not been sufficiently 
30:738:56468:28:0:72:223:132:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:considered in previous studies. 
31:739:56503:0:28:108:519:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:First, as already mentioned, there is established evidence on the link between fiscal 
31:740:56589:28:28:71:519:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:policy  and  growth,  as  well  as  on  the  relationship  between  growth  and  pollution.  These 
31:741:56688:28:27:71:519:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationships imply that fiscal policy, to the extent that it affects economic growth, might 
31:742:56781:27:28:71:519:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also  indirectly  influence  environmental  quality  through  this  channel.  However,  existing 
31:743:56878:28:27:71:519:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:research, with the exception of Halkos and Paizanos (2013), ignores this mechanism and 
31:744:56965:27:28:71:519:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:therefore the reported results in the literature capture only part of the effect of government 
31:745:57060:28:38:71:198:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditure on pollution.  
31:746:57087:38:27:107:519:555:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In addition, it is well documented that environmental quality is influenced by various 
31:747:57174:27:28:71:518:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:other factors, apart from fiscal policy and economic growth, including political institutions, 
31:748:57269:28:27:71:518:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:population, trade and investment (Grossman and Krueger, 1995; Halkos, 2013a; Bernauer 
31:749:57355:27:28:71:519:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and Koubi, 2009; Zhu and Peng, 2012; Cole and Elliott, 2003). Some of these characteristics 
31:750:57447:28:28:71:519:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:may interact with government expenditure and influence its effect on environmental quality. 
31:751:57539:28:27:71:519:417:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In this regard, it is highly unlikely that the effect of government spending on pollution is 
31:752:57632:27:28:71:519:390:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:independent from country specific characteristics. For example, Galinato and Islam (2014) 
31:753:57722:28:27:71:518:362:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:have given credibility to the hypothesis that the magnitude of the direct effect of government 
31:754:57817:27:28:71:519:335:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditure  on  pollution  depends  on  whether  a  specific  country  has  a  democratic  or 
31:755:57912:28:38:71:164:307:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:autocratic regime.  
31:756:57932:38:27:107:518:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Furthermore, the level of economic development might also affect the magnitude of 
31:757:58014:27:28:71:519:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the relationship between fiscal spending and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, all 
31:758:58104:28:27:71:519:214:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:but  one12  of  the  studies  that  examine  the  direct  effect  of  government  expenditure  on 
31:759:58202:27:28:71:518:187:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environmental quality, report a unified estimate based on a world sample of countries. Since 
31:760:58295:28:28:71:522:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this approach may lead to omitted variable bias, future research should identify and estimate 
31:761:58389:28:27:71:519:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  distinct  channels  which  may  influence  the  direct  effect  of  government  spending  on 
31:762:58487:27:18:71:120:104:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution. 
31:763:58498:18:8:71:218:86:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:                                                 
31:764:58546:8:0:71:191:78:6:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:12 Galinato and Islam (2014). 
32:765:58579:0:28:108:518:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Another  interesting  aspect  to  explore  is  how  the  effect  of  fiscal  policy  varies 
32:766:58671:28:28:72:519:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:according to the different characteristics of the pollutants. The mechanisms through which 
32:767:58762:28:27:72:519:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:fiscal policy affects pollution might differ according to the source of pollution, i.e. whether 
32:768:58858:27:28:71:518:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollution is production3 or consumption3generated (McAusland, 2008; Lopez et al., 2011; 
32:769:58946:28:27:72:519:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Galinato and Islam 2014). Furthermore, depending on the atmospheric life characteristics 
32:770:59035:27:28:72:519:621:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  geographical  range  of  the  effect  of  different  pollutants,  emissions  externalities  may 
32:771:59136:28:28:72:519:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:range  from  local  and  immediate  to  those  that  are  global  and  occur  mostly  in  the  future 
32:772:59238:28:37:72:209:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Shafik, 1994; Cole, 2007).  
32:773:59267:37:28:108:519:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:However, only one study (Islam and Lopez, 2015) takes into account these important 
32:774:59350:28:27:72:518:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:distinctions  and  reports  estimates  on  both  production3  and  consumption3generated 
32:775:59439:27:28:71:519:473:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollutants,  however  all  the  pollutants  used  in  that  work  refer  to  local  environmental 
32:776:59537:28:28:72:518:445:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:degradation.  Further  analysis  should  incorporate  several  indicators  of  environmental 
32:777:59630:28:27:72:518:417:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:degradation  and  therefore  report  estimates,  on  each  of  the  aforementioned  categories  of 
32:778:59729:27:38:71:287:390:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pollutants, which can be directly compared.  
32:779:59774:38:27:108:519:352:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Furthermore,  the  empirical  studies  dealing  with  the  effect  of  fiscal  policy  on  the 
32:780:59869:27:28:71:519:325:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:environment  use  reduced3form  models  and  estimate  the  long3term  effect  of  government 
32:781:59963:28:28:71:518:297:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:spending.  Thus,  implicitly  they  make  strong  assumptions  about  the  lack  of  correlation 
32:782:60060:28:27:71:518:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between  government expenditure and other fiscal variables which are excluded from the 
32:783:60147:27:28:71:519:242:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:model,  assumptions  that  would  appear  unlikely  to  hold  in  general,  as  pointed  out  by 
32:784:60244:28:27:71:522:214:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Blanchard and Perotti (2002). To alleviate such concerns, future research could focus on 
32:785:60333:27:28:71:518:187:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:drawing structural conclusions using Vector Autoregression methods which are solely based 
32:786:60423:28:28:71:518:159:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:on  minimal  hypotheses  about  the  signs  of  the  impacts  of  certain  shocks  (Faust,  1998; 
32:787:60521:28:27:71:518:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Canova and de Nicolo, 1998; Uhlig, 2005; Mountford and Uhlig; 2009). This approach has 
32:788:60608:27:0:71:519:104:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  additional  advantage  to  provide  insights  regarding  the  short3term  interrelationships 
33:789:60709:0:28:71:518:759:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between  fiscal  policy  and  environmental  degradation.  Such  analysis  could  also  offer 
33:790:60803:28:38:72:498:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indications regarding the effect of a tax3cut based fiscal expansion on the environment.   
33:791:60894:38:27:108:518:693:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Finally, the empirical analysis should employ appropriate econometric techniques in 
33:792:60978:27:28:72:518:666:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:order to take into account the dynamic nature of the examined relationships. In particular, 
33:793:61070:28:27:72:519:638:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:when  large  N  and  T  dimensions  data  are  employed,  non3stationarity  and  the  potential 
33:794:61166:27:28:72:519:611:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dynamic  misspecification  of  the  pollutants  equations  should  be  explicitly  considered 
33:795:61260:28:28:72:519:583:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Halkos,  2003;  Christopoulos  and  Tsionas,  2004).  Static  models,  which  are  used  in  the 
33:796:61358:28:27:72:519:555:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:majority  of  the  works  in  this  literature,  assume  that  adjustments  to  any  shock  occur 
33:797:61456:27:28:72:518:528:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:instantaneously, however this could only be justified in equilibrium or if the adjustment 
33:798:61546:28:28:72:518:500:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mechanism  is  rapid  and  is  highly  unlikely,  considering  that  the  return  to  long3run 
33:799:61641:28:0:72:444:472:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equilibrium emission levels can be relatively slow (Perman and Stern, 1999).
